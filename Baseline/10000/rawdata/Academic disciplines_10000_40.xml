The '''Academy of Military Engineering of Guadalajara''' ({{lang-es|Academia de Ingenieros de Guadalajara}}) was a [[military academy]] in [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]], [[Spain]]. It operated in Guadalajara from 1833 until its move to [[Segovia]] in 1932 as part of its merger with the Artillery Academy (''Academia de Artilleros'').

The Academy was located in the Montesclaros Palace, in the west of the city, until a 1924 fire destroyed part of the premises and an important collection of models, documents, books, and artworks.  Between 1924 and its final move, its activities were continued in the palace's annex buildings that today serve as the General Military Archive of Guadalajara (''Archivo General Militar de Guadalajara'') and the palace of Antonio de Mendoza.

Many important figures attended or taught at the Academy, including [[Mariano Barberán]], [[Eduardo Barrón]],&lt;ref name="aeroplano"&gt;Warleta Carrillo, José (1989). «Revista Aeroplano nº 6».

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4374">The '''Antwerp School''' was a school of artists active in [[Antwerp]], first during the 16th century when the city was the economic center of the [[Low Countries]], and then during the 17th century when it became the artistic stronghold of the [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] under [[Peter Paul Rubens]].

==History==
Antwerp took over from [[Bruges]] as the main trading and commercial center of the [[Low Countries]] around 1500. Painters, artists and craftsmen joined the [[Guild of Saint Luke]], which educated apprentices and guaranteed quality.

The first school of artists that emerged in the city were the [[Antwerp Mannerism|Antwerp Mannerists]], a group of anonymous late [[Gothic art|Gothic]] painters active in the city from about 1500 to 1520. They were followed by [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] painters in the Italian tradition that developed at the end of the [[High Renaissance]]. [[Jan Gossaert]] was a major artist in the city at this time. Other artists, such as [[Frans Floris]], continued this style.

The [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] riots ('[[Beeldenstorm]]' in Dutch) of 1566 that preceded the [[Dutch Revolt]] resulted in the destruction of many works of religious art, after which time the churches and monasteries had to be refurnished and redecorated. Artists such as [[Otto van Veen]] and members of the [[Francken]] family, working in a late mannerist style, provided new religious decoration. It also marked a beginning of economic decline in the city, as the [[Scheldt]] river was blockaded by the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1585 diminishing trade.

[[File:Paul de Vos, Ark van Noah.jpg|thumb|left|Paul de Vos, ''Ark van Noah'']]The city experienced an artistic renewal in the 17th century. The large workshops of [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Jacob Jordaens]], and the influence of [[Anthony van Dyck]], made Antwerp the center of the Flemish Baroque.  The city was an internationally significant publishing centre, and had a huge production of [[old master print]]s and book illustrations.  Antwerp ''[[animalier]]s'' or animal painters, such as [[Frans Snyders]], [[Jan Fyt]] and [[Paul de Vos]] dominated this speciality in Europe for at least the first half of the century.  Many artists joined the [[Guild of Romanists]], a society for which having visited Rome was a condition of membership. But as the economy continued to decline, and the [[Habsburg]] Governors and the Church reduced their patronage, many artists trained in Antwerp left for the Netherlands, England, France or elsewhere, and by the end of the 17th century Antwerp was no longer a major centre for art.

The artistic legacy of Antwerp is represented in many museums, and paintings of the Antwerp School are valued at [[auction]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11783">[[Image:Sadlers_Wells_Theatre_edited.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A performance at Sadler's Wells, circa 1808.]]
The [[:Category:Theatrical genres|theatrical genre]] of '''aqua drama''' that was popular in 19th century France, England, and the United States involved flooding the arenas of circuses for recreations of major naval conflicts and similar aquatic events;  some venues participated to such a great extent in this once-popular form as to install permanent water-tanks on stage.&lt;ref name=H17&gt;Harrison, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Water-based spectacles, especially those portraying great naval battles, had been popular in Roman times, when they were known as ''[[naumachia]]'', and the custom was resurrected at various times during the [[Middle Ages]].

== Beginning ==
At the start of the 19th century, the already established [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] came under the management of Charles Dibdin, Jr., a man who had big plans for the theatre's future. In 1804, he installed a large 90x24x3ft water tank that covered the entire stage.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Jane Austin's World&lt;/ref&gt; The water used to fill the tank was pumped in from the New River, which was adjacent to the theatre, by an Archimedes wheel.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Arundell p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; This process took twelve men twelve hours: four men would work in four hour shifts and then rotate until the entire tank was full.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Even though the tanks were drained and refilled every three weeks they would become filthy. The water would become dirty not only from the shows, but the actors would bathe in the tank, along with rowdy audience members jumping in to see if the water was real.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Lewis&lt;/ref&gt; The Aquatic Drama was popular in the early 19th century, and with Sadler's Wells on the outskirts of London, the audiences, especially in the pit were unruly, loud, and most likely drunk.&lt;ref&gt;Goldfarb and Edwin 397&lt;/ref&gt; The large water tank that these disruptive audience members would jump into was not the only tank in the theatre, Dibdin Jr. had a second 5x5x5 ft tank above the theatre that was used to simulate waterfalls.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==19th century performances==
The first show Dibdin, Jr. and his crew put on was ''The Siege of Gibralter.'' It opened in 1804, and it was a play that depicted the naval battle between the English Navy and the Spanish Armada.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A playbill from this performance describes the battle in the show:

''"the conflagration of the town in various places, the defense of the garrison, and attack by the floating batteries, [which] is so faithfully and naturally represented, that when the floating batteries take fire, some blowing up with a dreadful explosion, and others, after burning to the water’s edge, sink to the bottom; while the gallant Sir Roger Curtis appears in his boat to save the drowning Spaniards, the British tars for that purpose plunging into the water, the effect is such as to produce an unprecedented climax of astonishment and applause."''&lt;ref&gt;Nicoll p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

There were 177 ships on the liquid stage, all equipped with live guns and ready for battle.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Over a hundred real scale sized naval ships would not have been able to fit in Sadler's Wells tanks, so Dibdin hired men who worked at the [[Woolwich Dockyard]]s to build him smaller ships built at a one-inch per foot scale, with exact detailed imitation down to the rigging.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Children were cast as some of the Spanish naval officers manning the tiny ships, and were seen “drowning” after the Spanish had been defeated.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The climactic battle of the show was when the English and Spanish went head on, full force, with guns blazing, and the audience members saw incredible spectacle as the English triumphantly destroyed the Spanish Armada.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Arundell p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1823 Sadler's Wells presented the aqua drama entitled ''The Island or Christian and His Comrades'' which dramatized the main events of the [[Mutiny on the Bounty|Mutiny on board HMS ''Bounty'']].&lt;ref name=k55&gt;Kirk, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; In order to alleviate a twenty-minute delay between a dry land scene and an aquatic scene, the stage was made to ascend to near the roof of the theatre, in full view of the audience.&lt;ref name=L4&gt;Ledger, p. f&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Fall ==
Eventually the aqua drama slash began to ripple then calm as audience members were no longer pleased with what was being performed at Sadler's Wells. This could have been due to the fact that Dibdin, Jr. tried to reuse many of his 177 ships from the ''Siege of Gibraltar,'' and they were no longer new and exciting to the audiences, but also the Napoleonic wars could have contributed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to Dan Cuickshank at BBC News, the Napoleonic wars were raging on during the early 1800s and England dipped its toes in the war waters in 1793 with the new Revolutionary France. After a decade of fighting the two countries finally signed at the Treaty of Amiens, which only lasted a month until in May 1803 war broke out between the two countries again.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Cuickshank&lt;/ref&gt; The initial declaration of war could have sparked a rise in nationalism with in England, being a contributing factor into the Dibden, Jr. and his aquatic drama's success. Britain was known for having a large and powerful navy, and they didn't mind flexing their muscles as they asserted themselves as the most powerful navy in Europe at the 1815 after their victory at Waterloo.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The citizens of England would have known how powerful their countries navy was. Seeing shows, such as the ones being put at Sadler's Wells, reminded the English people of how strong their military was, making them feel proud and safe initially. Yet, after a few years into the war the citizens began to realize the horrors of war. According to Mather, they were exposed not only to the death of friends and family along with the fear of invasion, but also the raising of taxes to fund the military.&lt;ref&gt;Mather&lt;/ref&gt; A staggering 11.6 million, which is around 570 million pounds in today's market, was spent on forts alone, most of which were protecting dock yards.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The British people became fed up with war, especially naval combat and eventually the tanks were taken out of the theatre. Removal of the tanks due to lack of popularity reflects the English nation's view of war.

== Legacy ==
Even though the tanks were removed in 1824, aqua drama was a part of a long lasting theatre's history. The legacy left behind of aquatic theatre is only a few pages in books and websites, and a painting or two, but Sadler's Wells legacy has been alive and well since Richard Sadler first opened his music house in 1683.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Crompton&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the theatre has seen many triumphs and tragedies. After Charles Dibdin, Jr. resigned there was a false fire alarm during one of the shows which lead to 18 people being stampeded to death.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1843 the theater was once again successful, as the actor manager Samuel Philips put on Shakespeare's plays. Sadly, in 1915 the doors to Sadler's Wells were closed. Lilian Baylis, who wanted everyone in London to have the privilege to see the mesmerizing art of theatre, raised the money to reopen Sadler's Wells. The Sadler's Wells legacy continued as it was once again able to share theatre's magic with the people of northern London in 1931. After many years of putting on progressive theatre that entertained northern London, the play aspect of Sadler's Wells eventually faded out, opera and dance became prominent. Around 1945 Sadler's Wells started to become a strictly dance performance hall. The theatre legacy was replaced over the next half century as the once music hall become an outstanding, well respected dance hall. Sadler's Wells still stands today, not in the same building, but with the murky water of Charles Dibdin, Jr.’s aquatic theatre running in its historic veins.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== New York ==
[[New York City]]'s [[Lafayette Circus (Theatre)|Lafayette Circus]] (1826-1829) boasted equipment for both [[Hippodrama|equestrian, or "Hippodrama"]], and aquatic dramas.&lt;ref name=B1136&gt;Banham, p. 1136&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 4, 1840, The [[Bowery Theatre]] in [[New York City]] produced ''The Pirates Signal''.  An immense stage was entirely covered by water upon which a full-rigged ship maneuvered. The scene took place upon the decks of the ship itself.&lt;ref name=B17&gt;Brown, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television==

===Australia===
In [[Australia]] UHF channel allocations are 7&amp;nbsp;MHz wide.  Band IV includes channels 28 to 35, with base frequencies of 529.5&amp;nbsp;MHz to 578.5&amp;nbsp;MHz.  More details are available on the [[Australian_and_New_Zealand_television_frequencies|television frequencies]] page.

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]] UHF channel allocations are 8&amp;nbsp;MHz wide.  Band IV includes channels 25 to 35, with base frequencies of 506.0&amp;nbsp;MHz to 586.0&amp;nbsp;MHz.  More details are available on the [[Australian_and_New_Zealand_television_frequencies|television frequencies]] page.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[UK]], Band IV allocations are 8&amp;nbsp;MHz wide, traditionally consisting of 14 channels from UHF 21 to 34 inclusive. However, in the mid-1990s the squeezing of analogue [[Five (TV channel)|Channel 5]] broadcasts into the existing national terrestrial TV transmitter network effectively closed a gap between bands IV and V, which was previously reserved for [[radar]] applications and home consumer devices. This stretched the practical definition of Band IV in the UK to cover 18 channels from UHF 21 to 38 inclusive.&lt;ref name="ds1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/terrestrial/tuning/|title=UHF channel and frequency guide|accessdate=2007-05-17|publisher=Digital Spy Limited| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070518172927/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/terrestrial/tuning/| archivedate= 18 May 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aerials of the ''group A'' type cover this band.&lt;ref name="atv1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerialsandtv.com/aerials.html#aerialgroups|title=Aerial Groups / Widebands|accessdate=2009-05-17|publisher=A.T.V.

The following table covers the most inclusive definition of Band IV in the UK. Rows with a yellow background indicate channels which were not traditionally (before the mid-1990s) considered part of Band IV for TV broadcasting purposes and may not be considered part of the band in other countries (e.g. Switzerland&lt;ref name="sfoc1" /&gt;).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4512">'''Cluster criticism''' is a method of [[rhetorical criticism]] in which a critic examines the structural relations and associative meanings between certain main ideas, concepts, or subjects present in a text. 

==Method== 
There are three steps in performing a cluster criticism: identifying key terms, creating clusters from associated elements, and examining and comparing clusters.&lt;ref name="isbn1-57766-318-7"&gt;{{cite book |author=Foss, Sonja K. |title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice |publisher=Waveland Pr Inc |location= |year=1996 |chapter=Cluster Criticism |pages=367–70 |isbn=1-57766-318-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Identify Key Terms===
First, key terms are identified.  These are generally the ideas, subjects, topics, or arguments that work discusses.  They usually (but not always) occur more often than any other element in the work; they can also be identified in a work's introduction.  
===Create Clusters from Associated Elements===
Next, the critic identifies surrounding elements in the text that refer to or are associated with each of the key terms.  Each collection of associated elements which refer to the same key term is called a cluster.  
===Examine and Compare Clusters===
In the final step of the criticism, the critic examines how each specific cluster represents its referring key term.  This process typically includes directly contrasting one cluster with another.  By doing this, a critic can determine how a text privileges one key term over others.

This stage of cluster criticism can incorporate other methods in [[rhetorical criticism]].  For example, if different types of [[metaphor]]s are found in different clusters, a critic can perform multiple [[metaphoric criticism]]s in order to show how each key term characterizes a particular position or entity.

==Example==
The following is an excerpt from a speech titled [[s:Americanism (Harding)|"Americanism"]] given by [[Warren G. Harding]] in 1920 regarding aid to European nations devastated by World War I.  Terms '''bolded''' are those a critic might associate with the key term "Old World stabilization" and terms &lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt; are those a critic might associate with the key term "stabilize America."
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It's time to '''idealize''', but it's very &lt;u&gt;practical&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;make sure&lt;/u&gt; our own &lt;u&gt;house&lt;/u&gt; is in perfect &lt;u&gt;order&lt;/u&gt; before we '''attempt''' the '''miracle''' of '''Old World stabilization'''. Call it the &lt;u&gt;selfishness of nationality&lt;/u&gt; if you will. I think it's an &lt;u&gt;inspiration&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;patriotic devotion&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;safeguard&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;, to &lt;u&gt;stabilize America&lt;/u&gt; first, to &lt;u&gt;prosper&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;, to &lt;u&gt;think&lt;/u&gt; of &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;, to &lt;u&gt;exalt&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;, to &lt;u&gt;live&lt;/u&gt; for and &lt;u&gt;revere&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;. Let the '''internationalist''' '''dream''' and the '''Bolshevist''' '''destroy'''.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In this example, the critic would examine the cluster of words and phrases around the key term "Old world stabilization" in order to find certain patterns.  Terms like idealize, miracle, dream, and attempt depict reconstruction through aid as an unproven strategy; internationalist and Bolshevist characterize supporters of aid as foreign and Communist; and the ending word 'destroy' implies a disastrous consequence for the proposal.  In all, a critic can assume that these clusters work together to present aid for European reconstruction as an irresponsible and un-American plan. 

In stark contrast, the terms in the cluster around "stabilize America" construct a rejection of the proposal as the only responsible and American choice.  Terms like make sure, think, practical, order, safeguard, live, and prosper construct a refusal of European reconstruction as safe and sensible.  The words inspiration, exalt, and revere function with the phrases "patriotic devotion" and "selfishness of nationality" to characterize a refusal of aid as a positive, patriotic act.  Finally, the repeated phrase "America first" dichotomizes the issue into a choice between placing America or Europe first, with no middle ground.

The conclusion of this cluster criticism would therefore be that Harding advances his argument by constructing European aid as an irresponsible and un-American policy and a rejection of aid as a responsible, pro-American policy as well as framing the issue as an irreconcilable choice between the interests of America and Europe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42136">The '''conservation and restoration of film''' is the physical care and treatment of film-based materials (plastic supports). These include photographic materials and motion picture.

== Film supports ==

=== Cellulose nitrate ===
[[Cellulose nitrate]] (circa 1889 - circa 1950) is the first of film supports. It can be found as roll film, motion picture film, and sheet film. It is difficult to determine the dates when all nitrate film was discontinued, however, Eastman Kodak last manufactured nitrate film in 1951.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/webfm_send/302|title=Photographic Negatives: Nature and Evolution of Process|last=Valverde|first=Maria Fernanda|date=2005|website=Image Permanence Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cellulose nitrate is cellulose fibers modified with nitric acid to create a nitrocellulose solid.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Cellulose nitrate is extremely flammable and capable of burning even in the absence of oxygen and underwater. It has been the cause of many fires and losses of motion picture films, photographic materials, and archival records.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

=== Cellulose acetate ===
[[Cellulose acetate]] is also known as "safety" film and started to replace nitrate film in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; There are several types of acetate that were produced after 1925, which include diacetate (circa 1923-circa 1955), acetate propionate (1927-circa 1949), acetate butyrate (1936-present), and triacetate (circa 1950-present).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The earliest, diacetate, was found to be inferior to nitrate because it had high shrinkage rates.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Eastman Kodak then worked with mixed esters of cellulose to create acetate butyrate and acetate propionate, which were used for sheet film, X-rays, amateur roll film, and aerial maps, but they were still found to be inferior to nitrate by the motion picture industry.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Triacetate was then produced and is still in production for roll film today.

=== Polyester ===
[[Polyester]] (1955 - present) started to replace acetate as a film support for many types of sheet film; however, due to its rigidity, it cannot be used as roll film.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Polyester can also be identified as "safety" film. It is inherently more stable than both cellulose nitrate and cellulose acetate, because it is a synthetic polymer that is inert (chemically inactive). It shows exceptional chemical stability and physical performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A '''[https://www.nps.gov/museum/coldstorage/pdf/2.3.1b.pdf polarization test]''' can be used to identify polyester from cellulose acetate or nitrate. When viewed between cross-polarized filters, polyester will exhibit red and green interference colors, similar to a rainbow moiré pattern. Nitrate and acetate films will not show these interference colors.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.1-a-short-guide-to-film-base-photographic-materials-identification,-care,-and-duplication|title=5.1 A Short Guide to Film Base Photographic Materials: Identification, Care, and Duplication|website=Northeast Document Conservation Center|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agents of deterioration ==

=== Temperature and humidity ===
The deterioration of both cellulose nitrate and cellulose acetate negatives is highly dependent on temperature and relative humidity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.1-a-short-guide-to-film-base-photographic-materials-identification,-care,-and-duplication|title=5.1 A Short Guide to Film Base Photographic Materials: Identification, Care, and Duplication|website=Northeast Document Conservation Center|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storing materials at room temperature or warmer, and with high humidity, will inevitably cause deterioration. Extreme fluctuations in temperature and relative humidity will rapidly increase the rate of deterioration.

=== Exposure to light ===
Permanent display of photographs is not recommended; most photographic materials are vulnerable in varying degrees to deterioration caused by light. Damage caused by light is cumulative and depends on the intensity, length of exposure, and the wavelength of the radiation. Visible light in blue part of the spectrum (400 to 500 nanometers), and ultraviolet (UV) radiation (300-to 400 nanometer region) are especially damaging. Sunlight and standard fluorescent light are both strong sources of UV. Color slides are particularly susceptible to fading when exposed to both visible and UV light.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/photolea.html|title=Information Leaflet on the Care, Handling, and Storage of Photographs - Collections Care - Resources {{!}}Preservation {{!}} Library of Congress|website=www.loc.gov|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pollution ===
Air pollution attacks photographs in the form of oxidant gases, particulate matter, acidic and sulfiding gases, and environmental fumes. Oxidant gases are composed primarily of pollution created by burning fossil fuels such as coal and oil. This can cause photographic images to fade. Particulate matter, such as soot and ash particles from manufacturing processes, exists in abundance outdoors and can enter the library or archives through heating and cooling ducts, doors, and windows. [[Particulates]], which may be greasy, abrasive, and chemically or biologically active, settle on shelves and on collection materials and create dust that is spread to other materials when they are handled. The by-products of combustion combined with moisture in the atmosphere pose another risk to photographic materials. These acids attack all components of photographs and cause silver images to fade and paper and board supports to discolor and become brittle. Environmental fumes can be especially damaging to photographic images even in small quantities.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Poor storage ===
Poor storage, such as lack of enclosures, can lead to deterioration through exposure to light and pollution. Additionally, materials that are not carefully and safely stored can rub against each other, causing scratching and abrasions. Storing film materials in basements, attics, or garages can cause rapid deterioration through extreme temperature and humidity fluctuations, but also through exposure to insects and rodents.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmpreservation.org/userfiles/image/PDFs/fpg_6.pdf|title=Improving Film Storage Conditions|last=|first=|date=2004|website=National Film Preservation Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storing materials on the floor can also increase the risk of damage by water leaks, insects and rodents.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Poor handling and use ===
Film can be mishandled causing physical damage. Working at dirty workstations or using bad rollers for motion picture film can cause dirt, scratches, and abrasions. Tears can occur when the film is stressed during winding or projection, in addition to improper threading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmpreservation.org/userfiles/image/PDFs/fpg_2.pdf|title=Understanding Film and How It Decays|last=|first=|date=2004|website=National Film Preservation Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repeated use, including the repeated insertion and removal of film from sleeves can also cause scratches and abrasions. Ignorance, neglect, and carelessness account for a significant percentage of damage to photographs.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Improper chemical processing ===
Major silver deterioration occurs when photographs are not correctly processed and washed. Over time, residual fixer left in the photograph causes the image, binder, and support to turn yellow or brown and the silver image to fade. High temperature and humidity speed this process. Photographs that were not well fixed remain light sensitive and may darken when exposed to light.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Nitrate deterioration ==
Cellulose nitrate is chemically unstable; decay is irreversible and autocatalytic. When the film deteriorates, it turns yellow, brittle and sticky. The off-gassing of nitrate produces hazardous and corrosive products (nitrogen oxides form nitric acid) along with an acrid smell that cause fading of the silver image, decomposition of the gelatin binder, and the eventual destruction of the plastic support and image material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These products (nitric acid, nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide) are destructive to other film-based negatives, and especially to photographic prints. Other artifacts, metals for instance, will be harmed by proximity to deteriorated nitrate material. Such gasses can cause skin, eye, and respiratory irritations. Allergic sensitivity has also been noted, as has dizziness and lightheadedness.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth/messier/negrmcc.html|title=Preserving Your Collection of Film-Based Photographic Negatives|last=Paul|first=Messier,|website=cool.conservation-us.org|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Nitrate Deterioration.jpg|thumb| A cellulose nitrate negative that has reached the later stages of deterioration; there is no image content remaining.]]

=== Types of deterioration ===

==== Embrittlement ====
Caused by the loss of elasticity in the plastic film base over time. The film can snap or break under strain, and will no longer have flexibility.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_embrittlement.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Shrinkage ====
The loss of the original dimensionality of the film and is irreversible.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_shrinkage.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Distortion ====
Distortion is caused by uneven shrinkage across a film's dimension and starts to warp or curl. This can be due to the difference in shrinkage between the film and emulsion layers, or areas of the film that start to shrink more than other areas. Temporary distortion can be reversed, but permanent distortion cannot.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_distortion.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gelatin and base decomposition ====
As the film is exposed to moisture, heat, and acids, nitrogen oxides are produced, which creates nitric acid. These promote silver corrosion and decompose the gelatin emulsion layer. The chemical reactions that occur cause further nitrate decay. Softness and stickiness occur and the image starts to fade away. This is irreversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_binder.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Silver mirroring and fading (black and white) ====
When exposed to moisture in the environment and various pollutants, the image silver will corrode, creating a reflective metallic sheen on the emulsion side. Typically starts at the edges of the film. Poor quality enclosures and storage can hasten the process.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_silvermirroring.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Redox blemishes ====
These small pink, orange or yellow spots can found in the image area and are often found in microfilm. These are created by local oxidation of metallic silver due to moisture and pollutants in the environment.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_redoxblemishes.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:N38 pre g 10 1 m.jpg|thumb|Deterioration of a cellulose nitrate negative that has adhered to its enclosure and degenerating.]]

=== Levels of deterioration ===
Deterioration of nitrate film is often categorized in six stages, or levels:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.1-a-short-guide-to-film-base-photographic-materials-identification,-care,-and-duplication|title=5.1 A Short Guide to Film Base Photographic Materials: Identification, Care, and Duplication|website=Northeast Document Conservation Center|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Level 1: No deterioration
* Level 2: The film turns yellow. The silver gelatin can begin to mirror
* Level 3: The film becomes sticky and emits a strong noxious odor (nitric acid)
* Level 4: The film becomes an amber color and the image starts to fade
* Level 5: The film is soft, can adhere to adjacent film, enclosures and other materials
* Level 6: The film degenerates into a brownish acid powder

== Acetate deterioration ==
While considered "safety film" as it produces less hazards than nitrate, cellulose acetate still faces stability issues. The deterioration of acetate is autocatalytic just like nitrate: once the deterioration process starts, the degradation products induce further deterioration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If not properly cared for and preserved, cellulose acetate will become acidic, and face many of the same issues that nitrate faces. Deteriorated acetate can also emit a noticeable odor, and can cause the same skin, eye, and respiratory irritations as nitrate does, in addition to dizziness and lightheadedness.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 

=== Types of deterioration ===
[[File:AD strips.jpg|thumb|AD strips used to monitor the level of acetic acid and negative degradation; testing the level of "vinegar syndrome"]]

==== Vinegar syndrome ====
Vinegar Syndrome is the release of acetic acid which produces a strong vinegary odor.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/imaging/ad-strips AD strips] are dye-coated paper strips that can detect and measure the severity of vinegar syndrome in film collections. The strips change color, shifting from a blue to green to level, based on the level of acidity found. If the AD strip level remains at blue, the film is in good condition and no deterioration is present. If the AD strip level turns yellow, the film condition is in critical condition, creating a possible handling hazard, and should be frozen immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org/imaging/ad-strips|title=Image Permanence Institute {{!}} A-D Strips|website=www.imagepermanenceinstitute.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Embrittlement ====
Caused by the loss of elasticity in the plastic film base over time. The film can snap or break under strain, and will no longer have flexibility.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Anti-halation ====
The acetic acid that is released in cellulose acetate negatives can trigger the retrieval of the color dyes in the backing layer, known as the anti-halation layer, giving the negative a blue or pink appearance. This is irreversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_antihalation.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Plasticizer exudation ====
Plasticizer additives that move to the surface of the film and form crystals or bubbles as the acetate film deteriorates. This is irreversible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_plasticizer_exudation.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shrinkage ====
The loss of the original dimensionality of the film and is irreversible.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Distortion ====
Distortion is caused by uneven shrinkage across a film's dimension and starts to warp or curl. This can be due to the difference in shrinkage between the film and emulsion layers, or areas of the film that start to shrink more than other areas. Temporary distortion can be reversed, but permanent distortion cannot.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;[[File:Acetate Deterioration.jpg|thumb|A cellulose acetate negative that is deteriorating; the gelatin layer is separating from the film support (channeling).]]

==== Channeling and delamination ====
As the film decays, acetic acid is released from the film support, which causes the gelatin layer to separate from the film support. This is a form of advanced acetate decay and can be accompanied by embrittlement and the exudation of plasticizers.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_delamination.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; While delamination is irreversible, skilled professionals can perform conservation treatments to save the image.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==== Dye fade (color) ====
Found in color films, dye fading reduces the overall density of the image resulting in loss of contrast and shifts in color balance. This is irreversible, however, digital restoration techniques can be used to approximate the original color balance and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmcare.org/vd_dyefade.php|title=FilmCare.org|website=filmcare.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Silver mirroring and fading (black and white) ====
When exposed to moisture in the environment and various pollutants, the image silver will corrode, creating a reflective metallic sheen on the emulsion side. Typically starts at the edges of the film. Poor quality enclosures and storage can hasten the process.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==== Redox blemishes ====
These small pink, orange or yellow spots can found in the image area and are often found in microfilm. These are created by local oxidation of metallic silver due to moisture and pollutants in the environment.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Levels of deterioration&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.1-a-short-guide-to-film-base-photographic-materials-identification,-care,-and-duplication|title=5.1 A Short Guide to Film Base Photographic Materials: Identification, Care, and Duplication|website=Northeast Document Conservation Center|language=en|access-date=2017-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Deterioration of cellulose acetate is often categorized into the following levels, or stages:

* Level 1: No deterioration 
* Level 2: Negatives start to curl and anti-halation colors released 
* Level 3: The onset of vinegar syndrome (vinegar odor) as well as shrinkage and brittleness. 
* Level 4: Warping 
* Level 5: Formation of bubbles and crystals 
* Level 6: Formation of channeling 

== Polyester deterioration ==
Because polyester is an inert and stable plastic, it does not possess the same deterioration concerns as celluloid films. Polyester can be stored at room temperature and does not need cold storage for preservation. Polyester is also used as an archival enclosure option for materials, such as [http://www.dictionary.com/browse/mylar Mylar] and Melinex brand products. 

=== Types of deterioration ===

==== Dye fade (color) ====
While polyester film is stable, the chromogenic dyes found in color negatives on polyester supports are not permanent and may fade rapidly at room temperature.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Preventive conservation strategies ==
Preventive conservation actions such as environmental monitoring, good storage, and promoting proper handling through staff and user education, will have a lasting, positive impact on the preservation of a collection.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;
[[File:Data Logger.jpg|thumb|Data logger used to monitor temperature and relative humidity]]

=== Temperature and humidity controls ===
Keeping film cold and dry is ideal; however, a cool environment (40 to 60 degrees) is better than room temperature or higher as it will slow down the deterioration process. The best storage conditions for both black &amp; white and color cellulose acetate film are cold (-15° to 4° C/ 5° to 39° F) and dry (30% to 40% relative humidity) environments for cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate films in both color and black and white, and color on polyester supports.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Black and white film on polyester supports may be stored at a temperature of 18º C (65º F) or lower and a relative humidity of 30% to 40%.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[File:Cold Storage Cabinets.jpg|thumb|An example of storage cabinets within a large walk-in freezer for cold storage of celluloid film.]]

=== Cold storage ===
Freezing film is the ideal temperature to preserve film for the long-term. At freezing temperatures, the natural decomposition of cellulose nitrate and acetate is slowed down. Cold storage is predicted to extend the life of acetate negatives by a factor of ten or more.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Storage control ===
Three layers of protection are recommended for the storage of film base photographic materials.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Negatives and positives should be placed in sleeves or envelopes, which are then placed in a box or drawer, and these boxes or drawers on shelves or in a cabinet. Motion picture film and microfilm should be stored in unsealed containers in cabinets or on shelves.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Labels such as acid-free, lignin-free, or buffered do not guarantee that a material is safe to use with photographic materials. Chemically inert papers may be harmful to the photographic image; the only way to be certain of the stability of the paper is to purchase materials that have passed the Photographic Activity Test (PAT).&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/5.-photographs/5.6-storage-enclosures-for-photographic-materials|title=5.6 Storage Enclosures for Photographic Materials|website=Northeast Document Conservation Center|language=en|access-date=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also considerations to be made regarding paper or plastic enclosures. Factors such as use, handling, and cost should be considered when selecting archival storage materials.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; There are several resources provided in the external links section below that can assist with the selection of proper storage materials for photographic materials. 

Film materials should be stored in interior rooms away from exterior walls and places that do not have extreme temperature fluctuations. Furthermore, film materials should not be stored near sources of heat (sunlight, radiators, heaters), water (bathrooms, sprinklers), or near chemical or exhaust fumes.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Storage environments should be regularly monitored to check temperature and humidity controls, HVAC systems, and pest-free.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Quantities of nitrate film in excess of 25 pounds are subject to storage and handling standards prescribed by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/film.html|title=Care, Handling, and Storage of Motion Picture Film - Collections Care (Preservation, Library of Congress)|website=www.loc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Seriously deteriorated negatives of any type should be isolated from those in good condition.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Light control ===
Photographic materials should always be covered when not in use. Storing film-based materials in containers and boxes will keep light away from the materials. When exhibiting or using these materials, a low light level should be used. The installation of low-UV-emitting bulbs or UV-absorbing fluorescent bulb sleeves can help eliminate this problem. UV filtering window glazing or the installation of window shades may also help. Low- UV-emitting bulbs and sleeves are available from several manufacturers. Light levels in storage areas can also be controlled by the use of timed shut-off switches. Dark cloths or sheets of folder stock (heavyweight paper) or mat board should be available in reading rooms for covering objects when not in use by readers.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Pollution control ===
Air entering the storage area should be filtered and purified to remove particulate and gaseous matter. A well-designed filtration system includes cellulose or fiberglass filters that remove particulate matter, and chemical absorption system that filters out gaseous pollutants. Air filters must be changed regularly to be effective. Air circulation should also be checked periodically.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Handling control ===
When handling film, the user should always have clean hands and wear gloves (cotton or nitrile) to avoid fingerprints or scratches. Always handle the film by the edge to avoid touching the image surface.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Users must be careful when removing film from enclosures to avoid scratches or abrasions. Never force rolled film flat if it is brittle, as it can snap or break. Always work in an uncluttered and clean environment that is well-lit and ventilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmpreservation.org/userfiles/image/PDFs/fpg_3.pdf|title=Film Handling and Inspection|last=|first=|date=2004|website=National Film Preservation Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   It's also beneficial to avoid wearing jewelry, such as long necklaces, that can accidentally scratch the film when being examined. Food and drinks should be kept in a separate room or a safe distance from the film materials. It is also advisable to limit exposure times to celluloid film, wear googles and a respirator.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 

=== Digitization ===
Any negatives that show signs of deterioration should be digitized as soon as possible. Without immediate restoration followed by a change to proper long-term storage, the environmental factors that caused the early signs of damage will continue, leading eventually to irreparable damage and permanent loss of the film’s content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://protekvaults.com/nitrate-and-acetate-film-restoration/|title=Nitrate and acetate film restoration: Is it too late for your film to be restored? (PRO-TEK Vaults Blog)|access-date=2017-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrate and safety negatives that need to be handled but are in good condition should still generally be digitized. The digital image can then be used as an access copy while the original remains in cold storage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A wide array of digital systems are available for capturing and storing photographic images, and an institution should have a digital preservation policy in place. Digitization requires active management to ensure the digitized copies are not corrupted or lost. There are many factors to consider when digitizing photographic materials.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The Northeast Document Conservation Center provides information and resources on [https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/digital-preservation Digital Preservation].

=== Duplication ===
Transferring negatives to a more stable support such as polyester is the best way to preserve the longevity of the images.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Conservation treatments ==
Deteriorated film that requires conservation work should be conducted by a photograph conservator. There are several resources available to aid in finding a conservator for your needs, including the [http://www.conservation-us.org/membership/find-a-conservator#.WNVocG8rK70 American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC)], the [https://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/7.-conservation-procedures/7.7-choosing-and-working-with-a-conservator Northeast Document Conservation Center (NEDCC)], and the [http://www.ccaha.org/publications/consultant-specialist-database Conservation Center for Art and Historic Artifacts (CCAHA)].

=== Conservation treatments for nitrate ===
It is not recommended to perform conservation treatments on nitrate. The best options are cold storage to prevent further deterioration (especially if the film is found to be in the lower levels of deterioration), digitize the nitrate film, or duplicate the nitrate film onto a more stable support like polyester. If the nitrate is found to be at the higher levels of deterioration, it is recommended that the original nitrate film be destroyed due to the health and safety hazards.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 

=== Conservation treatments for acetate ===
Cold storage is the best option for preventive conservation of cellulose acetate film as it slows down the deterioration process. As with nitrate, it is also suggested that digitization and duplication efforts are useful in providing access copies. However, it is possible to perform some conservation treatments on acetate film. 

"Stripping" is a technique that is used by trained conservators on channeled acetate film. This process allows the conservator to separate the gelatin emulsion layer from the deteriorating acetate film base in a bath and then reattach or duplicate the gelatin emulsion layer onto another sheet of film. This process is quite tedious and expensive, and not always successful, therefore it is not always a viable option for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gawainweaver.com/images/uploads/Horvath_AcetateNegativeSurvey.pdf|title=The Acetate Negative Survey|last=Horvath|first=David G.|date=1987|website=Gawain Weaver Art Conservation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Obstacles in conservation and restoration ==

=== Irreversible damage or deterioration ===
As described above, celluloid materials are chemically unstable and will naturally deteriorate over time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Once the materials have reached high levels of deterioration, the film often faces irreversible damage, including image loss. It's important to digitize or duplicate these materials before they face irreversible damage.

=== Cost ===
Cold storage (freezers) can be costly and prohibitive for many institutions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Digitization can also be costly; factors that need to be considered are size and use of collection, space available for storage, and financial resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

Deteriorated photographs may require specialized conservation treatment by a professional photograph conservator, often a costly, skill-demanding, and time-consuming procedure. For the majority of photographs in research collections, single-item conservation of deteriorated photographs is probably not a feasible or a cost-effective preservation solution.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Access ===
Cold storage can be prohibitive for access due to the acclimation periods required to use the film.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5951">A '''control loop''' is the fundamental building block of [[industrial control system]]s. It consists of all the physical components and control functions necessary to automatically adjust the value of a measured process variable (PV) to equal the value of a desired set-point (SP). It includes the process sensor, the controller function, and the final control element (FCE) which are all required for automatic control.

==Application==
[[File:Industrial control loop.jpg|thumb|300px|Example of a single industrial control loop; showing continuously modulated control of process flow.]]
The accompanying diagram shows a control loop with a single PV input, a control function, and the control output (CO) which modulates the action of the final control element (FCE) to alter the value of the manipulated variable (MV). In this example, a flow control loop is shown, but can be level, temperature, or any one of many process parameters which need to be controlled. The control function shown is an "intermediate type" such as a [[PID controller]] which means it can generate a full range of output signals anywhere between 0-100%, rather than just an on/off signal.  
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cooper|first1=Douglas|title=Control Guru|url=http://controlguru.com/the-components-of-a-control-loop/|website=Control Guru terminology|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this example the value of the PV is always the same as the MV, as they are in series in the pipeline. However, if the feed from the valve was to a tank, and the controller function was to control level using the fill valve, the PV would be the tank level, and the MV would be the flow to the tank.

The controller function can be a discrete controller, or a function block in a computerised control system such as a distributed control system or a [[programmable logic controller]]. In all cases, a control loop diagram is a very convenient and useful way of representing the control function and its interaction with plant. In practice at a process control level, the control loops are normally abbreviated using standard symbols in a [[Piping and instrumentation diagram]], which shows all elements of the process measurement and control based on a [[process flow diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piping and instrumentation diagram P&amp;ID|url=http://processflowsystems.com/piping-instrumentation-diagram-pid/|website=Process Flow Systems|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a detailed level the control loop connection diagram is created to show the electrical and pneumatic connections. This greatly aids diagnostics and repair, as all the connections for a single control function are on one diagram.

==Loop and control equipment tagging==
To aid unique identification of equipment, each loop and its elements are identified by a "tagging" system and each element has a unique tag identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Components of control loops and ISA symbology|url=http://www.pacontrol.com/download/Process%20Control%20Fundamentals.pdf|website=Instrumentation and control  - process control fundamentals.|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the standards [[ANSI]]/[[Instrument Society of America|ISA]] S5.1 and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 14617-6, the identifications consist of up to 5 letters.

The first identification letter is for the measured value, the second is a modifier, 3rd indicates passive/readout function, 4th - active/output function, and the 5th is the function modifier. This is followed by loop number, which is unique to that loop.

For instance FIC045 means it is the Flow Indicating Controller in control loop 045. This is also known as the "tag" identifier of the field device, which is normally given to the location and function of the instrument. The same loop may have FT045 - which is the flow transmitter in the same loop.

In [[classical scholarship]], the '''''editio princeps''''' ([[plural]]: ''editiones principes'') of a work is the first printed edition of the work, that previously had existed only in [[manuscript]]s, which could be circulated only after being copied by hand.

For example, the ''editio princeps'' of [[Homer]] is that of [[Demetrius Chalcondyles]], now thought to be from 1488. The most important texts of classical Greek and Roman authors were for the most part produced in ''editiones principes'' in the years on either side of 1500, following the invention of the [[printing press]] around 1440.&lt;ref name=Needham&gt;{{cite book |title=Paper and Printing |author=[[Tsien Tsuen-Hsuin]] |author2=[[Joseph Needham]] |series=Science and Civilisation in China|volume=5 part 1|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=158,201|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Briggs&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp.15–23, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases there were possibilities of partial publication, of publication first in translation (for example from Greek to Latin), and of a usage that simply equates with [[first edition]]. For a work with several strands of manuscript tradition that have diverged, such as ''[[Piers Plowman]]'', ''editio princeps'' is a less meaningful concept.

The term has long been extended by scholars to works not part of the Ancient Greek and Latin literatures. It is also used for legal works, and other significant documents.

These were increased to 236 letters in nine books with the publication of the Roman edition in 1490. Still missing was the tenth book, found by [[Giovanni Giocondo]] between 1495 and 1500 in the [[Abbey of St. Victor, Paris|Abbey of St. Victor]] near Paris. Giocondo made a transcription, as did briefly after another Italian, Pietro Leandro, who once returned from France gave his partial copy of the tenth book to Girolamo Avanzi who printed the new 46 letters in [[Verona]] in 1502. For an edition of all Pliny's letters it was necessary to wait 1508, when [[Aldus Manutius]] printed in Venice a complete edition taking advantage of the transcript and other Plinian manuscripts Giocondo had given him.&lt;ref name="MVA1155"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GGNV"&gt;{{it icon}} P.

Also in the edition is [[Publilius Syrus]], whose ''Sententiae'' are in the so-called ''Proverbia Senecae''. The mistake was corrected in 1514 by [[Erasmus]] when the latter published in [[Southwark]] in 1514 an edition of Publilius that is generally considered to be the real ''editio princeps''. Erasmus was followed in [[Leipzig]] in 1550 by [[Georg Fabricius]], who also added twenty new sentences to the print.&lt;ref name="RA338"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AG874"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. A. H.

|rowspan=5|Edited by [[Demetrios Chalkokondyles|Demetrius Chalcondyles]], the book was printed with the help of {{Interlanguage link multi|Demetrius Damilas|el|3=Δημήτριος Δαμιλάς}} that reelaborated the Greek types he had previously used in Milan. The editorial project was completed thanks to the financial support of [[Giovanni Acciaiuoli]] and the patronage of Neri and [[Bernardo de' Nerli]] ([[:it:Nerli|it]]) together with, the latter also author of an opening dedication to [[Piero the Unfortunate|Piero de' Medici]]. The edition included not only the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', but also the so-called ''Homeric Hymns'', the ''Batrachomyomachia'' and passages on Homer from works attributed to [[Plutarch]], [[Herodotus]] and [[Dio Chrysostom|Dio Cocceianus]]. As for the typography the volume has traditionally been attributed to the prolific printer Bartolomeo de' Libri, attribution denied by recent scholarship. The issue thus remains unresolved.&lt;ref name="calcondila"/&gt;&lt;ref name="de' libri"&gt;{{it icon}} A.

|This edition contains only 6 of Aeschylus' 7 surviving tragedies: missing is the ''Choephoroe''. This is because the manuscripts had fused ''Agamemnon'' and ''Choephoroe'', omitting lines 311-1066 of ''Agamemnon'', a mistake that was corrected for the first time in 1552 in the Venetian edition edited by [[Francesco Robortello|Franciscus Robortellus]]. The separation was not fully successful as the text was not correctly divided, leaving it to the 1557 Paris edition by [[Petrus Victorius]], printed with an appendix by Henricus Stephanus, to finally obtain an adequate edition of Aeschylus' plays.&lt;ref name="JL98-121"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grafton10-411"&gt;A.

|A part of Book VI had been already printed in Venice in 1529 by Joannes Antonius de Sabio, edited by [[Janus Lascaris]] with his Latin translation incorporated. The 1530 edition, edited by [[Vincentius Opsopoeus]], only contained Books I–V together with their Latin translation made by [[Niccolò Perotti|Nicolaus Perottus]]. What survived of the rest of Polybius thanks to the ''excerpta antiqua'' of the other Books was first printed by Joannes Hervagius in Basel in 1549 together with a Latin translation by Wolfgang Musculus. Further Polybian excerpts came to light thanks to [[Fulvio Orsini|Fulvius Ursinus]] that in Antwerp in 1582 published [[Constantine VII|Constantinus Porphyrogenitus]]' ''Excerpta de legationibus''. All this additional material was incorporated in [[Isaac Casaubon]]'s 1609 Polybius Paris edition.&lt;ref name="catalogus7-171"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

The '''Electronic Information Exchange System''' ('''EIES''', pronounced ''[[eye]]s'') was an early [[online conferencing]] [[bulletin board system]] that allowed [[Real-time computing|real-time]] and [[asynchronous communication]]. The system was used to deliver courses, conduct conferencing sessions, and facilitate research. Funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] and developed from 1974-1978 at the [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] (NJIT) by [[Murray Turoff]] based on his earlier EMISARI done at the now-defunct [[Office of Emergency Preparedness]], EIES was intended to facilitate group communications that would allow groups to make decisions based on their [[collective intelligence]] rather than the [[lowest common denominator]]. Initially conceived as an experiment in [[computer mediated communication]], EIES remained in use for decades because its users "just wouldn't let go" of it, eventually adapting it for legislative, medical and even spiritual uses.

==Technology==
In the mid-1980s, a new version called ''EIES-2'' was developed to research the implementation of group communications in distributed environments, versus the centralized [[time-sharing]] environment used for the first version. EIES-2 had an [[object database]] architecture using over 2 dozen classes and implementing a notion of ''activities'', which was a standardized interface for implementing nonstandard functions such as polls or list-gathering. The activities concept was similar to what would be done in today's [[message board]] applications using [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]]. The standard message-based functions were also implemented as activities. EIES-2 ran on [[Unix]] and was written in the programming languages [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Smalltalk]]. EIES-2 used the [[X.400]] database standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.njit.edu/~turoff/Administrative/ccc.htm|title=An Overview of research activities in Computer Mediated Communications from 1976 to 1991 conducted by the Computerized Conferencing and Communications Center at NJIT by Murray Turoff and Starr Roxanne Hiltz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accounts were available to the public for a monthly fee of USD $75 plus connect-time charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_1984_Point/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_1984_Point_djvu.txt|title=WESC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
In his book [[The Virtual Community]], [[Howard Rheingold]] called EIES "the lively great-great-grandmother of all virtual communities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.well.com/user/hlr/vcbook/vcbook4.html|title=The Virtual Community}}&lt;/ref&gt; EIES was one of the earliest instances of [[groupware]], if not the earliest, and some users contend it is where the term was coined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meatballwiki.org/wiki/GroupWare|title=GroupWare}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editors of the [[Whole Earth Software Catalog]] set up a private conference on EIES where they could collaborate on software reviews from around the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SNFpgX_WigC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131|title=From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with serious research, there were diversions like the "EIES Soap Opera", which was a series of stories written collaboratively by the service's users. The first soap opera was initiated in 1980 by [[Martin Nisenholtz]].&lt;ref name="ChangeLife"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atariarchives.org/deli/computer_networking.php|title=Computer Networking Can Change Your Life|quote=My worklife, homelife and communications life melded together.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working groups from different corporations used EIES to collaborate, some working exclusively from home. EIES gave an early glimpse of the challenges of [[work–life balance]]&lt;ref name="ChangeLife" /&gt; and pointed the way toward [[hypertext]] and [[gamification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.njit.edu/~turoff/Administrative/ccc.htm|title=An Overview of research activities in Computer Mediated Communications from 1976 to 1991 conducted by the Computerized Conferencing and Communications Center at NJIT by Murray Turoff and Starr Roxanne Hiltz|quote=Gaming takes on a new dimension when it is possible for players in the game to participate asynchronously and it also becomes possible to replicate realistic communication constraints. We have explored and documented the benefits of this type of gaming in the management educational environment. Further work will be oriented, not only towards education, but also towards the possibility of gaming as a decision analysis tool.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable users included [[Alvin Toffler]], Peter &amp; Trudy Johnson-Lenz, [[Barry Wellman]], and Whole Earth editor-in-chief [[Stewart Brand]], who was influenced by EIES to develop [[The WELL]]. At its peak EIES had more than 2000 subscribers from various government agencies, large corporations and educational institutions. The [[Western Behavioral Sciences Institute]] ran a private conference called the ''School of Management and Strategic Studies'', of which [[Harlan Cleveland]] was a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_1984_Point/Whole_Earth_Software_Catalog_1984_Point_djvu.txt|title=WESC}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a [[legacy system]] lacking support for [[multimedia]] or [[Email attachment|file attachments]], EIES was shut down in 2000, despite NJIT's inability to locate a replacement with equivalent performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eies.njit.edu/vc.phaseout.html |title=EIES/VC Phaseout |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020802212954/http://eies.njit.edu/vc.phaseout.html |archivedate=August 2, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its shutdown, EIES-2 held 6 GB of stored data, and could serve 1,000 concurrent users with an average response time of under 15 seconds.

'''Ernst Karl Abbe''' [[FRMS|HonFRMS]] (23 January 1840 – 14 January 1905) was a [[Germany|German]] [[physicist]], [[optical engineering|optical scientist]], [[entrepreneur]], and social reformer. Together with [[Otto Schott]] and [[Carl Zeiss]], he laid the foundation of modern [[optics]]. Abbe developed numerous optical instruments. He was a co-owner of [[Carl Zeiss AG]], a German manufacturer of research microscopes, astronomical telescopes, planetariums and other optical systems.

== Personal life ==
[[File:Else Abbe.png|thumb|left|Else Snell]]
Abbe was born 23 January 1840 in [[Eisenach]], [[Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]],&lt;ref name="NDB"&gt;{{harvnb|Blasius|1953|pp=2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Georg Adam Abbe and Elisabeth Christina Barchfeldt.&lt;ref name=wws&gt;{{harvnb|Debus|Calinger|Collins|Kennedy|1968|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came from a humble home — his father was a foreman in a spinnery. Supported by his father's employer, Abbe was able to attend secondary school and to obtain the general qualification for university entrance with fairly good grades, at the Eisenach Gymnasium, which he graduated from in 1857.&lt;ref name =gu/&gt; By the time he left school, his scientific talent and his strong will had already become obvious. Thus, in spite of the family's strained financial situation, his father decided to support Abbe's studies at the Universities of [[University of Jena|Jena]] (1857–1859) and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] (1859–1861).&lt;ref name="NDB"/&gt; During his time as a student, Abbe gave private lessons to improve his income. His father's employer continued to fund him. Abbe was awarded his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Göttingen on 23 March 1861.&lt;ref name=gu&gt;{{harvnb|Günther|1970|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at school, he was influenced by [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber]], who also happened to be one of the [[Göttingen Seven]].&lt;ref name=gu2&gt;{{harvnb|Günther|1970|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by two short assignments at the Göttingen [[observatory]] and at Physikalischer Verein in [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] (an association of citizens interested in physics and chemistry that was founded by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] in 1824 and still exists today).&lt;ref name=gu2/&gt; On 8 August 1863 he qualified as a university lecturer at the University of Jena. In 1870, he accepted a contract as an associate [[professor]] of experimental [[physics]], [[mechanics]] and [[mathematics]] in Jena.&lt;ref name="NDB"/&gt;&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{harvnb|Hoiberg|2010|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, he married Else Snell, daughter of the mathematician and physicist Karl Snell, one of Abbe's teachers,{{refn|group=nb|Some sources give his wife's name as Elisabeth.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt;}} with whom he had two daughters.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; He attained full professor status by 1879.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; He became director of the [[Jena Observatory|Jena astronomical and meteorological observatory]] in 1878.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt;{{refn|group=nb|The dates of his job appointments at the University of Jena, including his appointment as director of the Jena Observatory has some uncertainty, as sources give different dates, as following. 1870: assistant lecturer on mechanics and experimental physics; 1873: associate professor; 1877: director of the Jena Observatory meteorological and astronomy departments.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt;}} In 1889, he became a member of the [[Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities]]. He also was a member of the Saxon Academy of Sciences. He was relieved of his teaching duties at the University of Jena in 1891. Abbe died 14 January 1905 in Jena.&lt;ref name="NDB"/&gt; He was an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph McCabe (1945). A Biographical Dictionary of Ancient, Medieval, and Modern Freethinkers. Haldeman-Julius Publications. Retrieved 7 April 2013. He was not only a distinguished German physicist and one of the most famous inventors on the staff at the Zeiss optical works at Jena but a notable social reformer, By a generous scheme of profit-sharing he virtually handed over the great Zeiss enterprise to the workers. Abbe was an intimate friend of Haeckel and shared his atheism (or Monism). Leonard Abbot says in his life of Ferrer that Abbe had "just the same ideas and aims as Ferrer."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abbe-Grab kl.jpg|thumb|upright|Ernst Abbe, relief at his grave]]In 1866, he became a research director at the [[Carl Zeiss AG|Zeiss Optical Works]], and in 1886 he invented the [[Apochromat|apochromatic lens]], a microscope lens which eliminates both the primary and secondary color distortion.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; By 1870, Abbe invented the [[Abbe condenser]], used for microscope illumination.&lt;ref name =EB/&gt; In 1871, he designed the first [[refractometer]], which he described in a booklet published in 1874.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abbe|1874}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He developed the laws of image of non-luminous objects by 1872.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; Zeiss Optical Works began selling his improved microscopes in 1872, by 1877 they were selling microscopes with homogenous immersion objective, and in 1886 his apochromatic objective microscopes were being sold.&lt;ref name=pf&gt;{{harvnb|Pfeiffer|1991|p=445}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created the [[Abbe number]], a measure of any [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] material's variation of [[refractive index]] with [[wavelength]] and Abbe's criterion, which tests the hypothesis, that a systematic trend exists in a set of observations (in terms of resolving power this criterion stipulates that an angular separation cannot be less than the ratio of the wavelength to the aperture diameter, see [[angular resolution]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Joint Committee of Civil Engineers, American Congress on Surveying and Mapping, and American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; Already a professor in [[Jena]], he was hired by [[Carl Zeiss]] to improve the manufacturing process of optical instruments, which back then was largely based on trial and error.

Abbe was the first to define the term [[numerical aperture]],&lt;ref name="NA Est"&gt;{{harvnb|Abbe|1881}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the sine of the half angle multiplied by the refractive index of the medium filling the space between the cover glass and front lens.

Abbe is credited by many for discovering the resolution limit of the microscope, and the formula (published in 1873)

{{NumBlk|::|&lt;math&gt;d = \frac{\lambda}{2 NA}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|Eq. 1}}}}

although in a publication in 1874 by [[Helmholtz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Helmholtz|Fripp|1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; (another early appearance of this formula), [[Helmholtz]] states this formula was first derived by [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]], who had died 61 years prior. Helmholtz was so impressed as to offer a professorship at the [[University of Berlin]], which he refused due to his ties to Zeiss.&lt;ref name=gu2/&gt; Abbe was in the camp of the wide aperturists, arguing that microscopic resolution is ultimately limited by the aperture of the optics, but also argued that depending on application there are other parameters that should be weighted over the aperture in the design of objectives. In Abbe's 1874 paper, titled "A Contribution to the Theory of the Microscope and the nature of Microscopic Vision",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abbe|1876}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbe states that the resolution of a microscope is inversely dependent on its aperture, but without proposing a formula for the resolution limit of a microscope.

In 1876, Abbe was offered a partnership by Zeiss and began to share in the considerable profits.&lt;ref name=gu2/&gt; Although the first theoretical derivations of {{EquationNote|Eq. 1}} were published by others, it is fair to say that Abbe was the first to reach this conclusion experimentally. In 1878, he built the first homogenous immersion system for the microscope.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; The objectives that the Abbe Zeiss collaboration were producing were of ideal ray geometry, allowing Abbe to find that the aperture sets the upper limit of microscopic resolution, not the curvature and placement of the lenses. Abbe's first publication of {{EquationNote|Eq. 1}} occurred in 1882.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abbe|1883}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this publication, Abbe states that both his theoretical and experimental investigations confirmed {{EquationNote|Eq. 1}}. Abbe's contemporary Henry Edward Fripp, English translator of Abbe's and Helmholtz's papers, puts their contributions on equal footing. He also perfected the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference method]] by [[Fizeau]], in 1884.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; Abbe, Zeiss, Zeiss' son, [[Roderich Zeiss]], and [[Otto Schott]] formed, in 1884, [[Schott AG|Jenaer Glaswerk Schott &amp; Genossen]]. This company, which in time would in essence merge with Zeiss Optical Works, was responsible for research and production of 44 initial types of optical glass.&lt;ref name=pf/&gt; Working with [[telescope]]s, he built image reversal system in 1895.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt;

In                                     order to produce high quality objectives, Abbe made significant contributions to the diagnosis and correction of [[optical aberration]]s, both [[spherical aberration]] and [[coma aberration]], which is required for an objective to reach the resolution limit of {{EquationNote|Eq. 1}}. In addition to spherical aberration, Abbe discovered that the rays in optical systems must have constant angular magnification over their angular distribution to produce a diffraction limited spot, a principle known as the [[Abbe sine condition]].&lt;ref name="NA Est"/&gt; So monumental and advanced were Abbe's calculations and achievements that [[Frits Zernike]] based his [[Phase contrast microscopy|phase contrast]] work on them, for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1953, and [[Hans Busch (physicist)|Hans Busch]] used them to work on the development of the [[electron microscope]].&lt;ref name=gu2/&gt;

During his association with [[Carl Zeiss]]' [[microscope]] works, not only was he at the forefront of the field of optics but also labor reform as he also, in 1900, introduced the [[Eight hour day|eight-hour workday]], in remembrance of the 14-hour workday of his own father.&lt;ref name=pf/&gt; In addition, he created a pension fund and a discharge compensation fund.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; In 1889, Ernst Abbe set up and endowed the [[Carl Zeiss Foundation]] for research in science.&lt;ref name=wws/&gt; The aim of the foundation was "to secure the economic, scientific, and technological future and in this way to improve the job security of their employees."&lt;ref name=pf/&gt; He made it a point that the success of an employee was based solely on their ability and performance, not on their origin, religion, or political views.&lt;ref name=pf/&gt; In 1896, he reorganized the Zeiss optical works into a cooperative with profit-sharing.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; His social views were so respected as to be used by the [[Prussia]]n state as a model and idealized by [[Alfred Weber]] in the 1947 book ''Schriften der Heidelberger Aktionsgruppe zur Demokratie und Zum Freien Sozialismus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Günther|1970|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crater [[Abbe (crater)|Abbe]] on the [[Moon]] was named in his honour.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

An '''explanandum''' (a [[Latin]] term) is a sentence describing a [[phenomenon]] that is to be [[explanation|explained]], and the '''explanans''' are the sentences adduced as explanations of that phenomenon. For example, one person may pose an ''explanandum'' by asking "Why is there smoke?", and another may provide an ''explanans'' by responding "Because there is a fire". In this example, "smoke" is the ''explanandum'', and "fire" is the ''explanans''.

==In scientific method==
[[Carl Gustav Hempel]] and [[Paul Oppenheim]] (1948),&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Hempel CG, Oppenheim P |year=1948 |title=Studies in the Logic of Explanation |journal=Philosophy of Science |volume=XV |pages=135–175 |doi=10.1086/286983|citeseerx=10.1.1.294.3693 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in their [[deductive-nomological model]] of scientific explanation, motivated the distinction between explanans and explanandum in order to answer why-questions, rather than simply what-questions:

{{Quotation|"the event under discussion is explained by subsuming it under general laws, i.e., by showing that it occurred in accordance with those laws, by virtue of the realization of certain specified antecedent conditions"|Hempel &amp; Oppenheim, 1948|(p.152)&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"/&gt;}}

Specifically, they define the concepts as follows:

{{Quotation|"By the ''explanandum'', we understand the sentence describing the phenomenon to be explained (not that phenomenon itself); by the ''explanans'', the class of those sentences which are adduced to account for the phenomenon"|Hempel &amp; Oppenheim, 1948|(p.152)&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"/&gt;}}

The crucial comment, with respect to the scientific method, is given as follows:

{{Quotation|"It may be said... that an explanation is not fully adequate unless its explanans, if taken account of in time, could have served as a basis for predicting the phenomenon under consideration....  It is this potential predictive force which gives scientific explanation its importance: Only to the extent that we are able to explain empirical facts can we attain the major objective of scientific research, namely not merely to record the phenomena of our experience, but to learn from them, by basing upon them theoretical generalizations which enable us to anticipate new occurrences and to control, at least to some extent, the changes in our environment"|Hempel &amp; Oppenheim, 1948|(p.154)&lt;ref name="HempelOppenheim1948"/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8621">The idea and practice of '''explication''' is rooted in the verb [[wiktionary:explicate|to explicate]], which concerns the process of "unfolding" and of "making clear" the meaning of things, so as to make the implicit explicit. The expression "explication" is used in both [[analytic philosophy]] and literary theory.

== Carnap's notion of explication ==

=== Summary ===

Explication can be regarded as a scientific process which transforms and replaces "an inexact prescientific concept" (which [[Carnap]] calls the explicandum), with a "new exact concept" (which he calls the explicatum). An extended document, like an essay or thesis which describes and explains the new explicit knowledge, is usually called an "Explication".  But an explication may also be contained and expressed in shorter formats, such as in paragraphs and sentences, which are deliberately drafted to emphasise the nature and impact of new explicit knowledge which draws on, and are improvements upon, previous knowledge.

=== On explication and truth ===

An explication in the Carnapian sense is purely stipulative, and thus a subclass of normative definitions. Hence, an explication can not be true or false, just more or less suitable for its purpose. (Cf. Rorty's argument about the purpose and value of philosophy in Rorty, (2003), “A pragmatist view of contemporary analytic philosophy”, in Egginton, W. and Sandbothe, M. (Eds), The Pragmatic Turn in Philosophy, Suny Press, New York, NY.)

Examples of inexact daily life concepts in need of explication are our concepts of cause and of conditionals. Our daily life concept of cause does not distinguish between necessary causes, sufficient causes, complete causes etc. Each of these more precise concepts is an explication of our natural concept of cause.

Natural language will only specify [[truth conditions]] for propositions of the form "If p, then q" for situations where "p" is true. (Most of us probably don't have any clear intuitions regarding the truth conditions of the sentence "If I go out in the sun, I will get sunburned" in situations where I never go out in the sun.) An explication of the conditional will also specify truth conditions for situations where "p" is not true.

=== Reviews of Carnap's argument ===
Carnap's argument provides a helpful foundation in understanding and clarifying the nature and value of explication in defining and describing "new" knowledge.

Others' reviews of Carnap's argument offer additional insights about the nature of explication.  In particular, Bonolio's paper (2003) "Kant’s Explication and Carnap’s Explication: The Redde Rationem", and Maher's (2007) "Explication defended", add weight to the argument that explication is an appropriate methodology for formal philosophy.

== Explication as a process versus explication as an outcome ==
When working with explication, it is essential to be clear, and to make clear whether you are dealing with the explication ''process'' (and hence working with the verb or gerund), or dealing with the ''outcomes'' of the process, such as a work which documents, describes and explains the new explicit knowledge.

== Explication as an interpretative process ==
Based on the etymology of the word explication, studies using explication, and extended argumentation we can deduce that explication in the arts, humanities and social sciences is largely an ''interpretative'' process where the outcomes - the new explicit knowledge - is open to subsequent dispute, with the possibility of additional and/or different meanings being derived in the future.

On this argument, new explicit knowledge is therefore contingent and context specific.  New explicit knowledge is also informed by the explicant's competence in dealing with the explication process, plus an ethical concern that the outcomes (i.e. the new explicit knowledge) can be considered to be an improvement and "true" (i.e.  not yet disaffirmed). (cf. Harrison, 2006).

== Semantic explication ==
In the [[Natural semantic metalanguage]] theory, explications are semantic representations of vocabulary. These explications are made up of a very limited set of words called [[semantic primes]] which are considered to have universal meaning across all languages.

An example of an explication of the word ''happy''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lexical Meaning|last=Murphy|first=M. Lynne|publisher=Cambridge Textbooks in Linguistics|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=69–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;'':''&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
X feels happy = 
     sometimes someone thinks something like this:
          something good happened to something
          I wanted this
          I don't want other things now
     because of this, someone feels something good
     X feels like this
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;What sets the Natural Semantic Metalanguage Theory's explications apart from previous theories, is that these explications can fit into natural language, even if it sounds very awkward. For example:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
The clown looks [happy]

The clown looks like [the clown thinks something like this: 'something good happened to me; I wanted this; I don't want other things now'; because of this, the clown feels something good].
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;Explications in the Natural Semantic Metalanguage are neither exact dictionary definitions, nor encyclopedic explanations of a concept. They often differ slightly depending upon the personal experiences of the person writing them. In this way, they can be said to "rely heavily on 'folk theories,' that is, the rather naive understandings that most of us have about how life, the universe, and everything work."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Explications of abstract concepts, such as color, do not list any scientific facts about the object or concrete definitions. Instead, the explications use comparisons and examples from the real world.

== Explication, explication de texte, and literary criticism ==

The terms 'Explication' and 'Explication de texte' have different meanings.

As argued by Carnap (1950), in science and philosophy, 
"explication consists in transforming a given more or less inexact concept into an exact one or, rather, in replacing the first by the second. We call the given concept (or the term used for it) the explicandum, and the exact concept proposed to take the place of the first (or the term proposed for it) the explicatum. The explicandum may belong to everyday language or to a previous stage in the development of scientific language. The explicatum must be given by explicit rules for its use, for example, by a definition which incorporates it into a well-constructed system of scientific either logicomathematical or empirical concepts."

In this context, 'explication' is now regarded as "an appropriate methodology for formal philosophy". (Maher, 2007).

By contrast, in [[literary criticism]], the term 'explication' is used as a proxy for the term ''[[explication de texte]]'', where additional understandings and meanings are derived from the "[[close reading]]" of (say) a poem, novel or play.

In this process, explication often involves a line-by-line or episode-by-episode commentary on what is going on in a text. While initially this might seem reasonably innocuous, ''[[explication de texte]]'', and explication per se, is an interpretative process where the resulting new knowledge, new insights or new meanings, are open to subsequent debate and disaffirmation by others.

In [[paleontology]], a '''fern spike''' is the occurrence of abundant [[fern]] [[spore]]s in the [[fossil record]], usually immediately (in a [[Geologic time scale|geological]] sense) after an [[extinction event]].  The spikes are believed to represent a large, temporary increase in the number of ferns relative to other terrestrial [[plant]]s after the [[extinction]] or [[thinning]] of the latter, probably because fern [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] is more rapid over large geographic areas, since single-celled fern spores are more easily distributed by the wind than are seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Plants: Evolution and Diversity|author1=Ingrouille, M. |author2=Eddie, B. |page=163|isbn=113945546X|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fern spikes are most associated with the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1130/0091-7613(1996)024&lt;0963:CTCIAA&gt;2.3.CO;2 | last1 = Schultz | first1 = P.H. | last2 = D'Hondt | first2 = S. | year = 1996 | title = Cretaceous-Tertiary (Chicxulub) impact angle and its consequences | url = http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/11/963 | journal = Geology | volume = 24 | issue = 11| pages = 963–967 |bibcode = 1996Geo....24..963S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1064706 | last1 = Vajda | first1 = V. | last2 = Raine | first2 = J.I. | last3 = Hollis | first3 = C.J. | year = 2001 | title = Indication of global deforestation at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary by New Zealand fern spike | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/294/5547/1700 | journal = Science | volume = 294 | issue = 5547| pages = 1700–1702 | pmid = 11721051 |bibcode = 2001Sci...294.1700V }}&lt;/ref&gt; although they have been found at other events such as at the [[Triassic]]-[[Jurassic]] boundary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0040-1951(93)90359-R | last1 = Fowell | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Olsen | first2 = P.E. | year = 1993 | title = Time calibration of Triassic-Jurassic microfloral turnover, eastern North-America | url = | journal = [[Tectonophysics (journal)|Tectonophysics]] | volume = 222 | issue = 3–4| pages = 361–369 |bibcode = 1993Tectp.222..361F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1065522 | last1 = Olsen | first1 = P.

A fixed allele is [[homozygous]] for all members of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biochem.northwestern.edu/holmgren/Glossary/Definitions/Def-F/fixed_allele.html|title=fixed allele definition|website=www.biochem.northwestern.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''allele'' normally refers to one variant gene out of several possible for a particular [[locus (genetics)|locus]] in the DNA. When all but one allele go extinct and only one remains, that allele is said to be fixed.

There are only two ways in which a fixed allele can become un-fixed. This can happen through random mutations that lead to the development of a new allele. Or this can happen through immigration.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Genetics: From Genes to Genomes|last = Hartwell|first = Leland|publisher = McGraw-Hill|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-07-352526-6|location = New York|pages = 655–697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fixed Population.png|thumb|180x180px|The rabbit population after the brown allele becomes fixed.]]
To illustrate what a fixed allele, lets imagine a population of rabbits where there are three alleles for fur color brown, gray or white. In this initial population, there is no fixed allele. Then an event, such as a forest fire, causes the elimination of one of the alleles from the population. Lets assume all the gray rabbits were killed in a forest fire, and now all that remains in the population are the white and brown alleles. This happens in the summer, so there is no snow, and the white rabbits fall prey to owls more often than brown rabbits. Eventually the only remaining allele in the population is the brown allele, this allele is now a fixed allele.

Fixed alleles are a very important aspect of evolutionary biology. Low genetic diversity, which is seen with allele fixation, is dangerous as it can lead to mass extinctions. If there is little genetic variability within a population and the genetically similar individuals all are susceptible to a certain pathogen, the population will likely cease to exist. This is why we see examples of populations with fixed alleles becoming threatened or endangered.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

A great example of why fixed alleles matter is the US agriculture supply and the threat of bioterrorism. Many crops grown in the US are genetically similar, and allows for the possibility of devastating bioterrorism. Should a pathogen be developed targets certain crop supplies, such as corn, which are pivotal to the US food supply and therefore vital to the US's economic state, disastrous events could occur as the food supply could be depleted very quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Process of allele fixation ==
[[Fixation (population genetics)|Fixation]] is the process through which an allele becomes a fixed allele within a population. There are many ways for an allele to become fixed, but most often it is through the action of multiple processes working together. The key driving force behind fixation is natural selection and genetic drift. Natural selection was postulated by Darwin and encompasses many processes that lead to the differential survival of organisms due to genetic or phenotypic differences. Genetic drift is the process by which allele frequencies fluctuate within populations. Natural selection and genetic drift propel evolution forward, and through evolution alleles can become fixed.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  
 
The [[natural selection]] processes such as sexual, convergent, divergent or stabilizing selection pave the way for allele fixation. One way some of these natural selection processes cause fixation is through one specific genotype or phenotype being favored, which leads to the convergence of the variability until one allele become fixed. Natural selection can work the other way, where two alleles become fixed through two specific genotypes or phenotypes being favored, leading to divergence within the population until the populations become so separate that they are now two species each with their own fixed allele.

Selective pressures can favor certain genotypes or phenotypes. A commonly known example of this is the process of antibiotic resistance within bacterial populations. As antibiotics are used to kill bacteria, a small number of them with favorable mutations can survive and repopulate in an environment that is now free of competition. The allele for antibiotic resistance then becomes a fixed allele within the surviving and future populations. This is an example of the [[bottleneck effect]]. A bottleneck occurs when a population is put under strong selective pressure, and only certain individuals survive. These surviving individuals have a decreased number of alleles present within their population than were present in the initial population, however these remaining alleles are the only ones left in future populations assuming no mutation or migration. This bottleneck effect can also be seen in natural disaster, as shown in the rabbit example above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[File:Allele-frequency.png|thumb|This image shows how though successive generations random allele fluctuations, or genetic drift, can lead to the fixation or loss of certain alleles within a population.]]
Similar to the bottleneck effect, the [[founder's effect]] can also cause allele fixation. The founder effect occurs when a small founding population is moved a new area and propagates the future population. This can be seen in the ''[[Alces alces]]'' moose population in Newfoundland, Canada. Moose are not native to Newfoundland, and in 1878 and 1904 six total moose were introduced to the island. The six founding moose propagated the current population of an estimated 4000-6000 moose. This has had dramatic effects on the offspring of the founding moose and has led to a great decrease in genetic variability within the Newfoundland moose population as compared to the mainland population.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal

Other random processes such as genetic drift can lead to fixation. Through these random processes, some random individuals or alleles are removed from the population. These random fluctuations within the allele frequencies can lead to the fixation or loss of certain alleles within a population. To the right is an image that shows thorough successive generations; the allele frequencies fluctuate randomly within a population. The smaller your population size, the faster fixation or loss of alleles will occur. However, it should be noted that all populations are driven to allele fixation and it is inevitable, it just takes varying amounts of time for this to occur due to population size.  
 
Some other causes of allele fixation are [[inbreeding]], as this decreases the genetic variability of the population and therefore decreases the effective population size.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows genetic drift to cause fixation faster than anticipated.   
 
Isolation can also cause fixation, as it prevents the influx of new variable alleles into the population. This can often be seen on island populations, where the populations have a limited set of alleles. The only variability that can be added to these populations is through mutations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Examples ==
One example of a fixed allele is the DGAT-1 exon 8 in [[Water buffalo|Anatolian buffalo]]. A non-conservative mutation in the DGAT-1 allele, which produces a protein with a lysine at position 232 instead of an alanine. This mutation produces a protein different from the wild type protein. This mutation in cattle has an effect in milk production. Investigation into three water buffalo populations revealed four different haplotypes each having a [[single nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP), however all of these SNPs were conservative mutations, causing no change in protein production. All populations of Anatolian buffalo studied had the non-conservative lysine mutation at 232, leading to the conclusion that this DGAT-1 allele mutation is fixed within the populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1871141312002405/1-s2.0-S1871141312002405-main.pdf?_tid=eb6de922-ccfa-11e5-b46f-00000aacb35f&amp;acdnat=1454781556_174b62d7ef63afbb058a338197c3f8c6|title = DGAT1-exon8 polymorphism in Anatolian buffalo|last = Özdil|first = Fulya|date = 21 July 2012|journal = Livestock Science|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 6 Feb 2016|last2 = Ilhan|first2 = Fatma|issue = 1-2|volume = 149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six microsatellites were examined looking at the current population in 2008 as well as museum samples from 1895 to 1989.

'''Forced prostitution''', also known as '''involuntary prostitution''', is [[prostitution]] or [[sexual slavery]] that takes place as a result of [[coercion]] by a third party. The terms "forced prostitution" or "enforced prostitution" appear in international and humanitarian conventions such as [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court]]&lt;ref&gt;Article 7: [[Crime against humanity]]&lt;/ref&gt; but have been insufficiently understood and inconsistently applied. "Forced prostitution" refers to conditions of control over a person who is coerced by another to engage in sexual activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/0/3d25270b5fa3ea998025665f0032f220?OpenDocument |title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on systematic rape |publisher=Unhchr.ch |date= |accessdate=7 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112211407/http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/0/3d25270b5fa3ea998025665f0032f220?OpenDocument |archivedate=12 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced prostitution is a crime against the person because of the violation of the victim's rights of movement through coercion and because of their commercial exploitation.

==Legal situation==
'''Forced prostitution''' is illegal under [[customary law]] in all countries.&lt;ref name="Bantekas 2003 6"&gt;{{cite book |title= International Criminal Law|edition=2d|last= Bantekas |first= Ilias |author2=Susan Nash |year= 2003|publisher=Routledge |location= Cavendish |isbn= 978-1859417768 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MyP4tSaMA_IC|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is different from voluntary prostitution which may have a different legal status in different countries, which range from being fully illegal and [[punishable by death]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/iran.htm|title=Iran - Facts on Trafficking and Prostitution|publisher=|accessdate=25 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008164248/http://www.uri.edu/artsci/wms/hughes/iran.htm|archivedate=8 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to being legal and regulated as an occupation.

While the legality of adult prostitution varies between jurisdictions, the [[prostitution of children]] is illegal nearly everywhere in the world.

In 1949, the [[UN General Assembly]] adopted the [[Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others]]. This Convention supersedes a number of earlier conventions that covered some aspects of forced prostitution, and also deals with other aspects of prostitution. It penalises the procurement and enticement to prostitution as well as the maintenance of [[brothels]].&lt;ref name="Bantekas 2003 6"/&gt; As at December 2013, the Convention has only been ratified by 82 countries.&lt;ref name=ratifications&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=VII-11-a&amp;chapter=7&amp;lang=en |title=UNTC |publisher= |accessdate=25 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907020434/https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=VII-11-a&amp;chapter=7&amp;lang=en |archivedate=7 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main reasons it has not been ratified by many countries is because it 'voluntary' is broadly defined in countries with a legal sex industry.&lt;ref name="Bantekas 2003 6"/&gt; For example, in countries such as [[Germany]],&lt;ref name="economist-prostitution2004" /&gt; [[the Netherlands]],&lt;ref name="economist-prostitution2004" /&gt; [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref name="Economist-prostitution-2008"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_TNVTGVRN|title=Policing prostitution: The oldest conundrum|publisher=The Economist|date=30 October 2008|accessdate=11 January 2010}} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2002/18368.htm|title=Greece|work=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Turkey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/world/middleeast/24iht-m24-turkey-brothel.html|title=Turkey Cracks Down on Legal Brothels|first=Susanne|last=Güsten|date=23 January 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries some forms of prostitution and pimping are legal and regulated as professional occupations.

==Child prostitution==
{{Main| Child prostitution}}
Child prostitution is considered inherently non-consensual and exploitative, as children, because of their age, are not legally able to consent. In most countries child prostitution is illegal irrespective of the child reaching a lower statutory [[age of consent]].

State parties to the [[Optional Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography]] are required to prohibit child prostitution. The Protocol defines a child as any human being under the age of 18, "unless an earlier [[age of majority]] is recognized by a country's law". The Protocol entered into force on 18 January 2002,&lt;ref name=Protocol2&gt;{{cite web|title=Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography|work=United Nations Treaty Collection|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=IV-11-c&amp;chapter=4&amp;lang=en|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as of December 2013, 166 states are party to the Protocol and another 10 states have signed but not yet ratified it.&lt;ref name=Protocol2/&gt;

The [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999]] (Convention No 104) of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) provides that the ''use, procuring or offering of a child for prostitution'' is one of the ''worst forms of [[child labor]]''. This [[Treaty|convention]], adopted in 1999, provides that countries that had ratified it must eliminate the practice urgently. It enjoys the fastest pace of ratifications in the ILO's history since 1919.

In the United States, the [[Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000]] classifies any "commercial sex act [which] is induced by force, fraud, or coercion, or in which the person induced to perform such act has not attained 18 years of age" to be a "Severe Form of Trafficking in Persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/tip/laws/61124.htm|title=Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000|publisher=US State Department|accessdate=17 February 2010|date=28 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, especially poorer countries, child prostitution remains a very serious problem, and numerous tourists from the [[Western World]] travel to these countries to engage in [[child sex tourism]]. [[Child prostitution in Thailand|Thailand]], [[Cambodia]], [[India]], [[Brazil]] and [[Child prostitution in Mexico|Mexico]] have been identified as leading hotspots of child sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38872 |title=RIGHTS-MEXICO: 16,000 Victims of Child Sexual Exploitation |author=Emilio Godoy |publisher=IPS |date=13 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326111520/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=38872 |archivedate=26 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human trafficking==
{{Main|Human trafficking}}
{{Slavery}}
Human trafficking, especially of girls and women, often leads to forced prostitution and sexual slavery. According to a report by the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UNODC]], internationally, the most common destinations for victims of human trafficking are [[Thailand]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], [[Israel]], [[Belgium]], [[the Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Turkey]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6497799.stm|title=UN highlights human trafficking|date=26 March 2007|accessdate=11 January 2010|publisher=the [[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major sources of trafficked persons are Thailand, [[China]], [[Nigeria]], [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Belarus]], [[Moldova]], and [[Ukraine]].&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

Following the first international conference on the prevention of trafficking of women in Paris in 1885 a series of initiatives to restrict the trade of women into the sex trade were initiated. Both the [[League of Nations]] and the [[United Nations]] have addressed the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Global Sex|last= Altman|first=Dennis |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location= |isbn= 9780226016054 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XC0QDlW3YFAC&amp;dq=forced+prostitution |page=114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] report estimates that globally, 79% of identified victims of human trafficking were trafficked for sexual exploitation, 18% for forced labor, and 3% for other forms of exploitation. In 2011, preliminary [[European Commission]] in September 2011 similarly estimated that among human-trafficking victims, 75% were trafficked for sexual exploitation and the rest for forced labor or other forms of exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;''The EU Strategy towards the Eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings, 2012–2016'', [[European Commission]] [[Directorate-General for Migration and Home Affairs]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the illegal nature of prostitution and the different methodologies used in separating forced prostitution from voluntary prostitution, the extent of this phenomenon is difficult to estimate accurately. According to a 2008 report by the [[U.S. Department of State]]: "Annually, according to U.S. Government-sponsored research completed in 2006, 600,000 to 800,000 people are trafficked across national borders, which does not include millions trafficked within their own countries. Approximately 80% of transnational victims are women and girls and up to 50% are minors, and the majority of transnational victims are trafficked into commercial sexual exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2005/46606.htm|title=Trafficking in Persons Report, I. Introduction|accessdate=30 January 2010|date= 3 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 [[European Commission]] report found that from 2010 to 2013, a total of 30,146 people were registered as victims of human trafficking in the 28 [[member states of the European Union]]; of these, 69% were victims of sexual exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29660126 Trafficking harms 30,000 in EU - most in sex trade], BBC News (October 17, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, ''[[The Economist]]'' claimed that only a small proportion of prostitutes were explicitly trafficked against their will.&lt;ref name="economist-prostitution2004"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/3151258|title=Prostitution: Sex is their business|date=2 September 2004|accessdate=15 December 2009|publisher=The Economist}} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Pisani]] protested against the perceived hysteria around human trafficking preceding sport events like the Super Bowl or World Cup of Soccer.&lt;ref name="wisdomOfWhores-traffick"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pisani|first1=Elizabeth|authorlink=Elizabeth Pisani|title=The Wisdom of Whores: Bureaucrats, Brothels and the Business of AIDS|pages=213–214|url=http://www.wisdomofwhores.com/|publisher=Granta Books|isbn=978-1-84708-076-9|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children]] (also referred to as the Palermo Protocol) is a [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] to the United Nations [[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]] and defines human trafficking as the "recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unodc.org/documents/treaties/UNTOC/Publications/TOC%20Convention/TOCebook-e.pdf "United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime"], Annex II, Section I, Article 3 (pg. 42). Retrieved on 21 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, threat, coercion, or use of force is not necessary to constitute trafficking, the exploitation of an existing vulnerability{{snd}}such as economic vulnerability or sexual vulnerability{{snd}}is sufficient. [[Sigma Huda]], UN special reporter on trafficking in persons, observed that "For the most part, prostitution as actually practiced in the world usually does satisfy the elements of trafficking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prostitution and Human Trafficking: Tackling Demand &lt;!--The Criminal Justice and Immigration Bill:A Briefing from CARE--&gt; |url=http://chaste.org.uk/public_documents/CJI_Briefing_Doc_CARE_CHASTE_001.pdf |accessdate=19 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305202011/http://www.chaste.org.uk/public_documents/CJI_Briefing_Doc_CARE_CHASTE_001.pdf |archivedate=5 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissuesmagazine.com/july08/july2008_5.php|title="It's Not TV, Its Sexploitation" Protest Against Home Box Office|author=Norma Ramos|publisher=On the Issues Magazine|date=Summer 2008|accessdate=11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Save the Children]] see explicit trafficking and prostitution as different issues: "The issue [human trafficking] however, gets mired in controversy and confusion when prostitution too is considered as a violation of the basic human rights of both adult women and minors, and equal to sexual exploitation per se.

==Voluntary vs involuntary prostitution==
With regard to prostitution, three worldviews exist: ''abolitionism'' (where the prostitute is considered a victim), ''regulation'' (where the prostitute is considered a worker) and ''prohibitionism'' (where the prostitute is considered a criminal). Currently all these views are represented in some Western country.

For the proponents of the abolitionist view, prostitution is always a coercive practice, and the prostitute is seen as a victim. They argue that most prostitutes are forced into the practice, either directly, by [[pimps]] and [[human trafficking|traffickers]], indirectly through [[poverty]], [[drug addiction]] and other personal problems, or, as it has been argued in recent decades by [[radical feminists]] such as [[Andrea Dworkin]], [[Melissa Farley]] and [[Catharine MacKinnon]], merely by [[patriarchal]] social structures and power relations between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/MichLawJourI.html|title=Prostitution and Male Supremacy|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;
William D. Angel finds that "most" prostitutes have been forced into the occupation through poverty, lack of education and employment possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The International Law of Youth Rights |last= Angel |first= William D. |year= 1995 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff |location= |isbn= 9780792333210 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=3kT3fTMoggIC&amp;vq=forced+prostitution&amp;dq=involuntary+prostitution |page=897}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kathleen Barry]] argues that there should be no distinction between "free" and "coerced", "voluntary" and "involuntary" prostitution, "since any form of prostitution is a human rights violation, an affront to womanhood that cannot be considered dignified labour".&lt;ref name="Lim 1998 14"&gt;{{cite book |title= The Sex Sector: The Economic and Social Bases of Prostitution in Southeast Asia |last= Lim |first= Lean |year= 1998 |publisher=International Labour Office |location= |isbn= 9789221095224 |page=14 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=VFNKZbL1jWwC&amp;vq=barry&amp;dq=%22involuntary+prostitution%22+definition}}&lt;/ref&gt;
France's [[The Greens (France)|Green Party]] argues: "The concept of "free choice" of the prostitute is indeed relative, in a society where gender inequality is institutionalized".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesverts.fr/spip.php?article120|title=Prostitution : les Verts opposés à la réouverture des maisons closes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The proponents of the abolitionist view hold that prostitution is a practice which ultimately leads to the mental, emotional and physical destruction of the women who engage in it, and, as such, it should be abolished.  As a result of such views on prostitution, [[Sweden]],&lt;ref name="Economist-prostitution-2008" /&gt; [[Norway]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7806760.stm|title=New Norway law bans buying of sex|date=1 January 2009|accessdate=19 January 2010|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Iceland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jafnretti.is/jafnretti/?D10cID=ReadNews&amp;ID=523|title=A new law makes purchase of sex illegal in Iceland|date=21 April 2009|accessdate=19 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; have enacted laws which criminalize the clients of the prostitutes, but not the prostitutes themselves.

In contrast to the abolitionist view, those who are in favour of legalization do not consider the women who practice prostitution as victims, but as independent adult women who had made a choice which should be respected. Mariska Majoor, former prostitute and founder of the [[Prostitution Information Center]], from [[Amsterdam]],  holds that: "In our [sex workers'] eyes it's a profession, a way of making money; it's important that we are realistic about this ... Prostitution is not bad; it's only bad if done against one's will. Most women make this decision themselves."&lt;ref name="allow"&gt;Allow ''Women to Sell Their Bodies to Earn a Living'', Monitor (Uganda), Apr. 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to proponents of regulation, prostitution should be considered a legitimate activity,  which must be recognized and regulated, in order to protect the workers' rights and to prevent abuse. The prostitutes are treated as [[sex workers]] who enjoy benefits similar to other [[Job (role)|occupations]]. The [[World Charter for Prostitutes Rights]] (1985), drafted by the [[International Committee for Prostitutes' Rights]], calls for the decriminalisation of "all aspects of adult prostitution resulting from individual decision".&lt;ref name="Lim 1998 14"/&gt; Since the mid-1970s, sex workers across the world have organised, demanding the [[decriminalisation]] of [[prostitution]], equal protection under the law, improved working conditions, the right to pay [[taxes]], travel and receive [[social benefits]] such as [[pension]]s.&lt;ref name="hiholv1i6"&gt;{{cite news|author=Amalia Cabezos|title=Hookers in the House of the Lord|publisher=Santa Monica Mirror|date=28 July – 4 August 1999|url=http://www.smmirror.com/Volume1/issue6/hooker.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080820101422/http://www.smmirror.com/Volume1/issue6/hooker.html|archivedate=20 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of such views on prostitution, countries such as [[Germany]],&lt;ref name="economist-prostitution2004" /&gt; the [[Netherlands]]&lt;ref name="Economist-prostitution-2008" /&gt; and [[New Zealand]]&lt;ref name="Economist-prostitution-2008" /&gt; have fully legalized prostitution. Prostitution is considered a job like any other, and pimps are seen as businessmen.

==Legal discrimination==
Sexual [[discrimination]] happens to those who work both in [[sex work]] and forced prostitution. Historically, crimes involving [[violence against women]] and having to do with prostitution and sex work have been taken less seriously by the law. Although acts such as the [[Violence Against Women Act]] have been passed to take steps toward preventing such violence, there is still sexism rooted in the way that the legal system approaches these cases. Gender based violence is a serious form of discrimination that has slipped through many cracks in the legal system of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Neuwirth, Jessica. ''Equal Means Equal''. p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts have fallen short due to the fact that there is no constitutional protection for women against discrimination.

There is often no evidence, according to police, that when men are arrested for soliciting a prostitute that it is a gender based crime. However, there are large discrepancies between the arrests of prostitutes and the arrests of men caught in the act. While 70% of prostitution related arrests are of woman prostitutes, only 10% of related arrests are men/customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bayswan.org/stats.html "PENet: Prostitution Issues: Statistics"]. ''www.bayswan.org''. Retrieved 7 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless if the girl or woman is either underage or forced into the exchange, she is still often arrested and victim blamed instead of being offered resources. The men who are charged with engaging in these illegal acts with woman who are prostitutes are able to pay for the exchange and therefore are usually able to pay for their release while the woman may not be able to. This generates a cycle of violence against women, as the situation’s outcome favors the man. In one case, a nineteen-year-old woman in Oklahoma was charged with offering to engage in prostitution when the woman was known to have previously been a victim of human sex trafficking.&lt;ref name="OSCN Case Details"&gt;[http://www.oscn.net/dockets/GetCaseInformation.aspx?db=oklahoma&amp;number=CF-2015-2310&amp;cmid=3247403 "OSCN Case Details"]. ''www.oscn.net''. Retrieved 5 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; She is an example of how the criminalization of prostitution often leads to women being arrested multiple times due to the fact that they are often punished or arrested even when the victim of a situation.&lt;ref name="OSCN Case Details"/&gt; Young women and girls have a much higher likelihood of getting arrested for prostitution than boys in general, and woman victims of human trafficking often end up being arrested upon multiple occasions, being registered as a sex offender, and being institutionalized.The lack of rehabilitation given to women after experiences with human [[sex trafficking]] contributes to the cycles of arrests that most woman who engage in prostitution face.

The ERA or [[Equal Rights Amendment]] is a proposed amendment to the [[United States Constitution|U.S Constitution]] that has not yet been ratified. It would guarantee that equal rights could not be denied under the law on account of sex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/ "ERA: Home"]. ''www.equalrightsamendment.org''. Retrieved 7 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; With this amendment in place, it would allow for sex workers and victims of human sex trafficking to have legal leverage when it comes to the discrepancies in how men and women (customers and prostitutes) are prosecuted. This is due to the fact that there would be legal grounds to argue the unequal legal treatment on account of sex, which is not currently outlawed by the U.S constitution. Although there are other acts and laws that protect against discrimination based on a variety of categories and identities, they are often not substantial enough, provide loopholes, and do not offer adequate protection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equalrightsamendment.org/faq.htm#q10 "ERA: FAQ"]. ''www.equalrightsamendment.org''. Retrieved 7 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; This connects to [[liberal feminism]] and the more individualistic approach that comes with this theory. Liberal feminists believe that there should be equality between the sexes and this should be gained through equal legal rights, equal education, and women having "greater self value as individuals".&lt;ref&gt;Wendell, Susan (1987). ''A (Qualified) Defense of Liberal Feminism''. Hypatia. pp. 65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory focuses on equality at a more individual level as supposed to rethinking legal systems themselves or systems of gender, just as the ERA works for the equality of sexes within an existing system.

In Mexico, many criminal organisations lure, and capture women and use them in brothels. Once the women become useless to the organisations, they are often killed. Often, the criminal organisations focus on poor, unemployed girls, and lure them via job offerings (regular jobs), done via billboards and posters, placed on the streets. In some cities, like [[Ciudad Juárez]], there is a high degree of corruption in all levels on the social ladder (police, courts, ...) which makes it more difficult to combat this criminal activity. Hotels where women are kept and which are known by the police are often also not raided/closed down by police. Nor are the job offerings actively investigated.&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Delarosa Hickerson on corruption in Ciudad Juárez&lt;/ref&gt; Some NGO's such as [[Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa A.C.]] are trying to fight back, often without much success.

For the last decade it has been estimated that 6,000 - 7,000 girls are trafficked out of Nepal each year. But these numbers have recently risen substantially. Current numbers for girls trafficked out of the country are now 10,000 to 15,000 yearly. This is compounded as the US Central Intelligence Agency states that most trafficked girls are currently worth, in their span as a sex-worker, approx $250,000 (USD) on the sex-trades market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://womennewsnetwork.net/2008/12/05/lostdaughternepal808/ "Lost Daughters - An Ongoing Tragedy in Nepal,"] Women News Network - WNN, 5 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

====North Korea====
{{Main|Prostitution in North Korea}}

The North Korean state engages in forced prostitution. Girls as young as 14 years old are drafted to work in the ''[[kippŭmjo]]''. Not all ''kippŭmjo'' work as prostitutes; the source used is unclear as to whether only adult women are assigned to prostitution, or whether there is [[prostitution of children]]. Other ''kippŭmjo'' activities are massaging and half-naked singing and dancing.  According to the same source from April 2005, "60 to 70% of [[North Korean defectors#In China|[North Korean] defectors {{bracket|in the People's Republic of China}}]] are women, 70 to 80% of whom are victims of human trafficking." North Korean authorities severely punish or even kill repatriated prostitutes and kill their Chinese-fathered children, born and unborn alike.&lt;ref name=jeongjs&gt;"[http://www.awomansvoice.org/nl1-2004-2.html Intervention Agenda Item 12: Elimination of Violence Against Women] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306003144/http://www.awomansvoice.org/nl1-2004-2.html |date=6 March 2012 }}" at the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] in April 2004; speaker: Ji Sun JEONG for ''A Woman's Voice International''&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced prostitution has existed throughout history.

[[German military brothels in World War II|German military brothels]] were set up by the [[Third Reich]] during [[World War II]] throughout much of occupied Europe for the use of [[Wehrmacht]] and [[SS]] soldiers.&lt;ref name="Herbermann" /&gt; These brothels were generally new creations, but in the West, they were sometimes set up using existing [[brothel]]s as well as many other buildings. Until 1942, there were around 500 military brothels of this kind in [[German-occupied Europe]].&lt;ref name="Sander"&gt;Helge Sander, Barbara Johr (Hrsg.), ''Befreier und Befreite - Krieg - Vergewaltigung - Kinder'', Frankfurt a.M. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Often operating in confiscated hotels and guarded by the [[Wehrmacht]], these facilities used to serve travelling soldiers and those withdrawn from the front.&lt;ref name="Yudkin"&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite book |editor=Leon Yudkin |title=Hebrew Literature in the Wake of the Holocaust |year=1993 |publisher=[[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] Press |isbn=978-0-8386-3499-8 |pages=13–32 |chapter=Narrative Perspectives on Holocaust Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lenten"&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite book |last=Lenten |first=Ronit |title=Israel and the Daughters of the Shoah: Reoccupying the Territories of Silence |year=2000 |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=978-1-57181-775-4 |pages=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to records, at least 34,140 European women were forced to serve as prostitutes during the German occupation of their own countries along with female prisoners of [[German camp brothels in World War II|concentration camp brothels]].&lt;ref name="Herbermann"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nanda Herbermann |author2=Hester Baer |author3=Elizabeth Roberts Baer | title =The Blessed Abyss: Inmate #6582 in Ravensbruck Concentration Camp for Women | year =2000 | pages =33–34 | publisher =[[Wayne State University]] Press | location =Detroit | isbn=978-0-8143-2920-7 | url =https://books.google.com/?id=3JM3AdnmE18C&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%22it+is+impossible+to+speak+of+free+will+when+considering+the+circumstances%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22it%20is%20impossible%20to%20speak%20of%20free%20will%20when%20considering%20the%20circumstances%22&amp;f=false | format =[[Google Books]] | accessdate =12 January 2011}} {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases in Eastern Europe, the women involved were kidnapped on the streets of occupied cities during German military and police [[Roundup (history)|round up]]s called ''łapanka'' or  ''rafle''.&lt;ref name="Yudkin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lenten"/&gt;

In [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] established brothels in the concentration camps (''[[Lagerbordell]]'') to create an incentive for prisoners to collaborate, although these institutions were used mostly by [[Kapo (concentration camp)|Kapos]], "prisoner functionaries" and the criminal element, because regular inmates, penniless and emaciated, were usually too debilitated and wary of exposure to [[Schutzstaffel]] (SS) schemes. In the end, the camp brothels did not produce any noticeable increase in the prisoners' work productivity levels, but instead, created a market for coupons among the camp VIPs.&lt;ref name="wollheim"&gt;[http://www.wollheim-memorial.de/en/lagerbordell_en "Camp Brothel".] ''Wollheim Memorial''.

Around 200,000 are typically estimated to have been involved, with estimates as low as 20,000 from some Japanese scholars&lt;ref name="AWF_CW"&gt;{{Harvnb|Asian Women'sFund|p=10|Ref=AWF-CW}}&lt;/ref&gt; and estimates of up to 410,000 from some Chinese scholars,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rose|2005|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=W2nU1Xu0XdkC&amp;pg=PA88 88]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the disagreement about exact numbers is still being researched and debated.

Young women from countries under Japanese Imperial control were reportedly abducted from their homes. In some cases, women were also recruited with offers to work in the military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Yoshimi|2000|pp=100–101, 105–106, 110–111}};&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|Fackler 2007-03-06|Ref=CITEREFNY Times2007-03-06}};&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|BBC 2007-03-02}};&lt;br /&gt;{{Harvnb|BBC 2007-03-08}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been documented that the Japanese military itself recruited women by force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|van Buitenlandse zaken|1994|pp=6–9, 11, 13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Japanese historian [[Ikuhiko Hata]] stated that there was no organized forced recruitment of comfort women by the Japanese government or military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The number and nature of comfort women servicing the Japanese military during World War II is still being actively debated, and the matter is still highly political in both Japan and the rest of the [[Far East|Far East Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;According to journalist Satoshi Ikeuchi: "Even though the forcible recruitment of women was not systematically implemented, the (Japanese) government should acknowledge its moral responsibility if any single woman victimized by the private operators through fraud, exploitation, violence or other acts of intimidation comes forward to tell her story. The government should do so because the military gave consent to set up brothels for soldiers and had responsibility for overseeing them.»  «In this context, the issue of the so-called comfort women was invested with extreme importance as the epitome of Japanese sin from the viewpoint of some and became the focal point of contention, The excessive effort by leftists and liberals in politicizing this issue as one of the few means left to shake conservative dominance, by extending the notion of coercion to the extreme, resulted in alienating a large part of the nation. Their open intention to collude with rising tides of hostile nationalism in Korea and China also hardened the minds of many in Japan." 25 April 2007. Satoshi Ikeuchi, [http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/columns/commentary/20070425dy01.htm Overcoming postwar mind-set], Daily Yomuri Online, 25 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many military brothels were run by private agents and supervised by the Korean Police. Some Japanese historians, using the testimony of ex-comfort women, have argued that the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Navy]] were either directly or indirectly involved in coercing, deceiving, luring, and sometimes kidnapping young women throughout Japan's [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere|Asian colonies and occupied territories]].&lt;ref name="denial"&gt;{{Harvnb|Onishi 2007-03-08|Ref=CITEREFNY Times2007-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===

In Southern [[India]] &amp; eastern Indian state of [[Odisha]], [[devadasi]] is the practice of hierodulic prostitution, with similar customary forms such as basavi,&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Slavery Society. [http://anti-slaverysociety.addr.com/hieroras.htm Child Hierodulic Servitude in India and Nepal]&lt;/ref&gt; and involves dedicating pre-pubescent and young adolescent girls from villages in a ritual marriage to a deity or a temple, who then work in the temple and function as spiritual guides, dancers, and prostitutes servicing male devotees in the temple. [[Human Rights Watch]] reports claim that devadasis are forced into this service and, at least in some cases, to practice prostitution for upper-caste members.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Watch. [http://hrw.org/campaigns/caste/presskit.htm Caste: Asia's Hidden Apartheid]&lt;/ref&gt;

Various state governments in [[India]] enacted laws to ban this practice both prior to India's independence and more recently. They include Bombay Devdasi Act, 1934, Devdasi (Prevention of dedication) Madras Act, 1947, Karnataka Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1982, and Andhra Pradesh Devdasi (Prohibition of dedication) Act, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women.

The external funding ratio was 75 percent. 49,8 percent of the budget came from industrial revenues, 13 percent from federal and state contract research, and 6,5 percent from funds provided by the European Union. Around 270 employees and 140 students worked at the institute in 2015.

==History==
=== Establishment of the institute ===
The founding phase of the [[Heinrich Hertz|Heinrich Hertz Institute]] began on August 1, 1927 with the written intention of the Study Society for Oscillation Research to establish an institute for the research on electrical and acoustic oscillation at the Technical University of Berlin. Members of this society were the [[Reichspost|German Reichspost]], the Prussian Ministry of Science, Art and National Education, the [[Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft]], the [[Technical University of Berlin|Technische Hochschule zu Berlin]], the large corporations of the electrical industry, and the [[Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik|German Electrical Engineering Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freunde.hhi.de/html/historisches.html History of the Heinrich-Hertz Institute] – www.freunde.hhi.de, as of January 31,2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Effectively, the institute was founded on February 23, 1928 as Heinrich Hertz Institute for Oscillation Research. The opening took place in 1930 in Berlin-Charlottenburg, Franklinstrasse 1, with the 4 departments: High-Frequency Engineering, Telecommunications and Telegraph Technology, Acoustics and Mechanics. Research focused on radio and television technology, room acoustics and electronic music among other things. 
The institute was reorganized in 1936 and the name Heinrich Hertz was wiped out from its designation in the course of [[Nazism|National Socialist]] [[Purge|"cleansing"]] in the interest of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]].

=== Post World War II ===
After the institute building was entirely destroyed in 1945, the Heinrich Hertz Institute for Oscillation Research was newly founded in the same year by Gustav Leithäuser with the former department structure. During the time of the currency reform and [[Berlin Blockade]] in 1950, the institute was split into an eastern section ([[Berlin-Adlershof]]) and a western section ([[Berlin-Charlottenburg]], Jebensstrasse 1). In 1968 the institute moved into the new building at Einsteinufer 37 in Berlin.

=== Institute with state and federal participation ===
The institute was renamed to Heinrich-Hertz-Institut for Nachrichtentechnik Berlin GmbH (Heinrich-Hertz Institute for Communication Technology) in 1975 with the state of [[Berlin]] and the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] as shareholders. Realignment of the entire HHI research profile by Horst Ohnsorge. Systematic work on current problems of modern communication technology. Vision of a universal broadband communication network on a fiber optics basis. 5 specialist departments: General Principles; System Structures; Image and Sound; Relaying and Transmission; Planning. Support for optical communication engineering as a key technology at HHI in the 1980s. Restructuring of the institute with formation of two divisions: Communication Systems with the departments of Relaying and Transmission, Signal Processing and Terminal Equipment, Economic and Social Sciences Accompanying Research, and Human Engineering, and the division: Integrated Optics.

In the 1990s research focused on the following fields: Photonic networks, electronic imaging technology for multimedia, mobile broadband systems, and integrated optics.

=== Transition to the Fraunhofer Society ===
The institute became part of the [[Fraunhofer Society]] in 2003 and received today’s name, Fraunhofer Institute for Telecommunications, Heinrich Hertz Institute, HHI. The institute has been cooperating with the neighboring [[Technical University of Berlin]] for decades.

A data transmission system was successfully developed in 2006 with a never-before-seen speed of 2560 [[Gb/s]], which means transmitting a data volume corresponding to the content of 60 [[DVD]]s takes one second. What’s more, a breakthrough was achieved in video compression making it possible to store motion pictures in the high-resolution [[High-definition television|HDTV]] format with 2 million pixels per image on DVD.

On November 10, 2016 scientists of the Fraunhofer HHI established a bidirectional 1.7 [[Terabit|Tbit]]/s [[Free-space optical communication|free-space optical communications]] link over the air. The eye-safe optical beam transmission was transmitted over a distance of 380 meters. Eye-safe operation through 380-m air was successfully demonstrated at a total antenna output power of less than 10 [[Milliwatt|mW]]. The signals in both directions consisted of 40 wavelength channels of 43 Gbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hhi.fraunhofer.de/en/press-media/news/2016/2x17-terabits-eye-safe-optical-link-demonstrated-over-380-meters-at-fraunhofer-hhi.html 2x1.7-Terabit/s eye-safe optical link demonstrated over 380 meters at Fraunhofer HHI] – hhi.fraunhofer.de, February 2, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{French art history}}
&lt;!-- For practical purposes, the history of French art has been divided into a series of separate articles accessible through the template to the right. The template also gives direct access to French art category indexes, such as alphabetical lists of painters or sculptors. To locate artists from a particular period or art movement, the relatively comprehensive manual list of painters and artistic movements in chronological order is recommended. In addition to a brief historic overview, some supplementary or general material is included on this page, including art vocabulary and general French art references.--&gt;

'''French art''' consists of the [[visual arts|visual]] and [[plastic arts]] (including architecture, woodwork, textiles, and ceramics) originating from the geographical area of [[France]]. Modern France was the main centre for the European [[art of the Upper Paleolithic]], then left many [[megalith]]ic monuments, and in the [[Iron Age]] many of the most impressive finds of early [[Celtic art]]. The [[Gallo-Roman]] period left a distinctive provincial style of sculpture, and the region around the modern Franco-German border led the empire in the mass production of finely decorated [[Ancient Roman pottery]], which was exported to Italy and elsewhere on a large scale.  With [[Merovingian art]] the story of French styles as a distinct and influential element in the wider development of the art of Christian Europe begins.  

France can fairly be said to have been a leader in the development of [[Romanesque art]] and [[Gothic art]], before the [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] led to Italy becoming the main source of stylistic developments until France matched Italy's influence during the [[Rococo]] and [[Neoclassicism]] periods and then regained the leading role in the Arts from the 19th to the mid-20th century.

==Historic overview==

===Prehistory===
[[File:Venus of Brassempouy.jpg|thumb|left|Front and side view of the [[Venus of Brassempouy]].]]
Currently, the earliest known European art is from the [[Upper Palaeolithic]] period of between 40,000 and 10,000 years ago and France has a large selection of extant [[pre-historic art]] from the [[Châtelperronian]], [[Aurignacian]], [[Solutrean]], [[Gravettian]], and [[Magdalenian]] cultures. This art includes [[cave painting]]s, such as the famous paintings at [[Pech Merle]] in the [[Lot (département)|Lot]] in [[Languedoc]] which date back to 16,000 BC, [[Lascaux]], located near the village of [[Montignac, Dordogne|Montignac]], in the [[Dordogne]], dating back to between 13,000 and 15,000 BC, or perhaps, as far back as 25,000 BC, the [[Cosquer Cave]], the [[Chauvet Cave]] dating back to 29,000 BC, and the [[Trois-Frères|Trois-Frères cave]]; and [[portable art]], such as animal carvings and great goddess statuettes called [[Venus figurines]], such as the "[https://web.archive.org/web/20060904222320/http://www.musee-antiquitesnationales.fr/pages/page_id18159_u1l2.htm Venus of Brassempouy]" of 21,000 BC, discovered in the [[Landes (department)|Landes]], now in the museum at the [[Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] or the [[Venus of Lespugue]] at the [[Musée de l'Homme]]. Ornamental beads, bone pins, carvings, as well as flint and stone [[arrowhead]]s also are among the prehistoric objects from the area of France.

Speculations exist that only [[Homo sapiens]] are capable of artistic expression, however, a recent find, [[the Mask of La Roche-Cotard]]—a [[Mousterian]] or [[Neanderthal]] artifact, found in 2002 in a cave near the banks of the [[Loire River]], dating back to about [[Paleolithic|33,000 B.C.]]—now suggests that Neanderthal humans may have developed a sophisticated and complex artistic tradition.

[[File:Carnac megalith alignment 1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''The Menec alignments'', the most well-known megalithic site among the Carnac stones]]

In the [[Neolithic]] period (''see'' [[Neolithic Europe]]), [[megalith]]ic (large stone) monuments, such as the [[dolmen]]s and [[menhir]]s at [[Carnac stones|Carnac]], [[Saint-Sulpice-de-Faleyrens]] and elsewhere in France begin to appear; this appearance is thought to start in the fifth millennium BC, although some authors speculate about [[Mesolithic]] roots. In France there are some 5,000 megalithics monuments, mainly in Brittany, where there is the largest concentration of these monuments. In this area there is wide variety of these monuments that have been well preserved, like menhirs, dolmen, cromlechs and cairns. The [[Gavrinis|Cairn of Gavrinis]] in southern Brittany is an outstanding example of megalithic art : its 14 meters inner corridor is nearly completely adorned with ornamental carvings. The [[Broken Menhir of Er Grah|great broken menhir of Er-Grah]], now in four pieces was more than 20 meters high originally, making it the largest menhir ever erected. France has also numerous painted stones, polished stone axes, and inscribed menhirs from this period. The Grand-Pressigny area was known for its precious silex blades and they were extensively exported during the Neolithic.

In France from the Neolithic to the [[Bronze Age]], one finds a variety of archaeological cultures, including the [[Rössen culture]] of c. 4500–4000 BC, [[Beaker culture]] of c. 2800–1900 BC, [[Tumulus culture]] of c. 1600–1200 BC, [[Urnfield culture]] of c. 1300–800 BC, and, in a transition to the [[Iron Age]], [[Hallstatt culture]] of c. 1200–500 BC.

===Celtic and Roman periods===
[[File:Parade helmet.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Agris Helmet]]]]
From the [[Proto-Celtic]] Urnfield and Hallstat cultures, a continental [[Iron age]] [[Celtic art]] developed; mainly associated with [[La Tène culture]], which flourished during the late Iron Age from 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the first century BC. This art drew on native, classical and perhaps, the [[Mediterranean]], oriental sources. The Celts of [[Gaul]] are known through numerous tombs and burial mounds found throughout France.

Celtic art is very ornamental, avoiding straight lines and only occasionally using symmetry, without the imitation of nature nor ideal of beauty central to the [[Classicism|classical]] tradition, but apparently, often involves complex symbolism. This artwork includes a variety of styles and often incorporates subtly modified elements from other cultures, an example being the characteristic over-and-under interlacing which arrived in France only in the sixth century, although it was already used by [[Germany|Germanic]] artists. The Celtic [[Vix Grave|Vix grave]] in present-day Burgundy revealed the largest bronze crater of the Antiquity, that was probably imported by Celtic aristocrats from Greece.

[[File:Orange roman theatre.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Théâtre antique d'Orange]]]]
The region of Gaul ({{lang-la|Gallia}}) came under the rule of the [[Roman Empire]] from the first century BC to the fifth century AD. Southern France, and especially Provence and Languedoc, is known for its many intact Gallo-Roman monuments. [[Lugdunum]], modern Lyon, was at the time of the Roman Empire the largest city outside Italy and gave birth to two Roman Emperors. The city still boasts some Roman remains including a Theater. Monumental works from this period include the [[Théâtre antique d'Orange|amphitheater]] in [[Orange, Vaucluse]], the "[[Maison Carrée]]" at [[Nîmes]] which is one of the best preserved Roman temples in Europe, the city of [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]] near Lyon, which features an exceptionally well preserved temple (the temple of Augustus and Livia), a circus as well as other remains, the [[Pont du Gard]] [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] which is also in an exceptional state of preservation, the Roman cities of [[Glanum]] and [[Vaison-la-Romaine]], two intact Gallo-Roman arenas in [[Arena of Nîmes|Nîmes]] and [[Arles Amphitheatre|Arles]], and the [[Thermes de Cluny|Roman baths]], and the [[Arènes de Lutèce|arena]] of [[Paris]].

===Medieval period===

====Merovingian art====
{{Main|Merovingian art}}
Merovingian art is the art and architecture of the [[Merovingian]] dynasty of the [[Franks]], which lasted from the fifth century to the eighth century in present-day France and [[Germany]]. The advent of the Merovingian dynasty in [[Gaul]] during the fifth century led to important changes in the arts. In architecture, there was no longer the desire to build robust and harmonious buildings. Sculpture regressed to being little more than a simple technique for the ornamentation of [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]], [[altars]], and ecclesiastical furniture. On the other hand, the rise of [[goldsmith|gold work]] and [[Illuminated manuscript|manuscript illumination]] brought about a resurgence of [[Celt]]ic decoration, which, with [[Christian]] and other contributions, constitutes the basis of Merovingian art. The unification of the [[Franks|Frankish]] kingdom under [[Clovis I]] (465–511) and his successors, corresponded with the need to build churches. The plans for them probably were copied from [[Roman architecture|Roman]] [[basilica]]s. Unfortunately, these timber structures have not survived because of destruction by fire, whether accidental or caused by the [[Normans]] at the time of their incursions.

====Carolingian art====
{{Main|Carolingian art}}
[[File:Karolingischer Buchmaler um 820 001.jpg|thumb|Aachen Gospels, c. 820, an example of Carolingian [[Illuminated manuscript|illumination]]]]
Carolingian art is the approximate 120-year period from 750 to 900—during the reign of [[Charles Martel]], [[Pippin the Younger]], [[Charlemagne]], and his immediate heirs—popularly known as the [[Carolingian Renaissance]]. The Carolingian era is the first period of the Medieval art movement known as '''[[Pre-Romanesque art|Pre-Romanesque]]'''. For the first time, Northern European kings patronized classical Mediterranean Roman art forms, blending classical forms with Germanic ones, creating entirely new innovations in figurine line drawing, and setting the stage for the rise of [[Romanesque art]] and, eventually, [[Gothic art]] in the West.

Illuminated manuscripts, metalwork, small-scale sculpture, mosaics, and frescos survive from the period. The Carolingians also undertook major architectural building campaigns at numerous churches in France. These include, those of [[Metz]], [[Lyon]], [[Vienne]], [[Le Mans]], [[Reims]], [[Beauvais]], [[Verdun]], [[Saint-Germain in Auxerre]], Saint-Pierre in [[Flavigny Abbey|Flavigny]], and [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], as well as the town center of [[Chartres]]. The [[Centula Abbey]] of [[Saint-Riquier]] ([[Somme (department)|Somme]]), completed in 788, was a major achievement in monastic architecture. Another important building (mostly lost today) was "Theodulf's Villa" in [[Germigny-des-Prés]].

With the end of Carolingian rule around 900, artistic production halted for almost three generations. After the demise of the Carolingian Empire, France split into a number of feuding provinces, lacking any organized patronage. French art of the tenth and eleventh centuries was produced by local monasteries to promote literacy and piety, however, the primitive styles produced were not so highly skilled as the techniques of the earlier Carolingian period.

Multiple regional styles developed based on the chance availability of Carolingian manuscripts as models to copy, and the availability of itinerant artists. The monastery of Saint Bertin became an important center under its abbot Odbert (986–1007), who created a new style based on Anglo-Saxon and Carolingian forms. The nearby [[St. Vaast's Abbey|abbey of St. Vaast]] (Pas-de-Calais) also created a number of important works. In southwestern France a number of manuscripts were produced c. 1000, at the monastery of [[Saint Martial]] in [[Limoges]], as well as at [[Albi]], [[Figeac]], and [[Saint-Sever-de-Rustan]] in [[Gascony]]. In Paris a unique style developed at the [[abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Prés]]. In [[Normandy]] a new style arose in 975. By the later tenth century with the [[Cluny]] reform movement and a revived spirit for the concept of Empire, art production resumed.

[[File:Basilique de Vézelay Narthex Tympan central 220608.jpg|thumb|right|Central tympanum of the narthex of the [[Vézelay Abbey]] in [[Vézelay]], 1140–1150]]

====Romanesque art====
{{Main|Romanesque art}}
[[Romanesque art]] refers to the art of Western Europe during a period of one hundred and fifty years, from approximately 1000 AD to the rise of the [[Gothic Art|Gothic style]], which arose in the middle of the twelfth century in France. "Romanesque Art" was marked by a renewed interest in Roman construction techniques. For example, the twelfth-century capitals on the cloister of [[Saint-Guilhem-le-Désert]], adopt an [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]]-leaf [[Motif (art)|motif]] and the decorative use of drill holes, which were commonly found on Roman monuments. Other important Romanesque buildings in France include the abbey of [[Saint-Benoît-sur-Loire]] in [[Loiret]], the churches of [[Abbey Church of Saint Foy|Saint-Foy]] in [[Conques]] of [[Aveyron]], Saint-Martin in [[Tours]], Saint-Philibert in [[Tournus]] of [[Saône-et-Loire]], [[Abbey of Saint-Remi|Saint-Remi]] in [[Reims]], and [[Saint-Sernin Basilica|Saint-Sernin]] in [[Toulouse]]. In particular, [[Normandy]] experienced a large building campaign in the churches of [[Bernay, Eure|Bernay]], [[Mont-Saint-Michel]], [[Coutances Cathedral]], and [[Bayeux]].

[[File:Sainte Chapelle - Upper level 1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Interior of the Chapelle Haute, [[Sainte Chapelle]], Paris]]
Most Romanesque sculpture was integrated into church architecture, not only for aesthetic, but also for structural purposes. Small-scale sculpture during the pre-Romanesque period was influenced by [[Byzantine]] and [[Early Christian]] sculpture. Other elements were adopted from various local styles of Middle Eastern countries. Motifs were derived from the arts of the "barbarian," such as grotesque figures, beasts, and geometric patterns, which were all important additions, particularly in the regions north of the Alps. Among the important sculptural works of the period are the ivory carvings at the monastery of [[Abbey of St. Gall|Saint Gall]]. Monumental sculpture was rarely practised separately from architecture in the Pre-Romanesque period. For the first time after the fall of the Roman empire, monumental sculpture emerged as a significant art form. Covered church [[façades]], doorways, and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] all increased and expanded in size and importance, as in the [[Last Judgment]] [[tympanum (architecture)|Tympanum]], [[Beaulieu-sur-Dordogne]], and the Standing Prophet at [[Moissac]]. Monumental doors, baptismal fonts, and candle holders, frequently decorated with scenes from biblical history, were cast in bronze, attesting to the skills of the contemporary metalworkers. Frescoes were applied to the vaults and walls of churches. Rich textiles and precious objects in gold and silver, such as chalices and reliquaries, were produced in increasing numbers to meet the needs of the liturgy, and to serve the cult of the saints. In the twelfth century, large-scale stone sculpture spread throughout Europe. In the French Romanesque churches of [[Provence]], [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], and [[Aquitaine]], sculptures adorned the façades and statues were incorporated into the capitals.

====Gothic====
{{Main|Gothic art|Gothic architecture}}
Gothic art and architecture were products of a Medieval art movement that lasted about three hundred years. It began in France, developing from the Romanesque period in the mid-twelfth century. By the late fourteenth century, it had evolved toward a more secular and natural style known as, [[International Gothic]], which continued until the late fifteenth century, when it evolved further, into [[Renaissance art]]. The primary Gothic art media were [[sculpture]], [[panel painting]], [[stained glass]], [[fresco]], and [[illuminated manuscript]].

[[File:Cenral tympanum Chartres.jpg|thumb|right|The Western (Royal) Portal at Chartres Cathedral, ''c.'' 1145, these architectural statues are the earliest Gothic sculptures, a revolution in style and the models for a generation of sculptors]]
Gothic architecture was born in the middle of the twelfth century in [[Île-de-France]], when [[Abbot Suger]] built the abbey at [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|St. Denis]], ''c.'' 1140, considered the first Gothic building, and soon afterward, the [[Chartres Cathedral]], ''c.'' 1145. Prior to this, there had been no sculpture tradition in Île-de-France—so sculptors were brought in from [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], who created the revolutionary figures acting as columns in the Western (Royal) Portal of Chartres Cathedral (''see image'') —it was an entirely new invention in French art, and would provide the model for a generation of sculptors. Other notable Gothic churches in France include [[Cathédrale Saint-Étienne de Bourges|Bourges Cathedral]], [[Amiens Cathedral]], [[Notre-Dame of Laon|Notre-Dame de Laon]], [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]] in [[Paris]], [[Reims Cathedral]], the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in [[Paris]], [[Strasbourg Cathedral]].

The designations of styles in French Gothic architecture are as follows: Early Gothic, High Gothic, Rayonnant, and Late Gothic or "Flamboyant". Division into these divisions is effective, but debatable. Because Gothic cathedrals were built over several successive periods, and the artisans of each period not necessarily following the wishes of previous periods, the dominant architectural style often changed during the building of a particular building. Consequently, it is difficult to declare one building as belonging to certain era of Gothic architecture. It is more useful to use the terms as descriptors for specific elements within a structure, rather than applying it to the building as a whole.

The French ideas spread. Gothic sculpture evolved from the early stiff and elongated style, still partly Romanesque, into a spatial and naturalistic treatment in the late twelfth and early thirteenth century. Influences from surviving ancient Greek and Roman sculptures were incorporated into the treatment of drapery, facial expression, and pose of the Dutch-Burgundian sculptor, [[Claus Sluter]], and the taste for naturalism first signaled the end of Gothic sculpture, evolving into the classicistic Renaissance style by the end of the fifteenth century.

[[File:Enguerrand Quarton, Le Couronnement de la Vierge (1454).jpg|thumb|left|260px|[[Enguerrand Quarton]], ''The Coronation of the Virgin'', 1452–53]]
Painting in a style that may be called, "Gothic," did not appear until about 1200, nearly fifty years after the start of Gothic architecture and sculpture. The transition from Romanesque to Gothic is very imprecise and by no means clearly delineated, but one may see the beginning of a style that is more somber, dark, and emotional than the previous period. This transition occurs first in England and France around 1200, in Germany around 1220, and in Italy around 1300. Painting, the representation of images on a surface, was practiced during the Gothic period in four primary crafts, [[fresco]]s, [[panel painting]]s, [[manuscript illumination]], and [[stained glass]]. Frescoes continued to be used as the main pictorial narrative craft on church walls in southern Europe as a continuation of early Christian and Romanesque traditions. In the north, stained glass remained the dominant art form until the fifteenth century. At the end of the 14th century and during the 15th century French princely courts like those of the dukes of Burgundy, the duke of Anjou or the duke of Berry as well as the pope and the cardinals in Avignon employed renowned painters, like the [[Limbourg Brothers]], [[Barthélemy d'Eyck]], [[Enguerrand Quarton]] or [[Jean Fouquet]], who developed the so-called [[International Gothic]] style that spread through Europe and incorporated the new Flemish influence as well as the innovations of the Italian early Renaissance artists.

In the late fifteenth century, the French [[Italian Wars|invasion of Italy]] and the proximity of the vibrant [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] court, with its Flemish connections, brought the French into contact with the goods, paintings, and the creative spirit of the [[Northern Renaissance|Northern]] and [[Italian Renaissance]]. Initial artistic changes at that time in France were executed by Italian and Flemish artists, such as [[Jean Clouet]] and his son [[François Clouet]], along with the Italians, [[Rosso Fiorentino]], [[Francesco Primaticcio]], and [[Niccolò dell'Abbate]] of what is often called the first [[School of Fontainebleau]] from 1531. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] also was invited to France by François I, but other than the paintings which he brought with him, he produced little for the French king.

The art of the period from François I through Henri IV often is heavily inspired by late Italian pictorial and sculptural developments commonly referred to as [[Mannerism]], which is associated with the later works of [[Michelangelo]] as well as [[Parmigianino]], among others. It is characterized by figures which are elongated and graceful that rely upon visual [[rhetoric]], including the elaborate use of [[allegory]] and [[mythology]]. Perhaps the greatest accomplishment of the French Renaissance was the construction of the [[Châteaux of the Loire Valley]]. No longer conceived of as fortresses, such pleasure palaces took advantage of the richness of the rivers and lands of the Loire region and they show remarkable architectural skill.

====Baroque and Classicism====
{{main|French Baroque and Classicism}}
[[File:Nicolas Poussin - Et in Arcadia ego (deuxième version).jpg|thumb|left|250px|''[[Les Bergers d’Arcadie]]'' by Nicolas Poussin]]

The seventeenth century marked a golden age for French art in all fields.
In the early part of the seventeenth century, late [[Mannerism|mannerist]] and early [[Baroque]] tendencies continued to flourish in the court of [[Marie de Medici]] and [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]].
Art from this period shows influences from both the north of Europe, namely the Dutch and Flemish schools, and from Roman painters of the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Artists in France frequently debated the contrasting merits of [[Peter Paul Rubens]] with his Flemish baroque, voluptuous lines and colors to [[Nicolas Poussin]] with his rational control, proportion, Roman classicist baroque style. Another proponent of classicism working in Rome was [[Claude Gellée]], known as Le Lorrain, who defined the form of classical landscape.

Many young French painters of the beginning of the century went to Rome to train themselves and soon assimilated [[Caravaggio]]'s influence like [[Valentin de Boulogne]] and [[Simon Vouet]]. The later is credited with bringing the baroque in France and at his return in Paris in 1627 he was named first painter of the king. But French painting soon departed from the extravagance and naturalism of the Italian baroque and painters like [[Eustache Le Sueur]] and [[Laurent de La Hyre]], following Poussin example developed a classicist way known as "Parisian atticism", inspired by Antiquity, and focusing on proportion, harmony and the importance of drawing. Even Vouet, after his return from Italy, changed his manner to a more measured but still highly decorative and elegant style.
 
[[File:Georges de La Tour 009.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Georges de La Tour]], ''The Penitent Magdalene'', c. 1640.]]

But at the same time there was still a strong ''[[Caravaggisti]]'' Baroque school represented in the period by the amazing candle-lit paintings of [[Georges de La Tour]]. The wretched and the poor were featured in a [[Utrecht Caravaggisti|quasi-Dutch manner]] in the paintings by the three [[Le Nain]] brothers. In the paintings of [[Philippe de Champaigne]] there are both propagandistic portraits of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]' s minister [[Cardinal Richelieu]] and other more contemplative portraits of people in the Catholic [[Jansenist]] sect.

In architecture, architects like [[Salomon de Brosse]], [[François Mansart]] and [[Jacques Lemercier]] helped define the French form of the baroque, developing the formula of the urban [[hôtel particulier]] that was to influence all of Europe and strongly departed from the Italian equivalent, the [[palazzo]]. Many aristocratic castles were rebuilt in the new classic-baroque style, some of the most famous being [[château de Maisons|Maisons]] and [[château de Cheverny|Cheverny]], characterized by high roofs ''"à la française"'' and a form that retained the medieval model of the castle adorned with prominent towers.

From the mid to late seventeenth century, French art is more often referred to by the term "Classicism" which implies an adherence to certain rules of proportion and sobriety uncharacteristic of the Baroque, as it was practiced in most of the rest of Europe during the same period. Under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Baroque as it was practiced in Italy, was not in French taste, for instance, as [[Bernini]]'s famous proposal for redesigning the Louvre was rejected by Louis XIV.[[File:Le chateau de Vaux le Vicomte.jpg|left|thumb|260px|[[Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte]] by [[Louis Le Vau]].]] Through [[propaganda]], wars, and great architectural works, [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] launched a vast program designed for the glorification of France and his name. The [[Palace of Versailles]], initially a tiny hunting lodge built by his father, was transformed by Louis XIV into a marvelous palace for fêtes and parties, under the direction of architects [[Louis Le Vau]] (who had also built the [[château de Vaux-le-Vicomte]]) and [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]] (who built the [[Les Invalides|church of the Invalides]] in Paris), painter and designer [[Charles Le Brun]], and the landscape architect [[André Le Nôtre]] who perfected the rational form of the [[French garden]] that from Versailles spread in all of Europe.

For sculpture Louis XIV's reign also proved an important moment thanks to the King's protection of artists like [[Pierre Puget]], [[François Girardon]] and [[Charles-Antoine Coysevox]]. In Rome, [[Pierre Legros]], working in a more baroque manner, was one of the most influential sculptors of the end of the century.

====Rococo and Neoclassicism====
[[File:Salon de la princesse hotel de soubise.jpg|thumb|Boiseries of the ''Salon de la princesse'' by [[Germain Boffrand]], [[hôtel de Soubise]], Paris]]

{{Main|French Rococo and Neoclassicism}}

[[Rococo]] and [[Neoclassicism]] are terms used to describe the visual and plastic arts and architecture in Europe from the early eighteenth century to the end of the eighteenth century. In France, the death of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in 1715 lead to a period of freedom commonly called the [[Régence]]. Versailles was abandoned from 1715 to 1722, the young king Louis XV and the government led by the [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans|duke of Orléans]] residing in Paris. There a new style emerged in the decorative arts, known as ''rocaille'' : the asymmetry and dynamism of the baroque was kept but renewed in a style that is less rhetoric and with less pompous effects, a deeper research of artificiality and use of motifs inspired by nature. This manner used to decorate rooms and furniture also existed in painting. Rocaillle painting turned toward lighters subjects, like the "fêtes galantes", theater settings, pleasant mythological narratives and the female nude. Most of the times the moralising sides of myths or history paintings are omitted and the accent is put on the decorative and pleasant aspect of the scenes depicted. Paintings from the period show an emphasis more on color than drawing, with apparent brush strokes and very colorful scenes. Important French painters from this period include [[Antoine Watteau]], considered the inventor of the ''fête galante'', [[Nicolas Lancret]] and [[François Boucher]]. 
[[File:Jean-Honoré Fragonard - Inspiration.jpg|thumb|left|''Inspiration'' by [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]]]]

The [[Louis XV style]] of decoration, although already apparent at the end of the last reign, was lighter with pastel colors, wood panels, smaller rooms, less gilding, and fewer brocades; shells, garlands, and occasional Chinese subjects predominated. The [[Chantilly porcelain|Chantilly]], [[Vincennes porcelain|Vincennes]] and then [[Sèvres porcelain|Sèvres manufactures]] produced some of the finest porcelain of the time. The highly skilled ''[[ébéniste]]s'', cabinet-makers mostly based in Paris, created elaborate pieces of furniture with precious wood and bronze ornaments that were to be highly praised and imitated in all of Europe. The most famous are [[Jean-François Oeben]], who created the work desk of king Louis XV in Versailles, and [[Bernard II van Risamburgh]]. Rooms in ''châteaux'' and ''hôtels particuliers'' were more intimate than during the reign of Louis XIV and were decorated with rocaille style [[boiseries]] (carved wood pannels covering the walls of a room) conceived by architects like [[Germain Boffrand]] or ''ornemanistes'' (designers of decorative objects) like [[Juste-Aurèle Meissonnier]]. [[File:Place de la bourse.jpg|thumb|right|270px|[[Place de la Bourse]] in Bordeaux by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]]]]
The most prominent architects of the first half of the century were, apart Boffrand, [[Robert de Cotte]] and [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel]], who designed public squares like the [[place de la Concorde]] in Paris and the [[place de la Bourse]] in [[Bordeaux]] in a style consciously inspired by that of the era of Louis XIV. During the first half of the century, France replaced Italy as the artistic centre and main artistic influence in Europe and many French artists worked in other courts across the continent.

The latter half of the eighteenth century continued to see French preeminence in Europe, particularly through the arts and sciences, and the speaking the [[French language]] was expected for members of the European courts. The French academic system continued to produce artists, but some, such as [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]] and [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]], explored new and increasingly impressionist styles of painting with thick brushwork. Although the hierarchy of genres continued to be respected officially, [[Genre works|genre painting]], [[Landscape art|landscape]], [[portrait]], and [[still life]] were extremely fashionable. Chardin and [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]] were hailed for their still lives although this was officially considered the lowest of all genres in the hierarchy of painting subjects.
[[File:Prometheus Adam Louvre MR1745.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Prometheus'' by [[Nicolas-Sébastien Adam]]]]

One also finds in this period a ''Pre-romanticist'' aspect. [[Hubert Robert]]'s images of ruins, inspired by Italian cappricio paintings, are typical in this respect as well as the image of storms and moonlight marines by [[Claude Joseph Vernet]]. So too the change from the rational and geometrical ''French garden'' of [[André Le Nôtre]] to the ''English garden'', which emphasized artificially wild and irrational nature. One also finds in some of these gardens—curious ruins of temples—called "follies".

The last half of the eighteenth century saw a turn to [[Neoclassicism]] in France, that is to say a conscious use of Greek and Roman forms and [[iconography]]. This movement was promoted by intellectuals like Diderot, in reaction to the artificiality and the decorative essence of the ''rocaille'' style. In painting, the greatest representative of this style is [[Jacques-Louis David]], who, mirroring the profiles of Greek vases, emphasized the use of the profile. His subject matter often involved classical history such as the death of Socrates and Brutus. The dignity and subject matter of his paintings were greatly inspired by the works of [[Nicolas Poussin]] from the seventeenth century. Poussin and David were in turn major influences on [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres]]. Other important neoclassical painters of the period are [[Jean-Baptiste Greuze]] and [[Joseph-Marie Vien]]. Neoclassicism also penetrated decorative arts and architecture.
[[File:Jacques-Louis David - Oath of the Horatii - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Jacques-Louis David]], ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' (1786)]]
Architects like [[Claude-Nicolas Ledoux|Ledoux]] and [[Étienne-Louis Boullée|Boullée]] developed a radical style of neoclassical architecture based on simple and pure geometrical forms with a research of simetry and harmony, elaborating visionary projects like the complex of the [[Royal Saltworks at Arc-et-Senans|Saltworks of Arc-et-Senans]] by Ledoux, a model of an ideal factory developed from the rational concepts of the [[Enlightment philosophers|Enlightment]] thinkers.

===Modern period===

====19th century====
{{main|French art of the 19th century}}
The [[French Revolution]] and the [[Napoleonic wars]] brought great changes to the arts in France. The program of exaltation and myth making attendant to the Emperor [[Napoleon I of France]] was closely coordinated in the paintings of David, Gros and Guérin. [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] was the main figure of neoclassicism until the 1850s and a prominent teacher, giving priority to drawing over color. Meanwhile, [[Orientalism]], Egyptian motifs, the tragic [[anti-hero]], the wild landscape, the [[historical novel]], and scenes from the Middle Ages and the Renaissance—all these elements of [[Romanticism]]—created a vibrant period that defies easy classification. The most important romantic painter of the period was Eugène Delacroix, who had a successful public career and was the main opponent of Ingres. Before him, [[Théodore Géricault]] opened the path to romanticism with his monumental ''[[Raft of the Medusa]]'' exposed at the 1819 Salon. [[Camille Corot]] tried to escape the conventional and idealized form of landscape painting influenced by classicism to be more realist and sensible to atmospheric variations at the same time.

[[File:Eugène Delacroix - Le Massacre de Scio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' - Eugène Delacroix]]

Romantic tendencies continued throughout the century, both idealized landscape painting and [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] have their seeds in Romanticism. The work of [[Gustave Courbet]] and the [[Barbizon school]] are logical developments from it, as is the late nineteenth century [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] of such painters as [[Gustave Moreau]], the professor of [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Georges Rouault]], as well as [[Odilon Redon]].

[[Academic painting]] developed at the [[École des Beaux-Arts de Paris|Ecole des Beaux-Arts]] was the most successful with the public and the State : highly trained painters like [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], [[William Bouguereau]] and [[Alexandre Cabanel]] painted historical scenes inspired by the antique, following the footsteps of Ingres and the neoclassics. Though criticized for their conventionalism by the young avant-garde painters and critics, the most talented of the Academic painters renewed the historical genre, drawing inspiration from multiple cultures and techniques, like the Orient and the new framings made possible by the invention of photography

For many critics [[Édouard Manet]] wrote of the nineteenth century and the modern period (much as [[Charles Baudelaire]] does in poetry). His rediscovery of Spanish painting from the golden age, his willingness to show the unpainted canvas, his exploration of the forthright nude, and his radical brush strokes are the first steps toward Impressionism. [[Impressionism]] would take the [[Barbizon school]] one step farther, rejecting once and for all a belabored style and the use of mixed colors and black, for fragile transitive effects of light as captured outdoors in changing light (partly inspired by the paintings of [[J. M. W. Turner]] and [[Eugène Boudin]]). It led to [[Claude Monet]] with his cathedrals and haystacks, [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] with both his early outdoor festivals and his later feathery style of ruddy nudes, [[Edgar Degas]] with his dancers and bathers. Other important impressionists were [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Camille Pissarro]] and [[Gustave Caillebotte]].

After that threshold was crossed, the next thirty years became a litany of amazing experiments. [[Vincent van Gogh]], Dutch born, but living in France, opened the road to [[expressionism]]. [[Georges-Pierre Seurat|Georges Seurat]], influenced by color theory, devised a [[pointillism|pointillist]] technique that governed the Impressionist experiment and was followed by [[Paul Signac]]. [[Paul Cézanne]], a painter's painter, attempted a geometrical exploration of the world, that left many of his peers indifferent. [[Paul Gauguin]], a banker, found symbolism in [[Brittany]]  along [[Émile Bernard (painter)|Emile Bernard]] and then exoticism and primitivism in [[French Polynesia]]. These painters were referred to as [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionists]].  [[Les Nabis]], a movement of the 1890s, regrouping painters such as [[Paul Sérusier]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Édouard Vuillard]] and [[Maurice Denis]], was influenced by Gauguin's example in Brittany: they explored a decorative art in flat plains with the graphic approach of a Japanese print. They preached that a work of art is the end product and the visual expression of an artist's synthesis of nature in personal aesthetic metaphors and symbols. 
[[Henri Rousseau]], the self-taught dabbling postmaster, became the model for the naïve revolution.

====20th century====
{{Main|French art of the 20th century}}
[[File:Claude Monet - Rouen Cathedral, Facade (Sunset).JPG|thumb|175px|left|[[Claude Monet]], ''Rouen Cathedral, Facade (Sunset)'']]
The early years of the twentieth century were dominated by experiments in colour and content that [[Impressionism]] and [[Post-Impressionism]] had unleashed. The products of the far east also brought new influences.  At roughly the same time, [[Fauvism|Les Fauves]] ([[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Albert Marquet]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Henri Manguin]]) exploded into color, much like German [[Expressionism]].

The discovery of African tribal masks by [[Pablo Picasso]], a Spaniard living in Paris, lead him to create his ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'' of 1907. Working independently, Picasso and [[Georges Braque]] returned to and refined Cézanne's way of rationally comprehension of objects in a flat medium, their experiments in [[cubism]] also would lead them to integrate all aspects and objects of day-to-day life, [[collage]] of newspapers, musical instruments, cigarettes, wine, and other objects into their works. [[Cubism]] in all its phases would dominate paintings of Europe and America for the next ten years. (See the article on [[Cubism]] for a complete discussion.)

[[World War I]] did not stop the dynamic creation of art in France. In 1916 a group of discontents met in a bar in Zurich, the [[Cabaret Voltaire (Zürich)|Cabaret Voltaire]], and created the most radical gesture possible, the anti-art of [[Dada]]. At the same time, [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]] were exploring similar notions. At a 1917 art show in [[New York City|New York]], Duchamp presented a white porcelain urinal (''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'') signed ''R. Mutt'' as work of art, becoming the father of the ''[[Readymades of Marcel Duchamp|readymade]]''.

When [[Dada]] reached Paris, it was avidly embraced by a group of young artists and writers who were fascinated with the writings of [[Sigmund Freud]], particularly by his notion of the [[unconscious mind]]. The provocative spirit of Dada became linked to the exploration of the unconscious mind through the use of [[automatic writing]], chance operations, and, in some cases, altered states. The [[surrealism|surrealists]] quickly turned to painting and sculpture. The shock of unexpected elements, the use of [[Frottage (surrealist technique)|Frottage]], [[collage]], and [[decalcomania]], the rendering of mysterious landscapes and dreamed images were to become the key techniques through the rest of the 1930s.
[[File:Violin and Candlestick.jpg|175px|thumb|[[Georges Braque]], ''Violin and Candlestick'', 1910]]

Immediately after this war the French art scene diverged roughly in two directions. There were those who continued in the artistic experiments from before the war, especially surrealism, and others who adopted the new [[Abstract Expressionism]] and [[action painting]] from New York, executing them in a French manner using [[Tachism]] or [[L'art informel]]. Parallel to both of these tendencies, [[Jean Dubuffet]] dominated the early post-war years while exploring childlike drawings, graffiti, and cartoons in a variety of media.

The late 1950s and early 1960s in France saw art forms that might be considered ''[[Pop Art]]''. [[Yves Klein]] had attractive nude women roll around in blue paint and throw themselves at canvases. [[Victor Vasarely]] invented [[Op-Art]] by designing sophisticated optical patterns. Artists of the [[Fluxus]] movement such as [[Ben Vautier]] incorporated [[graffiti]] and found objects into their work. [[Niki de Saint-Phalle]] created bloated and vibrant plastic figures. [[Arman]] gathered together found objects in boxed or resin-coated assemblages, and [[César Baldaccini]] produced a series of large compressed object-sculptures. In May 1968, the radical youth movement, through their ''atelier populaire'', produced a great deal of poster-art protesting the moribund policies of president [[Charles de Gaulle]].

Many contemporary artists continue to be haunted by the horrors of the Second World War and the specter of the Holocaust. [[Christian Boltanski]]'s harrowing installations of the lost and the anonymous are particularly powerful.

'''Genetic use restriction technology''' ('''GURT'''), also known as '''terminator technology''' or '''suicide seeds''', is the name given to proposed methods for restricting the use of [[genetically modified food|genetically modified plants]] by activating some genes only in response to certain stimuli, in particular to cause second generation seeds to be infertile.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=A.|first=Jefferson, Richard|last2=Don|first2=Byth,|last3=Carlos|first3=Correa,|last4=Gerardo|first4=Otero,|last5=Calvin|first5=Qualset,|date=1999-04-30|title=Genetic use restriction technologies|url=https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1477499|journal=Zenodo|language=en|doi=10.5281/zenodo.1477499}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://edepot.wur.nl/39033 Retrieved October 18 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The technology was originally developed under a cooperative research and development agreement between the [[Agricultural Research Service]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] and Delta and Pine Land company in the 1990s, but it is not yet commercially available.&lt;ref name="ISF"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldseed.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Genetic_Use_Restriction_Technologies_20030611_En1.pdf |author=www.worldseed.org, International Seed Federation|title=Genetic Use Restriction Technologies (Bangalore, June 2003)}} (Position Paper Supporting V-GURT development)&lt;/ref&gt;

The technology was first reported on by the Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) to the UN [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and discussed during the 8th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] in [[Curitiba]], Brazil, March 20–31, 2006.

== Process ==
[[File:GURT process diagram.png|thumb|upright=1.5|One type of GURT process uses biological signals to directly make certain enzymes.]]

Because of the continued development of the technology and the nature of patents that develop it, most descriptions of GURT differ from others. Still, all GURTs feature similar processes.&lt;ref name="GURT use"/&gt; The process is typically composed of four genetic components: a target gene, a promoter, a trait switch, and a genetic switch, sometimes with slightly different names in different papers. 

In one variation, a plant with GURT technology has in its [[DNA]] a target gene separated from a certain promoter gene by a blocker sequence. When a chosen external input is received by the plant, a genetic switch in the plant takes the input, amplifies it, and converts it into a biological signal. Next, the trait switch receives the signal and creates an [[enzyme]] that cuts the blocker sequence out. When the blocker sequence is eliminated, the promoter gene is able to cause the target gene to express itself in the plant.&lt;ref name="GURT use"&gt; Yi Sang Reginald J. Millwood C. Neal Stewart Jr. [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/pbi.12084 "Gene use restriction technologies for transgenic plant bioconfinement"] 04 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biofortified.org/2015/12/gmos-and-patents-part-1-terminator-genes/ Retrieved 19 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In a different version of the technology, an operator must bind to the trait switch in order for it to make the enzymes that cut out the blocker sequence. However, there are repressors that bind to the trait switch and prevent it from doing so. In this case, when the external input is applied, the repressors bond to it instead of the trait switch, allowing for the enzymes to be created that cut the blocker sequence, and the trait is expressed.&lt;ref name="GURT review"&gt;Luca Lombardo. [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/pbi.12242 "Genetic use restriction technologies: a review"] 17 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Other variations of GURT range widely, including systems such as letting the genetic switch directly affect the blocker sequence and bypass the need for a trait switch.&lt;ref name="GURT review"/&gt;

== Variants ==
There are conceptually two types of GURT.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Heffer.

FAO Plant Production and Protection Paper 168.  Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jefferson&gt;Jefferson RA et al.

Expert paper, prepared for the Secretariat on 30 April 1999&lt;/ref&gt; V-GURTs were developed first, with patents ranging throughout the 1990s, while T-GURTS were developed later and are sometimes considered the second generation of V-GURTS.&lt;ref name="GURT review"/&gt; The differences between the two types of GURT mainly rely on what the target gene does when it is activated.

=== Variety specific ===
Variety specific genetic use restriction technologies (V-GURT) produce sterile seeds, so the seed from the crop could not be used as seeds, but only for sale as food or fodder.&lt;ref name="ISF" /&gt; When a plant reaches a given reproductive stage in its cycle, the process of activating the target gene begins. In V-GURTs, the target gene is known as a disrupter gene, and is usually a [[cytotoxin]] that degrades the DNA or [[RNA]] of the plant. This results in a non-functioning seed that cannot grow into a plant.&lt;ref name="GURT use"/&gt; V-GURTs would not have an immediate impact on the large number of primarily western farmers who use [[hybrid seed]]s, as they do not produce their own planting seeds, and instead buy specialized hybrid seeds from seed production companies. However, currently around 80 percent of farmers in both Brazil and Pakistan grow crops based on saved seeds from previous harvests.&lt;ref name="ipsnews.net"&gt;Haider Rizvi, [http://www.ipsnews.net/2006/03/biodiversity-dont-sell-suicide-seeds-activists-warn/ "BIODIVERSITY: Don't Sell "Suicide Seeds", Activists Warn"], Inter Press Service News Agency, March 21, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Consequentially, resistance to the introduction of GURT technology into developing countries is strong.&lt;ref name="ipsnews.net" /&gt; The technology is restricted at the plant variety level, hence the term V-GURT.

=== Trait specific ===
Trait specific genetic use restriction technologies (T-GURT) are a second type of GURT that would modify a crop in such a way that the genetic enhancement engineered into the crop does not function until the plant is treated with a specific chemical.&lt;ref name="canada"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inspection.gc.ca/plants/plants-with-novel-traits/general-public/gurts/eng/1337406710213/1337406801948 |title= Genetic Use Restriction Technologies (GURTs)}} Retrieved October 17 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISF" /&gt; The chemical acts as the external input, activating the target gene. One difference in T-GURTs is the possibility that the gene could be toggled on and off with different chemical inputs, resulting in the same toggling on or off an associated trait. With T-GURTs, seeds could possibly be saved for planting with a condition that the new plants do not get any enhanced traits unless the external input is added. The technology is restricted at the trait level, hence the term T-GURT.

==Potential uses==
There are several proposed uses for GURTs that could benefit both businesses and farms. 

Non-viable seeds produced on V-GURT plants may reduce the propagation of [[Volunteer (botany)|volunteer plants]]. Volunteer plants can become an economic problem for larger-scale mechanized farming systems that incorporate [[crop rotation]].&lt;ref name="ISF"/&gt; Furthermore, under warm, wet [[harvest]] conditions non V-GURT grain can sprout, lowering the quality of grain produced. It is likely that this problem would not occur with the use of V-GURT grain varieties.&lt;ref name="ISF"/&gt; Use of V-GURT technology could also prevent escape of [[transgene]]s into wild relatives and help lessen impacts on [[biodiversity]]. Crops modified to produce non-food products could be armed with GURT technology to prevent accidental transmission of these traits into crops meant for foods.&lt;ref name="ISF"/&gt;

One of the original proposed uses for GURTs was to use them as alternatives to keep farmers from reusing patented seeds in the case that typical biological patents do not exist or are not enforced.&lt;ref name="ISF"/&gt; The use of T-GURTs by companies has been proposed to allow for the selling of a traditional seed that gets special functions only when sprayed with a certain activator chemical sold by the company.&lt;ref name="canada"/&gt;

==Controversy==
As of 2006, GURT seeds have not been commercialized anywhere in the world due to opposition from farmers, consumers, [[indigenous peoples]], [[Non-Governmental Organization|NGOs]], and some governments. Using the technology, companies that manufacture genetic use restriction technologies could potentially be able to make much more revenue because the seeds sold would not be able to be resown. Another concern is that farmers purchasing the seeds would be greatly impacted, given that would have to buy new seeds every year. It has been argued that this would result in higher prices in food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethique.gouv.qc.ca/en/assets/documents/OGM/TRUG/TRUG-avis-EN.pdf|title=An Ethical Examination of Genetic Use Restriction Technologies|date=November 20, 2008|access-date=June 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; GURT seeds are worried to cause a significant decrease in biodiversity and threaten native species of plants.&lt;ref&gt;https://intercontinentalcry.org/women-are-on-the-frontlines-of-a-race-against-time-to-save-native-seeds/ Retrieved October 17 2018&lt;/ref&gt; However, proponents of the technology dispute these claims, making the cases that because non-GMO hybrid plants are used in the same way and GURT seeds could help farmers deal with cross pollination, the benefits outweigh the potential negatives.&lt;ref&gt;https://fafdl.org/gmobb/the-myth-and-reality-of-terminator-seeds/ Retrieved October 17 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity recommended a ''de facto'' [[Moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on field-testing and commercial sale of terminator seeds; the moratorium was re-affirmed and the language strengthened in March 2006, at the COP8 meeting of the UNCBD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.banterminator.org/Glossary/Moratorium |title=Moratorium |publisher=Ban Terminator |accessdate=12 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216165017/http://www.banterminator.org/Glossary/Moratorium |archivedate=16 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the moratorium recommended that, due to a lack of research on the technology's potential risks, no field testing of GURTs nor products using them should be allowed until there was a sufficiently justified reason to do so. [[India]] and [[Brazil]] have passed national laws to prohibit the technology.&lt;ref name="ipsnews.net"/&gt;

An ecological niche is defined as the role an organism plays in its community, i.e. decomposer, primary producer, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ecological-niche|title=the definition of ecological niche|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guilds are defined according to the locations, attributes, or activities of their component species. For example, the mode of acquiring nutrients, the mobility, and the habitat zones that the species occupy or exploit can be used to define a guild. The number of guilds occupying an ecosystem is termed its ''disparity''. Members of a guild within a given ecosystem could be competing for resources, such as space or light, while cooperating in resisting wind stresses, attracting pollinators, or detecting predators, such as happens among savannah-dwelling [[antelope]] and [[zebra]].

A guild does not typically have strict, or even clearly defined boundaries, nor does it need to be taxonomically cohesive. A broadly defined guild will almost always have constituent guilds; for example, grazing guilds will have some species that concentrate on coarse, plentiful forage, while others concentrate on low-growing, finer plants. Each of those two sub-guilds may be regarded as guilds in appropriate contexts, and they might, in turn, have sub-guilds in more closely selective contexts. Some authorities even speak of guilds in terms of a [[fractal]] resource model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ritchie | first = Mark E.| title = Scale, Heterogeneity, and the Structure and Diversity of Ecological Communities.

An ecological guild is not to be confused with a [[taxocene]], a group of phylogenetically related organisms in a community that do not necessarily share the same or similar niches (for example, "the insect community"). Nor is a guild the same as a [[trophic species]], organisms of the same species that have mutual predators and prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dunne|first=Jennifer A.|last2=Williams|first2=Richard J.|last3=Martinez|first3=Neo D.|date=2002-10-01|title=Food-web structure and network theory: The role of connectance and size|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/99/20/12917|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=99|issue=20|pages=12917–12922|doi=10.1073/pnas.192407699|issn=0027-8424|pmc=130560|pmid=12235364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10772">{{About|the scientific names of plants and fungi|the equivalent naming of animals|Trinomen|the names of cultivated plants|International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants}}

In [[botany]], an '''infraspecific name''' is the [[scientific name]] for any [[taxon]] below the [[rank (taxonomy)|rank]] of [[species (biology)|species]], i.e. an '''infraspecific taxon'''. (A "taxon", plural "taxa", is a group of organisms to be given a particular name.) The scientific names of botanical taxa are regulated by the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' (ICN).&lt;ref name=icb&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This specifies a 'three part name' for infraspecific taxa, plus a 'connecting term' to indicate the rank of the name.&lt;ref name=icb24&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 24&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a name is ''Astrophytum myriostigma'' subvar. ''glabrum'', the name of a subvariety of the species ''[[Astrophytum myriostigma]]'' (bishop's hat cactus).

Names below the rank of species of cultivated kinds of plants and of animals are regulated by different codes of nomenclature and are formed somewhat differently.

==Construction of infraspecific names==

Article 24 of the ICN describes how infraspecific names are constructed.&lt;ref name="icb24"/&gt; The order of the three parts of an infraspecific name is:
:genus name, specific epithet, connecting term indicating the rank (not part of the name, but required), infraspecific epithet.
It is customary to italicize all three parts of such a name, but not the connecting term.&lt;ref&gt;See the examples in {{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 24&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
* ''Acanthocalycium klimpelianum'' var. ''macranthum''
:genus name = ''Acanthocalycium'', specific epithet = ''klimpelianum'', connecting term = var. (short for "varietas" or [[variety (botany)|variety]]), infraspecific epithet = ''macranthum''

*''Astrophytum myriostigma'' subvar. ''glabrum''
:genus name = ''Astrophytum'', specific epithet = ''myriostigma'', connecting term = subvar. (short for "subvarietas" or subvariety), infraspecific epithet = ''glabrum''

The recommended abbreviations for ranks below species are, for example:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 4; abbreviations from Recommendation 5A&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[subspecies]] - recommended abbreviation: subsp. (but "ssp." is also in use although not recognised by Art 26)
* varietas ([[variety (botany)|variety]]) - recommended abbreviation: var.
* subvarietas ([[subvariety]]) -  recommended abbreviation: subvar.
* forma ([[form (botany)|form]]) -  recommended abbreviation: f.
* subforma (subform) -  recommended abbreviation: subf.

== Abbreviation of infraspecific names ==

Like specific epithets, infraspecific epithets cannot be used in isolation as names.&lt;ref name=icbn241&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 24.1&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the name of a particular species of ''Acanthocalycium'' is ''Acanthocalycium klimpelianum'', which can be abbreviated to ''A. klimpelianum'' where the context makes the genus clear. The species cannot be referred to as just ''klimpelianum''. In the same way, the name of a particular variety of ''Acanthocalycium klimpelianum'' is ''Acanthocalycium klimpelianum'' var. ''macranthum'', which can be abbreviated to ''A. k.'' var. ''macranthum'' where the context makes the species clear. The variety cannot be referred to as just ''macranthum''.

Sometimes more than three parts will be given; strictly speaking, this is not a name, but a [[Scientific classification|classification]]. The ICN gives the example of ''Saxifraga aizoon'' var. ''aizoon'' subvar. ''brevifolia'' f. ''multicaulis'' subf. ''surculosa''; the name of the subform would be ''Saxifraga aizoon'' subf. ''surculosa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 24.1, Ex. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legitimate infraspecific names==

For a proposed infraspecific name to be legitimate it must be in accordance with all the rules of the ICN.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Appendix VII Glossary of terms used and defined in this Code, entry for "legitimate"&lt;/ref&gt; Only some of the main points are described here.

A key concept in botanical names is that of a [[type (biology)|type]]. In many cases the type will be a particular preserved specimen stored in a [[herbarium]], although there are other kinds of type. Like other names, an infraspecific name is attached to a type. Whether a plant should be given a particular infraspecific name can then be decided by comparing it to the type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no requirement for a species to be divided into infraspecific taxa, of whatever rank; in other words, a species does not have to have subspecies, varieties, forms, etc. However, if infraspecific ranks are created, then the name of the type of the species must repeat the specific epithet as its infraspecific epithet. The type acquires this name automatically as soon as any infraspecific rank is created.&lt;ref name=icbn26&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 26&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, consider ''[[Poa secunda]]'' &lt;small&gt;J.Presl&lt;/small&gt;, whose type specimen is in the Wisconsin State Herbarium.&lt;ref name=wsh&gt;{{Citation |title=Wisconsin Botanical Information System: Type Specimens |publisher=Wisconsin State Herbarium, University of Wisconsin |url=http://www.botany.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/searchspecimen.cgi?typeSpecimen=1 |accessdate=2011-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As soon as a subspecies of ''Poa secunda''  was created, then the type specimen of ''P. secunda''  immediately became the type specimen of ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''secunda''. The name "''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''secunda''" was automatically created (it is an "autonym"). Soreng created the subspecies ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''juncifolia'' (whose type specimen is also in the Wisconsin State Herbarium),&lt;ref name=wsh/&gt; thereby making the type specimen of ''P. secunda'' also the type specimen of ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''secunda''.
* If in addition to the subspecies any variety of ''Poa secunda'' were to be created, then the type specimen of ''P. secunda''  would automatically become the type specimen of ''Poa secunda'' var. ''secunda''. The type specimen would then have the classification ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''secunda'' var. ''secunda''.

The same epithet can be used again within a species, at whatever level, only if the names with the re-used epithet are attached to the same type.&lt;ref name=icbn26/&gt; Thus there can be a form called ''Poa secunda'' f. ''juncifolia'' as well as the subspecies ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''juncifolia'' if, and only if, the type specimen of ''Poa secunda'' f. ''juncifolia'' is the same as the type specimen of ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''juncifolia'' (in other words, if there is a single type specimen whose classification is ''Poa secunda'' subsp. ''juncifolia'' f. ''juncifolia'').

If two infraspecific taxa which have different types are accidentally given the same epithet, then a [[Homonym (biology)|homonym]] has been created. The earliest published name is the legitimate one and the other must be changed.&lt;ref name=icbn53&gt;{{Harvnb|McNeill|2012}}, Art. 53.4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifying authors==
When indicating authors for infraspecific names, it is possible to show either just the author(s) of the final, infraspecific epithet, or the authors of both the specific and the infraspecific epithets.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Examples:

*''Adenia aculeata'' subsp. ''inermis'' de Wilde
:This identifies de Wilde as the author who published this name for the subspecies (i.e. who created the epithet ''inermis''). Note that here it was decided not to indicate authority for the species.
*''Pinus nigra'' J.F.Arnold subsp. ''salzmannii'' (Dunal) Franco
:Here, J.F.Arnold is the author who gave the species, [[European black pine]], its botanical name ''Pinus nigra''; Dunal is the author who was the first to publish the epithet ''salzmanii'' for this taxon (as the species ''Pinus salzmanii''); Franco is the author who reduced the taxon to a subspecies of ''Pinus nigra''.

==Difference from zoological nomenclature==
In [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|zoological nomenclature]], names of taxa below species rank are formed somewhat differently, using a [[trinomen]] or 'trinomial name'. No connecting term is required as there is only one rank below species, the [[subspecies]].

==Cultivated plants==
The ''ICN'' does not regulate the names of cultivated plants, of [[cultivar]]s, i.e. plants specifically created for use in agriculture or horticulture. Such names are regulated by the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]'' (ICNCP).

Although logically below the rank of species (and hence "infraspecific"), a [[cultivar]] name may be attached to any scientific name at the genus level or below. The minimum requirement is to specify a genus name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brickell, C.D.; Alexander, C.; David, J.C.; Hetterscheid, W.L.A.; Leslie, A.C.; Malecot, V.; Jin, X.; Editorial committee; Cubey, J.J. |year=2009  |title=International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants (ICNCP or Cultivated Plant Code) incorporating the Rules and Recommendations for naming plants in cultivation, Eighth Edition, Adopted by the International Union of Biological Sciences International Commission for the Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants |publisher=International Association for Plant Taxonomy and International Society for Horticultural  Science   |url=http://www.actahort.org/chronica/pdf/sh_10.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Achillea'' 'Cerise Queen' is a cultivar; ''Pinus nigra'' 'Arnold Sentinel' is a cultivar of the species ''P.&amp;nbsp;nigra'' (which is propagated vegetatively, by [[cloning]]).

'''Instrumentation''' is a collective term for [[measuring instrument]]s used for indicating, measuring and recording physical quantities, and has its origins in the art and science of [[Scientific instrument|scientific instrument-making]]. 

The term '''instrumentation''' may refer to a device or group of devices used for direct reading [[thermometers]] or, when using many sensors, may become part of a complex [[industrial control system]] in such as manufacturing industry, vehicles and transportation. Instrumentation can be found in the household as well; a [[smoke detector]] or a heating [[thermostat]] are examples.

== History and development==
[[Image:Steuerstand01.jpg|thumb|A local instrumentation panel on a steam turbine.]]
The history of instrumentation can be divide into several phases. 
===Pre-industrial===
Elements of industrial instrumentation have long histories. Scales for comparing weights and simple pointers to indicate position are ancient technologies. Some of the earliest measurements were of time. One of the oldest [[water clock]]s was found in the tomb of the [[ancient Egypt]]ian pharaoh [[Amenhotep I]], buried around 1500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Early Clocks | url = https://www.nist.gov/pml/general/time/early.cfm | accessdate = 1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements were incorporated in the clocks. By 270 BCE they had the rudiments of an automatic control system device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Building automation history page | url = http://www.building-automation-consultants.com/building-automation-history.html | accessdate = 1 March 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110708104028/http://www.building-automation-consultants.com/building-automation-history.html | archivedate = 8 July 2011 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1663 [[Christopher Wren]] presented the Royal Society with a design for a "weather clock". A drawing shows meteorological sensors moving pens over paper driven by clockwork. Such devices did not become standard in meteorology for two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;

Available from Project Gutenberg.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has remained virtually unchanged as evidenced by pneumatic chart recorders, where a pressurized bellows displaces a pen. Integrating sensors, displays, recorders and controls was uncommon until the industrial revolution, limited by both need and practicality.

===Early industrial===
[[File:Analogue control loop evolution.png|thumb|The evolution of analogue control loop signalling from the pneumatic era to the electronic era.]]
Early systems used direct process connections to local control panels for control and indication, which from the early 1930s saw the introduction of pneumatic transmitters and automatic 3-term (PID) controllers.

The ranges of pneumatic transmitters were defined by the need to control valves and actuators in the field. Typically a signal ranged from 3 to 15 psi (20 to 100kPa or 0.2 to 1.0 kg/cm2) as a standard, was standardized with 6 to 30 psi occasionally being used for larger valves. 
Transistor electronics enabled wiring to replace pipes, initially with a range of 20 to 100mA at up to 90V for loop powered devices, reducing to 4 to 20mA at 12 to 24V in more modern systems. A [[transmitter]] is a device that produces an output signal, often in the form of a 4&amp;ndash;20&amp;nbsp;[[Ampere|mA]] electrical [[current (electrical)|current]] signal, although many other options using [[voltage]], [[frequency]], [[pressure]], or [[ethernet]] are possible. The [[Transistor#History|transistor]] was commercialized by the mid-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=704244&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D704244] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518092416/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=704244&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D704244|date=May 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instruments attached to a control system provided signals used to operate [[solenoid]]s, [[valve]]s, [[Regulator (automatic control)|regulators]], [[circuit breaker]]s, [[relay]]s and other devices. Such devices could control a desired output variable, and provide either remote or automated control capabilities.

Each instrument company introduced their own standard instrumentation signal, causing confusion until the 4-20&amp;nbsp;mA range was used as the standard electronic instrument signal for transmitters and valves. This signal was eventually standardized as ANSI/ISA S50, “Compatibility of Analog Signals for Electronic Industrial Process Instruments", in the 1970s. The transformation of instrumentation from mechanical pneumatic transmitters, controllers, and valves to electronic instruments reduced maintenance costs as electronic instruments were more dependable than mechanical instruments. This also increased efficiency and production due to their increase in accuracy. Pneumatics enjoyed some advantages, being favored in corrosive and explosive atmospheres.&lt;ref name=Anderson2&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automatic process control===
[[File:Industrial control loop.jpg|thumb|Example of a single industrial control loop; showing continuously modulated control of process flow.]]
In the early years of [[process control]], process indicators and control elements such as valves were monitored by an operator that walked around the unit adjusting the valves to obtain the desired temperatures, pressures, and flows. As technology evolved pneumatic controllers were invented and mounted in the field that monitored the process and controlled the valves. This reduced the amount of time process operators were needed to monitor the process. Later years the actual controllers were moved to a central room and signals were sent into the control room to monitor the process and outputs signals were sent to the final control element such as a valve to adjust the process as needed. These controllers and indicators were mounted on a wall called a control board. The operators stood in front of this board walking back and forth monitoring the process indicators. This again reduced the number and amount of time process operators were needed to walk around the units. The most standard pneumatic signal level used during these years was 3-15 psig.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;

===Large integrated computer-based systems===
[[Image:Pneumatische regelaar.jpg|thumb|Pneumatic "Three term" pneumatic [[PID controller]], widely used before electronics became reliable and cheaper and safe to use in hazardous areas (Siemens Telepneu Example)]]
[[File:Kontrollrom Tyssedal.jpg|thumb|A pre-DCS/SCADA era central control room. Whilst the controls are centralised in one place, they are still discrete and not integrated into one system.]] 
[[File:Leitstand 2.jpg|thumb|A DCS control room where plant information and controls are displayed on computer graphics screens. The operators are seated and can view and control any part of the process from their screens, whilst retaining a plant overview.]]
Process control of large industrial plants has evolved through many stages. Initially, control would be from panels local to the process plant. However this required a large manpower resource to attend to these dispersed panels, and there was no overall view of the process. The next logical development was the transmission of all plant measurements to a permanently-manned central control room. Effectively this was the centralisation of all the localised panels, with the advantages of lower manning levels and easier overview of the process. Often the controllers were behind the control room panels, and all automatic and manual control outputs were transmitted back to plant. 

However, whilst providing a central control focus, this arrangement was inflexible as each control loop had its own controller hardware, and continual operator movement within the control room was required to view different parts of the process. With coming of electronic processors and graphic displays it became possible to replace these discrete controllers with computer-based algorithms, hosted on a network of input/output racks with their own control processors. These could be distributed around plant, and communicate with the graphic display in the control room or rooms. The distributed control concept was born. 

The introduction of DCSs and [[SCADA]] allowed easy interconnection and re-configuration of plant controls such as cascaded loops and interlocks, and easy interfacing with other production computer systems. It enabled sophisticated alarm handling, introduced automatic event logging, removed the need for physical records such as chart recorders, allowed the control racks to be networked and thereby located locally to plant to reduce cabling runs, and provided high level overviews of plant status and production levels.

== Applications ==
In some cases the sensor is a very minor element of the mechanism. Digital cameras and wristwatches might technically meet the loose definition of instrumentation because they record and/or display sensed information. Under most circumstances neither would be called instrumentation, but when used to measure the elapsed time of a race and to document the winner at the finish line, both would be called instrumentation.

===Household===
A very simple example of an instrumentation system is a mechanical [[thermostat]], used to control a household furnace and thus to control room temperature. A typical unit senses temperature with a [[bi-metallic strip]]. It displays temperature by a needle on the free end of the strip. It activates the furnace by a [[mercury switch]]. As the switch is rotated by the strip, the mercury makes physical (and thus electrical) contact between electrodes.

Another example of an instrumentation system is a [[Burglar alarm|home security system]]. Such a system consists of 
sensors (motion detection, switches to detect door openings), simple algorithms to detect intrusion, local control (arm/disarm) and remote monitoring of the system so that the police can be summoned. Communication is an inherent part of the design.

Kitchen appliances use sensors for control.
*A refrigerator maintains a constant temperature by measuring the internal temperature.
*A microwave oven sometimes cooks via a heat-sense-heat-sense cycle until sensing done.
*An automatic ice machine makes ice until a [[Miniature snap-action switch|limit switch]] is thrown.
*Pop-up bread [[toaster]]s can operate by time or by heat measurements. 
*Some ovens use a temperature probe to cook until a target internal food temperature is reached.
*A common [[toilet]] refills the water tank until a float closes the valve. The float is acting as a water level sensor.

===Automotive===
Modern automobiles have complex instrumentation. In addition to displays of engine rotational speed and vehicle linear speed, there are also displays of battery voltage and current, fluid levels, fluid temperatures, distance traveled and feedbacks of various controls (turn signals, parking brake, headlights, transmission position). Cautions may be displayed for special problems (fuel low, check engine, tire pressure low, door ajar, seat belt unfastened). Problems are recorded so they can be reported to  [[Vehicle bus|diagnostic equipment]]. Navigation systems can provide voice commands to reach a destination. Automotive instrumentation must be cheap and reliable over long periods in harsh environments. There may be independent [[airbag]] systems which contain sensors, logic and actuators. [[Anti-lock braking system|Anti-skid]] braking systems use sensors to control the brakes, while [[cruise control]] affects throttle position. A wide variety of services can be provided via communication links as the [[OnStar]] system. [[Autonomous car]]s (with exotic instrumentation) have been demonstrated.

===Aircraft===
Early aircraft had a few sensors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cap-ny153.org/aircraftinstrumentation.htm Aircraft Instrumentation - Leroy R. Grumman Cadet Squadron&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; "Steam gauges" converted air pressures into needle deflections that could be interpreted as altitude and airspeed. A magnetic compass provided a sense of direction. The displays to the pilot were as critical as the measurements.

A modern aircraft has a far more sophisticated suite of sensors and displays, which are embedded into [[avionics]] systems. The aircraft may contain [[inertial navigation system]]s, [[global positioning system]]s, [[weather radar]], autopilots, and aircraft stabilization systems. Redundant sensors are used for reliability. A subset of the information may be transferred to a [[Event data recorder|crash recorder]] to aid mishap investigations. Modern pilot displays now include computer displays including [[head-up display]]s.

[[Air traffic control radar beacon system|Air traffic control radar]] is distributed instrumentation system. The ground portion transmits an electromagnetic pulse and receives an echo (at least). Aircraft carry transponders that transmit codes on reception of the pulse. The system displays aircraft map location, an identifier and optionally altitude. The map location is based on sensed antenna direction and sensed time delay. The other information is embedded in the transponder transmission.

===Laboratory instrumentation===
Among the possible uses of the term is a collection of laboratory test equipment controlled by a computer through an IEEE-488 bus (also known as GPIB for General Purpose Instrument Bus or HPIB for Hewlitt Packard Instrument Bus). Laboratory equipment is available to measure many electrical and chemical quantities. Such a collection of equipment might be used to automate the testing of drinking water for pollutants.

== Measurement parameters==
Instrumentation is used to measure many parameters (physical values). These parameters include:

== Instrumentation engineering ==
[[Image:Pump with tank pid en.svg|thumb|The instrumentation part of a [[Piping and instrumentation diagram]] will be developed by an instrumentation engineer.]] 
'''Instrumentation engineering''' is the engineering specialization focused on the principle and operation of measuring instruments that are used in design and configuration of automated systems in electrical, pneumatic domains etc and the control of quantities being measured.
They typically work for industries with [[automated]] processes, such as [[Chemical plant|chemical]] or [[manufacturing]] plants, with the goal of improving system [[productivity]], reliability, safety, optimization and stability.
To control the parameters in a process or in a particular system, devices such as microprocessors, microcontrollers or PLCs are used, but their ultimate aim is to control the parameters of a system.

Instrumentation engineering is loosely defined because the required tasks are very domain dependent. An expert in the biomedical instrumentation of laboratory rats has very different concerns than the expert in rocket instrumentation. Common concerns of both are the selection of appropriate sensors based on size, weight, cost, reliability, accuracy, longevity, environmental robustness and frequency response. Some sensors are literally fired in artillery shells. Others sense thermonuclear explosions until destroyed. Invariably sensor data must be recorded, transmitted or displayed. Recording rates and capacities vary enormously. Transmission can be trivial or can be clandestine, encrypted and low-power in the presence of jamming. Displays can be trivially simple or can require consultation with [[human factors]] experts. Control system design varies from trivial to a separate specialty.

Instrumentation engineers are responsible for integrating the sensors with the recorders, transmitters, displays or control systems, and producing the [[Piping and instrumentation diagram]] for the process. They may design or specify installation, wiring and signal conditioning. They may be responsible for calibration, testing and maintenance of the system.

In a research environment it is common for subject matter experts to have substantial instrumentation system expertise. An astronomer knows the structure of the universe and a great deal about telescopes - optics, pointing and cameras (or other sensing elements). That often includes the hard-won knowledge of the operational procedures that provide the best results. For example, an astronomer is often knowledgeable of techniques to minimize temperature gradients that cause air turbulence within the telescope.

Instrumentation technologists, technicians and mechanics specialize in troubleshooting, repairing and maintaining instruments and instrumentation systems.

=== Typical Industrial Transmitter Signal Types ===
[[Current loop|Current Loop (4-20mA)]] - Electrical

[[Hart Protocol|HART]] - Data signalling often overlaid on a current loop.

[[FOUNDATION Fieldbus|Foundation Fieldbus]] - Data signalling

[[Profibus]] - Data signalling

==Impact of modern development==
Ralph Müller (1940) stated "That the history of physical science is largely the history of instruments and their intelligent use is well known. The broad generalizations and theories which have arisen from time to time have stood or fallen on the basis of accurate measurement, and in several instances new instruments have had to be devised for the purpose. There is little evidence to show that the mind of modern man is superior to that of the ancients. His tools are incomparably better."&lt;ref name="Katz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Eric|last2=Light|first2=Andrew|last3=Thompson|first3=William|title=Controlling technology : contemporary issues|date=2002|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst, NY|isbn=978-1573929837|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nny8OoQCZCoC&amp;pg=PA88|accessdate=9 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baird"/&gt;{{rp|290}}

Davis Baird has argued that the major change associated with [[Floris Cohen]]{{'}}s identification of a "fourth big scientific revolution" after [[World War II]] is the development of scientific instrumentation, not only in [[chemistry]] but across the sciences.&lt;ref name="Baird"&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21926">In the height region between about 85 and 200&amp;nbsp;km altitude on Earth, the ionospheric plasma is electrically conducting. Atmospheric tidal winds due to differential  solar heating or due to gravitational lunar forcing move the ionospheric plasma against the [[geomagnetic field]] lines thus generating electric fields and currents just like a [[dynamo]] coil moving against magnetic field lines. That region is therefore called '''ionospheric dynamo region'''.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels&gt;Chapman , S.J. and J. Bartels, „Geomagnetism“ , Clarendon Press, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; 
The magnetic manifestation of these electric currents on the ground  can be observed during magnetospheric quiet conditions. They are called Sq-variations (S=solar; q=quiet) and L-variations  (L=lunar) of the geomagnetic field.
Additional electric currents are generated by the varying  [[magnetospheric electric convection field]]. These are the DP1-currents (the auroral electrojets) and the  polar DP2-currents.
&lt;ref name=Akasofu&gt;Akasofu, S.I., "Physics of Magnetospheric Substorms", Reidel, Dordrecht, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, a polar-ring current has been derived from the observations which depends on the polarity of the [[interplanetary magnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;Heppner, J.P., in Dyer, E.R. (ed), "Critical Problems of Magnetospheric Physics", Nat. Acad. Sci.,Washington, D.C., p. 107. 1972&lt;/ref&gt; These geomagnetic variations belong to the so-called external part of the [[geomagnetic field]]. Their amplitudes reach at most about 1% of the main internal [[geomagnetic field]] '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Atmospheric Electric Conductivity==
Radioactive material from the ground and galactic cosmic rays ionize a small fraction  of the atmospheric gas within the lower and middle atmosphere  and make the gas electrically conducting. Electrons quickly  attach to neutral particles forming negative ions. The positive ions are mostly singly charged. The electric conductivity depends on the mobility of the ions . That mobility  is proportional to the reciprocal air density. Thus, the electric conductivity increases almost  exponentially with altitude.  The ions move with the neutral gas making the conductivity [[isotropic]].&lt;ref&gt;Viggiano, A.A., and F. Arnold, in Volland, H. (ed), "Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics", Vol. 1, p. 1, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

At heights between about 85 and 200&amp;nbsp;km however -the dynamo region-, solar X- and extreme [[ultraviolet radiation]] (XUV) is almost completely absorbed  generating the ionospheric D-, E-, and F-layers.  Here, the electrons are already bound to the [[geomagnetic field]] gyrating several times about these lines before they collide with the neutrals, while the positive ions still essentially move with the neutral gas. Thus, the electric conductivity becomes [[anisotropic]]. The conductivity parallel to an electric field  '''E'''  is called  [[Pedersen]] conductivity.  The conductivity orthogonal to '''E''' and the geomagnetic field '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;  is the [[Hall]] conductivity. Ohmic losses and thus [[Joule]] heating occur when Pedersen currents flow. The component parallel to '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;  still increases with altitude. Near the geomagnetic dip equator, a west-east directed electric field generates vertical Hall currents which cannot close. Therefore,  a vertical polarization field builds up generating a horizontal Hall current which adds to the Pedersen current. Such enhancement is described by the [[Cowling]] conductivity. Pedersen and Hall conductivities reach maximum values near 120 to 140&amp;nbsp;km  altitudes with numbers of about 1 mS/m during sunlit conditions. During the night, these numbers may decrease by a factor of ten or more. The values of  these conductivities depend on local time, latitude, season and solar 11- year cycle. The height integrated conductivities become of the order of 50 S, or  a total resistance of the dynamo region of about 1/50 = 0.02 Ohm during daytime conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Fejer, A.A., Rev. Geophys., 2, 275, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

In the auroral regions which lie between about 15° and 20° geomagnetic co-latitude and the corresponding latitudes in the southern hemisphere, precipitating high energy particles from the [[magnetosphere]] ionize the neutral gas, in particular at heights around 110 to 120&amp;nbsp;km, and increase the electric conductivity substantially. During magnetospheric disturbed conditions, this conductivity enhancement becomes much larger, and the auroral regions move equatorward.&lt;ref name=Akasofu/&gt;

At heights above about 200&amp;nbsp;km, collisions between neutrals and plasma become rare so that both ions and electrons can only gyrate about the geomagnetic lines of force, or drift orthogonal to '''E''' and '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. The parallel conductivity is so large that the geomagnetic lines of force become electric potential lines, and only electric fields orthogonal to '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; can exist (see [[magnetosphere]]).

==Atmospheric Tides==
'''Atmospheric tides''' are global-scale waves excited by regular solar differential heating (thermal tides)or by the gravitational [[tidal force]] of the moon (gravitational tides). The atmosphere behaves like a huge waveguide closed at the bottom (the Earth's surface) and open to space at the top. In such a waveguide an infinite number of atmospheric wave modes can be excited. Because the waveguide is imperfect, however, only  modes of lowest degree with large horizontal and vertical scales can develop sufficiently well so that they can be filtered out from the meteorological noise. They are solutions of the [[Laplace]] equation &lt;ref&gt;Longuet-Higgins, M.S., "The eigenfunctions of Laplace's tidal equations over a sphere", Phil. Trans. Roy. Soc.", London, A262, p. 511, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; and are called Hough functions. These can be approximated by a sum of [[spherical harmonics]].

Two kinds of wave modes exit: class 1 waves (sometimes called gravity waves), and class 2 waves (rotational waves). Class 2 waves owe their existence to the [[Coriolis effect]] and can only exist for periods larger than 12 hours. Tidal waves can be either internal (travelling waves ) with positive eigenvalues (or equivalent depth)  which have finite vertical wavelengths and can transport wave energy upward, or external (evanescent waves) with negative eigenvalues and infinitely large vertical wavelengths meaning that their phases remain constant with altitude. These external wave modes cannot transport wave energy, and their  amplitudes decrease exponentially with height outside their source regions. Each mode is characterized by four numbers: the zonal wave number n, positive for class 1 waves and negative for class 2 waves (their meridional structures becoming increasingly complex with increasing number n), a meridional wave number m, the eigenvalue, and the period, in our case one solar or [[lunar day]], respectively. The modes are labeled as (m, n). Even numbers of n correspond to waves symmetric with respect to the equator, and odd numbers corresponding to antisymmetric waves.

At thermospheric heighs, [[dissipation]] of atmospheric waves becomes significant so that at above about 150&amp;nbsp;km altitude, all wave modes gradually become external waves, and the [[Hough function]]s degenerate to [[spherical harmonics]]s; e.g., mode (1, -2) develops to the spherical harmonic P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(θ), mode (2, 2) becomes P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(θ), with θ the co-latitude, etc.&lt;ref name=VollandAT&gt;Volland, H., "Atmospheric Tidal and Planetary Waves", Kluwer Publ., Dordrecht, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

===Migrating Solar  Tides===
The fundamental solar diurnal tidal mode which optimally matches the solar heat input configuration and thus is most strongly excited is the (1,&amp;nbsp;-2) - mode. It depends on local time and travels westward with the Sun. It is an external mode of class 2. Its maximum pressure amplitude on the ground is about 60 hPa.&lt;ref name=ChapmanLindzen &gt;Chapman, S., and R.S. Lindzen, "Atmospheric Tides", Kluwer Dordrecht, 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[thermosphere]], however, it becomes the predominant mode reaching temperature amplitudes at the [[exosphere]] of at least 140 K  and horizontal winds of the order of  100&amp;nbsp;m/s and more increasing with geomagnetic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl, H. and J.W. King, J. Atm. Terr. Phys., 29,1045, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The largest solar semidiurnal wave is mode (2,&amp;nbsp;2) with maximum pressure amplitudes near the ground of 120&amp;nbsp; hPa. It is an internal class 1 wave. Its amplitude increases with altitude. Although its solar excitation is half of that of mode (1,&amp;nbsp;-2), its amplitude on the ground is larger by a factor of two. This indicates the effect of  suppression of external waves, in this case by a factor of four
.&lt;ref name=VollandAT/&gt;

===Semidiurnal Lunar Tides===
The dominant migrating lunar tide is the (2, 2) mode depending on lunar [[Time zone|local time]]. Its maximum pressure amplitude near the ground is 6 Pa, which is far below the meteorological noise. Therefore, it is not simple to detect such small signal.&lt;ref name=ChapmanLindzen /&gt; Because it is an internal waves, its amplitude increases with altitude reaching values at 100&amp;nbsp;km height two orders of magnitude larger than on the ground.

==Electric Currents==

===Sq-Current===

====Morphology====
More than 100 geomagnetic observatories around the world measure regularly the variations of the [[earth's magnetic field]]. The daily variations during selected days of quiet geomagnetic activity are used to determine a monthly mean. From the horizontal component ΔH of such data, one can derive a corresponding overhead equivalent electric sheet current system at dynamo layer heights of strength

J = 2 ΔH/μ = 1.6 ΔH

with J (in milliAmpere/meter) the electric overhead sheet current, ΔH (in nanoTesla) the observed horizontal component of the geomagnetic variation, and μ the electric permeability of free space.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels /&gt; One can determine the direction of the magnetic field with regard to the current by the simple rule of thumb: if the thumb of the right hand points into the direction of the current, the curved fingers give the direction of the associated magnetic field.

One has to take into account that this relationship is not unique. In general, electric currents within [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]] are three-dimensional, and an infinite number of current configurations fits to the geomagnetic variations observed on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Fukushima, N., Radio Sci., 6, 269, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  Magnetic measurement in space are necessary to obtain a realistic picture.

[[File:Sqcurrent.jpg|thumb|400px|Figure 1. Streamlines of equivalent ionospheric Sq current during equinox (1957 - 1969) at 12 UT separated into primary (a) and secondary (b) part. Between two streamlines flow 20 kA &lt;ref&gt;Malin, S.R.C., Phil Trans. R. Soc., London, Ser. A 274, 551,1973&lt;/ref&gt;&gt;]].
Figure 1a shows current streamlines of an equivalent Sq current as seen from the sun at noon. This current configuration is fixed to the sun, while the earth rotates beneath it. A total current of about 140 kA flows within one daytime vortex. The rotating Sq current and the electrically conducting earth interior behave like  a huge  transformer with the dynamo region as the primary winding and the earth as the secondary winding. Since the Sq current varies with the basic period of one day, electric currents are induced within the earth's interior. The magnetic field of this secondary current is superimposed on the magnetic field of the primary Sq current. Methods to separate  both components go back to [[Gauss]]. The amplitude of the secondary current is about 1/3 of that of the  primary current and slightly shifted in  phase. Figure 1b shows that secondary component. The ratio between sheet current and magnetic component given above has now simply the value one.

The Sq current depends on season. The summer [[vortex]] is intensified compared with the winter vortex and reaches into the winter hemisphere. A longitudinal dependence of the Sq current exists which is related to  the inclined dipole component of the internal magnetic field, but probably also to nonmigrating tidal waves from below.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, J.M., at all., J. Geophys. Res., Space Physics, 113, 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of the 11-year [[solar cycle]], the amplitude of Sq increases by a factor of more than two from sunspot minimum to sunspot maximum. Two thirds of this increase may result from the enhancement of the electric conductivity with solar activity. The rest is probably due to the increase of the wind speed caused by the temperature increase with increasing solar activity. During the night, the electron density of the ionospheric [[E-layer]] diminishes much more strongly than that of the [[F-layer]]. Therefore, the height center of the dynamo region shifts upward.&lt;ref&gt;Matsushita, S., and W.H. Campell, W.H. (eds.), "Physics of Geomagnetic Phenomena", Vol. I and II, Academic Press, New York,1967&lt;/ref&gt;

The main driver of the Sq current is the external (1, -2) tidal wave mode. Due to its constant phase with altitude, is most efficient to drive coherent winds at dynamo layer height,&lt;ref&gt;Kato, S., J. Geophys. Res., 71, 3211, 1966&lt;/ref&gt; while the currents generated by the internal modes interfere destructively at various heights.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, J.M., J. Geophys.Res. 87, 5222, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; A Fourier analysis shows a semidiurnal component with an amplitude of 1 /2 of that of the diurnal component, phase shifted by  180°. This appears to be the result of nonlinear coupling between the product of the diurnally varying wind and the diurnally varying conductivity  
.&lt;ref name=VollandAE&gt;Volland, H., "Atmospheric Electrodynamics", Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; 
The centers of the daytime vortices show a day to day variability. This can be attributed to the internal tidal modes which are sensitive to the varying meteorological conditions in the lower and in the middle atmosphere, in part also to solar activity.  
 
Near the dip equator (where the geomagnetic field lines are horizontal), a strong band of eastward flowing currents can be observed in a range of about 150&amp;nbsp;km from the equator
.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels/&gt; Such enhancement of the Sq current  by a factor of about four is due to the Cowling conductivity. 
During a [[solar flare]], bursts of [[solar radiation]] from the environment of an active  sunspot reach the higher atmosphere, mainly at E- and D- layer heights, lasting at most for one hour. The electric conductivity increases, and the Sq current enhances on the daytime hemisphere. A small increase  occurs, called geomagnetic solar flare effect or crochet.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, A.DF., and S.V. Venkatesmaran, J. Geophys. Res., 81, 139,1971&lt;/ref&gt; During  a [[solar eclipse]], the electric conductivity decreases in the shadow region, and the Sq current and thus the Sq variation diminishes by a few nT in that area.&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, C.U., J. Atm. Terr. Phys., 25,529,1963&lt;/ref&gt; It is called a geomagnetic solar eclipse effect. Both events can be observed only during quiet geomagnetic activity.
 
In the aftermath of strong magnetospheric disturbances, a current system develops into a quasi 
anti-Sq-current. It is generated by Joule heating in the polar [[thermosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Blanc, M., and A.D. Richmond, J. Geophys. Res., 85, 1669, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaka, K,.Z., et all., Ann. Geophys., 27, 3523, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; This current system is called Ddyn.

====Theory====
[[File:Sqblockdiagram.jpg|thumb|300px|Figure 2. Blockdiagram illustrating coupling between the horizontal wind '''U''' and pressure p via the Ampere force '''j'''x '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, and the Lorentz force '''U'''x '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. Here '''j''' is the electric current density, '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; the geomagnetic field, h the equivalent depth, σ the electric conductivity, and '''E''' the electric polarization field. In a self-consistent treatment of the coupled system, gate B must be closed. In conventional dynamo theories, gate B is open.]]
In order to determine quantitatively the dynamo action of the neutral wind '''U''', one starts with the horizontal momentum equation of the wind together with  an equation for the divergence of the wind. The momentum equation balances the inertial force, the Coriolis force, and the horizontal gradient of pressure p.&amp;nbsp;In addition, the Ampere force '''J'''x '''B'''&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; couples the electric  current density '''j''' to the wind and pressure system. The equivalent depth h (the eigenvalue of the tidal mode) determines the divergence of the wind. The electric current must obey [[Ohm]]'s law. An electric polarization field  '''E''' is generated by charge separation to enforce the condition of no sources and sinks of the current. Feedback between wind and electric current occurs via the Lorentz force '''U'''x '''B'''. Usually, the  electric conductivity tensor '''σ''' is considered as a given data set, and a height integrated conductivity tensor '''Σ'''  and a height integrated sheet current  '''J''' are applied.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, A.D., Geomagn. and Geoelectr. 31, 287,1979&lt;/ref&gt;

In conventional models, the Ampere force is neglected. This means that gate B in Figure 2 is open. This is called a kinematic dynamo. Models with closed gate B are called  hydromagnetic dynamos. The influence of the mutual coupling between wind and current can immediately be seen if one considers an infinitely large electric conductivity σ. In the kinematic model, the electric current would become infinitely large, while the wind amplitude remains constant. In the hydromagnetic model, the current reaches an upper limit, similar to a technical dynamo during short circuit, while the wind amplitude breaks down to a fraction of its original value. Charge separation acts like a self-impedance preventing the current to become infinitely large.&lt;ref name=VollandAE/&gt;

===L-Current===
Lunar (L) currents are weaker by a factor of about 20 than the Sq currents. The dominant wind component to drive these currents is the (2, 2) tidal mode. The L current is similar in shape as the Sq current, with the difference that four vortices instead of two exit. In each vortex a total current of about 4 kA flows. The seasonal variation of L is similar to that of Sq. During sunlit hours, L is strongly enhanced, while it approaches zero during the night. Thus, the L current exhibits, in addition, a  modulation depending on the lunar phase.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels/&gt; The geomagnetic effect of the L-current can best been seen near the dip equator where the [[Cowling]] conductivity strongly enhances that current.&lt;ref name=ChapmanBartels/&gt;

===DP1-Current===
Interaction between [[solar wind]] plasma and the polar [[geomagnetic field]] produces a global-scale [[magnetospheric electric convection field]] directed from dawn to dusk  with a potential difference of  about 15 kV during quiet magnetospheric conditions, increasing substantially during disturbed conditions. Charge separation takes place at the [[magnetopause]]. This area is connected with the ionospheric dynamo region via the first open geomagnetic field lines with one footpoint within the auroral regions. Thus, electric discharging currents can flow via field-aligned currents as two small bands within the auroral zone dynamo layer, on the daytime as well as on the nighttime hemisphere. These currents are called DP1 current or auroral electrojets. Their magnitudes  are of the order of Mega Amperes.&lt;ref name=Akasofu/&gt; Ohmic losses and thus Joule heating of these currents is comparable with that due to the solar XUV heat input within middle and lower latitudes during quiet conditions and much larger during disturbed conditions. Therefore, it dominates ionospheric and thermospheric dynamics and causes [[ionospheric]] and thermospheric storms &lt;ref&gt;Proelss, G.W., in  Volland, H. (ed), "Handbook of Atmospheric Electrodynamics", Vol. II, p.195, CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Proelss, G. W., Surv. Geophys. 32, 101, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===DP2-Current===
The [[magnetospheric electric convection field]] drives a two cell current within the polar cup  with their vortices situated on the morning and on the evening side. It is called DP2 current. That current exists already during quiet conditions  (S&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;) and becomes enhances during disturbed conditions. It is mainly composed of electric  Hall currents.&lt;ref name= ChapmanBartels/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nishida, A., and S. Kokubun, Rev. Geophys. Space Sci., 9, 417,1971&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polar-Ring Current===
If the azimuthal  component of the [[interplanetary magnetic field]]  (IMF) is directed toward dusk, the magnetospheric plasma is slowed down in the northern polar cap and accelerated in the southern polar cap. If the azimuthal component of the IMF is directed toward dawn, the situation is reversed. This devitation from co-rotation disappears at lower latitudes. The magnetic effect on the ground within the polar regions corresponds to an ionospheric Hall current at about 10&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; polar distance encircling the magnetic poles in a clockwise direction as seen by an observer standing on the ground during interplanetatry sectors with fields pointing away from the sun, and in a counterclockwise direction during toward-sector polarity &lt;ref name=VollandAE/&gt;

'''Dr Kim Sloan''' is a Canadian [[art historian]].

==Career==
Sloan worked for the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in 1986 where she curated an exhibition on [[Alexander Cozens]] from November 1986-January 1987. The exhibition then traveled to the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]] with additional works by his son [[John Robert Cozens]] and was on display January–March 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/alexanderjohnrob00sloa|title=Alexander and John Robert Cozens : the poetry of landscape|last=Sloan|first=Kim|last2=Art Gallery of Ontario|last3=Victoria and Albert Museum|date=1986|publisher=New Haven : Published in association with the Art Gallery of Ontario by Yale University Press|others=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Sloan became the curator of British Drawings and Watercolours before 1880 at the [[British Museum]]. While at the [[British Museum]], Sloan has worked primarily on [[William Hamilton (diplomat)|Sir William Hamilton]] and his collections at the [[British Museum]], the watercolours of [[J. M. W. Turner]], and the [[Hans Sloane]] collections. From 2000, Sloan was the lead curator creating the new Enlightenment Gallery at the [[British Museum]], which presents the history of the collection in the [[King's Library]] after the library collection moved to the [[British Library]]. The new gallery opened in 2003 and Sloan maintains curatorial responsibility for the Enlightenment Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=COOTE|first=JEREMY|date=2007|title=Review of Enlightenment: Discovering the World in the Eighteenth Century|jstor=40793847|journal=Journal of Museum Ethnography|issue=19|pages=135–141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wissenschaftliche-sammlungen.de/de/termine/kim-sloan-turning-kings-library-enlightenment-gallery-thirteen-years|title=Kim Sloan: "Turning the King's Library into the Enlightenment Gallery - thirteen years on" · Koordinierungsstelle wissenschaftliche Sammlungen|website=wissenschaftliche-sammlungen.de|language=en|access-date=2018-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Linkwitz vs Butterworth.svg|thumb|Comparison of the magnitude response of the summed Butterworth and Linkwitz–Riley crossover filters. The Butterworth crossovers have a +3dB peak at the crossover frequency, whereas the L-R filters have a flat summed output.|300px|right]]

A '''Linkwitz–Riley''' ('''L-R''') '''filter''' is an [[infinite impulse response]] filter used in Linkwitz–Riley [[audio crossover]]s, named after its inventors [[Siegfried Linkwitz]] and [[Russ Riley]], which was originally described in ''Active Crossover Networks for Noncoincident Drivers'' in [http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=2649 JAES Volume 24 Issue 1 pp. 2-8; February 1976]. It is also known as a ''Butterworth squared'' filter. A Linkwitz-Riley "L-R" crossover consists of a parallel combination of a low-pass and a high-pass L-R filter. The filters are usually designed by cascading two [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth]] filters, each of which has &amp;minus;3 [[Decibel#Acoustics|dB]] gain at the cut-off frequency. The resulting Linkwitz–Riley filter has a &amp;minus;6&amp;nbsp;dB gain at the cutoff frequency. This means that summing the low-pass and high-pass outputs, the gain at the crossover frequency will be 0&amp;nbsp;dB, so the crossover behaves like an [[Allpass filter|all-pass]] filter, having a flat [[amplitude]] response with a smoothly changing [[phase response]]. This is the biggest advantage of L-R crossovers compared to [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth]] crossovers, whose summed output has a +3&amp;nbsp;dB peak around the crossover frequency. Since cascading two n&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth]] filters will give a 2nd order Linkwitz–Riley filter, theoretically any 2nd order Linkwitz–Riley crossover can be designed. However, crossovers of higher order than 4th may have less usability due to their complexity and increasing peak in [[group delay]] around crossover frequency.

==Common types==

===Second order Linkwitz–Riley crossover (LR2, LR-2)===

Second-order Linkwitz–Riley crossovers (LR2) have a 12&amp;nbsp;dB/octave (40&amp;nbsp;dB/decade) slope.  They can be realized by cascading two one-pole filters, or using a [[Sallen Key filter]] topology with a Q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; value of 0.5. There is a 180° phase difference between the [[lowpass]] and [[highpass]] output of the filter, which can be corrected by inverting one signal. In [[loudspeaker]]s this is usually done by reversing the polarity of one driver if the crossover is [[Passive component|passive]]. For [[Active component|active]] crossovers inversion is usually done using a unity gain inverting [[op-amp]].

===Fourth order Linkwitz–Riley crossover (LR4, LR-4)===

Fourth-order Linkwitz–Riley crossovers (LR4) are probably today's most commonly used type of audio crossover. They are constructed by cascading two 2nd-order [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth]] filters. Their slope is 24&amp;nbsp;dB/octave (80&amp;nbsp;dB/decade).  The phase difference amounts to 360°, i.e. the two drives appear in phase, albeit with a full period time delay for the low-pass section.

===Eighth order Linkwitz–Riley crossover (LR8, LR-8)===

Eighth-order Linkwitz–Riley crossovers (LR8) have a very steep, 48&amp;nbsp;dB/octave (160&amp;nbsp;dB/decade) slope. They can be constructed by cascading two 4th-order [[Butterworth filter|Butterworth]] filters.

The '''Lotka–Volterra equations''', also known as the '''predator–prey equations''', are a pair of first-order [[nonlinear]] [[differential equation]]s, frequently used to describe the [[dynamical system|dynamics]] of [[Systems biology|biological systems]] in which two species interact, one as a [[predator]] and the other as prey. The populations change through time according to the pair of equations:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 \frac{dx}{dt} &amp;= \alpha x - \beta x y, \\
 \frac{dy}{dt} &amp;= \delta x y - \gamma y,
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
where
:{{mvar|x}} is the number of prey (for example, [[rabbit]]s);
:{{mvar|y}} is the number of some [[Predation|predator]] (for example, [[fox]]es);
:&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dy}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; represent the instantaneous growth rates of the two populations;
:{{mvar|t}} represents time;
:{{math|''α'', ''β'', ''γ'', ''δ''}} are positive real [[parameter]]s describing the interaction of the two [[species]].

The Lotka–Volterra system of equations is an example of a [[Kolmogorov]] model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freedman |first=H.

==History==
The Lotka–Volterra predator–prey [[mathematical model|model]] was initially proposed by [[Alfred J. Lotka]] in the theory of autocatalytic chemical reactions in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lotka|first=A.

D'Ancona studied the fish catches in the [[Adriatic Sea]] and had noticed that the percentage of predatory fish caught had increased during the years of [[World War I]] (1914–18). This puzzled him, as the fishing effort had been very much reduced during the war years. Volterra developed his model independently from Lotka and used it to explain d'Ancona's observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kingsland|first=S.|title=Modeling Nature: Episodes in the History of Population Ecology|location=|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1995|isbn=0-226-43728-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model was later extended to include density-dependent prey growth and a [[functional response]] of the form developed by [[C. S. Holling]]; a model that has become known as the Rosenzweig–McArthur model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenzweig|first=M.

E.|year=1973|title=Do hares eat lynx?|journal=American Naturalist|issue=|pages=727–730|doi=10.1086/282870|volume=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the moose and wolf populations in [[Isle Royale National Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=C.|last2=Devulder|first2=G.|last3=Vucetich|first3=J.A.|last4=Peterson|first4=R.|last5=Arditi|first5=R.|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2656.2005.00977.x|title=The wolves of Isle Royale display scale-invariant satiation and density dependent predation on moose|journal=J.

In the late 1980s, an alternative to the Lotka–Volterra predator–prey model (and its common-prey-dependent generalizations) emerged, the ratio dependent or [[Arditi–Ginzburg equations|Arditi–Ginzburg model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arditi|first=R.|last2=Ginzburg|first2=L.

The Lotka–Volterra equations have a long history of use in [[Economics|economic theory]]; their initial application is commonly credited to [[Richard M. Goodwin|Richard Goodwin]] in 1965&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gandolfo|first=G.|authorlink=Giancarlo Gandolfo|title=Giuseppe Palomba and the Lotka–Volterra equations|journal=Rendiconti Lincei|volume=19|issue=4|pages=347–357|year=2008|doi=10.1007/s12210-008-0023-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodwin|first=R.

==Physical meaning of the equations==
The Lotka–Volterra model makes a number of assumptions, not necessarily realizable in nature, about the environment and evolution of the predator and prey populations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tiem.utk.edu/~gross/bioed/bealsmodules/predator-prey.html|title=PREDATOR-PREY DYNAMICS|website=www.tiem.utk.edu|access-date=2018-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#The prey population finds ample food at all times.
#The food supply of the predator population depends entirely on the size of the prey population.
#The rate of change of population is proportional to its size.
#During the process, the environment does not change in favour of one species, and genetic adaptation is inconsequential.
#Predators have limitless appetite.

As differential equations are used, the solution is [[determinism|deterministic]] and [[Continuous function|continuous]]. This, in turn, implies that the generations of both the predator and prey are continually overlapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooke|first=D.|last2=Hiorns|first2=R. W.|display-authors=etal|title=The Mathematical Theory of the Dynamics of Biological Populations|volume=II|publisher=Academic Press|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{see also|Competitive Lotka–Volterra equations}}

===Prey===
When multiplied out, the prey equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = \alpha x - \beta x y.&lt;/math&gt;

The prey are assumed to have an unlimited food supply and to reproduce exponentially, unless subject to predation; this [[exponential growth]] is represented in the equation above by the term ''αx''. The rate of predation upon the prey is assumed to be proportional to the rate at which the predators and the prey meet, this is represented above by ''βxy''. If either {{mvar|x}} or {{mvar|y}} is zero, then there can be no predation.

With these two terms the equation above can be interpreted as follows: the rate of change of the prey's population is given by its own growth rate minus the rate at which it is preyed upon.

===Predators===
The predator equation becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dt} = \delta xy - \gamma y.&lt;/math&gt;

In this equation, ''δxy'' represents the growth of the predator population. (Note the similarity to the predation rate; however, a different constant is used, as the rate at which the predator population grows is not necessarily equal to the rate at which it consumes the prey). ''γy'' represents the loss rate of the predators due to either natural death or emigration, it leads to an exponential decay in the absence of prey.

Hence the equation expresses that the rate of change of the predator's population depends upon the rate at which it consumes prey, minus its intrinsic death rate.

==Solutions to the equations==
The equations have [[periodic function|periodic]] solutions and do not have a simple expression in terms of the usual [[trigonometric function]]s, although they are quite tractable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Antonio|last2=Gander|first2=Martin Jakob|year=1999|title=Parametrische Lösungen der Räuber-Beute-Gleichungen im Vergleich|journal=Il Volterriano|volume=7|issue=|pages=32–44|url=http://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:6300/ATTACHMENT01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Evans|first=C. M.|last2=Findley|first2=G. L.|title=A new transformation for the Lotka-Volterra problem|journal=Journal of Mathematical Chemistry|volume=25|issue=|pages=105–110|year=1999|doi=10.1023/A:1019172114300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If none of the non-negative parameters {{math|''α'', ''β'', ''γ'', ''δ''}} vanishes, three can be absorbed into the normalization of variables to leave only one parameter: since the first equation is homogeneous in {{math|''x''}}, and the second one in {{math|''y''}}, the parameters ''β''/''α'' and ''δ''/''γ'' are absorbable in the normalizations of {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''x''}} respectively, and {{math|''γ''}} into the normalization of {{math|''t''}}, so that only {{math|''α''/''γ''}} remains arbitrary. It is the only parameter affecting the nature of the solutions.

A [[linearization]] of the equations yields a solution similar to [[simple harmonic motion]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tong|first=H.|title=Threshold Models in Non-linear Time Series Analysis|location=|publisher=Springer–Verlag|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the population of predators trailing that of prey by 90° in the cycle.

===A simple example===
Suppose there are two species of animals, a baboon (prey) and a cheetah (predator). If the initial conditions are 80 baboons and 40 cheetahs, one can plot the progression of the two species over time. The choice of time interval is arbitrary.
[[File:Cheetah Baboon LV.jpg|center]]

One may also plot solutions parametrically as [[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]]s in [[phase space]], without representing time, but with one axis representing the number of prey and the other axis representing the number of predators for all times.

This corresponds to eliminating time from the two differential equations above to produce a single differential equation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = - \frac{y}{x} \frac{\delta x - \gamma}{\beta y -\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;
relating the variables ''x'' and ''y''. The solutions of this equation are closed curves. It is amenable to [[separation of variables]]: integrating
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\beta y - \alpha}{y} \,dy + \frac{\delta x - \gamma}{x} \,dx = 0&lt;/math&gt; 
yields the implicit relationship 
: &lt;math&gt;V = \delta x - \gamma \ln(x) + \beta y - \alpha \ln(y),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''V'' is a constant quantity depending on the initial conditions and conserved on each curve.

[[File:CentralTendencyLV.jpg|center|Phase-space plot]]

An aside: These graphs illustrate a serious potential problem with this ''as a biological model'': For this specific choice of parameters, in each cycle, the baboon population is reduced to extremely low numbers, yet recovers (while the cheetah population remains sizeable at the lowest baboon density). In real-life situations, however, chance fluctuations of the discrete numbers of individuals, as well as the family structure and life-cycle of baboons, might cause the baboons to actually go extinct, and, by consequence, the cheetahs as well. This modelling problem has been called the "atto-fox problem", an [[atto-]]&lt;nowiki&gt;fox&lt;/nowiki&gt; being a notional 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt; of a fox.&lt;ref name="LobrySari2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lobry |first1=Claude |last2=Sari |first2=Tewfik |title=Migrations in the Rosenzweig-MacArthur model and the "atto-fox" problem |journal=Arima |date=2015 |volume=20 |pages=95-125 |url=http://arima.inria.fr/020/pdf/vol.20.pp.95-125.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mollison |first=D. |url=http://www.ma.hw.ac.uk/~denis/epi/velocities.pdf |title=Dependence of epidemic and population velocities on basic parameters |journal=Math. Biosci. |volume=107 |pages=255–287 |year=1991 |doi=10.1016/0025-5564(91)90009-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Phase-space plot of a further example===
A less extreme example covers: 
{{mvar|α}} = 2/3, {{mvar|β}} = 4/3, {{mvar|γ}} = 1 = {{mvar|δ}}. Assume {{math|''x'', ''y''}} quantify thousands each. Circles represent prey and predator initial conditions from {{mvar|x}} = {{mvar|y}} = 0.9 to 1.8, in steps of 0.1. The fixed point is at (1, 1/2).
[[Image:Lotka-Volterra orbits 01.svg|center]]

==Dynamics of the system==
In the model system, the predators thrive when there are plentiful prey but, ultimately, outstrip their food supply and decline. As the predator population is low, the prey population will increase again. These dynamics continue in a cycle of growth and decline.

===Population equilibrium===
Population equilibrium occurs in the model when neither of the population levels is changing, i.e. when both of the derivatives are equal to 0:
:&lt;math&gt;x(\alpha - \beta y) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;-y(\gamma - \delta x) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

The above system of equations yields two solutions:

:&lt;math&gt;\{y = 0, x = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\left\{y = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}, x = \frac{\gamma}{\delta} \right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, there are two equilibria.

The first solution effectively represents the extinction of both species. If both populations are at 0, then they will continue to be so indefinitely. The second solution represents a fixed point at which both populations sustain their current, non-zero numbers, and, in the simplified model, do so indefinitely. The levels of population at which this equilibrium is achieved depend on the chosen values of the parameters ''α'', ''β'', ''γ'', and ''δ''.

===Stability of the fixed points===
The stability of the fixed point at the origin can be determined by performing a [[linearization]] using [[partial derivative]]s.

The [[Jacobian matrix]] of the predator–prey model is

:&lt;math&gt;J(x, y) = \begin{bmatrix} 
 \alpha - \beta y &amp; -\beta x \\
 \delta y &amp; \delta x - \gamma
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
and is known as [[community matrix]].

====First fixed point (extinction)====
When evaluated at the steady state of (0,&amp;nbsp;0), the Jacobian matrix ''J'' becomes

:&lt;math&gt;J(0, 0) = \begin{bmatrix}
 \alpha &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; -\gamma
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[eigenvalue]]s of this matrix are

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 = \alpha, \quad \lambda_2 = -\gamma.&lt;/math&gt;

In the model ''α'' and ''γ'' are always greater than zero, and as such the sign of the eigenvalues above will always differ. Hence the fixed point at the origin is a [[saddle point]].

The stability of this fixed point is of significance. If it were stable, non-zero populations might be attracted towards it, and as such the dynamics of the system might lead towards the extinction of both species for many cases of initial population levels. However, as the fixed point at the origin is a saddle point, and hence unstable, it follows that the extinction of both species is difficult in the model. (In fact, this could only occur if the prey were artificially completely eradicated, causing the predators to die of starvation. If the predators were eradicated, the prey population would grow without bound in this simple model.) The populations of prey and predator can get infinitesimally close to zero and still recover.

====Second fixed point (oscillations)====
Evaluating ''J'' at the second fixed point leads to
:&lt;math&gt;J\left(\frac{\gamma}{\delta}, \frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right) = \begin{bmatrix}
 0 &amp; -\frac{\beta \gamma}{\delta} \\
 \frac{\alpha \delta}{\beta} &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

The eigenvalues of this matrix are
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_1 = i \sqrt{\alpha \gamma}, \quad \lambda_2 = -i \sqrt{\alpha \gamma}.
&lt;/math&gt;

As the eigenvalues are both purely imaginary and conjugate to each others, this fixed point is [[Dynamical system#Conjugation results|elliptic]], so the solutions are periodic, oscillating on a small ellipse around the fixed point, with a period &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\lambda_1 \lambda_2} = \sqrt{\alpha \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;.

As illustrated in the circulating oscillations in the figure above, the level curves are closed [[orbit (dynamics)|orbit]]s surrounding the fixed point: the levels of the predator and prey populations cycle and oscillate without [[damping]] around the fixed point with period &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\alpha \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;.

The value of the [[constant of motion]] ''V'', or, equivalently, ''K'' = exp(''V''), &lt;math&gt;K = y^\alpha e^{-\beta y} x^\gamma e^{-\delta x}&lt;/math&gt;, can be found for the closed orbits near the fixed point.

Increasing ''K'' moves a closed orbit  closer to the fixed point. The largest value of the constant ''K'' is obtained by solving the optimization problem
:&lt;math&gt;y^\alpha e^{-\beta y} x^\gamma e^{-\delta x} = \frac{y^\alpha x^\gamma}{e^{\delta x+\beta y}} \longrightarrow \max\limits_{x,y&gt;0}.&lt;/math&gt;
The maximal value of ''K'' is thus attained at the stationary (fixed) point &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{\gamma}{\delta}, \frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and amounts to 
:&lt;math&gt;K^* = \left(\frac{\alpha}{\beta e}\right)^\alpha \left(\frac{\gamma}{\delta e}\right)^\gamma,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''e'' is [[e (mathematical constant)|Euler's number]].

To begin [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of [[zygotic]] [[genes]], the [[embryo]] must first overcome the [[Gene silencing|silencing]] that has been established. The cause of this [[Gene silencing|silencing]] could be due to several factors: [[chromatin]] [[Histone-Modifying Enzymes|modifications]] leading to repression, lack of adequate [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] [[RNA Polymerase|machinery]], or lack of time in which significant [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] can occur due to the shortened cell cycles.&lt;ref name="schier"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Schier AF |title=The Maternal-Zygotic Transition: Death and Birth of RNAs |journal=Science |volume=316 |pages=406–7 |year=2007 |pmid=17446392 |doi=10.1126/science.1140693 |issue=5823 | bibcode = 2007Sci...316..406S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence for the first method was provided by Newport and Kirschner's experiments showing that [[NC ratio|nucleocytoplasmic ratio]] plays a role in activating [[zygotic]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]].&lt;ref name="newport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newport2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Newport J, Kirschner M|lastauthoramp=yes |title=A major developmental transition in early ''Xenopus'' embryos: II. control of the onset of transcription. |journal=Cell |volume=30 |pages=687–96 |year=1982 |pmid= 7139712 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(82)90273-2|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; They suggest that a defined amount of repressor is packaged into the egg, and that the exponential amplification of [[DNA]] at each [[cell cycle]] results in titration of the repressor at the appropriate time. Indeed, in ''[[Xenopus]]'' [[embryos]] in which excess [[DNA]] is introduced, [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] begins earlier.&lt;ref name="newport"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newport2"/&gt; More recently, evidence has been shown that [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] of a subset of genes in [[Drosophila melanogaster|''Drosophila'']] is delayed by one [[cell cycle]] in [[haploid]] [[embryos]].&lt;ref name="lu"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lu X, Li JM, Elemento O, Tavazoie S, Wieschaus EF |title=Coupling of zygotic transcription to mitotic control at the ''Drosophila'' mid-blastula transition. |journal=Development |volume=136 |pages=2101–2110 |year=2009 |pmid= 19465600 |doi=10.1242/dev.034421 |issue=12 |pmc=2685728}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second mechanism of repression has also been addressed experimentally. Prioleau et al. show that by introducing [[TATA binding protein]] (TBP) into ''[[Xenopus]]'' oocytes, the block in transcription can be partially overcome.&lt;ref name="prioleau"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Prioleau MN, Huet J, Sentenac A, Mechali M |title=Competition between chromatin and transcription complex assembly regulates gene expression during early development. |journal=Cell |volume=77 |pages=439–49 |year=1994 |pmid=8181062  |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(94)90158-9 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hypothesis that shortened [[cell cycle]]s can cause repression of [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] is supported by the observation that [[mitosis]] causes transcription to cease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shermoen AW, O'Farrell PH|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Progression of the cell cycle through mitosis leads to abortion of nascent transcripts. |journal=Cell |volume=67 |pages=303–10 |year=1991 |pmid=1680567 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(91)90182-X |issue=2 |pmc=2755073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clearing of maternal transcripts==

To eliminate the contribution of maternal [[gene]] products to development, maternally-supplied [[Messenger RNA|mRNAs]] must be degraded in the [[embryo]]. Studies in [[Drosophila melanogaster|''Drosophila'']] have shown that sequences in the [[3' UTR]] of maternal transcripts mediate their degradation (reviewed by Tadros and Lipshitz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tadros W, Lipshitz HD|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Setting the stage for development: mRNA translation and stability during ooccyte maturation and egg activation in ''Drosophila'' |journal=Dev Dyn |volume=232 |pages=593–608 |year=2005 |pmid=15704150 |doi=10.1002/dvdy.20297 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;) These sequences are recognized by regulatory [[proteins]] that cause destabilization or degradation of the transcripts. Recent studies in both [[zebrafish]] and ''[[Xenopus]]'' have found evidence of a role for [[microRNAs]] in degradation of maternal transcripts. In [[zebrafish]], the [[microRNA]] miR-430 is expressed at the onset of [[zygotic]] [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and targets several hundred [[mRNA]]s for [[deadenylation]] and degradation. Many of these targets are [[genes]] that are expressed maternally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Giraldez AJ, Mishima Y, Rihel J, Grocock RJ, Van Dongen S, Inoue K, Enright AJ, Schier AF |title=Zebrafish miR-430 promotes deadenylation and clearance of maternal mRNAs. |journal=Science |volume=312 |pages=75–9 |issue=5770 |year=2006 |pmid=16484454 |doi=10.1126/science.1122689|bibcode = 2006Sci...312...75G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in ''[[Xenopus]]'', the miR-430 [[ortholog]] miR-427 has been shown to target maternal [[mRNA]]s for [[deadenylation]]. Specifically, miR-427 targets include [[cell cycle]] regulators such as [[Cyclin A1]] and [[Cyclin B2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lund E, Liu M, Hartley RS, Sheets MD, Dahlberg JE |title=Deadenylation of maternal mRNAs mediated by miR-427 in ''Xenopus laevis'' embryos. |journal=RNA |volume= 15|pages=2351–63 |pmid=19854872 |year=2009 |doi=10.1261/rna.1882009 |pmc=2779678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Nuclear Laboratory''' (informally '''NNL''', formerly '''Nexia Solutions''') is a [[UK government]] owned and operated nuclear services technology provider covering the whole of the nuclear fuel cycle. It is fully customer-funded and operates at six locations in the United Kingdom. Its customers have included the [[Nuclear Decommissioning Authority]], [[Sellafield Ltd]], [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]], the [[Health and Safety Executive]], the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority|UK Atomic Energy Authority]], [[VT Group|VT Nuclear]] and [[British Energy]]. It also has extensive links with academia, including collaborative agreements on waste immobilisation and disposal with the [[University of Sheffield]] and on nuclear materials research with the [[University of Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Consortium_selected_for_UK_National_Nuclear_Laboratory-2403097.html "Consortium selected for UK National Nuclear Laboratory"], ''World Nuclear News'' (24/03/09).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The organisation began to come together in 1996 when a number of separate research and development facilities began to coalesce into a single unit within [[BNFL|British Nuclear Fuels]]. In 2003, this Research and Technology business was re-launched as Nuclear Sciences and Technology Services (NSTS) to ready the business for transformation into a fully commercial entity. In 2005, following the restructuring of the wider nuclear industry, Nexia Solutions was formed out of NSTS, as a wholly owned subsidiary of [[BNFL]].

In July 2006, the [[UK Government]] stated its intention to preserve and develop key R&amp;D capabilities potentially as part of a National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL). In October 2006, [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]], [[Alistair Darling]] announced the establishment of the NNL, to be based on Nexia Solutions and the British Technology Centre at [[Sellafield]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nda.gov.uk/stakeholders/newsletter/nnl-announced-sos.cfm Alistair Darling announces the formation of the National Nuclear Laboratory], ''www.nda.gov.uk'' (30/06/06).&lt;/ref&gt; The NNL was formally announced by [[John Hutton (Labour MP)|John Hutton]], [[Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform]] in an announcement at the Sellafield Visitors Centre on 23 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_UK_national_laboratory_confirmed_2307082.html "UK national laboratory confirmed"], ''World Nuclear News'' (23 July 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 March 2009 it was announced by the [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]] (DECC) that a consortium made up of [[Serco]], [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]] and the [[University of Manchester]] had been selected as the new management contractors for the NNL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publictechnology.net/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=19457 "Consortium appointed to run UK's National Nuclear Lab to be run"], ''www.publictechnology.net ''(23/03/09).&lt;/ref&gt; The contract was for an initial three-year period with options to be extended by up to two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advfn.com/news_Serco-Battelle-To-Run-UK-National-Nuclear-Laboratory_36987885.html "Serco, Battelle To Run UK National Nuclear Laboratory"], ''www.advfn.com'' (23 March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; DECC had been engaged in competitive dialogue with the winning consortium as well as QQEST, a joint venture between [[QinetiQ]] and [[EnergySolutions]], since October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/nuclear_lab/nuclear_lab.aspx "Press Release – Serco, Battelle and the University of Manchester to run National Nuclear Lab"], ''www.decc.gov.uk'' (23/03/09).&lt;/ref&gt;

The management contract commenced on 1 April 2009, when ownership of the NNL transferred from BNFL directly to DECC with shareholder responsibilities delegated to the [[Shareholder Executive]]. From day one of the new contract, the focus was on positioning the NNL as the employer of choice for nuclear scientists and engineers, and working in partnership with customers to deliver valuable [[solution]]s to the challenges faced by the national and international nuclear market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serco.com/media/pressreleases/2009/serco-battelle.asp "Serco – Battelle – University of Manchester consortium named as Recommended Bidder to run National Nuclear Laboratory"], ''www.serco.com'' (23/03/09).&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Lawrence of [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]] was appointed to lead the new NNL management team as managing director. He had more than 40 years of experience in the nuclear profession, including management of the United States Hanford Reservation and its massive site clean-up program, and his former role as the US representative on nuclear matters to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.battelle.org/spotlight/3-23-09ennl09.aspx "Battelle in consortium selected to lead England's National Nuclear Laboratory"], ''www.battelle.org'' (23/03/09).&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Lawrence retired in December 2010 and was replaced by Professor Paul Howarth, formerly NNL's Director of Science, Technology and Project Delivery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nnl.co.uk/news/appointment-of-a-new-managing-director-for-nnl.html Appointment of a New Managing Director for NNL]&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 October 2013 the management contract expired, and the NNL became operated directly by the [[UK Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nnl.co.uk/news-media-centre/national-nuclear-laboratory-takes-next-step-in-its-evolution.aspx |title=National Nuclear Laboratory Takes Next Step in its Evolution |publisher=NNL |year=2013 |accessdate=3 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002100459/http://www.nnl.co.uk/news-media-centre/national-nuclear-laboratory-takes-next-step-in-its-evolution.aspx |archivedate=2 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20835">[[File:Masanobu-Fukuoka.jpg|right|thumbnail|Masanobu Fukuoka, originator of the natural farming method]]

'''Natural farming''' is an [[ecological farming]] approach established by [[Masanobu Fukuoka]] (1913–2008), a Japanese [[farmer]] and philosopher, introduced in his 1975 book ''[[The One-Straw Revolution]]''. Fukuoka described his way of farming as {{Eigo|[[:ja:自然農法|自然農法]]|shizen nōhō}} in Japanese.&lt;ref name="One–Straw_Translator's_Notes"&gt;1975 {{ja icon}} {{nihongo2|自然農法-わら一本の革命}} {{en icon}} 1978 re-presentation ''The One-Straw Revolution: An Introduction to Natural Farming''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as "the Fukuoka Method", "the natural way of farming" or "do-nothing farming". The title refers not to lack of effort, but to the avoidance of manufactured inputs and equipment. Natural farming is related to fertility farming, [[organic farming]], [[sustainable agriculture]], [[agroecology]], [[agroforestry]], [[ecoagriculture]] and [[permaculture]], but should be distinguished from [[biodynamic agriculture]].

The system works along with the natural biodiversity of each farmed area, encouraging the complexity of living organisms—both plant and animal—that shape each particular ecosystem to thrive along with food plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/life-and-death/|title=Life and Death in the Field {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fukuoka saw farming both as a means of producing food and as an aesthetic or spiritual approach to life, the ultimate goal of which was, "the cultivation and perfection of human beings".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.futures.2009.08.001| title = Linking foresight and sustainability: An integral approach| journal = Futures| volume = 42| pages = 59| year = 2010| last1 = Floyd | first1 = J. | last2 = Zubevich | first2 = K. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Agriculture: A Fundamental Principle |last=Hanley |first=Paul |journal=Journal of Bahá’í Studies |volume=3 |issue=1 |year=1990 |url=https://www.bahai-studies.ca/journal/files/jbs/3.1%20Hanley.pdf |accessdate=April 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327202848/http://www.bahai-studies.ca/journal/files/jbs/3.1%20Hanley.pdf |archivedate=March 27, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that farmers could benefit from closely observing local conditions.&lt;ref name="Duncan1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Colin Adrien MacKinley Duncan|title=The Centrality of Agriculture: Between Humankind and the Rest of Nature|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=c0ZcTTXw9a8C}}|year=1996|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-6571-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Natural farming is a closed system, one that demands no human-supplied inputs and mimics nature.&lt;ref&gt;Trees on Organic Farms, Mirret, Erin Paige. North Carolina State University, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Fukuoka's ideas radically challenged conventions that are core to modern agro-industries; instead of promoting importation of nutrients and chemicals, he suggested an approach that takes advantage of the local environment.&lt;ref name="stock and morse"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Morse|author2=Michael Stockin|title=People and Environment: Development for the Future|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=nPeHlOh0y_UC}}|year=1995|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|isbn=978-1-85728-283-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although natural farming is considered a subset of organic farming, it differs greatly from conventional [[organic farming]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Participating in Nature: Thomas J. Elpel's Field Guide to Primitive Living Skills |last=Elpel |first=Thomas J. |date=November 1, 2002 |isbn=1892784122}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Fukuoka considered to be another modern technique that disturbs nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jef.or.jp/backnumber/162th_promenade.pdf  What Does Natural Farming Mean?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720070520/http://www.jef.or.jp/backnumber/162th_promenade.pdf |date=2011-07-20 }} by Toyoda, Natsuko&lt;/ref&gt;

Fukuoka claimed that his approach prevents [[water pollution]], [[biodiversity loss]] and [[soil erosion]], while providing ample amounts of food.&lt;ref name="Reddystudies2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Priya Reddy|author2=Prescott College Environmental studies|title=Sustainable Agricultural Education: An Experiential Approach to Shifting Consciousness and Practices|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=dtE8MwEACAAJ}}|year=2010|publisher=Prescott College|isbn=978-1-124-38302-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fukuoka's principles ==

In principal, practitioners of natural farming maintain that it is not a ''technique'' but a ''view'', or a way of seeing ourselves as a [[Nature connectedness|part of nature]], rather than separate from or above it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org/masanobu-fukuoka-and-natural-farming/|title=Masanobu Fukuoka and Natural Farming {{!}} Final Straw – Food {{!}} Earth {{!}} Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the methods themselves vary widely depending on culture and local conditions.

Rather than offering a structured method, Fukuoka distilled the natural farming mindset into five principles:&lt;ref name="Norberg-HodgeGoering2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Helena Norberg-Hodge|author2=Peter Goering|author3=John Page|title=From the Ground Up: Rethinking Industrial Agriculture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I4sQTjNulnQC|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-85649-994-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# No [[tillage]]
# No [[fertilizer]]
# No [[pesticide]]s or [[herbicide]]s

Though many of his plant varieties and practices relate specifically to Japan and even to local conditions in [[Humid subtropical climate|subtropical]] western [[Shikoku]], his philosophy and the governing principles of his farming systems have been applied widely around the world, from Africa to the [[temperate]] northern hemisphere.

Principally, natural farming minimises human labour and adopts, as closely as practical, nature's production of foods such as [[rice]], [[barley]], [[daikon]] or [[citrus]] in biodiverse agricultural [[ecosystem]]s. Without [[plow]]ing, [[seeds]] [[germination|germinate]] well on the surface if site conditions meet the needs of the seeds placed there. Fukuoka used the presence of [[spiders]] in his fields as a [[key performance indicator]] of [[sustainability]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Fukuoka specifies that the ground remain covered by [[weed]]s, [[white clover]], [[alfalfa]], [[herbaceous]] [[legume]]s, and sometimes deliberately sown [[herbaceous plant]]s. [[Ground cover]] is present along with grain, vegetable crops and [[orchards]]. Chickens run free in orchards and [[ducks]] and [[carp]] populate rice fields.&lt;ref&gt;1975 {{ja icon}} {{nihongo2|自然農法-わら一本の革命}} {{en icon}} 1978 re-presentation ''The One-Straw Revolution: An Introduction to Natural Farming''&lt;/ref&gt;

Periodically ground layer plants including weeds may be cut and left on the surface, returning their nutrients to the soil, while suppressing weed growth. This also facilitates the sowing of seeds in the same area because the dense ground layer hides the seeds from animals such as birds.

For summer rice and winter barley grain crops, ground cover enhances [[nitrogen fixation]]. [[Straw]] from the previous crop [[mulch]]es the [[topsoil]]. Each grain crop is sown before the previous one is harvested by [[broadcast seeding|broadcasting]] the seed among the standing crop. Later, this method was reduced to a single direct seeding of clover, barley and rice over the standing heads of rice.&lt;ref name="Fukuoka1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=Masanobu Fukuoka|title=The Natural Way of Farming: The Theory and Practice of Green Philosophy|url={{google books|plainurl=y |id=L3M_AAAAYAAJ}}|year=1987|publisher=Japan Publications|isbn=978-0-87040-613-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a denser crop of smaller, but highly productive and stronger plants.

Fukuoka's practice and philosophy emphasised small scale operation and challenged the need for mechanised farming techniques for high productivity, efficiency and economies of scale.  While his family's farm was larger than the Japanese average, he used one field of grain crops as a small-scale example of his system.

== Yoshikazu Kawaguchi ==
[[File:Natural farmer Yoshikazu Kawaguchi.jpg|thumb|Yoshikazu Kawaguchi at Akame Natural Farm School]]
Widely regarded as the leading practitioner of the second-generation of natural farmers, [[Yoshikazu Kawaguchi]] is the instigator of Akame Natural Farm School, and a related network of volunteer-based "no-tuition" natural farming schools in Japan that numbers 40 locations and more than 900 concurrent students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=(Japan))|first=Hokazono, S.(Mie Univ., Tsu|last2=K.|first2=Ohara,|date=2007-01-01|title=The role of a learning site for urban residents hoping to do farming: Focusing on the spread of 'natural farming' by the Akame Natural Farming School|url=http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=JP2008004433|journal=Journal of Rural Problems (Japan)|language=Japanese|issn=0388-8525}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kawaguchi's practice is based on Fukuoka's principals, his methods differ notably from those of Fukuoka. He re-states the core values of natural farming as:

# Do not plow the fields
# Weeds and insects are not your enemies
# There is no need to add fertilizers
# Adjust the foods you grow based on your local climate and conditions

Kawaguchi's recognition outside of Japan has become wider after his appearance as the central character in the documentary ''[[Final Straw: Food, Earth, Happiness]]'', through which his interviews were translated into several languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finalstraw.org|title=Final Straw – Food - Earth - Happiness|website=www.finalstraw.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the author of several books in Japan, though none have been officially translated into English.

Since 2016, Kawaguchi is no longer directly instructing at the Akame school which he founded. He is still actively teaching however, holding open farm days at his own natural farm in Nara prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/37510039_Body_and_Earth_Are_Not_Two_Kawaguchi_Yoshikazu's_NATURAL_FARMING_and_American_Agriculture_Writers |title='Body and Earth Are Not Two': Kawaguchi Yoshikazu's NATURAL FARMING and American Agriculture Writers|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Climax ecosystems ==

In [[ecology]], [[climax ecosystem]]s are mature ecosystems that have reached a high degree of stability, productivity and diversity (see [[old-growth forest]]). Natural farmers attempt to mimic those virtues, creating a comparable climax ecosystem, and employ advanced techniques such as [[intercropping]], [[companion planting]] and [[integrated pest management]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

=== No-till ===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}

Natural farming recognizes soils as a fundamental natural asset. Ancient soils possess physical and chemical attributes that render them capable of generating and supporting life abundance. It can be argued that tilling actually degrades the delicate balance of a climax soil:

# Tilling may destroy crucial physical characteristics of a soil such as ''[[water potential|water suction]]'', its ability to send moisture upwards, even during dry spells. The effect is due to pressure differences between soil areas. Furthermore, tilling most certainly destroys [[soil horizon]]s and hence disrupts the established flow of nutrients. A study suggests that reduced tillage preserves the crop residues on the top of the soil, allowing organic matter to be formed more easily and hence increasing the total organic carbon and nitrogen when compared to conventional tillage. The increases in organic carbon and nitrogen increase aerobic, facultative anaerobic and [[anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[bacteria]] populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Principles and Applications of Soil Microbiology| last1=Sylvia |first1=D.M. |last2=Fuhrmann |first2=J.J. |last3=Hartel |first3=P.G. |last4=Zuberer |first4=D.A.| publisher=Prentice Hall| location=New Jersey| year=1999| ISBN=0130941174| pages=39–41 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=tLjwAAAAMAAJ|p=39}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Tilling over-pumps oxygen to local soil residents, such as [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]]. As a result, the chemistry of the soil changes. Biological decomposition accelerates and the [[microbiota (microbiology)|microbiota]] mass increases at the expense of other organic matter, adversely affecting most plants, including trees and vegetables. For plants to thrive a certain quantity of organic matter (around 5%) must be present in the soil.
# Tilling uproots all the plants in the area, turning their roots into food for bacteria and fungi. This damages their ability to aerate the soil. Living roots drill millions of tiny holes in the soil and thus provide oxygen.&lt;!-- just oxygen? --&gt; They also create room for beneficial [[insect]]s and [[annelid]]s (the phylum of [[worm]]s). Some types of roots contribute directly to soil fertility by funding a [[mutualism (biology)|mutualistic relationship]] with certain kinds of bacteria (most famously the [[rhizobium]]) that can fix nitrogen.

Fukuoka advocated avoiding any change in the [[natural landscape]]. This idea differs significantly from some recent permaculture practice that focuses on permaculture design, which may involve the change in landscape. For example, [[Sepp Holzer]], an Austrian permaculture farmer, advocates the creation of terraces on slopes to control soil erosion. Fukuoka avoided the creation of terraces in his farm, even though terraces were common in China and Japan in his time. Instead, he prevented soil erosion by simply growing trees and shrubs on slopes.

== Variants of natural farming ==
[[File:P-14 lady beetle.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ladybird]]s consume [[aphid]]s and are considered beneficial by natural farmers that apply [[biological control]].]]Although the term "natural farming" came into common use in the English language during the 1980s with the translation of the book ''One Straw Revolution'', the natural farming mindset itself has a long history throughout the world, spanning from historical Native American practices to modern day urban farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thenatureofcities.com/2015/09/16/a-restaurant-and-garden-serving-up-connections-to-urban-nature/|title=Social Practice Artwork: A Restaurant and Garden Serving up Connections to Urban Nature|last=Lydon|first=Patrick|date=2015-09-16|website=The Nature of Cities|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sociecity.org/post/2015/urban-empathy-garden/|title=Artwork / Urban Empathy Garden {{!}} SocieCity|website=sociecity.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|jstor=10.1525/j.ctt1ppfn4|title=Tending the Wild: Native American Knowledge and the Management of California's Natural Resources|last=ANDERSON|first=M.

Some variants, and their particularities include:

=== Fertility farming ===

In 1951, [[Frank Newman Turner|Newman Turner]] advocated the practice of "fertility farming", a system featuring the use of a cover crop, no tillage, no chemical fertilizers, no pesticides, no weeding and no composting. Although Turner was a commercial farmer and did not practice random seeding of [[seed balls]], his "fertility farming" principles share similarities with Fukuoka's system of natural farming. Turner also advocate a "natural method" of [[animal husbandry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Newman Turner| title=Fertility Farming| ISBN=978-1601730091| year=1951| publisher=Faber and Faber Limited| url=http://www.journeytoforever.org/farm_library/turner/turnerToC.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Native American ===
Recent research in the field of [[traditional ecological knowledge]] finds that for over one hundred centuries, Native American tribes worked the land in strikingly similar ways to today's natural farmers. Author and researcher M. Kat Anderson writes that "According to contemporary Native Americans, it is only through interaction and relationships with native plants that mutual respect is established."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Nature Farming (Mokichi Okada) ===
Japanese farmer and philosopher [[Mokichi Okada]], conceived of a "no fertilizer" farming system in the 1930s that predated Fukuoka. Okada used the same [[Chinese characters]] as Fukuoka's "natural farming" however, they are translated into English slightly differently, as [[nature farming]].&lt;ref name="NATURE FARMING-Xu1"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ressign.com/UserBookDetail.aspx?bkid=460&amp;catid=140|title=NATURE FARMING In Japan|last=Xu|first=Hui-Lian|publisher=Research Signpost|year=2001 |location=T. C. 37/661(2), Fort Post Office, Trivandrum - 695023, Kerala, India |type=Monograph|isbn=81-308-0111-6 |accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture researcher Hu-lian Xu claims that "nature farming" is the correct literal translation of the Japanese term.&lt;ref name="NATURE FARMING-Xu1" /&gt;

=== Rishi Kheti ===
In [[India]], natural farming is often referred to as "Rishi Kheti", a practice which includes ancient [[Vedic]] principles of farming including use of animal waste and herbs for controlling pests and promoting growth.&lt;ref name="Mr. Fukuoka news article 2010 Mumbai India"&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/lifestyle/report_masanobu-fukuoka-the-man-who-did-nothing_1426864 "Masanobu Fukuoka: The man who did nothing By Malvika Tegta"] "DNA Daily News and Analysis". "Published: Sunday, Aug 22, 2010, 2:59 IST". "Place: Mumbai", India. (Retrieved 1 December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature Farmers-India Rishi Keti"&gt;[http://www.satavic.org/rishikheti.htm "Natural farming succeeds in Indian village By Partap C Aggarwal" in the 1980s] [http://www.satavic.org/media.htm ''Satavic Farms''] (India), "Slowly, bit by bit, we found ourselves close to what is called ‘natural farming’, pioneered in Japan by Masanobu Fukuoka. At Rasulia we called it 'rishi kheti' (agriculture of the sages)."&lt;/ref&gt; The rishi or Indian sages use cow products like buttermilk, milk, curd and its waste urine for preparing growth promoters. The Rishi or Vedic farming is regarded as non-violent farming without any usage of chemical fertilizer and pesticides. They obtain high quality natural or organic produce having medicinal values. Today still a small number of farmers in Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu use this farming method in India.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Zero Budget Farming===
Zero Budget Farming is a variation on natural farming developed in, and primarily practiced in southern India.It also called spiritual farming .The method involves [[mulching]], [[intercropping]], and the use of several preparations which include [[cow dung]]. These preparations, generated on-site, are central to the practice, and said to promote microbe and earthworm activity in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Budget Natural Farming in India|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-bl990e.pdf|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|accessdate=25 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian agriculturist [[Subhash Palekar]] has researched and written extensively on this method.

{{Books of the New Testament}}
{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}

The '''New Testament''' ({{lang-gr|Ἡ Καινὴ Διαθήκη}}, [[Transliteration|trans.]] ''Hē Kainḕ Diathḗkē''; {{lang-la|Novum Testamentum}}) is the second part of the [[Christian biblical canons|Christian biblical canon]], the first part being the [[Old Testament]], based on the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]], as well as events in [[Christianity in the 1st century|first-century Christianity]]. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as [[Religious text|sacred scripture]]. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the [[Early centers of Christianity|spread of Christianity around the world]]. It reflects and serves as a source for [[Christian theology]] and [[Christian ethics|morality]]. Extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various [[Christian liturgy|Christian liturgies]]. The New Testament has influenced religious, [[Philosophical movement|philosophical]], and [[Political movement|political]] [[Social movement|movements]] in [[Christendom]] and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music.

The New Testament is a collection of Christian works written in the [[Koine Greek|common (Koine) Greek]] language of the first century, at different times by various writers, and the modern consensus is that it provides important evidence regarding [[Christianity and Judaism|Judaism]] in the first century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Barton (theologian)|Barton, John]] (3 February 2012). "Before the parting of the ways". ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]''. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In almost all Christian traditions today, the New Testament consists of 27 books. 
The [[Biblical canon|canon]] or list of the books of the New Testament is not found anywhere in any book of the Bible. It was the united Catholic Church which defined the 27-book canon. The first time we find the complete list of the 27 books of the NT is in Athanasius, eastern Catholic bishop of the IV Century. The first time that church councils gave us this same list was in the councils of Hippo (393) and Carthage (397) in north Africa and the pope Innocent I ratified the same canon in 405, but it is probable that a Council in Rome in 382 under pope Damasus gave the same list first. These councils also provided the canon of the Old Testament, which included the so-called apocryphal books &lt;ref&gt; Introduction to the New Testament. Werner Georg Kummel, pages 500f. Abingdon Press. Nashville. 1993. &lt;/ref&gt;.

The original texts were written in the first century of the [[Christian Era]], in Greek, which was the [[Lingua franca|common language]] of the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] from the [[Wars of Alexander the Great|conquests of Alexander the Great]] (335–323 BC) until the [[Muslim conquests]] in the 7th century AD. All the works that eventually became incorporated into the New Testament are believed to have been written no later than around 120 AD.&lt;ref name = seeStandard&gt;See the books listed under "Further reading", below, by Goodspeed, Kümmel, Duling and Perrin, Koester, Conzelmann and Lindemann, Brown, and Ehrman. E.g. {{cite book |author=Bart D. Ehrman |title=The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xpoNAQAAMAAJ |year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-508481-8 |page=8 |quote=The New Testament contains twenty-seven books, written in Greek, by fifteen or sixteen different authors, who were addressing other Christian individuals or communities between the years 50 and 120 C.E.

Collections of related texts such as [[Pauline epistles|letters]] of the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]] (a major collection of which must have been made already by the early 2nd century)&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Clabeaux, J. J. (1989). ''A Lost Edition of the Letters of Paul: A Reassessment of the Text of the Pauline Corpus Attested by [[Marcion]]''. Catholic Biblical Quarterly Monograph Series, 21. Washington, D.C.: Catholic Biblical Association.{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Canonical Gospels]] of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John (asserted by [[Irenaeus|Irenaeus of Lyon]] in the late-2nd century as ''the'' Four Gospels) gradually were joined to other collections and single works in different combinations to [[Development of the Christian biblical canon|form various Christian canons of Scripture]]. Over time, some [[Antilegomena|disputed books]], such as the [[Book of Revelation]] and the [[Catholic epistles|Minor Catholic (General) Epistles]] were introduced into [[Biblical canon|canons]] in which they were originally absent. Other works earlier held to be Scripture, such as [[1 Clement]], the [[Shepherd of Hermas]], and the [[Diatessaron]], were excluded from the New Testament. The Old Testament canon is not completely uniform among all major Christian groups including [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], [[Protestantism|Protestants]], the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], the [[Slavic Orthodox|Slavic Orthodox Churches]], and the [[Armenian Orthodox Church]]. However, the [[Development of the New Testament canon|twenty-seven-book canon]] of the New Testament, at least since [[Late Antiquity]], has been almost universally recognized within [[Christianity]] (see [[Development of the New Testament canon]]).

The New Testament consists of:
*Four narratives of the life, teaching, death and resurrection of Jesus called "gospel" or the good news.
*A narrative of the [[Apostles|Apostle]] ministries in the [[Early Christianity|early church]], called the "Acts of the Apostles", and probably written by the same writer as the [[Gospel of Luke]], which it continues;
*Twenty-one letters, often called "[[epistles]]" from Greek "epistole", written by various authors, and consisting of Christian doctrine, counsel, instruction, and conflict resolution; and
*An [[Apocalypse]], the [[Book of Revelation]], which is a [[Prophecy|book of prophecy]], containing some instructions to [[Seven churches of Asia|seven local congregations of Asia Minor]], but mostly containing prophetical [[semiotics|symbology]], about the [[end time]]s.

The term "new testament" ([[Koine Greek]]: Ἡ Καινὴ Διαθήκη, ''Hē Kainḕ Diathḗkē''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/graeca/Chronologia/S_post01/NT/nte_intr.html|title=bibliotheca Augustana|author=|date=|work=hs-augsburg.de|accessdate=17 February 2016}}{{primary source inline|date=February 2016}}{{Original research inline|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2016}} or "[[new covenant]]" (Hebrew בְּרִית חֲדָשָׁה ''bərîṯ ḥăḏāšâ''){{citation needed|date=February 2016}} first occurs in {{Bibleref2|Jeremiah|31:31}} (Greek [[Septuagint]] καινὴ διαθήκη ''kainḕ diathḗkē'', cited in {{Bibleref2|Hebrews|8:8}}).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The same Greek phrase for "new covenant" is found elsewhere in the New Testament ({{Bibleref2|Luke|22:20}}, {{Bibleref2|1cor|11:25||1 Corinthians 11:25}}, {{Bibleref2|2cor|3:6||2 Corinthians 3:6}}, {{Bibleref2|Hebrews|8:8}}, and {{Bibleref2|Hebrews|9:15}}; cf. {{Bibleref2|2Cor|3:14||2 Corinthians 3:14}}).{{Original research inline|date=February 2016}}{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In early [[Bible translations into Latin]], the phrase was rendered ''foedus'', "federation", in {{Bibleref2|Jeremiah|31:31}},{{according to whom|date=February 2016}}{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and was rendered ''testamentum'' in {{Bibleref2|Hebrews|8:8}} and other instances from which comes the English term "New Testament."{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Modern English, like Latin, distinguishes [[wikt:testament|testament]] and [[wikt:covenant|covenant]] as alternative translations, and consequently the treatment of the term διαθήκη ''diathḗkē'' varies in [[Bible translations into English]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} [[John Wycliffe]]'s 1395 version is a translation of the [[Latin Vulgate]] and so follows different terms in Jeremiah and Hebrews:{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Lo! days shall come, saith the Lord, and I shall make a new covenant (from Latin ''foedus'') with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah.{{Bibleref2c|Jeremiah|31:31}}

:For he reproving him saith, Lo! days come, saith the Lord, when I shall establish a new testament (from Latin ''testamentum'') on the house of Israel, and on the house of Judah.{{Bibleref2c|Hebrews|8:8}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Use of the term ''New Testament'' to describe a collection of first and second-century Christian Greek Scriptures can be traced back to [[Tertullian]] (in ''Against [[Praxeas]]'' 15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Allen, Clifton J. | date = 1969 | title = The Broadman Bible Commentary: Volume 8, General Articles, Matthew-Mark | location = London, England, and Nashville, Tennessee, USA | publisher = Broadman Press | asin = B000BUN8GM | quote = Tertullian was apparently the first to use the term New Testament in the sense of a collection of books (Against Praxeas XV). }}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Against [[Marcion]]'', written ''circa'' 208 AD, he writes of
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the Divine Word, who is doubly edged with the two testaments of the [[Torah|law]] and the [[gospel]].&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. "Chapter XIV". [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian123.html ''Against Marcion, Book III''].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And Tertullian continues later in the book, writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
it is certain that the whole aim at which he [Marcion] has strenuously laboured, even in the drawing up of his [[Antitheses]], centres in this, that he may establish a diversity between the Old and the New Testaments, so that his own [[Christ]] may be separate from the [[Creator God|Creator]], as belonging to this rival god, and as alien from the law and the [[Neviim|prophets]].&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. "Chapter VI". [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian124.html ''Against Marcion, Book IV''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;See also Tertullian, [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian124.html ''Against Marcion, Book IV''], chapters I, II, XIV. However, his meaning in chapter XX is less clear, and in chapters IX and XL he uses the term to mean "new covenant".&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]], the existence—even if not the exact contents—of both an Old and New Testament had been established. [[Lactantius]], a 3rd–4th century Christian author wrote in his early-4th-century Latin ''Institutiones Divinae'' (''Divine Institutes''):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
But all scripture is divided into two Testaments. That which preceded the advent and passion of Christ—that is, the [[Torah|law]] and the [[Neviim|prophets]]—is called the Old; but those things which were written after His resurrection are named the New Testament. The Jews make use of the Old, we of the New: but yet they are not discordant, for the New is the fulfilling of the Old, and in both there is the same testator, even Christ, who, having suffered death for us, made us heirs of His everlasting kingdom, the people of the Jews being deprived and disinherited. As the prophet Jeremiah testifies when he speaks such things: "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new testament to the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; for they continued not in my testament, and I disregarded them, saith the Lord."{{Bibleref2c|Jer|31:31–32}}  ... For that which He said above, that He would make a new testament to the house of Judah, shows that the old testament which was given by Moses was not perfect; but that which was to be given by Christ would be complete.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius. "Chapter XX". [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf07.iii.ii.iv.xx.html "The Divine Institutes, Book IV"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
{{See also|Christian biblical canons|Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament apocrypha|Template:Books of the New Testament}}
The [[canon of the New Testament]] is the collection of books that most [[Christians]] regard as [[Biblical inspiration|divinely inspired]] and constituting the New Testament of the [[Christian biblical canons|Christian biblical canon]].&lt;ref name="mcdowell2006_canon"&gt;McDowell, Josh. Evidence for Christianity. Tennessee: Thomas Nelson, Inc. 2006. pp. 42–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period extending roughly from 50 to 150 AD, a number of documents began to circulate among the churches, including epistles, gospel accounts, memoirs, prophecies, homilies, and collections of teachings.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} While some of these documents were [[Apostolic Age|apostolic in origin]], others drew upon the tradition the apostles and ministers of the word had utilized in their individual missions, and still others represented a summation of the teaching entrusted to a particular church center.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Several of these writings sought to extend, interpret, and apply apostolic teaching to meet the needs of Christians in a given locality.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In general, among [[Christian denominations]] the New Testament canon came to be agreed-upon as a list of 27 books, although the order of the books can vary from one version of the printed scriptures to the next.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The book order is the same in the Greek Orthodox,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Roman Catholic,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and Protestant traditions.&lt;ref name="Luther"&gt;Bouman, Herbert J.

===The Gospels===
{{Main article|Canonical gospels}}
Each of the four [[gospels]] in the New Testament narrates the life, death, and resurrection of [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]]. The word "gospel" derives from the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''gōd-spell''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Gospel |title=Gospel |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (rarely ''godspel''), meaning "good news" or "glad tidings". The gospel was considered the "good news" of the coming [[Messiah#Christianity|Kingdom of Messiah]], and the redemption through the life and death of Jesus, the central Christian message.&lt;ref name="ODCC self Gospel"&gt;Cross, F. L., ed (2005). "Gospel". The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Gospel is a [[calque]] (word-for-word translation) of the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|εὐαγγέλιον}}, ''euangelion'' (''eu-'' "good", ''-angelion'' "message").

Since the 2nd century, the four narrative accounts of the life and work of Jesus Christ have been referred to as "The Gospel of ..." or "The Gospel according to ..." followed by the name of the supposed author. Whatever these admittedly early ascriptions may imply about the sources behind or the perception of these gospels, they are anonymous compositions.&lt;ref name = seeStandard/&gt;
* The [[Gospel of Matthew]], ascribed to the [[Matthew the Evangelist|Apostle Matthew]]. This gospel begins with a [[genealogy of Jesus]] and a story of his birth that includes a visit from [[Biblical Magi|magi]] and a [[flight into Egypt]], and it ends with the [[Great Commission|commissioning of the disciples]] by the resurrected Jesus.
* The [[Gospel of Mark]], ascribed to [[Mark the Evangelist]]. This gospel begins with the preaching of [[John the Baptist]] and the [[baptism of Jesus]]. Two different secondary endings were affixed to this gospel in the 2nd century.
* The [[Gospel of Luke]], ascribed to [[Luke the Evangelist]], who was not one of [[Twelve Disciples#The Twelve Apostles|the Twelve Apostles]], but was mentioned as a companion of the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]] and as a physician.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzmyer, Joseph A. (1985). ''The Gospel according to Luke, Vol. 1''. Anchor Bible Commentary series. New York: Doubleday. pp. 35–53.&lt;/ref&gt; This gospel begins with parallel stories of the birth and childhood of [[John the Baptist]] and [[Jesus]] and ends with appearances of the resurrected Jesus and his ascension into heaven.
* The [[Gospel of John]], ascribed to [[John the Apostle]]. This gospel begins with a philosophical prologue and ends with appearances of the resurrected Jesus. It is about Jesus's miracles.

The first three gospels listed above are classified as the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. They contain similar accounts of the events in Jesus' life and his teaching, due to their literary interdependence. The Gospel of John is structured differently and includes stories of several miracles of Jesus and sayings not found in the other three.

These four gospels that were eventually included in the New Testament were only a few among many other early Christian gospels. The existence of such texts is even mentioned at the beginning of the Gospel of Luke.{{Bibleref2c|Luke|1:1–4}} Other early Christian gospels such as the so-called "[[Jewish-Christian Gospels]]" or the [[Gospel of Thomas]], also offer both a window into the context of [[early Christianity]] and may provide some assistance in the reconstruction of the [[historical Jesus]].

===Acts of the Apostles===
The [[Acts of the Apostles]] is a narrative of the apostles' ministry and activity after [[Christ's death]] and resurrection, from which point it resumes and functions as a sequel to the [[Gospel of Luke]]. Examining style, phraseology, and other evidence, modern scholarship generally concludes that Acts and the Gospel of Luke share the same author, referred to as [[Luke–Acts]]. Luke-Acts does not name its author.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=196}} Church tradition identified him as [[Luke the Evangelist]], the companion of Paul, but the majority of scholars reject this due to the many contradictions between Acts and the authentic Pauline letters.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005|p=235}} The most probable date of composition is around 80–100 AD, and there is evidence that it was still being substantially revised well into the 2nd century.{{sfn|Perkins|2009|pp=250–53}}

===Epistles===
The epistles of the New Testament are considered by Christians to be divinely inspired and holy letters, written by the apostles and disciples of Christ, to either local congregations with specific needs, or to New Covenant Christians in general, scattered about; or "Catholic Epistles."

====Pauline Letters to Churches====
{{Main article|Pauline epistles}}
The Pauline epistles are the thirteen New Testament books that present [[Paul the Apostle]] as their author.{{refn|group=note|[[Joseph Barber Lightfoot]] in his ''Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians'' writes: "At this point [{{Bibleref2|Gal|6:11}}] the apostle takes the pen from his [[amanuensis]], and the concluding paragraph is written with his own hand. From the time when letters began to be forged in his name ({{bibleref2|2 Thess|2:2||2 Thess. 3:17}}; {{bibleref2-nb|2 Thess|3:17||2 Thess. 3:17}}) it seems to have been his practice to close with a few words in his own handwriting, as a precaution against such forgeries.... In the present case he writes a whole paragraph, summing up the main lessons of the epistle in terse, eager, disjointed sentences. He writes it, too, in large, bold characters (Gr. ''pelikois grammasin''), that his handwriting may reflect the energy and determination of his soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lightfoot |first=Joseph Barber |year=1866 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8ECAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA217 |title=St Paul's Epistle to the Galatians |edition=2nd |publisher=MacMillan &amp; Co |page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Six of the letters are disputed. Four are thought by most modern scholars to be [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphic]], i.e., not actually written by Paul even if attributed to him within the letters themselves.  Opinion is more divided on the other two disputed letters (2 Thessalonians and Colossians).&lt;ref&gt;Bassler, Jouette M. (2010). "Paul and his Letters". In Aune, David E. ''The Blackwell Companion to the New Testament''. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 388. {{ISBN|9781444318944}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These letters were written to Christian communities in specific cities or geographical regions, often to address issues faced by that particular community. Prominent themes include the relationship both to broader "[[Gentile|pagan]]" society, to Judaism, and to other Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Roetzel, Calvin J. (2009). ''The Letters of Paul: Conversations in Context'' (5th ed.). Louisville, Kentucky: Westminster John Knox. {{ISBN|9780664233921}}.{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Epistle to the Romans]]
*[[First Epistle to the Corinthians]]
*[[Second Epistle to the Corinthians]]
*[[Epistle to the Galatians]]
*[[Epistle to the Ephesians]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
*[[Epistle to the Philippians]]
*[[Epistle to the Colossians]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
*[[First Epistle to the Thessalonians]]
*[[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
[Disputed letters are marked with an asterisk (*).]

====Pauline Letters to Persons====
The last four Pauline letters in the New Testament are addressed to individual persons. They include the following:
* [[First Epistle to Timothy]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Second Epistle to Timothy]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Epistle to Titus]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Epistle to Philemon]]
[Disputed letters are marked with an asterisk (*).]

All of the above except for Philemon are known as the [[Pastoral epistles]]. They are addressed to individuals charged with pastoral oversight of churches and discuss issues of Christian living, doctrine and leadership. They often address different concerns to those of the preceding epistles. These letters are believed by many to be pseudepigraphic. Some scholars (e.g., Bill Mounce, Ben Witherington) will argue that the letters are genuinely Pauline, or at least written under Paul's supervision.

====Hebrews====
The [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] addresses a Jewish audience who had come to believe that Jesus was the [[Messiah#Judaism|anointed one]] (Hebrew: מָשִׁיחַ—transliterated in English as "Moshiach", or "Messiah"; Greek: Χριστός—transliterated in English as "Christos", for "[[Christ]]") who was predicted in the writings of the Hebrew Bible. The author discusses the "better-ness" of the new covenant and the ministry of Jesus, over the Mosaic covenant {{Bibleref2c|Heb.|1:1–10:18}} and urges the readers in the practical implications of this conviction through the end of the epistle.{{Bibleref2c|Heb.|10:19–13:25}}

The book has been widely accepted by the Christian church as inspired by God and thus authoritative, despite the acknowledgment of uncertainties about who its human author was. Regarding authorship, although the Epistle to the Hebrews does not internally claim to have been written by the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]], some similarities in wordings to some of the Pauline Epistles have been noted and inferred. In antiquity, some began to ascribe it to Paul in an attempt to provide the anonymous work an explicit apostolic pedigree.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold W. Attridge|Attridge, Harold W.]] (1989). ''Hebrews''. Hermeneia. Philadelphia: Fortress. pp. 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th century, [[Jerome]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] supported [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles|Paul's authorship]]. The Church largely agreed to include Hebrews as the fourteenth letter of Paul, and affirmed this authorship until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. The letter to the Hebrews had difficulty in being accepted as part of the Christian canon because of its anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Lane|Lane, William L.]] (1991). ''Hebrews 1–8''. Word Biblical Commentary series, Vol. 47A. Dallas, Texas: Word Books. p. cliv.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the 3rd century, [[Origen]] wrote of the letter, "Men of old have handed it down as Paul's, but who wrote the Epistle God only knows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm |author=Eusebius |title=Church History, Book VI |chapter=Chapter 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary scholars often reject Pauline authorship for the epistle to the Hebrews,&lt;ref name="Ehrman 2004:411"&gt;Ehrman, Bart D. (1997). ''The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings''. Oxford University Press. p. 323. "Scholars in the ancient world went about detecting forgeries in much the same way that modern scholars do. They looked to see whether the ideas and writing style of a piece conformed with those used by the author in other writings, and they examined the text for any blatant anachronisms, that is, statements about things that could not have existed at the time the alleged author was writing (like the letter reputedly from an early seventeenth-century American colonist that mentions "the United States")- Arguments of this kind were used by some Christian scholars of the third century to show that Hebrews was not written by Paul or the Book of Revelation by John the son of Zebedee. Modern scholars, as we will see, concur with these judgments. To be sure, neither of these books can be considered a forgery. Hebrews does not claim to be written by Paul (it is anonymous), and the John who wrote Revelation does not claim to be the son of Zebedee (it is therefore homonymous). Are there other books in the New Testament, though, that can be considered forgeries?"&lt;/ref&gt; based on its distinctive style and theology, which are considered to set it apart from Paul's writings.&lt;ref name=Powell&gt;{{cite book |last=Powell |first=Mark A. |year=2009 |title=Introducing the New Testament: A Historical, Literary, and Theological Survey |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|publisher=Baker Academic |pages=431–32 |isbn=9780801028687 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Catholic epistles====
The [[Catholic epistles]] (or "general epistles") consist of both letters and treatises in the form of letters written to the church at large. The term "[[catholic]]" ([[Koine Greek|Greek]]: καθολική, ''katholikē''), used to describe these letters in the oldest manuscripts containing them, here simply means "general" or "universal". The authorship of a number of these is disputed.
* [[Epistle of James]], written by an author named "James", often identified with [[James the Just|James, the brother of Jesus]].
* [[First Epistle of Peter]], ascribed to the [[Saint Peter|Apostle Peter]].
* [[Second Epistle of Peter]], ascribed to the Apostle Peter, though widely considered not to have been written by him.&lt;ref&gt;Fornberg, Tord (1977). ''An Early Church in a Pluralistic Society: A Study of 2 Peter''. Coniectanea Biblica, New Testament Series 9. Lund: Gleerup.{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[First Epistle of John]], ascribed to [[John the Apostle]].
* [[Second Epistle of John]], ascribed to John the Apostle.
* [[Third Epistle of John]], ascribed to John the Apostle.
* [[Epistle of Jude]], written under the name of [[Jude, brother of Jesus|Jude, the brother of Jesus and James]].

===Book of Revelation===
{{Further information|Authorship of the Johannine works}}
The final book of the New Testament is the [[Book of Revelation]], also known as the Apocalypse of John. In the New Testament canon, it is considered [[Bible prophecy|prophetical]] or [[apocalyptic literature]]. Its authorship has been attributed either to John the Apostle (in which case it is often thought that John the Apostle is [[John the Evangelist]], i.e. author of the [[Gospel of John]]) or to another John designated "[[John of Patmos]]" after the island where the text says the revelation was received (1:9). Some ascribe the writership date as circa 81–96 AD, and others at around 68 AD.&lt;ref name=Mounce&gt;[[Robert Mounce|Mounce, Robert]] (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?id=06VR1JzzLNsC&amp;pg=PA15 ''The Book of Revelation''] (revised ed.). The New International Commentary on the New Testament Series. Cambridge, UK: Eerdmans. pp. 15–16. {{ISBN|0802825370}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The work opens with letters to [[Seven churches of Asia|seven churches]] and thereafter takes the form of an [[apocalypse]], a literary genre popular in ancient Judaism and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed study of the Apocalypse of John, see Aune, David E. (1998). ''Revelation'', 3 volumes. Word Biblical Commentary series. Nashville, Tennessee: Thomas Nelson.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Table notes

&lt;references group=N /&gt;

==Book order==
The order in which the books of the New Testament appear differs between some collections and ecclesiastical traditions. In the Latin West, prior to the [[Vulgate]] (an early 5th-century Latin version of the Bible), the four Gospels were arranged in the following order: Matthew, John, Luke, and Mark.{{refn|group=note|The Gospels are in this order in many Old Latin manuscripts, as well as in the Greek manuscripts [[Codex Bezae]] and [[Codex Washingtonianus]].}} The Syriac [[Peshitta]] places the major Catholic epistles (James, 1 Peter, and 1 John) immediately after Acts and before the Pauline epistles.

The order of an early edition of the letters of Paul is based on the size of the letters: longest to shortest, though keeping 1 and 2 Corinthians and 1 and 2 Thessalonians together. The Pastoral epistles were apparently not part of the ''Corpus Paulinum'' in which this order originated and were later inserted after 2 Thessalonians and before Philemon. Hebrews was variously incorporated into the ''Corpus Paulinum'' either after 2 Thessalonians, after Philemon (i.e. at the very end), or after Romans.

The New Testament of the 16th-century [[Luther Bible]] continues, to this day, to place Hebrews, James, Jude, and the Apocalypse last. This reflects the thoughts of the Reformer Martin Luther [[Luther's canon|on the canonicity of these books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/links10.html|title=Web Directory: German Bible Versions|publisher=Bible Research|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|See also the article on the [[Antilegomena]].}}{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Apocrypha==
{{Main article|New Testament apocrypha}}
The books that eventually found a permanent place in the New Testament were not the only works of Christian literature produced in the earliest Christian centuries. The long process of [[Development of the New Testament canon|canonization]] began early, sometimes with tacit reception of traditional texts, sometimes with explicit selection or rejection of particular texts as either acceptable or unacceptable for use in a given context (e.g., not all texts that were acceptable for private use were considered appropriate for use in the [[liturgy]]).

Over the course of history, those works of early Christian literature that survived but that did not become part of the New Testament have been variously grouped by theologians and scholars. Drawing upon, though redefining, an older term used in [[early Christianity]] and among Protestants when referring to those books found in the Christian [[Old Testament]] although not in the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]], modern scholars began to refer to these works of early Christian literature not included in the New Testament as "apocryphal", by which was meant non-canonical.

Collected editions of these works were then referred to as the "[[New Testament apocrypha]]". Typically excluded from such published collections are the following groups of works: [[Apostolic Fathers|The Apostolic Fathers]], the 2nd-century Christian apologists, [[Alexandrian school|the Alexandrians]], [[Tertullian]], [[Methodius of Olympus]], [[Novatian]], [[Cyprian]], martyrdoms, and [[Desert Fathers|the Desert Fathers]]. Almost all other Christian literature from the period, and sometimes including works composed well into [[Late Antiquity]], are relegated to the so-called New Testament apocrypha.

Although not considered to be inspired by God,  these "apocryphal" works may be helpful in the study of the New Testament in that they were produced in the same ancient context and often using the same language as those books that would eventually form the New Testament. Some of these later works are dependent (either directly or indirectly) upon books that would later come to be in the New Testament or upon the ideas expressed in them. There is even an example of a [[pseudepigraph]]ical letter composed under the guise of a presumably lost letter of the Apostle Paul, the [[Epistle to the Laodiceans]].

==Authors==
{{Main article|Authorship of the Bible}}
The books of the New Testament were all or nearly all written by [[Jewish Christians]]—that is, Jewish disciples of Christ, who lived in the [[Roman Empire]], and under [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman occupation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Powell|2009|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luke, who wrote the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts, is frequently thought of as an exception; scholars are divided as to whether Luke was a Gentile or a [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic Jew]].&lt;ref name="Strelan2013"&gt;Strelan, Rick (2013). ''Luke the Priest: The Authority of the Author of the Third Gospel''. Farnham, ENG: Routledege-[[Ashgate Publishing|Ashgate]]. pp. 102–105.&lt;/ref&gt; A few scholars identify the author of the Gospel of Mark as probably a Gentile, and similarly for the Gospel of Matthew, though most assert Jewish-Christian authorship.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of Mark, see Schröter, Jens (2010). "Gospel of Mark". In Aune, David. ''The Blackwell Companion to the New Testament''. New York, USA: Wiley-Blackwell. pp. 281f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of Mark, see Hare, Douglas R. A.

===Gospels===
{{Main article|Synoptic Gospels}}
Authorship is an area of longstanding and current research and debate, with different works posing different problems for identification. While the various works have traditional ascriptions of authorship, these ascriptions are in some cases defended by scholars, and in other cases disputed or rejected.&lt;ref&gt;For overviews of the scholarship on authorship of the various New Testament works, see the relevant entries in Aune, David E., ed. (2010). ''The Blackwell Companion to the New Testament''. Hoboken, New Jersey, USA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; According to many (if not most) critical scholars, none of the authors of the Gospels were eyewitnesses or even explicitly claimed to be eyewitnesses.&lt;ref name=lost&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D.|authorlink=Bart D.

There is a tradition that the Apostle John was the author of the Gospel of John. Traditionalists (such as biblical commentators Albert Barnes and Matthew Henry) seem to support the idea that the writer of the Gospel of John himself claimed to be an eyewitness in their commentaries of John 21:24 and therefore the gospel was written by an eyewitness;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Barnes |first=Albert |title=Barnes' Notes on the New Testament |year=1962 |orig-year=1832 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qvXCoSQ1y0EC&amp;pg=PA360 |publisher=Kregel Publications |page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;{{Cite book|last=Henry |first=Matthew |title=Matthew Henry Complete Commentary on the Whole Bible |orig-year=1706 |url=http://www.studylight.org/commentaries/mhm/john-21.html |publisher=StudyLight.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this idea is rejected by the majority of modern scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Johannine Literature|last1=Lindars|first1=Barnabas|authorlink1 = Barnabas Lindars |last2=Edwards|first2=Ruth B.|last3=Court|first3=John M.|year=2000|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVOD0PhayhsC&amp;pg=PA41|ref=harv|pages=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of [[Richard Bauckham]]'s book ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony'' states "The common wisdom in the academy is that stories and sayings of Jesus circulated for decades, undergoing countless retellings and embellishments before being finally set down in writing."&lt;ref name="HahnScott2007"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first1=Scott W.|editor-last1=Hahn|editor-first2=David|editor-last2=Scott|title=Letter &amp; Spirit, Volume 3: The Hermeneutic of Continuity: Christ, Kingdom, and Creation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJ-fd4hQQJ0C&amp;pg=PA225|date=1 September 2007|publisher=Emmaus Road Publishing|isbn=978-1-931018-46-3|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars hold to the [[two-source hypothesis]], which claims that the [[Marcan priority|Gospel of Mark was written first]]. According to the hypothesis, the authors of the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke then used the Gospel of Mark and the hypothetical [[Q document]], in addition to some other sources, to write their individual gospel accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/mark.html |title=Gospel of Mark |publisher=Early Christian Writings |accessdate=15 January 2008 |last=Kirby |first=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Achtemeier |first=Paul J. |encyclopedia=The Anchor Bible Dictionary |title=The Gospel of Mark |year=1992 |publisher=Doubleday |volume=4 |location=New York |isbn=0-385-19362-9 |page=545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Easton, M.

Scholars agree that the Gospel of John was written last, by using a different tradition and body of testimony. In addition, most scholars agree that the author of Luke wrote the Acts of the Apostles. Scholars hold that these books constituted two halves of a single work, [[Luke-Acts]].

[[File:The Evangelist Matthew Inspired by an Angel.jpg|thumb|''Evangelist Mathäus und der Engel'', by [[Rembrandt]].]]
Strictly speaking, each gospel and the book of Acts is arguably anonymous.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris |first=Stephen L. |authorlink=Stephen L.

===Pauline epistles===
{{Main article|Authorship of the Pauline epistles}}
[[File:PaulT.jpg|thumb|''Saint Paul Writing His Epistles'', 17th-century painting. Most scholars think Paul actually dictated his letters to a secretary.]]
The Pauline epistles are the thirteen books in the New Testament traditionally attributed to [[Paul of Tarsus]]. The anonymous Epistle to the Hebrews is, despite unlikely Pauline authorship, often functionally grouped with these thirteen to form a corpus of fourteen "Pauline" epistles.{{refn|group=note|Although Hebrews was almost certainly not written by Paul, it has been a part of the Pauline corpus "from the beginning of extant MS production".&lt;ref name=hebot01&gt;{{cite web |last=Wallace |first=Daniel B. |url=https://bible.org/seriespage/19-hebrews-introduction-argument-and-outline |title=Hebrews: Introduction, Argument, and Outline |publisher=Bible.org |date=28 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Seven letters are generally classified as "undisputed", expressing contemporary scholarly near consensus that they are the work of Paul: Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians and Philemon. Six additional letters bearing Paul's name do not currently enjoy the same academic consensus: Ephesians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus.{{refn|group=note|name="Lock, Meinertz p.622"|Guthrie lists: ohlenberg, Lock, Meinertz, Thornell, Schlatter, Spicq, [[Jeremais|Jeremias]], Simpson, Kelly, and Fee"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Guthrie|1990|p=622}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While many scholars uphold the traditional view, some question whether the first three, called the "Deutero-Pauline Epistles", are authentic letters of Paul. As for the latter three, the "Pastoral epistles", some scholars uphold the traditional view of these as the genuine writings of the Apostle Paul;&lt;ref group="note" name="Lock, Meinertz p.622"/&gt; most, however, regard them as [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigrapha]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman (2004), p. 385.{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One might refer to the [[Epistle to the Laodiceans]] and the [[Third Epistle to the Corinthians]] as examples of works identified as pseudonymous. Since the early centuries of the church, there has been debate concerning the authorship of the anonymous Epistle to the Hebrews, and contemporary scholars generally reject Pauline authorship.&lt;ref name="Ehrman 2004:411"/&gt;

The epistles all share common themes, emphasis, vocabulary and style; they exhibit a uniformity of doctrine concerning the [[Ten Commandments|Mosaic Law]], Jesus, faith, and various other issues. All of these letters easily fit into the chronology of Paul's journeys depicted in Acts of the Apostles.

===Other epistles===
The author of the [[Epistle of James]] identifies himself in the opening verse as "James, a servant of [[God]] and of the Lord [[Jesus]] Christ". From the middle of the 3rd century, [[patristic]] authors cited the ''Epistle'' as written by [[James the Just]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/j/james,epistle_of_st.html "Epistle of St. James"]. ''1914 Catholic Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient and modern scholars have always been divided on the issue of authorship. Many consider the epistle to be written in the late 1st or early 2nd centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earlychristianwritings.com/james.html |title=Epistle of James |publisher=Early Christian Writings |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author of the [[First Epistle of Peter]] identifies himself in the opening verse as "Peter, an [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]] of Jesus Christ", and the view that the epistle was written by St. Peter is attested to by a number of [[Church Fathers]]: [[Irenaeus]] (140–203), [[Tertullian]] (150–222), [[Clement of Alexandria]] (155–215) and [[Origen of Alexandria]] (185–253). Unlike [[The Second Epistle of Peter]], the authorship of which was debated in antiquity, there was little debate about Peter's authorship of this first epistle until the 18th century. Although 2 Peter internally purports to be a work of the apostle, many biblical scholars have concluded that Peter is not the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=What Are They Saying About the Catholic Epistles? |first=Philip B. |last=Harner |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xenz0ZMWDNsC&amp;pg=PA49 |publisher=Paulist Press |year=2004|isbn=9780809141883 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For an early date and (usually) for a defense of the Apostle Peter's authorship see Kruger,&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, M.J.

The Epistle of Jude title is written as follows: "Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James" ([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]]). The debate has continued over the author's identity as the apostle, the brother of Jesus, both, or neither.&lt;ref&gt;Bauckham, R. J. (1986). ''Word Biblical Commentary, Vol. 50''. Word (UK) Ltd. p. 14f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Johannine works===
{{Main article|Authorship of the Johannine works}}
The [[First Epistle of John]] is traditionally held to have been composed by [[John the Apostle]] (the author of the [[Gospel of John]]) when the writer was in advanced age. The epistle's content, language and conceptual style indicate that it may have had the same author as the Gospel of John, 2 John and 3 John.&lt;ref name="Harris 1John"&gt;{{harvp|Harris|1985|loc="1 John"|pp=355–356}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius]] claimed that the author of 2nd and 3rd John was not [[John the Apostle]], but an "elder John" which refers either to the apostle at an advanced age or a hypothetical second individual ("[[John the Elder]]").&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius. "Chapter 39". [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm ''The Church History, Book III''].&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars today are divided on the issue.

===Revelation===
The author of the [[Book of Revelation]] identifies himself several times as "John".{{Bibleref2c|Rev.|1:1,4,9;22:8||Rev.&amp;nbsp;1:1,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;9;&amp;nbsp;22:8}} and states that he was on [[Patmos]] when he received his first vision.{{Bibleref2c|Rev.|1:9;4:1-2||Rev.&amp;nbsp;1:9;&amp;nbsp;4:1-2}} As a result, the author is sometimes referred to as [[John of Patmos]]. The author has traditionally been identified with [[John the Apostle]] to whom the [[Gospel of John|Gospel]] and the [[epistles of John]] were attributed. It was believed that he was exiled to the island of Patmos during the reign of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Domitian]], and there wrote Revelation. [[Justin Martyr]] (c. 100–165 AD) who was acquainted with [[Polycarp]], who had been mentored by John, makes a possible allusion to this book, and credits John as the source.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Martyr. ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. Chapter LXXXI.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus]] (c. 115–202) assumes it as a conceded point. According to the ''Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible'', modern scholars are divided between the apostolic view and several alternative hypotheses put forth in the last hundred years or so.&lt;ref&gt;Tenney, Merrill C., gen. ed. (2009). "Revelation, Book of the". ''Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible, Vol. 5 (Q-Z)''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Witherington]] points out that linguistic evidence makes it unlikely that the books were written by the same person.&lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben (2003). ''Revelation''. Cambridge University Press. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dates of composition==
:''See individual book articles for more detail.''
The earliest works that became part of the New Testament are the letters of the Apostle Paul. The earliest of the books of the New Testament was [[First Thessalonians]], an epistle of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], written probably in 51, or possibly [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] in 49 according to one of two theories of its writing.

In the 1830s German scholars of the [[Tübingen school]] tried to date the books as late as the 3rd century, but the discovery of some [[Biblical manuscript|New Testament manuscripts]] and fragments from the 2nd and 3rd centuries, one of which dates as early as 125 ([[Papyrus 52]]), disproves a 3rd-century date of composition for any book now in the New Testament. Additionally, a [[First Epistle of Clement|letter to the church at Corinth]] in the name of [[Clement I|Clement of Rome]] in 95 quotes from 10 of the 27 books of the New Testament, and a [[Polycarp's letter to the Philippians|letter to the church at Philippi in the name of Polycarp]] in 120 quotes from 16 books.  Therefore, some of the books of the New Testament must have been in circulation by the end of the first century.

Scholars hold a wide spectrum of views on exactly when the books of the new testament were written, with non-fundamentalist scholars tending to argue for later dates, and more conservative scholars arguing for an earlier one.  Most contemporary scholars regard [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] as a source used by Luke (see [[Marcan priority]]).&lt;ref&gt;Koester, Helmut (1999). ''Ancient Christian Gospels''. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Trinity Press International. p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; If it is true that Mark was written around the destruction of the [[Temple of Jerusalem]], around 70,&lt;ref name = "TM1998 Mark"&gt;Theissen, Gerd; Merz, Annette (1996). ''The Historical Jesus: A Comprehensive Guide''. Fortress Press. (1996 edition). p. 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt; they theorize that Luke would not have been written before 70. Some who take this view believe that Luke's prediction of the destruction of the temple could not be a result of Jesus predicting the future but with the benefit of hindsight regarding specific details. They believe that the [[Olivet Discourse]] in {{Bibleref2|Luke|21:5–30}} is specific enough (more specific than Mark's or Matthew's) that a date after 70 seems likely.&lt;ref name="ODCC self Matthew"&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. (2005). "Matthew, Gospel according to St". ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|S. Brown agrees that the references to the Jerusalem temple's destruction are seen as evidence of a post-70 date.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Schuyler. (1993). ''The Origins of Christianity: A Historical Introduction to the New Testament''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;}} These scholars have suggested dates for Luke from 75 to 100.

Support for a later date comes from a number of reasons. Differences of chronology, "style", and theology suggest that the author of Luke-Acts was not familiar with [[Pauline Christianity|Paul's distinctive theology]] but instead was writing a decade or more after his death, by which point significant harmonization between different traditions within [[Early Christianity]] had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Schuyler (1993). ''The Origins of Christianity: A Historical Introduction to the New Testament''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Luke-Acts has views on [[christology|Jesus' divine nature]], [[eschatology|the end times]], and [[soteriology|salvation]] that are similar to those found in [[Pastoral epistles]], which are often seen as [[pseudonym]]ous and of a later date than [[Authorship of the Pauline Epistles|the undisputed]] [[Pauline Epistles]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Schuyler (1993). ''The Origins of Christianity: A Historical Introduction to the New Testament''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most conservative scholars however, argue that both [[internal evidence|internal]] and [[external evidence|external]] evidence strongly points to dates prior to 70 AD for the [[Synoptic Gospels]], [[Book of Acts|Acts]], and the [[Pauline Epistles]].  They note that there is no mention of the deaths of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and [[James the Just|James]], all of which happened between 60–65 AD, in any book of the New Testament.  These were all extremely important figures in the [[Early Christianity|early church]], writers would have mentioned their deaths if the New Testament had been written later.&lt;ref name ="Robinson" /&gt;  Furthermore, the Gospels contain numerous attacks on the [[Sadducees]], a sect of Judaism that was wiped out with the destruction of the temple.  Why, they ask, would later writers devote so much narrative space to attacking a group that no longer existed?&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{cite web

[[John Robinson (bishop of Woolwich)|John Robinson]] also notes that each book of the New Testament had to be written prior to the destruction of The Temple.  Robinson notes that most scholars interpret the [[Olivet Discourse]] as a post 70 AD account of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|destruction of The Temple]], couched in language to make it appear to be a prophecy, culminating in the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus to end the world.  Robinson notes that the Second Coming did not occur after the destruction of The Temple, leading him to ask, why would a writer in the 80s or 90s forge a prophecy of an event that is proven not to have occurred 20 years earlier?&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite book| first = John Arthur Thomas | last = Robinson|title= Redating the New Testament|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CSMFAAAACAAJ|date= 1 October 2000| origyear = 1976 | publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock |isbn=978-1-57910-527-3 | author-mask = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
{{main article|Language of the New Testament}}
The major languages spoken by both Jews and Greeks in the [[Holy Land]] at the [[Cultural and historical background of Jesus|time of Jesus]] were [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic]] and [[Koine Greek]], and also a colloquial dialect of [[Mishnaic Hebrew]]. It is generally agreed by most scholars that the [[historical Jesus]] primarily spoke [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Eerdmans Bible Dictionary|title=Aramaic|quote=It is generally agreed that Aramaic was the common language of Israel in the 1st century AD. Jesus and his disciples spoke the Galilean dialect, which was distinguished from that of Jerusalem (Matt. 26:73).|page=72|isbn=0-8028-2402-1|editor=Myers, Allen C. |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|publisher=William B. Eerdmans|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps also some [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Koine Greek]]. The majority view is that all of the books that would eventually form the New Testament were written in the Koine Greek language.&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, Bruce M.; Ehrman, Bart D. (2005). ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration''. 4th ed. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aland, K.; Aland, B. (1995). ''The Text of the New Testament''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. {{ISBN|9780802840981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Early centers of Christianity|As Christianity spread]], these books were later translated into other languages, most notably, [[Latin]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], and [[Coptic language|Egyptian Coptic]]. However, some of the [[Church Fathers]]&lt;ref&gt;Koester, Helmut (1982). ''Introduction to the New Testament, Volume 2''. Philadelphia. p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; imply or claim that Matthew was originally written in [[Hebrew Gospel of Matthew|Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic Matthew|Aramaic]], and then soon after was written in Koine Greek. Nevertheless, the Gospel of Matthew known today was composed in Greek and is neither directly dependent upon nor a translation of a text in a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, W. D.; Allison, Dale C. (1988). ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on The Gospel according to Saint Matthew, Vol. 1''. Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark. pp. 33–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the New Testament canon==
{{Main article|Development of the New Testament canon}}
The process of canonization of the New Testament was complex and lengthy. In the initial centuries of [[early Christianity]], there were many books widely considered by the church to be inspired, but there was no single formally recognized New Testament canon.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius. "Chapter 25". [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm ''Church History, Book III''].&lt;/ref&gt; The process was characterized by a compilation of books that [[Sacred tradition|apostolic tradition]] considered authoritative in worship and teaching, relevant to the historical situations in which they lived, and consonant with the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Harry Y. (1985). ''The New Testament Canon: Its Making and Meaning''. Guides to Biblical Scholarship. Philadelphia: Fortress.&lt;/ref&gt; Writings attributed to the apostles circulated among the [[Early centers of Christianity|earliest Christian communities]] and the Pauline epistles were circulating, perhaps in collected forms, by the end of the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century AD]].&lt;ref&gt;Three forms are postulated, from ''The Canon Debate'', chapter 18, page 300, note 21, attributed to Harry Y. Gamble: "(1) Marcion's collection that begins with Galatians and ends with Philemon; (2) Papyrus 46, dated about 200, that follows the order that became established except for reversing Ephesians and Galatians; and (3) the letters to seven churches, treating those to the same church as one letter and basing the order on length, so that Corinthians is first and Colossians (perhaps including Philemon) is last."&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest attempts at solidifying a canon was made by [[Marcion]], ''circa'' 140 AD, who accepted only a modified version of Luke (the [[Gospel of Marcion]]) and ten of Paul's letters, while rejecting the Old Testament entirely. His canon was increasingly rejected by other groups of Christians, notably the [[Proto-orthodox Christianity|proto-orthodox Christians]], as was his theology, [[Marcionism]]. [[Adolf Harnack]] in ''Origin of the New Testament'' (1914) observed that the church gradually formulated its New Testament canon in response to the challenge posed by Marcion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harnack |first=Adolf |chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/origin_nt.v.vi.html |title=Origin of the New Testament |chapter=Appendix VI |publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]] and [[Tertullian]] held the letters of Paul to be on par with the Hebrew Scriptures as being divinely inspired, yet others rejected him. Other books were held in high esteem but were gradually relegated to the status of [[New Testament apocrypha]]. Justin Martyr, in the mid [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]], mentions "memoirs of the apostles" as being read on Sunday alongside the [[Nevi'im|"writings of the prophets"]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Justin Martyr. [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm ''First Apology'']. Chapter 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Muratorian fragment]], dated at between 170 and as late as the end of the 4th century (according to the [[Anchor Bible Series#Anchor Bible Dictionary|Anchor Bible Dictionary]]), may be the earliest known New Testament canon attributed to mainstream Christianity. It is similar, but not identical, to the modern New Testament canon.

The oldest clear endorsement of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John being the only legitimate gospels was written ''circa'' 180 AD. A four gospel canon (the ''Tetramorph'') was asserted by Irenaeus, who refers to it directly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Everett |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kxW-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT345 |chapter=Factors leading to the Selection and Closure of the New Testament Canon |editor-last1=McDonald |editor-first1=L.

For, since there are four zones of the world in which we live, and four principal winds, while the church is scattered throughout all the world, and the "pillar and ground" of the church is the gospel and the spirit of life; it is fitting that she should have four pillars, breathing out immortality on every side, and vivifying men afresh."&lt;ref name=AHIII8/&gt; The books considered to be authoritative by Irenaeus included the four gospels and many of the letters of Paul, although, based on the arguments Irenaeus made in support of only four authentic gospels, some interpreters deduce that the fourfold Gospel must have still been a novelty in Irenaeus's time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=McDonald |editor-first1=L.

===Origen (3rd century)===
By the early 200s, [[Origen]] may have been using the same twenty-seven books as in the Catholic New Testament canon, though there were still disputes over the canonicity of the Letter to the Hebrews, Epistle of James, II Peter, II John and III John and the Book of Revelation,&lt;ref&gt;Noll, Mark A. (1997). ''Turning Points''. Baker Academic. pp 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; known as the [[Antilegomena]]. Likewise, the [[Muratorian fragment]] is evidence that, perhaps as early as 200, there existed a set of Christian writings somewhat similar to the twenty-seven book NT canon, which included four gospels and argued against objections to them.&lt;ref&gt;de Jonge, H. J. (2003). "The New Testament Canon". In de Jonge, H. J.; Auwers, J. M (eds.). ''The Biblical Canons''. Leuven University Press. p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while there was a good measure of debate in the [[Early Church]] over the New Testament canon, the major writings are claimed to have been accepted by almost all Christians by the middle of the [[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of the Bible, Vol. 1 |author=Ackroyd, P. R.; Evans, C. F. (eds.) |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1970 |page=308 |ref={{harvid|Ackroyd|Evans|1970}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Origen was largely responsible for the collection of usage information regarding the texts that became the New Testament. The information used to create the late-4th-century [[Easter Letter]], which declared accepted Christian writings, was probably based on the ''Ecclesiastical History'' [HE] of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], wherein he uses the information passed on to him by Origen to create both his list at HE 3:25 and Origen's list at HE 6:25. Eusebius got his information about what texts were then accepted and what were then [[Antilegomena|disputed]], by the [[Early centers of Christianity|third-century churches throughout the known world]], a great deal of which Origen knew of firsthand from his extensive travels, from the library and writings of Origen.&lt;ref&gt;Bateman, C. G. (2010). [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1653073 "Origen’s Role in the Formation of the New Testament Canon"]. Social Science Research Network.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, Origen would have possibly included in his list of "inspired writings" other texts kept out by the likes of Eusebius—including the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], [[Shepherd of Hermas]], and [[1 Clement]]. Notwithstanding these facts, "Origen is not the originator of the idea of biblical canon, but he certainly gives the philosophical and literary-interpretative underpinnings for the whole notion."&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, John A. (2003). "Origen as Literary Critic in the Alexandrian Tradition". In Perrone, L. (ed.). ''Origeniana Octava: Origen and the Alexandrian Tradition, Vol. 1''. Bibliotheca Ephemeridum Theologicarum Lovaniensium 164. Leuven: Leuven University Press. pp. 121–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eusebius's Ecclesiastical History===
[[Eusebius]], ''circa'' 300, gave a detailed list of New Testament writings in his ''Ecclesiastical History'' [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-01/Npnf2-01-08.htm#P1497_696002 Book 3], Chapter XXV:
: "1... First then must be put the holy quaternion of the gospels; following them the Acts of the Apostles... the epistles of Paul... the epistle of John... the epistle of Peter... After them is to be placed, if it really seem proper, the Book of Revelation, concerning which we shall give the different opinions at the proper time. These then belong among the accepted writings."

: "3 Among the disputed writings, which are nevertheless recognized by many, are extant the so-called epistle of James and that of Jude, also the second epistle of Peter, and those that are called the second and third of John, whether they belong to the evangelist or to another person of the same name. Among the rejected [Kirsopp Lake translation: "not genuine"] writings must be reckoned also the [[Acts of Paul]], and the so-called [[Shepherd of Hermas|Shepherd]], and the [[Apocalypse of Peter]], and in addition to these the extant [[epistle of Barnabas]], and the so-called [[Didache|Teachings of the Apostles]]; and besides, as I said, the [[Book of Revelation|Apocalypse of John]], if it seem proper, which some, as I said, reject, but which others class with the accepted books. And among these some have placed also the [[Gospel of the Hebrews|Gospel according to the Hebrews]]... And all these may be reckoned among the disputed books."

: "6... such books as the [[Gospel of Peter|Gospels of Peter]], of [[Gospel of Thomas|Thomas]], of [[Gospel of Matthias|Matthias]], or of any others besides them, and the [[Acts of Andrew]] and [[Acts of John|John]] and the other apostles... they clearly show themselves to be the fictions of heretics. Wherefore they are not to be placed even among the rejected writings, but are all of them to be cast aside as absurd and impious."

The Book of Revelation is counted as both accepted (Kirsopp Lake translation: "Recognized") and disputed, which has caused some confusion over what exactly Eusebius meant by doing so. From other writings of the church fathers, it was disputed with several canon lists rejecting its canonicity. EH 3.3.5 adds further detail on Paul: "Paul's fourteen epistles are well known and undisputed. It is not indeed right to overlook the fact that some have rejected the Epistle to the Hebrews, saying that it is disputed by the church of Rome, on the ground that it was not written by Paul." EH 4.29.6 mentions the [[Diatessaron]]: "But their original founder, Tatian, formed a certain combination and collection of the gospels, I know not how, to which he gave the title Diatessaron, and which is still in the hands of some. But they say that he ventured to paraphrase certain words of the apostle Paul, in order to improve their style."

===4th century and later===
In his Easter letter of 367, [[Athanasius]], Bishop of Alexandria, gave a list of the books that would become the twenty-seven-book NT canon,&lt;ref name="LindbergCarter"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Christianity |first=Carter |last=Lindberg |page=15|year=2006|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=1-4051-1078-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he used the word "canonized" (''kanonizomena'') in regards to them.&lt;ref&gt;Brakke, David (Oct 1994). "Canon Formation and Social Conflict in Fourth Century Egypt: Athanasius of Alexandria's Thirty Ninth Festal Letter". ''Harvard Theological Review'' '''87''' (4): 395–419.&lt;/ref&gt; The first council that accepted the present canon of the New Testament may have been the [[Synod of Hippo|Synod of Hippo Regius]] in North Africa (393 AD); the acts of this council, however, are lost. A brief summary of the acts was read at and accepted by the [[Council of Carthage (397)]] and the [[Council of Carthage (419)]].&lt;ref name=McDonaldD2&gt;{{harvp|McDonald|Sanders|2002|loc=Appendix D-2, note 19}} "Revelation was added later in 419 at the subsequent synod of Carthage."&lt;/ref&gt; These councils were under the authority of [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], who regarded the canon as already closed.&lt;ref name=Ferguson320&gt;{{harvp|Ferguson|2002|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=F. F. |year=1988 |title=The Canon of Scripture |publisher=Intervarsity Press |page=230 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augustine. ''De Civitate Dei''. 22.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Damasus I]]'s [[Council of Rome]] in 382, if the ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]'' is correctly associated with it, issued a biblical canon identical to that mentioned above,&lt;ref name="LindbergCarter" /&gt; or, if not, the list is at least a 6th-century compilation.&lt;ref name="Bruce 1988 234"&gt;{{harvp|Bruce|1988|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Damasus' commissioning of the Latin [[Vulgate]] edition of the Bible, c. 383, was instrumental in the fixation of the canon in the West.&lt;ref name="Bruce 1988 225"&gt;{{harvp|Bruce|1988|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''c.'' 405, [[Pope Innocent I]] sent a list of the sacred books to a Gallic bishop, [[Exuperius|Exsuperius of Toulouse]]. Christian scholars assert that, when these [[bishops]] and councils spoke on the matter, however, they were not defining something new but instead "were ratifying what had already become the mind of the Church."&lt;ref name=Ferguson320/&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzger 1987 237–238"&gt;{{cite book |first=Bruce |last=Metzger |title=The Canon of the New Testament: Its Origins, Development, and Significance |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon |year=1987 |pages=237–238 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;{{harvp|Bruce|1988|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Testament canon as it is now was first listed by [[Athanasius of Alexandria|St. Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria]], in 367, in a letter written to his churches in Egypt, [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-04/Npnf2-04-93.htm Festal Letter 39]. Also cited is the [[Council of Rome]], but not without controversy. That canon gained wider and wider recognition until it was accepted at the [[Third Council of Carthage]] in 397 and 419.{{refn|group=note|The [[Book of Revelation]] wasn't added till the [[Council of Carthage (419)]].&lt;ref name=McDonaldD2/&gt;}}

Even this council did not settle the matter, however. Certain books, referred to as [[Antilegomena]], continued to be questioned, especially [[Epistle of James|James]] and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]. Even as late as the 16th century, the Reformer [[Martin Luther]] questioned (but in the end did not reject) the [[Epistle of James]], the [[Epistle of Jude]], the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] and the [[Book of Revelation]]. To this day, German-language [[Luther Bible]]s are printed with these four books at the end of the canon, rather than in their traditional order as in other editions of the Bible.

In light of this questioning of the canon of Scripture by Protestants in the 16th century, the (Roman Catholic) [[Council of Trent]] reaffirmed the traditional western canon (i.e., the canon accepted at the 4th-century [[Council of Rome]] and [[Council of Carthage]]), thus making the [[Canon of Trent]] and the [[Vulgate]] Bible [[Roman Catholic Dogma|dogma]] in the Catholic Church. Later, [[Pope Pius XI]] on 2 June 1927 decreed the [[Comma Johanneum]] was open to dispute and [[Pope Pius XII]] on 3 September 1943 issued the encyclical ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'', which allowed translations based on other versions than just the Latin [[Vulgate]], notably in English the [[New American Bible]].

Thus, some claim that, from the [[Christianity in the 4th century#Defining scripture|4th century]], there existed unanimity in the [[Western Church|West]] concerning the New Testament canon (as it is today),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bruce|1988|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that, by the [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century]], the [[Eastern Church]], with a few exceptions, had come to accept the [[Book of Revelation]] and thus had come into harmony on the matter of the canon.&lt;ref name="P. R. Ackroyd and C. F. Evans, eds. 1970 305"&gt;{{harvp|Ackroyd|Evans|1970|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, full dogmatic articulations of the canon were not made until the [[Canon of Trent]] of 1546 for [[Roman Catholicism]], the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of 1563 for the [[Church of England]], the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] of 1647 for [[Calvinism]], and the [[Synod of Jerusalem]] of 1672 for the [[Greek Orthodox]].

On the question of NT Canon formation generally, New Testament scholar Lee Martin McDonald has written that:&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Lee M. (1995). ''The Formation of the Christian Biblical Canon''. Peabody, Massachusetts: Hendrickson. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
Although a number of Christians have thought that [[church council]]s determined what books were to be included in the biblical canons, a more accurate reflection of the matter is that the councils recognized or acknowledged those books that had already obtained prominence from usage among the various early Christian communities.}}

Christian scholars assert that when these bishops and councils spoke on the matter, they were not defining something new, but instead "were ratifying what had already become the mind of the Church".&lt;ref name="Metzger 1987 237–238"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruce" /&gt;

Some synods of the 4th century published lists of canonical books (e.g. [[Synod of Hippo|Hippo]] and [[Council of Carthage|Carthage]]). The existing 27-book canon of the New Testament was reconfirmed (for [[Roman Catholicism]]) in the 16th century with the [[Council of Trent]] (also called the Tridentine Council) of 1546,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Metzger|1987|p=246}} "Finally on 8 April 1546, by a vote of 24 to 15, with 16 abstensions, the Council issued a decree (''De Canonicis Scripturis'') in which, for the first time in the history of the church, the question of the contents of the Bible was made an absolute article of faith and confirmed by an anathema."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of 1563 for the [[Church of England]], the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] of 1647 for [[Calvinism]], and the [[Synod of Jerusalem]] of 1672 for [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. Although these councils did include statements about the canon, when it came to the New Testament they were only reaffirming the existing canon, including the [[Antilegomena]].

According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' article on the Canon of the New Testament: "The idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from the beginning, that is from Apostolic times, has no foundation in history. The Canon of the New Testament, like that of the Old, is the result of a development, of a process at once stimulated by disputes with doubters, both within and without the Church, and retarded by certain obscurities and natural hesitations, and which did not reach its final term until the dogmatic definition of the [[Council of Trent|Tridentine Council]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reid |first=George |year=1908 |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03274a.htm |chapter=Canon of the New Testament |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 331, [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine I]] commissioned Eusebius to deliver [[Fifty Bibles of Constantine|fifty Bibles]] for the [[Church of Constantinople]]. [[Athanasius]] (''Apol. Const. 4'') recorded Alexandrian scribes around 340 preparing Bibles for [[Constans]]. Little else is known, though there is plenty of speculation. For example, it is speculated that this may have provided motivation for canon lists, and that [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]] may be examples of these Bibles. Together with the [[Peshitta]] and [[Codex Alexandrinus]], these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonald|Sanders|2002|pp=414–415}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence among the [[First Council of Nicaea#The biblical canon|canons of the First Council of Nicaea of any determination on the canon]].

{{Main article|New Testament manuscripts}}

Like other literature from [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], the text of the New Testament was (prior to the advent of the [[printing press]]) preserved and transmitted in [[manuscripts]]. Manuscripts containing at least a part of the New Testament number in the thousands. The earliest of these (like manuscripts containing other literature) are often very fragmentarily preserved. Some of these fragments have even been thought to date as early as the 2nd century (i.e., [[Papyrus 90]], [[Papyrus 98]], [[Papyrus 104]], and famously [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]], though the early date of the latter has recently been called into question).&lt;ref&gt;For the initial dating of P52, see Roberts, C. H. (ed.) (1935). ''An Unpublished Fragment of the Fourth Gospel in the John Rylands Library''. Manchester: Manchester University Press; and Bell, H. Idris; Skeat, T. C. (1935). ''Fragments of an Unknown Gospel and Other Early Christian Papyri''. London: Trustees of the British Museum. Though see now Nongbri, Brent (2005). "The Use and Abuse of P52: Papyrological Pitfalls in the Dating of the Fourth Gospel". ''Harvard Theological Review'' '''98''': 23–52; and Martinez, David G. (2009). "The Papyri and Early Christianity". In Bagnall, Roger S. (ed.). ''The Oxford Handbook of Papyrology''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 590–623.&lt;/ref&gt;

For each subsequent century, more and more manuscripts survive that contain a portion or all of the books that were held to be part of the New Testament at that time (for example, the New Testament of the 4th-century [[Codex Sinaiticus]], once a complete Bible, contains the [[Epistle of Barnabas]] and the [[Shepherd of Hermas]]), though occasionally these manuscripts contain other works as well (e.g., [[Papyrus 72]] and the Crosby-Schøyen Codex). The date when a manuscript was written, however, does not necessarily reflect the date of the form of text it contains. That is, later manuscripts can, and occasionally do, contain older forms of text or older readings.

Some of the more important manuscripts containing an early text of books of the New Testament are:

*The [[Chester Beatty Papyri]] (Greek; the New Testament portions of which were copied in the 3rd century)
*The [[Bodmer Papyri]] (Greek and Coptic; the New Testament portions of which were copied in the 3rd and 4th centuries)
*[[Codex Bobiensis]] (Latin; copied in the 4th century, but containing at least a 3rd-century form of text)
*[[Uncial 0171|Uncial '''0171''']] (Greek; copied in the late-third or early 4th century)
*[[Syriac Sinaiticus]] (Syriac; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Schoyen Collection|Schøyen Manuscript]] 2560 (Coptic; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Codex Vaticanus]] (Greek; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Codex Sinaiticus]] (Greek; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Codex Vercellensis]] (Latin; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Curetonian Gospels]] (Syriac; copied in the 5th century)
*[[Garima Gospels]] ( [[Ge'ez language]], produced in the 5th through 6th century)

==Textual variation==
{{Main article|Textual variants in the New Testament|Textual criticism of the New Testament}}
[[Textual criticism]] deals with the identification and removal of [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] errors in the [[Writing|texts]] of [[manuscripts]]. Ancient [[scribes]] made errors or alterations (such as including non-authentic [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|additions]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ehrman|2005|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Testament has been preserved in more than 5,800 [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts, 10,000 [[Latin]] manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages including [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Ethiopic]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. Even if the [[Greek New Testament|original Greek]] versions were lost, the entire New Testament could still be assembled from the translations.&lt;ref name="Strobel, Lee 1998"&gt;Strobel, Lee (1998). ''The Case for Christ''. Chapter Three, when quoting biblical scholar [[Bruce Metzger]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are so many quotes from the New Testament in early church documents and commentaries that the entire New Testament could also be assembled from these alone.&lt;ref name="Strobel, Lee 1998"/&gt; Not all biblical manuscripts come from orthodox Christian writers. For example, the [[Gnostic]] writings of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] come from the 2nd century AD, and these Christians were regarded as heretics by the mainstream church.&lt;ref name="Bruce, F.F. 1981 P 14"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=F.F. |year=1981 |title=The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable? |publisher=InterVarsity Press |page=14 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sheer number of witnesses presents unique difficulties, but it also gives scholars a better idea of how close modern Bibles are to the original versions.&lt;ref name="Bruce, F.F. 1981 P 14"/&gt;

On noting the large number of surviving ancient manuscripts, [[Bruce Metzger]] sums up the view on the issue by saying "The more often you have copies that agree with each other, especially if they emerge from different geographical areas, the more you can cross-check them to figure out what the original document was like. The only way they'd agree would be where they went back genealogically in a family tree that represents the descent of the manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Strobel, Lee 1998"/&gt;

===Interpolations===
In attempting to determine the original text of the New Testament books, some modern textual critics have identified sections as additions of material, centuries after the gospel was written. These are called [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolations]]. In modern translations of the Bible, the results of textual criticism have led to certain verses, words and phrases being left out or marked as not original. According to [[Bart D. Ehrman]], "These scribal additions are often found in late medieval manuscripts of the New Testament, but not in the manuscripts of the earlier centuries."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |last=Ehrman |first=Bart D. |authorlink=Bart D. Ehrman |year=2005 |title=Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why |titlelink=Misquoting Jesus |publisher=HarperCollins |page=265 |isbn=978-0-06-073817-4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern Bibles have footnotes to indicate passages that have disputed source documents. Bible Commentaries also discuss these, sometimes in great detail. While many variations have been discovered between early copies of biblical texts, almost all have no importance, as they are variations in spelling, punctuation, or grammar. Also, many of these variants are so particular to the Greek language that they would not appear in translations into other languages. For example, order of words (i.e. "man bites dog" versus "dog bites man") often does not matter in Greek, so textual variants that flip the order of words often have no consequences.&lt;ref name="Strobel, Lee 1998"/&gt;

Outside of these unimportant variants, there are a couple variants of some importance. The two most commonly cited examples are the [[Mark 16|last verses]] of the ''Gospel of Mark''&lt;ref&gt;Nave, Guy D. ''The Role and Function of Repentance in Luke-Acts''. p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spong, John Shelby (26 September 1979).

[[File:RossanoGospelsChristBeforePilate.jpg|thumb|The [[Rossano Gospels]], 6th century, a representative of [[Byzantine]] text.]]

The often referred to Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible, a book written to prove the validity of the New Testament, says: " A study of 150 Greek [manuscripts] of the Gospel of Luke has revealed more than 30,000 different readings... It is safe to say that there is not one sentence in the New Testament in which the [manuscript] is wholly uniform."&lt;ref&gt;Parvis, M. M. Vol. 4. pp. 594–595.{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the variation took place within the first three Christian centuries.

===Text-types===
By the 4th century, textual "families" or types of text become discernible among [[biblical manuscript|New Testament manuscripts]]. A "text-type" is the name given to a family of texts with similar readings due to common ancestors and mutual correction. Many early manuscripts, however, contain individual readings from several different earlier forms of text. Modern texual critics have identified the following text-types among textual witnesses to the New Testament: The [[Alexandrian text-type]] is usually considered to generally preserve many early readings. It is represented, e.g., by [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]], [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and the [[Bodmer Papyri]].

The [[Western text-type]] is generally longer and can be paraphrastic, but can also preserve early readings. The [[Acts of the Apostles#Manuscripts|Western version of the Acts of the Apostles]] is, notably, 8.5% longer than the Alexandrian form of the text. Examples of the Western text are found in [[Codex Bezae]], [[Codex Claromontanus]], [[Codex Washingtonianus]], the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] (i.e., Latin translations made prior to the [[Vulgate]]), as well as in quotations by [[Marcion]], [[Tatian]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Cyprian]].

A text-type referred to as the "[[Caesarean text-type]]" and thought to have included witnesses such as [[Codex Koridethi]] and minuscule 565, can today be described neither as "Caesarean" nor as a text-type as was previously thought. However, the Gospel of Mark in [[Papyrus 45]], [[Codex Washingtonianus]] and in [[Family 13]] does indeed reflect a distinct type of text.

Increasing standardization of distinct (and once local) text-types eventually gave rise to the [[Byzantine text-type]]. Since most manuscripts of the New Testament do not derive from the first several centuries, that is, they were copied after the rise of the Byzantine text-type, this form of text is found the majority of extant manuscripts and is therefore often called the "Majority Text." As with all of the other (earlier) text-types, the Byzantine can also occasionally preserve early readings.

===Biblical criticism===
{{Main article|Biblical criticism}}
[[Biblical criticism]] is the scholarly "study and investigation of [[Biblical manuscript|biblical writings]] that seeks to make discerning judgments about these writings." Viewing biblical texts as having human rather than supernatural origins, it asks when and where a particular text originated; how, why, by whom, for whom, and in what circumstances it was produced; what influences were at work in its production; what sources were used in its composition; and what message it was intended to convey.

It will vary slightly depending on whether the focus is on the [[Old Testament]], the letters of the New Testament, or the [[Canonical Gospels]]. It also plays an important role in the quest for the [[historical Jesus]]. It also addresses the physical text, including the meaning of the words and the way in which they are used, its preservation, history, and integrity. Biblical criticism draws upon a wide range of scholarly disciplines including [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], [[folklore]], [[linguistics]], [[Christian Oral Tradition|Oral Tradition studies]], history, and [[religious studies]].

===Establishing a critical text===
{{Main article|New Testament manuscripts}}
The [[#Textual variation|textual variation]] among manuscript copies of books in the New Testament prompted attempts to discern the earliest form of text already in antiquity (e.g., by the 3rd-century Christian author [[Origen]]). The efforts began in earnest again during the [[Renaissance]], which saw a revival of the study of ancient Greek texts. During this period, modern [[textual criticism]] was born. In this context, [[Christian humanism|Christian humanists]] such as [[Lorenzo Valla]] and [[Erasmus]] promoted a return to the original Greek of the New Testament. This was the beginning of modern [[New Testament textual criticism]], which over subsequent centuries would increasingly incorporate more and more manuscripts, in more languages (i.e., versions of the New Testament), as well as citations of the New Testament by ancient authors and the New Testament text in [[lectionary|lectionaries]] in order to reconstruct the earliest recoverable form of the New Testament text and the history of changes to it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger|Metzger, Bruce M.]]; [[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]] (2005). ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration''. 4th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to earlier and contemporaneous literature==
{{Further information|Non-canonical books referenced in the Bible}}
Books that later formed the New Testament, like other Christian literature of the period, originated in a literary context that reveals relationships not only to other Christian writings, but also to [[Classics|Graeco-Roman]] and [[Judaism#Antiquity|Jewish]] works. Of singular importance is the extensive use of and interaction with the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]] and what would become the [[Old Testament|Christian Old Testament]]. Both implicit and explicit citations, as well as countless allusions, appear throughout the books of the New Testament, from the Gospels and Acts, to the Epistles, to the Apocalypse.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Stendahl, Krister (1954). ''The School of St. Matthew and Its Use of the Old Testament''. Uppsala and Lund; Marcus, Joel (1993). ''The Way of the Lord: Christological Exegesis of the Old Testament in the Gospel of Mark''. Edinburgh; Smith, D. Moody (1972). "The Use of the Old Testament in the New". In ''The Use of the Old Testament in the New and Other Essays: Studies in Honor of William Franklin Stinespring''. Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press. pp. 3–65; [[Donald Juel|Juel, Donald]] (1988). ''Messianic Exegesis: Christological Interpretation of the Old Testament in Early Christianity''. Philadelphia: Fortress; and Barr, James (1966). ''Old and New in Interpretation: A Study of the Two Testaments''. London: SCM.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early versions==
The first translations (usually called "versions") of the New Testament were made beginning already at the end of 2nd century. The earliest versions of the New Testament are the translations into the [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Latin]], and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Võõbus|Võõbus, Arthur]] (1954). ''Early Versions of the New Testament''. Stockholm. pp. 1–128, 211–240.&lt;/ref&gt; These three versions were made directly from the Greek, and are frequently cited in the apparatuses of modern critical editions.

===Syriac===
{{Main article|Syriac versions of the Bible}}
[[File:RabulaGospelsFolio04vCanonTable.jpg|thumb|The [[Rabbula Gospels]], [[Eusebian Canons]].]]
Syriac was spoken in [[Syria]], and [[Mesopotamia]], and with dialect in [[Syria Palaestina|Roman]] and [[Palaestina Secunda|Byzantine Palestine]] where it was known as [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic]]. Several Syriac translations were made and have come to us. Most of the Old Syriac, however, as well as the Philoxonian version have been lost.

[[Tatian]], the Assyrian, created the [[Diatessaron]], a [[gospel harmony]] written in Syriac around 170 AD and the earliest form of the gospel not only in Syriac but probably also in Armenian.

In the 19th century, manuscript evidence was discovered for an "Old Syriac" version of the four distinct (i.e., not harmonized) gospels. These "separated" (Syriac: ''da-Mepharreshe'') gospels, though old, have been shown to be later than the Diatessaron. The Old Syriac gospels are fragmentarily preserved in two manuscripts: the 5th-century [[Curetonian Gospels|Curetonian Syriac]] and the [[Syriac Sinaiticus|Sinaitic Syriac]] from the 4th or 5th century.

No Old Syriac manuscripts of other portions of the New Testament survive, though Old Syriac readings, e.g. from the [[Pauline Epistles]], can be discerned in citations made by Eastern fathers and in later Syriac versions. The Old Syriac version is a representative of the [[Western text-type]]. The [[Peshitta]] version was prepared in the beginning of the 5th century. It contains only 22 books (neither the [[General epistles|Minor Catholic Epistles]] of 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, and Jude, nor the [[Book of Revelation]] were part of this translation).

The [[Philoxenian]] probably was produced in 508 for [[Philoxenus, Bishop of Mabung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzger |first=Bruce M. |authorlink=Bruce M. Metzger |year=1977 |title=The Early Versions of the New Testament |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |pages=3–98 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin===
{{Main article|Vetus Latina|Vulgate}}
The Gospels were likely translated into Latin as early as the last quarter of the 2nd century in North Africa (''Afra''). Not much later, there were also European Latin translations (''Itala''). There are about 80 Old Latin mansucripts. The [[Vetus Latina]] ("Old Latin") versions often contain readings with a Western type of text. (For the avoidance of confusion, these texts were written in [[Late Latin]], not the early version of the Latin language known as [[Old Latin]], pre 75 BC.)

The bewildering diversity of the Old Latin versions prompted [[Jerome]] to prepare another translation into Latin&amp;nbsp;— the [[Vulgate]]. In many respects it was merely a revision of the Old Latin. There are currently around 8,000 manuscripts of the Vulgate.

===Coptic===
{{Main article|Coptic versions of the Bible}}
There are several dialects of the Coptic language: [[Bohairic]] (northern dialect), [[Fayyumic]], [[Sahidic]] (southern dialect), [[Akhmimic]], and others. The first translation was made by at least the 3rd century into the Sahidic dialect (cop&lt;sup&gt;sa&lt;/sup&gt;). This translation represents a mixed text, mostly [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]], though also with [[Western text-type|Western]] readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vööbus |first=Arthur |year=1954 |title=Early Versions of the New Testament |location=Stockholm |pages=216–229 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Bohairic translation was made later, but existed already in the 4th century. Though the translation makes less use of Greek words than the Sahidic, it does employ some Greek grammar (e.g., in word-order and the use of particles such as the syntactic construction μεν&amp;nbsp;— δε). For this reason, the Bohairic translation can be helpful in the reconstruction of the early Greek text of the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vööbus|1954|pp=229–237}}; {{harvp|Metzger|1977|pp=99–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other ancient translations===
[[File:Matthew's Gospel - British Library Add. MS 59874 Ethiopian Bible.jpg|thumb|BL Add. MS 59874 with [[Ethiopic]] [[Gospel of Matthew]].]]
The continued spread of Christianity, and the foundation of national churches, led to the translation of the Bible—often beginning with books from the New Testament—into a variety of other languages at a relatively early date: [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Ethiopic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Soghdian]], and eventually [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Church Slavonic language|Old Church Slavonic]], [[Arabic]], and [[Nubian languages|Nubian]].&lt;ref&gt;On the Armenian, Georgian, Ethiopic, Arabic, and Gothic, see {{harvp|Vööbus|1954|loc=pp. 133–210, 243–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern translations==
{{Main article|Bible translations}}
[[Modern Literal Version]] is the most recent literal translation of the books of the new testament, with the largest number of translation experts being involved in the final translation.

Historically, throughout the [[Christendom|Christian world]] and in the context of [[Mission (Christian)|Christian missionary activity]], the New Testament (or portions thereof) has been that part of the Christian Bible first translated into the [[vernacular]]. The production of such translations grew out of the insertion of [[vernacular]] [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] in biblical texts, as well as out of the production of [[biblical paraphrase]]s and poetic renditions of stories from the life of Christ (e.g., the [[Heliand]]).

The 16th century saw the rise of [[Protestantism]] and an explosion of translations of the New (and Old) Testament into the [[vernacular]]. Notable are those of [[Luther Bible|Martin Luther]] (1522), [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]] (1523), the [[Zürich Bible|Froschau Bible]] (1525–1529, revised in 1574), [[Tyndale Bible|William Tyndale]] (1526, revised in 1534, 1535 and 1536), the [[Brest Bible]] (1563), and the [[Authorized King James Version|Authorized Version]] (also called the "King James Version") (1611).

Most of these translations relied (though not always exclusively) upon one of the printed editions of the Greek New Testament edited by [[Erasmus]], a form of this Greek text emerged as the standard and is known as the [[Textus Receptus]]. This text, based on the majority of manuscripts is also used in the majority of translations that were made in the years 100 to 400 AD.

Translations of the New Testament made since the appearance of critical editions of the Greek text (notably those of [[Constantin von Tischendorf|Tischendorf]], [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott and Hort]], and [[Von Soden catalogue|von Soden]]) have largely used them as their [[Source text|base text]]. Unlike the [[Textus Receptus]], these have a pronounced Alexandrian character. Standard critical editions are those of [[Alexander Souter|Souter]], Vogels, Bover, Merk, and [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestlé-Aland]] (the text, though not the full critical apparatus of which is reproduced in the [[United Bible Societies]]' "Greek New Testament").

Notable translations of the New Testament based on these most recent critical editions include the [[Revised Standard Version]] (1946, revised in 1971), [[:fr:La Bible de Jérusalem|La Bible de Jérusalem]] (1961, revised in 1973 and 2000), the [[Einheitsübersetzung]] (1970, final edition 1979), the [[New American Bible]] (1970, revised in 1986), the [[Traduction Oecuménique de la Bible]] (1988, revised in 2004), and the [[New Revised Standard Version]] (1989).

==Theological interpretation in Christian churches==
{{Main article|Biblical authority}}
Though all Christian churches accept the New Testament as scripture, they differ in their understanding of the nature, extent, and relevance of its authority. Views of the authoritativeness of the New Testament often depend on the concept of ''[[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]]'', which relates to the role of God in the formation of the New Testament. Generally, the greater the role of God in one's doctrine of inspiration, the more one accepts the [[doctrine]] of [[biblical inerrancy]] or authoritativeness of the Bible. One possible source of confusion is that these terms are difficult to define, because many people use them interchangeably or with very different meanings. This article will use the terms in the following manner:
*''Infallibility'' relates to the absolute correctness of the Bible in matters of doctrine.
*''Inerrancy'' relates to the absolute correctness of the Bible in factual assertions (including historical and scientific assertions).
*''Authoritativeness'' relates to the correctness of the Bible in questions of practice in morality.

{{Quotation|The self-witness of the Bible to its inspiration demands a commitment to its unity. The ultimate basis for unity is contained in the claim of divine inspiration in {{Bibleref2|2tim|3:16||2&amp;nbsp;Timothy 3:16}} that "all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" (KJV). The term "inspiration" renders the Greek word ''theopneustos''. This term only occurs here in the New Testament and literally means "God-breathed" (the chosen translation of the NIV).&lt;ref name=Elwell&gt;Meadors, Gary T. (1997). [http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/bakers-evangelical-dictionary/scripture-unity-and-diversity-of.html "Scripture, Unity and Diversity of"]. In Elwell, Walter A. (ed.). ''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology.'' Grand Rapids: Baker Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  }}

All of these concepts depend for their meaning on the supposition that the text of Bible has been properly interpreted, with consideration for the intention of the text, whether [[literal and figurative language|literal]] history, [[allegory]] or poetry, etc. Especially the doctrine of inerrancy is variously understood according to the weight given by the interpreter to scientific investigations of the world.

===Unity in diversity===
The notion of unity in diversity of Scripture claims that the Bible presents a noncontradictory and consistent message concerning God and redemptive history. The fact of diversity is observed in comparing the diversity of time, culture, authors' perspectives, literary genre, and the theological themes.&lt;ref name=Elwell/&gt;

Studies from many theologians considering the "unity in diversity" to be found in the New Testament (and the Bible as a whole) have been collected and summarized by New Testament theologian [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]]. He describes them as some basic presuppositions, tenets, and concerns common among the New Testament writers, giving to the New Testament its "unity in diversity":
#The reality of God is never argued but is always assumed and affirmed
#Jesus Christ is absolutely central: he is Lord and Savior, the foretold Prophet, the Messianic King, the Chosen, the way, the truth, and the light, the One through whom God the Father not only acted but through whom He came
#The Holy Spirit came anew with Jesus Christ.
#The Christian faith and life are a calling, rooted in divine election.
#The plight of everyone as sinner means that each person is completely dependent upon the mercy and grace of God
#Salvation is both God's gift and his demand through Jesus Christ, to be received by faith
#The death and resurrection of Jesus are at the heart of the total event of which he was the center
#God creates a people of his own, designated and described by varied terminology and analogies
#History must be understood eschatologically, being brought along toward its ultimate goal when the kingdom of God, already present in Christ, is brought to its complete triumph
#In Christ, all of God's work of creation, revelation, and redemption is brought to fulfillment&lt;ref name=Stagg&gt;Stagg, Frank (1962). ''New Testament Theology''. Broadman. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Classical Anglicanism===
For the [[Roman Catholic Church]], there are two modes of Revelation: Scripture and [[Apostolic Tradition|Tradition]]. Both of them are interpreted by the teachings of the Church. The Roman Catholic view is expressed clearly in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] (1997):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
§ 82: As a result the Church, to whom the transmission and interpretation of Revelation is entrusted, does not derive her certainty about all revealed truths from the holy Scriptures alone. Both Scripture and Tradition must be accepted and honoured with equal sentiments of devotion and reverence.
&lt;br /&gt;
§ 107: The inspired books teach the truth. Since therefore all that the inspired authors or sacred writers affirm should be regarded as affirmed by the Holy Spirit, we must acknowledge that the books of Scripture firmly, faithfully, and without error teach that truth which God, for the sake of our salvation, wished to see confided to the Sacred Scriptures.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;In Catholic terminology the teaching office is called the [[Magisterium]].  The Catholic view should not be confused with the two-source theory.  As the Catechism states in §§ 80 and 81, Revelation has "one common source ... two distinct modes of transmission."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c2a2.htm "The Transmission of Divine Revelation"]. ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''. 2nd ed. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

While many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] writers distinguish between Scripture and Tradition, Bishop Kallistos Ware says that for the Orthodox there is only one source of the Christian faith, Holy Tradition, within which Scripture exists.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Kallistos (1993). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2Z8bVDVMLEC&amp;pg=PT243 "Holy Tradition: The Source of the Orthodox Faith"].''The Orthodox Church''. Penguin UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional [[Anglican Communion|Anglicans]] believe that "Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation", (Article VI), but also that the Catholic Creeds "ought thoroughly to be received and believed" (Article VIII), and that the Church "hath authority in Controversies of Faith" and is "a witness and keeper of Holy Writ" (Article XX).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anglicansonline.org/basics/thirty-nine_articles.html |title=Articles of Religion |publisher=Anglicans Online |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical Anglicanism, therefore, like Orthodoxy, holds that Holy Tradition is the only safe guardian against perversion and innovation in the interpretation of Scripture.

In the famous words of Thomas Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells: "As for my religion, I dye in the holy catholic and apostolic faith professed by the whole Church before the disunion of East and West, more particularly in the communion of the Church of England, as it stands distinguished from all Papal and Puritan innovations, and as it adheres to the doctrine of the Cross."

===Protestantism===
Following the doctrine of [[sola scriptura]], Protestants believe that their traditions of faith, practice and interpretations carry forward what the scriptures teach, and so tradition is not a source of authority in itself. Their traditions derive authority from the Bible, and are therefore always open to reëvaluation. This openness to doctrinal revision has extended in [[Liberal Christianity|Liberal]] Protestant traditions even to the reevaluation of the doctrine of Scripture upon which the Reformation was founded, and members of these traditions may even question whether the Bible is infallible in doctrine, inerrant in historical and other factual statements, and whether it has uniquely divine authority. However, the adjustments made by modern [[Protestantism|Protestants]] to their doctrine of scripture vary widely.

====American evangelical and fundamentalist Protestantism====
Within the US, the [[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]] (1978) is a statement, articulating evangelical views on this issue. Paragraph four of its summary states: "Being wholly and verbally God-given, Scripture is without error or fault in all its teaching, no less in what it states about God's acts in creation, about the events of world history, and about its own literary origins under God, than in its witness to God's saving grace in individual lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformed.org/documents/index.html?mainframe=http://www.reformed.org/documents/icbi.html |title=The Chicago Statement of Biblical Inerrancy |publisher=Center for Reformed Theology and Apologetics |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====American mainline and liberal Protestantism====
[[Mainline (Protestant)|Mainline]] American [[Protestant]] denominations, including the [[United Methodist Church]], [[Presbyterian Church USA]], [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|The Episcopal Church]], and [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], do not teach the doctrine of inerrancy as set forth in the Chicago Statement. All of these churches have more ancient doctrinal statements asserting the authority of scripture, but may interpret these statements in such a way as to allow for a very broad range of teaching—from evangelicalism to skepticism. It is not an impediment to ordination in these denominations to teach that the scriptures contain errors, or that the authors follow a more or less unenlightened ethics that, however appropriate it may have seemed in the authors' time, moderns would be very wrong to follow blindly.

For example, [[ordination of women]] is universally accepted in the mainline churches, [[abortion]] is condemned as a grievous social tragedy but not always a personal [[sin]] or a crime against an unborn person, and [[homosexuality]] is sometimes recognized as a genetic propensity or morally neutral preference that should be neither encouraged nor condemned. In North America, the most contentious of these issues among these churches at the present time is how far the ordination of gay men and lesbians should be accepted.

Officials of the Presbyterian Church USA report: "We acknowledge the role of scriptural authority in the Presbyterian Church, but Presbyterians generally do not believe in biblical inerrancy. Presbyterians do not insist that every detail of chronology or sequence or prescientific description in scripture be true in literal form. Our confessions do teach biblical infallibility. Infallibility affirms the entire truthfulness of scripture without depending on every exact detail."&lt;ref&gt;"Homosexual ordination vote widens gap between Presbyterian factions". ''ReligionToday''. 20 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who hold a more liberal view of the Bible as a human witness to the glory of God, the work of fallible humans who wrote from a limited experience unusual only for the insight they have gained through their inspired struggle to know God in the midst of a troubled world. Therefore, they tend not to accept such doctrines as inerrancy. These churches also tend to retain the social activism of their evangelical forebears of the 19th century, placing particular emphasis on those teachings of scripture that teach compassion for the poor and concern for [[social justice]].

The message of personal [[salvation]] is, generally speaking, of the good that comes to oneself and the world through following the New Testament's [[ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]] admonition to love others without hypocrisy or prejudice. Toward these ends, the "spirit" of the New Testament, more than the letter, is infallible and authoritative.

There are some movements that believe the Bible contains the teachings of Jesus but who reject the churches that were formed following its publication. These people believe all individuals can communicate directly with God and therefore do not need guidance or doctrines from a church. These people are known as [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]].

===Messianic Judaism===
[[Messianic Judaism]] generally holds the same view of New Testament authority as evangelical Protestants.&lt;ref name = "Beit Simcha"&gt;{{cite web

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] accept the New Testament as divinely inspired Scripture, and as infallible in every detail, with equal authority as the Hebrew Scriptures. They view it as the written revelation and good news of the [[Messiah]], the [[Atonement in Christianity|ransom sacrifice of Jesus]], and the [[Kingdom of God]], explaining and expounding the Hebrew Bible, not replacing but vitally supplementing it. They also view the New Testament as the primary instruction guide for Christian living, and [[church discipline]]. They generally call the New Testament the "Christian Greek Scriptures", and see only the "covenants" as "old" or "new", but not any part of the actual Scriptures themselves.&lt;ref&gt;"Equipped For Every Good Work". Brooklyn, New York: Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, Inc. International Bible Students Association. 1946. pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Pentecostals===
[[Oneness Pentecostalism]] subscribes to the common Protestant doctrine of ''[[sola scriptura]]''. They view the Bible as the inspired Word of God, and as absolutely [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]] in its contents (though not necessarily in every translation).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite web |last=Raddatz |first=Tom |url=http://www.1lord1faith.org/wm/Oneness/1TrinDebate.htm |title=A Response to the Oneness-Trinity Debate |publisher=1Lord1Faith.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050320000616/http://www.1lord1faith.org/wm/Oneness/1TrinDebate.htm |archivedate=20 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dulle, Jason.

===Seventh-Day Adventists===
The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] holds the New Testament as the inspired Word of God, with God influencing the "thoughts" of the Apostles in the writing, not necessarily every word though.  The first fundamental belief of the Seventh-Day Adventist church stated that "The Holy Scriptures are the [[Biblical infallibility|infallible]] revelation of [God's] will." [[Seventh-day Adventist theology|Adventist theologians]] generally reject the "verbal inspiration" position on Scripture held by many conservative [[evangelical Christians]]. They believe instead that God inspired the thoughts of the biblical authors and apostles, and that the writers then expressed these thoughts in their own words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seventh-day Adventists Believe|author=Ministerial Association, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists |year=2005 |publisher=Pacific Press Publishing Association |edition=2nd |pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is popularly known as "thought inspiration", and most Adventist members hold to that view. According to Ed Christian, former ''[[Journal of the Adventist Theological Society|JATS]]'' editor, "few if any [[Adventist Theological Society|ATS]] members believe in verbal inerrancy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McLarty |first=John |url=http://www.atoday.com/magazine/2001/11/adventist-theological-society-0 |title=The Adventist Theological Society |work=Adventist Today |date=15 November 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225063148/http://www.atoday.com/magazine/2001/11/adventist-theological-society-0 |archivedate=25 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the teachings of the New Testament compared to the Old, and the application in the New Covenant, Adventists have traditionally taught that the [[Ethical Decalogue|Decalogue]] is part of the moral law of God, which was not abrogated by the ministry and death of [[Jesus Christ]]. Therefore, the fourth commandment concerning the Sabbath is as applicable to Christian believers as the other nine. Adventists have often taught a distinction between "moral law" and "ceremonial law". According to Adventist beliefs, the moral law continues into the "New Testament era", but the ceremonial law was done away with by Jesus.

How the [[Mosaic law]] should be applied came up at Adventist conferences in the past, and Adventist theologians such as [[A. T. Jones]] and [[E. J. Waggoner]] looked at the problem addressed by Paul in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] as not the ceremonial law, but rather the wrong use of the law ([[legalism (theology)|legalism]]). They were opposed by [[Uriah Smith]] and [[George Ide Butler|George Butler]] at the 1888 Conference. Smith in particular thought the Galatians issue had been settled by Ellen White already, yet in 1890 she claimed justification by faith is "the [[Three Angels' Messages|third angel's message]] in verity."{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==In the liturgy==
[[File:Codex Harcleianus.PNG|thumb|right|A Byzantine lectionary, ''[[Lectionary 150|Codex Harleianus]]'' (''l''&lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt;), 995 AD, text of John 1:18.]] Despite the wide variety among [[Christian liturgy|Christian liturgies]], texts from the New Testament play a role in almost all forms of [[Christian worship]]. In addition to some language derived from the New Testament in the [[liturgy]] itself (e.g., the [[Trisagion]] may be based on Apocalypse 4:8, and the beginning of the "Hymn of Praise" draws upon Luke 2:14), the reading of extended passages from the New Testament is a practice common to almost all [[Christian worship]], liturgical or not.

These [[Lection|readings]] are most often part of an established [[lectionary]] (i.e., [[Lection|selected texts]] to be read at church services on specific days), and (together with an Old Testament reading and a [[Psalms (Christian)|Psalm]]) include a non-gospel reading from the New Testament and culminate with a [[Gospel (liturgy)|Gospel reading]]. No readings from the [[Book of Revelation]], however, are included in the standard [[lectionary]] of the [[Orthodox church|Eastern Orthodox churches]].

Central to the [[Christian liturgy]] is the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] or "Holy Communion". The [[Words of Institution]] that begin this rite are drawn directly from 1 Corinthians 11:23–26. In addition, the communal recitation of the [[Lord's Prayer]] (in the form found in the Gospel of Matthew 6:9–13) is also a standard feature of [[Christian worship]].

[[Biblical paraphrase]]s and poetic renditions of stories from the life of Christ (e.g., the [[Heliand]]) became popular in the [[Middle Ages]], as did the portrayal of the [[Arrest of Jesus|arrest]], [[Trial of Jesus|trial]] and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|execution]] of Jesus in [[Passion play]]s.

[[Image:Andrea palladio fourth book image.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A villa with a superimposed portico, from Book IV of Palladio's ''[[I quattro libri dell'architettura]]'', in an English translation published in London, 1736.]]
[[File:PalladioRotondaPlan.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Plan for Palladio's [[Villa Rotonda]]. Features of the house were to become incorporated in numerous Palladian style houses throughout Europe over the following centuries.]]

'''Palladian architecture''' is  a European style of [[architecture]] derived from and inspired by the designs of the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] architect [[Andrea Palladio]] (1508–1580). That which is recognised as Palladian architecture today is an evolution of Palladio's original concepts. Palladio's work was strongly based on the symmetry, perspective and values of the formal classical temple architecture of the [[Ancient Greek]]s and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. From the 17th century Palladio's interpretation of this classical architecture was adapted as the style known as Palladianism. It continued to develop until the end of the 18th century.

Palladianism became popular briefly in [[Early Modern Britain|Britain]] during the mid-17th century, but its flowering was cut short by the onset of the [[English Civil War]] and the imposition of austerity which followed. In the early 18th century it returned to fashion, not only in England but also, directly influenced from Britain, in [[Prussia]]. Count [[Francesco Algarotti]] may have written to Burlington from Berlin that he was recommending to [[Frederick the Great]] the adoption in Prussia of the architectural style Burlington had introduced in England&lt;ref&gt;James Lees-Milne, ''The Earls of Creation'' 1962:120.&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff|Knobelsdorff]]'s opera house on the Unter den Linden, based on Campbell's [[Wanstead House]], had been constructed from 1741. Later in the century, when the style was falling from favour in Europe, it had a surge in popularity throughout the British colonies in North America, highlighted by examples such as [[Drayton Hall]] in South Carolina, the [[Redwood Library]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], the Morris-Jumel Mansion in [[New York City]], the [[Hammond-Harwood House]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Monticello]] and [[Poplar Forest]] in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], [http://www.palladiancenter.org/timeline-Palladianism.html "Palladio and English-American Palladianism."]&lt;/ref&gt;

The style continued to be popular in Europe throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, where it was frequently employed in the design of public and municipal buildings. From the latter half of the 19th century it was rivalled by the [[Gothic revival]] in the English-speaking world, whose champions, such as [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Augustus Pugin]], remembering the origins of Palladianism in ancient temples, deemed it too pagan for [[Anglican]] and [[Anglo-Catholic]] worship.&lt;ref&gt;Frampton, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; However, as an architectural style it has continued to be popular and to evolve; its [[pediment]]s, symmetry and proportions are clearly evident in the design of many modern buildings today.

== Palladio's architecture==
[[Image:Palladio Villa Godi.jpg|thumb|left|250px|"True Palladianism" in [[Villa Godi]] by Palladio from the ''[[Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]''. The extending wings are agricultural buildings and are not part of the villa. In the 18th century they became an important part of Palladianism—see photograph of [[Woburn Abbey]] below.]]
Buildings entirely designed by [[Palladio]] are all in [[Venice]] and the [[Veneto]], with an especially rich grouping of palazzi in [[Vicenza]]. They include [[Palladian Villas of the Veneto|villas]], and [[church architecture|churches]] such as [[Il Redentore|Redentore]] in Venice. In Palladio's architectural [[treatise]]s he followed the principles defined by the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] architect [[Vitruvius]] and his 15th-century disciple [[Leon Battista Alberti]], who adhered to principles of [[Roman architecture|classical Roman architecture]] based on mathematical proportions rather than the rich ornamental style also characteristic of the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;Copplestone, p.250&lt;/ref&gt;

Palladio always designed his [[villa]]s with reference to their setting. If on a hill, such as Villa Capra, [[facade]]s were frequently designed to be of equal value so that occupants could have fine views in all directions. Also, in such cases, [[portico]]s were built on all sides so that occupants could fully appreciate the countryside while being protected from the sun, similar to many [[United States|American]]-style [[porch]]es of today. Palladio sometimes used a [[loggia]] as an alternative to the portico. This can most simply be described as a recessed portico, or an internal single storey room, with pierced walls that are open to the elements.  Occasionally a loggia would be placed at second floor level over the top of a loggia below, creating what was known as a double loggia. Loggias were sometimes given significance in a facade by being surmounted by a pediment. Villa Godi has as its focal point a loggia rather than a portico, plus loggias terminating each end of the main building.&lt;ref name="Copplestone, p.251"&gt;Copplestone, p.251&lt;/ref&gt;

Palladio would often model his villa elevations on [[Roman temple]] facades. The temple influence, often in a [[cruciform]] design, later became a [[trademark]] of his work. Palladian villas are usually built with three floors: a rusticated [[basement]] or ground floor, containing the service and minor rooms. Above this, the [[piano nobile]] accessed through a portico reached by a flight of external steps, containing the principal reception and bedrooms, and above it is a low [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]] floor with secondary bedrooms and accommodation. The proportions of each room within the villa were calculated on simple mathematical ratios like 3:4 and 4:5, and the different rooms within the house were interrelated by these ratios. Earlier architects had used these formulas for balancing a single symmetrical facade; however, Palladio's designs related to the whole, usually square, villa.&lt;ref name="Copplestone, p.251"/&gt;

Palladio deeply considered the dual purpose of his villas as both farmhouses and palatial weekend retreats for wealthy [[merchant]] owners. These symmetrical temple-like houses often have equally symmetrical, but low, wings sweeping away from them to accommodate horses, farm animals, and agricultural stores. The wings, sometimes detached and connected to the villa by [[colonnade]]s, were designed not only to be functional but also to complement and accentuate the villa. They were, however, in no way intended to be part of the main house, and it is the design and use of these wings that Palladio's followers in the 18th century adapted to become an integral part of the building.&lt;ref&gt;Copplestone, pp.251–252&lt;/ref&gt;

Palladio's Four Books of Architecture was first published in 1570, This architectural treaty contains descriptions and illustrations of his own architecture along with the Roman building that inspired him to create the style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/s/style-guide-palladianism/|title=Style Guide: Palladianism|last=webmaster@vam.ac.uk|first=Victoria and Albert Museum, Digital Media|website=www.vam.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palladio reinterpreted Rome's ancient architecture and applied it to all kinds of buildings from grand villas and public buildings to humble houses and farm sheds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34143566|title=Palladio: The architect who inspired our love of columns|last=Kerley|first=Paul|date=2015-09-10|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Venetian window ==
[[File:Claydon House - geograph.org.uk - 1285177.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Claydon House]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] (begun 1757); here the [[Venetian window]] in the central bay is surrounded by a unifying blind arch. This house was intended to be one of two flanking wings to a vast Palladian house; the scheme was never completed.]]
{{main|Venetian window}} 
The Palladian, Serlian, or Venetian window features largely in Palladio's work and is almost a trademark of his early career. It consists of a central light with semicircular arch over, carried on an [[Impost (architecture)|impost]] consisting of a small [[entablature]], under which, and enclosing two other lights, one on each side, are [[pilasters]]. In the library at Venice, [[Jacopo Sansovino|Sansovino]] varied the design by substituting columns for the two inner pilasters. To describe its origin as being either Palladian or Venetian is not accurate; the motif was first used by [[Donato Bramante]]&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, Jaaes S. (1994). ''Palladio'' (series "Architect and Society")&lt;/ref&gt; and later mentioned by [[Sebastiano Serlio]] (1475–1554) in his seven-volume architectural book ''[[Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva]]'' expounding the ideals of Vitruvius and Roman architecture, this arched window is flanked by two lower rectangular openings, a motif that first appeared in the [[triumphal arch]]es of ancient Rome. Palladio used the motif extensively, most notably in the arcades of the [[Basilica Palladiana]] in [[Vicenza]]. It is also a feature of his entrances to both [[Villa Godi]] and [[Villa Forni Cerato]]. It is perhaps this extensive use of the motif in the [[Veneto]] that has given the window its alternative name of the Venetian window; it is also known as a Serlian window. Whatever the name or the origin, this form of window has probably become one of the most enduring features of Palladio's work seen in the later architectural styles evolved from Palladianism.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Palladio, Caroline Constant. ''The Palladio Guide''. [[Princeton Architectural Press]], 1993. p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[James Lees-Milne]], its first appearance in Britain was in the remodelled wings of [[Burlington House]], London, where the immediate source was actually in [[Inigo Jones]]'s designs for [[Whitehall Palace]] rather than drawn from Palladio himself.&lt;ref&gt;"The earliest example of the revived Venetian window in England", Lees-Milne, ''The Earls of Creation'', 1962:100.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant, in which the motif is enclosed within a relieving blind arch that unifies the motif, is not Palladian, though Burlington seems to have assumed it was so, in using a drawing in his possession showing three such features in a plain wall (see illustration of Claydon House above right). Modern scholarship attributes the drawing to [[Vincenzo Scamozzi|Scamozzi]]. Burlington employed the motif in 1721 for an elevation of [[Tottenham House|Tottenham Park]] in [[Savernake Forest]] for his brother-in-law Lord Bruce (since remodelled). Kent picked it up in his designs for the Houses of Parliament, and it appears in Kent's executed designs for the north front of [[Holkham Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;James Lees-Milne 1962:133f.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Palladianism ==
[[Image:Queens House.jpg|300px|thumb|left|[[Inigo Jones]] was the designer of the [[Queen's House]], Greenwich, begun in 1616, the first English Palladian house.]]

In 1570 Palladio published his book, ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura]]'', which inspired architects across Europe.

During the 17th century, many architects studying in Italy learned of Palladio's work. Foreign architects then returned home and adapted Palladio's style to suit various [[climate]]s, [[topography|topographies]] and personal tastes of their clients. Isolated forms of Palladianism throughout the world were brought about in this way. However, the Palladian style did not reach the zenith of its popularity until the 18th century, primarily in [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], [[Ireland]] and later [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;Copplestone, p.252&lt;/ref&gt; In Venice itself there was an early reaction to the excesses of [[Baroque architecture]] that manifested itself as a return to Palladian principles. The earliest neo-Palladians there were the exact contemporaries, both trained up as masons, [[Domenico Rossi (architect)|Domenico Rossi]] (1657–1737)&lt;ref&gt;Rossi built the new façade for the rebuilt [[San Stae|Sant'Eustachio]], known in Venice as San Stae, 1709, which was among the most sober in a competition that was commemorated with engravings of the submitted designs, and he rebuilt [[Ca' Corner della Regina, Venice|Ca' Corner della Regina]], 1724–27 (Deborah Howard and Sarah Quill, ''The Architectural history of Venice'', 2002: 238f).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Andrea Tirali]] (1657–1737).&lt;ref&gt;His façade of [[San Vidal, Venice|San Vidal]] is a faithful restatement of Palladio's [[San Francesco della Vigna]] and his masterwork is [[San Niccolò Tolentino, Venice|San Niccolò Tolentino]], 1706–14 (Howard and Quill 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tommaso Temanza]], their biographer, proved to be the movement's most able and learned proponent; in his hands the visual inheritance of Palladio's example became increasingly codified in correct rules and drifted towards [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Tavernor, ''Palladio and Palladianism'' Thames &amp; Hudson, 1991:112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most influential follower of Palladio anywhere, however, was the Englishman [[Inigo Jones]], who travelled throughout Italy with the 'Collector' Earl of Arundel, annotating his copy of Palladio's treatise, in 1613–14.&lt;ref&gt;Hanno-Walter Kruft. ''A History of Architectural Theory: From Vitruvius to the Present''. Princeton Architectural Press, 1994 and Edward Chaney, Inigo Jones's 'Roman Sketchbook, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; The "Palladianism" of Jones and his contemporaries and later followers was a style largely of facades, and the mathematical formulae dictating layout were not strictly applied. A handful of great country houses in England built between 1640 and c. 1680, such as [[Wilton House]], are in this Palladian style. These follow the great success of Jones' Palladian designs for the [[Queen's House]] at [[Greenwich]] and the [[Banqueting House]] at [[Whitehall]], the uncompleted royal palace in [[London]] of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].&lt;ref&gt;Copplestone, p.280&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Palladian designs advocated by Inigo Jones were too closely associated with the court of Charles I to survive the turmoil of the civil war. Following the Stuart restoration Jones's Palladianism was eclipsed by the [[baroque]] designs of such architects as [[William Talman (architect)|William Talman]] and Sir [[John Vanbrugh]], [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], and even Jones' pupil [[John Webb (architect)|John Webb]].&lt;ref&gt;Copplestone, p.281&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[baroque]] style, popular in continental Europe, was never truly to the English taste and was considered excessively flamboyant, catholic and 'florid'. It was quickly superseded when, in the first quarter of the 18th century, four books were published in Britain which highlighted the simplicity and purity of classical architecture. These were:
#''[[Vitruvius Britannicus]]'' published by [[Colen Campbell]], 1715 (of which supplemental volumes appeared through the century)
#''Palladio's Four Books of Architecture'' translated by [[Giacomo Leoni]], published from 1715 onwards.
#[[Leone Battista Alberti]]'s ''[[De Re Aedificatoria]]'', translated by Giacomo Leoni, published 1726.
#''The Designs of Inigo Jones... with Some Additional Designs'', published by [[William Kent]], 2 vols., 1727 (A further volume, ''Some Designs of Mr. Inigo Jones and Mr. William Kent'' was published in 1744 by the architect [[John Vardy]], an associate of Kent.)

The most popular of these among the wealthy patrons of the day was the four-volume ''Vitruvius Britannicus'' by Colen Campbell. Campbell was both an architect and a publisher. The book was basically a book of design containing architectural prints of British buildings, which had been inspired by the great architects from [[Vitruvius]] to Palladio; at first mainly those of Inigo Jones, but the later tomes contained drawings and plans by Campbell and other 18th-century architects. These four books greatly contributed to Palladian architecture becoming established in 18th-century Britain. Their three authors became the most fashionable and sought after architects of the era. Due to his book ''Vitruvius Britannicus'', [[Colen Campbell]] was chosen as the architect for banker [[Henry Hoare (banker)|Henry Hoare I]]'s [[Stourhead]] house (''illustration above''), a masterpiece that became the inspiration for dozens of similar houses across England.

Palladio's central temple is no longer free standing, the wings are now elevated to near equal importance, and the cattle sheds terminating Palladio's design are now clearly part of the façade.]]

At the forefront of the new school of design was the aristocratic "architect earl", [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington]]; in 1729, he and William Kent, designed [[Chiswick House]]. This House was a reinterpretation of Palladio's Villa Capra, but purified of 16th century elements and ornament. This severe lack of ornamentation was to be a feature of the Palladianism.
In 1734 [[William Kent]] and Lord Burlington designed one of England's finest examples of Palladian architecture with [[Holkham Hall]] in [[Norfolk]]. The main block of this house followed Palladio's dictates quite closely, but Palladio's low, often detached, wings of farm buildings were elevated in significance. Kent attached them to the design, banished the farm animals, and elevated the wings to almost the same importance as the house itself. These wings were often adorned with porticos and pediments, often resembling, as at the much later  [[Kedleston Hall]], small [[country houses]] in their own right. It was the development of the flanking wings that was to cause English Palladianism to evolve from being a pastiche of Palladio's original work.

Architectural styles evolve and change to suit the requirements of each individual client. When in 1746 the [[John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford|Duke of Bedford]] decided to rebuild [[Woburn Abbey]], he chose the Palladian style for the design, as this was now the most fashionable of the era. He selected architect [[Henry Flitcroft]], a protege of Burlington. Flitcroft's designs, while Palladian in nature, would not be recognised by Palladio himself. The central block is small, only three bays, the temple-like portico is merely suggested, and it is closed. Two great flanking wings containing a vast suite of [[state room]]s replace the walls or colonnades which should have connected to the farm buildings; the farm buildings terminating the structure are elevated in height to match the central block, and given [[Palladian window]]s, to ensure they are seen as of Palladian design. This development of the style was to be repeated in countless houses, and town halls in Britain over one hundred years. Falling from favour during the Victorian era, it was revived by Sir [[Aston Webb]] for his refacing of [[Buckingham Palace]] in 1913. Often the terminating blocks would have blind porticos and pilasters themselves, competing for attention with, or complementing the central block. This was all very far removed from the designs of Palladio two hundred years earlier.

English Palladian houses were now no longer the small but exquisite weekend retreats from which their Italian counterparts were conceived. They were no longer [[villa]]s but "power houses" in Sir [[John Summerson]]'s term, the symbolic centres of power of the Whig "squirearchy" that ruled Britain. As the Palladian style swept Britain, all thoughts of mathematical proportion were swept away. Rather than square houses with supporting wings, these buildings had the length of the façade as their major consideration; long houses often only one room deep were deliberately deceitful in giving a false impression of size.

=== Irish Palladianism ===
[[File:Russborough-House Part-of-the-facade.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Russborough]], Co. Wicklow: a notable example of Irish Palladianism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iarc.ie/exhibitions/previous-exhibitions/andrea-palladio-1508-1580/|title=Andrea Palladio 1508–1580|publisher=Irish Architectural Archive|date=2010|access-date=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During the Palladian revival period in [[Ireland]], even quite modest mansions were cast in a neo-Palladian mould. Palladian architecture in Ireland subtly differs from that in England. While adhering as in other countries to the basic ideals of Palladio, it is often truer to them – perhaps because it was often designed by architects who had come directly from mainland Europe, and therefore were not influenced by the evolution that Palladianism was undergoing in Britain. Whatever the reason, Palladianism still had to be adapted for the wetter, colder weather.

One of the most pioneering Irish architects was Sir [[Edward Lovett Pearce]] (1699–1733), who became one of the leading advocates of Palladianism in Ireland. A cousin of Sir [[John Vanbrugh]], he was originally one of his pupils, but rejecting the baroque, he spent three years studying architecture in [[France]] and Italy, before returning home to Ireland. His most important Palladian work is the former [[Irish Houses of Parliament]] in Dublin. He was a prolific architect who also designed the south façade of [[Drumcondra House]] in 1725 and [[Summerhill House]] in 1731, which was completed after Pearce's death by [[Richard Cassels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sir Edward Lovett Pearce 1699–1733: the Palladian architect and his buildings|first=Pat|last=Sheridan|journal=Dublin Historical Record|volume=67|issue=2|year=2014|pages=19–25|jstor=24615990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pearce oversaw the building of [[Castletown House]], near [[Dublin]], designed by the Italian architect [[Alessandro Galilei]] (1691–1737). It is perhaps the only Palladian house in Ireland to have been built with Palladio's mathematical ratios, and one of the three Irish mansions which claim to have inspired the design of the [[White House]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].

Other examples include [[Russborough]], designed by Cassels, who also designed the Palladian Rotunda Hospital in Dublin, and [[Florence Court]], [[County Fermanagh]]. Irish Palladian [[Country houses]] often feature robust [[Rococo]] plasterwork, frequently executed by the [[Lafranchini brothers]], an Irish speciality, which is far more flamboyant than the interiors of their contemporaries in England. So much of Dublin was built in the 18th century that it set a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] stamp on the city; however arising out of bad planning and poverty, until recently Dublin was one of the few cities where fine 18th-century housing could be seen in ruinous condition. Elsewhere in Ireland after 1922, the lead was removed from the roofs of unoccupied Palladian houses for its value as scrap, with the houses often abandoned owing to excessive roof-rate based taxes. Some roofless Palladian houses can still be found in the depopulated Irish countryside.

=== North American Palladianism ===
Palladio's influence in North America&lt;ref&gt;A brief survey is Robert Tavernor, "Anglo-Palladianism and the birth of a new nation" in ''Palladio and Palladianism'', 1991:181–209; Walter M. Whitehill, '' ''Palladio in America'', 1978 is still the standard work.&lt;/ref&gt; is evident almost from the beginning of architect-designed building there though the Anglo-Irish philosopher, [[George Berkeley]], may have been America's pioneering Palladian. Acquiring a large farmhouse in Middletown, near Newport in the late 1720s, Berkeley dubbed it "Whitehall" and improved it with a Palladian doorcase derived from William Kent's ''Designs of Inigo Jones'' (1727), which he may have brought with him from London;&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Gaustad, ''George Berkeley in America'' (Yale University Press, 1979): "Berkeley's one architectural achievement in the New World" (p. 70).&lt;/ref&gt; Palladio's work was included in the library of a thousand volumes he amassed for the purpose and sent to [[Yale College]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaustad, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1749 [[Peter Harrison (architect)|Peter Harrison]] adopted the design of his [[Redwood Library and Athenaeum|Redwood Library]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], more directly from Palladio's ''[[I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura|Quattro Libri]]'', while his Brick Market, also in Newport, of a decade later is also Palladian in conception.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], [http://www.palladiancenter.org/patternbooks.html "Building America."]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hammond-Harwood House]] in [[Annapolis, Maryland]] (''illustration'') is an example of Palladian architecture in the United States. It is the only existing work of colonial academic architecture that was principally designed from a plate in [[Andrea Palladio]]’s ''Quattro Libri''. The house was designed by the architect [[William Buckland (architect)|William Buckland]] in 1773–74 for wealthy farmer Matthias Hammond of [[Anne Arundel County]], [[Maryland]]. It was modeled on the design of the [[Villa Pisani (Montagnana)|Villa Pisani]] in [[Montagnana]], [[Italy]] in Book II, Chapter XIV of ''I Quattro Libri dell’Achitettura.''

The politician and architect [[Thomas Jefferson]] (1743–1826) once referred to Palladio's '' Quattro Libri'' as his [[bible]]. Jefferson acquired an intense appreciation of Palladio's architectural concepts, and his designs for his own beloved [[Monticello]],&lt;ref&gt;Fiske Kimball, ''Thomas Jefferson, Architect'', 1916.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[James Barbour]] [[Barboursville (James Barbour)|Barboursville]] estate, [[Virginia State Capitol]], and the [[University of Virginia]] were based on drawings from Palladio's book.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Nichols, ''Thomas Jefferson's Architectural Drawings'', 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing the powerful political significance pertaining to ancient Roman buildings, Jefferson designed his civic buildings in the Palladian style. Monticello (remodelled between 1796 and 1808) is quite clearly based on Palladio's [[Villa Capra]], however, with modifications, in a style which is described in America today as [[Colonial Georgian]]. Jefferson's [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], or [[The Rotunda (University of Virginia)|Rotunda]], at the University of Virginia is undeniably Palladian in concept and style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Palladio's Architecture and Its Influence: A Photographic Guide|year=1980|page=107|author=Joseph C. Farber, [[Henry Hope Reed Jr.|Henry Hope Reed]]|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-23922-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hammond-Harwood House (Md. Ave. Facade).jpg|thumb|left|350px|The [[Hammond-Harwood House]] was modeled after the [[Villa Pisani (Montagnana)|Villa Pisani]] at Montagnana from ''The Four Books of Architecture by Andrea Palladio'']]

In [[Virginia]] and [[The Carolinas|Carolina]], the Palladian manner is epitomised in numerous [[Tidewater region of Virginia|Tidewater]] [[Plantation complexes in the Southeastern United States#Plantation house|plantation house]]s, such as [[Stratford Hall Plantation|Stratford Hall]] or [[Westover Plantation]], or [[Drayton Hall]] near [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. These examples are all classic American [[American colonial architecture|colonial]] examples of a Palladian taste that was transmitted through [[engraving]]s, for the benefit of masons—and patrons, too—who had no first-hand experience of European building practice. A feature of American Palladianism was the re-emergence of the great portico, which again, as in Italy, fulfilled the need of protection from the sun; the portico in various forms and size became a dominant feature of American [[colonial architecture]]. In the north European countries the portico had become a mere symbol, often closed, or merely hinted at in the design by [[pilaster]]s, and sometimes in very late examples of English Palladianism adapted to become a [[porte-cochere]]; in America, the Palladian portico regained its full glory.

One house which clearly shows this Palladian-Gibbs influence is [[Mount Airy, Richmond County, Virginia|Mount Airy]], in [[Richmond County, Virginia]], built in 1758–62.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Leland M., ''A Concise History of American Architecture'', Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, NY, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Westover Plantation|Westover]] the north and south entrances, made of imported [[Portland stone]], were patterned after a plate in William Salmon's ''Palladio Londinensis'' (1734).&lt;ref&gt;Severens, Kenneth, ''Southern Architecture: 350 Years of Distinctive American Buildings'', E.P. Dutton,  NY 1981 p 37; specifically, both doors seem to have been derived from plates XXV and XXVI of ''Palladio Londinensis'', a builders guide first published in London in 1734, the very year when the doorways may have been installed. (Morrison, High, ''American's First Architecture: From the First Colonial Settlements to the National Period.'' Oxford University Press, NY  1952  p. 340).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Province House (Nova Scotia).jpg|300px|thumb|[[Province House (Nova Scotia)|Nova Scotia Legislature Building]], sandstone, 1819.]]

The distinctive feature of [[Drayton Hall]], its two-storey portico, was derived directly from Palladio.&lt;ref&gt;Severens, Kenneth, ''Southern Architecture: 350 Years of Distinctive American Buildings'', E.P. Dutton,  NY 1981 p 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The neoclassical presidential mansion, the [[White House]] in Washington, was inspired by Irish Palladianism. Both Castle Coole and Richard Cassel's [[Leinster House]] in Dublin claim to have inspired the architect [[James Hoban]], who designed the executive mansion, built between 1792 and 1800. Hoban, born in [[Callan, County Kilkenny|Callan]], [[County Kilkenny]], in 1762, studied architecture in Dublin, where Leinster House (built c. 1747) was one of the finest buildings at the time. The White House is more neoclassical than Palladian; particularly the South façade, which closely resembles [[James Wyatt]]'s 1790 design for [[Castle Coole]], also in Ireland. Castle Coole is, in the words of the architectural commentator Gervase Jackson-Stops, "A culmination of the Palladian traditions, yet strictly neoclassical in its chaste ornament and noble austerity."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson-Stops p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the adaptations made to Palladianism in America was that the piano nobile now tended to be placed on the ground floor, rather than above a service floor, as was the tradition in Europe. This service floor, if it existed at all, was now a discreet semi-basement. This negated the need for an ornate external staircase leading to the main entrance as in the more original Palladian designs. This would also be a feature of the neoclassical style that followed Palladianism.

The only two houses in the United States—from the English colonial period (1607–1776)—that can be definitively attributed to designs from the ''Four Books of Architecture'' are architect William Buckland's [[Hammond-Harwood House]] (1774) in [[Annapolis, Maryland]], and Thomas Jefferson's first Monticello. The design source for the Hammond-Harwood House is Villa Pisani at [[Montagnana]] (Book II, Chapter XIV), and for the first Monticello (1770) the design source is [[Villa Cornaro]] at [[Piombino Dese]] (Book II, Chapter XIV). Thomas Jefferson later covered this façade with additions so that the Hammond-Harwood House remains the only pure and pristine example of direct modeling in America today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hammondharwoodhouse.org/index.php?id=33|title=The Palladian Connection|publisher=Hammond-Harwood House Association|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its later development, Palladian architecture in Canada is rare. One notable example is the [[Province House (Nova Scotia)|Nova Scotia Legislature building]], completed in 1819.  Another example is [[Government House (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Government House]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland]].
 
[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], a non-profit membership organization, was founded in 1979 to research and promote understanding of Palladio’s influence in the United States.

== Legacy ==
 
By the 1770s, in Britain, such architects as [[Robert Adam]] and Sir [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] were in huge popular demand, but they were now drawing on a great variety of classical sources, including ancient [[Greece]], so much so that their forms of architecture were eventually defined as [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] rather than Palladian. In Europe, the Palladian revival ended by the end of the 18th century. In North America, Palladianism lingered a little longer; Thomas Jefferson's floor plans and elevations owe a great deal to Palladio's ''Quattro Libri.'' The term "Palladian" today is often misused, and tends to describe a building with any classical pretensions. There was, however, a revival of Palladian ideas amongst the colonial revivalists of the early 20th century, and the strain has been unbroken, even through the modernist period.

In the mid-20th century, the originality of the approach of the architectural historian [[Colin Rowe]] had the effect of re-situating the assessment of modern architecture within history and acknowledged the Palladian architecture as an active influence. In the later 20th century, when Rowe's influence had spread worldwide, this approach had become a key element in the process of architectural and urban design. If "the presence of the past" was evident in the work of many architects in the late 20th century, from [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] to [[Aldo Rossi]], [[Robert Venturi]], [[Oswald Matthias Ungers]], [[Peter Eisenman]], [[Michael Graves]] and others, this was largely due to the influence of Rowe. Colin Rowe's unorthodox and non-chronological view of history then made it possible for him to develop theoretical formulations such as his famous essay "The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa" (1947) in which he theorised that there were compositional "rules" in Palladio’s villas that could be demonstrated to correspond to similar "rules" in Le Corbusier’s villas at Poissy and Garches.&lt;ref name="Other Essays 1976"&gt;''The Mathematics of the Ideal Villa and Other Essays'', MIT Press, Main essay reprinted in collected works volume, (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; This approach enabled Rowe to elaborate an astonishingly fresh and provocative trans-historical assessment of both Palladio and Le Corbusier, in which the architecture of both was assessed not in chronological time, but side by side in the present moment.&lt;ref name="Other Essays 1976"/&gt;

'''Pharmacometabolomics''', also known as '''pharmacometabonomics''', is a field which stems from [[metabolomics]], the quantification and analysis of [[metabolites]] produced by the body.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2014/&gt; It refers to the direct measurement of [[metabolites]] in an individual’s bodily fluids, in order to predict or evaluate the [[metabolism]] of [[pharmaceutical]] compounds, and to better understand the pharmacokinetic profile of a drug.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2014/&gt; Alternatively, pharmacometabolomics can be applied to measure [[metabolite]] levels following the administration of a [[pharmaceutical]] compound, in order to monitor the effects of the compound on certain metabolic pathways(pharmacodynamics). This provides detailed mapping of drug effects on metabolism and the pathways that are implicated in mechanism of variation of response to treatment.&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper2-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=trupp-statins2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=yerges-armstrong-aspirin2013/&gt; In addition, the metabolic profile of an individual at baseline (metabotype) provides information about how individuals respond to treatment and highlights heterogeneity within a disease state.&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper3-2011 /&gt; All three approaches require the quantification of [[metabolites]] found in [[bodily fluids]] and [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], such as blood or urine, and can be used in the assessment of [[pharmaceutical]] treatment options for numerous [[disease]] states.

==Goals of Pharmacometabolomics==
Pharmacometabolomics is thought to provide information that complements that gained from other [[omics]], namely [[genomics]], [[transcriptomics]], and [[proteomics]].  Looking at the characteristics of an individual down through these different levels of detail, there is an increasingly more accurate prediction of a person’s ability to respond to a [[pharmaceutical]] compound. The [[genome]], made up of 25 000 [[genes]], can indicate possible errors in drug [[metabolism]]; the [[transcriptome]], made up of 85,000 transcripts, can provide information about which genes important in [[metabolism]] are being actively transcribed; and the [[proteome]], &gt;10,000,000 members, depicts which [[proteins]] are active in the body to carry out these functions. Pharmacometabolomics complements the [[omics]] with direct measurement of the products of all of these reactions, but with perhaps a relatively smaller number of members: that was initially projected to be approximately 2200 [[metabolites]],&lt;ref name =Weiss-2012 /&gt; but could be a larger number when gut derived metabolites and xenobiotics are added to the list. Overall, the goal of pharmacometabolomics is to more closely predict or assess the response of an individual to a [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] compound, permitting continued treatment with the right drug or dosage depending on the variations in their [[metabolism]] and ability to respond to treatment.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008 /&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=baraldi-2009 /&gt;

Pharmacometabolomic analyses, through the use of a [[metabolomics]] approach, can provide a comprehensive and detailed metabolic profile or “[[metabolome|metabolic fingerprint]]” for an individual patient. Such [[metabolome|metabolic profiles]] can provide a complete overview of individual [[metabolite]] or pathway alterations, providing a more realistic depiction of [[disease]] [[phenotypes]]. This approach can then be applied to the prediction of response to a [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] compound by patients with a particular metabolic profile.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=baraldi-2009/&gt;  Pharmacometabolomic analyses of drug response are often coupled or followed up with [[pharmacogenetics]] studies. [[Pharmacogenetics]] focuses on the identification of [[genetic variations]] (e.g. [[single-nucleotide polymorphisms]]) within patients that may contribute to altered drug responses and overall outcome of a certain treatment. The results of pharmacometabolomics analyses can act to “inform” or “direct” [[pharmacogenetic]] analyses by correlating aberrant [[metabolite]] concentrations or metabolic pathways to potential alterations at the [[genetics|genetic]] level.&lt;ref name=abo-2012 /&gt; This concept has been established with two seminal publications from studies of antidepressants  serotonin reuptake inhibitors &lt;ref name=abo-2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ji-2011 /&gt; where metabolic signatures were able to define pathway implicated in response to the antidepressant and that lead to identification of genetic variants within a key gene within highlighted pathway as being implicated in variation in response. These genetic variants were not identified through genetic analysis alone and hence illustrated how metabolomics can guide and inform genetic data.

==History==
Although the applications of pharmacometabolomics to [[personalized medicine]] are largely only being realized now, the study of an individual’s [[metabolism]] has been used to treat disease since the Middle Ages. Early physicians employed a primitive form of metabolomic analysis by smelling, tasting and looking at urine to diagnose disease. Obviously the measurement techniques needed to look at specific [[metabolites]] were unavailable at that time, but such technologies have evolved dramatically over the last decade to develop precise, [[high-throughput screening|high-throughput]] devices, as well as the accompanying data analysis software to analyze output. Currently, sample purification processes, such as [[high-performance liquid chromatography|liquid]] or [[gas chromatography]], are coupled with either [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]]-based or [[nuclear magnetic resonance|nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)]]-based analytical methods to characterize the [[metabolite]] profiles of individual patients.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt; Continually advancing [[bioinformatics|informatics]] tools allow for the identification, quantification and classification of [[metabolites]] to determine which [[metabolic pathway|pathways]] may influence certain [[pharmaceutical]] interventions.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt; One of the earliest studies discussing the principle and applications of pharmacometabolomics was conducted in an [[animal model]] to look at the [[metabolism]] of [[paracetamol]] and liver damage. [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR spectroscopy]] was used to analyze the urinary metabolic profiles of rats pre- and post-treatment with [[paracetamol]]. The analysis revealed a certain metabolic profile associated with increased liver damage following [[paracetamol]] treatment.&lt;ref name=clayton-2006/&gt;  At this point, it was eagerly anticipated that such pharmacometabolomics approaches could be applied to [[personalized medicine|personalized]] human [[medicine]]. Since this [[publication]] in 2006, the Pharmacometabolomics Research Network led by Duke University researchers and that included partnerships between centers of excellence in metabolomics, pharmacogenomics and informatics (over sixteen academic centers funded by NIGMS) has been able to illustrate for the first time the power of the pharmacometabolomics approach in informing about treatment outcomes in large clinical studies and with use of drugs that include antidepressants, statins, antihypertensives, antiplatelet therapies and antipsychotics.&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper2-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=trupp-statins2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=yerges-armstrong-aspirin2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper3-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=fan-depressionpaper1-2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper4-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=zhu-depressionpaper5-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=krauss-statins2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=wikoff-atenolol2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=lewis-aspirinreview2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-schiz2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=yao-cnspaper1-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=perroud-cnspaper2-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=yao-cnspaper4-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=patkar-cnspaper5-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=mannelli-cnspaper6-2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=steffens-cnspaper7-2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=yao-cnspaper8-2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=condray-cnspaper9-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-cnspaper10-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=han-cnspaper11-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-cnspaper12-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-cnspaper13-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-cnspaper14-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Motsinger-cnspaper15-2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=McEvoy-cnspaper16-2013/&gt; Totally new concepts emerged from these studies on use of pharmacometabolomics as a tool that can bring a paradigm shift in the field of pharmacology. It illustrated how pharmacometabolomics can enable a Quantitative and Systems Pharmacology approach.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2014/&gt; 
Pharmacometabolomics has been applied for the treatment of numerous human diseases, such as [[schizophrenia]], [[diabetes]], [[neural disease]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;

== Personalized Medicine==
As [[metabolite]] analyses are being conducted at the individual patient level, pharmacometabolomics may be considered a form of [[personalized medicine]]. This field is currently being employed in a predictive manner to determine the potential responses of therapeutic compounds in individual patients, allowing for more customized treatment regimens. It is anticipated that such pharmacometabolomics approaches will lead to the improved ability to predict an individual’s response to a compound, the efficacy and metabolism of it as well as adverse or off-target effects that may take place in the body. The metabolism of certain drugs varies from patient to patient as the [[copy number variations|copy number]] of the [[genes]] which code for common [[Cytochrome P450|drug metabolizing]] [[enzymes]] varies within the population, and leads to differences in the ability of an individual to metabolize different compounds.&lt;ref name=motulsky-1957/&gt; Other important personal factors contributing to an individual’s metabolic profile, such as patient nutritional status, commensal [[bacteria]], age, and pre-existing medical conditions, are also reflected in [[metabolite]] assessment.,&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=clayton-2006/&gt; Overall, pharmacometabolomic analyses combined with such approaches as [[pharmacogenetics]], can function to identify the [[metabolic]] processes and particular [[gene]]tic alterations that may compromise the anticipated efficacy of a drug in a particular patient. The results of such analyses can then allow for the modification of treatment regimens to optimize treatment outcome.&lt;ref name=abo-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=ji-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=corona-2011/&gt;

==Current Applications==

===Predicting treatment outcome===

====Metabotype informs about treatment outcomes====
Pharmacometabolomics may be used in a predictive manner to determine the correct course of action in regards to a patient about to undergo some type of drug treatment. This involves determining the metabolic profile of a patient prior to treatment, and correlating metabolic signatures with the outcome of a [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical]] treatment course. Analysis of a patient’s metabolic profile can reveal factors that may contribute to altered drug [[metabolism]], allowing for predictions of the overall efficacy of a proposed treatment, as well as potential [[adverse drug reaction|drug toxicity]] risks that may differ from the general population.  This approach has been used to identify novel or previously characterized metabolic [[biomarkers]] in patients, which can be used to predict the expected outcome of that patient following treatment with a [[pharmaceutical drug|pharmaceutical compound]].&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=corona-2011/&gt; One example of the clinical application of pharmacometabolomics are studies that looked to identify a predictive metabolic marker for the treatment of [[major depressive disorder|major depressive disorder (MDD)]].,&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper2-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper3-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=abo-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=ji-2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=fan-depressionpaper1-2010/&gt; In a study with antidepressant Sertraline, the Pharmacometabolomics Network illustrated that metabolic profile at baseline of patients with major depression can inform about treatment outcomes.&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper3-2011/&gt; In addition the study illustrated the power of metabolomics for defining response to placebo and compared response to placebo to response to sertraline and showed that several pathways were common to both.&lt;ref name=daouk-depressionpaper3-2011/&gt; In another study with escitalopram citalopram, [[metabolomic]] analysis of [[blood plasma|plasma]] from patients with [[major depressive disorder|MDD]] revealed that variations in [[glycine]] metabolism were negatively associated with patient outcome upon treatment with [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor|selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)]], an important drug class involved in the treatment of this disease.&lt;ref name=abo-2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=ji-2011/&gt;

===Monitoring drug-related alterations in metabolic pathways===
The second major application of pharmacometabolomics is the analysis of a patient’s metabolic profile following the administration of a specific therapy. This process is often secondary to a pre-treatment metabolic analysis, allowing for the comparison of pre- and post-treatment [[metabolite]]  concentrations. This allows for the identification of the metabolic processes and pathways that are being altered by the treatment either intentionally as a designated [[drug design|target]] of the compound, or unintentionally as a [[adverse drug reaction|side effect]]. Furthermore, the concentration and variety of [[metabolites]] produced from the compound itself can also be identified, providing information on the rate of [[metabolism]] and potentially leading to development of a related compound with increased efficacy or decreased [[adverse drug reaction|side effects]]. An example of this approach was used to investigate the effect of several [[antipsychotic]] drugs on [[lipid metabolism]] in patients treated for [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=daouk-schiz2007/&gt; It was hypothesized that these [[antipsychotic]] drugs may be altering [[lipid metabolism]] in treated patients with [[schizophrenia]], contributing to the weight gain and [[hypertriglyceridemia]]. The study monitored [[lipid]] metabolites in patients both before and after treatment with [[antipsychotics]]. The compiled pre- and post-treatment profiles were then be compared to examine the effect of these compounds on [[lipid]] [[metabolism]]. The researchers found correlations between treatment with [[antipsychotic]] drugs and [[lipid]] [[metabolism]], in both a lipid-class-specific and drug-specific manner,&lt;ref name=daouk-schiz2007/&gt; establishing new foundations around the concept that pharmacometabolomics provides powerful tools for enabling detailed mapping of drug effects. Additional studies by the Pharmacometabolomics Research Network enabled mapping in ways not possible before effects of statins,&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=daouk-statins2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=trupp-statins2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=krauss-statins2013/&gt;  atenolol &lt;ref name=wikoff-atenolol2013/&gt; and aspirin.&lt;ref name=yerges-armstrong-aspirin2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=lewis-aspirinreview2013/&gt; Totally new insights were gained about effect of these drugs on metabolism and they highlighted pathways implicated in response and side effects.

==Metabolite Quantification and Analysis==
In order to identify and quantify metabolites produced by the body, various detection methods have been employed. Most often, these involve the use of [[nuclear magnetic resonance|nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy]] or [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]], providing universal detection, identification and quantification of metabolites in individual patient samples. Although both processes are used in pharmacometabolomic analyses, there are advantages and disadvantages for using either [[nuclear magnetic resonance|nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy]]- or [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]]-based platforms in this application.

===Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy===
{{Main|Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy}}
[[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]] has been utilized for the analysis of biological samples since the 1980s, and can be used as an effective technique for the identification and quantification of both known and unknown metabolites. For details on the principles of this technique, see [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]]. In pharmacometabolomics analyses, [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] is advantageous because minimal sample preparation is required. Isolated patient samples typically include blood or urine due to their minimally-invasive acquisition, however, other fluid types and solid tissue samples have also been studied with this approach.&lt;ref name=zhang2010/&gt; Due to the minimal preparation of samples before analysis, samples can be completely recovered following [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] analysis. This permits samples to be repeatedly processed with extremely high levels of reproducibility, as well as maintaining precious patient samples for alternative analysis. The high reproducibility and precision of [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]], coupled with relatively fast processing time (greater than 100 samples per day), makes this process a relatively high-throughput form of sample analysis. One disadvantage of this technique is the relatively poor metabolite detection sensitivity compared to MS-based analysis, leading to a requirement for greater initial sample volume.&lt;ref name=zhang2010/&gt; Furthermore, the initial instrument costs are extremely high, for both [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] and MS equipment.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;

===Mass Spectrometry===
{{Main|Mass Spectrometry}}
An alternative approach to the identification and quantification of patient samples is through the use of mass spectrometry. This approach offers excellent precision and sensitivity in the identification, characterization and quantification of metabolites in multiple patient sample types, such as blood and urine. The [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]] approach is typically coupled to [[gas chromatography|gas chromatography (GC)]], in [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|GC-MS]]  or [[Chromatography#Liquid chromatography|liquid chromatography (LC)]], in [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]], which aid in initially separating out the metabolite components within complex sample mixtures, and can allow for the isolation of particular metabolite subsets for analysis. [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|GC-MS]] can provide relatively precise quantification of metabolites, as well as chemical structural information that can be compared to pre-existing chemical libraries.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt; [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|GC-MS]] can be conducted in a relatively high-throughput manner (greater than 100 samples per day) with greater detection sensitivity than [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] analysis. A limitation of [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|GC-MS]] for this application, however, is that processed metabolite components must be readily volatized for sample processing.

[[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] initially separates out the components of a sample mixture based on properties such as hydrophobicity, before processing them for identification and quantification by [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]]. Overall, [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] is an extremely flexible method for processing most compound types in a somewhat high-throughput manner (20-100 samples a day), also with greater sensitivity than [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] analysis. For both [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|GC-MS]] and [[Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry|LC-MS]] there are limitations in the reproducibility of metabolite quantification.&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008 /&gt; Furthermore, sample processing for downstream [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]] analysis is much more intensive than in [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] application, and results in the destruction of the original sample (via [[trypsin]] digestion).&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;

Following identification and quantification of metabolites in individual patient samples, [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] and [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]] output is compiled into a dataset. These datasets include information on the identity and levels of individual metabolites detected within processed samples, as well as characteristics of each metabolite during the detection process (e.g. mass-to-charge ratios for [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]]-based analysis). Multiple datasets can be created and compiled into large databases for individual patients in order to monitor varying metabolic profiles over a treatment course (i.e. pre- and post-treatment profiles). Each database is then processed through a type of informatics platform with software designed to characterize and analyze the data to generate an overall metabolic profile for the patient. To generate this overall profile, computational programs are designed to:
* identify metabolic disease signatures&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;
* assess treatment class (pre- or post-treatment)&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;
* identify compounds present in a patient sample that may alter drug response, or be caused by a therapy&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;
* identify metabolite variables and interactions among these variables&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;
* map identified variables to known metabolic and biochemical pathways&lt;ref name=daouk-weinshilboum2008/&gt;

==Limitations==
Along with the emerging diagnostic capabilities of pharmacometabolomics, there are limitations introduced when individual variability is looked at. The ability to determine an individual’s physiological state by measurement of metabolites is not contested, but the extreme variability that can be introduced by age, nutrition, and [[commensalism|commensal organisms]] suggest problems in creating generalized pharmacometabolomes for patient groups.&lt;ref name=adamo2010/&gt; However, as long as meaningful metabolic signatures can be elucidated to create baseline values, there still exists a possible means of comparison.&lt;ref name=baraldi-2009/&gt;

Issues surrounding the measurement of metabolites in an individual can also arise from the methodology of metabolite detection, and there are arguments both for and against [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|NMR]] and [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometry (MS)]]. Other limitations surrounding metabolite analysis include the need for proper handling and processing of samples, as well as proper maintenance and calibration of the analytical and computational equipment. These tasks require skilled and experienced technicians, and potential instrument repair costs due to continuous sample processing can be costly. The cost of the processing and analytical platforms alone is very high, making it difficult for many facilities to afford pharmacometabolomics-based treatment analyses.

==Implications for Health Care==
{{Main|Personalized medicine}}
Pharmacometabolomics may decrease the burden on the healthcare system by better gauging the correct choice of treatment drug and dosage in order to optimize the response of a patient to a treatment. Hopefully, this approach will also ultimately limit the number of [[adverse drug reactions|adverse drug reactions (ADRs)]] associated with many treatment regimens.&lt;ref name=corona-2011/&gt; Overall, physicians would be better able to apply more personalized, and potentially more effective, treatments to their patients. It is important to consider, however, that the processing and analysis of the patient samples takes time, resulting in delayed treatment. 
Another concern about the application of pharmacometabolomics analyses to individual patient care, is deciding who should and who should not receive this in-depth, personalized treatment protocol. Certain diseases and stages of disease would have to be classified according to their requirement of such a treatment plan, but there are no criteria for this classification. Furthermore, not all hospitals and treatment institutes can afford the equipment to process and analyze patient samples on site, but sending out samples takes time and ultimately delays treatment. 
Health insurance coverage of such procedures may also be an issue. Certain insurance companies may discriminate against the application of this type of sample analysis and metabolite characterization. Furthermore, there would have to be regulations put in place to ensure that there was no discrimination by insurance companies against the metabolic profiles of individual patients (“high metabolizers” vs. risky “low metabolizers”).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5135">The '''Savory brittleness scale''' is used to describe the position on a simple 1 to 10 scale of any environment based upon the distribution of humidity throughout each year, to assist with management decisions. It was developed by [[Allan Savory]], a [[Zimbabwe]]an biologist, because scientists were only recognizing desertification taking place in low rainfall or “fragile” environments. Savory recognized that desertification was the extreme or terminal form of man-made [[land degradation]], but that this began with simple biodiversity loss that was occurring at all levels of rainfall from high to low. Fragile environments did not cover the situation because Savory thought all environments were fragile. The scale is used in land management because the annual distribution of humidity affects the way entire biological communities function on the land, and in particular to conservation or resting the environment to maintain or restore biodiversity. He also noted that the distribution of humidity and thus position on the brittleness scale influenced the effects of such things as fire and grazing by large herbivores.

==Scale==

The scale ranges from 1 to 10 with 1 being non-brittle and 10 being very brittle. The scale is subjective; there is no formula for its calculation. A [[tropical rainforest]] is considered a 1 on the scale, and an arid [[desert]] such as the [[Namib]] or [[Gobi]] is considered a 10.

Position on the scale is determined not from rainfall records but from field observation because humidity is influenced by several factors such as altitude or prevailing winds. Savory used the term brittleness because an easy practical observation is whether or not a dead grass stem or small dead twig is soft and easily bent by hand or so brittle it snaps. For these reasons it differs from an  [[aridity index]]. Thus, some high rainfall environments, e.g., Zambia, with 2,000&amp;nbsp;mm annual rainfall and distinct wet and dry seasons, is higher on the brittleness scale because of the long portions of the year without rainfall. An environment with lower total rainfall distributed fairly evenly throughout the year, such as parts of England with 600&amp;nbsp;mm annually, are lower on the brittleness scale.

==Effect of brittleness==

Grass leaves and stems that die off above ground every year following the growing season break down slowly and mainly through oxidation in sunlight and physical weathering in the more brittle environments. And trees dying in such environments tend to remain standing for many years again gradually breaking down through oxidation and weathering from the top down. At the opposite end of the scale where humidity distribution is more even dead plant material tends to break down rapidly through high micro-organism activity or biological decay. Commonly a dead tree will decay at the base, fall and decay on the ground. Other observations Savory made were that at the lower end of the scale most herbivores naturally were insects with few large herbivores and solitary predators, while moving toward the higher end large herding herbivores and pack-hunting predators increased.

The effect of resting the environment to allow recovery and maintenance of biodiversity is different across the brittleness scale. At the low end resting the environment as in establishing wilderness or conservation is the most powerful action possible to restore biodiversity. Moving across the scale the same practice can become increasingly damaging to the health of entire communities. This is why Savory argued that abandoned cities of past ages low on the scale are today found under recovered tropical forest, while abandoned cities at the other end in former savannas are today found under desert sands. Total protection by removing all livestock leads to recovery of biodiversity in the perennially humid environments in the US, but the same practice in places such as New Mexico has led to severe desertification.

The '''Science Media Centre''' is an organisation which formed in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=The Lancet|title=Fiona Fox|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61099-0|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)61099-0/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt;,
two years after the [[United Kingdom]] [[House of Lords]] [[Select Committee (Westminster System)|Select Committee]] on Science and Technology's third report on "Science and Society" in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/38/3810.htm|title=House of Lords - Science and Technology - Third Report|website=www.publications.parliament.uk|access-date=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2016}}

This report stated that while science was generally reported accurately in the mass media, there was a need for the promotion of more expert information at times when science is under attack in the headlines, mentioning the public reaction to GM crops, in particular.

==Functions==
In order to promote more informed science in the media, the Centre's main function is as a service to journalists, providing background briefings on current scientific issues and facilitating interviews with scientists. Its director is [[Fiona Fox (UK press officer)|Fiona Fox]] who is a former member of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party (UK, 1978)|Revolutionary Communist Party]] and a former contributor to its magazine ''[[Living Marxism]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/apr/19/farmingforthefuture | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Clear intentions | first=Peter | last=Melchett | date=19 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
The SMC's stated aim is to "facilitate more scientists to engage with the media, in the hope that the public will have improved access to accurate, evidence-based scientific information about the stories of the day".

==Structure==
The setting up of the Science Media Centre was assisted by [[Susan Greenfield]], the director of the [[Royal Institution of Great Britain]]. While the Centre is still based in a specially refurbished wing of the Royal Institution, full independence is claimed from all funders and supporters.

The Science Media Centre is funded by over 60 organisations, with individual donations capped at £12,500 per annum. The SMC receives sponsorship from a range of funders including media organisations, universities, scientific and learned societies, the [[Research Councils UK|UK Research Councils]], government bodies, [[Quango]]s, charities, private donors and corporate bodies. For an up-to-date list of funders, see [http://www.sciencemediacentre.org/funding.htm].

==Criticism==

A 2013 article in ''Nature'' stated about the SMC, "Perhaps the biggest criticism of Fox and the SMC is that they push science too aggressively — acting more as a PR agency than as a source of accurate science information."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/science-media-centre-of-attention-1.13362|title=Science media: Centre of attention|year=2013|author=Nature|doi=10.1038/499142a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Ronan Bennett]] and [[Alan Rusbridger]] described the SMC as a lobby group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2002/jun/02/gm.observersciencepages|title=Lobby group 'led GM thriller critics'|author=The Guardian|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other SMCs==
During Professor Greenfield's term as [[Thinker in Residence]] in South Australia, a new [[Australian Science Media Centre]] was set up in [[Adelaide]], Australia in August 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Origins|url=http://www.aussmc.org/about-us/our-origins/|publisher=Australian Science Media Centre|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkers.sa.gov.au/thinkers/greenfield/impacts.aspx|title=Adelaide Thinkers in Residence - Impacts|publisher=Govt. of South Australia|accessdate=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science Media Centres now exist in other countries; [[Science Media Centre of Canada|Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], Japan, and Germany. Except for the relation between the Science Media Centre in UK and the Australian Science Media Centre, these centres are independent of each other.

==Early life and education==
{{expand section|date= April 2017}}
Atran was born in [[New York City]] in 1952.

While a student, he became assistant to anthropologist [[Margaret Mead]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. He received his BA from [[Columbia College, Columbia University|Columbia College]], MA from [[Johns Hopkins University]], and PhD in [[anthropology]] from [[Columbia University]].

==Career==
Atran has taught at Cambridge University, [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]], the [[École des Hautes Études]] and [[École Polytechnique]] in Paris, and [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]] in New York City. He is a research director in anthropology at the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] and member of the [[Jean Nicod Institute]] at the [[École Normale Supérieure]]. He is also research professor of [[public policy]] and [[psychology]] at the [[University of Michigan]], founding fellow of the Centre for the Resolution of Intractable Conflict at [[Oxford University]], and cofounder of ARTIS International.

===Early years===
In 1974 he originated a debate at the Abbaye de Royaumont in France on the nature of universals in human thought and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| editor-first= Lawrence |editor-last= Kritzman| title= The Columbia History of Twentieth-Century French Thought| place= New York| publisher= Columbia University Press| year= 2006| pages= 179–180| isbn= 978-0-231-10791-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other participants included linguist [[Noam Chomsky]], psychologist [[Jean Piaget]], anthropologists [[Gregory Bateson]] and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last= Kwong |first= Emily |url=  http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&amp;d=cs20091117-01.2.6 |title=Columbia antro dept. remembers Claude Lévi-Strauss |publisher=Columbia Spectator |date=November 17, 2009 |accessdate=July 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and biologists [[François Jacob]] and [[Jacques Monod]], which Harvard's [[Howard Gardner]] and others consider a milestone in the development of cognitive science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Harold| last= Gardner| chapter= Encounter at Royaumont| title=Art, Mind, and Brain: A Cognitive Approach to Creativity| place= New York| publisher= Basic Books| year= 1982| pages= 16–26| isbn= 978-0-465-00444-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Atran has also been a staunch opponent of political attempts to eliminate government funding for social science, arguing that it is critical to the national interest, including innovation and security in business, technology, medicine and defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2013/03/15/social_warfare_budget_republicans |title=Social Warfare |work=Foreign Policy |date=March 15, 2013 |accessdate=March 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has collaborated on research on how political negotiations could be made more likely to produce agreement. Atran and the psychologists [[Jeremy Ginges]] and [[Douglas Medin]] and political scientist [[Khalil Shikaki]] conducted an experiment that surveyed "600 Jewish settlers in the West Bank, more than 500 Palestinian refugees, and more than 700 Palestinian students, half of whom identified with Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad."&lt;ref name="sacred bounds"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Jeremy |last1=Ginges |first2=Scott |last2=Atran |first3=Douglas |last3=Medin |first4=Khalil |last4= Shikaki |title=Sacred bounds on rational resolution of violent political conflict |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |year=2007 |volume=104 |issue=18 |pages=7357–60 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0701768104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels"&gt;{{cite book| first= Steven| last= Pinker| title= The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined| publisher= Viking Press| year= 2011| isbn= 978-0-670-02295-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|638}} The researchers divided the subjects into three groups, each of which was presented with a different "hypothetical peace deal." In the basic situation, those surveyed were presented with "a two-state solution in which the Israelis would withdraw from 99 percent of the West Bank and Gaza but would not have to absorb Palestinian refugees"; the proposal "did not go over well."&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels" /&gt;{{rp|638}} For the second group, the hypothetical deal "was sweetened with cash compensation from the United States and the European Union, such as a billion dollars a year for a hundred years, or a guarantee that the people would live in peace and prosperity. With these sweeteners on the table, the nonabsolutists, as expected, softened their opposition a bit. But the absolutists, forced to contemplate a taboo tradeoff, were even more disgusted, angry, and prepared to resort to violence."&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels" /&gt;{{rp|638–39}} But for the third group, the proposed two-state solution was "augmented with a purely symbolic declaration by the enemy in which it compromised on one of its sacred values."

In the deal presented to Israeli settlers, the Palestinians "would give up any claims to their right of return" or "would be required to recognize the historic and legitimate right of the Jewish people to Eretz Israel";&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels" /&gt;{{rp|639}} in that presented to the Palestinians, Israel "would recognize the historic and legitimate right of the Palestinians to their own state and would apologize for all wrongs done to the Palestinian people," or would "give up what they believe is their sacred right to the West Bank" or would "symbolically recognize the historic legitimacy of the right of return [without in fact granting it]".&lt;ref name="sacred bounds" /&gt; In summarizing the result, cognitive psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] claims, "Unlike the bribes of money or peace, the symbolic concession of a sacred value by the enemy, especially when it acknowledges a sacred value on one's own side, reduced the absolutists' anger, disgust, and willingness to endorse violence."&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels" /&gt;{{rp|639}}

In a study of Middle East leaders published in [[Science (journal)]], Atran interviewed leaders, as distinct from popular views. In the earlier responses, people rejected material concessions without symbolic concessions, but were open to negotiations that started with symbolic concessions. Leaders responded the same way, except that they saw the symbolic concession as only an introduction to significant material concessions as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Atran |first=Scott |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/317/5841/1039 |title=Sacred Barriers to Conflict Resolution |work=American Association for the Advancement of Science |date=August 24, 2007 |accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, when the researchers asked [[Musa Abu Marzouk]], deputy chairman of Hamas, about a trade-off for peace without granting a right of return, he said “No.” When he was offered a trade-off with a substantial material incentive, he said “No” even more emphatically; “we do not sell ourselves for any amount.” But when he was offered an apology, he said “Yes,” although an apology would only be a beginning. “Our houses and land were taken away from us and something has to be done about that.”

Similarly, when the researchers asked [[Binyamin Netanyahu]] (then opposition leader), “Would you seriously consider accepting a two-state solution following the 1967 borders if all major Palestinian factions, including Hamas, were to recognize the right of the Jewish people to an independent state in the region?” he said, “Yes, but the Palestinians would have to show that they sincerely mean it, change their textbooks and anti-Semitic characterizations and then allow some border adjustments so that Ben Gurion [Airport] would be out of range of shoulder-fired missiles.”

====Field research on terrorism====
His work on the ideology and social evolution of transnational terrorism, which has included fieldwork with [[mujahedin]] and supporters in Europe, the Middle East, Central and Southeast Asia, and North Africa, has challenged common assumptions. Cognitive psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] summarizes some of Atran's findings thus: 
{{quote|Far from being ignorant, impoverished, nihilistic, or mentally ill, suicide terrorists tend to be educated, middle class, morally engaged, and free of obvious psychopathology. Atran concluded that many of the motives may be found in nepotistic altruism... [Atran shows that] [[Hamas]] and other Palestinian terrorist groups [hold] out a carrot rather than a stick to the terrorist's family in the form of generous monthly stipends, lump-sum payments, and massive prestige in the community.... Atran has [also] found that suicide terrorists can be recruited without these direct incentives. Probably the most effective call to martyrdom is the opportunity to join a happy band of brothers. Terrorist cells often begin as gangs of underemployed single young men who come together in cafes, dorms, soccer clubs, barbershops, or Internet chat rooms and suddenly find meaning in their lives by a commitment to the new platoon.... Commitment to the group is intensified by religion, not just the literal promise of paradise but the feeling of spiritual awe that comes from submerging oneself in a crusade, a calling, a vision quest, or a jihad. [Atran writes that religion] may also turn a commitment to a cause into a sacred value — a good that may not be traded off against something else, including life itself. The commitment can be further stoked by the thirst for revenge, which in the case of militant Islamism takes the form of vengeance for the harm and humiliation suffered by any Muslim anywhere on the planet at any time in history, or for symbolic affronts such as the presence of infidel soldiers on sacred Muslim soil.&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels" /&gt;{{rp|356–57}} }}

Atran has summarized his work and conclusions: 
{{quote|When you look at young people like the ones who grew up to blow up trains in Madrid in 2004, carried out the slaughter on the London underground in 2005, hoped to blast airliners out of the sky en route to the United States in 2006 and 2009, and journeyed far to die killing infidels in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen or Somalia; when you look at whom they idolize, how they organize, what bonds them and what drives them; then you see that what inspires the most lethal terrorists in the world today is not so much the Koran or religious teachings as a thrilling cause and call to action that promises glory and esteem in the eyes of friends, and through friends, eternal respect and remembrance in the wider world that they will never live to enjoy.... Jihad is an egalitarian, equal-opportunity employer: ...fraternal, fast-breaking, thrilling, glorious, and cool.| Scott Atran, Testimony before U.S. Senate&lt;ref name="Pinker Angels" /&gt;{{rp|357–58}} }}

Regarding Atran's analysis of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] as a revolutionary movement of "world-historic proportions,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Atran |first=Scott |url=https://aeon.co/essays/why-isis-has-the-potential-to-be-a-world-altering-revolution |title=ISIS is a Revolution |work=AEON |date=December 15, 2016 |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Atran |first=Scott |url=https://instagloss.com/read/tempsreel.nouvelobs.com-monde-20160129.obs3681-l-etat-islamique-est-une-revolution-par-scott-atran.html |title=L'Etat islamique est une révolution, par Scott Atran |work=L'OBS |language= French| date=February 2, 2016 |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a writer for ''The New York Times'' considers Atran: 
{{quote|...a top anthropologist in Paris [who has combined] his research among disaffected youth with insights from such disparate figures as Hitler, Burke, Darwin and Hobbes, as well as close observation of the Islamic State’s advance into a 'globe-spanning jihadi archipelago'. He argues that we dismiss ISIS at our peril, and that in fact, we do much to promote its growth. Some of his historical conclusions will be controversial, but this is French intellectualism at its most profound — and most useful. Here’s a telling anecdote: When [[Charlie Chaplin]] and the French filmmaker [[René Clair]] watched '[[Triumph of the Will]]' (1935), [[Leni Riefenstahl]]’s visual paean to National Socialism, 'Chaplin laughed but Clair was terror-stricken, fearing that, if it were shown more widely, all might be lost in the West'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nordland |first=Ron |url= http://news.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/12/what-were-reading-120/ |title=The Allure of ISIS |work=The New York Times  |date=January 12, 2016 |accessdate=February 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] accompanied Atran to frontlines in the battle against ISIS in Iraq, where he and his research team were assessing "will to fight" among the combatants: 
{{quote|Atran  fleshes out what he calls the 'Devoted Actor Framework' [as opposed to standard 'rational actor' frameworks], which pulls sacred values [which are immune to material trade offs] and identity fusion [complete merging of individual identity with group identity] into a single theory and offers advice for beating ISIS: 'The science suggests that sacred values are best opposed with other sacred values that inspire devotion, or by sundering the fused social networks that embed those values.' Left unspoken: How do you offer an equally inspiring alternative? By what method can those social networks be sundered? Atran doesn’t pretend to know the answer, but he does think that current attempts at so-called "countermessaging" are destined to fail because those messages are 'disembodied from the social networks in which ideas are embedded and given life.' Scholarly squabbles aside, there is near-universal admiration, bordering on awe, for how Atran is able to collect data in the midst of a violent conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bartlett |first=Tom |url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Scientist-Who-Talks-to/236521 |title=The Road to ISIS: An unorthodox anthropologist goes face to face with ISIS.

A series of experimental studies directed by Atran and social psychologist Ángel Gómez&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0193-3 |title=The devoted actor’s will to fight and the spiritual dimension of human conflict |journal=Nature Human Behaviour |year=2017 |volume=1 |doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0193-3 |pages=673–679 | last1 = Gómez | first1 = Ángel | last2 = López-Rodríguez | first2 = Lucía | last3 = Sheikh | first3 = Hammad | last4 = Ginges | first4 = Jeremy | last5 = Wilson | first5 = Lydia | last6 = Waziri | first6 = Hoshang | last7 = Vázquez | first7 = Alexandra | last8 = Davis | first8 = Richard | last9 = Atran | first9 = Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed with captured ISIS fighters, fighters of the Kurdistan Workers Party ([[PKK]]), [[Peshmerga]], Iraq Army and Arab Sunni Militia in Iraq, as well as with thousands of ordinary European citizens, have further elaborated the Devoted Actor framework in an effort to “help to inform policy decisions for the common defense.” According to reporting from ''CNN'':
{{quote|The researchers discovered that three crucial factors motivate both ISIS fighters and those fighting them: a deep commitment to sacred values, the readiness to forsake family for those values, and the perceived spiritual strength of the group or community that the fighter represents. [But] 'in our material world, we have underestimated or underplayed the spiritual dimension of human action,' [Atran] said. 'Doing so runs the risk of leaving ourselves open to people who are motivated by deeper spiritual and sacred values and virtues, and I think that's the greatest danger we face.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Howard |first=Jacqueline |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/04/health/isis-fighters-human-behavior-study/index.html |title=What motivates ISIS fighters -- and those who fight against them |work=CNN  |date=September 4, 2017 |accessdate=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Atran argues in an interview in ''The Washington Post'' that: "Never in history have so few people with so few means caused so much fear."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gebelhoff |first=Robert |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/in-theory/wp/2017/02/03/rethinking-the-war-on-terror-with-the-help-of-science/ |title=Rethinking the war on terrorism, with the help of science |work=The Washington Post  |date=February 3, 2017 |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his research colleagues at ARTIS International contend that: 
{{quote|Despite intense efforts by intelligence agencies and countless conferences, articles, and books, fundamental aspects of terrorism remain unclear: What identifies terrorists before they act; how do they radicalize; what motivates their violence; when do they act; what countermeasures are most effective? These efforts to find answers have fallen short in part because... policymakers tend to fit such information to prevailing paradigms in foreign policy, military doctrine, and criminal justice, each with serious drawbacks when applied to terrorism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6323/352 |title=Challenges in researching terrorism from the field | first1= Scott| last1= Atran| first2= Robert| last2= Axelrod| first3= Richard| last3= Davis| first4= Baruch| last4= Fischhoff |work=Science |date=January 27, 2017 |accessdate=April 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Atran and colleagues propose an alternative approach, driven by theoretically-framed field research that ground-truths big data and informs policy-making while maintaining intellectual independence. In 2017, Atran co-authored a groundbreaking paper with Angel Gomez, Lucia Lopez-Rodriguez, Hammad Sheikh, Jeremy Ginges, Lydia Wilson, Hoshang Waziri, Alexandra Vazquez, and Richard Davis. Titled 'The Devoted Actor's Will to Fight and the Spiritual Dimension of Human Conflict',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gómez|first=Ángel|last2=López-Rodríguez|first2=Lucía|last3=Sheikh|first3=Hammad|last4=Ginges|first4=Jeremy|last5=Wilson|first5=Lydia|last6=Waziri|first6=Hoshang|last7=Vázquez|first7=Alexandra|last8=Davis|first8=Richard|last9=Atran|first9=Scott|date=September 2017|title=The devoted actor’s will to fight and the spiritual dimension of human conflict|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0193-3|journal=Nature Human Behaviour|language=En|volume=1|issue=9|pages=673–679|doi=10.1038/s41562-017-0193-3|issn=2397-3374}}&lt;/ref&gt; the piece focuses on the spiritual dimensions of conflict based upon field work in Iraq with combatants and lab studies, assessing non-utilitarian dimensions of conflict.

'''Shape grammars''' in computation are a specific class of [[production system (computer science)|production system]]s that generate geometric shapes. Typically, shapes are 2- or 3-dimensional, thus shape grammars are a way to study 2- and 3-dimensional languages. The foundation of shape grammars has been defined in a seminal article by [[George Stiny]] and [[James Gips]] in 1971.&lt;ref name="stiny1972"&gt;Stiny, G. &amp; Gips, J. (1972). Shape grammars and the generative specification of painting and sculpture. In Information Processing 71, 1460–1465. North-Holland Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
A shape grammar consists of ''shape rules'' and a ''generation engine'' that selects and processes rules. A shape rule defines how an existing (part of a) shape can be transformed. A shape rule consists of two parts separated by an arrow pointing from left to right. The part left of the arrow is termed the ''Left-Hand Side'' (LHS). It depicts a condition in terms of a shape and a marker. The part right of the arrow is termed the ''Right-Hand Side'' (RHS). It depicts how the LHS shape should be transformed and where the marker is positioned. The marker helps to locate and orient the new shape.

A shape grammar minimally consists of three shape rules: a ''start rule'', at least one transformation rule, and a ''termination rule''. The start rule is necessary to start the shape generation process. The termination rule is necessary to make the shape generation process stop. The simplest way to stop the process is by a shape rule that removes the marker. Shape grammars differ from Chomsky grammars a major respect: the production rules may be applied serially (as with Chomsky grammars) or in parallel (not allowed in [[Chomsky hierarchy|Chomsky grammars]]), similar to the way "productions" are done in [[L-System]]s.

A shape grammar system additionally has a working area where the created geometry is displayed. The generation engine checks the existing geometry, often referred to as ''Current Working Shape'' (CWS), for conditions that match the LHS of the shape rules. Shape rules with matching LHS are eligible for use. If more than one rule applies, the generation engine has to choose which rule to apply. In the alternative scenario, the engine first chooses one of the grammar rules and then tries to find all matches of the LHS of this rule in the CWS. If there are several matches, the engine can (depending on its configuration/implementation)
*apply the rule to all matches in parallel, 
*apply the rule to all matches serially (which might lead to inconsistencies) or 
*choose one of the detected matches and apply the rule to only this match.

Shape grammars are most useful when confined to a small, well-defined generation problem such as housing layouts and structure refinement. Because shape rules typically are defined on small shapes, a shape grammar can quickly contain a lot of rules. The palladian villas shape grammar presented by William Mitchell&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, W. (1990). The Logic of Architecture. MIT Press, London.&lt;/ref&gt; for example contains 69 rules, that are applied throughout eight stages.

'''Parametric shape grammars''' are an extension of shape grammars.&lt;ref&gt;Stiny, G. (1980). Introduction to shape and shape grammars. Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design 7(3), 343-351.&lt;/ref&gt; The new shape in the RHS of the shape rule is defined by [[parameter]]s so that it can take into account more of the context of the already existing shapes. This typically affects internal proportions of the new shape so that a greater variety of forms can be created. In this way, attempts are made to make shape grammars respond to structural conditions, for example the width of beams in roof structures which depends on span.

Despite their popularity and applicability in academic circles, shape grammars have not found widespread use in generic [[Computer Aided Design]] applications.

==Applications==
Shape grammars were originally presented for painting and sculpture&lt;ref name="stiny1972" /&gt; but have been studied in particular in architecture ([[computer-aided architectural design]]), as they provide a formalism to create new designs. Other important domains shape grammars have been applied in are decorative arts, industrial design and engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Cagan, J. (2001).

In [[Biblical criticism]], '''''Sitz im Leben''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈzɪt͡s ɪm ˈle:bn̩}}) is a [[German language|German]] phrase roughly translating to "setting in life". It stands for the alleged context in which a text, or object, has been created, and its function and purpose at that time. The ''Sitz im Leben'' is also used to refer to the social, ethnic and cultural setting of a site at a particular era. When interpreting a text, object, or region, the ''Sitz im Leben'' has to be taken into consideration in order to allow a proper contextual interpretation. 

==Origins==
The term originated with the German Protestant theologian [[Hermann Gunkel]]. The term ''Sitz im Volksleben'' ("setting in the life of the people") was employed for the first time in 1906 and the term ''Sitz im Leben'' in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;''Prophets and paradigms: essays in honor of Gene M. Tucker'' ed. Gene M. Tucker, Stephen Breck Reid 1996 p. 113 Form-Criticism of the Old Testament (Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1971&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Sitz im Leben'' was used by classic form critics, as pointed out by Chris Tuckett, "...it has been pointed out that the term ''Sitz im Leben'' was used in a rather peculiar way by the classic [[Form criticism|form critics]]. In fact the term is a sociological one, describing a typical situation within any community"&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Mark Tuckett ''Reading the New Testament: methods of interpretation'' 1987 – 200.14"&lt;/ref&gt; so that the meaning of the text is bound up with its function in the community,&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Kraus, R. Glenn Wooden ''Septuagint research: issues and challenges'' 2006 p. 23 "With the introduction of the term ''Sitz im Leben'' we see that for NETS the meaning and significance of the text is bound up with its inferred function within the community that produced it."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Contextualization (sociolinguistics)|social context]].&lt;ref&gt;Rolf Rendtorff ''The Old Testament: an introduction'' 1985 "Gunkel's term 'Sitz im Leben' denotes a particular situation of communication with which a genre – or even several genres – may be connected. In a more comprehensive sense the term can therefore also denote the social context in ..."&lt;/ref&gt; However some have noted that use in Biblical [[exegesis]] can be problematic.&lt;ref&gt;W. S. Vorster, J. Eugene Botha – ''Speaking of Jesus: essays on biblical language, gospel narrative'' 1999 p. 336 ("The use of the term ''Sitz im Leben'' has become very misleading and problematic, see Guttgemanns 1970:82ff.")&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contextualization==
At its simplest, it describes what occasions certain passages in the [[Bible]] were written for, and is often called the "genres" of the Bible.{{Citation needed|date= December 2014}} Simple examples of ''Sitz im Leben'' include the classification of material into letters, poems of lament, [[parable]]s, [[psalms]], and songs. However, ''Sitz im Leben'' can also involve many other considerations; who the speaker of a passage was, his role in life, the nature of his audience, and so on.{{Citation needed|date= December 2014}} Taken out of its original [[Context principle|context]], the original meaning of a passage is often lost. So for example, a psalm may have its ''Sitz'' in the ritual of the temple cult, or as an artistic votive offering, or in the sense of injustice arising from a power structure in Jerusalem society, or lament in defeat. A major aim of [[hermeneutics]] ([[Contextualization (Bible translation)|contextualizing interpretation]]) is to uncover such things.{{Citation needed|date= December 2014}}

The term is also used to describe the contextual interpretation of archaeological artefacts and ancient sites. Only through examining the historical context can one properly interpret them.

==Development==
Today the term is also used outside theological research, when it is needed to examine a text for its sociologically relevant aspects. For example: the ''Sitz im Leben'' of a [[counting rhyme]] like "[[eeny, meeny, miny, moe]]" is a group of children deciding among themselves who will play in a game; when the children chant the song, we know that they are choosing who will play, but if we are unaware of this context, the rhyme appears merely to be nonsense about toes.{{Citation needed|date= December 2014}}

In [[linguistics]] the ''Sitz im Leben'' is determined by the text [[pragmatics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Medienkultur und Medienlinguistik.

The '''Sothic cycle''' or '''Canicular period''' is a period of 1,461 [[Egyptian civil year]]s of 365 days each or 1,460 [[Julian calendar|Julian years]] averaging 365¼ days each. During a Sothic cycle, the 365-day year loses enough time that the start of its year once again coincides with the [[heliacal rising]] of the star [[Sirius]] ({{lang-egy|[[wikt:spdt|Spdt]]}} or ''[[Sopdet]]'', "Triangle"; {{lang-grc-gre|Σῶθις}}, ''Sō̂this'') on 19 July in the [[Julian calendar]].&lt;ref name=lavia/&gt;{{efn|The date slowly varies within the [[Gregorian calendar]], owing to its omission of three leap years every four centuries. It presently occurs on 3 August.&lt;ref name=lavia&gt;{{citation |contribution-url=http://www.lavia.org/english/archivo/egyptiancalendaren.html |contribution=Ancient Egyptian Civil Calendar |title=La Via |url=http://www.lavia.org/indexIT.html |accessdate=8 February 2017 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} It is an important aspect of [[Egyptology]], particularly with regard to reconstructions of the [[Egyptian calendar]] and its history. [[Egyptian astronomy|Astronomical records]] of this displacement may have been responsible for the later establishment of the more accurate [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Alexandrian calendar]]s.

==Mechanics==
The [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian calendar|civil year]], its holidays, and religious records reflect its apparent establishment at a point when the [[heliacal rising|return]] of the bright star [[Sirius (star)|Sirius]] to the night sky was considered to herald the [[flooding of the Nile|annual flooding]] of the [[Nile]].&lt;ref name=teacosy/&gt; However, because the civil calendar was exactly 365 days long and did not incorporate [[leap year]]s until 22{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, its months "wandered" backwards through the [[solar year]] at the rate of about one day in every four years. This almost exactly corresponded to its displacement against the {{nowrap|'''Sothic year'''}} as well. (The Sothic year is about a minute longer than a [[solar year]].)&lt;ref name=teacosy&gt;{{harvp|Tetley|2014|p=[http://www.egyptchronology.com/uploads/2/6/9/4/26943741/ch_3_investigating_ancient_egyptian_calendars.pdf 42]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sidereal year]] of 365.25636 days is only valid for stars on the [[ecliptic]] (the apparent path of the [[Sun]] across the sky), whereas Sirius's displacement ~40˚ below the ecliptic, its [[proper motion]], and the wobbling of the [[celestial equator]] cause the period between its [[heliacal rising]]s to be almost exactly 365.25 days long instead. This steady loss of one relative day every four years over the course of the 365-day calendar meant that the "wandering" day would return to its original place relative to the solar and Sothic year after precisely 1461 civil or 1460 Julian years.

==Discovery==
This cycle was first noticed by [[Eduard Meyer]] in 1904, who then carefully combed known Egyptian inscriptions and written materials to find any mention of the calendar dates when Sirius rose at dawn. He found six of them, on which the dates of much of the [[conventional Egyptian chronology]] are based. A heliacal rise of Sirius was recorded by [[Censorinus]] as having happened on the Egyptian New Year's Day between {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}139 and 142.&lt;ref name=Kitchen&gt;Kitchen, K. A. ''The Chronology of Ancient Egypt.'' p.205. World Archaeology,  Vol. 23, No. 2 (October 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The record actually refers to 21{{nbsp}}July {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}140 but is astronomically calculated as a definite 20{{nbsp}}July {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}139. This correlates the Egyptian calendar to the Julian calendar. Leap day occurs in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}140, and so the new year on 1{{nbsp}}[[Thoth (month)|Thoth]] is 20{{nbsp}}July in {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}139 but it is 19{{nbsp}}July for {{sc|ad}}{{nbsp}}140-142. Thus he was able to compare the day on which Sirius rose in the Egyptian calendar to the day on which Sirius ought to have risen in the Julian calendar, count the number of intercalary days needed, and determine how many years were between the beginning of a cycle and the observation. One also needs to know the place of observation, since the latitude of the observation changes the day when the heliacal rising of Sirius occurs, and mislocating an observation can potentially change the resulting chronology by several decades.&lt;ref name=Kitchen/&gt; (Official observations were made at [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] or [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] near [[Cairo]], [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]], and [[Elephantine]] near [[Aswan]],&lt;ref name=teatime/&gt; with the rising of Sirius observed at Cairo about 8 days after it is seen at Aswan.)&lt;ref name=teatime&gt;{{citation |last=Tetley |first=M. Christine |title=The Reconstructed Chronology of the Egyptian Kings, ''Vol. I'' |url=http://www.egyptchronology.com/vols-1--2.html |date=2014 |p=[http://www.egyptchronology.com/uploads/2/6/9/4/26943741/ch_3_investigating_ancient_egyptian_calendars.pdf 43] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075421/http://www.egyptchronology.com/vols-1--2.html |archivedate=2017-02-11 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer concluded from an ivory tablet from the reign of [[Djer]] that the Egyptian civil calendar was created in [[5th millennium BC|4241{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}]],{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} a date that appears in a number of old books. But research and discoveries have since shown that the [[first dynasty of Egypt]] did not begin before {{nowrap|c. [[4th millennium BC|3100 {{sc|bc}}]]}}, and the claim that 19{{nbsp}}July 4241{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} is the "earliest fixed date" has since been discredited. Most scholars either move the observation upon which he based this forward by one cycle of Sirius to 19{{nbsp}}July 2781{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} or reject the assumption that the document in question indicates a rise of Sirius at all.&lt;ref name=Grimal&gt;Grimal, Nicolas. ''A History of Ancient Egypt.'' p.52. Librairie Arthéme Fayard, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronological interpretation==
Three specific observations of the heliacal rise of Sirius are extremely important for Egyptian chronology. The first is the aforementioned ivory tablet from the reign of [[Djer]] which supposedly indicates the beginning of a Sothic cycle, the rising of Sirius on the same day as the new year. If this does indicate the beginning of a Sothic cycle, it must date to about 17 July 2773{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Nicolas. ''A History of Ancient Egypt.'' p.51. Librairie Arthéme Fayard, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this date is too late for Djer's reign, so many scholars believe that it indicates a correlation between the rising of Sirius and the Egyptian ''lunar'' calendar, instead of the solar civil calendar, which would render the tablet essentially devoid of chronological value.&lt;ref name=Grimal/&gt;
A newly discovered Sothis-date from the Old Kingdom and a subsequent astronomic study confirms the Sothic cycle model [http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/18741665-12340035 Gautschy et al. 2017 A New Astronomically Based Chronological Model for the Egyptian Old Kingdom]

The second observation is clearly a reference to a heliacal rising, and is believed to date to the seventh year of [[Senusret III]]. This observation was almost certainly made at [[Itj-Tawy]], the Twelfth Dynasty capital, which would date the Twelfth Dynasty from 1963 to 1786{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}.&lt;ref name=Kitchen/&gt; The Ramses or Turin Papyrus Canon says 213 years (1991-1778{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}), [[Richard Anthony Parker|Parker]] reduces it to 206 years (1991-1785{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}), based on 17{{nbsp}}July 1872{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} as the Sothic date (120th year of 12th dynasty, a drift of 30 leap days). Prior to Parker's investigation of lunar dates the 12th dynasty was placed as 213 years of 2007-1794{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} perceiving the date as 21 July 1888{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} as the 120th year, and then as 2003-1790{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} perceiving the date as 20 July 1884{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} as the 120th year.

The third observation was in the reign of [[Amenhotep I]], and, assuming it was made in Thebes, dates his reign between 1525 and 1504{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}. If made in Memphis, Heliopolis, or some other Delta site instead, as a minority of scholars still argue, the entire chronology of the 18th Dynasty needs to be expanded by some 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;Grimal, Nicolas. ''A History of Ancient Egypt.'' p.202. Librairie Arthéme Fayard, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Observational mechanics and precession==
The Sothic cycle is a specific example of two cycles of differing length interacting to cycle together, here called a tertiary cycle. This is mathematically defined by the formula 1/a + 1/b = 1/t or half the [[harmonic mean]]. In the case of the Sothic cycle the two cycles are the Egyptian civil year and the Sothic year. 

The Sothic year is the length of time for the star Sirius to visually return to the same position in relation to the sun. Star years measured in this way vary due to [[axial precession]],&lt;ref&gt;Ingham, M. F. "The Length of the Sothic Cycle", ''The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology'', '''55''' (1969), p. 36-40.&lt;/ref&gt; the movement of the Earth's axis in relation to the sun. The length of time for a star to make a yearly path can be marked when it rises to a defined altitude above a local horizon at the time of sunrise. This altitude does not have to be the altitude of first possible visibility. Throughout the year the star will rise approximately four minutes earlier each successive sunrise. Eventually the star will return to its same relative location at sunrise. This length of time can be called an observational year. Stars that reside close to the ecliptic or the ecliptic meridian will on average exhibit observational years close to the sidereal year of 365.2564 days. The ecliptic and the meridian cut the sky into four quadrants. The axis of the earth wobbles around slowly moving the observer and changing the observation of the event. If the axis swings the observer closer to the event its observational year will be shortened. Likewise, the observational year can be lengthened when the axis swings away from the observer. This depends upon which quadrant of the sky the phenomenon is observed.

The Sothic year is remarkable because its average duration was exactly 365.25 days in the early {{nowrap|4th millennium {{sc|bc}}&lt;ref&gt;SkyCharts III&lt;/ref&gt;}} before the unification of Egypt. The slow rate of change from this value is also of note. If observations and records could have been maintained during predynastic times the Sothic rise would optimally return to the same calendar day after 1461 calendar years. This value would drop to about 1456 calendar years by the Middle Kingdom. The 1461 value could also be maintained if the date of the Sothic rise were artificially maintained by moving the feast in celebration of this event one day every fourth year instead of rarely adjusting it according to observation.

It has been noticed, and the Sothic cycle confirms, that Sirius does not move retrograde across the sky like other stars, a phenomenon widely known as the [[precession of the equinox]]. Professor [[Jed Buchwald]] wrote "Sirius remains about the same distance from the equinoxes—and so from the solstices—throughout these many centuries, despite precession." &lt;ref&gt;Buchwald, Jed Z. (2003), [http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/4096/1/Egyptian.pdf "Egyptian Stars under Paris Skies"], ''Engineering and Science'' (Caltech), 66 (4) (2003) 20–31.&lt;/ref&gt;  For the same reason, the helical rising or zenith of Sirius does not slip through the calendar at the precession rate of about one day per 71.6 years as other stars do but much slower.&lt;ref&gt;One day per 120 years, see Winlock H., ''Origin of the Ancient Egyptian Calendar'', Proc. of the Am. Philosophical Soc., '''83''' (1940): 447-64.&lt;/ref&gt; This remarkable stability within the solar year may be one reason that the Egyptians used it as a basis for their calendar. The coincidence of a heliacal rising of Sirius and the New Year reported by Censorinus occurred about the 20th of July, that is a month later after the summer solstice.

==Problems and criticisms==
Determining the date of a heliacal rise of Sirius has been shown to be difficult, especially considering the need to know the exact latitude of the observation.&lt;ref name=Kitchen/&gt; Another problem is that because the Egyptian calendar loses one day every four years, a heliacal rise will take place on the same day for four years in a row, and any observation of that rise can date to any of those four years, making the observation imprecise.&lt;ref name=Kitchen/&gt;

A number of criticisms have been leveled against the reliability of dating by the Sothic cycle. Some are serious enough to be considered problematic.  Firstly, none of the astronomical observations have dates that mention the specific pharaoh in whose reign they were observed, forcing Egyptologists to supply that information on the basis of a certain amount of informed speculation.  Secondly, there is no information regarding the nature of the civil calendar throughout the course of Egyptian history, forcing Egyptologists to assume that it existed unchanged for thousands of years; the Egyptians would only have needed to carry out one calendar reform in a few thousand years for these calculations to be worthless.  Other criticisms are not considered as problematic, e.g. there is no extant mention of the Sothic cycle in ancient Egyptian writing, which may simply be a result of it either being so obvious to Egyptians that it didn't merit mention or to relevant texts being destroyed over time or still awaiting discovery.

One recent popular history of the Ancient Near East by Marc Van De Mierop, in his discussion of chronology and dating, does not mention the Sothic cycle at all, and believes that the bulk of historians nowadays would consider that it is not possible to put forward exact dates earlier than the 8th century BCE. &lt;ref&gt;Marc Van De Mieroop ''A History of the Ancient Near East, ca. 3000–323 B.C.''&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Some have recently claimed that the [[Theran eruption]] marks the beginning of the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth dynasty]] due to Theran ash and pumice discoveries in the ruins of [[Avaris]] in layers that mark the end of the Hyksos era{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}. Because the evidence of [[dendrochronology|dendrochronologists]] indicates the eruption took place in 1626 BC, this has been taken to indicate that dating by the Sothic cycle is off by 50–80 years at the outset of the 18th dynasty{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}. Claims that the Thera eruption is the subject of the [[Tempest Stele]] of [[Ahmose I]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ritner|first=Robert K|author2=Moeller, Nadine |title=The Ahmose ‘Tempest Stela’, Thera and Comparative Chronology|journal=Journal of Near Eastern Studies|date=2014|volume=73|issue=1|pages=1–19|doi=10.1086/675069|jstor=10.1086/675069}}&lt;/ref&gt;  have been disputed by writers such as [[Peter James (historian)|Peter James]].&lt;ref&gt;James, ''Centuries of Darkness'' (London, 1991: [http://www.centuries.co.uk/index.htm]).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{technical|date=October 2012}}
'''Spatial–temporal reasoning''' is an area of [[Artificial Intelligence|artificial intelligence]] which draws from the fields of [[computer science]], [[cognitive science]], and [[cognitive psychology]]. The theoretic goal—on the cognitive side—involves representing and reasoning spatial-temporal knowledge in mind. The applied goal—on the computing side—involves developing high-level control systems of robots for navigating and understanding time and space. 

== Influence from cognitive psychology ==
A convergent result in cognitive psychology is that the connection relation is the first spatial relation that human babies acquire, followed by understanding orientation relations and distance relations. Internal relations among the three kinds of spatial relations can be computationally and systematically explained within the theory of cognitive prism as follows: (1) the connection relation is primitive; (2) an orientation relation is a distance comparison relation: you being in front of me can be interpreted as you are nearer to my front side than my other sides; (3) a distance relation is connection relations using a third object: you being one meter away from me can be interpreted as an object with the maximum extension of one meter can be connected with you and me simultaneously. 

== Fragmentary representations of temporal calculi ==
Without addressing internal relations among spatial relations, AI researchers contributed many fragmentary representations. Examples of temporal calculi include [[Allen's interval algebra]], and Vilain's &amp; Kautz's [[point algebra]]. The most prominent spatial calculi are [[Mereotopology|mereotopological calculi]], [[Andrew U. Frank|Frank]]'s [[cardinal direction calculus]], Freksa's double cross calculus, Egenhofer and Franzosa's [[9-intersection calculus|4- and 9-intersection calculi]], Ligozat's [[flip-flop calculus]], various [[region connection calculus|region connection calculi]] (RCC), and the [[Oriented Point Relation Algebra]]. Recently, spatio-temporal calculi have been designed that combine spatial and temporal information. For example, the [[spatiotemporal constraint calculus]] (STCC) by Gerevini and Nebel combines Allen's interval algebra with RCC-8. Moreover, the [[qualitative trajectory calculus]] (QTC) allows for reasoning about moving objects.

== Quantitative abstraction ==
An emphasis in the literature has been on [[Qualitative reasoning|qualitative]] spatial-temporal reasoning which is based on qualitative abstractions of temporal and spatial aspects of the common-sense background knowledge on which our human perspective of physical reality is based.  Methodologically, qualitative [[Constraint satisfaction|constraint]] calculi restrict the vocabulary of rich mathematical theories dealing with temporal or spatial entities such that specific aspects of these theories can be treated within [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] fragments with simple qualitative (non-[[Metric (mathematics)|metric]]) languages. Contrary to mathematical or physical theories about space and time, qualitative constraint calculi allow for rather inexpensive reasoning about entities located in space and time.  For this reason, the limited expressiveness of qualitative representation formalism calculi is a benefit if such reasoning tasks need to be integrated in applications.  For example, some of these calculi may be implemented for handling spatial [[Geographic information system|GIS]] queries efficiently and some may be used for navigating, and communicating with, a mobile [[robot]].

== Relation algebra ==
Most of these calculi can be formalized as abstract [[relation algebra]]s, such that reasoning can be carried out at a symbolic level. For computing solutions of a [[constraint network]], the [[Local consistency#Path_consistency|path-consistency algorithm]] is an important tool.

The '''Taiwan Forestry Research Institute''' ('''TFRI'''; {{zh|c=林業試驗所|p=Línyè Shìyàn Suǒ}}) a research institute under the [[Council of Agriculture (Taiwan)|Council of Agriculture]] of the [[Taiwan|Taiwan (ROC)]] dealing with forest.

==History==

===Empire of Japan===
TRFI was originally established as a nursery on 6 January 1896 during the [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule of Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfri.gov.tw/main/index.aspx|title=About Us|publisher=Taiwan Forestry Research Institute|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1900, a new plot of land was purchased at the present location of [[Taipei Botanical Garden]] and the nursery was named the '''Taipei Nursery'''. In 1911, on the foundation of Taipei Nursery, the '''Forestry Experimental Station''' was established to handle the management of forest in Taiwan. In 1921, the Japanese government unified all research institutes in Taiwan and established the Central Research Institute which included the Forestry Experimental Station but was named the '''Forestry Division''' of the Central Research Institute. In 1939, the Central Research Institute was reorganized and the Forestry Division was made independent named '''Forestry Research Institute'''.

===Republic of China===
After the [[Retrocession Day|handover of Taiwan from Japan]] to the Republic of China, it was later renamed to '''Taiwan Forestry Research Institute''' on 1 November 1945 and placed under the [[Taiwan Provincial Government]]. In September 1949, the research institute was transferred under the [[Council of Agriculture (Taiwan)|Agriculture and Forestry Administration]]. In July 1999, the research institute was formally renamed '''Taiwan Forestry Research Institute, Council of Agriculture (COA), Executive Yuan'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfri.gov.tw/main/page_view.aspx?siteid=&amp;ver=&amp;usid=&amp;mnuid=5174&amp;modid=1341&amp;mode=|title=About Us|publisher=Taiwan Forestry Research Institute|accessdate=21 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47045">The '''Vienna Circle''' ({{lang-de|Wiener Kreis}}) of [[Logical Empiricism]] was a group of [[philosopher]]s and [[scientist]]s drawn from the [[Natural science|natural]] and [[Social Sciences|social sciences]], [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] who met regularly from 1924 to 1936 at the [[University of Vienna]], chaired by [[Moritz Schlick]].

[[File:Eingang Mathematisches Kolloquium.TIF|thumb|Entrance to the Mathematical Seminar at the [[University of Vienna]], Boltzmanngasse 5. Meeting place of the Vienna Circle.]]

==Overview==
Among the members of the inner circle were [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], [[Philipp Frank]], [[Otto Neurath]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Herbert Feigl]], [[Richard von Mises]], [[Karl Menger]], [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Friedrich Waismann]], [[Felix Kaufmann]], [[Viktor Kraft]] and [[Edgar Zilsel]]. In addition, the Vienna Circle was occasionally visited by [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Alfred Jules Ayer]], [[Oskar Morgenstern]]&lt;ref&gt;Oskar Morgenstern: ''The Collaboration Between Oskar Morgenstern and John von Neumann on the Theory of Games''. In: ''Journal of Economic Literature'', 14(3), 1976, p. 806.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frank P. Ramsey]].&lt;ref&gt;Cp. the partition into "inner circle" and "periphery" in Stadler 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]] were in close contact to the Vienna Circle, but never participated in the meetings of the Schlick Circle.&lt;ref&gt;From 1926 to 1933 there were occasional meetings of Wittgenstein with Schlick, Waismann, Carnap and Feigl. Cp. Stadler 2001, chapter on "Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle", 422–441.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On Popper and the Vienna Circle, cp. Stadler 2001, 453–473.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophical position of the Vienna Circle was called [[logical empiricism]] (German: ''logischer Empirismus''), [[logical positivism]] or [[neopositivism]]. It was influenced by [[Ernst Mach]], [[David Hilbert]], French [[conventionalism]] ([[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Pierre Duhem]]), [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Bertrand Russell]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Albert Einstein]]. The Vienna Circle was pluralistic and committed to the ideals of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. It was unified by the aim of making philosophy scientific with the help of modern [[logic]]. Main topics were foundational debates in the natural and social sciences, logic and mathematics; the modernization of [[empiricism]] by modern logic; the search for an empiricist criterion of meaning; the critique of [[metaphysics]] and the unification of the sciences in the [[unity of science]].&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Stöltzner/Uebel 2006, LII-LXXIX.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vienna Circle appeared in public with the publication of various book series – ''Schriften zur wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung'' (''Monographs on the Scientific World-Conception''), ''Einheitswissenschaft'' (''Unified Science'') and the journal ''[[Erkenntnis]]'' – and the organization of international conferences in [[Prague]]; [[Königsberg]] (today known as [[Kaliningrad]]); [[Paris]]; [[Copenhagen]]; [[Cambridge]], UK, and [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. Its public profile was provided by the ''Ernst Mach Society'' (German: ''Verein Ernst Mach'') through which members of the Vienna Circle sought to popularize their ideas in the context of programmes for national education in Vienna.

During the era of [[Austrofascism]] and after the [[annexation of Austria]] by [[Nazi Germany]] most members of the Vienna Circle were forced to emigrate. The murder of Schlick in 1936 by a former student put an end to the Vienna Circle in Austria.

The Vienna Circle's influence on [[20th-century philosophy]], especially [[philosophy of science]] and [[analytic philosophy]], is immense up to the present day.

==History of the Vienna Circle==
The history and development of the Vienna Circle shows various stages:&lt;ref&gt;Cp. the phases in Stadler 2001. See 579–580 for an overview.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "First Vienna Circle" (1907–1912) ===
The pre-history of the Vienna Circle began with meetings on the [[philosophy of science]] and [[epistemology]] from 1908&lt;ref&gt;Wittgenstein's Vienna, New Edition, Elephant Paperback, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; on, promoted by [[Philipp Frank]], [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]] and [[Otto Neurath]].&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Frank 1949, Stadler 2001, Uebel 2000. The expression goes back to Rudolf Haller, "Der erste Wiener Kreis", in: ''Fragen zu Wittgenstein und Aufsätze zur Österreichischen Philosophie'', Amsterdam 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], the oldest of the three (1879–1934), was a mathematician. He received his degree in [[mathematics]] in 1902. Afterwards he studied under the direction of [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in Vienna and [[David Hilbert]], [[Felix Klein]] and [[Hermann Minkowski]] in [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]]. In 1905 he received the [[Habilitation]] in mathematics. He taught at [[Innsbruck]] (1905–1906) and [[Vienna]] (from 1909).

[[Otto Neurath]] (1882–1945) studied [[mathematics]], [[political economy]], and [[history]] in Vienna and Berlin. From 1907 to 1914 he taught in Vienna at the [[Neue Wiener Handelsakademie]] (Viennese Commercial Academy). Neurath married Olga, Hahn's sister, in 1911.

[[Philipp Frank]], the youngest of the group (1884–1966), studied [[physics]] at Göttingen and Vienna with Ludwig Boltzmann, David Hilbert and Felix Klein. From 1912, he held the chair of [[theoretical physics]] in the [[German University in Prague]].

Their meetings were held in Viennese coffeehouses from 1907 onward. Frank remembered:

{{quotation|After 1910 there began in Vienna a movement which regarded Mach's [[positivist]] philosophy of science as having great importance for general intellectual life [...] An attempt was made by a group of young men to retain the most essential points of Mach's positivism, especially his stand against the misuse of [[metaphysics]] in science. [...] To this group belonged the mathematician H. Hahn, the political economist Otto Neurath, and the author of this book [i.e. Frank], at the time an instructor in [[theoretical physics]] in Vienna. [...] We tried to supplement Mach's ideas by those of the French philosophy of science of [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Pierre Duhem]], and also to connect them with the investigations in [[logic]] of such authors as [[Louis Couturat|Couturat]], [[Ernst Schröder|Schröder]], Hilbert, etc.|Uebel, Thomas, 2003, p. 70.}}

A number of further authors were discussed in the meetings such as [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]], [[Alexius Meinong|Meinong]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz]], [[Heinrich Hertz|Hertz]], [[Husserl]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]], [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]], [[Lenin]] and [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]].&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Stadler 2001, 143–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Presumably the meetings stopped in 1912, when Frank went to [[Prague]], to hold the chair of theoretical physics left vacant by [[Albert Einstein]]. Hahn left Vienna during [[World War I]] and returned in 1921.

=== The formative years (1918–1924) ===
The formation of the Vienna Circle began with Hahn returning to Vienna in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;Stadler 2001, 195–218.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the mathematician [[Kurt Reidemeister]] he organized seminars on [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s ''[[Tractatus logico-philosophicus]]'' and on Whitehead and Russell's ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''.

With the support of Hahn, [[Moritz Schlick]] was appointed to the chair of philosophy of the inductive sciences at the University of Vienna in 1922 – the chair formerly held by [[Ernst Mach]] and partly by [[Boltzmann]]. Schlick had already published two important works ''Raum und Zeit in die gegenwärtigen Physik'' (''Space and Time in contemporary Physics'') in 1917 and ''Allgemeine Erkenntnislehre'' (''General Theory of Knowledge'') in 1918.

Immediately after Schlick's arrival in Vienna, he organized discussions with the mathematicians around Hahn. In 1924 Schlick's students [[Friedrich Waismann]] and [[Herbert Feigl]] suggested to their teacher a sort of regular "evening circle". From winter term 1924 on regular meetings were held at the Institute of Mathematics in Vienna's Boltzmanngasse 5 on personal invitation by Schlick. These discussions can be seen as the beginning of the Vienna Circle.&lt;ref&gt;Stadler 2001, 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The non-public phase of the Vienna Circle – The Schlick Circle (1924–1928) ===
The group that met from 1924 on was quite diverse and included not only recognized scientists such as Schlick, Hahn, Kraft, Philipp Frank, Neurath, [[Olga Hahn-Neurath]], and [[Heinrich Gomperz]], but also younger students and doctoral candidates.&lt;ref&gt;Stadler 2001, 199–218.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the group invited foreign visitors.
 
In 1926 Schlick and Hahn arranged to bring [[Rudolf Carnap]] to the University of Vienna as a ''Privatdozent'' (private lecturer). Carnap's ''Logical Structure of the World'' was intensely discussed in the Circle.

Also Wittgenstein's ''Tractatus logico-philosophicus'' was read out loud and discussed. From 1927 on personal meetings were arranged between Wittgenstein and Schlick, Waismann, Carnap and Feigl.&lt;ref&gt;For the recording of these meetings see Brian McGuinness, ''Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle: Conversations Recorded by Friedrich Waismann.'' Trans. by Joachim Schulte and Brian McGuinness. New York: Barnes &amp; Noble Books, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The public phase – Schlick Circle and ''Verein Ernst Mach'' (1928–1934) ===
In 1928 the ''Verein Ernst Mach'' (''Ernst Mach Society'') was founded, with Schlick as its chairman.&lt;ref&gt;Stadler 2001, 219–290.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the society was the spreading of a "scientific world conception" through public lectures that were in large part held by members of the Vienna Circle.&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of the lectures of the ''Ernst Mach Society'' 1929–1932 see Stadler 2001, 342–344.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 the Vienna Circle made its first public appearance under this name – invented by Neurath&lt;ref&gt;Frank 1949, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; – with the publication of its manifesto ''Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung. Der Wiener Kreis'' (''The Scientific Conception of the World. The Vienna Circle'' also known as ''Viewing the World Scientifically: The Vienna Circle''&lt;ref name="Edmunds, D 2001, page 151"&gt;Edmunds, D. and Eidenow, J. ''Wittgenstein's Poker: The Story of a Ten-Minute Argument Between Two Great Philosophers,'' 2001, page 151.&lt;/ref&gt;) The pamphlet is dedicated to Schlick, and its preface was signed by Hahn, Neurath and Carnap.

The manifesto was presented at the ''Tagung für Erkenntnislehre der exakten Wissenschaften'' (''Conference on the Epistemology of the Exact Sciences'') in autumn 1929, organized by the Vienna Circle together with the [[Berlin Circle]]. This conference was the first international appearance of [[logical empiricism]] and the first of a number of conferences: [[Königsberg]] (1930), [[Prague]] (1934), [[Paris]] (1935), [[Copenhague]] (1936), [[Cambridge]], UK (1938), [[Cambridge, Mass.]] (1939), and [[Chicago]] (1941).

While primarily known for its views on the natural sciences and metaphysics, the public phase of the Vienna Circle was explicitly political. Neurath and Schlick were both [[socialism|socialists]] and believed the rejection of magic was a necessary component for liberation of the working classes. The manifesto linked [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to their political and anti-metaphysical views, indicating a blur between what are now considered two separate schools of contemporary philosophy - [[analytic philosophy]] and [[continental philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |page = 246-7 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 the Vienna Circle and the Berlin Society took over the journal ''Annalen der Philosophie'' and made it the main journal of logical empiricism under the title ''[[Erkenntnis]]'', edited by Carnap and Reichenbach. In addition, the Vienna Circle published a number of book series: ''Schriften zur wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung'' (''Monographs on the Scientific World-Conception'', ed. by Schlick und Frank, 1928–1937),&lt;ref&gt;In 1934 Karl Popper's ''Logic of Scientific Discovery'' was published in this series.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Einheitswissenschaft'' (''Unified Science'', edited by Neurath, 1933–1939), and later the ''[[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]'' (edited by Neurath, Carnap and [[Charles W. Morris]], 1938–1970).

=== Disintegration, emigration, internationalization (1934–1938) ===
Since the beginning of the 1930s first signs of disintegration appeared for political and [[racist]] reasons: [[Herbert Feigl]] left Austria in 1930. Carnap was appointed to a chair at [[Prague University]] in 1931 and left for Chicago in 1935.

1934 marks an important break: Hahn died after surgery, Neurath fled to Holland because of the victory of [[Austrofascism]] in the [[Austrian Civil War]] following which the ''Ernst Mach Society'' was dissolved for political reasons by the [[Schuschnigg]] regime.

The murder of Moritz Schlick by the former student [[Hans Nelböck]] for political and personal reasons in 1936 set an end to the meetings of the Schlick Circle.&lt;ref&gt;For documents concerning the murder of Moritz Schlick and the trial against Nelböck see Stadler 2001, 869–909.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the circle such as Kraft, Waismann, Zilsel, Menger and Gomperz continued to meet occasionally. But the [[annexation of Austria]] to [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938 meant the definite end of the activities of the Vienna Circle in Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Only after the war in 1949 arose the ''[[Kraft Circle]]'' in Vienna, a successor to the Vienna Circle, under the leadership of Viktor Kraft, a former member of the Vienna Circle. Among the members of this circle was [[Paul Feyerabend]].&lt;/ref&gt;

With the emigration went along the internationalization of [[logical empiricism]]. Many former members of the Vienna Circle and the [[Berlin Circle]] emigrated to the [[English-speaking world]] where they had an immense influence on the development of [[philosophy of science]]. The [[unity of science]] movement for the construction of an ''International Encyclopedia of Unified Science'', promoted mainly by Neurath, Carnap, and Morris, is symptomatic of the internationalization of logical empiricism, organizing numerous international conferences and the publication of the ''International Encyclopedia of Unified Science''.&lt;ref&gt;For a chronology of the emigration of the Vienna Circle see Hans-Joachim Dahms, "The Emigration of the Vienna Circle", in: Friedrich Stadler, Peter Weibel (ed.), ''The Cultural Exodus from Austria'', Vienna 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overview of the members of the Vienna Circle ===
Apart from the central figures of the Schlick Circle the question of membership in the Vienna Circle is in many cases unsettled. The partition into "members" and "those sympathetic to the Vienna Circle" produced in the manifesto from 1929 is representative only of a specific moment in the development of the Circle.&lt;ref&gt;Stöltzner and Uebel 2006, XX.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the criteria used (regular attendance, philosophical affinities etc.) there are different possible distributions in "inner circle" and "periphery".

In the following list (in alphabetical order), the "inner circle" is defined using the criterion of regular attendance. The "periphery" comprises occasional visitors, foreign visitors and leading intellectual figures who stood in regular contact with the Circle (such as Wittgenstein and Popper).&lt;ref&gt;Cp. Stadler 2001, 573. This list follows the presentation in Stadler 2001, 571ff., including further bio-bibliographical information on all the persons listed.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inner Circle:''' [[Gustav Bergmann]], [[Rudolf Carnap]], [[Herbert Feigl]], [[Philipp Frank]], [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Hans Hahn (mathematician)|Hans Hahn]], [[Olga Hahn-Neurath]], [[Béla Juhos]], [[Felix Kaufmann]], [[Victor Kraft]], [[Karl Menger]], [[Richard von Mises]], [[Otto Neurath]], [[Rose Rand]], [[Josef Schächter]], [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Friedrich Waismann]], [[Edgar Zilsel]].

'''Periphery:''' [[Alfred Jules Ayer]], [[Egon Brunswik]], [[Karl Bühler]], [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]], [[Else Frenkel-Brunswik]], [[Heinrich Gomperz]], [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], [[Eino Kaila]], [[Hans Kelsen]], [[Charles W. Morris]], [[Arne Næss|Arne Naess]], [[Karl Raimund Popper]], [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], [[Frank P. Ramsey]], [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[Kurt Reidemeister]], [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Olga Taussky-Todd]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

===Reception in the United States and the United Kingdom===
The spread of [[logical positivism]] in the United States occurred throughout the 1920s and 1930s. In 1929 and in 1932, Schlick was a Visiting Professor at [[Stanford University|Stanford]], while Feigl, who immigrated to the United States in 1930, became lecturer (1931) and professor (1933) at the [[University of Iowa]]. The definite diffusion of logical positivism in the United States was due to Carl Hempel, Hans Reichenbach, Rudolf Carnap, Philipp Frank, and Herbert Feigl, who emigrated and taught in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;E. Nagel, "Nature and Convention" in: ''The Journal of Philosophy'', 26, 1929, in which Nagel discussed Reichenbach's interpretation of the theory of relativity;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Hook, "Personal Impression of Contemporary German Philosophy" in: ''The Journal of Philosophy'', 27, 1930, in which Hook presented a favorable report on logical positivism;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.&amp;nbsp;E. Blumberg and H. Feigl, "Logical Positivism: A New Movement in European Philosophy" in: ''The Journal of Philosophy'', 28, 1931.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another link to the United States is [[Willard Van Orman Quine]], who traveled in 1932 and 1933 as a Sheldon Traveling Fellow to [[Vienna]], [[Prague]], and [[Warsaw]]. Moreover, American [[semiotician]] and philosopher [[Charles W. Morris]] helped many German and Austrian philosophers emigrate to the United States, including Rudolf Carnap, in 1936.

In the United Kingdom it was [[Alfred Jules Ayer]] who acquainted the British academia with the work of the Vienna Circle with his book ''[[Language, Truth, and Logic]]'' (1936). [[Karl Popper]] was also important for the reception and critique of their work, even though he never participated in the meetings of the Vienna Circle.

==Topics and debates==
The Vienna Circle cannot be assigned ''one'' single philosophy. First, there existed a plurality of philosophical positions within the Circle, and second, members often changed their views fundamentally in the course of time and in reaction to discussions in the Circle. It thus seems more convenient to speak of "the philosophies (in the plural) of the Vienna Circle".&lt;ref&gt;Cp. [[Thomas Uebel]], "Vienna Circle", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/vienna-circle/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some central topics and debates can be identified.

===The Manifesto (1929)===
This states the scientific world-conception of the Vienna Circle, which is characterized "essentially by two features.&lt;ref&gt;On the historical background of the manifesto see Stadler 2001, 334–339.&lt;/ref&gt; First it is [[empiricism|empiricist]] and positivist: there is knowledge only from experience. Second, the scientific world-conception is marked by the application of a certain method, namely [[logic|logical analysis]]."&lt;ref&gt;''The Scientific Conception of the World. The Vienna Circle'' in Sarkar, Sahotra, 1996, p. 331—hereinafter ''VC''&lt;/ref&gt;

Logical analysis is the method of clarification of philosophical problems; it makes an extensive use of [[symbolic logic]] and distinguishes the Vienna Circle empiricism from earlier versions. The task of philosophy lies in the clarification—through the method of logical analysis—of problems and assertions.

Logical analysis shows that there are two different kinds of statements; one kind includes statements reducible to simpler statements about the empirically given; the other kind includes statements which cannot be reduced to statements about [[experience]] and thus they are devoid of meaning. [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical]] statements belong to this second kind and therefore they are meaningless. Hence many philosophical problems are rejected as pseudo-problems which arise from logical mistakes, while others are re-interpreted as empirical statements and thus become the subject of scientific inquiries.

One source of the logical mistakes that are at the origins of metaphysics is the ambiguity of natural [[language]]. "Ordinary language for instance uses the same [[part of speech]], the substantive, for [[object (philosophy)|thing]]s ('apple') as well as for [[Quality (philosophy)|qualities]] ('hardness'), relations ('friendship'), and processes ('sleep'); therefore it misleads one into a thing-like conception of functional [[concept]]s".&lt;ref&gt;''VC'' p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; Another source of mistakes is "the notion that ''thinking'' can either lead to knowledge out of its own resources without using any empirical material, or at least arrive at new contents by an [[inference]] from given states of affair".&lt;ref&gt;''VC'' p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; [[synthetic proposition|Synthetic knowledge]] a priori is rejected by the Vienna Circle. Mathematics, which at a first sight seems an example of necessarily valid synthetic knowledge derived from pure [[reason]] alone, has instead a [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]] character, that is its statements are [[analytic proposition|analytical statements]], thus very different from Kantian synthetic statements. The only two kinds of statements accepted by the Vienna Circle are synthetic statements ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' (i.e., scientific statements) and analytic statements ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' (i.e., logical and mathematical statements).

However, the persistence of metaphysics is connected not only with logical mistakes but also with "social and economical struggles".&lt;ref name="Vc"&gt;''VC'' p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; Metaphysics and [[theology]] are allied to traditional social forms, while the group of people who "faces modern times, rejects these views and takes its stand on the ground of empirical sciences".&lt;ref name="Vc" /&gt; Thus the struggle between metaphysics and [[science|scientific world-conception]] is not only a struggle between different kinds of philosophies, but it is also—and perhaps primarily—a struggle between different political, social, and economical attitudes. Of course, as the manifesto itself acknowledged, "not every adherent of the scientific world-conception will be a fighter".&lt;ref&gt;VC p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; Many historians of the Vienna Circle see in the latter sentence an implicit reference to a contrast between the so-called 'left wing' of the Vienna Circle, mainly represented by Neurath and Carnap, and Moritz Schlick. The aim of the left wing was to facilitate the penetration of the scientific world-conception in "the forms of personal and public life, in [[education]], upbringing, [[architecture]], and the shaping of economic and social life".&lt;ref&gt;''VC'' p. 339–340&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Schlick was primarily interested in the theoretical study of science and philosophy. Perhaps the sentence "Some, glad of solitude, will lead a withdrawn existence on the icy slopes of logic" is an ironic reference to Schlick.&lt;ref name="Vc" /&gt;

The manifesto lists [[Walter Dubislav]], [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]], [[Kurt Grelling]], Hasso Härlen, [[Eino Kaila]], Heinrich Loewy, [[F.&amp;nbsp;P. Ramsey]], [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[Kurt Reidemeister]], and [[Edgar Zilsel]] as people "sympathetic to the Vienna Circle" and [[Albert Einstein]], [[Bertrand Russell]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] as its "leading representatives".

===Unified science===
{{See also|Unity of science}}
The final goal pursued by the Vienna Circle was [[Unified Science|unified science]], that is the construction of a "constitutive system" in which every legitimate statement is reduced to the concepts of lower level which refer directly to the given [[experience]]. "The endeavour is to link and harmonise the achievements of individual investigators in their various fields of science".&lt;ref&gt;''VC'' p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; From this aim follows the search for clarity, neatness, and for a symbolic language that eliminates the problems arising from the ambiguity of natural language. The Vienna Circle published a collection, called ''Einheitswissenschaft'' (''Unified Science''), edited by Rudolf Carnap, Philipp Frank, Hans Hahn, Otto Neurath, [[Joergen Joergensen]] (after Hahn's death) and [[Charles W. Morris]] (from 1938), whose aim was to present a unified vision of science. After the publication in [[Europe]] of seven monographs from 1933 to 1939, the collection was dismissed, because of the problems arising from the [[World War II]]. In 1938 a new series of publications started in the United States. It was the ''[[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]'', an ambitious project never completed devoted to unified science. Only the first section ''Foundations of the Unity of Sciences'' was published; it contains two volumes for a total of twenty monographs published from 1938 to 1969. As remembered by Rudolf Carnap and Charles Morris in the ''Preface'' to the 1969 edition of the International Encyclopedia of Unified Science:

{{quotation|The ''Encyclopedia'' was in origin the idea of Otto Neurath. It was meant as a manifestation of the unity of science movement [...] Original plans for the Encyclopedia were ambitious. In addition to the two introductory volumes, there was to be a section on the methodology of the sciences, one on the existing state of the unification of sciences, and possibly a section on the application of the sciences. It was planned that the work in its entirety would comprise about twenty-six volumes (260 monographs)|''Foundations of the Unity of Sciences'', vol. 1, The University of Chicago Press, 1969, p. vii.}}

[[Thomas Kuhn]]'s well known work, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', was published in this Encyclopedia in 1962, as the number two in the second volume.

===Critique of metaphysics&lt;!--linked from 'Template:Positivism'--&gt;===
The attitude of Vienna Circle towards metaphysics is well expressed by Carnap in the article 'Überwindung der Metaphysik durch Logische Analyse der Sprache' in ''Erkenntnis'', vol. 2, 1932 (English translation 'The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language' in Sarkar, Sahotra, ed., ''Logical empiricism at its peak: Schlick, Carnap, and Neurath'', New York : Garland Pub., 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;10–31). A language—says Carnap—consists of a [[vocabulary]], i.e., a set of meaningful words, and a [[syntax]], i.e., a set of rules governing the formation of sentences from the words of the vocabulary. Pseudo-statements, i.e., sequences of words that at first sight resemble statements but in reality have no meaning, are formed in two ways: either meaningless words occur in them, or they are formed in an invalid syntactical way. According to Carnap, pseudo-statements of both kinds occur in metaphysics.

A word ''W'' has a meaning if two conditions are satisfied. First, the mode of the occurrence of ''W'' in its elementary sentence form (i.e., the simplest sentence form in which ''W'' is capable of occurring) must be fixed. Secondly, if ''W'' occurs in an elementary sentence ''S'', it is necessary to give an answer to the following questions (that are—according to Carnap—equivalent formulation of the same question):
* What [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s is ''S'' deducible from, and what sentences are deducible from ''S''?
* Under what conditions is ''S'' supposed to be true, and under what conditions false?
* How is ''S'' verified?
* What is the meaning of ''S''?
(Carnap, "The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language" in Sarkar, Sahotra 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;12)

An example offered by Carnap concerns the word '[[arthropod]]'. The sentence form "the thing ''x'' is an arthropod" is an elementary sentence form that is derivable from "''x'' is an animal", "''x'' has a segmented body" and "''x'' has jointed legs". Conversely, these sentences are derivable from "the thing ''x'' is an arthropod". Thus the meaning of the word 'arthropod' is determined.

According to Carnap, many words of metaphysics do not fulfill these requirements and thus they are meaningless. As an example, Carnap considers the word 'principle'. This word has a definite meaning, if the sentence "''x'' is the principle of ''y''" is supposed to be equivalent to the sentence "''y'' exists by virtue of ''x''" or "''y'' arises out of ''x''". The latter sentence is perfectly clear: ''y'' arises out of ''x'' when ''x'' is invariably followed by ''y'', and the invariable association between ''x'' and ''y'' is empirically verifiable. But—says Carnap—metaphysicians are not satisfied with this interpretation of the meaning of 'principle'. They assert that no empirical relation between ''x'' and ''y'' can completely explain the meaning of "''x'' is the principle of ''y''", because there is something that cannot be grasped by means of the experience, something for which no empirical criterion can be specified. It is the lacking of any empirical criterion—says Carnap—that deprives of meaning the word 'principle' when it occurs in metaphysics. Therefore, metaphysical pseudo-statements such as "water is the principle of the world" or "the spirit is the principle of the world" are void of meaning because a meaningless word occurs in them.

However, there are pseudo-statements in which occur only meaningful words; these pseudo-statements are formed in a counter-syntactical way. An example is the word sequence "Caesar is a [[prime number]]"; every word has a definite meaning, but the sequence has no meaning. The problem is that "prime number" is a predicate of numbers, not a predicate of human beings. In the example the nonsense is evident; however, in natural language the rules of grammar do not prohibit the formation of analogous meaningless word sequences that are not so easily detectable. In the grammar of natural languages, every sequence of the kind "''x'' is ''y''", where ''x'' is a noun and ''y'' is a predicate, is acceptable. In fact, in the grammar there is no distinction between predicate which can be affirmed of human beings and predicate which can be affirmed of numbers. So "Caesar is a general" and "Caesar is a prime number" are both well-formed, in contrast for example with "Caesar is and", which is ill-formed. In a logically constructed language—says Carnap—a distinction between the various kinds of predicate is specified, and pseudo-statements as "Caesar is a prime number" are ill-formed. Now, and this is the main point of Carnap's argument, metaphysical statements in which meaningless words do not occur, are indeed meaningless because they are formed in a way which is admissible in natural languages, but not in logically constructed languages. Carnap attempts to indicate the most frequent sources of errors from which metaphysical pseudo-statements can arise. One source of mistakes is the ambiguity of the verb "to be", which is sometimes used as a [[Copula (linguistics)|copula]] ("I am hungry"), and sometimes to designate existence ("I am"). The latter statement incorrectly suggests a predicative form, and thus it suggests that existence is a predicate. Only modern logic, with the introduction of an explicit sign to designate existence (the sign &lt;math&gt;\exists \;&lt;/math&gt;), which occurs only in statements such as &lt;math&gt;\exists \;xP(x)&lt;/math&gt;, never as a predicate, has shown that existence is not a predicate, and thus has revealed the logical error from which pseudo-statements such as "cogito, ergo sum" has arisen.

Another source of mistakes is type confusions, in which a predicate of a kind is used as a predicate of another kind. For example, the pseudo-statements "we know the Nothing" is analogous to "we know the rain", but while the latter is well-formed, the former is ill-formed, at least in a logically constructed language, because "Nothing" is incorrectly used as a [[noun]]. In a formal language, "Nothing" only means &lt;math&gt;\lnot \;\exists \;x&lt;/math&gt;, such as "there is nothing which is outside"—i.e., &lt;math&gt;\lnot \;\exists \;xO(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and thus "Nothing" never occurs as a noun or as a predicate.

According to Carnap, although metaphysics has no theoretical content, it does have content: metaphysical pseudo-statements express the attitude of a person towards life, and this is the role of metaphysics. He compares it to an art like lyrical poetry; the metaphysician works with the medium of the theoretical; he confuses art with science, attitude towards life with knowledge, and thus produces an unsatisfactory and inadequate work. "Metaphysicians are musicians without musical ability".&lt;ref&gt;Carnap, 'The Elimination of Metaphysics', in Sarkar, Sahotra 1996, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Congresses and publications&lt;!--This section is linked from [[International Encyclopedia of Unified Science]]: do not rename without including an anchor to previous name ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;==
{{See also|International Encyclopedia of Unified Science#International Congresses for the Unity of Science}}
The Vienna Circle was very active in advertising their new philosophical ideas. Several congresses on [[epistemology]] and philosophy of science were organized, with the help of the [[Berlin Circle]]. There were some preparatory congresses: Prague (1929), [[Königsberg]] (1930), Prague (1934) and then the first congress on scientific philosophy held in [[Paris]] (1935), followed by congresses in [[Copenhagen]] (1936), Paris (1937), [[Cambridge]], UK (1938), [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. (1939). The Königsberg congress (1930) was very important, for Kurt Gödel announced that he had proven the [[Gödel's completeness theorem|completeness]] of [[first-order logic]] and the [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness]] of formal [[arithmetic]]. Another very interesting congress was the one held in Copenhagen (1936), which was dedicated to [[quantum physics]] and [[causality]].

Between 1928 and 1937, the Vienna Circle published ten books in a collection named ''Schriften zur wissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung'' (''Monographs on the Scientific World-Conception''), edited by Schlick and Frank. [[Karl Raimund Popper]]'s book ''Logik der Forschung'' was published in this collection. Seven works were published in another collection, called ''Einheitswissenschaft'' (''Unified Science''). In 1930 Rudolf Carnap and Hans Reichenbach undertook the editorship of the journal ''Erkenntnis'', which was published between 1930 and 1940 (from 1939 the editors were Otto Neurath, Rudolf Carnap and Charles Morris).

The following is the list of works published in the two collections edited by the Vienna Circle.

==Institute Vienna Circle==
In 1991 the [[Institute Vienna Circle]] was established in Vienna. It is dedicated to studying the work and influence of the Vienna Circle. In 2011 it was integrated in the [[University of Vienna]] as a subunit of the Faculty of Philosophy and Education. In 2015 the Institute co-organized an exhibition on the Vienna Circle in the main building of the University of Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.univie.ac.at/exhibitionViennaCircle/exhibitionViennaCircle/exhibition.html|title=Exhibition|website=www.univie.ac.at|language=de-DE|access-date=2017-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Who Were the Early Israelites and Where Did They Come From?''''' is a book by American biblical scholar and archaeologist [[William G. Dever]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dever|first=William G.|authorlink=William G. Dever|title=Who were the early Israelites, and where did they come from?|year=2003|publisher=Eerdmans|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|isbn=0-8028-0975-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dever has been prominent in the debate between biblical "maximalists" and "[[Minimalism (Biblical archaeology)|minimalists]]" over the [[historicity of the Bible]] (specifically the [[Old Testament]]). This book, which coincided with Dever's retirement from the [[University of Arizona]], where he served as professor of [[Near Eastern Archaeology]] and Anthropology for many years, was written on a semi-popular level to explain the background and origin of the people Dever describes as the "protoIsraelites."&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hawkins, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0LAL/is_3_33/ai_107759382/  Review of "Who Were the Early Israelites"],{{dead link|date=August 2016}} ''Biblical Theological Bulletin'', Fall 2003&lt;/ref&gt; It followed an earlier book, ''[[What Did the Biblical Writers Know and When Did They Know It?]]'', in which Dever, contrary to the "minimalists", asserted that the writers of the Old Testament knew a good deal about the [[Israelites]]' past.&lt;ref&gt;John Barclay Burns, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0LAL/is_1_34/ai_n6147831   review of ''Who Were the Early Israelites?''],{{dead link|date=August 2016}} ''Biblical Theological Bulletin'', Spring 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wound healing''' is a complex process in which the skin, and the tissues under it, repair themselves after injury.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Nguyen DT, Orgill DP, Murphy GT |title=Biomaterials for Treating Skin Loss|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-6yjAgAAQBAJ|page=25}}|date=2009|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-1-84569-554-5|pages=25–57. Orgill DP, Blanco C (editors)|chapter=4 The Pathophysiologic Basis for Wound Healing and Cutaneous Regeneration}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this article, wound healing is depicted in a discrete timeline of physical attributes (phases) constituting the post-trauma repairing process. In undamaged skin, the [[epidermis]] (surface layer) and [[dermis]] (deeper layer) form a protective barrier against the external environment. When the barrier is broken, a regulated sequence of biochemical events is set into motion to repair the damage.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rieger"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rieger S, Zhao H, Martin P, Abe K, Lisse TS | title = The role of nuclear hormone receptors in cutaneous wound repair | journal = Cell Biochemistry and Function | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–13 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25529612 | pmc = 4357276 | doi = 10.1002/cbf.3086 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is divided into predictable phases: blood clotting ([[hemostasis]]), [[inflammation]], tissue growth (proliferation), and tissue remodeling (maturation). Blood clotting may be considered to be part of the inflammation stage instead of a separate stage.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stadelmann WK, Digenis AG, Tobin GR | title = Physiology and healing dynamics of chronic cutaneous wounds | journal = American Journal of Surgery | volume = 176 | issue = 2A Suppl | pages = 26S-38S | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9777970 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9610(98)00183-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Wound Healing.jpg|thumb|Deep wound on shin with stitches healing over five weeks]]

The wound healing process is not only complex but also fragile, and it is susceptible to interruption or failure leading to the formation of non-healing [[chronic wound]]s. Factors that contribute to non-healing chronic wounds are diabetes, venous or arterial disease, infection, and metabolic deficiencies of old age.&lt;ref name="Enoch"&gt;Enoch, S. Price, P. (2004). [http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2004/august/Enoch/Pathophysiology-Of-Healing.html ''Cellular, molecular and biochemical differences in the pathophysiology of healing between acute wounds, chronic wounds and wounds in the elderly''].&lt;/ref&gt;

Wound care encourages and speeds wound healing via cleaning and protection from reinjury or infection. Depending on each patient's needs, it can range from the simplest [[first aid]] to entire nursing specialties such as [[wound, ostomy, and continence nursing]] and [[burn center]] care.

==Stages==
* [[Hemostasis]] (blood clotting): Within the first few minutes of injury, [[platelets]] in the blood begin to stick to the injured site. This activates the platelets, causing a few things to happen. They change into an amorphous shape, more suitable for clotting, and they release chemical signals to promote clotting. This results in the activation of [[fibrin]], which forms a mesh and acts as "glue" to bind platelets to each other. This makes a [[thrombus|clot]] that serves to plug the break in the blood vessel, slowing/preventing further bleeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Rasche H |title=Haemostasis and thrombosis: an overview|journal=European Heart Journal Supplements|date=2001|volume=3|issue=Supplement Q|pages=Q3–Q7|doi=10.1016/S1520-765X(01)90034-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Versteeg HH, Heemskerk JW, Levi M, Reitsma PH | title = New fundamentals in hemostasis | journal = Physiological Reviews | volume = 93 | issue = 1 | pages = 327–58 | date = January 2013 | pmid = 23303912 | doi = 10.1152/physrev.00016.2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Inflammation: During this phase, damaged and dead cells are cleared out, along with bacteria and other pathogens or debris. This happens through the process of [[phagocytosis]], where white blood cells "eat" debris by engulfing it. [[Platelet-derived growth factor]]s are released into the wound that cause the migration and division of cells during the proliferative phase.
* Proliferation (growth of new tissue): In this phase, [[angiogenesis]], [[collagen]] deposition, [[granulation tissue]] formation, epithelialization, and wound contraction occur.&lt;ref name="Midwood"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Midwood KS, Williams LV, Schwarzbauer JE | title = Tissue repair and the dynamics of the extracellular matrix | journal = The International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 1031–7 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15094118 | doi = 10.1016/j.biocel.2003.12.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In angiogenesis, vascular endothelial cells form new blood vessels.&lt;ref name="chang"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chang HY, Sneddon JB, Alizadeh AA, Sood R, West RB, Montgomery K, Chi JT, van de Rijn M, Botstein D, Brown PO | title = Gene expression signature of fibroblast serum response predicts human cancer progression: similarities between tumors and wounds | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = E7 | date = February 2004 | pmid = 14737219 | pmc = 314300 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020007 | displayauthors = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fibroplasia and granulation tissue formation, [[fibroblast]]s grow and form a new, provisional [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) by excreting collagen and [[fibronectin]].&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt;  Concurrently, re-epithelialization of the epidermis occurs, in which [[epithelial cell]]s proliferate and 'crawl' atop the wound bed, providing cover for the new tissue.&lt;ref name="Garg"&gt;Garg, H.G. (2000).  ''Scarless Wound Healing''.  New York Marcel Dekker, Inc. Electronic book.&lt;/ref&gt; In wound contraction, [[myofibroblast]]s decrease the size of the wound by gripping the wound edges and contracting using a mechanism that resembles that in smooth muscle cells. When the cells' roles are close to complete, unneeded cells undergo [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt;
* Maturation (remodeling): During maturation and remodeling, collagen is realigned along tension lines, and cells that are no longer needed are removed by programmed cell death, or [[apoptosis]].

==Timing and reepithelialization==
Timing is important to wound healing. Critically, the timing of wound reepithelialization can decide the outcome of the healing.&lt;ref name=Cubison2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cubison TC, Pape SA, Parkhouse N | title = Evidence for the link between healing time and the development of hypertrophic scars (HTS) in paediatric burns due to scald injury | journal = Burns | volume = 32 | issue = 8 | pages = 992–9 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 16901651 | doi = 10.1016/j.burns.2006.02.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the epithelization of tissue over a denuded area is slow, a scar will form over many weeks, or months;&lt;ref name=Kraftlynde&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Kraft J, Lynde C,| title = Giving Burns the First, Second and Third Degree - Classification of burns | quote =  Formation of a thick eschar, slow healing (&gt;1month), Obvious scarring, | publisher = skincareguide.ca | url = http://www.skincareguide.ca/articles/general_skin_care/gen_skin_care_art_3.html | access-date = 31 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bursurg201406/&gt; If the epithelization of a wounded area is fast, the healing will result in regeneration.&lt;ref name=bursurg201406&gt;{{Cite web  | title = POST BURN SCAR RELATIVE TO RE-EPITHELIALIZATION  | publisher = Burnsurgery.org | year = 2011 | url = http://www.burnsurgery.com/Modules/BurnWound%201/sect_IX.htm| quote = Healing in 2 weeks – minimal to no scar; Healing in 3 weeks – minimal to no scar except in high risk scar formers;Healing in 4 weeks or more – hypertrophic in more than 50% of patients| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425052018/http://www.burnsurgery.com/Modules/BurnWound%201/sect_IX.htm | archive-date = 25 April 2014 | access-date = 16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early vs cellular phase==
[[Image:Fluorescent wound healing.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A [[Fluorescence microscope|fluorescence micrograph]] of cells in ''[[Drosophila]]'' larvae healing after a puncture wound. The arrow points to cells that have fused to form [[syncytia]], and the arrowheads point to cells that are oriented to face the wound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Galko MJ, Krasnow MA | title = Cellular and genetic analysis of wound healing in Drosophila larvae | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 8 | pages = E239 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15269788 | pmc = 479041 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0020239 | url = http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020239 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Wound healing is classically divided into hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. Although a useful construct, this model employs considerable overlapping among individual phases. A complementary model has recently been described&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt; where the many elements of wound healing are more clearly delineated. The importance of this new model becomes more apparent through its utility in the fields of [[regenerative medicine]] and [[tissue engineering]] (see Research and development section below). In this construct, the process of wound healing is divided into two major phases: the ''early phase'' and the ''cellular phase'':&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt;

The early phase, which begins immediately following skin injury, involves cascading molecular and cellular events leading to hemostasis and formation of an early, makeshift extracellular matrix that provides structural [[scaffolding|staging]] for cellular attachment and subsequent cellular proliferation.

The cellular phase involves several types of cells working together to mount an inflammatory response, synthesize granulation tissue, and restore the epithelial layer.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt; Subdivisions of the cellular phase are:  [1] [[Macrophage]]s and inflammatory components (within 1–2 days), [2] [[Epithelial]]-[[mesenchymal]] interaction: re-epithelialization ([[phenotype]] change within hours, migration begins on day 1 or 2), [3] [[Fibroblasts]] and [[myofibroblasts]]: progressive alignment, collagen production, and matrix contraction (between day 4 and day 14), [4] [[Endothelial cell]]s and angiogenesis (begins on day 4), [5] Dermal matrix: elements of fabrication (begins on day 4, lasting 2 weeks) and alteration/remodeling (begins after week 2, lasting weeks to months—depending on wound size).&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt;

== Inflammatory phase ==
Just before the inflammatory phase is initiated, the [[clotting cascade|clotting]] cascade occurs in order to achieve [[hemostasis]], or stop blood loss by way of a fibrin clot. Thereafter, various soluble factors (including chemokines and cytokines) are released to attract [[cell (biology)|cells]] that [[phagocytosis|phagocytise]] debris, bacteria, and damaged tissue, in addition to releasing signaling molecules that initiate the proliferative phase of wound healing.

===Clotting cascade===
{{Main|Coagulation}}

When [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] is first wounded, [[blood]] comes in contact with [[collagen]], triggering blood [[platelet]]s to begin secreting inflammatory factors.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg and de la Torre, 2006"&gt;Rosenberg L., de la Torre J. (2006). [http://www.emedicine.com/plastic/topic457.htm Wound Healing, Growth Factors].  Emedicine.com. Accessed January 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Platelets also express sticky [[glycoprotein]]s on their [[cell membrane]]s that allow them to [[platelet aggregation|aggregate]], forming a mass.&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt;

[[Fibrin]] and [[fibronectin]] cross-link together and form a plug that traps [[protein]]s and particles and prevents further blood loss.&lt;ref name="Sandeman"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sandeman SR, Allen MC, Liu C, Faragher RG, Lloyd AW | title = Human keratocyte migration into collagen gels declines with in vitro ageing | journal = Mechanisms of Ageing and Development | volume = 119 | issue = 3 | pages = 149–57 | date = November 2000 | pmid = 11080534 | doi = 10.1016/S0047-6374(00)00177-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This fibrin-fibronectin plug is also the main structural support for the wound until collagen is deposited.&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt; Migratory cells use this plug as a matrix to crawl across, and platelets adhere to it and secrete factors.&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt; The clot is eventually lysed and replaced with [[granulation tissue]] and then later with collagen.

Platelets, the cells present in the highest numbers shortly after a wound occurs, release mediators into the blood, including [[cytokine]]s and [[growth factor]]s.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg and de la Torre, 2006"/&gt;  Growth factors stimulate cells to speed their rate of division. Platelets release other proinflammatory factors like [[serotonin]], [[bradykinin]], [[prostaglandin]]s, [[prostacyclin]]s, [[thromboxane]], and [[histamine]],&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; which serve several purposes, including increasing cell proliferation and migration to the area and causing [[blood vessel]]s to become dilated and [[porous]]. In many ways, extravasated platelets in trauma perform a similar function to tissue [[macrophage]]s and [[mast cell]]s exposed to [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|microbial molecular signature]]s in [[infection]]: they become activated, and secrete molecular mediators – vasoactive amines, [[eicosanoid]]s, and [[cytokine]]s  – that initiate the [[inflammation|inflammatory]] process.

===Vasoconstriction and vasodilation===
Immediately after a [[blood vessel]] is breached, ruptured [[cell membrane]]s release inflammatory factors like [[thromboxane]]s and [[prostaglandin]]s that cause the vessel to spasm to prevent blood loss and to collect inflammatory cells and factors in the area.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; This [[vasoconstriction]] lasts five to ten minutes and is followed by [[vasodilation]], a widening of blood vessels, which peaks at about 20 minutes post-wounding.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; Vasodilation is the end result of factors released by platelets and other cells. The main factor involved in causing vasodilation is [[histamine]].&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenberg and de la Torre, 2006"/&gt; Histamine also causes blood vessels to become porous, allowing the tissue to become [[edema]]tous because proteins from the bloodstream leak into the extravascular space, which increases its osmolar load and draws water into the area.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; Increased [[porosity]] of blood vessels also facilitates the entry of inflammatory cells like [[leukocyte]]s into the wound site from the [[bloodstream]].&lt;ref name="Dealey"&gt;Dealey C. (1999). ''The care of wounds: A guide for nurses''.  Oxford ; Malden, Mass. Blackwell Science.  Electronic book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Theoret"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1053/j.ctep.2004.08.009 | vauthors = Theoret CL | year = 2004 | title = Update on wound repair | url = | journal = Clinical Techniques in Equine Practice | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 110–122 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polymorphonuclear neutrophils===
Within an hour of wounding, [[granulocyte|polymorphonuclear neutrophil]]s (PMNs) arrive at the wound site and become the predominant cells in the wound for the first two days after the injury occurs, with especially high numbers on the second day.&lt;ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"&gt;de la Torre J., Sholar A.  (2006). [http://www.emedicine.com/plastic/topic477.htm Wound healing: Chronic wounds].  Emedicine.com.  Accessed January 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; They are attracted to the site by fibronectin, growth factors, and substances such as [[kinin]]s. Neutrophils phagocytise debris and kill bacteria by releasing [[free radical]]s in what is called a '[[respiratory burst]].&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greenhalgh DG | title = The role of apoptosis in wound healing | journal = The International Journal of Biochemistry &amp; Cell Biology | volume = 30 | issue = 9 | pages = 1019–30 | date = September 1998 | pmid = 9785465 | doi = 10.1016/S1357-2725(98)00058-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="muller"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muller MJ, Hollyoak MA, Moaveni Z, Brown TL, Herndon DN, Heggers JP | title = Retardation of wound healing by silver sulfadiazine is reversed by Aloe vera and nystatin | journal = Burns | volume = 29 | issue = 8 | pages = 834–6 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14636760 | doi = 10.1016/S0305-4179(03)00198-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They also cleanse the wound by secreting [[protease]]s that break down damaged tissue. Functional neutrophils at the wound site only have life-spans of around 2 days, so they usually undergo apoptosis once they have completed their tasks and are engulfed and degraded by [[macrophage]]s.&lt;ref name="Martin"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Martin P, Leibovich SJ | title = Inflammatory cells during wound repair: the good, the bad and the ugly | journal = Trends in Cell Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | pages = 599–607 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16202600 | doi = 10.1016/j.tcb.2005.09.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other leukocytes to enter the area include [[helper T cell]]s, which secrete [[cytokines]] to cause more T cells to divide and to increase inflammation and enhance vasodilation and vessel permeability.&lt;ref name="Dealey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Santoro"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Santoro MM, Gaudino G | title = Cellular and molecular facets of keratinocyte reepithelization during wound healing | journal = Experimental Cell Research | volume = 304 | issue = 1 | pages = 274–86 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15707592 | doi = 10.1016/j.yexcr.2004.10.033 }}&lt;/ref&gt; T cells also increase the activity of macrophages.&lt;ref name="Dealey"/&gt;

===Macrophages===
One of the macrophage's roles is to phagocytize other expended [[phagocyte]]s,&lt;ref name="Expert Reviews"/&gt; bacteria and damaged tissue,&lt;ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/&gt; and they also debride damaged tissue by releasing proteases.&lt;ref name="Deodhar and Rana"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deodhar AK, Rana RE | title = Surgical physiology of wound healing: a review | journal = Journal of Postgraduate Medicine | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 52–6 | year = 1997 | pmid = 10740722 | url = http://www.jpgmonline.com/article.asp?issn=0022-3859;year=1997;volume=43;issue=2;spage=52;epage=6;aulast=Deodhar }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decline of inflammatory phase===
As inflammation dies down, fewer inflammatory factors are secreted, existing ones are broken down, and numbers of neutrophils and macrophages are reduced at the wound site.&lt;ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/&gt;  These changes indicate that the inflammatory phase is ending and the proliferative phase is underway.&lt;ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/&gt; In vitro evidence, obtained using the [[dermal equivalent]] model, suggests that the presence of macrophages actually delays wound contraction and thus the disappearance of macrophages from the wound may be essential for subsequent phases to occur.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Newton PM, Watson JA, Wolowacz RG, Wood EJ | title = Macrophages restrain contraction of an in vitro wound healing model | journal = Inflammation | volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 207–14 | date = August 2004 | pmid = 15673162 | doi = 10.1023/B:IFLA.0000049045.41784.59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because inflammation plays roles in fighting infection, clearing debris and inducing the proliferation phase, it is a necessary part of healing. However, inflammation can lead to [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] damage if it lasts too long.&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt; Thus the reduction of inflammation is frequently a goal in therapeutic settings. Inflammation lasts as long as there is debris in the wound. Thus, if the individual's immune system is compromised and is unable to clear the debris from the wound and/or if excessive detritus, devitalized tissue, or microbial [[biofilm]] is present in the wound, these factors may cause a prolonged inflammatory phase and prevent the wound from properly commencing the proliferation phase of healing. This can lead to a [[chronic wound]].

== Proliferative phase ==

About two or three days after the wound occurs, [[fibroblasts]] begin to enter the wound site, marking the onset of the proliferative phase even before the inflammatory phase has ended.&lt;ref name="Falanga, 2005"&gt;Falanga V.  (2005). Wound Healing.  American Academy of Dermatology (AAD).&lt;/ref&gt; As in the other phases of wound healing, steps in the proliferative phase do not occur in a series but rather partially overlap in time.

===Angiogenesis===
{{Further|Angiogenesis}}
Also called neovascularization, the process of angiogenesis occurs concurrently with fibroblast proliferation when endothelial cells migrate to the area of the wound.&lt;ref name="Kuwahara"&gt;Kuwahara R.T. and Rasberry R.  2007.  [http://www.emedicine.com/derm/topic533.htm Chemical Peels]. Emedicine.com.  Accessed September 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the activity of fibroblasts and epithelial cells requires oxygen and nutrients, angiogenesis is imperative for other stages in wound healing, like epidermal and fibroblast migration. The tissue in which angiogenesis has occurred typically looks red (is [[erythema]]tous) due to the presence of [[capillary|capillaries]].&lt;ref name="Kuwahara"/&gt;

Angiogenesis occurs in overlapping phases in response to inflammation:
#'''Latent period:''' During the haemostatic and inflammatory phase of the wound healing process, vasodilation and permeabilisation allow leukocyte extravasation and phagocytic debridement and decontamination of the wound area. Tissue swelling aids later angiogenesis by expanding and loosening the existing collagenous extracellular matrix.
#'''Endothelial activation''': As the wound macrophages switches from inflammatory to healing mode, it begins to secrete endothelial chemotactic and growth factors to attract adjacent endothelial cells. Activated endothelial cells respond by retracting and reducing cell junctions, loosening themselves from their embedded endothelium. Characteristically the activated endothelial cells show enlarged nucleoli.
#'''Degradation of endothelial basement membrane''': The wound macrophages, mast cells and the endothelial cells themselves secrete proteases to break down existing vascular basal lamina.
#'''Vascular sprouting''': With the breakdown of endothelial basement membrane, detached endothelial cells from pre-existing capillaries and post-capillary venules can divide and migrate chemotactically towards the wound, laying down new vessels in the process. Vascular sprouting can be aided by ambient hypoxia and acidosis in the wound environment, as hypoxia stimulates the endothelial transcription factor, hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) to transactivate angiogenic genes such as VEGF and GLUT1. Sprouted vessels can self-organise into luminal morphologies, and fusion of blind channels give rise to new capillary networks.
#'''Vascular maturation''': the endothelium of vessels mature by laying down new endothelial extracellular matrix, followed by basal lamina formation. Lastly the vessel establishes a pericyte layer.

[[Stem cell]]s of [[endothelial cell]]s, originating from parts of uninjured blood vessels, develop [[pseudopod]]ia and push through the [[Extracellular matrix|ECM]] into the wound site to establish new blood vessels.&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt;

[[Endothelial cell]]s are attracted to the wound area by fibronectin found on the fibrin scab and [[chemotaxis|chemotactically]] by angiogenic factors released by other cells,&lt;ref name="romo"&gt;Romo T. and Pearson J.M. 2005.  [http://www.emedicine.com/ent/topic13.htm Wound Healing, Skin].  Emedicine.com. Accessed December 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. from macrophages and platelets when in a low-oxygen environment. Endothelial growth and proliferation is also directly stimulated by [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]], and presence of [[lactic acid]] in the wound.&lt;ref name="Falanga, 2005"/&gt; For example, hypoxia stimulates the endothelial [[transcription factor]], [[hypoxia-inducible factor]] (HIF) to [[transactivate]] a set of proliferative genes including [[vascular endothelial growth factor]] (VEGF) and [[GLUT1|glucose transporter 1]] (GLUT1).

To migrate, endothelial cells need [[collagenase]]s and [[plasminogen activator]] to degrade the clot and part of the ECM.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/&gt; [[Zinc]]-dependent [[metalloproteinase]]s digest [[basement membrane]] and ECM to allow cell migration, proliferation and angiogenesis.&lt;ref name="Lansdown"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lansdown AB, Sampson B, Rowe A | title = Experimental observations in the rat on the influence of cadmium on skin wound repair | journal = International Journal of Experimental Pathology | volume = 82 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–41 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11422539 | pmc = 2517695 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2613.2001.00180.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When macrophages and other growth factor-producing cells are no longer in a hypoxic, lactic acid-filled environment, they stop producing angiogenic factors.&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt; Thus, when tissue is adequately [[perfusion|perfused]], migration and proliferation of endothelial cells is reduced. Eventually blood vessels that are no longer needed die by [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt;

===Fibroplasia and granulation tissue formation===
Simultaneously with angiogenesis, [[fibroblast]]s begin accumulating in the wound site. Fibroblasts begin entering the wound site two to five days after wounding as the inflammatory phase is ending, and their numbers peak at one to two weeks post-wounding.&lt;ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/&gt; By the end of the first week, fibroblasts are the main cells in the wound.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; Fibroplasia ends two to four weeks after wounding.

As a model the mechanism of fibroplasia may be conceptualised as an analogous process to angiogenesis (see above) - only the cell type involved is fibroblasts rather than endothelial cells. Initially there is a latent phase where the wound undergoes plasma exudation, inflammatory decontamination and debridement. Oedema increases the wound histologic accessibility for later fibroplastic migration. Second, as inflammation nears completion, macrophage and mast cells release fibroblast growth and chemotactic factors to activate fibroblasts from adjacent tissue. Fibroblasts at this stage loosen themselves from surrounding cells and ECM. Phagocytes further release proteases that break down the ECM of neighbouring tissue, freeing the activated fibroblasts to proliferate and migrate towards the wound. The difference between vascular sprouting and fibroblast proliferation is that the former is enhanced by hypoxia, whilst the latter is inhibited by hypoxia. The deposited fibroblastic connective tissue matures by secreting ECM into the extracellular space, forming granulation tissue (see below). Lastly collagen is deposited into the ECM.

In the first two or three days after injury, fibroblasts mainly migrate and proliferate, while later, they are the main cells that lay down the collagen matrix in the wound site.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; Origins of these fibroblasts are thought to be from the adjacent uninjured cutaneous tissue (although new evidence suggests that some are derived from blood-borne, circulating adult stem cells/precursors).&lt;ref name="G Song, DT Nguyen, et al."/&gt; Initially fibroblasts utilize the fibrin cross-linking fibers (well-formed by the end of the inflammatory phase) to migrate across the wound, subsequently adhering to fibronectin.&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt;   Fibroblasts then deposit [[ground substance]] into the wound bed, and later collagen, which they can adhere to for migration.&lt;ref name="Rosenberg and de la Torre, 2006"/&gt;

[[Granulation tissue]] functions as rudimentary tissue, and begins to appear in the wound already during the inflammatory phase, two to five days post wounding, and continues growing until the wound bed is covered.  Granulation tissue consists of new blood vessels, fibroblasts, inflammatory cells, endothelial cells, myofibroblasts, and the components of a new, provisional [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM). The provisional ECM is different in composition from the ECM in normal tissue and its components originate from fibroblasts.&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt; Such components include fibronectin, collagen, [[glycosaminoglycan]]s, [[elastin]], [[glycoprotein]]s and [[proteoglycan]]s.&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt; Its main components are fibronectin and [[hyaluronan]], which create a very hydrated matrix and facilitate cell migration.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt; Later this provisional matrix is replaced with an ECM that more closely resembles that found in non-injured tissue.

Growth factors ([[PDGF]], [[TGF-β]]) and fibronectin encourage proliferation, migration to the wound bed, and production of ECM molecules by fibroblasts. Fibroblasts also secrete growth factors that attract epithelial cells to the wound site.  Hypoxia also contributes to fibroblast proliferation and excretion of growth factors, though too little oxygen will inhibit their growth and deposition of ECM components, and can lead to excessive, fibrotic [[scar|scarring.]]

====Collagen deposition====
One of fibroblasts' most important duties is the production of [[collagen]].&lt;ref name="Kuwahara"/&gt;

Collagen deposition is important because it increases the strength of the wound; before it is laid down, the only thing holding the wound closed is the fibrin-fibronectin clot, which does not provide much resistance to [[traumatic injury]].&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt; Also, cells involved in inflammation, angiogenesis, and connective tissue construction attach to, grow and differentiate on the collagen matrix laid down by fibroblasts.&lt;ref name="Ruszczak"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ruszczak Z | title = Effect of collagen matrices on dermal wound healing | journal = Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews | volume = 55 | issue = 12 | pages = 1595–611 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14623403 | doi = 10.1016/j.addr.2003.08.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Type III collagen]] and [[fibronectin]] generally begin to be produced in appreciable amounts at somewhere between approximately 10 hours&lt;ref name=pollock&gt;Fig. 9-1. The cellular, biochemical, and mechanical phases of wound healing. {{cite book | last1 = Pollock | first1 = Raphael E. | first2 = F.

Their deposition peaks at one to three weeks.&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt; They are the predominating tensile substances until the later phase of maturation, in which they are replaced by the stronger [[type I collagen]].

Even as fibroblasts are producing new collagen, collagenases and other factors degrade it. Shortly after wounding, synthesis exceeds degradation so collagen levels in the wound rise, but later production and degradation become equal so there is no net collagen gain.&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt; This homeostasis signals the onset of the later maturation phase. Granulation gradually ceases and fibroblasts decrease in number in the wound once their work is done.&lt;ref name="DiPietro"&gt;{{cite book | veditors = DiPietro LA, Burns AL | date = 2003 | title =  Wound Healing: Methods and Protocols.  |series = Methods in Molecular Medicine | location = Totowa, N.J. | publisher = Humana Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the granulation phase, fibroblasts begin to commit apoptosis, converting granulation tissue from an environment rich in cells to one that consists mainly of collagen.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt;

===Epithelialization===
The formation of granulation tissue into an open wound allows the reepithelialization phase to take place, as epithelial cells migrate across the new tissue to form a barrier between the wound and the environment.&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt; [[Stratum basale|Basal]] [[keratinocyte]]s from the wound edges and [[dermal appendage]]s such as [[hair follicle]]s, [[sweat glands]] and [[Sebaceous gland|sebacious (oil) glands]] are the main cells responsible for the epithelialization phase of wound healing.&lt;ref name="DiPietro"/&gt; They advance in a sheet across the wound site and proliferate at its edges, ceasing movement when they meet in the middle. In healing that results in a scar, sweat glands, hair follicles&lt;ref name="sweatgland"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fu XB, Sun TZ, Li XK, Sheng ZY | title = Morphological and distribution characteristics of sweat glands in hypertrophic scar and their possible effects on sweat gland regeneration | journal = Chinese Medical Journal | volume = 118 | issue = 3 | pages = 186–91 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15740645 | url = http://www.cmj.org/Periodical/LinkIn.asp?journal=Chinese%20Medical%20Journal&amp;linkintype=pubmed&amp;year=2005&amp;vol=118&amp;issue=3&amp;beginpage=186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=follicles2014/&gt; and nerves do not form.

[[Keratinocyte]]s migrate without first proliferating.&lt;ref name="Bartkova"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bartkova J, Grøn B, Dabelsteen E, Bartek J | title = Cell-cycle regulatory proteins in human wound healing | journal = Archives of Oral Biology | volume = 48 | issue = 2 | pages = 125–32 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12642231 | doi = 10.1016/S0003-9969(02)00202-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Migration can begin as early as a few hours after wounding. However, epithelial cells require viable tissue to migrate across, so if the wound is deep it must first be filled with granulation tissue.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney"&gt;Mulvaney M. and Harrington A.  1994.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20031218072356/http://www.vnh.org/MilitaryDerm/Ch7.pdf Chapter 7: Cutaneous trauma and its treatment].  In, ''Textbook of Military Medicine: Military Dermatology''.  Office of the Surgeon General, Department of the Army.  Virtual Naval Hospital Project. Accessed through web archive on September 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the time of onset of migration is variable and may occur about one day after wounding.&lt;ref name="larjava"&gt;Larjava H., Koivisto L., and Hakkinen L. 2002.

Georgetown, Tex., Austin, Tex Landes Bioscience, Inc. Electronic book.&lt;/ref&gt; Cells on the wound margins proliferate on the second and third day post-wounding in order to provide more cells for migration.&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt;

If the [[basement membrane]] is not breached, epithelial cells are replaced within three days by division and upward migration of cells in the [[stratum basale]] in the same fashion that occurs in uninjured skin.&lt;ref name="romo"/&gt; However, if the basement membrane is ruined at the wound site, reepithelization must occur from the wound margins and from skin appendages such as hair follicles and sweat and oil glands that enter the [[dermis]] that are lined with viable keratinocytes.&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt; If the wound is very deep, skin appendages may also be ruined and migration can only occur from wound edges.&lt;ref name="Mulvaney"/&gt;

Migration of keratinocytes over the wound site is stimulated by lack of [[contact inhibition]] and by chemicals such as [[nitric oxide]].&lt;ref name="Witte and Barbul"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Witte MB, Barbul A | title = Role of nitric oxide in wound repair | journal = American Journal of Surgery | volume = 183 | issue = 4 | pages = 406–12 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11975928 | doi = 10.1016/S0002-9610(02)00815-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before they begin to migrate, cells must dissolve their [[desmosomes]] and [[hemidesmosomes]], which normally anchor the cells by [[intermediate filaments]] in their [[cytoskeleton]] to other cells and to the ECM.&lt;ref name="Santoro"/&gt;  [[Transmembrane]]  [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] [[protein]]s called [[integrin]]s, which are made of [[glycoprotein]]s and normally anchor the cell to the basement membrane by its [[cytoskeleton]], are released from the cell's intermediate filaments and relocate to [[actin]] filaments to serve as attachments to the ECM for [[pseudopod]]ia during migration.&lt;ref name="Santoro"/&gt; Thus keratinocytes detach from the basement membrane and are able to enter the wound bed.&lt;ref name="Falanga, 2005"/&gt;

Before they begin migrating, keratinocytes change shape, becoming longer and flatter and extending cellular processes like [[pseudopod|lamellipodia]] and wide processes that look like ruffles.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt;  [[Actin]] filaments and [[pseudopod]]ia form.&lt;ref name="Falanga, 2005"/&gt; During migration, [[integrin]]s on the pseudopod attach to the ECM, and the actin filaments in the projection pull the cell along.&lt;ref name="Santoro"/&gt; The interaction with molecules in the ECM through integrins further promotes the formation of actin filaments, lamellipodia, and [[pseudopod|filopodia]].&lt;ref name="Santoro"/&gt;

Epithelial cells climb over one another in order to migrate.&lt;ref name="DiPietro"/&gt; This growing sheet of epithelial cells is often called the epithelial tongue.&lt;ref name="Bartkova"/&gt; The first cells to attach to the [[basement membrane]] form the [[stratum basale]]. These basal cells continue to migrate across the wound bed, and epithelial cells above them slide along as well.&lt;ref name="Bartkova"/&gt; The more quickly this migration occurs, the less of a scar there will be.&lt;ref name="Son"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.cap.2005.01.011 |title=Effects of β-glucan on proliferation and migration of fibroblasts |year=2005 |last1=Son |first1=Hyun Joo |last2=Bae |first2=Hyun Chul |last3=Kim |first3=Hyun Jeong |last4=Lee |first4=Dong Hee |last5=Han |first5=Dong-Wook |last6=Park |first6=Jong-Chul | name-list-format = vanc |journal=Current Applied Physics |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=468–71 |bibcode=2005CAP.....5..468S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fibrin]], collagen, and fibronectin in the ECM may further signal cells to divide and migrate.  Like fibroblasts, migrating keratinocytes use the fibronectin cross-linked with fibrin that was deposited in inflammation as an attachment site to crawl across.&lt;ref name="Deodhar and Rana"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DiPietro"/&gt; 
 
[[File:Scab.jpg|thumb|A scab covering a healing wound]]
As keratinocytes migrate, they move over granulation tissue but stay underneath the scab, thereby separating the scab from the underlying tissue.&lt;ref name="DiPietro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="larjava"/&gt; Scabs are formed on locations that are exposed to harmful UVR and the main biological function of
human wound scabs is to inhibit the exposure to UVR, thus protecting otherwise exposed cells in a wound from UVR-induced DNA damage.&lt;ref name="vanderPol, 2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van der Pol E, Mudde YD, Coumans FA, van Leeuwen TG, Sturk A, Nieuwland R | title = Wound scabs protect regenerating tissue against harmful ultraviolet radiation | journal = Medical Hypotheses | volume = 96 | pages = 39–41 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27959273 | doi = 10.1016/j.mehy.2016.09.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ums|date=November 2017}} Epithelial cells have the ability to phagocytize debris such as dead tissue and bacterial matter that would otherwise obstruct their path.

Cells can only migrate over living tissue,&lt;ref name="DiPietro"/&gt; so they must excrete collagenases and proteases like [[matrix metalloproteinases]] (MMPs) to dissolve damaged parts of the ECM in their way, particularly at the front of the migrating sheet.&lt;ref name="larjava"/&gt; Keratinocytes also dissolve the basement membrane, using instead the new ECM laid down by fibroblasts to crawl across.&lt;ref name="Santoro"/&gt;

As keratinocytes continue migrating, new epithelial cells must be formed at the wound edges to replace them and to provide more cells for the advancing sheet.&lt;ref name="Deodhar and Rana"/&gt; Proliferation behind migrating keratinocytes normally begins a few days after wounding&lt;ref name="Mulvaney"/&gt; and occurs at a rate that is 17 times higher in this stage of epithelialization than in normal tissues.&lt;ref name="Deodhar and Rana"/&gt; Until the entire wound area is resurfaced, the only epithelial cells to proliferate are at the wound edges.&lt;ref name="Bartkova"/&gt;

Growth factors, stimulated by integrins and MMPs, cause cells to proliferate at the wound edges.  Keratinocytes themselves also produce and secrete factors, including growth factors and basement membrane proteins, which aid both in epithelialization and in other phases of healing.&lt;ref name="Bayram"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bayram Y, Deveci M, Imirzalioglu N, Soysal Y, Sengezer M | title = The cell based dressing with living allogenic keratinocytes in the treatment of foot ulcers: a case study | journal = British Journal of Plastic Surgery | volume = 58 | issue = 7 | pages = 988–96 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16040019 | doi = 10.1016/j.bjps.2005.04.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Growth factors are also important for the innate immune defense of skin wounds by stimulation of the production of antimicrobial peptides and neutrophil chemotactic cytokines in keratinocytes.   
  
Keratinocytes continue migrating across the wound bed until cells from either side meet in the middle, at which point [[contact inhibition]] causes them to stop migrating.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt;  When they have finished migrating, the keratinocytes secrete the proteins that form the new basement membrane.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt;  Cells reverse the morphological changes they underwent in order to begin migrating; they reestablish [[desmosome]]s and [[hemidesmosome]]s and become anchored once again to the basement membrane.&lt;ref name="Santoro"/&gt;  [[Stratum basale|Basal cells]] begin to divide and differentiate in the same manner as they do in normal skin to reestablish the strata found in reepithelialized skin.&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt;

===Contraction===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Contraction]] --&gt;
Contraction is a key phase of wound healing with repair. If contraction continues for too long, it can lead to disfigurement and loss of function.&lt;ref name="Hinz"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hinz B | title = Masters and servants of the force: the role of matrix adhesions in myofibroblast force perception and transmission | journal = European Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 85 | issue = 3-4 | pages = 175–81 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16546559 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejcb.2005.09.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus there is a great interest in understanding the biology of wound contraction, which can be modelled in vitro using the [[collagen gel contraction assay]] or the [[dermal equivalent]] model.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grinnell F | title = Fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and wound contraction | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 124 | issue = 4 | pages = 401–4 | date = February 1994 | pmid = 8106541 | pmc = 2119916 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.124.4.401 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Myofibroblasts, which are similar to smooth muscle cells, are responsible for contraction.&lt;ref name="Mirastschijski"/&gt;  Myofibroblasts contain the same kind of actin as that found in [[smooth muscle]] cells.&lt;ref name="Hinz"/&gt;

Myofibroblasts are attracted by fibronectin and growth factors and they move along fibronectin linked to fibrin in the provisional ECM in order to reach the wound edges.&lt;ref name="Deodhar and Rana"/&gt;  They form connections to the ECM at the wound edges, and they attach to each other and to the wound edges by [[desmosomes]].  Also, at an adhesion called the [[fibronexus]], actin in the myofibroblast is linked across the cell membrane to molecules in the extracellular matrix like fibronectin and collagen.&lt;ref name="Mirastschijski"/&gt;  Myofibroblasts have many such adhesions, which allow them to pull the ECM when they contract, reducing the wound size.&lt;ref name="Hinz"/&gt;  In this part of contraction, closure occurs more quickly than in the first, myofibroblast-independent part.&lt;ref name="Mirastschijski"/&gt;

As the actin in myofibroblasts contracts, the wound edges are pulled together.  Fibroblasts lay down collagen to reinforce the wound as myofibroblasts contract.&lt;ref name="Stadelmann"/&gt; The contraction stage in proliferation ends as myofibroblasts stop contracting and commit apoptosis.&lt;ref name="Hinz"/&gt;  The breakdown of the provisional matrix leads to a decrease in hyaluronic acid and an increase in chondroitin sulfate, which gradually triggers fibroblasts to stop migrating and proliferating.&lt;ref name="Scholar and Stadelmann"/&gt;  These events signal the onset of the maturation stage of wound healing.

== Maturation and remodeling==
When the levels of collagen production and degradation equalize, the maturation phase of tissue repair is said to have begun.&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt; During maturation, [[type III collagen]], which is prevalent during proliferation, is replaced by type I collagen.&lt;ref name="Dealey"/&gt; Originally disorganized collagen fibers are rearranged, cross-linked, and aligned along [[tension lines]].&lt;ref name="Lorenz"/&gt; The onset of the maturation phase may vary extensively, depending on the size of the wound and whether it was initially closed or left open,&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt; ranging from approximately 3 days&lt;ref name=pollock/&gt; to 3 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2005/august/Schultz/Extrace-Matric-Acute-Chronic-Wounds.html worldwidewounds.com] &gt; [http://www.worldwidewounds.com/2005/august/Schultz/images/New_fig_3.jpg Figure 3 – The time relationship between the different processes of wound healing.] by Gregory S Schultz, Glenn Ladwig and Annette Wysocki – in turn adapted from Asmussen PD, Sollner B. Mechanism of wound healing. In: Wound Care. Tutorial Medical Series. Stuttgart: Hippokrates Verlag, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; The maturation phase can last for a year or longer, similarly depending on wound type.&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt;

As the phase progresses, the [[tensile strength]] of the wound increases.&lt;ref name="merc"/&gt; Collagen will reach approximately 20% of its tensile strength after 3 weeks, increasing to 80% by 12th week. The maximum scar strength is 80% of that of unwounded skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Morton LM, Phillips TJ | title = Wound healing and treating wounds: Differential diagnosis and evaluation of chronic wounds | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 74 | issue = 4 | pages = 589–605; quiz 605–6 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 26979352 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2015.08.068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since activity at the wound site is reduced, the scar loses its red appearance as [[blood vessel]]s that are no longer needed are removed by [[apoptosis]].&lt;ref name="Greenhalgh"/&gt;

The phases of wound healing normally progress in a predictable, timely manner; if they do not, healing may progress inappropriately to either a [[chronic wound]]&lt;ref name="Midwood"/&gt; such as a [[venous ulcer]] or pathological scarring such as a [[keloid scar]].&lt;ref name="O'Leary"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Leary R, Wood EJ, Guillou PJ | title = Pathological scarring: strategic interventions | journal = The European Journal of Surgery = Acta Chirurgica | volume = 168 | issue = 10 | pages = 523–34 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12666691 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Desmouliere"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Desmoulière A, Chaponnier C, Gabbiani G | title = Tissue repair, contraction, and the myofibroblast | journal = Wound Repair and Regeneration | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–12 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15659031 | doi = 10.1111/j.1067-1927.2005.130102.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors affecting wound healing==
Many factors controlling the efficacy, speed, and manner of wound healing fall under two types: local and systemic factors.&lt;ref name="Rieger"/&gt;

===Local factors===
* Moisture; keeping a wound moist rather than dry makes wound healing more rapid and with less pain and less scarring&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Metzger S | title = Clinical and financial advantages of moist wound management | journal = Home Healthcare Nurse | volume = 22 | issue = 9 | pages = 586–90 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15359168 | doi = 10.1097/00004045-200409000-00003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mechanical factors
* [[Edema]]
*[[Ionizing radiation]]
*Faculty technique of wound closure
* [[Ischemia]] and [[necrosis]]
* Foreign bodies. Sharp, small foreign bodies can penetrate the skin leaving little surface wound but causing internal injury and internal bleeding. For a glass foreign body, "frequently, an innocent skin wound disguises the extensive nature of the injuries beneath".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iconomou TG, Zuker RM, Michelow BJ | title = Management of major penetrating glass injuries to the upper extremities in children and adolescents | journal = Microsurgery | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 91–6 | year = 1993 | pmid = 8469109 | doi = 10.1002/micr.1920140202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; First-degree nerve injury requires a few hours to a few weeks to recover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nerve injury |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University, The Johns Hopkins Hospital, and Johns Hopkins Health System |website=Johns Hopkins Medicine |access-date=2 October 2016 |url= http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/centers_clinics/peripheral_nerve_surgery/conditions/nerve_injury.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; If a foreign body passes by a nerve and causes first-degree nerve injury during entry, then the sensation of the foreign body or pain due to internal wounding may be delayed by a few hours to a few weeks after entry. A sudden increase in pain during the first few weeks of wound healing could be a sign of a recovered nerve reporting internal injuries rather than a newly developed infection.
* Low [[oxygen tension]]
* Perfusion

===Systemic factors===

* [[Inflammation]]
* [[Diabetes]] – Individuals with diabetes demonstrate reduced capability in the healing of acute wounds. Additionally, diabetic individuals are susceptible to developing chronic diabetic foot ulcers, a serious complication of diabetes which affects 15% of people with diabetes and accounts for 84% of all diabetes-related lower leg amputations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brem H, Tomic-Canic M | title = Cellular and molecular basis of wound healing in diabetes | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 117 | issue = 5 | pages = 1219–22 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17476353 | pmc = 1857239 | doi = 10.1172/jci32169 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The impaired healing abilities of diabetics with diabetic foot ulcers and/or acute wounds involves multiple pathophysiological mechanisms.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt; This impaired healing involves hypoxia, fibroblast and epidermal cell dysfunction, impaired angiogenesis and neovascularization, high levels of metalloproteases, damage from reactive oxygen species and AGEs (advanced glycation end-products), decreased host immune resistance, and neuropathy.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt;
* [[Nutrient]]s – Malnutrition or nutritional deficiencies have a recognizable impact on wound healing post trauma or surgical intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arnold M, Barbul A | title = Nutrition and wound healing | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 117 | issue = 7 Suppl | pages = 42S-58S | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16799374 | doi = 10.1097/01.prs.0000225432.17501.6c }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutrients including proteins, carbohydrates, arginine, glutamine, polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, magnesium, copper, zinc and iron all play significant roles in wound healing.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Guo S, Dipietro LA | title = Factors affecting wound healing | journal = Journal of Dental Research | volume = 89 | issue = 3 | pages = 219–29 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20139336 | pmc = 2903966 | doi = 10.1177/0022034509359125 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fats and carbohydrates provide the majority of energy required for wound healing.  Glucose is the most prominent source of fuel and it is used to create cellular ATP, providing energy for angiogenesis and the deposition of new tissues.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt; As the nutritional needs of each patient and their associated wound are complex, it is suggested that tailored nutritional support would benefit both acute and chronic wound healing.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt;
* [[Metabolic disease]]s
* [[Immunosuppression]]
* [[Connective tissue]] disorders
* [[Smoking]] – Smoking causes a delay in the speed of wound repair notably in the proliferative and inflammatory phases. It also increases the likelihood of certain complications such as wound rupture, wound and flap necrosis, decrease in wound tensile strength and infection.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt;
* Age – Increased age (over 60 years) is a risk factor for impaired wound healing.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt; It is recognized that, in older adults of otherwise overall good health, the effects of aging causes a temporal delay in healing, but no major impairment with regard to the quality of healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gosain A, DiPietro LA | title = Aging and wound healing | journal = World Journal of Surgery | volume = 28 | issue = 3 | pages = 321–6 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 14961191 | doi = 10.1007/s00268-003-7397-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Delayed wound healing in patients of increasing age is associated with altered inflammatory response; for example delayed T-cell infiltration of the wound with alterations in the production of chemokines, and reduced macrophage phagocytic capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swift ME, Burns AL, Gray KL, DiPietro LA | title = Age-related alterations in the inflammatory response to dermal injury | journal = The Journal of Investigative Dermatology | volume = 117 | issue = 5 | pages = 1027–35 | date = November 2001 | pmid = 11710909 | doi = 10.1046/j.0022-202x.2001.01539.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Alcohol – Alcohol consumption impairs wound healing and also increases the chances of infection. Alcohol affects the proliferative phase of healing. A single [[unit of alcohol]] causes a negative effect on re-epithelialization, wound closure, collagen production and angiogenesis.&lt;ref name="Factors Affecting Wound Healing"/&gt;

== Research and development ==
Up until about 2000, the classic paradigm of wound healing, involving [[stem cells]] restricted to organ-specific lineages, had never been seriously challenged. Since then, the notion of [[adult stem cells]] having cellular ''plasticity'' or the ability to [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] into non-lineage cells has emerged as an alternative explanation.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt; To be more specific, [[hematopoietic]] [[progenitor cells]] (that give rise to mature cells in the blood) may have the ability ''de-differentiate''  back into hematopoietic stem cells and/or ''transdifferentiate'' into non-lineage cells, such as fibroblasts.&lt;ref name="G Song, DT Nguyen, et al."&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Song G, Nguyen DT, Pietramaggiori G, Scherer S, Chen B, Zhan Q, Ogawa R, Yannas IV, Wagers AJ, Orgill DP, Murphy GF | title = Use of the parabiotic model in studies of cutaneous wound healing to define the participation of circulating cells | journal = Wound Repair and Regeneration | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 426–32 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20546556 | pmc = 2935287 | doi = 10.1111/j.1524-475X.2010.00595.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stem cells and cellular plasticity===
Multipotent adult stem cells have the capacity to be self-renewing and give rise to different cell types. Stem cells give rise to progenitor cells, which are cells that are not self-renewing, but can generate several types of cells. The extent of stem cell involvement in cutaneous (skin) wound healing is complex and not fully understood.

It is thought that the epidermis and dermis are reconstituted by mitotically active stem cells that reside at the apex of [[rete ridges]] (basal stem cells or BSC), the bulge of [[hair follicle]]s (hair follicular stem cell or HFSC), and the papillary dermis (dermal stem cells).&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt; Moreover, bone marrow may also contain stem cells that play a major role in cutaneous wound healing.&lt;ref name="G Song, DT Nguyen, et al."/&gt;

In rare circumstances, such as extensive cutaneous injury, self-renewal subpopulations in the bone marrow are induced to participate in the healing process, whereby they give rise to collagen-secreting cells that seem to play a role during wound repair.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt; These two self-renewal subpopulations are (1) bone marrow-derived [[mesenchymal stem cells]] (MSC) and (2) [[hematopoietic stem cells]] (HSC). Bone marrow also harbors a progenitor subpopulation ([[endothelial]] progenitor cells or EPC) that, in the same type of setting, are mobilized to aid in the reconstruction of blood vessels.&lt;ref name="G Song, DT Nguyen, et al."/&gt; Moreover, it thought that, extensive injury to skin also promotes the early trafficking of a unique subclass of [[leukocytes]] (circulating [[fibrocyte]]s) to the injured region, where they perform various  functions related to wound healing.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt;

=== Wound repair versus regeneration ===
An injury is an interruption of morphology and/or functionality of a given tissue. After injury, structural tissue heals with incomplete or complete regeneration.&lt;ref name=InCompleteRegen/&gt;&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen/&gt; Whereas, tissue without an interruption to the morphology almost always completely regenerates. An example of complete regeneration without an interruption of the morphology is non-injured tissue, such as skin.&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen2/&gt; Non-injured skin has a continued replacement and regeneration of cells which always results in complete regeneration.&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen2/&gt;

There is a subtle distinction between 'repair' and 'regeneration'.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt;&lt;ref name=InCompleteRegen/&gt;&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen/&gt; ''Repair'' means ''incomplete regeneration''.&lt;ref name=InCompleteRegen&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Min | first1 =Su  | last2 = Wang | first2 = Song W. | last3 = Orr | first3 = William | name-list-format = vanc | title = Graphic general pathology: 2.3 Incomplete regeneration: | work = Pathology | publisher = pathol.med.stu.edu.cn | year = 2006 | quote = The new tissue is not the same as the tissue that was lost. After the repair process has been completed, there is a loss in the structure or function of the injured tissue. In this type of repair, it is common that granulation tissue (stromal connective tissue) proliferates to fill the defect created by the necrotic cells. The necrotic cells are then replaced by scar tissue.| url = http://pathol.med.stu.edu.cn/pathol/listEngContent2.aspx?contentID=493 | access-date = 2012-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repair or incomplete regeneration, refers to the physiologic adaptation of an organ after injury in an effort to re-establish continuity without regards to exact replacement of lost/damaged tissue.&lt;ref name=InCompleteRegen/&gt;

An example of a tissue regenerating completely after an interruption of morphology is the [[endometrium]]; the endometrium after the process of breakdown via the menstruation cycle heals with complete regeneration.&lt;ref name=CompleteRegen2&gt;{{cite web | last1 = Min | first1 =Su | last2 = Wang | first2 = Song W. | last3 = Orr | first3 = William | name-list-format = vanc | title = Graphic general pathology: 2.2 complete regeneration: | work = Pathology| publisher = pathol.med.stu.edu.cn | year = 2006 | quote = After the repair process has been completed, the structure and function of the injured tissue are completely normal. This type of regeneration is common in physiological situations. Examples of physiological regeneration are the continual replacement of cells of the skin and repair of the endometrium after menstruation. Complete regeneration can occur in pathological situations in tissues that have good regenerative capacity.  | url = http://pathol.med.stu.edu.cn/pathol/listEngContent2.aspx?ContentID=492 | access-date = 2013-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, after a tissue breakdown, such as in skin, a regeneration closer to complete regeneration may be induced by the use of biodegradable ([[collagen]]-[[glycoaminoglycan]]) scaffolds. These scaffolds are structurally analogous to [[extracellular matrix]] (ECM) found in normal/un-injured dermis.&lt;ref name="Yannas, Lee, Orgill, Skrabut, Murphy"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yannas IV, Lee E, Orgill DP, Skrabut EM, Murphy GF | title = Synthesis and characterization of a model extracellular matrix that induces partial regeneration of adult mammalian skin | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 86 | issue = 3 | pages = 933–7 | date = February 1989 | pmid = 2915988 | pmc = 286593 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.86.3.933 | bibcode = 1989PNAS...86..933Y | jstor = 33315 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundamental conditions required for tissue regeneration often oppose conditions that favor efficient wound repair, including inhibition of (1) platelet activation, (2) inflammatory response, and (3) wound contraction.&lt;ref name="Dinh Nguyen, Dennis Orgill, George Murphy"/&gt; In addition to providing support for fibroblast and endothelial cell attachment, biodegradable scaffolds inhibit wound contraction, thereby allowing the healing process to proceed towards a more-regenerative/less-scarring pathway. Pharmaceutical agents have been investigated which may be able to turn off [[myofibroblast]] differentiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Leary R, Ponnambalam S, Wood EJ | title = Pioglitazone-induced myofibroblast cell death: implications for cutaneous scarring | journal = The British Journal of Dermatology | volume = 149 | issue = 3 | pages = 665–7 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 14511015 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2133.2003.05501.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new way of thinking derived from the notion that [[heparan sulfate]]s are key player in tissue homeostasis:  the process that makes the tissue replace dead cells by identical cells. In wound areas, tissue homeostasis is lost as the heparan sulfates are degraded preventing the replacement of dead cells by identical cells. [[Heparan sulfate analogue]]s cannot be degraded by all know heparanases and glycanases and bind to the free heparin sulfate binding spots on the ECM, therefore preserving the normal tissue homeostasis and preventing scarring.&lt;ref name="Tong2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tong M, Tuk B, Hekking IM, Vermeij M, Barritault D, van Neck JW | title = Stimulated neovascularization, inflammation resolution and collagen maturation in healing rat cutaneous wounds by a heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan mimetic, OTR4120 | journal = Wound Repair and Regeneration | volume = 17 | issue = 6 | pages = 840–52 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19903305 | doi = 10.1111/j.1524-475X.2009.00548.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Barritault"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barritault D, Caruelle JP | title = [Regenerating agents (RGTAs): a new therapeutic approach] | language = French | journal = Annales Pharmaceutiques Francaises | volume = 64 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–44 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16568015 | doi = 10.1016/S0003-4509(06)75306-8 | trans-title = Regenerating agents (RGTAs): a new therapeutic approach }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Intech"&gt;Van Neck et al, Heparan sulfate proteoglycan mimetics thrive tissue regeneration: an overview.

Repair or regeneration with regards to hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a). In normal circumstances after injury [[HIF1A|HIF-1a]] is degraded by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs). Scientists found that the simple up-regulation of HIF-1a via PHD inhibitors regenerates lost or damaged tissue in mammals that have a repair response; and the continued down-regulation of Hif-1a results in healing with a scarring response in mammals with a previous regenerative response to the loss of tissue. The act of regulating HIF-1a can either turn off, or turn on the key process of mammalian regeneration.&lt;ref name=HIF-1a2015&gt;{{cite web| last = eurekalert.org staff | title = Scientist at LIMR leads study demonstrating drug-induced tissue regeneration | website = eurekalert.org | publisher = Lankenau Institute for Medical Research (LIMR), | date = 3 June 2015 | url = http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-06/mlhl-sal060215.php | access-date = 3 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HIFregulation2015&gt;Zhang Y, Strehin I, Bedelbaeva K, Gourevitch D, Clark L, Leferovich J, Messersmith PB, Heber-Katz E.

===Scarless wound healing===
''Scarless wound healing'' is a concept based on the healing or repair of the skin (or other tissue/organs) after injury with the aim of healing with subjectively and relatively ''less'' [[scar]] tissue than normally expected. Scarless healing is sometimes mixed up with the concept of ''[[scar free healing]],'' which is wound healing which results in absolutely no scar (''free'' of scarring). However they are different concepts.

A reverse to scarless wound healing is [[scarification]] (wound healing to scar more). Historically, certain cultures consider scarification attractive;&lt;ref name="Rush2005"&gt;Rush, J. (2005). Spiritual tattoo: a cultural history of tattooing, piercing, scarification, branding, and implants, Frog Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; however, this is generally not the case in the modern western society, in which many patients are turning to [[plastic surgery]] clinics with unrealistic expectations. Depending on [[scar]] type, treatment may be [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|invasive]] (intralesional steroid injections, [[surgery]]) and/or conservative ([[Cold compression therapy|compression therapy]], topical [[silicone gel]], [[brachytherapy]], [[photodynamic therapy]]).&lt;ref name="Brown2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brown BC, McKenna SP, Siddhi K, McGrouther DA, Bayat A | title = The hidden cost of skin scars: quality of life after skin scarring | journal = Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive &amp; Aesthetic Surgery | volume = 61 | issue = 9 | pages = 1049–58 | date = September 2008 | pmid = 18617450 | doi = 10.1016/j.bjps.2008.03.020 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinical judgment is necessary to successfully balance the potential benefits of the various treatments available against the likelihood of a poor response and possible complications resulting from these treatments. Many of these treatments may only have a [[placebo effect]], and the evidence base for the use of many current treatments is poor.&lt;ref name="Bayat2003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bayat A, McGrouther DA, Ferguson MW | title = Skin scarring | journal = BMJ | volume = 326 | issue = 7380 | pages = 88–92 | date = January 2003 | pmid = 12521975 | pmc = 1125033 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.326.7380.88 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, comprehension of the basic biologic processes involved in [[wound repair]] and [[tissue regeneration]] have expanded due to advances in cellular and [[molecular biology]].&lt;ref name="Clark1996"&gt;Clark, R. (1996). The molecular and cellular biology of wound repair, Springer Us.&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the principal goals in wound management are to achieve rapid wound closure with a functional tissue that has minimal aesthetic scarring.&lt;ref name="Tonnesen2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tonnesen MG, Feng X, Clark RA | title = Angiogenesis in wound healing | journal = The Journal of Investigative Dermatology.

Scarless wound healing only occurs in mammalian foetal tissues&lt;ref name="Ferguson1996" /&gt; and complete [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] is limited to lower vertebrates, such as [[salamanders]], and [[invertebrates]].&lt;ref name="Brockes2001"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brockes JP, Kumar A, Velloso CP | title = Regeneration as an evolutionary variable | journal = Journal of Anatomy | volume = 199 | issue = Pt 1-2 | pages = 3–11 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11523827 | pmc = 1594962 | doi = 10.1046/j.1469-7580.2001.19910003.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In adult humans, injured tissue are repaired by [[collagen]] deposition, collagen remodelling and eventual scar formation, where fetal wound healing is believed to be more of a regenerative process with minimal or no scar formation.&lt;ref name="Ferguson1996"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ferguson MW, Whitby DJ, Shah M, Armstrong J, Siebert JW, Longaker MT | title = Scar formation: the spectral nature of fetal and adult wound repair | journal = Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery | volume = 97 | issue = 4 | pages = 854–60 | date = April 1996 | pmid = 8628785 | doi = 10.1097/00006534-199604000-00029 | url = http://meta.wkhealth.com/pt/pt-core/template-journal/lwwgateway/media/landingpage.htm?issn=0032-1052&amp;volume=97&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=854 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, foetal wound healing can be used to provide an accessible mammalian model of an optimal healing response in adult human tissues. Clues as to how this might be achieved come from studies of wound healing in embryos, where repair is fast and efficient and results in essentially perfect regeneration of any lost tissue.

The etymology of the term scarless wound healing has a long history.&lt;ref name =scrlss20131/&gt;&lt;ref name =scrlss20132/&gt;&lt;ref name =scrlss20133/&gt; In print the antiquated concept of scarless healing was brought up the early 20th century and appeared in a paper published in the London Lancet. This process involved cutting in a surgical slant, instead of a right angle…; it was described in various Newspapers.&lt;ref name =scrlss20131&gt;{{cite news | title = Scarless Healing | newspaper = Star | location = Christchurch, New Zealand | pages = Page 4 | publisher = Star | date = 1906-07-07 | url = http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=TS19060707.2.27&amp;e=-------10-PubMetaTS-231-byDA---0elmwood-- | access-date = 2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =scrlss20132&gt;{{cite news | title = Scarless Healing | newspaper = Marlborough Express, Volume XXXIX, Issue 160, | pages = Page 1 | publisher = paperspast.natlib.govt.nz | date = 1906-07-12 | url = http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=MEX19060712.2.8 | access-date = 2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =scrlss20133&gt;{{cite news | title = A Wonderful New Surgery | newspaper = Reading Eagle | pages = Page 6 | publisher = | date = 1906-07-06 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DIctAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XJwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4204,3012981&amp;dq=scarless+healing&amp;hl=en| access-date = 2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer===
After inflammation, restoration of normal tissue integrity and function is preserved by feedback interactions between diverse cell types mediated by adhesion molecules and secreted cytokines. Disruption of normal feedback mechanisms in cancer threatens tissue integrity and enables a malignant tumor to escape the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Karin M, Clevers H | title = Reparative inflammation takes charge of tissue regeneration | journal = Nature | volume = 529 | issue = 7586 | pages = 307–15 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26791721 | pmc = 5228603 | doi = 10.1038/nature17039 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vlahopoulos SA | title = Aberrant control of NF-κB in cancer permits transcriptional and phenotypic plasticity, to curtail dependence on host tissue: molecular mode | journal = Cancer Biology &amp; Medicine | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 254–270 | date = August 2017 | pmid = 28884042 | pmc = 5570602 | doi = 10.20892/j.issn.2095-3941.2017.0029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Simulating wound healing from a growth perspective==
Considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the physical relationships governing wound healing and subsequent scarring, with mathematical models and simulations developed to elucidate these relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cumming BD, McElwain DL, Upton Z | title = A mathematical model of wound healing and subsequent scarring | journal = Journal of the Royal Society, Interface | volume = 7 | issue = 42 | pages = 19–34 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 19324672 | pmc = 2839370 | doi = 10.1098/rsif.2008.0536 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The growth of tissue around the wound site is a result of the migration of cells and collagen deposition by these cells.  The alignment of collagen describes the degree of scarring; basket-weave orientation of collagen is characteristic of normal skin, whereas aligned collagen fibers lead to significant scarring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gurtner GC, Werner S, Barrandon Y, Longaker MT | title = Wound repair and regeneration | journal = Nature | volume = 453 | issue = 7193 | pages = 314–21 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18480812 | doi = 10.1038/nature07039 | bibcode = 2008Natur.453..314G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been shown that the growth of tissue and extent of scar formation can be controlled by modulating the stress at a wound site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gurtner GC, Dauskardt RH, Wong VW, Bhatt KA, Wu K, Vial IN, Padois K, Korman JM, Longaker MT | title = Improving cutaneous scar formation by controlling the mechanical environment: large animal and phase I studies | journal = Annals of Surgery | volume = 254 | issue = 2 | pages = 217–25 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21606834 | doi = 10.1097/SLA.0b013e318220b159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of tissue can be simulated using the aforementioned relationships from a biochemical and biomechanical point of view.  The biologically active chemicals that play an important role in wound healing are modeled with Fickian diffusion to generate concentration profiles.  The balance equation for open systems when modeling wound healing incorporates mass growth due to cell migration and proliferation.  Here the following equation is used:

D&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;ρ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = Div (R) + R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,

where ''ρ'' represents mass density, ''R'' represents a mass flux (from cell migration), and ''R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents a mass source (from cell proliferation, division, or enlargement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuhl E, Steinmann P | title = Computational modeling of healing: an application of the material force method | journal = Biomechanics and Modeling in Mechanobiology | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 187–203 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 14872320 | doi = 10.1007/s10237-003-0034-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Relationships like these can be incorporated into an [[agent-based model]]s, where the sensitivity to single parameters such as initial collagen alignment, cytokine properties, and cell proliferation rates can be tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rouillard AD, Holmes JW | title = Mechanical regulation of fibroblast migration and collagen remodelling in healing myocardial infarcts | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 590 | issue = 18 | pages = 4585–602 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22495588 | pmc = 3477759 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2012.229484 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wound closure intentions{{anchor|Types}}==
Successful wound healing is dependent on various cell types, molecular mediators and structural elements.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Velnar T, Bailey T, Smrkolj V | title = The wound healing process: an overview of the cellular and molecular mechanisms | journal = The Journal of International Medical Research | volume = 37 | issue = 5 | pages = 1528–42 | date = 2009-10-01 | pmid = 19930861 | doi = 10.1177/147323000903700531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary intention===
Primary intention is the healing of a clean wound without tissue loss.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In this process, wound edges are brought together, so that they are adjacent to each other (re-approximated). Wound closure is performed with sutures (stitches), staples, or adhesive tape or glue.

Primary intention can only be implemented when the wound is precise and there is minimal disruption to the local tissue and the epithelial basement membrane, e.g. surgical incisions.&lt;ref name="Armitage 496–501"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armitage|first=Jon|last2=Lockwood|first2=Sonia | name-list-format = vanc |date=2011-10-01|title=Skin incisions and wound closure |journal=Surgery (Oxford)|series=Wound Management|volume=29|issue=10|pages=496–501|doi=10.1016/j.mpsur.2011.06.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This process is faster than healing by secondary intention.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is also less scarring associated with primary intention, as there are no large tissue losses to be filled with granulation tissue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; (Primary intention does require some granulation tissue to form.)
*Examples of primary intention include: well-repaired [[laceration]]s, well reduced [[bone fracture]]s, healing after [[flap surgery]].

===Secondary intention===
* Secondary intention is implemented when primary intention is not possible.
* This is due to wounds being created by major trauma in which there has been a significant loss in tissue or tissue damage.&lt;ref name="Armitage 496–501"/&gt;
*The wound is allowed to granulate.
*Surgeon may pack the wound with a gauze or use a drainage system.
*Granulation results in a broader scar.
*Healing process can be slow due to presence of drainage from infection.
*Wound care must be performed daily to encourage wound debris removal to allow for granulation tissue formation.
*Using antibiotics or antiseptics for the surgical wound healing by secondary intention is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norman G, Dumville JC, Mohapatra DP, Owens GL, Crosbie EJ | title = Antibiotics and antiseptics for surgical wounds healing by secondary intention | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 3 | pages = CD011712 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 27021482 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD011712.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Examples: [[gingivectomy]], [[gingivoplasty]], [[tooth extraction]] sockets, poorly reduced fractures, burns, severe lacerations, pressure ulcers.

===Tertiary intention===
(Delayed primary closure or secondary suture):
*The wound is initially cleaned, debrided and observed, typically 4 or 5 days before closure.
*The wound is purposely left open.
*Examples: healing of wounds by use of [[tissue graft]]s.

If the wound edges are not reapproximated immediately, delayed primary wound healing transpires. This type of healing may be desired in the case of contaminated wounds. By the fourth day, phagocytosis of contaminated tissues is well underway, and the processes of epithelization, collagen deposition, and maturation are occurring. Foreign materials are walled off by macrophages that may metamorphose into epithelioid cells, which are encircled by mononuclear leukocytes, forming granulomas. Usually the wound is closed surgically at this juncture, and if the "cleansing" of the wound is incomplete, chronic inflammation can ensue, resulting in prominent scarring.

==Complications of wound healing==

The major complications are many:

#Deficient scar formation: Results in [[wound dehiscence]] or rupture of the wound due to inadequate formation of granulation tissue.
#Excessive scar formation: [[Hypertrophic scar]], [[keloid]], [[desmoid]].
#Exuberant granulation ([[proud flesh]]).
#Deficient contraction (in skin grafts) or excessive contraction (in burns).
#Others: [[Dystrophic calcification]], pigmentary changes, painful scars, [[incisional hernia]]

Other complications can include [[Infection]] and [[Marjolin's ulcer]].

==Biologics, skin substitutes, biomembranes and scaffolds==
