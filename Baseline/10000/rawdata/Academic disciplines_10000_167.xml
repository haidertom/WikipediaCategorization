      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24678">The biological treatment of wastewater in the [[sewage treatment]] plant is often accomplished using conventional [[activated sludge]] systems. These systems generally require large surface areas for treatment and biomass separation units due to the generally poor settling properties of the [[sludge]]. Aerobic granules are a type of sludge that can self-immobilize flocs and microorganisms into spherical and strong compact structures. The advantages of aerobic granular sludge are excellent settleability, high biomass retention, simultaneous nutrient removal and tolerance to toxicity. Recent studies show that aerobic granular sludge treatment could be a potentially good method to treat high strength wastewaters with nutrients, toxic substances.

The aerobic granular sludge usually is cultivated in SBR (sequencing batch reactor) and applied successfully as a wastewater treatment for high strength wastewater, toxic wastewater and domestic wastewater. Compared with conventional aerobic granular processes for COD removal, current research focuses more on simultaneous nutrient removal, particularly COD, phosphorus and nitrogen, under pressure conditions, such as high salinity or thermophilic condition.

In recent years, new technologies have been developed to improve settlability. The use of '''aerobic granular sludge technology''' is one of them.

==Context==
Proponents of aerobic granular sludge technology claim "it will play an important role as an innovative technology alternative to the present activated sludge process in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment in the near future"&lt;ref name=ni&gt;{{cite book|last=Ni|first=Bing-Jie|title=Formation, Characterization and Mathematical Modeling of the Aerobic Granular Sludge|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-31280-9|url=http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/601/bfm%253A978-3-642-31281-6%252F1.pdf?auth66=1355393926_e27270dacd9faf9671be171972ced9d5&amp;ext=.pdf}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it "can be readily established and profitably used in activated sludge plants".&lt;ref name=bathe /&gt; However, in 2011 it was characterised as "not yet established as a large-scale application ... with limited and unpublished full-scale applications for municipal wastewater treatment."&lt;ref name=gao&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gao|first=Dawen|author2=Liu, Lin|author3= Liang, Hong|author4= Wu, Wei-Min|title=Aerobic granular sludge: characterization, mechanism of granulation and application to wastewater treatment|journal=Critical Reviews in Biotechnology|date=1 June 2011|volume=31|issue=2|pages=137–152|doi=10.3109/07388551.2010.497961|url=http://era.stanford.edu/pubs/Gao%20et%20al.%20%28CRB%29-2011_5579.pdf|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aerobic granular biomass==
The following  definition differentiates an aerobic granule from a simple floc with relatively good settling properties and came out of discussions which took place at the ''1st IWA-Workshop Aerobic Granular Sludge'' in Munich (2004):&lt;ref name=bathe&gt;{{cite book|last=Bathe|first=Stephan|title=Aerobic granular sludge : selected proceedings of the 1st IWA-workshop aerobic granular sludge organised by the Institute of water quality control and waste management of the technical University of Munich (TUM) in cooperation with the Institute of advanced studies on sustainability of the European Academy of sciences and arts (EASA) and the international water association (IWA)|year=2005|publisher=IWA publishing|location=Londen|isbn=978-1843395096|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(2005). "Discussion outcomes". Ede. In: ''Aerobic Granular Sludge''. Water and Environmental Management Series. IWA Publishing. Munich, pp. 165–169.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Formation of aerobic granules==
[[Image:ReactorSBR.JPG|right|thumb|220px|SBR Reactor, with aerobic granules]]

Granular sludge biomass is developed in [[sequencing batch reactor]]s (SBR) and without carrier materials. These systems fulfil most of the requirements for their formation as:

: '''Feast - Famine regime: '''short feeding periods must be selected to create feast and famine periods (Beun et al. 1999&lt;ref name="Beun J.J. 2290"&gt;Beun J.J., Hendriks A., Van Loosdrecht M.C.M., Morgenroth E., Wilderer P.A. and Heijnen J.J. (1999). Aerobic granulation in a sequencing batch reactor. ''Water Research, ''Vol.  33, No. 10, pp. 2283–2290.&lt;/ref&gt;), characterized by the presence or absence of organic matter in the liquid media, respectively. With this feeding strategy the selection of the appropriate micro-organisms to form granules is achieved. When the substrate concentration in the bulk liquid is high, the granule-former organisms can store the organic matter in form of poly-''β''-hydroxybutyrate to be consumed in the famine period, giving an advantage over filamentous organisms. When an anaerobic feeding is applied this factor is enhanced, minimising the importance of short settling time and higher hydrodynamic forces.

: '''Short settling time: ''' This hydraulic selection pressure on the microbial community allows the retention granular biomass inside the reactor while flocculent biomass is washed-out. (Qin et al. 2004&lt;ref&gt;Qin L. Liu Y. and Tay J-H (2004). Effect of settling time on aerobic granulation in sequencing batch reactor''. Biochemical Engineering Journal'', Vol. 21, No. 1, pp. 47–52.&lt;/ref&gt;)

: '''Hydrodynamic shear force ''': Evidences show that the application of high [[shear forces]] favours the formation of aerobic granules and the physical granule integrity. It was found that aerobic granules could be formed only above a threshold shear force value in terms of superficial upflow air velocity above 1.2&amp;nbsp;cm/s in a column SBR, and more regular, rounder, and more compact aerobic granules were developed at high hydrodynamic shear forces (Tay et al., 2001&lt;ref&gt;Tay J.-H., Liu Q.-S. and Liu Y. (2001). The effects of shear force on the formation, structure and metabolism of aerobic granules. ''Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology'', Vol. 57, Nos. 1–2, pp. 227–233.&lt;/ref&gt;  ).

Granular activated sludge is also developed in flow-through reactors using the Hybrid Activated Sludge (HYBACS®) process,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluewaterbio.com/technology.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150828175556/http://www.bluewaterbio.com/technology.asp |archivedate=2015-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; comprising an attached-growth reactor with short retention time upstream of a suspended growth reactor. The attached bacteria in the first reactor, known as a SMART unit, are exposed to a constant high COD, triggering the expression of high concentrations of hydrolytic enzymes in the EPS layer around the bacteria (citation needed). The accelerated hydrolysis liberates soluble readily-degradable COD which promotes the formation of granular activated sludge.

==Advantages==
The development of biomass in the form of aerobic granules is being studied for its application in the removal of  [[Natural organic matter#NOM in water|organic matter]], [[Microbial metabolism#Nitrification|nitrogen]] and [[Enhanced biological phosphorus removal|phosphorus]] compounds from wastewater.
Aerobic granules in an aerobic SBR present several advantages compared to conventional activated sludge process such as:

: '''Stability and flexibility:''' the SBR system can be adapted to fluctuating conditions with the ability to withstand shock and toxic loadings

: '''Low energy requirements:''' the aerobic granular sludge process has a higher aeration efficiency due to operation at increased height, while there are neither return sludge or nitrate recycle streams nor mixing and propulsion requirements

: '''Reduced footprint:''' The increase in biomass concentration that is possible because of the high settling velocity of the aerobic sludge granules and the absence of a final settler result in a significant reduction in the required footprint.

: '''Good biomass retention:''' higher biomass concentrations inside the reactor can be achieved, and higher substrate loading rates can be treated.

: '''Presence of aerobic and anoxic zones inside the granules:''' to perform simultaneously different biological processes in the same system (Beun et al. 1999&lt;ref name="Beun J.J. 2290"/&gt;  )

: '''Reduced investment and operational costs:''' the cost of running a wastewater treatment plant working with aerobic granular sludge can be reduced by at least 20% and space requirements can be reduced by as much as 75% (de Kreuk et al., 2004&lt;ref&gt;de Kreuk, M.K.,  Bruin L.M.M. and van Loosdrecht M.C.M. (2004). Aerobic granular sludge: From idea to pilot plant.. In Wilderer, P.A. (Ed.), ''Granules 2004. IWA workshop Aerobic Granular Sludge, Technical University of Munich, 26–28 September 2004 ''(pp. 1–12). London: IWA.&lt;/ref&gt;).

The HYBACS process has the additional benefit of being a flow-through process, thus avoiding the complexities of SBR systems. It is also readily applied to the upgrading of existing flow-through activated sludge processes, by installing the attached growth reactors upstream of the aeration tank. Upgrading to granular activated sludge process enables the capacity of an existing wastewater treatment plant to be doubled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluewaterbio.com/PDF_Downloads/Case-Studies/Tubli_Municipal_Sewage_Rev8.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-09-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514063005/http://www.bluewaterbio.com/PDF_Downloads/Case-Studies/Tubli_Municipal_Sewage_Rev8.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment of industrial wastewater==
Synthetic wastewater was used in most of the works carried out with aerobic granules. These works were mainly focussed on the study of granules formation, stability and nutrient removal efficiencies under different operational conditions and their potential use to remove toxic compounds. The potential of this technology to treat industrial wastewater is under study, some of the results:

*  Arrojo et al. (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Arrojo B., Mosquera-Corral A., Garrido J.M. and Méndez R. (2004) Aerobic granulation with industrial wastewater in sequencing batch reactors. ''Water Research'', Vol. 38, Nos. 14-15, pp. 3389 – 3399&lt;/ref&gt; operated two reactors that were fed with industrial wastewater produced in a laboratory for analysis of dairy products (Total [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]] : 1500–3000&amp;nbsp;mg/L; soluble COD: 300–1500&amp;nbsp;mg/L; total nitrogen: 50–200&amp;nbsp;mg/L). These authors applied organic and nitrogen loading rates up to 7 g COD/(L·d) and 0.7 g N/(L·d) obtaining removal efficiencies of 80%.
* Schwarzenbeck ''et al. ''(2004)&lt;ref&gt;Schwarzenbeck N., Erley R.  and Wilderer P.A. (2004). Aerobic granular sludge in an SBR-system treating wastewater rich in particulate matter. ''[[Water Science and Technology]]'', Vol. 49, Nos. 11-12, pp. 41–46.&lt;/ref&gt;   treated malting wastewater which had a high content of particulate organic matter (0.9 g TSS/L). They found that particles with average diameters lower than 25-50&amp;nbsp;µm were removed at 80% efficiency, whereas particles bigger than 50&amp;nbsp;µm were only removed at 40% efficiency. These authors observed that the ability of aerobic granular sludge to remove particulate organic matter from the wastewaters was due to both incorporation into the [[biofilm]] matrix and metabolic activity of protozoa population covering the surface of the granules.
* Cassidy and Belia (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy D.P. and Belia E. (2005). Nitrogen and phosphorus removal from an abattoir wastewater in a SBR with aerobic granular sludge. ''Water Research'', Vol. 39, No. 19, pp. 4817–4823.&lt;/ref&gt;   obtained removal efficiencies for COD and P of 98% and for N and VSS over 97% operating a granular reactor fed with slaughterhouse wastewater (Total COD: 7685&amp;nbsp;mg/L; soluble COD: 5163&amp;nbsp;mg/L; [[TKN]]: 1057&amp;nbsp;mg/L and VSS: 1520&amp;nbsp;mg/L). To obtain these high removal percentages, they operated the reactor at a [[Dissolved oxygen|DO]] saturation level of 40%, which is the optimal value predicted by Beun et al. (2001) for N removal, and with an anaerobic feeding period which helped to maintain the stability of the granules when the DO concentration was limited.
* Inizan ''et al. ''(2005)&lt;ref&gt;Inizan M., Freval A., Cigana J. and Meinhold J. (2005). Aerobic granulation in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) for industrial wastewater treatment. ''Water Science and Technology'', Vol. 52, Nos. 10-11, pp. 335–343.&lt;/ref&gt;   treated industrial wastewaters from pharmaceutical industry and observed that the suspended solids in the inlet wastewater were not removed in the reactor.

Those with more complex structures are often more toxic than the simple phenol. This study was aimed at assessing the efficacy of granular sludge in UASB and SBR for the treatment of mixtures of phenolics compounds. The results indicates that anaerobic treatment by UASB and aerobic treatment by SBR can be successfully used for phenol/cresol mixture, representative of major substrates in chemical and petrochemical wastewater and the results shows proper acclimatization period is essential for the degradation of m - cresol and phenol. Moreover, SBR was found as a better alternative than UASB reactor as it is more efficient and higher concentration of m cresols can be successfully degraded.

Both strategies were successful.

==Pilot research in aerobic granular sludge==
Aerobic granulation technology for the application in wastewater treatment is widely developed at laboratory scales. The large-scale experience is growing rapidly and multiple institutions are making efforts to improve this technology:

* Since 1999 Royal HaskoningDHV (former DHV Water), Delft University of technology (TUD), STW (Dutch Foundation for Applied Technology) and STOWA (Dutch Foundation for Applied Water Research) have been cooperating closely on the development of the aerobic granular sludge technology ([http://www.royalhaskoningdhv.com/en-gb/nereda Nereda]). In September 2003, a first extensive pilot plant research was executed at STP Ede, the Netherlands with focus on obtaining stable granulation and biological nutrient removal. Following the positive outcome together with six Dutch Water Boards the parties decided to establish a Public-Private Partnership (PPP)- the National Nereda Research Program [http://www.neredannop.nl (NNOP)]- to mature,  further scale-up and implement several full-scale units. As part of this PPP extensive pilot tests have been executed between 2003 and 2010 at multiple sewage treatment plants. Currently more than 20 plants are running or under construction across 3 continents.
* From the basis of the aerobic granular sludge but using a contention system for the granules, a [[sequencing batch biofilter granular reactor]] (SBBGR) with a volume of 3.1m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; was developed by IRSA (Istituto di Ricerca Sulle Acque, Italy). Different studies were carried out in this plant treating sewage at an Italian wastewater treatment plant.
* The use of aerobic granules prepared in laboratory, as a starter culture, before adding in main system, is the base of the technology ARGUS ([[Aerobic granules upgrade system]]) developed by EcoEngineering Ltd.. The granules are cultivated on-site in small bioreactors called propagators and fill up only 2 to 3% of the main bioreactor or fermentor (digestor) capacity.  This system is being used in a pilot plant with a volume of 2.7 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; located in one Hungarian pharmaceutical industry.
* The Group of Environmental Engineering and Bioprocesses from the University of Santiago de Compostela is currently operating a 100 L pilot plant reactor.

The feasibility study showed that the aerobic granular sludge technology seems very promising (de Bruin et al., 2004.&lt;ref&gt;de Bruin L.M.M., de Kreuk M.K., van der Roest H.F.R., Uijterlinde C. and van Loosdrecht M.C.M. (2004). Aerobic granular sludge technology: and alternative to activated sludge. ''Water Science and Technology'', Vol. 49, Nos. 11-12, pp. 1–7)&lt;/ref&gt; Based on total annual costs a GSBR ([[Granular sludge sequencing batch reactors]]) with pre-treatment and a GSBR with post-treatment proves to be more attractive than the reference activated sludge alternatives (6-16%).
A sensitivity analysis shows that the GSBR technology is less sensitive to land price and more sensitive to rain water flow. Because of the high allowable volumetric load the footprint of the GSBR variants is only 25% compared to the references. However, the GSBR with only primary treatment cannot meet the present effluent standards for municipal wastewater, mainly because of exceeding the suspended solids effluent standard caused by washout of not well settleable biomass.

==Full scale application ==
Aerobic granulation technology is already successfully applied for treatment of wastewater.

* Since 2005, RoyalHaskoningDHV has implemented more than 20 full-scale aerobic granular sludge technology systems (Nereda) for the treatment of both industrial and municipal wastewater across 3 continents. One example is STP Epe, The Netherlands, with a capacity of 59.000 pe and 1,500 m3.h-1, being the first full-scale municipal Nereda in The Netherlands. Examples of the latest Nereda sewage treatment  plants (2012-2013) include Wemmershoek- South Africa, Dinxperlo,  Vroomshoop, Garmerwolde - The Netherlands.

[[Image:api20ne.jpg|right|thumb|200px|API 20NE Detection system after 24 hours incubation.]]
The '''analytical profile index''' or '''API''' is a [[Biological classification|classification]] of [[bacteria]] based on experiments, allowing fast [[Identification (biology)|identification]]. This system is developed for quick identification of clinically relevant bacteria. Because of this, only known bacteria can be identified.

It was invented in the 1970s in the United States by Pierre Janin of Analytab Products, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=3936356.PN.&amp;OS=PN/3936356&amp;RS=PN/3936356{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Presently, the API test system is manufactured by bioMérieux.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.biomerieux-diagnostics.com/servlet/srt/bio/clinical-diagnostics/dynPage?doc=CNL_PRD_CPL_G_PRD_CLN_11 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-11-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525182032/http://www.biomerieux-diagnostics.com/servlet/srt/bio/clinical-diagnostics/dynPage?doc=CNL_PRD_CPL_G_PRD_CLN_11 |archive-date=2009-05-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The API range introduced a standardized, miniaturized version of existing techniques, which up until then were complicated to perform and difficult to read.

The API 20E/NE fast identification system combines some conventional tests and allows the identification of a limited number of [[Gram-negative]] [[Enterobacteriaceae]] or non-Enterobacteriaceae. The test systems are stored in 20 small reaction tubes, which include the substrates. An identification is only possible with [[microbiological culture]].      
To guarantee a comparability of different samples, follow the instructions of the manufacturer.

Before starting a test, one must confirm the culture is of an Enterobacteriaceae. To test this, a quick [[oxidase test]] for [[cytochrome c oxidase]] is performed. Enterobacteriaceae are typically oxidase negative, meaning they either do not use oxygen as an electron acceptor in the [[electron transport chain]], or they use a different cytochrome enzyme for transferring electrons to oxygen. If the culture is determined to be oxidase positive, alternative tests must be carried out to correctly identify the bacterial species.

API stands for Analytical Profile Index and is a commercial system to identify different bacteria. One of the API systems is specific for differentiating between members of the Gram negative bacterial Family Enterobacteriaceae and is called API-20E. The other API system is specific for Gram positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus species, Micrococcus, species, and related organisms, and is called API-Staph.

API test strips consists of wells containing dehydrated substrates to detect enzymatic activity, usually related to fermentation of carbohydrate or catabolism of proteins or amino acids by the inoculated organisms. A bacterial suspension is used to rehydrate each of the wells and the strips are incubated. During incubation, metabolism produces color changes that are either spontaneous or revealed by the addition of reagents. For example, when carbohydrates are fermented, the pH within the well decreases and that change is indicated by a change in the color of the pH indicator. All positive and negative test results are compiled to obtain a profile number, which is then compared with profile numbers in a commercial codebook (or online) to determine the identification of the bacterial species.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12126">[[Image:Grassyridgebald-north1.jpg|right|300px|thumb|[[Grassy Ridge Bald]] in the [[Roan Highlands]]]]
In the [[Appalachian Mountains]] of the eastern [[United States]], '''balds''' are mountain summits or crests covered primarily by thick vegetation of native grasses or shrubs occurring in areas where heavy forest growth would be expected. 

Balds are found primarily in the Southern Appalachians, where, even at the highest elevations, the climate is too warm to support an [[alpine tundra|alpine zone]], areas where trees fail to grow due to short or non-existent growing seasons.&lt;ref&gt;Peter White, "Balds," ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 47.&lt;/ref&gt;  The difference between an alpine summit, such as [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]] in [[New Hampshire]], and a bald, such as [[Gregory Bald]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]], is that a lack of trees is normal for the colder climate of the former but abnormal for the warmer climate of the latter. One example of  southern balds' abnormality can be found at [[Roan Mountain (Roan Highlands)|Roan Mountain]], where Roan High Knob (el. 6,285 ft/1,915 m) is coated with a dense stand of [[Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest|spruce-fir forest]], whereas an adjacent summit, Round Bald (el. 5,826 ft/1,776 m), is almost entirely devoid of trees. Why some summits are bald and some are not is a mystery, though there are several hypotheses.

==Types==
[[Image:Gregory-bald-northeast1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Clear vistas make grassy balds attractive to hikers]]
Two types of balds are found in the Appalachians:  

===Grassy balds===
'''Grassy balds''' are relatively blunt summits covered by a dense sward of native grasses. Two types have been identified: those completely covered by grasses and those with a scattered overstory of [[deciduous forest|mixed hardwood]]s with a grassy [[herbaceous layer]]. Grassy balds are normally found at the summit of hills, but can also be found on broad upper slopes.&lt;ref name="Peter White 2006"&gt;Peter White, "Balds," ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Species found here include mountain oat-grass (''[[Danthonia compressa]]''), sedges (''[[Carex]] brunnescens'' ssp. sphaerostachya, ''[[Carex]] debilis''  var. rudgei, ''[[Carex pensylvanica]]''), and [[forb]]s such as three-toothed cinquefoil (''[[Sibbaldiopsis|Sibbaldiopsis tridentata]]'') and Blue Ridge St. Johns-wort (''[[Hypericum]] mitchellianum'').&lt;ref name="vaDcr"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heath balds===
'''Heath balds''' are typically found along narrow ridges and mountain crests, and consist of dense evergreen shrubs.  While the formation of grassy balds is a mystery, heath balds are often located in areas where the soil experiences heavy drainage or is highly acidic, which would complicate the growth of large wooded plants.&lt;ref name="Peter White 2006"/&gt; 

Four general types of vegetation are found on heath balds:
* Evergreen shrublands of Catawba rhododendron (''[[Rhododendron catawbiense]]'')&lt;ref name = "vaDcr"/&gt;
* Mixed shrublands of Catawba rhododendron, mountain-laurel (''[[Kalmia latifolia]]''), and black huckleberry (''[[Gaylussacia baccata]]'')&lt;ref name = "vaDcr"/&gt;
* Deciduous shrublands of American mountain-ash (''[[Sorbus americana]]''), minniebush (''[[Menziesia]] pilosa''), and southern mountain-cranberry (''[[Vaccinium erythrocarpum]]'')&lt;ref name = "vaDcr"/&gt;
* Deciduous shrubland of smooth blackberry (''[[Rubus]] canadensis'')&lt;ref name = "vaDcr"/&gt;

==Origin and dynamics==

The character and distribution of Appalachian balds remained stable from the time the first naturalists explored the region, until forestry regulations no longer permitted annual pasturing of local cattle. How and why a summit develops into a grassy bald is unknown; they represent "an ecological enigma and a conservation dilemma".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter D. |last=Weigl |first2=Travis W. |last2=Knowles |year=1995 |title=Megaherbivores and Southern Appalachian Grass Balds |journal=Growth and Change |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=365–382 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2257.1995.tb00176.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Weigl and Knowles note that "the presence of both rare, endemic plants and northern relicts requiring open habitat suggests a long evolutionary history" and offer a scenario in which grazing pressure of the giant herbivores of the [[Pleistocene]] retained the open [[tundra]] habitat as the [[Wisconsin glaciation]] retreated far to the north. With the arrival of the [[paleoindians]] and the disappearance of the [[megaherbivore]]s, grazing pressure was maintained by deer and elk, and then by the grazing animals of European settlers. Some recent studies have attempted to uncover the vegetation history of some balds through analysis of the soil's organic component, since grasses leave a characteristic [[carbon-13]] fingerprint.&lt;ref&gt;Knoepp, Jennifer D.; Tieszen, Larry L.; Fredlund, Glen G. (1998). ''Assessing the vegetation history of three Southern Appalachian balds through soil organic matter analysis''  Res. Pap. SRS-13. Asheville, NC: U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Southern Research Station. 12 p&lt;/ref&gt;  While there is some evidence that grassy balds have natural origins, the forest quickly started to reclaim the balds once large-scale livestock grazing was eliminated by the creation of national parks and national forests.  Grassy balds such as [[Gregory Bald]] and [[Andrews Bald]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park|Great Smokies]] and the balds in the [[Roan Highlands]] are currently maintained as bald areas by the National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service.&lt;ref&gt;Peter White, "Balds," ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville:  University of Tennessee Press, 2006), 47-48.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The mountaintop meadows called the ''Southern Balds'' form a distinctive stretch for hikers of the [[Appalachian Trail]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.asp?trailid=HGD044-001 Appalachian Trail: Southern Balds Section] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091518/http://www.trails.com/tcatalog_trail.asp?trailid=HGD044-001 |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, the application of attachment theory to health care may enable health care practitioners to provide more personalized medicine by creating a deeper understanding of patient distress and allowing clinicians to better meet their needs and expectations.

==History of Attachment Theory==
{{main|History of attachment theory}} {{see also|Attachment Theory}}

===Infant attachment===
[[John Bowlby]] and [[Mary Ainsworth]] developed attachment theory in the 1960s while investigating the effects of [[Maternal deprivation|maternal separation]] on infant development.&lt;ref name="bretherton1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bretherton|first1=Inge|title=The origins of attachment theory: John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth.|journal=Developmental Psychology|date=1992|volume=28|issue=5|pages=759–775|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.28.5.759}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of the [[Strange Situation]] task in 1965 by Ainsworth and Wittig allowed researchers to systematically investigate the attachment system operating between children and their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mary|first1=Ainsworth|title=Patterns of attachment : a psychological study of the strange situation|date=1978|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Hillsdale, N.J.|isbn=978-0-89859-461-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Strange Situation involves separating infant-parent dyads and observing infant behaviours upon reunion. Infant behaviour tended to follow patterns, leading to the development of three attachment categories: Secure, Anxious-Avoidant, and Anxious-Resistant. In 1990, Ainsworth added a new category, championed by [[Mary Main]], called Disorganized/Disoriented attachment, characterized by its less reliable pattern of behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Main, M., &amp; Solomon, J. (1986). Discovery of a new, insecure-disorganized/disoriented attachment pattern. In M. Yogman &amp; T. B. Brazelton (Eds.), Affective development in infancy (pp. 95–124). Norwood, NJ: Ablex.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowlby believed attachment to be a primary biological drive to achieve proximity with a caregiver that transforms across child development to also encompass a psychological drive to find security by achieving a preferred interpersonal distance with an important caregiver he called an attachment figure.&lt;ref name="bretherton1992" /&gt; Insecure attachment patterns develop when caregivers are experienced as inconsistent or unpredictable, which necessitates the development of different strategies to achieve a sense of comfort and safety within an interpersonal setting. Furthermore, he posited that attachment figures function as a ''secure base'' that facilitate environmental eexploration and that ''attachment behaviours'' are triggered by perceived stress, danger or pain, and are thus ''state dependent''.&lt;ref name="fonagy2001"&gt;{{cite book|title=Attachment and Psychoanalysis|date=2001|publisher=Other Press|last1=Fonagy|first1=P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adult attachment===
{{main|Attachment in adults}}

In the late 1980s Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver applied attachment theory to adult romantic relationships based on observations of the interactions between adult romantic partners.☃☃ They noticed that romantic partners often prefer to be physically close, become anxious when they are separated and that stressful situations can be buffered by the presence of a romantic partner. Three main methods of measuring adult attachment have been developed (see [[attachment measures]]), with slightly different purposes and variable amounts of concordance between them.&lt;ref name= eagle2013 /&gt; Some aim to categorize attachment style while others rate degrees of attachment anxiety and avoidance.

==Attachment Styles==
Attachment styles refer to characteristic patterns of thought concerning the ability of self and others to help an individual achieve security. Longitudinal studies have suggested attachment is fairly stable from childhood to adulthood.&lt;ref name="Weinfield2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Sroufe|first2=LA|last3=Egeland|first3=B|date=2000|title=Attachment from infancy to early adulthood in a high-risk sample: continuity, discontinuity, and their correlates.|journal=Child Development|volume=71|issue=3|pages=695–702|pmid=10953936|last1=Weinfield|first1=NS|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="waters2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Merrick|first2=S|last3=Treboux|first3=D|last4=Crowell|first4=J|last5=Albersheim|first5=L|date=2000|title=Attachment security in infancy and early adulthood: a twenty-year longitudinal study|journal=Child Development|volume=71|issue=3|pages=684–9|pmid=10953934|last1=Waters|first1=E|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00176|citeseerx=10.1.1.541.384}}&lt;/ref&gt; When shifts do occur it is usually with good reason, with shifts away from secure attachment due to increased hardship and shifts towards secure related to finding partners in adulthood or finding symbolic attachments (God, places, pets) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Segal|first1=DL|last2=Needham|first2=TN|last3=Coolidge|first3=FL|title=Age differences in attachment orientations among younger and older adults: evidence from two self-report measures of attachment|journal=International Journal of Aging &amp; Human Development|date=2009|volume=69|issue=2|pages=119–32|pmid=19960862|doi=10.2190/ag.69.2.c|citeseerx=10.1.1.472.7765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secure===
Securely attached people generally have positive views about themselves and about others. They tend to agree with statements "It is relatively easy for me to become emotionally close to others. I am comfortable depending on others and having others depend on me. I don't worry about being alone or others not accepting me."&lt;ref name="bartholomew&amp;horowitz1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Horowitz|first2=LM|date=August 1991|title=Attachment styles among young adults: a test of a four-category model.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=61|issue=2|pages=226–44|pmid=1920064|last1=Bartholomew|first1=K|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.2.226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insecure===
'''Anxious-preoccupied''' people tend to view themselves less positively than okthey view others. They are more likely to become highly anxious when they are away from their attachment partners and are at risk of becoming, or seeming, dependent. They tend to agree with statements such as “I want to be completely emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like", and "I am uncomfortable being without close relationships, but I sometimes worry that others don't value me as much as I value them." &lt;ref name="bartholomew&amp;horowitz1991" /&gt;

'''Avoidant-dismissive''' people tend to have a positive view of themselves and a less positive view of others. They often highly value independence and become uncomfortable in, or resist, situations where they become dependent on others. They tend to agree with statements such as "I am comfortable without close emotional relationships", "It is very important to me to feel independent and self-sufficient", and "I prefer not to depend on others or have others depend on me." This is considered to be roughly equivalent to the anxious-avoidant style in children.&lt;ref name="bartholomew&amp;horowitz1991" /&gt;

'''Fearful-avoidant''' people tend to have conflicted, and often negative, views of themselves and of others. They often desire to have emotional relationships but feel uncomfortable when others get too close. They tend to agree with statements such as "I am somewhat uncomfortable getting close to others. I want emotionally close relationships, but I find it difficult to trust others completely, or to depend on them. I sometimes worry that I will be hurt if I allow myself to become too close to others."&lt;ref name="bartholomew&amp;horowitz1991" /&gt; People with loss or trauma in childhood are at greater risk of developing this style of attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Byun|first1=S|last2=Brumariu|first2=LE|last3=Lyons-Ruth|first3=K|title=Disorganized Attachment in Young Adulthood as Partial Mediator of Relations Between Severity of Childhood Abuse and Dissociation |journal=Journal of Trauma &amp; Dissociation|date=2 February 2016|pmid=26836233|pmc=5004628|doi=10.1080/15299732.2016.1141149|volume=17|issue=4|pages=460–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insecure Attachment Styles in Healthcare Settings===

'''Anxious-Preoccupied'''
People with anxious-preoccupied attachment tend to be hypervigilant to signs of danger and to worry or catastrophize about symptoms. In health care appointments, their narrative is full of intense negative emotion but relatively sparse in the specific detail desired by health care providers. This presentation can readily be perceived as “needy” or “dramatic”. If the healthcare provider pulls away in response it may reinforce the patient’s need to articulate their distress, creating a cycle of distress-withdrawal-distress.&lt;ref name="maunder&amp;hunter2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maunder|first1=R|last2=Hunter|first2=J|title=Love, Fear and Health: How our attachments to others shape health and health care|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2015"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunter|first1=J|last2=Maunder|first2=R|title=Improving Patient Treatment with Attachment Theory: a guide for primary care providers and specialists|date=2015|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Avoidant-Dismissive'''
People with avoidant dismissive attachment emphasizetheir independence and minimizing expressing distress. They may delay seeking healthcare (see healthcare utilization), minimize reporting symptoms and disclose limited personal information.&lt;ref name="maunder&amp;hunter2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2015" /&gt;

'''Fearful-Disorganized'''
People with fearful attachment often avoid routine healthcare, but present in a crisis with volatile, intense, negative emotions. Due to their degree of distress, they can present a disorganized narrative that is difficult for providers to follow and interpret diagnostically.&lt;ref name="maunder&amp;hunter2015" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2015" /&gt;

==Working Model== 
Working models are representatives of the cognitive [[Schema (psychology)|schema]], or psychological structure (often unconscious), which underlie the different attachment classifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zimmermann|first1=P|title=Structure and functions of internal working models of attachment and their role for emotion regulation|journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development|date=December 1999|volume=1|issue=3|pages=291–306|pmid=11708228|doi=10.1080/14616739900134161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working models develop in children over time based on their experiences with their attachment figures. The cognitive schema for attachment consists of views of the efficacy of self and other to create security in times of distress.

===Bartholomew and Horowitz Model===
Bartholomew and Horowitz proposed and verified a working model based on two dimensions; the view of the self (self-esteem) and the view of others (sociability)&lt;ref name="bartholomew&amp;horowitz1991" /&gt;
*Secure- Positive view of self, Positive view of other 
*Dismissive- Positive view of self, Negative view of other
*Preoccupied- Negative view of self, Positive view of other
*Fearful- Negative view of self, Negative view of other

===Prototype-Insecurity Classification Model===
In 2012 Maunder and Hunter&lt;ref name="maunder&amp;hunter2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maunder|first1=RG|last2=Hunter|first2=JJ|title=A prototype-based model of adult attachment for clinicians|journal=Psychodynamic Psychiatry|date=December 2012|volume=40|issue=4|pages=549–73|pmid=23216396|doi=10.1521/pdps.2012.40.4.549}}&lt;/ref&gt; combined the internal working model with the attitudes, behaviours and emotional expression of the different styles to create a prototype based classification that included severity of insecurity. This model was designed to be clinically useful, allowing healthcare providers to identify and predict the behaviours of patients whose attachment systems were activated by pain and illness.

They distinguish the different attachment styles by; 1) attachment anxiety, the discomfort someone feels when separated, 2) attachment avoidance, which is discomfort associated with closeness and 3) severity of insecurity 
*Secure- Low anxiety, low avoidance, low severity of insecurity 
*Dismissive- Low anxiety, high avoidance, moderate insecurity 
*Preoccupied- High anxiety, low avoidance, moderate insecurity 
*Fearful- High anxiety, high avoidance, high insecurity 
*Disorganized- High anxiety, high avoidance, high insecurity. The difference between disorganized and fearful is that people with disorganized attachment do not use a consistent strategy to find security.

==Attachment and health outcomes==
Attachment and health interact on multiple levels. Attachment is a biologically based system tied to our response to distress and attachment styles appear to confer differences in stress physiology. Illness and pain themselves act as an “activating signal” for attachment systems, and health care providers act as attachment figures in their role addressing illness and pain. Accordingly, attachment styles influence patient perception of illness, health care utilization, medication compliance and treatment response.&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="feeney2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feeney|first1=J A|title=Implications of attachment style for patterns of health and illness|journal=Child: Care, Health and Development|date=July 2000|volume=26|issue=4|pages=277–288|doi=10.1046/j.1365-2214.2000.00146.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical health===
While strong social support has been linked to greater resilience to stress and lower medical morbidity and mortality, the mechanism behind this association is poorly understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ozbay|first1=F|last2=Fitterling|first2=H|last3=Charney|first3=D|last4=Southwick|first4=S|title=Social support and resilience to stress across the life span: a neurobiologic framework|journal=Current Psychiatry Reports|date=August 2008|volume=10|issue=4|pages=304–10|pmid=18627668|doi=10.1007/s11920-008-0049-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, Paul Ciechanowski investigated the role of attachment styles in patients managing diabetes, finding that individuals with an avoidant-dismissive style were less likely to be compliant with treatment recommendations and had less well-controlled disease as measured by glycosylated hemoglobin.&lt;ref name="ciechanowski2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Russo|first2=J|last3=Katon|first3=W|last4=Von Korff|first4=M|last5=Ludman|first5=E|last6=Lin|first6=E|last7=Simon|first7=G|last8=Bush|first8=T|date=2004|title=Influence of patient attachment style on self-care and outcomes in diabetes|journal=Psychosomatic Medicinevolume=66|issue=5|pages=720–8|pmid=15385697|last1=Ciechanowski|first1=P|doi=10.1097/01.psy.0000138125.59122.23|volume=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger scale evidence comes from a large American survey of self-reported attachment styles and physical illness conducted by McWilliams and Bailey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McWilliams|first=Lachlan A.|last2=Bailey|first2=S.

Specifically, they found preoccupied individuals reported more heart disease, and dismissive individuals more pain conditions. A prospective study followed children until the age of 32 and found a similar pattern of results. They found that people with anxious-resistant (dismissive) styles of attachment reported vague, non-specific symptoms more often, and those with anxious-preoccupied classification had a higher rate of inflammation-based illnesses. This prospective study was particularly important because of the difficulty assigning causation in the often observed relationship between chronic pain and insecure attachment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=K.

Causal relationships between insecure attachment and mental illness may be complex.&lt;ref name="fonagy2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eagle2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2015" /&gt; Some risk factors for insecure attachment such as loss of parental figure, and sexual or physical abuse, are also risk factors for mental health disorders.&lt;ref name="eagle2013" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Eagle|first1=M.|title=Attachment and Psychoanalysis: Theory, research and clinical|date=2013|publisher=Guilford|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-report measures of attachment may be biased by mental health conditions. For example, clinical depression is often associated with negative thoughts about the self, and this cognitive bias may influence the self-report in attachment questionnaires. There may be interpersonal consequences from untreated mental health conditions. Pre-existing psychological problems can increase the likelihood of secure attachment changing to insecure attachment over time.&lt;ref name="mikulincer&amp;shaver2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Shaver|first2=PR|date=February 2012|title=An attachment perspective on psychopathology|journal=World Psychiatry : Official Journal of the World Psychiatric Association (WPA)|volume=11|issue=1|pages=11–5|pmid=22294997|last1=Mikulincer|first1=M|doi=10.1016/j.wpsyc.2012.01.003|pmc=3266769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms by which Attachment Influences Health==
Maunder and Hunter outline 3 ways in which insecure attachment can serve as a risk factor for health problems: 1) it may increase one’s susceptibility to stress by changing stress physiology, 2) it may be related to potentially harmful behaviours undertaken to regulate affect, and 3) it may change the way people interact with the healthcare system.&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2001" /&gt;

===Attachment and Stress===
See also: [[stress (biology)]], [[stress (psychological)]]
The stress response in humans is largely governed by the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]] (HPA) and [[sympathetic nervous system]]. The HPA axis has garnered particular attention from attachment researchers because it is known to be activated by social stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Lisa M.|title=Contributions of Psychophysiology to Research on Adult Attachment: Review and Recommendations|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=November 2001|volume=5|issue=4|pages=276–295|doi=10.1207/S15327957PSPR0504_1|citeseerx=10.1.1.327.2676}}&lt;/ref&gt; The normal response for this system is to release stress hormones, particularly cortisol, for a brief duration and then shut itself off due to negative feedback, resulting in a short, strong release of cortisol. The HPA axis also follows a [[circadian rhythm]], with highest release within about 30 minutes to 1 hour upon awakening, called the cortisol response to awakening (CRA), and a slow taper throughout the day. Researchers have looked at both cortisol response to stress (CRS) and CRA to determine if attachment anxiety and avoidance underlie individual differences in HPA activity.

Findings in the field have inconsistent. The evidence suggests that (a) individuals with high attachment anxiety perceive a higher degree of distress when faced with a stressor and have higher baseline anxiety compared to those low in attachment anxiety,&lt;ref name="ditzen2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ditzen|first1=B|last2=Schmidt|first2=S|last3=Strauss|first3=B|last4=Nater|first4=UM|last5=Ehlert|first5=U|last6=Heinrichs|first6=M|title=Adult attachment and social support interact to reduce psychological but not cortisol responses to stress|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|date=May 2008|volume=64|issue=5|pages=479–86|pmid=18440400|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2007.11.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maunder2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Maunder|first1=Robert G.|last2=Lancee|first2=William J.|last3=Nolan|first3=Robert P.|last4=Hunter|first4=Jonathan J.|last5=Tannenbaum|first5=David W.|title=The relationship of attachment insecurity to subjective stress and autonomic function during standardized acute stress in healthy adults|journal=Journal of Psychosomatic Research|date=March 2006|volume=60|issue=3|pages=283–290|doi=10.1016/j.jpsychores.2005.08.013|pmid=16516661}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kidd2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kidd|first1=Tara|last2=Hamer|first2=Mark|last3=Steptoe|first3=Andrew|title=Adult attachment style and cortisol responses across the day in older adults|journal=Psychophysiology|date=September 2013|volume=50|issue=9|pages=841–847|doi=10.1111/psyp.12075|pmid=23808770|pmc=4298031}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dewitte2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewitte|first1=Marieke|last2=De Houwer|first2=Jan|last3=Goubert|first3=Liesbet|last4=Buysse|first4=Ann|title=A multi-modal approach to the study of attachment-related distress|journal=Biological Psychology|date=September 2010|volume=85|issue=1|pages=149–162|doi=10.1016/j.biopsycho.2010.06.006|pmid=20600574|url=https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/1091912|format=Submitted manuscript}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The finding that those with fearful attachment would show small cortisol reactivity in response to a stressor may seem counterintuitive but is in line with the predictions of stress researcher [[Bruce McEwen]], who hypothesized that frequent early stressors in life would cause an initial hyper-reactivity in the HPA axis that would over time become pathologically sluggish as the individual ages, leading to greater overall cortisol release and less adaptive responsivity.&lt;ref name="mcewen2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McEwen|first1=BS|title=Allostasis and allostatic load: implications for neuropsychopharmacology.|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|date=February 2000|volume=22|issue=2|pages=108–24|pmid=10649824|doi=10.1016/s0893-133x(99)00129-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related biological system that regulates stress response is the [[autonomic nervous system]]. In general, the sympathetic system is activated during times of stress and the parasympathetic system acts to decrease physical readiness for stress. These systems are sometimes called the “fight-or-flight” and “rest-or-digest” systems, respectively, and operate in a balance, as opposed to being totally on or off. Researchers can approximate the relative balance by looking at skin conductance, blood pressure and heart rate. Studies of this kind provided hard evidence that avoidant infants were truly distressed during the strange situation task&lt;ref name="gander2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gander|first1=Manuela|last2=Buchheim|first2=Anna|title=Attachment classification, psychophysiology and frontal EEG asymmetry across the lifespan: a review|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|date=19 February 2015|volume=9|pages=79|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2015.00079|pmid=25745393|pmc=4333768}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite their minimally distressed appearance as they showed elevations in heart rate when caregivers were away and took longer to return to baseline when the caregiver returned in comparison to securely attached infants. Studies of skin conductance and heart rate in adults have shown that those with avoidant attachment and anxious attachment will show markers of increased distress during attachment and non-attachment stressors compared to those securely attached.&lt;ref name="maunder2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gander2015" /&gt;

===Health behaviours===
According to attachment theory people with insecure attachment have less effective strategies for dealing with negative emotions compared to people with secure attachment. One way in which insecurely individuals may try to regulate their distress is by using strategies or behaviours that are attractive for their short term relief but may have deleterious risks over years like eating, drug use or risky sex. 
In a survey of 356 primary care patients in Toronto, rates of smoking, harmful drinking and obesity, were all found to be highest in those with the most severe anxious and avoidant attachment.&lt;ref name="hunter&amp;maunder2015" /&gt; Both attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance have been linked in separate studies to increasing the risk of eating disorders and substance use in adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Kearney|first1=R|title=Attachment disruption in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa: a review of theory and empirical research.|journal=The International Journal of Eating Disorders|date=September 1996|volume=20|issue=2|pages=115–27|pmid=8863063|doi=10.1002/(sici)1098-108x(199609)20:2&lt;115::aid-eat1&gt;3.0.co;2-j}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schindler|first1=Andreas|last2=Bröning|first2=Sonja|title=A Review on Attachment and Adolescent Substance Abuse: Empirical Evidence and Implications for Prevention and Treatment|journal=Substance Abuse|date=25 November 2014|volume=36|issue=3|pages=304–313|doi=10.1080/08897077.2014.983586|pmid=25424652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eating'''
A review of attachment and eating disorder literature in 2010 showed rates of insecure attachment to be approximately 70% in eating disorder populations in contrast to the 30-40% prevalence in the normal population.&lt;ref name="zachrisson2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zachrisson|first1=HD|last2=Skårderud|first2=F|title=Feelings of insecurity: review of attachment and eating disorders.|journal=European Eating Disorders Review|date=March 2010|volume=18|issue=2|pages=97–106|pmid=20148392|doi=10.1002/erv.999}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rates are similar to those found in other mental health populations.&lt;ref name="bakermans2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bakermans-Kranenburg|first1=Marian J.|last2=van IJzendoorn|first2=Marinus H.|title=The first 10,000 Adult Attachment Interviews: distributions of adult attachment representations in clinical and non-clinical groups|journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development|date=May 2009|volume=11|issue=3|pages=223–263|doi=10.1080/14616730902814762|pmid=19455453}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review noted small trends for anxious attachment to be more highly associated with binge-purging symptomatology and avoidant attachment to be more highly associated with restrictive.&lt;ref name="zachrisson2010" /&gt; The relationship between high attachment anxiety and disinhibited eating, or binge eating, has also been found in non-clinical&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Han|first1=Suejung|last2=Pistole|first2=M.

[[Jaak Panksepp]] hypothesized in the 1980s that endogenous opioids are responsible for the warm, affiliative, interpersonal feelings that come with social connection, and this has been supported by recent evidence showing that naloxone administration, an opioid blocker, results in a decreased feeling of social connection in healthy individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Inagaki|first1=Tristen K.|last2=Ray|first2=Lara A.|last3=Irwin|first3=Michael R.|last4=Way|first4=Baldwin M.|last5=Eisenberger|first5=Naomi I.|title=Opioids and social bonding: naltrexone reduces feelings of social connection|journal=Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience|date=2016|doi=10.1093/scan/nsw006|pmid=26796966|pmc=4847702|volume=11|issue=5|pages=728–735}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work also demonstrates that attachment dimensions have bearing on natural opioid signaling, with brain scans showing that those high in attachment avoidance have decreased opioid receptor availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nummenmaa|first1=Lauri|last2=Manninen|first2=Sandra|last3=Tuominen|first3=Lauri|last4=Hirvonen|first4=Jussi|last5=Kalliokoski|first5=Kari K.|last6=Nuutila|first6=Pirjo|last7=Jääskeläinen|first7=Iiro P.|last8=Hari|first8=Riitta|last9=Dunbar|first9=Robin I.M.|last10=Sams|first10=Mikko|title=Adult attachment style is associated with cerebral μ-opioid receptor availability in humans|journal=Human Brain Mapping|date=2015|volume=36|issue=9|pages=3621–3628|doi=10.1002/hbm.22866|pmid=26046928}}&lt;/ref&gt; In clinical samples insecure attachment is related to higher opioid use in chronic pain patients&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andersen|first1=TE|title=Does attachment insecurity affect the outcomes of a multidisciplinary pain management program?

'''Sex'''
Risky sexual behaviour is defined as sexual contact with an increased risk of either unwanted pregnancy or sexually transmitted infection. In a study aimed at evaluating the evidence supporting six major risky sex theories, Leslie Simons and her colleagues found that only the social support and attachment theory had strong empirical support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simons|first1=Leslie Gordon|last2=Sutton|first2=Tara E.|last3=Simons|first3=Ronald L.|last4=Gibbons|first4=Frederick X.|last5=Murry|first5=Velma McBride|title=Mechanisms That Link Parenting Practices to Adolescents’ Risky Sexual Behavior: A Test of Six Competing Theories|journal=Journal of Youth and Adolescence|date=2015|volume=45|issue=2|pages=255–270|doi=10.1007/s10964-015-0409-7|pmid=26718543}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the attachment theory model, risk is enhanced in insecurely attached individuals due to negative working models of relationships, reduced closeness in intimate relationships and through decreased self-control. In terms of conscious motivations for sex, attachment anxiety is related to many attachment-related motivations including using sex for desire for emotional closeness, reassurance, self-esteem enhancement, stress reduction, the experience and exertion of power, elicitation of caregiving from a partner, protection from a partner’s anger or bad moods.&lt;ref name="davis2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Deborah|last2=Shaver|first2=Phillip R.|last3=Vernon|first3=Michael L.|title=Attachment Style and Subjective Motivations for Sex|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=1 August 2004|volume=30|issue=8|pages=1076–1090|doi=10.1177/0146167204264794|pmid=15257790}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those high in attachment avoidance report using sex for power or partner manipulation and endorse a desire to use sex as a way of avoiding emotional closeness.&lt;ref name="davis2004" /&gt; Accordingly, there is evidence that attachment avoidance is associated with positive attitudes towards casual sex, a higher number of casual sex partners, and an interest in emotionless sex and one-night stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beaulieu-Pelletier|first1=Genevieve|last2=Philippe|first2=Frederick L.|last3=Lecours|first3=Serge|last4=Couture|first4=Stéphanie|title=The role of attachment avoidance in extradyadic sex|journal=Attachment &amp; Human Development|date=2011|volume=13|issue=3|pages=293–313|doi=10.1080/14616734.2011.562419|pmid=21506032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attachment theory predicts that people high in attachment avoidance and people high in attachment anxiety would display different utilization of health care resources based on their prototypical behavioural responses when stressed.&lt;ref name="maunder&amp;hunter2015" /&gt; The theory predicts that people high in attachment avoidance, when faced with an illness, are likely to minimize their symptoms, and wait longer to see a health care provider, since they view their own distress as a sign of unacceptable vulnerability and also because their internal working model dictates that other people are not useful in helping them manage distress. For those high in attachment anxiety, they would have higher distress when faced with an illness, less perceived ability to manage it on their own, and thus visit health care services more frequently to try to attain security. For those with high anxiety and high avoidance, or fearful attachment, they would be predicted to present less frequently than those with secure attachment, but show up in a crisis when they do, which may interfere with optimal care. Research findings have generally been supportive of these predictions. One of the earliest studies in the field found correlations between preoccupied attachment and increased symptom reporting and an inverse relationship between avoidant attachment and visits to health professionals.&lt;ref name="feeney&amp;ryan1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ryan|first2=SM|date=July 1994|title=Attachment style and affect regulation: relationships with health behavior and family experiences of illness in a student sample|journal=Health Psychology : Official Journal of the Division of Health Psychology, American Psychological Association|volume=13|issue=4|pages=334–45|pmid=7957012|last1=Feeney|first1=JA|doi=10.1037/0278-6133.13.4.334}}&lt;/ref&gt; High attachment anxiety has been associated with increased symptom reporting and visits to healthcare providers,&lt;ref name="ciechanowski2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Katon|first2=WJ|last3=Russo|first3=JE|last4=Walker|first4=EA|date=January 2001|title=The patient-provider relationship: attachment theory and adherence to treatment in diabetes.|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=158|issue=1|pages=29–35|pmid=11136630|last1=Ciechanowski|first1=PS|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.158.1.29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and high attachment avoidance associated with less visits and decreased treatment compliance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=RE|last2=Marshall|first2=T|last3=Mann|first3=A|last4=Goldberg|first4=DP|title=Insecure attachment and frequent attendance in primary care: a longitudinal cohort study of medically unexplained symptom presentations in ten UK general practices.|journal=Psychological Medicine|date=2012|volume=42|issue=4|pages=855–64|pmid=21880165|doi=10.1017/s0033291711001589}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sullivan|first1=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3469">An '''audio signal''' is a representation of [[sound]], typically as an electrical [[voltage]] for [[analog signal]]s and a binary number for [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]]s. Audio signals have frequencies in the [[audio frequency]] range of roughly 20 to 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz (the [[Human hearing range|limits of human hearing]]). Audio signals may be [[Synthesizer|synthesized]] directly, or may originate at a [[transducer]] such as a [[microphone]], [[Pickup (music technology)|musical instrument pickup]], [[phonograph]] cartridge, or [[tape head]]. [[Loudspeaker]]s or [[headphones]] convert an electrical audio signal into sound.

[[Digital audio]] systems represent audio signals in a variety of digital formats.&lt;ref&gt;Hodgson, Jay (2010). ''Understanding Records'', p.1. {{ISBN|978-1-4411-5607-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''audio channel''' or '''audio track''' is an audio signal [[Channel (communications)|communications channel]] in a [[data storage device|storage device]] or [[mixing console]], used in operations such as [[multi-track recording]] and [[sound reinforcement]].

== Signal flow ==
[[Audio signal flow|Signal flow]] is the path an audio signal will take from source to the speaker or recording device. Signal flow may be short and simple as in a [[home audio]] system or long and convoluted in a [[recording studio]] and larger sound reinforcement system as the signal may pass through many sections of a large [[Mixing console|console]], external [[audio equipment]], and even different rooms.

==Parameters==
Audio signals may be characterized by parameters such as their [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], [[nominal level]], [[Electric power|power]] level in [[decibel]]s (dB), and voltage level. The relation between power and voltage is determined by the [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the signal path, which may be [[Single-ended signalling|single-ended]] or [[Balanced line|balanced]].

Audio signals have somewhat standardized levels depending on application. Outputs of professional [[Mixing console|mixing consoles]] are most commonly at [[line level]]. Consumer audio equipment will also output at a lower line level. Microphones generally output at an even lower level, commonly referred to a ''mic level''.

== Digital equivalent ==
The digital form of an audio signal is used in [[audio plug-in]]s and [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW) software. The digital information passing through the DAW (i.e. from an audio track through a plug-in and out a hardware output) is an audio signal.

A digital audio signal being sent through wire can use several formats including [[optical]] ([[ADAT]], [[TDIF]]), [[coaxial]] ([[S/PDIF]]), [[XLR connector|XLR]] ([[AES/EBU]]), and [[Audio over Ethernet|Ethernet]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20306">[[Image:Elster Type R15 electricity meter.jpeg|thumb|right|300px|Older US residential electric meter location, retrofitted with a 1-phase digital [[smart meter]].  The meter communicates to its collection point using 900 MHz [[mesh network]] topology.]]
'''Automatic meter reading''' ('''AMR''') is the technology of automatically collecting consumption, diagnostic, and status data from [[water meter]] or [[energy meter]]ing devices (gas, electric) and transferring that data to a central database for billing, troubleshooting, and analyzing.
This technology mainly saves utility providers the expense of periodic trips to each physical location to read a meter. Another advantage is that billing can be based on near real-time consumption rather than on estimates based on past or predicted consumption. This timely information coupled with analysis can help both utility providers and customers better control the use and production of electric energy, gas usage, or water consumption.

AMR technologies include handheld, mobile and network technologies based on telephony platforms (wired and wireless), radio frequency (RF), or powerline transmission.

==Technologies==

=== Touch technology===
With touch-based AMR, a meter reader carries a handheld computer or data collection device with a wand or probe. The device automatically collects the readings from a meter by touching or placing the read probe in close proximity to a reading [[Electromagnetic coil|coil]] enclosed in the touchpad. When a button is pressed, the probe sends an interrogate signal to the touch module to collect the meter reading. The software in the device matches the serial number to one in the route database, and saves the meter reading for later download to a billing or data collection computer. Since the meter reader still has to go to the site of the meter, this is sometimes referred to as "on-site" AMR. Another form of contact reader uses a standardized infrared port to transmit data. Protocols are standardized between manufacturers by such documents as [[ANSI C12.18]] or [[IEC 61107]].

=== AMR Hosting ===
AMR Hosting is a back-office solution which allows a user to track his/her [[electricity]], [[water]], or [[gas]] consumption over the Internet. All data is collected in near real-time, and is stored in a database by data acquisition software. The user can view the data via a web application, and can analyze the data using various online analysis tools such as charting load profiles, analyzing tariff components, and verify his/her utility bill.

=== Radio frequency network===
[[Radio frequency]] based AMR can take many forms. The more common ones are handheld, mobile, satellite and fixed network solutions. There are both two-way RF systems and one-way RF systems in use that use both licensed and unlicensed RF bands.

In a two-way or "wake up" system, a radio signal is normally sent to an AMR meter's unique serial number, instructing its [[transceiver]] to power-up and transmit its data. The meter transceiver and the reading transceiver both send and receive radio signals. In a one-way “bubble-up” or continuous [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] type system, the meter transmits continuously and data is sent every few seconds. This means the reading device can be a receiver only, and the meter a transmitter only. Data travels only from the meter transmitter to the reading receiver. There are also hybrid systems that combine one-way and two-way techniques, using one-way communication for reading and two-way communication for programming functions.

[[Radio frequency|RF]]-based meter reading usually eliminates the need for the meter reader to enter the property or home, or to locate and open an underground meter pit. The utility saves money by increased speed of reading, has less liability from entering private property, and has fewer missed readings from being unable to access the meter.

The technology based on RF is not readily accepted everywhere. In several Asian countries, the technology faces a barrier of regulations in place pertaining to use of the radio frequency of any radiated power. For example, in India the radio frequency which is generally in [[ISM band]] is not free to use even for low power radio of 10 [[milliwatt|mW]]. The majority of manufacturers of electricity meters have radio frequency devices in the frequency band of 433/868&amp;nbsp;MHz for large scale deployment in European countries. The frequency band of 2.4&amp;nbsp;GHz can be now used in India for outdoor as well as indoor applications, but few manufacturers have shown products within this frequency band. Initiatives in radio frequency AMR in such countries are being taken up with regulators wherever the cost of licensing outweighs the benefits of AMR.

==== Handheld ====
In handheld AMR, a meter reader carries a handheld computer with a built-in or attached receiver/transceiver (radio frequency or touch) to collect meter readings from an AMR capable meter. This is sometimes referred to as "walk-by" meter reading since the meter reader walks by the locations where meters are installed as they go through their meter reading route.  Handheld computers may also be used to manually enter readings without the use of AMR technology as an alternate but this will not support exhaustive data which can be accurately read using the meter reading electronically.

==== Mobile ====
Mobile or "drive-by" meter reading is where a reading device is installed in a vehicle. The meter reader drives the vehicle while the reading device automatically collects the meter readings. Often, for mobile meter reading, the reading equipment includes navigational and mapping features provided by [[GPS]] and mapping software. With mobile meter reading, the reader does not normally have to read the meters in any particular route order, but just drives the service area until all meters are read. Components often consist of a laptop or proprietary computer, software, RF receiver/transceiver, and external vehicle [[antennas]].

==== Satellite ====
Satellite transmitters can be installed in the field next to existing meters. The satellite AMR devices communicates with the meter for readings, and then sends those readings over a fixed or mobile satellite network.  This network requires a clear view to the sky for the satellite transmitter/receiver, but eliminates the need to install fixed towers or send out field technicians, thereby being particularly suited for areas with low geographic meter density.

==== RF technologies commonly used for AMR ====
* Narrow Band (single fixed radio frequency)
* [[Spread Spectrum]]
** [[Direct-sequence spread spectrum]] (DSSS)
** [[Frequency-hopping spread spectrum]] (FHSS)

There are also meters using AMR with RF technologies such as cellular phone data systems, [[ZigBee]], [[Bluetooth]], [[Wavenis]] and others. Some systems operate with U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) licensed frequencies and others under [[Title 47 CFR Part 15|FCC Part 15]], which allows use of unlicensed radio frequencies.

==== Wi-Fi ====
[[WiSmart]] is a versatile platform which can be used by a variety of electrical home appliances in order to provide wireless [[TCP/IP]] communication using the 802.11 b/g protocol.

Devices such as the Smart Thermostat permit a utility to lower a home's power consumption to help manage power demand.

The city of [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]] became one of the first cities in the [[United States]] to implement citywide [[Wi-Fi]], which had been free until May 31, 2007, mainly to facilitate AMR after a meter reader was attacked by a dog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=201400236 EarthLink Dedicates Wi-Fi Network In Corpus Christi]&lt;/ref&gt; Today many{{Which|date=January 2010}} meters are designed to transmit using Wi-Fi, even if a Wi-Fi network is not available, and they are read using a drive-by local Wi-Fi hand held receiver.

The meters installed in Corpus Christi are not directly Wi-Fi enabled, but rather transmit narrow-band burst [[telemetry]] on the 460&amp;nbsp;MHz band.  This narrow-band signal has much greater range than Wi-Fi, so the number of receivers required for the project are far fewer. Special receiver stations then decode the narrow-band signals and resend the data via Wi-Fi.

Most of the automated utility meters installed in the Corpus Christi area are battery powered.  Wi-Fi technology is unsuitable for long-term battery-powered operation.

=== Power line communication ===
[[Power line communication|PLC]] is a method where electronic data is transmitted over power lines back to the substation, then relayed to a central computer in the utility's main office. This would be considered a type of fixed network system—the network being the distribution network which the utility has built and maintains to deliver electric power. Such systems are primarily used for electric meter reading. Some providers have interfaced gas and water meters to feed into a PLC type system.

== Brief history==
In 1972, [[Theodore George “Ted” Paraskevakos]], while working with [[Boeing]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]], developed a sensor monitoring system which used digital transmission for security, fire and medical alarm systems as well as meter reading capabilities for all utilities. This technology was a spin-off of the automatic telephone line identification system, now known as [[Caller ID]].

In 1974, Mr. Paraskevakos was awarded a U.S. patent for this technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|3,842,208}} (Sensor Monitoring Device)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, he launched Metretek, Inc.[https://web.archive.org/web/20010223154025/http://www.metretekfl.com/], which developed and produced the first fully automated, commercially available remote meter reading and load management system. Since this system was developed pre-Internet, Metretek utilized the [[IBM Series/1|IBM series 1 mini-computer]].  For this approach, Mr. Paraskevakos and Metretek were awarded multiple patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{US Patent|4,241,237}} and {{US Patent|4,455,453}} and Canadian Patent # 1,155,243 (Apparatus and Method for Remote Sensor Monitoring, Metering and Control)&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary driver for the automation of meter reading is not to reduce labor costs, but to obtain data that is difficult to obtain.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} As an example, many water meters are installed in locations that require the utility to schedule an appointment with the homeowner in order to obtain access to the meter. In many areas, consumers have demanded that their monthly water bill be based on an actual reading, instead of (for example) an estimated monthly usage based on just one actual meter reading made every 12 months. Early AMR systems often consisted of walk-by and drive-by AMR for residential customers, and telephone-based AMR for commercial or industrial customers. What was once a need for monthly data became a need for daily and even hourly readings of the meters. Consequently, the sales of drive-by and telephone AMR has declined in the US, while sales of fixed networks has increased. The US [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] asks that electric utility regulators consider the support for a "...time-based rate schedule ''(to)'' enable the electric consumer to manage energy use and cost through advanced metering and '''communications technology'''." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/oust/fedlaws/publ_109-058.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303163112/http://www.epa.gov/oust/fedlaws/publ_109-058.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-03 |df= }} US Congress, Energy Policy Act of 2005&lt;/ref&gt;
The trend now is to consider the use of advanced meters as part of an [[Advanced Metering Infrastructure]].[[Image:First Automatic Meter Reading and Load Management System.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The First Commercially Available Remote Meter Reading and Load Management System - Metretek, Inc. (1978)]]

=== Advanced AMR and AMI ===
Originally AMR devices just collected meter readings electronically and matched them with accounts. As technology has advanced, additional data could then be captured, stored, and transmitted to the main computer, and often the metering devices could be controlled remotely. This can include events alarms such as tamper, leak detection, low battery, or reverse flow. Many AMR devices can also capture interval data, and log meter events. The logged data can be used to collect or control time of use or rate of use data that can be used for water or energy usage profiling, time of use billing, demand forecasting, [[demand response]], [[Volumetric flow rate|rate of flow]] recording, [[leak detection]], flow monitoring, [[Water conservation|water]] and [[Energy Conservation|energy conservation]] enforcement, remote shutoff, etc. [[Advanced metering infrastructure]], or AMI is the new term coined to represent the networking technology of fixed network meter systems that go beyond AMR into remote utility management. The meters in an AMI system are often referred to as [[smart meter]]s, since they often can use collected data based on programmed logic.

The Automatic Meter Reading Association (AMRA) endorses the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC) resolution to eliminate regulatory barriers to the broad implementation of advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). The resolution, passed in February 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naruc.org/Resolutions/res.to.remove.regulatory.barriers.to.the.broad.implementation.of.advanced.metering.infrastructure.pdf Resolution to Remove Regulatory Barriers To the Broad Implementation of Advanced Metering Infrastructure] (from [http://www.naruc.org/resolutions.cfm?action=doit&amp;AdoptedDate=2007-02-21&amp;committeeID=50&amp;criteria= NARUC Committee on Energy Resources and the Environment Resolutions of 2007-02-21])&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledged the role of AMI in supporting the implementation of dynamic pricing and the resulting benefits to consumers. The resolution further identified the value of AMI in achieving significant utility operational cost savings in the areas of outage management, revenue protection and asset management. The resolution also called for AMI business case analysis to identify cost-effective deployment strategies, endorsed timely cost recovery for prudently incurred AMI expenditures and made additional recommendations on rate making and tax treatment of such investments.

===Benefits of advanced metering===
Advanced metering systems can provide benefits for utilities, retail providers and customers. Benefits will be recognized by the utilities with increased efficiencies, outage detection, tamper notification and reduced labor cost as a result of automating reads, connections and disconnects. Retail providers will be able to offer new innovative products in addition to customizing packages for their customers.  In addition, with the meter data being readily available, more flexible billing cycles would be available to their customers instead of following the standard utility read cycles.  With timely usage information available to the customer, benefits will be seen through opportunities to manage their energy consumption and change from one REP to another with actual meter data. Because of these benefits, many utilities are moving towards implementing some types of AMR solutions.

In many cases, smart metering is required by law (e.g. Pennsylvania's Act 129 (2008)).

===Disadvantages of advanced metering===

* Risk of loss of privacy &amp;mdash; details of use reveal information about user activities&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/energy/the-smarter-grid/privacy-on-the-smart-grid Privacy on the Smart Grid]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Greater potential for monitoring by other/unauthorized third parties&lt;ref name=ieee /&gt;
* Potentially reduced reliability (more complicated meters, more potential for interference by third parties)&lt;ref name=ieee /&gt;
* Increased security risks from network or remote access&lt;ref name=ieee /&gt;

=== Notable deployments ===
Construction practices, weather, and the need for information drive utilities in different parts of the world towards AMR at different rates. In the US, there have been significant fixed network deployments of both RF based and PLC based technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pplelectric.com/NR/rdonlyres/202A6200-A8EE-4433-9FDA-0DA738570592/0/StatementofReasons.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715111206/http://www.pplelectric.com/NR/rdonlyres/202A6200-A8EE-4433-9FDA-0DA738570592/0/StatementofReasons.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }} PPL 1.3 million residential and commercial electric meters&lt;/ref&gt; Some countries have either deployed or plan to deploy&lt;ref&gt;[http://tdworld.com/customer_service/power_swedish_utility_amr/] Sweden, (Vattenfall) 850k meters&lt;/ref&gt; AMR systems throughout the entire country.

==== SPAR ====
By using a combination of AMR and energy analytics reports, [[Spar (retailer)|SPAR]] were able to reduce energy consumption by 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.stark.co.uk/resources/case-studies/spar/|title=SPAR - Stark's energy management helps exceed cost reduction targets - Stark|work=Stark|access-date=2018-04-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Australia ====
AMI in Australia has grown from both government policy which sought to rectify observed market inefficiencies, and distribution businesses who looked to gain operational efficiencies.  In July 2008, there was a mandated program being planned in Victoria for the deployment of 2.6 million meters over a 4-year period.  The anticipated peak installation rate of AMI meters was 5,000 per day across Victoria.  The program governance was provided by an industry steering committee.

In 2009 the Victorian Auditor General undertook a review of the program and found that there were "significant inadequacies" in advice to Government and that project governance "has not been appropriate".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itnews.com.au/News/160398,auditor-general-slams-victorian-smart-meters.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  The Victorian government subsequently announced a moratorium of the program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/newsroom/9853.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100810042218/http://www.premier.vic.gov.au/newsroom/9853.html |archivedate=2010-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Black Girls Code''' ('''BGC''') is a not-for-profit organization that focuses on providing technology education for [[African-American]] girls. [[Kimberly Bryant (technologist)|Kimberly Bryant]], an [[electrical engineer]] who had worked in [[biotech]] for over 20 years, founded Black Girls Code in 2011 to rectify the underrepresentation of female African-Americans in the technology industry.&lt;ref name="Robehmed"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2013/08/30/black-girls-code-tackles-tech-inclusion/|title=Black Girls Code Tackles Tech Inclusion|last=Robehmed|first=Natalie|date=August 30, 2013|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilpin" /&gt; The organization offers programs in computer programming, coding, as well as website, robot, and mobile application-building, with the goal of providing African-American youth with the skills to occupy some of the 1.4 million computing job openings expected to be available in the U.S. in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/btn_02272013web.pdf |title=By the Numbers |website=www.ncwit.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==
Bryant was inspired to start BGC after her [[gamer]] daughter, Kai, attended a computing summer camp and was disappointed in the experience.&lt;ref name="Gilpin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techrepublic.com/article/black-girls-code-founder-kimberly-bryant-engineer-entrepreneur-mother/#.|title=Black Girls Code founder Kimberly Bryant: Engineer.

She also noted that the boys at the camp were given much more attention from the counselors than the few girls there.&lt;ref name="Gilpin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SFNews" /&gt; In an interview with [[Ebony (magazine)|''Ebony'']], Bryant stated, "I wanted to find a way to engage and interest my daughter in becoming a [[digital creative]] instead of just a consumer, and I did not find other programs that were targeted to girls like her from underrepresented communities."&lt;ref name="Phanor-Faury"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebony.com/life/black-girls-code-founder-kim-bryant-talks-333#axzz2z0qE3OOB|title=Black Girls Code’s Kim Bryant Talks Bits and Bytes|last=Phanor-Faury|first=Alexandra|date=March 19, 2014|work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
BGC has become a rapidly growing phenomenon, quickly expanding in the USA and abroad. Headquartered in [[Bayview-Hunters Point, San Francisco]], the organization grew to 2,000 students by August 2013 within the 7 established institutions &lt;ref name="Robehmed" /&gt; operating in 7 States across the US, as well as in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Ntim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lottie-ntim/when-black-girls-code_b_4427516.html|title=When Black Girls Code|last=Ntim|first=Lottie|date=December 12, 2013|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; BGC seeks to double their reach by adding chapters in the US and Africa over the next two years.&lt;ref name="D'Ignazio"&gt;{{cite web | last=D'Ignazio |first=Catherine |title=Kimberly Bryant and Black Girls Code | date=November 18, 2013|work=MIT Center for Civic Media| accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; BGC also hosts bilingual workshops in partnership with Latino Startup Alliance.&lt;ref name="Gilpin" /&gt; BGC's ultimate goal is "to grow to train 1 million girls by 2050 and become the 'girl scouts' of technology." &lt;ref name="D'Ignazio" /&gt; 

BGC depends on a vast body of [[volunteering|volunteers]] to design and conduct workshop classes. Professionals from the IT sector share their expertise with the young students, helping them get acquainted with the fundamentals of software design in languages such as [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]] or [[Ruby on Rails]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackgirlscode.com/what-we-do.html|title=What We Do|website=Black Girls Code   imagine. build. create.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After school activities are alternated with day-long workshops; an extended course is held during the summer. 

BGC primarily relies on donations to fund its activities; 75% students are currently on scholarships.&lt;ref name="Robehmed" /&gt; 

The motto of the Black Girls Code is: "Imagine. Build. Create. – Imagine a world where everyone is given the tools to succeed, and then help us build ways for everyone to access information and create a new age of women of color in technology".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt;

==Awards and grants==
Black Girls Code received a $50,000 grant from [[Microsoft Azure|Microsoft's Azure development]] (AzureDev) community campaign in January 2014.&lt;ref name="Frank"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geekwire.com/2014/black-girls-code-code-org-among-named-azuredev-grant-winners/|title=Black Girls Code, Code.org win Microsoft AzureDev grants|last=Frank|first=Blair Hanley|date=January 15, 2014|work=[[Geekwire]]|accessdate=April 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:blending inheritance.svg|thumb|upright=2|Flowers would converge to a single coloration in a few generations if [[inheritance (biology)|inheritance]] blended the characteristics of the two parents.]]
'''Blending inheritance''' is an [[Superseded scientific theories|obsolete theory]] in [[biology]] from the 19th century. The theory is that the progeny [[inheritance (biology)|inherits]] any characteristic as the average of the parents' values of that characteristic. As an example of this a crossing of a red flower variety with a white variety of the same [[species]] would yield pink-flowered offspring.

[[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of inheritance by [[pangenesis]], with contributions to egg or sperm from every part of the body, implied blending inheritance. His reliance on this mechanism led [[Fleeming Jenkin]] to attack [[natural selection]] on the grounds that blending inheritance would average out any novel beneficial characteristic before selection had time to act.

Blending inheritance was discarded with the general acceptance of particulate [[Mendelian inheritance]] during the development of modern [[genetics]] after 1900.

==History==
{{further|The eclipse of Darwinism|modern synthesis (20th century)}}
[[File:Darwin's Pangenesis.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Diagram of [[Charles Darwin]]'s pangenesis theory. Every part of the body emits tiny particles, [[Gemmule (pangenesis)|gemmules]], which migrate to the [[gonad]]s and contribute to the fertilised egg and so to the next generation. The theory implied that changes to the body during an organism's life would be inherited, as proposed in [[Lamarckism]], and that [[inheritance (biology)|inheritance]] would be blending.]]

===Darwin's pangenesis===
{{further|Pangenesis}}

[[Charles Darwin]] developed his theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]] on the basis of an understanding of [[uniformitarianism|uniform processes]] in [[geology]], acting over very long periods of time on inheritable variation within populations. One of those processes was competition for resources, as [[Thomas Malthus]] had indicated, leading to a struggle to survive and to reproduce. Since some individuals would by chance have traits that allowed them to leave more offspring, those traits would tend to increase in the population. Darwin assembled many lines of evidence to show that variation occurred and that [[artificial selection]] by animal and plant breeding had caused change. All of this demanded a reliable mechanism of [[inheritance (biology)|inheritance]].&lt;ref name=Dawkins&gt;{{cite news |title=An early flowering of genetics |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/feb/08/peopleinscience.evolution |author=Dawkins, Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |agency=[[The Guardian]] |date=8 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pangenesis]] was Darwin's attempt to provide such a mechanism of inheritance. The idea was that each part of the parent's body emitted tiny particles called [[Gemmule (pangenesis)|gemmules]], which migrated through the body to contribute to that parent's [[gamete]]s, their eggs or sperms. The theory had an intuitive appeal, as characteristics of all parts of the body, such as shape of nose, width of shoulders and length of legs are inherited from both the father and the mother. However, it had some serious weaknesses. Firstly, many characteristics can change during an individual's lifetime, and are affected by the environment: [[blacksmith]]s can develop strong arm muscles during their work, so the gemmules from these muscles ought to carry this acquired characteristic. That implies the [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]]. Secondly, the fact that the gemmules were supposed to mix together on [[fertilisation]] implies blending inheritance, namely that the offspring would all be intermediate between the father and the mother in every characteristic. That directly contradicts the observed facts of inheritance, not least that children are usually either male or female rather than all [[intersex]], and that traits such as flower colour often re-emerge after a generation, even when they seem to disappear when two varieties are crossed.&lt;ref name=Dawkins/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holterhoff2014&gt;{{cite journal |author=Holterhoff, Kate |date=2014 |title=The History and Reception of Charles Darwin's Hypothesis of Pangenesis |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=47 |pages=661–695 |doi=10.1007/s10739-014-9377-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Darwin1868&gt;{{cite book | last=Darwin | first=Charles | year=1868 | title=The variation of animals and plants under domestication | publication-place=London | publisher=John Murray | url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F880.1&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 | isbn=1-4191-8660-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin was aware of both these objections, and accordingly had strong doubts about blending inheritance, as evidenced in his private correspondence. In a letter to [[T.H. Huxley]], dated November 12, 1857, Darwin wrote:

{{quote|I have lately been inclined to speculate very crudely &amp; indistinctly, that propagation by true fertilisation, will turn out to be a sort of mixture &amp; not true fusion, of two distinct individuals, or rather of innumerable individuals, as each parent has its parents &amp; ancestors:— I can understand on no other view the way in which crossed forms go back to so large an extent to ancestral forms."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-2166 Darwin Correspondence Project, Letter #2166 -- Darwin C. R. to Huxley, T. H. dated before 12 Nov 1857]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Blending Inheritance.svg|thumb|Blending inheritance leads to the averaging out of every characteristic, which as the engineer [[Fleeming Jenkin]] pointed out, would make natural selection impossible if blending were the mechanism of inheritance.&lt;ref name=Dawkins/&gt;{{sfn|Bowler|1983|pp=23–26, 196–253}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=105–129}}]]

In a letter to [[Alfred Wallace]], dated February 6, 1866, Darwin mentioned conducting hybridization experiments with pea plants, not unlike those done by [[Gregor Mendel]], and like him obtaining [[Mendel's law of segregation|segregating]] (unblended) varieties, effectively disproving his theory of pangenesis with blending:

{{quote|I do not think you understand what I mean by the non-blending of certain varieties. It does not refer to fertility; an instance I will explain. I crossed the Painted Lady and Purple [[sweetpea]]s, which are very differently coloured varieties, and got, even out of the same pod, both varieties perfect but not intermediate. Something of this kind I should think must occur at least with your butterflies &amp; the three forms of ''[[Lythrum]]''; tho’ those cases are in appearance so wonderful. I do not know that they are really more so than every female in the world producing distinct male and female offspring...&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-4989 Darwin Correspondence Project, Letter #4989 -- Darwin, C. R. to Wallace A. R. dated 6 Feb 1866]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Blending inheritance was also clearly incompatible with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. The engineer [[Fleeming Jenkin]] used this to attack natural selection in his 1867 review of Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. Jenkin noted, correctly, that if inheritance were by blending, any beneficial trait that might arise in a lineage would have "blended away" long before natural selection had time to act.&lt;ref name=Dawkins/&gt;{{sfn|Bowler|1983|pp=23–26, 196–253}}{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=105–129}} The evolutionary biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] commented that blending inheritance was observably wrong, as it implied that every generation would be more uniform than the one before, and that Darwin should have said as much to Jenkin. The problem was not with natural selection, but with blending, and in Dawkins's view, Darwin should have settled for saying that the mechanism of inheritance was unknown, but certainly non-blending.&lt;ref name=Dawkins/&gt;

===Replacement by Mendelian inheritance===
&lt;!--[[File:Weismann's Germ Plasm.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|[[August Weismann]]'s [[germ plasm]] theory. The hereditary material, the germ plasm, is confined to the [[gonad]]s and the [[gamete]]s. Somatic cells (of the body) [[embryology|develop]] afresh in each generation from the germ plasm. There is no [[inheritance of acquired characteristics|influence from acquired characteristics]], and no blending.]]--&gt;
[[File:Punnett square mendel flowers.svg|thumb|right|A [[Punnett square]] for one of Mendel's pea plant experiments - self-fertilization of the F1 generation, shows that inheritance is [[particulate inheritance|particulate]], not blending.]]
{{further|Mendelian inheritance|Germ plasm}}

Blending inheritance was dismissed by the eventual widespread acceptance, after his death, of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s theory of [[particulate inheritance]], which he had presented in ''[[Experiments on Plant Hybridization]]'' (1865).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Gregor Mendel |author=Mendel, J. G. |year=1866 |title="Versuche über Pflanzenhybriden" |journal=Verhandlungen des naturforschenden Vereines in Brünn |volume=4 (1865) |pages=3–47 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/124139#page/133/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Druery |first1=C.

In Weismann's view, the germ plasm formed the body, but the body did not influence the germ plasm, except indirectly by natural selection. This contradicted both Darwin's pangenesis and Lamarckian inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Weismann, August |authorlink=August Weismann |date=1892 |title=Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung |publisher=Fischer |location=Jena |url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_f5U-AAAAYAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=247–253, 257}} Mendel's work was rediscovered in 1900 by the geneticist [[Hugo de Vries]] and others, soon confirmed that same year by experiments by [[William Bateson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jic.ac.uk/germplas/PISUM/ZGS4F.HTM |title=Mendel's Peas |last=Ambrose |first=Mike |publisher=Germplasm Resources Unit, [[John Innes Centre]]|location=Norwich, UK |accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mendelian inheritance with segregating, particulate [[allele]]s came to be understood as the explanation for both discrete and continuously varying characteristics.{{sfn|Larson|2004|pp=157–166, 221–243}}{{sfn|Bowler|1989|pp=275–276}}{{efn|Blending inheritance has sometimes been wrongly identified with the continuous inheritance advocated by the [[biometrics|biometricians]] at the start of the 20th century.

[[File:Boeing 737 fuselage train hull 3473.jpg|thumb|An airliner fuselage, such as this [[Boeing 737]], forms a cylindrical [[pressure vessel]]]]

'''Cabin pressurization''' is a process in which conditioned air is pumped into the [[aircraft cabin|cabin]] of an aircraft or [[spacecraft]], in order to create a safe and comfortable environment for passengers and crew flying at high altitudes. For aircraft, this air is usually [[Bleed air|bled off]] from the [[gas turbine|gas turbine engines]] at the compressor stage, and for spacecraft, it is carried in high-pressure, often [[liquid oxygen|cryogenic]] tanks. The air is cooled, humidified, and mixed with recirculated air if necessary, before it is distributed to the cabin by one or more [[Environmental control system (aircraft)|environmental control systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2011/04/12/how-airplane-cabin-pressurization-works-keeping-you-comfortable-in-the-death-zone-at-33000-feet/ | title=How Airplane Cabin Pressurization Works | publisher=How Stuff Works | date=April 12, 2011 | accessdate=December 31, 2012 | author=Brain, Marshall | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115141028/http://blogs.howstuffworks.com/2011/04/12/how-airplane-cabin-pressurization-works-keeping-you-comfortable-in-the-death-zone-at-33000-feet/ | archivedate=January 15, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cabin pressure is regulated by the outflow valve.

==Need for cabin pressurization==
[[File:Pxctl.jpg|upright|thumbnail|right|The pressurization controls on a [[Boeing 737-800]]]]

Pressurization becomes increasingly necessary at altitudes above {{convert|10000|ft|m}} above [[sea level]] to protect crew and passengers from the risk of a number of physiological problems caused by the low outside air pressure above that altitude. For private aircraft operating in the US, crew members are required to use oxygen masks if the cabin altitude stays above 12,500&amp;nbsp;ft for more than 30 minutes, or if the cabin altitude reaches 14,000&amp;nbsp;ft at any time. At altitudes above 15,000&amp;nbsp;ft, passengers are required to be provided oxygen masks as well. On commercial aircraft, the cabin altitude must be maintained at 8,000&amp;nbsp;ft or less. Pressurization of the cargo hold is also required to prevent damage to pressure-sensitive goods that might leak, expand, burst or be crushed on re-pressurization. The principal physiological problems are listed below.

; [[Hypoxia (medical)|Hypoxia]]
: The lower [[partial pressure]] of oxygen at altitude reduces the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] oxygen tension in the lungs and subsequently in the brain, leading to sluggish thinking, dimmed vision, loss of consciousness, and ultimately death. In some individuals, particularly those with heart or lung disease, symptoms may begin as low as {{convert|5000|ft|m}}, although most passengers can tolerate altitudes of {{convert|8000|ft|m}} without ill effect. At this altitude, there is about 25% less oxygen than there is at sea level.&lt;ref name="02_calc"&gt;{{cite web | author=K. Baillie and A. Simpson | title=Altitude oxygen calculator | url=http://www.altitude.org/air_pressure.php | accessdate=2006-08-13}} – Online interactive altitude oxygen calculator&lt;/ref&gt;
: Hypoxia may be addressed by the administration of supplemental oxygen, either through an [[oxygen mask]] or through a [[nasal cannula]]. Without pressurization, sufficient oxygen can be delivered up to an altitude of about {{convert|40000|ft|m}}. This is because a person who is used to living at sea level needs about 0.20&amp;nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|bar]] [[Partial pressure of oxygen|partial oxygen pressure]] to function normally and that pressure can be maintained up to about {{convert|40000|ft|m}} by increasing the [[mole fraction]] of oxygen in the air that is being breathed. At {{convert|40000|ft|m}}, the ambient air pressure falls to about 0.2 bar, at which maintaining a minimum partial pressure of oxygen of 0.2 bar requires breathing 100% oxygen using an [[oxygen mask]].
: Emergency oxygen supply masks in the passenger compartment of airliners do not need to be [[oxygen masks|pressure-demand masks]] because most flights stay below {{convert|40000|ft|m}}. Above that altitude the partial pressure of oxygen will fall below 0.2 bar even at 100% oxygen and some degree of cabin pressurization or rapid descent will be essential to avoid the risk of hypoxia.
; [[Altitude sickness]]
: [[Hyperventilation]], the body's most common response to hypoxia, does help to partially restore the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood, but it also causes [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to out-gas, raising the blood pH and inducing [[alkalosis]]. Passengers may experience fatigue, [[nausea]], headaches, sleeplessness, and (on extended flights) even [[pulmonary oedema]]. These are the same symptoms that mountain climbers experience, but the limited duration of powered flight makes the development of pulmonary oedema unlikely. Altitude sickness may be controlled by a full [[pressure suit]] with helmet and faceplate, which completely envelops the body in a pressurized environment; however, this is impractical for commercial passengers.
; [[Decompression sickness]]
: The low partial pressure of gases, principally nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) but including all other gases, may cause dissolved gases in the bloodstream to precipitate out, resulting in ''gas embolism'', or bubbles in the bloodstream. The mechanism is the same as that of compressed-air divers on ascent from depth. Symptoms may include the early symptoms of "the bends"—tiredness, forgetfulness, headache, stroke, thrombosis, and subcutaneous itching—but rarely the full symptoms thereof. Decompression sickness may also be controlled by a full-pressure suit as for altitude sickness.
; [[Barotrauma]]
: As the aircraft climbs or descends, passengers may experience discomfort or acute pain as gases trapped within their bodies expand or contract. The most common problems occur with air trapped in the [[middle ear]] (aerotitus) or paranasal sinuses by a blocked [[Eustachian tube]] or sinuses. Pain may also be experienced in the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] or even the teeth ([[barodontalgia]]). Usually these are not severe enough to cause actual trauma but can result in soreness in the ear that persists after the flight and can exacerbate or precipitate pre-existing medical conditions, such as [[pneumothorax]].

==Cabin altitude==
[[File:CabinAltitudeQF744.jpg|thumb|An empty bottle, sealed at 37,000ft, is crushed on descent to sea level, compared with one in its original state.]]
The pressure inside the cabin is technically referred to as the ''equivalent effective cabin altitude'' or more commonly as the ''cabin altitude''. This is defined as the equivalent altitude above [[sea level|mean sea level]] having the same [[atmospheric pressure]] according to a standard atmospheric model such as the [[International Standard Atmosphere]]. Thus a cabin altitude of zero would have the pressure found at mean sea level, which is taken to be {{convert|101.325|kPa|psi|sigfig=5}}.&lt;ref name="aeromech.usyd.edu.au"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Auld | first = D. J. | last2 = Srinivas | first2 = K. | title = Properties of the Atmosphere | date = 2008 | url = http://www.aeromech.usyd.edu.au/aero/atmosphere/ | accessdate = 2008-03-13 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130609091708/http://www.aeromech.usyd.edu.au/aero/atmosphere/ | archive-date = 2013-06-09 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aircraft===
In [[airliner]]s, cabin altitude during flight is kept above sea level in order to reduce stress on the pressurized part of the [[fuselage]]; this stress is proportional to the difference in pressure inside and outside the cabin. In a typical commercial passenger flight, the cabin altitude is programmed to rise gradually from the altitude of the airport of origin to a regulatory maximum of {{convert|8000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. This cabin altitude is maintained while the aircraft is cruising at its maximum altitude and then reduced gradually during descent until the cabin pressure matches the ambient air pressure at the destination.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Keeping the cabin altitude below {{convert|8000|ft|m|abbr=on}} generally prevents significant [[Hypoxic hypoxia|hypoxia]], [[altitude sickness]], [[decompression sickness]], and [[barotrauma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.iata.org/publications/Documents/medical-manual.pdf |title=Medical Manual 9th Edition| ISBN =978-92-9229-445-8 |publisher=International Air Transport Association.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) regulations in the U.S. mandate that under normal operating conditions, the cabin altitude may not exceed this limit at the maximum operating altitude of the aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1790988|title=Commercial aircraft cabin altitude|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|volume=100|issue=2|page=64|author=Bagshaw M|year=2007|doi=10.1258/jrsm.100.2.64-a}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mandatory maximum cabin altitude does not eliminate all physiological problems; passengers with conditions such as [[pneumothorax]] are advised not to fly until fully healed, and people suffering from a cold or other infection may still experience pain in the ears and sinuses.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The rate of change of cabin altitude strongly affects comfort as humans are sensitive to pressure changes in the [[inner ear]] and [[Paranasal sinuses|sinuses]] and this has to be managed carefully. [[Scuba diving|Scuba]] divers flying within the "no fly" period after a dive are at risk of [[decompression sickness]] because the accumulated nitrogen in their bodies can form bubbles when exposed to reduced cabin pressure.

The cabin altitude of the [[Boeing 767]] is typically about {{convert|7000|ft|m}} when cruising at {{convert|37000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boeing.com/commercial/cabinair/ecs.pdf|title=Commercial Airliner Environmental Control System: Engineering Aspects of Cabin Air Quality|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524110211/http://www.boeing.com/commercial/cabinair/ecs.pdf|archivedate=2011-05-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is typical for older jet airliners. A design goal for many, but not all, newer aircraft is to provide a lower cabin altitude than older designs. This can be beneficial for passenger comfort.&lt;ref name="flightglobal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/in-focus-manufacturers-aim-for-more-comfortable-cabin-climate-369425/|title=Manufacturers aim for more comfortable cabin climate|publisher=Flightglobal|date=19 Mar 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Bombardier Global Express]] business jet can provide a cabin altitude of {{convert|4500|ft|m|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} when cruising at {{convert|41000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=xrs&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aero-news.net/index.cfm?do=main.textpost&amp;id=293b270c-653f-4b6a-84b8-e3f9b4754dc5 |title=Bombardier's Stretching Range on Global Express Global Express XRS|work=Aero-News Network |date=October 7, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bombardier&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.bombardier.com/en/3_0/3_2/pdf/global_express_xrs_factsheet.pdf|title=Bombardier Global Express XRS Factsheet|publisher=Bombardier|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ecs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srs.aero/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AERO-4003-ECS-Lecture-Final.pdf|title=Aircraft Environmental Control Systems|publisher=Carleton University|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Emivest SJ30]] business jet can provide a sea-level cabin altitude when cruising at {{convert|41000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/flight-test-emivest-sj30-long-range-rocket-333285/ Flight Test: Emivest SJ30 – Long-range rocket] Retrieved 27 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerospace-technology.com/projects/sj30-2/ SJ30-2, United States of America] Retrieved 27 September 2012.{{Unreliable source?|reason=domain on WP:BLACKLIST|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study of 8 flights in [[Airbus A380]] aircraft found a median cabin pressure altitude of {{convert|6128|ft|m}}, and 65 flights in [[Boeing 747-400]] aircraft found a median cabin pressure altitude of {{convert|5159|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=ers&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ersnet.org/index.php?option=com_flexicontent&amp;view=items&amp;id=4106:airlines-are-cu |title=Airlines are cutting costs – Are patients with respiratory diseases paying the price?|work=European Respiratory Society |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1996, approximately 6,000 large commercial transport airplanes were type-certificated to fly up to {{convert|45000|ft|m|abbr=on}} without having to meet high-altitude special conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgPolicy.nsf/0/90AA20C2F35901D98625713F0056B1B8?OpenDocument|title=Final Policy FAR Part 25 Sec. 25.841 07/05/1996&amp;#124;Attachment 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the FAA adopted Amendment 25-87, which imposed additional high-altitude cabin pressure specifications for new-type aircraft designs. Aircraft certified to operate above {{convert|25000|ft|m|abbr=on}} "must be designed so that occupants will not be exposed to cabin pressure altitudes in excess of {{convert|15000|ft|m|abbr=on}} after any probable failure condition in the pressurization system".&lt;ref name="FARs, 14 CFR, Part 25, Section 841"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightsimaviation.com/data/FARS/part_25-841.html|title=FARs, 14 CFR, Part 25, Section 841}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event of a decompression that results from "any failure condition not shown to be extremely improbable", the plane must be designed such that occupants will not be exposed to a cabin altitude exceeding {{convert|25000|ft|m|abbr=on}} for more than 2 minutes, nor to an altitude exceeding {{convert|40000|ft|m|abbr=on}} at any time.&lt;ref name="FARs, 14 CFR, Part 25, Section 841"/&gt; In practice, that new [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] amendment imposes an operational [[Ceiling (aeronautics)|ceiling]] of {{convert|40000|ft|m|abbr=on}} on the majority of newly designed commercial aircraft.&lt;ref name="Exemption No. 8695"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgEX.nsf/0/9929ce16709cad0f8625713f00551e74/$FILE/8695.doc|title=Exemption No. 8695|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Authority]]|date=2006-03-24|location=Renton, Washington|accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library%5CrgPolicy.nsf/0/90AA20C2F35901D98625713F0056B1B8?OpenDocument|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Authority]]|date=2006-03-24|title=PS-ANM-03-112-16|accessdate=2009-09-23|author=Steve Happenny}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aircraft manufacturers can apply for a relaxation of this rule if the circumstances warrant it. In 2004, [[Airbus]] acquired an FAA exemption to allow the cabin altitude of the A380 to reach {{Convert|43,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} in the event of a decompression incident and to exceed {{Convert|40,000|ft|m|abbr=on}} for one minute. This allows the A380 to operate at a higher altitude than other newly designed civilian aircraft.&lt;ref name="Exemption No. 8695"/&gt;

===Spacecraft===
Russian engineers used an air-like nitrogen/oxygen mixture, kept at a cabin altitude near zero at all times, in their 1961 [[Vostok (spacecraft)|Vostok]], 1964 [[Voskhod (spacecraft)|Voskhod]], and 1967 to present [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; This requires a heavier [[space vehicle]] design, because the spacecraft cabin structure must withstand the stress of 14.7 pounds per square inch (1 bar) against the vacuum of space, and also because an inert nitrogen mass must be carried. Care must also be taken to avoid [[decompression sickness]] when cosmonauts perform [[extravehicular activity]], as current soft [[space suit]]s are pressurized with pure oxygen at relatively low pressure in order to provide reasonable flexibility.&lt;ref&gt;Gatland, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, the United States used a pure oxygen atmosphere for its 1961 [[Project Mercury|Mercury]], 1965 [[Project Gemini|Gemini]], and 1967 [[Apollo spacecraft|Apollo]] spacecraft, mainly in order to avoid decompression sickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Catchpole|first=John|title=Project Mercury – NASA's First Manned Space Programme|year=2001|publisher=Springer Praxis|location=Chichester, UK|isbn=1-85233-406-1|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Giblin |first=Kelly A. |date=Spring 1998 |title ='Fire in the Cockpit!' |journal=[[American Heritage of Invention &amp; Technology]] |volume=13 |issue=4 |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1998/4/1998_4_46.shtml |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120153024/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1998/4/1998_4_46.shtml |archivedate=November 20, 2008 |accessdate=March 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury used a cabin altitude of {{convert|24800|ft|m}} ({{convert|5.5|psi|bar}});&lt;ref&gt;Gatland, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; Gemini used an altitude of {{convert|25700|ft|m}} ({{convert|5.3|psi|bar|abbr=on}});&lt;ref&gt;Gatland, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; and Apollo used {{convert|27,000|ft|m}} ({{convert|5.0|psi|bar|abbr=on}})&lt;ref&gt;Gatland, p. 278, 284&lt;/ref&gt; in space. This allowed for a lighter space vehicle design. Before launch, the pressure was kept at slightly higher than sea level at a constant {{convert|5.3|psi|bar|abbr=on}} above ambient for Gemini, and {{convert|2|psi|bar|abbr=on}} above sea level at launch for Apollo), and transitioned to the space cabin altitude during ascent. However, the high pressure pure oxygen atmosphere proved to be a fatal fire hazard in Apollo, contributing to the deaths of the entire crew of [[Apollo 1]] during a 1967 ground test. After this, [[NASA]] revised its procedure to use a 40% nitrogen/60% oxygen mix at zero cabin altitude at launch, but kept the low-pressure pure oxygen in space.{{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

After the [[Apollo program]], the United States used air-like cabin atmospheres{{clarify|date=December 2015}} for [[Skylab]], the [[Space Shuttle orbiter]], and the [[International Space Station]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Mechanics==
Pressurization is achieved by the design of an airtight fuselage engineered to be pressurized with a source of compressed air and controlled by an [[environmental control system]] (ECS). The most common source of compressed air for pressurization is [[bleed air]] extracted from the compressor stage of a [[gas turbine]] engine, from a low or intermediate stage and also from an additional high stage; the exact stage can vary depending on engine type. By the time the cold outside air has reached the bleed air valves, it is at a very high pressure and has been heated to around {{convert|200|°C|°F|abbr=on|lk=on}}. The control and selection of high or low bleed sources is fully automatic and is governed by the needs of various pneumatic systems at various stages of flight.&lt;ref name="Engineering Aspects of Cabin Air"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cabinfiles.com/?CFrequest=file;03032001100119 |title=Commercial Airliner Environmental Control System: Engineering Aspects of Cabin Air |dead-url=yes |format=PDF |year=1995 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331055732/http://www.cabinfiles.com/?CFrequest=file%3B03032001100119 |archivedate=31 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The part of the bleed air that is directed to the ECS is then expanded to bring it to cabin pressure, which cools it. A final, suitable temperature is then achieved by adding back heat from the hot compressed air via a [[heat exchanger]] and [[air cycle machine]] known as the packs system. In some larger airliners, hot trim air can be added downstream of air conditioned air coming from the packs if it is needed to warm a section of the cabin that is colder than others.

[[File:Outflow.jpg|thumb|left|Outflow and pressure relief valve on a [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737-800]]]]
At least two engines provide compressed bleed air for all the plane's pneumatic systems, to provide full [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]]. Compressed air is also obtained from the [[auxiliary power unit]] (APU), if fitted, in the event of an emergency and for cabin air supply on the ground before the main engines are started. Most modern commercial aircraft today have fully redundant, duplicated electronic controllers for maintaining pressurization along with a manual back-up control system.

All exhaust air is dumped to atmosphere via an outflow valve, usually at the rear of the fuselage. This valve controls the cabin pressure and also acts as a safety relief valve, in addition to other safety relief valves. If the automatic pressure controllers fail, the pilot can manually control the cabin pressure valve, according to the backup emergency procedure checklist. The automatic controller normally maintains the proper cabin pressure altitude by constantly adjusting the outflow valve position so that the cabin altitude is as low as practical without exceeding the maximum pressure differential limit on the fuselage. The pressure differential varies between aircraft types, typical values are between {{convert|7.8|psi|kPa|abbr=on|lk=on}} and {{convert|9.4|psi|kPa|abbr=on|lk=on}}.&lt;ref name="Differential Pressure Characteristics of Aircraft"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mrcabinpressure.com/aircraft.htm|title=Differential Pressure Characteristics of Aircraft}}&lt;/ref&gt; At {{convert|39000|ft|m}}, the cabin pressure would be automatically maintained at about {{convert|6900|ft|m}} ({{convert|450|ft|m}} lower than Mexico City), which is about {{convert|11.5|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} of atmosphere pressure.&lt;ref name="Engineering Aspects of Cabin Air"/&gt;

Some aircraft, such as the [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]], have re-introduced electric compressors previously used on piston-engined airliners to provide pressurization.&lt;ref name="AERO_QTR_406_787_from_the_ground_up"&gt;[http://www.boeing.com/commercial/aeromagazine/articles/qtr_4_06/AERO_Q406_article4.pdf "Boeing 787 from the Ground Up"]&lt;/ref&gt; The use of electric compressors increases the electrical generation load on the engines and introduces a number of stages of energy transfer; therefore, it is unclear whether this increases the overall efficiency of the aircraft air handling system. It does, however, remove the danger of [[Fume event|chemical contamination of the cabin]], simplify engine design, avert the need to run high pressure pipework around the aircraft, and provide greater design flexibility.

==Unplanned decompression==
{{Main|Uncontrolled decompression}}
[[File:Passenger oxygen mask dsc06035.jpg|thumb|upright|Passenger oxygen mask deployment]]

Unplanned loss of cabin pressure at altitude is rare but has resulted in a [[Uncontrolled decompression#Notable decompression accidents and incidents|number of fatal accidents]]. Failures range from sudden, catastrophic loss of airframe integrity (explosive decompression) to slow leaks or equipment malfunctions that allow cabin pressure to drop undetected to levels that can lead to unconsciousness or severe performance degradation of the aircrew.

Any failure of cabin pressurization above {{convert|10000|ft|m}} requires an emergency descent to {{convert|8000|ft|m}} or the closest to that while maintaining the Minimum Safe Altitude (MSA), and the deployment of an [[oxygen mask]] for each seat. The oxygen systems have sufficient oxygen for all on board and give the pilots adequate time to descend to below {{convert|8000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Without emergency oxygen, [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] may lead to loss of consciousness and a subsequent loss of control of the aircraft. The [[time of useful consciousness]] varies according to altitude. As the pressure falls the cabin air temperature may also plummet to the ambient outside temperature with a danger of [[hypothermia]] or [[frostbite]].

In [[jet fighter]] aircraft, the small size of the [[cockpit]] means that any decompression will be very rapid and would not allow the pilot time to put on an oxygen mask. Therefore, fighter jet pilots and aircrew are required to wear oxygen masks at all times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goflightmedicine.com/hypoxia/ |title=Hypoxia |last1=Jedick MD/MBA |first1=Rocky |last2= |first2= |date=28 April 2013 |website=goflightmedicine.com |publisher=Go Flight Medicine |accessdate=17 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 30, 1971, the crew of [[Soyuz 11]], Soviet cosmonauts [[Georgy Dobrovolsky]], [[Vladislav Volkov]], and [[Viktor Patsayev]] were killed after the cabin vent valve accidentally opened before atmospheric re-entry. There had been no indication of trouble until the recovery team opened the capsule and found the dead crew.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903011,00.html|title=Triumph and Tragedy of Soyuz 11|accessdate=20 October 2007|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=12 July 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ea"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/flights/soyuz11.htm|title=Soyuz 11|accessdate=20 October 2007|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|year=2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030215242/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/soyuz11.htm|archivedate=30 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The aircraft that pioneered pressurized cabin systems include:
* [[Packard-Le Père LUSAC-11]], (1920, a modified French design, not actually pressurized but with an enclosed, oxygen enriched cockpit)
* [[Engineering Division USD-9A]], a modified [[Airco DH.9A]] (1921 – the first aircraft to fly with the addition of a pressurized cockpit module)
* [[Junkers Ju 49]] (1931 – a German experimental aircraft purpose-built to test the concept of cabin pressurization)
* [[Farman F.1000]] (1932 – a French record breaking pressurized cockpit, experimental aircraft)
* [[Chizhevski BOK-1]] (1936 – a Russian experimental aircraft)
* [[Lockheed XC-35]] (1937 – an American pressurized aircraft. Rather than a pressure capsule enclosing the cockpit, the [[monocoque]] fuselage skin was the pressure vessel.)
* [[Renard R.35]] (1938 – the first pressurized piston airliner, which crashed on first flight)
* [[Boeing 307]] (1938 – the first pressurized airliner to enter commercial service)
* [[Lockheed Constellation]] (1943 – the first pressurized airliner in wide service)
* [[Avro Tudor]] (1946 – first British pressurized airliner)
* [[de Havilland Comet]] (British, Comet 1 1949 – the first jetliner, Comet 4 1958 – resolving the Comet 1 problems)
* [[Tupolev Tu-144]] and [[Concorde]] (1968 USSR and 1969 Anglo-French respectively – first to operate at very high altitude)
* [[SyberJet SJ30]] (2005) First civilian business jet to certify 12.0 psi pressurization system allowing for a sea level cabin at {{convert|41000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.

In the late 1910s, attempts were being made to achieve higher and higher altitudes. In 1920, flights well over {{convert|37000|ft|m|abbr=on}} were first achieved by test pilot Lt. [[John A. Macready]] in a [[Packard-Le Père LUSAC-11]] biplane at [[McCook Field]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cornelisse, Diana G.|title=Splended Vision, Unswerving Purpose; Developing Air Power for the United States Air Force During the First Century of Powered Flight|location=Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio|publisher=U.S. Air Force Publications|year=2002|isbn=0-16-067599-5|pages=128–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flight was possible by releasing stored oxygen into the cockpit, which was released directly into an enclosed cabin and not to an oxygen mask, which was developed later.&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"/&gt; With this system flights nearing {{convert|40000|ft|m|abbr=on}} were possible, but the lack of atmospheric pressure at that altitude caused the pilot's heart to enlarge visibly, and many pilots reported health problems from such high altitude flights.&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"/&gt; Some early airliners had oxygen masks for the passengers for routine flights.

In 1921, a Wright-Dayton USD-9A reconnaissance biplane was modified with the addition of a completely enclosed air-tight chamber that could be pressurized with air forced into it by small external turbines.&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"/&gt; The chamber had a hatch only {{convert|22|in|m|abbr=on}} in diameter that would be sealed by the pilot at {{convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"/&gt; The chamber contained only one instrument, an altimeter, while the conventional cockpit instruments were all mounted outside the chamber, visible through five small portholes.&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"/&gt; The first attempt to operate the aircraft was again made by Lt. John A. McCready, who discovered that the turbine was forcing air into the chamber faster than the small release valve provided could release it.&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"/&gt; As a result, the chamber quickly over pressurized, and the flight was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"/&gt; A second attempt had to be abandoned when the pilot discovered at {{convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}} that he was too short to close the chamber hatch.&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"/&gt; The first successful flight was finally made by test pilot Lt. Harrold Harris, making it the world's first flight by a pressurized aircraft.&lt;ref name="Cornelisse"/&gt;

The first airliner with a pressurized cabin was the [[Boeing 307]] Stratoliner, built in 1938, prior to [[World War II]], though only ten were produced. The 307's "pressure compartment was from the nose of the aircraft to a pressure [[Bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]] in the aft just forward of the horizontal stabilizer."&lt;ref&gt;William A. Schoneberger and Robert R. H. Scholl, ''Out of Thin Air: Garrett's First 50 Years'', Phoenix: Garrett Corporation, 1985 ({{ISBN|0-9617029-0-7}}), p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:B-8 winter helmet &amp; A-14 oxygen mask (1944).jpg|thumb|World War II era flying helmet and oxygen mask]]
World War II was a catalyst for aircraft development. Initially, the piston aircraft of World War II, though they often flew at very high altitudes, were not pressurized and relied on oxygen masks.&lt;ref&gt;Some extremely high flying aircraft such as the [[Westland Welkin]] used partial pressurization to reduce the effort of using an oxygen mask.&lt;/ref&gt; This became impractical with the development of larger bombers where crew were required to move about the cabin and this led to the first bomber with cabin pressurization (though restricted to crew areas), the [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]]. The control system for this was designed by [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett AiResearch Manufacturing Company]], drawing in part on licensing of patents held by Boeing for the Stratoliner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seymour L. Chapin |title=Garrett and Pressurized Flight: A Business Built on Thin Air |journal=Pacific Historical Review |volume=35 |issue= 3|pages=329–43 |date=August 1966 |doi=10.2307/3636792|jstor=3636792 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-war piston airliners such as the [[Lockheed Constellation]] (1943) extended the technology to civilian service. The piston engined airliners generally relied on electrical compressors to provide pressurized cabin air. Engine supercharging and cabin pressurization enabled planes like the [[Douglas DC-6]], the [[Douglas DC-7]], and the Constellation to have certified service ceilings from {{convert|24000|ft|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|28400|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Designing a pressurized fuselage to cope with that altitude range was within the engineering and metallurgical knowledge of that time. The introduction of jet airliners required a significant increase in cruise altitudes to the {{convert|30000|-|41000|ft|m|abbr=on}} range, where jet engines are more fuel efficient. That increase in cruise altitudes required far more rigorous engineering of the fuselage, and in the beginning not all the engineering problems were fully understood.

The world’s first commercial jet airliner was the British [[de Havilland Comet]] (1949) designed with a service ceiling of {{convert|36000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. It was the first time that a large diameter, pressurized fuselage with windows had been built and flown at this altitude. Initially, the design was very successful but [[South African Airways Flight 201#Official investigation|two catastrophic airframe failures in 1954]] resulting in the total loss of the aircraft, passengers and crew grounded what was then the entire world jet airliner fleet. Extensive investigation and groundbreaking engineering analysis of the wreckage led to a number of very significant engineering advances that solved the basic problems of pressurized fuselage design at altitude. The critical problem proved to be a combination of an inadequate understanding of the effect of progressive [[metal fatigue]] as the fuselage undergoes repeated stress cycles coupled with a misunderstanding of how aircraft skin stresses are redistributed around openings in the fuselage such as windows and rivet holes.

The critical engineering principles concerning metal fatigue learned from the Comet 1 program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Behaviour of Skin Fatigue Cracks at the Corners of Windows in a Comet Fuselage|author=R.J. Atkinson, W.J. Winkworth and G.M. Norris|journal=Aeronautrical Research Council Reports and Memoranda|year=1962|citeseerx=10.1.1.226.7667}}&lt;/ref&gt; were applied directly to the design of the [[Boeing 707]] (1957) and all subsequent jet airliners. One immediately noticeable legacy of the Comet disasters is the oval windows on every jet airliner; the metal fatigue cracks that destroyed the Comets were initiated by the small radius corners on the Comet 1’s almost square windows. The Comet fuselage was redesigned and the Comet 4 (1958) went on to become a successful airliner, pioneering the first transatlantic jet service, but the program never really recovered from these disasters and was overtaken by the Boeing 707.

The [[Concorde]] had to deal with particularly high pressure differentials because it flew at unusually high altitude (up to {{convert|60000|ft|m}}) and maintained a cabin altitude of {{convert|6000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hepburn|first1=A.N.|title=Human Factors in the Concord|journal=Occupational Medicine|date=1967|volume=17|issue=2|pages=47–51|doi=10.1093/occmed/17.2.47|url=http://occmed.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/17/2/47.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made the aircraft significantly heavier and contributed to the high cost of a flight. The Concorde also had smaller cabin windows than most other commercial passenger aircraft in order to slow the rate of decompression if a window failed.&lt;ref name = 'nunn'&gt;{{cite book |title=Nunn's applied respiratory physiology |first = John Francis |last = Nunn |publisher=Butterworth-Heineman |isbn = 0-7506-1336-X |year = 1993 |page = 341}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high cruising altitude also required the use of high pressure oxygen and [[Diving regulator#Demand valve|demand valves]] at the emergency masks unlike the [[Oxygen mask|continuous-flow masks]] used in conventional airliners.

The designed operating cabin altitude for new aircraft is falling and this is expected to reduce any remaining physiological problems.

[[Image:rice chaffs.jpg|thumb|[[Rice]] chaff]]

'''Chaff''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|æ|f}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|tʃ|ɑː|f}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cambridge Pronouncing Dictionary|author=Daniel Jones|editor1=Peter Roach |editor2=James Hartman |editor3=Jane Setter |publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the dry, scaly protective casings of the seeds of [[cereal grain]], or similar fine, dry, scaly plant material such as scaly parts of [[flower]]s, or finely chopped [[straw]]. Chaff is indigestible by humans, but [[livestock]] can eat it and in [[agriculture]] it is used as livestock [[fodder]], or is a waste material [[plough]]ed into the [[soil]] or burnt.

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|chaff|glume}}
"Chaff" comes from [[Middle English]] ''chaf'', from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''ceaf'', related to [[Old High German]] ''cheva'', "husk".

==Grain chaff==
[[Image:Usdaeinkorn1 Triticum monococcum.jpg|thumbnail|Spikelets of a hulled wheat, [[Einkorn wheat|einkorn]]]]In [[Poaceae|grass]]es (including [[cereal]]s such as [[rice]], [[barley]], [[oat]]s, and [[wheat]]), the ripe seed is surrounded by thin, dry, scaly [[bracts]] (called [[glume]]s, [[Lemma (botany)|lemma]]s and [[palea (botany)|palea]]s), forming a dry [[husk]] (or hull) around the grain. Once it is removed it is often referred to as chaff.
 
In wild  cereals and in the primitive domesticated [[einkorn]],&lt;ref name=Potts&gt;Potts, D. T. (1996) ''Mesopotamia Civilization: The Material Foundations'' [[Cornell University Press]]. p. 62. {{ISBN|0-8014-3339-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[emmer]]&lt;ref&gt;Nevo, Eviatar &amp; A. B. Korol &amp; A. Beiles &amp; T. Fahima. (2002) ''Evolution of Wild Emmer and Wheat Improvement: Population Genetics, Genetic Resources, and Genome...''. Springer. p. 8. {{ISBN|3-540-41750-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[spelt]]&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, J. G. &amp; P. A. Judd. (2003) ''The Oxford Book of Health Foods''. [[Oxford University Press]]. p. 35. {{ISBN|0-19-850459-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; wheats, the husks enclose each seed tightly.  Before the grain can be used, the husks must be removed.

The process of loosening the chaff from the grain so as to remove it is called ''[[threshing]]'' &amp;ndash; traditionally done by milling or pounding. Separating remaining loose chaff from the grain is called ''[[winnowing]]'' &amp;ndash; traditionally done by repeatedly tossing the grain up into a light wind which gradually blows the lighter chaff away. This method typically utilizes a broad, plate-shaped basket or similar receptacle to hold and collect the winnowed grain as it falls back down.

Domesticated grains such as [[durum wheat]] and [[common wheat]] have been bred to have chaff that is easily removed. These varieties are known as ''free-threshing'' or ''naked''.

Chaff should not be confused with [[bran]], which is finer scaly material that is part of the grain itself.

==Straw chaff==
Chaff is also made by chopping [[straw]] (or sometimes coarse [[hay]]) into very short lengths, using a machine called a [[chaff cutter]].  Like grain chaff this is used as animal feed, and is a way of turning coarse fodder into a form more palatable to livestock.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.dulwichpicturegallery.org.uk/collection/search/display.aspx?irn=56 "The Chaff cutter"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiquefarmtools.info/ Cutting chaff by hand]: detail of painting by [[David Teniers the Younger]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorians.asp-host.co.uk/themes/agriculture/chaffcutterobj.htm A Victorian chaff cutter] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321063813/http://www.victorians.asp-host.co.uk/themes/agriculture/chaffcutterobj.htm |date=March 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Botany==
In [[botany]], chaff refers to the thin [[List of plant morphology terms#Basic flower parts|receptacular]] [[bracts]] of many species in the sunflower family [[Asteraceae]] and related families. They are modified scale-like [[leaves]] surrounding single [[floret]]s in the flower-head.&lt;ref name="Jones2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Jones|title=Plant Life of Kentucky: An Illustrated Guide to the Vascular Flora|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bsngx7s0OI4C&amp;pg=PA751|date=25 March 2005|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-7194-6|pages=751–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphor==
Chaff as a waste product from grain processing leads to a [[metaphor]]ical use of the term, to refer to something seen as worthless.  This is commonly used in the expression "to separate the wheat from the chaff" from [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 3:12 which says: Whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.&lt;ref name="Manser2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin H. Manser|title=I Never Knew That Was in the Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3hPJjxbDpxgC&amp;pg=PT1224|date=13 February 2000|publisher=Thomas Nelson Inc|isbn=978-1-4185-6690-6|pages=1224–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compare also the "[[Parable of the Tares]]", which refers to a mixture of wheat and [[Lolium temulentum|tares]] (a kind of weed). Another example is in Psalm 1:4 of the [[Bible]], which says: The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away. (KJV)

==Use==
Hungarian engineer László Schremmer has recently discovered that by the use of chaff-based filters it is possible to reduce the [[arsenic]] content of  water to 3 microgram/litre. This is especially important in areas where the potable water is provided by filtering the water extracted from the underground [[aquifer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mno.hu/gazdasag/szenzacios-magyar-talalmany-1068315 Newspaper article] (in Hungarian) published by [[Magyar Nemzet]] on April 15, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21982">'''Chemical thermodynamics''' is the study of the interrelation of [[heat]] and [[thermodynamic work|work]] with [[chemical reaction]]s or with physical changes of [[thermodynamic state|state]] within the confines of the [[laws of thermodynamics]]. Chemical thermodynamics involves not only laboratory measurements of various thermodynamic properties, but also the application of mathematical methods to the study of chemical questions and the ''spontaneity'' of processes.

The structure of chemical thermodynamics is based on the first two [[laws of thermodynamics]].  Starting from the first and second laws of thermodynamics, four equations called the "fundamental equations of Gibbs" can be derived.  From these four, a multitude of equations, relating the thermodynamic properties of the [[thermodynamic system]] can be derived using relatively simple mathematics.  This outlines the mathematical framework of chemical thermodynamics.&lt;ref name="Book1" &gt;{{cite book | last = Ott | first = Bevan J.  |author2=Boerio-Goates, Juliana | title = Chemical Thermodynamics – Principles and Applications | publisher = Academic Press | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-12-530990-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Willard Gibbs.jpg|right|thumb|[[J. Willard Gibbs]] - founder of ''chemical thermodynamics'']]
In 1865, the German physicist [[Rudolf Clausius]], in his ''Mechanical Theory of Heat'', suggested that the principles of [[thermochemistry]], e.g. the [[heat]] evolved in [[Combustion|combustion reactions]], could be applied to the principles of [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;Clausius, R. (1865). ''The Mechanical Theory of Heat – with its Applications to the Steam Engine and to Physical Properties of Bodies.'' London: John van Voorst, 1 Paternoster Row. MDCCCLXVII.&lt;/ref&gt;  Building on the work of Clausius, between the years 1873-76 the American mathematical physicist [[Willard Gibbs]] published a series of three papers, the most famous one being the paper ''[[On the Equilibrium of Heterogeneous Substances]]''.  In these papers, Gibbs showed how the first two [[laws of thermodynamics]] could be measured graphically and mathematically to determine both the [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] of chemical reactions as well as their tendencies to occur or proceed.  Gibbs’ collection of papers provided the first unified body of thermodynamic theorems from the principles developed by others, such as Clausius and [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]].

During the early 20th century, two major publications successfully applied the principles developed by Gibbs to chemical processes, and thus established the foundation of the science of chemical thermodynamics.  The first was the 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances'' by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and [[Merle Randall]].  This book was responsible for supplanting the [[chemical affinity]] with the term [[thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] in the English-speaking world.  The second was the 1933 book ''Modern Thermodynamics by the methods of Willard Gibbs'' written by [[E. A. Guggenheim]].  In this manner, Lewis, Randall, and Guggenheim are considered as the founders of modern chemical thermodynamics because of the major contribution of these two books in unifying the application of [[thermodynamics]] to [[chemistry]].&lt;ref name="Book1" /&gt;

== Overview ==
The primary objective of chemical thermodynamics is the establishment of a criterion for the determination of the feasibility or [[spontaneous process|spontaneity]] of a given transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Klotz, I. (1950). ''Chemical Thermodynamics.'' New York: Prentice-Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, chemical thermodynamics is typically used to predict the [[energy]] exchanges that occur in the following processes:
#[[Chemical reaction]]s
#[[Phase changes]]
#The formation of [[solutions]]

The following [[state function]]s are of primary concern in chemical thermodynamics:

*[[Internal energy]] (''U'')

Most identities in chemical thermodynamics arise from application of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, particularly the [[Conservation of energy|law of conservation of energy]], to these state functions.

'''The 3 laws of thermodynamics''':
#The energy of the universe is constant.
#In any spontaneous process, there is always an increase in entropy of the universe
#The entropy of a perfect crystal(well ordered) at 0 Kelvin is zero

==Chemical energy==
{{Main|Chemical energy}}
'''Chemical energy''' is the potential of a [[chemical substance]] to undergo a transformation through a [[chemical reaction]] or to transform other chemical substances. Breaking or making of chemical bonds involves [[energy]] or heat, which may be either absorbed or evolved from a chemical system.

Energy that can be released (or absorbed) because of a reaction between a set of chemical substances is equal to the difference between the energy content of the products and the reactants. This change in energy is called the change in [[internal energy]] of a chemical reaction. Where &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\rm f}U^{\rm o}_{\mathrm {reactants}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[internal energy]] of formation of the reactant molecules that can be calculated from the [[bond energy|bond energies]] of the various chemical bonds of the molecules under consideration and &lt;math&gt;\Delta_{\rm f}U^{\rm o}_{\mathrm {products}}&lt;/math&gt; is the internal energy of formation of the product molecules. The change in internal energy is a process which is equal to the heat change if it is measured under conditions of constant volume (at STP condition), as in a closed rigid container such as a [[Calorimeter#Bomb calorimeters|bomb calorimeter]]. However, under conditions of constant pressure, as in reactions in vessels open to the atmosphere, the measured heat change is not always equal to the internal energy change, because pressure-volume work also releases or absorbs energy. (The heat change at constant pressure is called the [[enthalpy]] change; in this case the [[Standard enthalpy change of formation|enthalpy of formation]]).

Another useful term is the [[heat of combustion]], which is the energy released due to a [[combustion]] reaction and often applied in the study of [[fuels]]. Food is similar to hydrocarbon fuel and carbohydrate fuels, and when it is oxidized, its caloric content is similar (though not assessed in the same way as a hydrocarbon fuel — see [[food energy]]).

In chemical thermodynamics the term used for the chemical potential energy is [[chemical potential]], and for chemical transformation an equation most often used is the [[Gibbs-Duhem equation]].

==Chemical reactions==
{{Main|Chemical reaction}}
In most cases of interest in chemical thermodynamics there are internal [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]] and processes, such as [[chemical reaction]]s and [[phase transition]]s, which always create [[entropy]] unless they are at equilibrium, or are maintained at a "running equilibrium" through "quasi-static" changes by being coupled to constraining devices, such as [[piston]]s or [[electrode]]s, to deliver and receive external work. Even for homogeneous "bulk" materials, the free energy functions depend on the [[chemical compound|composition]], as do all the [[extensive quantity|extensive]] [[thermodynamic potentials]], including the internal energy. If the quantities {&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;}, the number of [[chemical species]], are omitted from the formulae, it is impossible to describe compositional changes.

===Gibbs function or Gibbs Energy===
For a "bulk" (unstructured) system they are the last remaining extensive variables. For an unstructured, homogeneous "bulk" system, there are still various ''extensive'' compositional variables {&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;} that ''G'' depends on, which specify the composition, the amounts of each [[chemical substance]], expressed as the numbers of molecules present or (dividing by [[Avogadro's number]] = 6.023 × 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;), the numbers of [[mole (unit)|moles]]

:&lt;math&gt; G = G(T,P,\{N_i\})\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For the case where only ''PV'' work is possible

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}G = -S\, \mathrm{d}T + V \, \mathrm{d}P + \sum_i \mu_i \, \mathrm{d}N_i \,&lt;/math&gt;

in which ''μ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the [[chemical potential]] for the ''i''-th [[component (thermodynamics)|component]] in the system

:&lt;math&gt; \mu_i  = \left( \frac{\partial G}{\partial N_i}\right)_{T,P,N_{j\ne i},etc. } \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The expression for d''G'' is especially useful at constant ''T'' and ''P'', conditions which are easy to achieve experimentally and which approximates the condition in [[life|living]] creatures

:&lt;math&gt; (\mathrm{d}G)_{T,P} = \sum_i \mu_i \, \mathrm{d}N_i\,.&lt;/math&gt;

===Chemical affinity===
{{main|Chemical affinity}}
While this formulation is mathematically defensible, it is not particularly transparent since one does not simply add or remove molecules from a system. There is always a ''process'' involved in changing the composition; e.g., a chemical reaction (or many), or movement of molecules from one phase (liquid) to another (gas or solid). We should find a notation which does not seem to imply that the amounts of the components (&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;) can be changed independently. All real processes obey [[conservation of mass]], and in addition, conservation of the numbers of [[atom]]s of each kind. Whatever molecules are transferred to or from should be considered part of the "system".

Consequently, we introduce an explicit variable to represent the degree of advancement of a process, a progress [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]]&amp;nbsp;''ξ'' for the ''[[extent of reaction]]'' (Prigogine &amp; Defay, p.&amp;nbsp;18; Prigogine, pp.&amp;nbsp;4–7; Guggenheim, p.&amp;nbsp;37.62), and to the use of the [[partial derivative]] ∂''G''/∂''ξ'' (in place of the widely used "Δ''G''", since the quantity at issue is not a finite change). The result is an understandable [[expression (mathematics)|expression]] for the dependence of d''G'' on [[chemical reaction]]s (or other processes). If there is just one reaction
:&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{d}G)_{T,P} = \left( \frac{\partial G}{\partial \xi}\right)_{T,P} \, \mathrm{d}\xi.\,&lt;/math&gt;

If we introduce the ''[[stoichiometric coefficient]]'' for the ''i-th'' component in the reaction

::&lt;math&gt;\nu_i = \partial N_i / \partial \xi \,&lt;/math&gt;

which tells how many molecules of ''i'' are produced or consumed, we obtain an algebraic expression for the partial derivative

:&lt;math&gt; \left( \frac{\partial G}{\partial \xi} \right)_{T,P} = \sum_i \mu_i \nu_i = -\mathbb{A}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where, (De Donder; Progoine &amp; Defay, p.&amp;nbsp;69; Guggenheim, pp.&amp;nbsp;37,240), we introduce a concise and historical name for this quantity, the "[[chemical affinity|affinity]]", symbolized by '''A''', as introduced by [[Théophile de Donder]] in 1923. The minus sign comes from the fact the affinity was defined to represent the rule that spontaneous changes will ensue only when the change in the Gibbs free energy of the process is negative, meaning that the chemical species have a positive affinity for each other. The differential for ''G'' takes on a simple form which displays its dependence on compositional change

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{d}G)_{T,P} = -\mathbb{A}\, d\xi  \,.&lt;/math&gt;

If there are a number of chemical reactions going on simultaneously, as is usually the case

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{d}G)_{T,P} = -\sum_k\mathbb{A}_k\, d\xi_k  \,.&lt;/math&gt;

a set of reaction coordinates {&amp;nbsp;ξ&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;}, avoiding the notion that the amounts of the components (&amp;nbsp;''N''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;) can be changed independently. The expressions above are equal to zero at [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], while in the general case for real systems, they are negative because all chemical reactions proceeding at a finite rate produce entropy. This can be made even more explicit by introducing the reaction ''rates'' d''ξ''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;/d''t''. For each and every &lt;span style="color:maroon;"&gt;''physically independent''&lt;/span&gt; ''process'' (Prigogine &amp; Defay, p.&amp;nbsp;38; Prigogine, p.&amp;nbsp;24)

::&lt;math&gt; \mathbb{A}\ \dot{\xi} \le 0  \,.&lt;/math&gt;

This is a remarkable result since the chemical potentials are intensive system variables, depending only on the local molecular milieu. They cannot "know" whether the temperature and pressure (or any other system variables) are going to be held constant over time. It is a purely local criterion and must hold regardless of any such constraints. Of course, it could have been obtained by taking partial derivatives of any of the other fundamental state functions, but nonetheless is a general criterion for (&amp;minus;''T'' times) the entropy production from that spontaneous process; or at least any part of it that is not captured as external work. (See ''Constraints'' below.)

We now relax the requirement of a homogeneous “bulk” system by letting the [[chemical potential]]s and the affinity apply to any locality in which a chemical reaction (or any other process) is occurring. By accounting for the [[entropy production]] due to irreversible processes, the inequality for d''G'' is now replaced by an equality

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}G = - S \, \mathrm{d}T + V \, \mathrm{d}P -\sum_k\mathbb{A}_k\, \mathrm{d}\xi_k  + W'\,&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{d}G_{T,P} = -\sum_k\mathbb{A}_k\, \mathrm{d}\xi_k  + W'.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Any decrease in the [[Gibbs function]] of a system is the upper limit for any [[isothermal process|isothermal]], [[isobaric process|isobaric]] work that can be captured in the [[surroundings]], or it may simply be [[dissipation|dissipated]], appearing as ''T'' times a corresponding increase in the entropy of the system and/or its surrounding. Or it may go partly toward doing external work and partly toward creating entropy. The important point is that the ''[[extent of reaction]]'' for a chemical reaction may be coupled to the displacement of some external mechanical or electrical quantity in such a way that one can advance only if the other one also does. The coupling may occasionally be ''rigid'', but it is often flexible and variable.

===Solutions===
In solution [[chemistry]] and [[biochemistry]], the [[Gibbs free energy]] decrease (∂''G''/∂''ξ'', in molar units, denoted cryptically by Δ''G'') is commonly used as a surrogate for (&amp;minus;''T'' times) the entropy produced by spontaneous [[chemical reaction]]s in situations where there is no work being done; or at least no "useful" work; i.e., other than perhaps some ±&amp;nbsp;''P'' d''V''. The assertion that all ''spontaneous reactions have a negative Δ''G'' is merely a restatement of the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]], giving it the [[dimensional analysis|physical dimensions]] of energy and somewhat obscuring its significance in terms of entropy. When there is no useful work being done, it would be less misleading to use the [[Legendre transformation|Legendre transform]]s of the entropy appropriate for constant ''T'', or for constant ''T'' and ''P'', the Massieu functions  &amp;minus;''F''/''T'' and &amp;minus;''G''/''T'' respectively.

==Non equilibrium==
{{Main|non-equilibrium thermodynamics}}

Generally the systems treated with the conventional chemical thermodynamics are either at equilibrium or near equilibrium. [[Ilya Prigogine]] developed the thermodynamic treatment of [[Open system (systems theory)|open systems]] that are far from equilibrium. In doing so he has discovered phenomena and structures of completely new and completely unexpected types. His generalized, nonlinear and irreversible thermodynamics has found surprising applications in a wide variety of fields.

The non equilibrium thermodynamics has been applied for explaining how ordered structures e.g. the biological systems, can develop from disorder. Even if Onsager's relations are utilized, the classical principles of equilibrium in thermodynamics still show that linear systems close to equilibrium always develop into states of disorder which are stable to perturbations and cannot explain the occurrence of ordered structures.

Prigogine called these systems [[dissipative systems]], because they are formed and maintained by the dissipative processes which take place because of the exchange of energy between the system and its environment and because they disappear if that exchange ceases. They may be said to live in [[symbiosis]] with their environment.

The method which Prigogine used to study the stability of the dissipative structures to perturbations is of very great general interest. It makes it possible to study the most varied problems, such as city traffic problems, the stability of insect communities, the development of ordered biological structures and the growth of cancer cells to mention but a few examples.

===System constraints===

In this regard, it is crucial to understand the role of walls and other ''constraints'', and the distinction between ''independent'' processes and ''coupling''. Contrary to the clear implications of many reference sources, the previous analysis is not restricted to [[wiktionary:homogeneous|homogeneous]], [[isotropy|isotropic]] bulk systems which can deliver only ''P''d''V'' work to the outside world, but applies even to the most structured systems. There are complex systems with many chemical "reactions" going on at the same time, some of which are really only parts of the same, overall process. An ''independent'' process is one that ''could'' proceed even if all others were unaccountably stopped in their tracks. Understanding this is perhaps a “[[thought experiment]]” in [[chemical kinetics]], but actual examples exist.

A gas reaction which results in an increase in the number of molecules will lead to an increase in volume at constant external pressure. If it occurs inside a cylinder closed with a piston, the equilibrated reaction can proceed only by doing work against an external force on the piston. The extent variable for the reaction can increase only if the piston moves, and conversely, if the piston is pushed inward, the reaction is driven backwards.

Similarly, a [[redox]] reaction might occur in an [[electrochemistry|electrochemical]] cell with the passage of [[electric current|current]] in [[wire]]s connecting the [[electrode]]s. The half-cell reactions at the [[electrode]]s are constrained if no current is allowed to flow. The current might be dissipated as [[joule heating]], or it might in turn run an electrical device like a [[electric motor|motor]] doing [[mechanical work]]. An [[automobile]] [[lead]]-[[acid]] [[battery (electricity)|battery]] can be recharged, driving the chemical reaction backwards. In this case as well, the reaction is not an independent process. Some, perhaps most, of the Gibbs free energy of reaction may be delivered as external work.

The [[hydrolysis]] of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] to [[adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] and [[phosphate]] can drive the [[force]] times [[distance]] work delivered by living [[muscle]]s, and synthesis of ATP is in turn driven by a redox chain in [[Mitochonndrion|mitochondria]] and [[chloroplast]]s, which involves the transport of [[ion]]s across the membranes of these [[cell (biology)|cell]]ular [[organelle]]s. The coupling of processes here, and in the previous examples, is often not complete. Gas can leak slowly past a piston, just as it can slowly leak out of a [[rubber]] [[balloon]]. Some reaction may occur in a battery even if no external current is flowing. There is usually a coupling [[coefficient]], which may depend on relative rates, which determines what percentage of the driving free energy is turned into external work, or captured as "chemical work"; a misnomer for the free energy of another chemical process.

Green]] and [[Marian Petre]].  The dimensions can be used to evaluate the [[usability]] of an existing ''information artifact'', or as heuristics to guide the design of a new one.

Cognitive dimensions are designed to provide a lightweight approach to analyse the quality of a design, rather than an in-depth, detailed description.  They provide a common vocabulary for discussing many factors in notation, UI or programming language design.  Also, cognitive dimensions help in exploring the space of possible designs through ''design maneuvers'', changes intended to improve the design along one dimension.

==List of the cognitive dimensions==
Thomas Green originally defined 14 cognitive dimensions:

; Abstraction gradient : What are the minimum and maximum [[Abstraction (computer science)#Levels of abstraction|levels of abstraction]] exposed by the notation? Can details be [[Encapsulation (computer science)|encapsulated]]?

; Closeness of mapping : How closely does the notation correspond to the [[Problem domain|problem]] world?

; Consistency : After part of the notation has been [[Learnability|learned]], how much of the rest can be successfully guessed?

; Diffuseness / terseness : How many [[Symbol (formal)|symbol]]s or how much space does the notation require to produce a certain result or express a [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]?

; Error-proneness : To what extent does the notation influence the likelihood of [[user error|the user making a mistake]]?

; Hard mental operations : How much [[mental effort|hard mental processing]] lies at the notational level, rather than at the [[semantic]] level? Are there places where the user needs to resort to fingers or penciled annotation to keep track of what’s happening?

; Hidden dependencies : Are [[Coupling (computer programming)|dependencies]] between entities in the notation visible or hidden? Is every dependency indicated in both directions? Does a change in one area of the notation lead to unexpected consequences?

; Juxtaposability : Can different parts of the notation be compared side-by-side at the same time?

; Premature commitment : Are there strong constraints on the order in which the user must complete the tasks to use the system?

:Are there decisions that must be made before all the necessary information is available? Can those decisions be reversed or corrected later?

; Progressive evaluation : How easy is it to evaluate and obtain [[feedback]] on an incomplete solution?

; Role-expressiveness : How obvious is the [[Role (computer science)|role]] of each component of the notation in the solution as a whole?

; Secondary notation and escape from formalism : Can the notation carry extra information [[Secondary notation|by means not related to syntax]], such as layout, color, or other cues?

; Viscosity
: Are there in the notation any inherent barriers to change? How much effort is required to make a change to a program expressed in the notation?
: This dimension can be further classified into the following types:&lt;ref&gt;[http://acm.org/sigchi/chi96/proceedings/shortpap/Wilde/wn_txt.html Using Cognitive Dimensions in the Classroom as a Discussion Tool for Visual Language Design]&lt;/ref&gt;
:* 'Knock-on viscosity' : a change in the code violates internal constraints in the program, whose resolution may violate further internal constraints.
:* 'Repetition viscosity' : a single action within the user’s conceptual model requires many, repetitive device actions.
:* 'Scope viscosity' : a change in the size of the input data set requires changes to the program structure itself.

; Visibility : How readily can required parts of the notation be identified, accessed and made visible?

===Other dimensions===
In addition to the above, new dimensions are sometimes proposed in the HCI research field,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dealing with New Cognitive Dimensions | citeseerx=10.1.1.18.7947 | first1 = Alan F. | last1 = Blackwell | author-link = Alan F. Blackwell }}&lt;/ref&gt; with different levels of adoption and refinement.

Some of these candidate dimensions include creative ambiguity (does the notation encourage interpreting several meanings of the same element?), indexing (are there elements to guide finding a specific part?), synopsis ("[[Gestalt psychology#Properties|gestalt view]]" of the whole annotated structure) or unevenness (some creation paths are easier than others, which bias the expressed ideas in a developed artifact).

== User activities ==
The authors identify four main user activities with interactive artifacts: ''incrementation'' [creation], ''transcription'', ''modification'' and ''exploratory design''. Each activity is best served by a different trade-off in the usability on each dimension. For example, a high viscosity (resistance to change) is harmful for modification and exploration activities, but less severe for the one-off tasks performed in transcription and incrementation.

== Design maneuvers ==
A '''design maneuver''' is a change made by the designer in the notation design, to alter its position within a particular dimension. Dimensions are created to be pairwise independent, so that the design can be altered in one dimension while keeping a second one constant.

But this usually results in a trade-off between dimensions. A modification increasing the usability of the notation in one dimension (while keeping a second one constant) will typically reduce its usability in a third dimension. This reflects an assumption in the framework that there is no perfect interface and that trade-offs are a fundamental part of usability design.

An example of a design maneuver is reducing the viscosity of a notation by adding abstraction mechanisms. This can be done by incorporating [[Style sheet (desktop publishing)|style sheets]], an abstraction that represent the common styling attributes of items in a document, to a notation where each item in a document has defined its own individual style. After this design maneuver is made, an editor that changes the style sheet will modify all items at once, eliminating the ''repetition viscosity'' present in the need to change the style of each individual item.

{{Critical pedagogy}}
'''Curriculum studies''' ('''CS''') is a concentration within curriculum and instruction concerned with understanding [[curriculum|curricula]] as an active force of human educational experience.

==Overview==
Specific questions related to curriculum studies include the following: 
*What should be taught in [[school]]s? 
*Why should it be taught? To whom should it be taught? 
*What does it mean to be an educated person?

Components of CS also investigate the relationship between [[curriculum theory]] and educational practice and the relationship between school programs and the contours of the [[society]] and [[culture]] in which schools are located. There are [[#University programs|programs in the field of curriculum studies]] in several Colleges of Education around the world. Curriculum studies was also the first subdivision of the [[American Educational Research Association]], known as Division B.

Important CS books include ''The Curriculum: Perspective, Paradigm, and Possibility'' by William Schubert (New York: Macmillan, 1986; and ''Understanding Curriculum'' by [[William Pinar]], et al. (New York: Peter Lang Publishing, 1995).

Curriculum studies emerged as a distinctive field in the late 1960s and early 1970s from educationists focused on curriculum development. The shift from developing and evaluating curriculum to understanding curriculum is known as the "Reconceptualization" of the curriculum field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pacheco|first1=Jose, Augusto|title=Curriculum studies: What is the field today?|journal=Journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Curriculum Studies|date=2012|volume=8|pages=18|url=https://www.uwstout.edu/soe/jaaacs/upload/v8_What_Is_The_Field_Today.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A branch of curriculum studies that investigates how society transmits culture from generation to generation has been tagged with the term "[[hidden curriculum]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Mark, K|title=Curriculum theory and practice|url=http://infed.org/mobi/curriculum-theory-and-practice/|website=infed.org|publisher=The Encyclopaedia of Informal Education|accessdate=18 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; even though much of what is studied is hiding in plain sight.  For instance, one of the 19th century founders of the discipline of [[sociology]], [[Émile Durkheim]], observed that more is taught and learned in schools than specified in the established curriculum of textbooks and teacher manuals.  In ''Moral Education'' Durkheim wrote:

:"In fact, there is a whole system of rules in the school that predetermine the child's conduct.  He must come to class regularly, he must arrive at a specified time and with an appropriate bearing and attitude.  He must not disrupt things in class.  He must have learned his lessons, done his homework, and have done so reasonably well, etc.  There are, therefore, a host of obligations that the child is required to shoulder.  Together they constitute the discipline of the school.  It is through the practice of school discipline that we can inculcate the spirit of discipline in the child. (Durkheim, Émile (1961 [1925]). ''Moral Education''. New York, The Free Press.p.&amp;nbsp;148)"

[[Phillip W. Jackson]] (1968) may have coined the term "hidden curriculum" in his book ''Life in Classrooms''.  He argued that [[primary school]] emphasized specific skills: learning to wait quietly, exercising restraint, trying, completing work, keeping busy, cooperating, showing allegiance to both teachers and peers, being neat and punctual, and so on (Jackson, Philip (1968). ''Life in Classrooms''.). The [[Structural functionalism|structural functional]] sociologist [[Robert Dreeben]] (1968 ''On What is Learned in School'') similarly concluded that the curriculum of schooling taught students to "form transient social relationships, submerge much of their personal identity, and accept the legitimacy of categorical treatment".  Dreeben argued that formal schooling indirectly conveyed to students values such as independence and achievement, essential for their later membership in society. 
 
Since then, curriculum studies researchers ranging across the spectrum of paradigms&amp;mdash;from conservative structural-[[Structural functionalism|functionalists]], to neo-[[Marxist]]s to narrative- and arts-based researchers&amp;mdash;have examined formal curricula, experienced curricula, and hidden curricula.  Progressive researchers like Paul Willis (1977, ''Learning to Labor: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs''), Jean Anyon  (1980, "Social Class and the Hidden Curriculum of Work". ''Journal of Education'' 162), and [[Annette Lareau]] (1989. ''Home Advantage: Social Class, and Parental Intervention in Elementary Education'') have examined the ways that hidden and overt curricula reproduce [[social class]] position.  Narrative and arts-based researchers like Thomas Barone (2001, ''Touching Eternity: The Enduring Outcomes of Teaching'') have inquired about the long-term effects of curricula on student lives.

Critical theorists like [[Henry Giroux]] (1983 "Theories of Reproduction and Resistance in the New Sociology of Education: A critical analysis." ''Harvard Educational Review'' 53) began to examine the roles of students and teachers in resisting curricula both official and hidden.  So-called "resistance theorists" conceptualized students and teachers as active agents working to subvert, reject, or change curricula.  They noted that "curriculum" was not a unified structure but incoherent conflicting and contradictory messages. Other researchers have examined the interactions between racial and [[ethnic]] cultures and the dominant curricula of the school. For instance the anthropologist John Ogbu examined curricula established by [[African American]] students ([[Signithia Fordham]] and John Ogbu 1986 "Black Students' School Success: Coping with the Burden of 'Acting White.' ''The Urban Review'' 18).   [[Critical race theory|Critical race theorists]] like Daniel Solórzano examined how racial attitudes constitute another "hidden" curriculum in teacher education programs (1997, Images and Words that Wound: Critical Race Theory and Racial Stereotyping, and Teacher Education, ''Teacher Education Quarterly'', 24). Additionally, Judith Stacey proposed in the 1960s schools conveyed a hidden curriculum that perpetuated the "sexist beliefs, attitudes, and values" of the time period (1974 "And Jill Came Tumbling After Sexism in American Education").&lt;ref&gt;Stacey, Judith, et al. (eds.) (1974). And Jill Came Tumbling After: Sexism in American Education. New York: Dell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The interest in curriculum studies is thus cross disciplinary and of increasing importance to [[educational research]] and to the [[philosophy of education]].

A '''drabble''' is a short work of fiction of one hundred words in length.&lt;ref name="WRR"&gt;[http://www.therecord.com/print/article/602546 "Winners named in WLU drabble competition"], ''[[Waterloo Region Record]]'', October 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Flash fiction: 'Intense, urgent and a little explosive'", ''[[The Irish Times]]'', October 26, 2011, copy available [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-29941178.html here] from [[HighBeam Research]] (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Womer, [https://archive.is/20130210041029/http://www.yumasun.com/news/story-75397-place-staff.html "AWC professor impressed by short story entries"], ''[[Yuma Sun]]'', December 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SFE&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Flash Fiction |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/flash_fiction |encyclopedia=[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]] |date=21 December 2011|accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the drabble is brevity, testing the author's ability to express interesting and meaningful ideas in a confined space.

==History==
The concept is said to have originated in [[United Kingdom|UK]] science fiction fandom in the 1980s; the 100-word format was established by the [[Birmingham University]] SF Society, taking a term from [[Monty Python]]'s 1971 ''[[Monty Python's Big Red Book|Big Red Book]]''.&lt;ref name="WRR"/&gt;&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; In the book, "Drabble" was described as a word game where the first participant to write a [[novel]] was the winner. In order to make the game possible in the real world, it was agreed that 100 words would suffice. 
 
In drabble contests, participants are given a [[Theme (literary)|theme]] and a certain amount of time to write.  (For example, [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] conducted a "100 Words Centennial Drabble Contest" in commemoration of its 100th anniversary in 2011, in which contestants were asked to write about "inspiration, leadership or purpose".&lt;ref name="WRR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liz Smith, [http://thecord.ca/articles/47813 "Laurier launches literary competition to commemorate Centennial year"]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[The Cord Weekly]]'', September 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;) Drabble contests, and drabbles in general, are popular in [[science fiction fandom]] and in [[fan fiction]].  Beccon Publications published three volumes, ''The Drabble Project'' (1988) and ''Drabble II: Double Century'' (1990), both edited by Rob Meades and David Wake, and ''Drabble Who'' (1993), edited by [[David J. Howe]] and David Wake.

==Examples==
Published science fiction writers who have written drabbles include [[Brian Aldiss]] and [[Gene Wolfe]] (both of whom contributed to ''The Drabble Project''),&lt;ref name=SFE/&gt; [[Lois McMaster Bujold]] (whose novel ''[[Cryoburn]]'' finishes with a sequence of five drabbles, each told from the point of view of a different character),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2011/09/review_cryoburn_a_miles_vorkosigan_novel_by_lois_mcmaster_bujold/ |title=REVIEW: ‘Cryoburn (A Miles Vorkosigan Novel)’ by Lois McMaster Bujold |author=T K Kenyon |date=22 September  2011 |publisher=SF Signal |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Science fiction books |author=Fred Cleaver |url=http://www.denverpost.com/rss/ci_16651750 |newspaper=[[Denver Post]] |date=21 November 2010 |accessdate=2 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jake Bible]] (whose novel ''Dead Mech'' was written entirely in drabble format).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://jakebible.com/whats-a-drabble/|title=What’s A Drabble?|date=2010-01-10|work=Jake Bible Fiction|access-date=2017-05-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''100 Word Story'' is an online literary journal that was co-founded in 2011 by [[Grant Faulkner]] and Lynn Mundell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thereviewreview.net/interviews/flash-fiction|title=Flash! Fiction!  - The Review Review|website=www.thereviewreview.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; It publishes stories that are exactly 100 words long.

The web has also enabled a rapid spread of the genre, with publishers such as [[The Third Word Press]] using the web to collect drabble stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.third-word.com/|title=The Third Word Press |access-date=2017-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==55 Fiction==
One example of drabble is 55 Fiction, which is a form of [[microfiction]] that refers to the works of fiction that are either limited to a maximum of 55 words or have a requirement of exactly 55 words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ron Wiggins|title=PAPER CHALLENGES WRITERS TO MAKE A LONG STORY SHORT|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PBPB&amp;p_theme=pbpb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EF3F22AEE950D98&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=Palm Beach Post|date=October 11, 2001}} {{Paywall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of ''55 Fiction'' can be traced to a short story writing contest organized by ''New Times'', an independent alternative weekly in [[San Luis Obispo, California]], in 1987.&lt;ref name=fff&gt;{{cite news|title=Mini- és maxiregények|url=http://www.nyest.hu/hirek/mini-es-maxiregenyek|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=Nyelv és Tudomány|date=June 27, 2011|language=hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was proposed by ''New Times'' founder and publisher [[Steve Moss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NEW TIMES PUBLISHER DIED OF EPILEPSY|newspaper=The Tribune|date=May 17, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criteria===
A literary work will be considered ''55 Fiction''{{cn|date=November 2015}} if it has:
# 55 words or fewer, however some publishers actually require exactly 55 words – no more and no less;
# A setting;
# One or more characters;
# Some conflict; and
# A resolution. (''Not limited to the moral of the story'')
The title of the story is not part of the overall word count, but cannot exceed seven words.

'''Ectomesenchyme''' has properties similar to [[mesenchyme]]. The origin of the ectomesenchyme is disputed. It is either like the mesenchyme, arising from [[mesoderm|mesodermic cells]], or conversely arising from [[neural crest cells]]&lt;ref name="pmid14699583"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weston JA, Yoshida H, Robinson V, Nishikawa S, Fraser ST, Nishikawa S |title=Neural crest and the origin of ectomesenchyme: neural fold heterogeneity suggests an alternative hypothesis |journal=Dev.

Ectomesenchyme plays a critical role in the formation of the hard and soft tissues of the head and neck such as bones, muscles, teeth, and, notably, the [[branchial arches]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7384">{{short description|The part of the genome of a population that was advantageous in past circumstances but is currently disadvantageous}}
'''Evolutionary baggage''' is the part of the [[genome]] of a population that was advantageous in past individuals but is disadvantageous under the pressures exerted by [[natural selection]] today.&lt;ref&gt;Appenzeller, T. 1999. "Test tube evolution catches time in a bottle." ''Science.'' 284: 2108-2110&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
[[Gene]]s that may have been advantageous in the past may be critically unfit for individuals in today’s environment. Natural selection is not a perfect process; if an organism is “fit enough” to survive a particular environment and reproduce, its genes are passed on to the next generation.&lt;ref name=Thanukos&gt;Thanukos, A. 2008. "Views from understanding evolution: [[parasite]]s and [[pathogen]]s take the leap." ''Evolution:Education and Outreach'' 1:25-28&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these genes may increase an organism’s fitness while some may even be slightly disadvantageous. This seeming paradox is the origin of evolutionary baggage, which is the collectively inherited traits that evolved in a different environment from the present.&lt;ref name="Thanukos"/&gt;  In the case of humans, the result is a “[[Paleolithic]]” genome, which is not adapted to today’s environment and is contributing to “diseases of civilization,” including [[atherosclerosis]] and [[obesity]].&lt;ref&gt;Spotorno, A.E. 2005. "Evolutionary medicine: an emergent basic science." ''Rev. Med. Chile.'' 133:231-240.&lt;/ref&gt; Other hypotheses link evolutionary baggage to genetic diseases. Since all organisms descended from a [[Common descent|common ancestor]], evolutionary baggage can be seen universally among organisms.&lt;ref name="Thanukos"/&gt;

==Diet==
It is a fundamental biological concept that organisms are most fit if they eat the same diet which their evolution has adapted them to. Throughout history, humans adapted to a diet by living off the land. Today, humans maintain the same genes that have been evolved from our ancestors and adapted to the diet they consumed. This has created a mismatch between the modern diet and lifestyle (which has emerged in evolutionary terms very recently), and the diet and lifestyle to which the human body has slowly adapted to over thousands of years.&lt;ref name=OKeefe&gt;O'Keefe, J.H. and L. Cordain. 2004. "Cardiovascular disease resulting from a diet and lifestyle at odds with our paleolithic genome: how to become a 21st-century hunter-gatherer." ''Mayo. Clin. Proc.'' 79: 101-108.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon can be considered evolutionary baggage because the deviation from the [[Paleolithic#Diet and nutrition|Paleolithic diet]] and lifestyle has led to “diseases of civilization” such as obesity, [[hypertension]], and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type II diabetes]].&lt;ref name="OKeefe"/&gt;

The human body adapted over time to crave [[calorie]]-dense foods and to store energy efficiently because our ancestors did not have abundant food; this is called the [[thrifty gene hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="OKeefe"/&gt; These adaptations are genetic baggage today, causing humans to store fat efficiently despite abundant food availability. This leads to obesity, which is an important [[risk factor]] for [[cardiovascular disease]].&lt;ref name="OKeefe"/&gt; However, studies have shown that consuming a [[Paleolithic diet|Paleolithic-type diet]] rich in unprocessed foods and lean protein decreased [[blood pressure]] and [[cholesterol]] level while increasing [[glucose]] tolerance.&lt;ref name="pmid19209185"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/ejcn.2009.4 |title=Metabolic and physiologic improvements from consuming a paleolithic, hunter-gatherer type diet |year=2009 |last1=Frassetto |first1=L A |last2=Schloetter |first2=M |last3=Mietus-Synder |first3=M |last4=Morris |first4=R C |last5=Sebastian |first5=A |journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=63 |issue=8 |pages=947–955 |pmid=19209185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sickle-cell and malaria==
As a recessive gene, Sickle-cell disease is only present if homozygous, with no dominant gene to beat them out. Sickle-cell disease, originating in people living in tropical areas where malaria is prevalent, is a [[hereditary]] blood disorder characterized by rigid, sickle-shaped red blood cells.. The unusual shape and rigidity of these altered red blood cells reduces a cell’s ability to effectively travel with regular blood flow, occasionally blocking veins and preventing proper blood flow. Life expectancy is shortened for people with sickle-cell disease, though modern medicine has significantly lengthened the life expectancy of someone with this disease. As detrimental as the effects of sickle-cell disease seem, it also offers an unforeseen benefit; humans with the sickle-cell gene show less severe symptoms when infected with malaria, as the abnormal shape of blood cells caused by the disease hinder the malaria parasite’s ability to invade and replicate within these cells.&lt;ref name=Wellems&gt;Wellems TE, Hayton K, Fairhurst RM (September 2009). "The impact of malaria parasitism: from corpuscles to communities". J. Clin. Invest.119 (9): 2496–505.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to have the sickle-cell allele, but not have the disease, for example if heterozygous.
	
[[Malaria]], a [[mosquito]]-borne infectious disease of humans and other animals, is a potentially deadly disease that causes fever, fatigue, nausea, muscular pain, coughing, and, in extreme cases, coma and death. Malaria is caused by parasitic [[protozoans]] transferred through mosquito saliva into a person’s circulatory system, where they travel to the liver to mature. Though eliminated in the U.S., there were an estimated 219 million documented cases of malaria in 2010 according to the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name=Nayyar&gt;Nayyar GML, Breman JG, Newton PN, Herrington J (2012). "Poor-quality antimalarial drugs in southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa".Lancet Infectious Diseases 12 (6): 488–96.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The correlation between [[sickle-cell disease]] and [[malaria]] is a double-edged sword. Having a sickle-cell allele does limit the life expectancy of a person, however, the presence of sickle-cell genes reduces the detrimental effects of malaria should it be contracted. Natural selection allowed for the spreading of the sickle-cell gene in areas of high numbers of mosquitoes carrying malaria; those that weren't as susceptible to malaria were much more likely to live than those that were. Because malaria is not as prevalent as it once was, the benefits of sickle-cell have since eroded, leaving behind the detrimental effects of the disease.

==Implications==
Evolutionary baggage from our ancestors may be causing disease in individuals today. In our ancestors, these phenotypes conferred selective advantage against harsh climate, [[infectious disease]] and scarce food. However, since these conditions are less common in today’s world, individuals with these [[phenotype]]s are at a selective disadvantage. This disadvantage has major implications in the area of [[health care]] because some of the diseases caused by evolutionary baggage are major contributors to the rising cost of health care in developed countries.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

'''Faye Duchin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dj|uː|tʃ|ᵻ|n}}; born 1944) is an American [[Computer Scientist]] and Professor of [[Economics]] at [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] ("RPI"), where she was the Dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences from 1996 to 2002.&lt;ref name="Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economics.rpi.edu/pl/people/faye-duchin|title=Faye Duchin, Professor of Economics|publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|accessdate=2016-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is active in the fields of [[ecological economics]] and [[industrial ecology]] and employs [[Input-output model|Input-Output Analysis]] in her work. Her faculty page at RPI states that she is "concerned with ways of achieving economic development while avoiding environmental disasters."

==Biography==
Faye Duchin was raised in a "very conventional setting" in [[Bayonne, New Jersey|Bayonne]], [[New Jersey]]. She attended [[Cornell University]], earning a BA in Experimental Psychology in 1965 &lt;ref name="Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"/&gt;&lt;ref name="poly"/&gt;&lt;ref name="people"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economics.rpi.edu/index.php?siteid=18&amp;pageid=199&amp;personID=91|title=People – Department of Economics|publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1973 completed her Ph.D. in Computer Science at [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] with a dissertation on the newly passed [[Rent Control]] law in Berkeley.&lt;ref name="poly"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poly.rpi.edu/article_view.php3?view=1041&amp;part=1|title=Dean Duchin has varied background|last=Lutzky|first=Raymond|date=2001-11-14|publisher=The Polytechnic|accessdate=2009-01-06|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060911223642/http://www.poly.rpi.edu/article_view.php3?view=1041&amp;part=1|archivedate=2006-09-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="people"/&gt;

From 1977–1996, Duchin was on the faculty at [[New York University]], where she worked for Nobel Laureate [[Wassily Leontief]] on [[input-output economics]].&lt;ref name="poly"/&gt; In 1985, she became Director of the NYU Institute for Economic Analysis, a position she held until 1996&lt;ref name="cv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/~duchin/cv.html|title=CV|publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; when she left to become Dean of the School of Humanities and Social Sciences at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. In 2002, Duchin resigned as Dean.

==Professional affiliations==
Duchin served as president of the [[International Input-Output Association]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iioa.org/Who%20we%20are-offices.htm|title=Who we are|publisher=International Input-Output Association|accessdate=2008-11-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120904045151/http://www.iioa.org/Who%20we%20are-offices.htm|archivedate=2012-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2004 to 2006,&lt;ref name="activities"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpi.edu/~duchin/activities.html|title=Activities|last=Duchin|first=Faye|publisher=Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|accessdate=2009-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a former Vice President of the [[International Society for Ecological Economics]] (ISEE). She is a member of the editorial boards of various journals, including the journal of [[Industrial Ecology]], having held this position since the journal's founding in 1997.&lt;ref name="activities"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1530-9290/homepage/EditorialBoard.html&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the founders and a managing editor of the journal Structural Change and Economic Dynamics, She is author or co-author of thirty-three works published between 1973 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.scientificcommons.org/faye_duchin|title=Scientific Commons: Faye Duchin|publisher=ScientificCommons.org|accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly contributions==
Duchin has stated that she examines factors that could "make a difference in satisfying major global imperatives."&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; She has examined [[technological change]], [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle change]], [[quality of life]], [[income distribution]], [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]], [[international trade]], [[natural resource]] use and [[environmental degradation]] using [[input-output model]]s. She calls her work "problem-oriented rather than discipline- or technique-oriented" and has used an interdisciplinary approach to study [[sustainability]]. She claims to study physical realities and constraints, not just monetary values, by using process and engineering data to model technology and resource use.

Duchin's RPI web page describes her research agenda:
:"Based on the results of my empirical studies, I became convinced of the need for changes not only in technologies but also in household lifestyles, in particular household decisions regarding diet, housing and transportation. The plausibility and implications of such scenarios need to be explored in a global framework, and I have developed a new model of the world economy for this purpose."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economics.rpi.edu/pl/people/faye-duchin Duchin faculty web page at RPI]&lt;/ref&gt;

Duchin's recent work focuses on [[industrial ecology]], continuing work she began in the early 1990s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2224">A '''functional spinal unit''' (FSU) (or '''motion segment''') is the smallest physiological motion unit of the [[Spinal cord|spine]] to exhibit [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] characteristics similar to those of the entire spine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=White |first1=Augustus A. |last2=Panjabi |first2=Manohar M. |year=1990 |title=Clinical Biomechanics of the Spine |location=Philadelphia |publisher=[[J. B. Lippincott &amp; Co.|Lippincott]] |isbn=0397507208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A FSU consists of two adjacent [[vertebrae]], the [[intervertebral disc]] and all adjoining ligaments between them and excludes other connecting tissues such as muscles. The three-joint complex that results is sometimes referred to as the "articular triad."

[[In vitro]] studies of isolated or multiple FSU's are often used to measure [[biomechanics|biomechanical]] properties of the spine. The typical load-displacement behavior of a cadaveric FSU specimen is nonlinear. Within the total range of passive motion of any FSU, the typical load-displacement curve consists of 2 regions or 'zones' that exhibit very different biomechanical behavior. In the vicinity of the resting neutral position of the FSU, this load-displacement behavior is highly flexible. This is the region known as the 'neutral zone', which is the motion region of the joint where the passive osteoligamentous [[joint stability|stability]] mechanisms exert little or no influence. During passive physiological movement of the FSU, motion occurs in this region against minimal internal resistance. It is a region in which a small load causes a relatively large displacement.The 'elastic zone' is the remaining region of FSU motion that continues from the end of the neutral zone to the point of maximum resistance (provided by the passive osteoligamentous stability mechanism), thus limiting the range of motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Panjabi |first=M. M. |title=The stabilizing system of the spine. Part II. Neutral zone and instability hypothesis |journal=J Spinal Disord |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=390–7 |year=1992 |doi=10.1097/00002517-199212000-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8401">'''George Vicesimus Wigram''' (28 March 1805 – 1 February 1879) was an English biblical scholar and theologian.

==Early life==
He was the 20th child (hence his middle name) of [[Sir Robert Wigram, 1st Baronet]], a famous and wealthy merchant, and the 14th child of Lady Eleanor Wigram, Robert's 2nd wife (an aunt to [[Charles Stewart Parnell]]). His family were all capable and several of his siblings became illustrious in their own field. [[James Wigram (judge)|Sir James Wigram]] became a judge and Vice-Chancellor; [[Joseph Cotton Wigram]] became [[Bishop of Rochester]], [[Loftus Wigram]] was a barrister and politician, and [[Octavius Wigram]] was prominent as an insurance underwriter in the [[City of London]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Courthope (officer of arms)|William Courthope]], ''Debrett's complete peerage of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland'' (1838), p. 605&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young man George Wigram obtained a commission in the army. One of his postings was to [[Brussels]]. He spent an evening exploring the [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]] battlefield and it was here he had a religious experience that changed his life. He wrote of it thus, "suddenly there came on my soul a something I had never known before. It was as if some One, Infinite and Almighty, knowing everything, full of the deepest, tenderest interest in myself, though utterly and entirely abhorring everything in, and connected with me, made known to me that He pitied and loved myself".&lt;ref&gt;D[ennett], E[dward], ed., ''Memorials of the Ministry of G. V. Wigram'', vol. 1 (Broom, London, 1880), p. iii&lt;/ref&gt; This led to his resigning his commission in the army and in 1826 he entered [[Queens College, Oxford]], with the intention of becoming an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] clergyman.

==Christian career==

At Oxford he met [[John Nelson Darby]] and [[Benjamin Wills Newton]]. Dissatisfied with the established church, Wigram and his friends left the Anglican church and helped establish non-denominational assemblies which became known as the [[Plymouth Brethren]].
He had considered joining [[Anthony Norris Groves]] and his mission to [[Baghdad]] in June 1829, but changed his mind just prior to the faith mission set off. 
After leaving Oxford University, Wigram, using his family wealth, in 1831 bought church premises in Plymouth and there established a Brethren assembly. During the 1830s Wigram also financed the establishment of assemblies in London.

Wigram had a keen interest in the original Hebrew and Greek texts of the Bible, which was of great interest to the emerging Brethren assemblies. In 1839, after years of work and financial investment, he published ''The Englishman's Greek and English Concordance to the New Testament'', followed in 1843 by ''The Englishman's Hebrew and Chaldee Concordance to the Old Testament''. He also edited the influential Brethren periodical ''Present Testimony and Original Christian Witness'' for many years (from 1849 to his death with posthumous issues running to 1881). This periodical superseded the Brethren's first magazine, ''The Christian Witness''.
Besides his literary work his oral ministry was considered to be marked by an attractive freshness: a contemporary remarked that his "very face became radiant as he spoke".&lt;ref&gt;Cornwall, E.E. (1932/33). [http://www.stempublishing.com/hymns/biographies/wigram.html ''Songs of Pilgrimage and Glory: Notes on the Hymns of Certain Hymn-Writers'']. Central Bible Truth Depot, London.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of his addresses have been preserved and published in the two volumes ''Memorials of the Ministry of G.V. Wigram'' and ''Gleanings from the Teaching of G.V. Wigram''. These were collected by the erstwhile Lewisham Road [[Baptist]] Church Minister, [[Edward Dennett]].

With Wigram's help, Darby became the most influential personality within the Brethren movement. Wigram is often referred to as being Darby's lieutenant&lt;ref&gt;Neatby, William Blair (1901). ''A History of the Plymouth Brethren'', p. 60. Hodder and Stoughton, London.&lt;/ref&gt; as he firmly supported Darby during moments of crisis. In 1845 he supported Darby in his doctrinal differences with Benjamin Wills Newton in the Brethren assembly at Plymouth. In Darby's 1848 dispute with [[George Müller]], Wigram again sided with Darby in relation to the reception of believers who had previously been in fellowship with Newton, and on Müller's reluctance to publicly denounce errors by Newton in regards to the sufferings of Christ (errors which Newton had already retracted). He also helped Darby fend off accusations of heresy, also in regards to the sufferings of Christ, in articles written in 1858 and 1866, which some considered were very similar to Newton's errors two decades earlier.

==Married life==
Wigram married Fanny Bligh in 1830, the daughter of Thomas Cherburgh Bligh whom Wigram had known as a girl in Ireland; she died in 1834. His second marriage was to Catherine, the only daughter of [[Charles_Stewart_Parnell#Family_background_and_early_life|William Parnell of Avondale]]. Their London home was 3 Howley Place, Harrow Road, London. In 1867, Wigram visited Canada. His wife Catherine joined him there two months later, but became ill and died after a short illness in Canada. The family physician was Limerick-born Dr [[Thomas Mackern]]. Wigram was 62 years old. Four years later his daughter Fanny Theodosia, child of his first wife, died.

==Travels==
Wigram travelled in the UK preaching and teaching in large Brethren assemblies. He visited [[Switzerland]] in 1853 and again in [[Vaud]] Canton in 1858. In later life he went abroad to minister to the many overseas assemblies of the Brethren, including [[Boston]] and Canada in 1867. Writing in November 1871, from [[Demerara]], [[British Guiana]], he said, "I came out in my old age, none save Himself with me". He visited Jamaica in 1872. This led to further travel, visiting Australia and [[New Zealand]] in 1873-75 and again in 1877-78.

Besides travel he maintained a wide correspondence with labourers in emerging Brethren assemblies. Among these were Louis Favez of [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref&gt;D[ennett], E[dward] (Ed., 1881). ''Memorials of the Ministry of G.V. Wigram'', vol. 3, p. 4 (26 April 1856). Broom, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hymnology==
Wigram contributed to the [[hymnology]] of the Brethren assemblies in a number of ways. He edited the anthology ''Hymns for the Poor of the Flock'' (1838). This collection contained hymns by [[Isaac Watts]], [[Charles Wesley]], [[William Cowper]], [[Thomas Kelly (hymnwriter)|Thomas Kelly]] and others; and an appendix was added, chiefly to include a number of hymns by [[Sir Edward Denny, 4th Baronet|Sir Edward Denny]] that had just been written. The four earliest of [[John Nelson Darby]]'s were also inserted. 18 years later (1856) Wigram compiled ''[[Little Flock hymnbook|A Few Hymns and some Spiritual Songs for the Little Flock]]'' to replace the previous collection. This hymnbook was revised by Darby in 1881, [[William Kelly (Bible scholar)|William Kelly]] in 1894 and again by [[T.H. Reynolds]] in 1903.

Wigram also wrote a number of hymns and these include the following
* Well may we sing, with triumph sing
* Oh, what a debt we owe
* The Person of the Christ
* What raised the wondrous thought

==Death==
Wigram died in 1879 at the age of 74 and was buried with his daughter in [[Paddington Cemetery]] by the side of Sir Edward Denny. It has been said that the large concourse of people there sang a hymn in deference to his wish expressed in his lifetime, so that all might understand that he owed all to the sovereign mercy of God. The hymn sung was: "Nothing but mercy'll do for me, / Nothing but mercy – full and free, / Of sinners chief – what but the blood / Could calm my soul, before my God".&lt;ref&gt;Cornwall, E.E. (1932/33). [http://www.stempublishing.com/hymns/biographies/wigram.html ''Songs of Pilgrimage and Glory: Notes on the Hymns of Certain Hymn-Writers'']. Central Bible Truth Depot, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Basho by Kinkoku c1820.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Portrait of [[Matsuo Bashō]] by [[Yokoi Kinkoku]], c. 1820. The calligraphy relates one of Bashō's most famous haiku poems: ''Furu ike ya / kawazu tobikomu / mizu no oto'' (An old pond / a frog jumps in / the sound of water).]]

'''{{nihongo|''Haiga''|俳画||extra=haikai drawing}}''' is a style of [[Japanese painting]] that incorporates the [[aesthetics]] of ''[[haikai]]''. ''Haiga'' are typically painted by [[haiku]] poets (''haijin''), and often accompanied by a haiku poem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Daijirin'' entry for ''haiga''|url=http://kotobank.jp/word/%E4%BF%B3%E7%94%BB|work=Kotobank dictionary aggregator website|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the poetic form it accompanied, ''haiga'' was based on simple, yet often profound, observations of the everyday world. [[Stephen Addiss]] points out that "since they are both created with the same brush and ink, adding an image to a haiku poem was&amp;nbsp;... a natural activity."&lt;ref&gt;Addiss. p14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stylistically, ''haiga'' vary widely based on the preferences and training of the individual painter, but generally show influences of formal [[Kanō school]] painting, minimalist [[Zen painting]], and [[Ōtsu-e]], while sharing much of the aesthetic attitudes of the ''[[nanga (art)|nanga]]'' tradition. Some were reproduced as [[woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]]. The subjects painted likewise vary widely, but are generally elements mentioned in the [[calligraphy]], or poetic images which add meaning or depth to that expressed by the poem. The moon is a common subject in these poems and paintings, sometimes represented by the Zen circle ''[[ensō]]'', which evokes a number of other meanings, including that of the [[Mu (negative)|void]]. Other subjects, ranging from [[Mount Fuji]] to rooftops, are frequently represented with a minimum of brushstrokes, thus evoking elegance and beauty in simplicity.

==History==
[[Image:A little cuckoo across a hydrangea(Haiga) by Yosa Buson.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A little cuckoo across a hydrangea by [[Yosa Buson]].]]

[[Nonoguchi Ryūho]] (1595–1669), a student of [[Kanō Tan'yū]], is sometimes credited{{By whom|date=November 2012}} with founding the style; though poetry was commonly accompanied by images for centuries prior, Ryūho was the first poet to regularly include paintings alongside his calligraphy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

[[Matsuo Bashō]], known worldwide as the definitive master of haiku, frequently painted as well. ''Haiga'' became a major style of painting as a result of association with his famous works of haiku.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Like his poems, Bashō's paintings are founded in a simplicity which reveals great depth, complementing the poems they are paired with. Towards the end of his life, he studied painting under [[Morikawa Kyoriku]], his pupil in poetry; the works of both men benefited from the exchange, and a number of works were produced combining Morikawa's painting with Bashō's poetry and calligraphy.

Composing haiku, and painting accompanying pictures, was a common pastime of [[Edo period]] aesthetes, who would pursue these activities in their spare time, or at friendly gatherings as a communal form of entertainment. The famous novelist [[Ihara Saikaku]] was one of many people not normally associated with either poetry or painting, who took part. By contrast, the ''[[nanga (art)|nanga]]'' painter [[Yosa Buson]], widely considered second only to Bashō as a master of haiku, is said to be "the only artist to be included in surveys both of great poets and great painters in Japanese history."&lt;ref&gt;Addiss. p15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other schools of painting which maintained a standard set of styles passed from master to apprentice, the genre of ''haiga'' encompassed a variety of artists with different approaches. Some, like Bashō, were primarily poets, accompanying their compositions with simple sketches,{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} while others, like Buson, were primarily painters, devoting more space and centrality of focus to the image.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Maruyama Goshun]] and [[Ki Baitei]] were among those who tended to paint portraits of poets and other figures in a relatively quick, loose style which looks somewhat [[cartoon]]ish to the modern eye. Some ''haiga'' paintings, such as those by [[Morikawa Kyoriku]], reflect the formal training of the artists, while others, like those by [[Nakahara Nantenbō]], reflect the artist's background in [[Zen]].

One overall trend that developed over time, despite this wide variety, was a shift from the circles of literati (''bunjin'') painters to the orbit of the [[Shijō school]] of the naturalistic painter [[Maruyama Ōkyo]]. This move was effected primarily by Maruyama Goshun,{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} and can be seen as well in the works of [[Yamaguchi Soken]]. Some later painters, such as [[Takebe Sōchō]], were influenced by ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' styles, and used color in highly detailed works.

Though traditional-style ''haiga'' are still produced today, contemporary artists experiment with the style, coupling haiku with digital imagery, photography, and other media.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In [[mathematical optimization]], '''Himmelblau's function''' is a multi-modal function, used to test the performance of [[optimization algorithm]]s.
The function is defined by:

: &lt;math&gt;f(x, y) = (x^2+y-11)^2 + (x+y^2-7)^2.\quad&lt;/math&gt;

It has one local maximum at &lt;math&gt;x = -0.270845 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y = -0.923039 &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f(x,y) = 181.617 &lt;/math&gt;, and four identical local minima:

* &lt;math&gt;f(3.0, 2.0) = 0.0, \quad&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(-2.805118, 3.131312) = 0.0, \quad&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(-3.779310, -3.283186) = 0.0, \quad&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;f(3.584428, -1.848126) = 0.0. \quad&lt;/math&gt;

The locations of all the [[Maxima and minima|minima]] can be found analytically. However, because they are roots of [[cubic polynomial]]s, when written in terms of radicals, the expressions are somewhat complicated.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The function is named after [[David Mautner Himmelblau]] (1924–2011), who introduced it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Himmelblau |first=D. |title=Applied Nonlinear Programming |location= |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=1972 |isbn=0-07-028921-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kirk R. Smith''' is an expert on the health and [[global warming|climate]] effects of household energy use in developing nations. He is currently a professor of Global Environmental Health at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where his research focuses on the relationships among environmental quality, health, resource use, climate, development, and policy in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://ehs.sph.berkeley.edu/people/smithk.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Smith contributed a great deal to the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)]], and the work of the IPCC (including the contributions of many scientists) was recognised by the joint award of the [[2007 Nobel Peace Prize|2007]] [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. Smith is a recipient of the 2012 [[Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement]] for his work with cookstoves, health, and climate. He is also credited with designing and implementing the first [[randomized controlled trial]] of the health effects of [[indoor air pollution in developing countries|indoor air pollution (IAP)]] from [[cook stove|cookstoves]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humanrights.gov/2012/09/26/fact-sheet-global-alliance-for-clean-cookstoves-progress/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Smith grew up in the [[California]] [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]], where he attended the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Here, he received his Bachelor of Arts (1968) in [[Physics]] and [[Astronomy]], his [[Master of Public Health]] (1972) in Environmental Health Sciences, and his [[PhD|Doctorate (PhD)]] (1977) in Biomedical and Environmental Health with a focus on Energy &amp; Environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://ehs.sph.berkeley.edu/krsmith/&lt;/ref&gt; His studies at Berkeley led to developments in coal-ash recycling and nuclear risk assessment, and were conducted under the advisorship of the current [[Office of Science and Technology Policy|Science Advisor]] to U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], [[John Holdren]]. After finishing his PhD, Smith moved to Hawaii where he founded the Energy Program at the East-West Center. He led the center's work on energy research problems in the Asia-Pacific regions until 1985, when he became the coordinator for environmental risk research. In 1995, Smith returned to [[UC Berkeley]] where he joined the faculty at the [[UC Berkeley School of Public Health]]. He is currently a Professor of Global Environmental Health, the founder and co-Director of the university's Global Health and Environment Program, and Associate Director for International Programs at the Center for Occupational and Environmental Health.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tylerprize.usc.edu/laureates.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|astronomical observation posts|Observatory}}
[[Image:RAF Observation Post Bunker.jpg|right|thumb|An observation post for airfield defense coordination.]]

An '''observation post''' (commonly abbreviated '''OP'''), temporary or fixed, is a position from which [[soldier]]s can watch enemy movements, to warn of approaching soldiers (such as in [[trench warfare]]), or to [[Artillery observer|direct artillery fire]]. In strict military terminology, an observation post is ''any'' preselected position from which observations are to be made - this may include very temporary installations such as a vehicle parked as a roadside checkpoint, or even an airborne aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=386 DoD News Briefing, February 15, 1996 1:30 pm EST] (from a [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] news briefing. Accessed 2008-06-21.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
[[Image:Disguisetactics.jpg|thumb|right|[[German Empire|German]] [[World War I]] observation post disguised as a tree.]]

When selecting a (temporary) observation post, trained troops are to avoid obvious and conspicuous locations such as hilltops, [[water tower]]s or other isolated terrain features, and to ensure that the observation post can be reached via a [[:wikt:conceal|concealed]] route. This is especially important as the observer in the post should be rotated every 20–30 minutes, as [[alertness|vigilance]] decreases markedly after such a time.&lt;ref name="IM"/&gt; 

Observation posts should be manned with at least two personnel (more, for defense and observer rotation, if the post is to be retained for longer durations), and should be provided a means of communication with their [[chain of command]], preferably by phone instead of by radio.&lt;ref name="IM"&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/accp/in0202/le2l.htm#pl Observation posts] (from the ''Mechanized Infantry Squad Operations (Bradley)'' course manual, [[United States Army Infantry School]], 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

Often being positioned in secret very close to the enemy, an observation post is usually a small construct, often consisting largely of [[Military camouflage|camouflage]] materials and possibly weather cover. However, where [[Front (military)|frontlines]] are expected to be stable for a longer time, an observation post (or '''ground observation post''') may develop into a [[bunker]]-like installation.

It is not unusual for soldiers to occupy a 'hide' for long periods of time. To avoid detection they have to remove all their own waste, this is achieved with the aid of clingfilm, plastic bags and empty water bottles.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

One example of makeshift observation posts is [[Gaza Baptist Church]], which was commandeered by both [[Fatah]] and [[Hamas]] troops during the [[Fatah–Hamas conflict]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6159">The '''Oxyrhynchus Gospels''' are two fragmentary [[manuscript]]s discovered among the rich finds of discarded [[papyri]] at [[Oxyrhynchus]] in Egypt. Unknown to most laymen, they throw light on early [[non-canonical]] [[Gospel]] traditions.

==Oxyrhynchus 840==
'''Oxyrhynchus 840''' (P. Oxy. V 840), found in 1905, is a single small [[vellum parchment]] leaf with 45 lines of text written on both sides in a tiny neat hand that dates it to the 4th century, almost square, less than 10&amp;nbsp;cm across. It is kept at the [[Bodleian Library]], MS. Gr. th. g. 11 (P).&lt;ref name="bodl"&gt;{{cite web|title=MSS. Greek theology (Gr. th.)|url=http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/medieval/greek/gr-th.html|publisher=[[Bodleian Library]]|accessdate=24 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text probably predates 200, but no more is determinable from this evidence. In his introduction in ''The Complete Gospels'', [[Philip Sellew]] notes that this fragment was likely a [[amulet|talisman]] text, kept as an [[amulet]], perhaps worn around the neck. [[Michael J. Kruger]] who did his PhD dissertation on this fragment &lt;ref&gt;[[Larry Hurtado]], Lord Jesus Christ, Eerdman Publishing 2003, p 439, footnote 40&lt;/ref&gt; concludes that this could not be an amulet but rather a miniature [[codex]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael J Kruger, [[Journal of Theological Studies]] 53 (2003), p 93&lt;/ref&gt; The text itself has been dated to the first half of the second century. Sellew calls it "similar to the New Testament gospels in its style and tone."

The fragment begins with the end of a warning to an evildoer who plans ahead, yet fails to take the next life into account. There follows sections of a narrative unparalleled in any other known gospel tradition, about Jesus' encounter with "a Pharisee, a leading priest" who tries to order Jesus and the disciples out of the Temple as ritually unclean. Jesus responds by contrasting ritual cleanliness, gotten by bathing with water used by dogs and pigs, like a harlot, against the life-giving water that comes down from heaven in baptism.

Jesus is called "[[wiktionary:Savior|Savior]]" ({{lang-el|Σωτήρ}}), which is rare in the New Testament, but not unparalleled.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. ''Luke'' 1:69, 2:11; ''John'' 4:42; ''Acts'' 5:31, 13:23&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the fragment also believes that laymen have to change their clothes to enter the temple, for which there is no other evidence. The author is distinctly hostile to Judaism, but as he knows little about it, the text is presumably not from Judea; the author's vague grasp of details of [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] rituals have suggested a [[Johannine]] circle, perhaps in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Sellew's note to 2:2; for Syria, see [http://www.maplenet.net/~trowbridge/oxy840.htm Geoff Trowbridge, "The Oxyrhynchus 840 Gospel"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oxyrhynchus 1224==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Jesus Seminar]] --&gt;
'''Oxyrhynchus 1224''' (P. Oxy. X 1224), now at the [[Bodleian Library]], MS. Gr. th. e. 8 (P),&lt;ref name="bodl" /&gt; consists of two small [[papyrus]] fragments from the late 3rd or early 4th century. It contains six passages, each about a sentence. Two of the longer ones are parallel to Mark 2:17 and Luke 9:50, but the differences in phrasing show they are textually independent of the Gospels. A precise date for composition is unknown; 50 is possible,&lt;ref&gt;Miller's introduction, ''Complete Gospels'', p.416, and notes to fragments 5 and 6.&lt;/ref&gt; though a date of around 150 AD. is more widely accepted by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Craig A. Evans, Ph.D., Fabricating Jesus: How Modern Scholars Distort the Gospels, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Dominic Crossan]] notes the mutilated condition in his introduction to the fragmentary text in ''The Complete Gospels'' resulting in highly conjectural reconstructions of the text, which, however, "does not seem to be dependent on the New Testament gospels.... As an independent gospel, it belongs, insofar as its fragmentary state allows us to see, not with discourse gospels involving the risen Jesus (e.g., the ''[[Secret Book of James]]'' and the ''[[Gospel of Mary]]''), but with sayings gospels involving the earthly Jesus (e.g., [[Q document]] and the ''[[Gospel of Thomas]]''). Crossan suggests that the document might have been written as early as the mid-first century.

'''''Philip Dru: Administrator: A Story of Tomorrow, 1920-1935''''' is a futuristic [[political novel]] published anonymously in 1912 by author [[Edward M. House|Edward Mandell House]], an American diplomat, politician, and presidential foreign policy advisor.  According to historians, House highly prized his work and gave a copy of ''Dru'' to his closest political ally, [[Woodrow Wilson]], to read while on a trip to Bermuda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=g1IgBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74 Colonel House: A Biography of Woodrow Wilson's Silent Partner]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4jcL20ZS_KUC&amp;pg=PA53 Woodrow Wilson's Right Hand: The Life of Colonel Edward M.

==Book reviews==
Historian [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] wrote: "Oddly enough, in 1911 he [House] had published a political novel, ''Philip Dru: Administrator'', in which a benevolent dictator imposed a corporate income tax, abolished the protective tariff, and broke up the 'credit trust'—a remarkable adumbration of [[Woodrow Wilson|[Woodrow] Wilson]] and his first term."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson | first = Paul |authorlink = Paul Johnson (writer) | title = A History of the American People | publisher = HarperPerennial | location = New York | year = 1999 | pages = 635–636| isbn = 0060930349 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Billie Jensen, a historian from the [[University of Kansas]] noted that "''Philip Dru was obviously an expression both of House's ambition and his political dreams and it was an expression of the ideas of the man who had an impressive amount of influence on Woodrow Wilson.  Seldom have the elements of a utopia been implemented so soon as the reforms of Philip Dru were; seldom has a utopian reformer been as influential as House was.  For these reasons, Philip Dru is a significant political document.''&lt;ref name=Jensen&gt;[https://libprdojsap.lib.ku.edu/amerstud/article/view/2434 Philip Dru, The Blueprint of a Presidential Adviser]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book review for [[The New York Times]], [[Walter Lippmann]] wrote of the novel and its anonymous author that "''if the author is really a man of affairs, this is an extraordinarily interesting book''".&lt;ref&gt;[*[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A07E5DB1E3AE633A2575BC0A9649D946396D6CF AMERICA'S FUTURE; Pictured in a Decidedly Quaint Modern Novel], [[Walter Lippmann]], December 8, 1912]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''pioneer organism'''—also called a '''disaster taxon'''—is an [[organism]] that populates a region after a (short-term) natural disaster, mass extinction, or any other event that kills off most life in that area.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/275/1636/759.full.pdf |author1=Sahney, S.  |author2=Benton, M.J.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2008 | title=Recovery from the most profound mass extinction of all time | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | doi=10.1098/rspb.2007.1370 | volume = 275 | pages = 759–65|format=PDF | pmid=18198148 | issue=1636 | pmc=2596898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural disaster==
After a natural disaster, common pioneer organisms include [[lichen]]s and [[algae]]. [[Moss]]es usually follow lichens in colonization, but cannot serve as pioneer organisms.  Pioneer organisms modify their environment and establish conditions that accommodate other organisms. In some circumstances, other organisms can be considered pioneer organisms. Birds are usually the first to inhabit newly created islands, and seeds, such as the [[coconut]], may also be the first arrivals on barren soil.

==Extinction event==
Since the resolution of the fossil record is low, pioneer organisms are often identified as those that lived within hundreds, thousands, or a million years of the extinction event. For example, after the [[Permian–Triassic extinction event]] 252 million years ago, [[Lystrosaurus]], a tusked-reptile, was considered a disaster taxon.&lt;ref name="SahneyBenton2008"/&gt;

'''Quantum cognition''' is an emerging field which applies the mathematical formalism of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] to model cognitive phenomena such as information processing by the human brain, [[language]], [[decision making]], [[human memory]], [[concept]]s and conceptual reasoning, human [[judgment]], and [[perception]].&lt;ref name=Khrennikov2010&gt;
Khrennikov, A. "Ubiquitous Quantum Structure: from Psychology to Finances". Springer, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BusemeyerBruza2012&gt;Busemeyer, J., Bruza, P. (2012), Quantum Models of Cognition and Decision, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pothos, E. M., &amp; Busemeyer, J. R. (2013). Can quantum probability provide a new direction for cognitive modeling. Behavioral and Brain Sciences,36,255–274.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wang, Z., Busemeyer, J. R., Atmanspacher, H., &amp; Pothos, E. M. (2013). The potential of using quantum theory to build models of cognition. Topics in Cognitive Science, 5(4), 672-688.&lt;/ref&gt; The field clearly distinguishes itself from the [[quantum mind]] as it is not reliant on the hypothesis that there is something micro-physical quantum mechanical about the brain. Quantum cognition is based on the quantum-like paradigm&lt;ref&gt;Khrennikov, A. 2006. Quantum-like brain: "Interference of minds"  Biosystems, vol. 84, no. 3, pp. 225–241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khrennikov, A. Information Dynamics in Cognitive, Psychological, Social, and Anomalous Phenomena (Fundamental Theories of Physics) (Volume 138), Kluwer, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; or generalized quantum paradigm&lt;ref&gt;Atmanspacher, H., Römer, H., &amp; Walach, H. (2002). Weak quantum theory: Complementarity and entanglement in physics and beyond. Foundations of Physics, 32(3), 379–406.&lt;/ref&gt; or quantum structure paradigm&lt;ref&gt;Aerts, D. &amp; Aerts, S. (1994) Applications of quantum statistics in psychological studies of decision processes. Foundations of Science, 1, 85–97.&lt;/ref&gt; that information processing by complex systems such as the brain, taking into account contextual dependence of information and probabilistic reasoning, can be mathematically described in the framework of quantum information and quantum probability theory.

Quantum cognition uses the mathematical formalism of quantum theory to inspire and formalize models of cognition that aim to be an advance over models based on traditional classical [[probability theory]]. The field focuses on modeling phenomena in [[cognitive science]] that have resisted traditional techniques or where traditional models seem to have reached a barrier (e.g., human memory&lt;ref name=Bruza2009&gt;Bruza, P., Kitto, K., Nelson, D., &amp; McEvoy, C. (2009). Is there something quantum-like about the human mental lexicon?. ''Journal of Mathematical Psychology,'' 53(5), 362–377.&lt;/ref&gt;), and modeling preferences in [[decision theory]] that seem paradoxical from a traditional rational point of view (e.g., preference reversals&lt;ref&gt;Lambert Mogiliansky, A., Zamir, S., &amp; Zwirn, H. (2009). Type indeterminacy: A model of the KT (Kahneman–Tversky)-man. Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 53(5), 349–361.&lt;/ref&gt;). Since the use of a quantum-theoretic framework is for modeling purposes, the identification of quantum structures in cognitive phenomena does not presuppose the existence of microscopic quantum processes in the human brain.&lt;ref name=deBarrosSuppes2009&gt;de Barros, J. A., Suppes, P. (2009). Quantum mechanics, interference, and the brain. ''Journal of Mathematical Psychology 53'' (5), 306–313.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main subjects of research ==

===Quantum-like models of information processing ("quantum-like brain")===
The brain is definitely a macroscopic physical system operating on the scales (of time, space, temperature) which differ crucially from the corresponding quantum scales. (The macroscopic quantum physical phenomena such as e.g. the Bose-Einstein condensate are also characterized by the special conditions which are definitely not fulfilled in the brain.) In particular, the brain is simply too hot to be able perform the real quantum information processing, i.e., to use the quantum carriers of information such as photons, ions, electrons. As is commonly accepted in brain science, the basic unit of information processing is a neuron. It is clear that a neuron cannot be in the superposition of two states: firing and non-firing. Hence, it cannot produce superposition playing the basic role in the quantum information processing. Superpositions of mental states are created by complex networks of neurons (and these are classical neural networks). Quantum cognition community states that the activity of such neural networks can produce effects which are formally described as interference (of probabilities) and entanglement. In principle, the community does not try to create the concrete models of quantum (-like) representation of information in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Khrennikov, A. 2008. The Quantum-Like Brain on the Cognitive and Subcognitive Time Scales. Journal of Consciousness Studies, vol. 15, no.7&lt;/ref&gt;

The quantum cognition project is based on the observation that various cognitive phenomena are more adequately described by quantum information theory and quantum probability than by the corresponding classical theories, see examples below. Thus the quantum formalism is considered as an operational formalism describing nonclassical processing of probabilistic data. Recent derivations of the complete quantum formalism from simple operational principles for representation of information supports the foundations of quantum cognition. The subjective probability viewpoint on quantum probability which was developed by C. Fuchs and collaborators&lt;ref&gt;Caves, C. M., Fuchs, C. A., &amp; Schack, R. (2002). Quantum probabilities as Bayesian probabilities. Physical review A, 65(2), 022305.&lt;/ref&gt; also supports the quantum cognition approach, especially using of quantum probabilities to describe the process of decision making.

Although at the moment we cannot present the concrete neurophysiological mechanisms of creation of the quantum-like representation of information in the brain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Van den Noort, M., Lim, S., &amp; Bosch, P. (2016)|title=On the need to unify neuroscience and physics|journal=Neuroimmunology and Neuroinflammation |volume=3 |pages=271–273|url=http://nnjournal.net/article/view/1855/1275}}&lt;/ref&gt; we can present general informational considerations supporting the idea that information processing in the brain matches with quantum information and probability. Here, contextuality is the key word, see the monograph of Khrennikov&lt;ref name=Khrennikov2010/&gt; for detailed representation of this viewpoint. Quantum mechanics is fundamentally contextual.&lt;ref&gt;Khrennikov, A., 
"Contextual Approach to Quantum Formalism" (Fundamental Theories of Physics 160), Springer, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum systems do not have objective properties which can be defined independently of measurement context. (As was pointed by N. Bohr, the whole experimental arrangement must be taken into account.) Contextuality implies existence of incompatible mental variables, violation of the classical law of total probability and (constructive and destructive) interference effects. Thus the quantum cognition approach can be considered as an attempt to formalize contextuality of mental processes by using the mathematical apparatus of quantum mechanics.

===Decision making===
Suppose a person is given an opportunity to play two rounds of the following gamble: a coin toss will determine whether the subject wins $200 or loses $100. Suppose the subject has decided to play the first round, and does so. Some subjects are then given the result (win or lose) of the first round, while other subjects are not yet given any information about the results. The experimenter then asks whether the subject wishes to play the second round. Performing this experiment with real subjects gives the following results:

# When subjects believe they won the first round, the majority of subjects choose to play again on the second round.
# When subjects believe they lost the first round, the majority of subjects choose to play again on the second round.

Given these two separate choices, according to the ''sure thing'' principle of rational decision theory, they should also play the second round even if they don’t know or think about the outcome of the first round.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, L. J. (1954). ''The Foundations of Statistics''. John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; 
But, experimentally, when subjects are not told the results of the first round, the majority of them decline to play a second round.&lt;ref&gt;Tversky, A., Shafir, E. (1992). The disjunction effect in choice under uncertainty. ''Psychological Science 3'', 305–309.&lt;/ref&gt;
This finding violates the law of total probability, yet it can be explained as a [[quantum interference]] effect in a manner similar to the explanation for the results from [[double-slit experiment]] in quantum physics.&lt;ref name=BusemeyerBruza2012/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pothos, E. M., &amp; Busemeyer, J. R. (2009). A quantum probability explanation for violations of ‘rational’decision theory. Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 276(1665), 2171–2178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YukalovSornette2009&gt;Yukalov, V. I., &amp; Sornette, D. (2011). Decision theory with prospect interference and entanglement. Theory and Decision, 70(3), 283–328.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar violations of the sure-thing principle are seen in empirical studies of the [[Prisoner's Dilemma]] and have likewise been modeled in terms of quantum interference.&lt;ref&gt;Musser, G. (2012). A New Enlightenment. ''Scientific American'' 307(5), 76–81. {{doi|10.1038/scientificamerican1112-76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above deviations from classical rational expectations in agents’ decisions under uncertainty produce well known paradoxes in behavioral economics, that is, the [[Allais paradox|Allais]], [[Ellsberg paradox|Ellsberg]] and Machina paradoxes.&lt;ref&gt;Allais, M. (1953) Le comportement de l’homme rationnel devant le risque: Critique des postulats et axiomes de l’ecole Americaine. ''Econometrica 21'', 503–546.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellsberg, D. (1961). Risk, ambiguity, and the Savage axioms. ''Quarterly Journal of Economics 75'', 643–669.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Machina, M. J. (2009). Risk, ambiguity, and the dark-dependence axioms. ''American Econonomical Review 99'', 385–392.&lt;/ref&gt; These deviations can be explained if one assumes that the overall conceptual landscape influences the subject’s choice in a neither predictable nor controllable way. A decision process is thus an intrinsically contextual process, hence it cannot be modeled in a single Kolmogorovian probability space, which justifies the employment of quantum probability models in decision theory. More explicitly, the paradoxical situations above can be represented in a unified Hilbert space formalism where human behavior under uncertainty is explained in terms of genuine quantum aspects, namely, superposition, interference, contextuality and incompatibility.&lt;ref&gt;Aerts, D., Sozzo, S., Tapia, J. (2012). A quantum model for the Ellsberg and Machina paradoxes. In ''Quantum Interaction 2012'', Busemeyer, J., Dubois, F., Lambert-Mogilansky, A., editors, 48–59, LNCS 7620 (Springer, Berlin).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aerts, D., Sozzo, S., Tapia, J. (2013). Identifying quantum structures in the Ellsberg paradox. ''ArXiv: 1302.3850v1 [physics.soc-ph]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;La Mura, P. (2009). Projective expected utility. Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 53(5), 408–414.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=YukalovSornette2009/&gt;

Considering automated decision making, quantum [[decision trees]] have different structure compared to classical decision trees. Data can be analyzed to see if a quantum decision tree model fits the data better.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

===Human probability judgments===
Quantum probability provides a new way to explain human probability judgment errors including the conjunction and disjunction errors.&lt;ref&gt;Tversky, A., Kahneman, D. (1983). Extensional versus intuitive reasoning: The conjunction fallacy in probability judgment. ''Psychological Review 90'', 293–315.&lt;/ref&gt; A conjunction error occurs when a person judges the probability of a likely event L ''and'' an unlikely event U to be greater than the unlikely event U; a disjunction error occurs when a person judges the probability of a likely event L to be greater than the probability of the likely event L ''or'' an unlikely event U. Quantum probability theory is a generalization of [[Bayesian probability]] theory because it is based on a set of [[von Neumann]] axioms that relax some of the classic [[Kolmogorov]] axioms.&lt;ref name=Bond2018&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bond|first=Rachael L.|last2=He|first2=Yang-Hui|last3=Ormerod|first3=Thomas C.|date=2018|title=A quantum framework for likelihood ratios|journal=[[International Journal of Quantum Information]]|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1850002|arxiv=1508.00936|doi=10.1142/s0219749918500028|issn=0219-7499|via=|bibcode=2018IJQI...1650002B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quantum model introduces a new fundamental concept to cognition—the compatibility versus incompatibility of questions and the effect this can have on the sequential order of judgments. Quantum probability provides a simple account of conjunction and disjunction errors as well as many other findings such as order effects on probability judgments.&lt;ref name=Aerts2009&gt;Aerts D. (2009a). Quantum structure in cognition. ''Journal of Mathematical Psychology 53'', 314–348.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Busemeyer, J. R., Pothos, E., Franco, R., Trueblood, J. S. (2011). A quantum theoretical explanation for probability judgment ‘errors’. ''Psychological Review 118'', 193–218.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trueblood, J. S., &amp; Busemeyer, J. R. (2011). A quantum probability account of order effects in inference. Cognitive science, 35(8), 1518–1552.&lt;/ref&gt;

The liar paradox - The contextual influence of a human subject on the truth behavior of a cognitive entity is explicitly exhibited by the so-called [[liar paradox]], that is, the truth value of a sentence like "this sentence is false". One can show that the true-false state of this paradox is represented in a complex Hilbert space, while the typical oscillations between true and false are dynamically described by the Schrödinger equation.&lt;ref&gt;Aerts, D., Broekaert, J., Smets, S. (1999). The liar paradox in a quantum mechanical perspective. ''Foundations of Science 4'', 115–132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aerts, D., Aerts, S., Broekaert, J., Gabora, L. (2000). The violation of Bell inequalities in the macroworld. ''Foundations of Physics 30'', 1387–1414.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge representation===
Concepts are basic cognitive phenomena, which provide the content for inference, explanation, and language understanding. [[Cognitive psychology]] has researched different approaches for [[Concept learning|understanding concepts]] including exemplars, prototypes, and [[neural networks]], and different fundamental problems have been identified, such as the experimentally tested non classical behavior for the conjunction and disjunction of concepts, more specifically the Pet-Fish problem or guppy effect,&lt;ref&gt;Osherson, D. N., Smith, E. E. (1981) On the adequacy of prototype theory as a theory of concepts. Cognition 9, 35–58&lt;/ref&gt; and the overextension and underextension of typicality and membership weight for conjunction and disjunction.&lt;ref name=Hampton1988a&gt;Hampton, J. A. (1988a). Overextension of conjunctive concepts: Evidence for a unitary model for concept typicality and class inclusion.

''Memory &amp; Cognition 16'', 579–591.&lt;/ref&gt; By and large, quantum cognition has drawn on quantum theory in three ways to model concepts.

The large amount of data collected by Hampton&lt;ref name=Hampton1988a/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hampton1988b/&gt; on the combination of two concepts can be modeled in a specific quantum-theoretic framework in Fock space where the observed deviations from classical set (fuzzy set) theory, the above-mentioned over- and under- extension of membership weights, are explained in terms of contextual interactions, superposition, interference, entanglement and emergence.&lt;ref name=Aerts2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aerts, D.

===Human memory===
The hypothesis that there may be something quantum-like about the human mental function was put forward with the quantum entanglement formula which attempted to model the effect that when a word’s associative network is activated during study in memory experiment, it behaves like a quantum-entangled system.&lt;ref name=Bruza2009/&gt; Models of cognitive agents and memory based on quantum collectives have been proposed by [[Subhash Kak]].&lt;ref&gt;Kak, S.

Observability and computability in physics, Quantum Matter 3: 172–176, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semantic analysis and information retrieval===
The research in (iv) had a deep impact on the understanding and initial development of a formalism to obtain semantic information when dealing with concepts, their combinations and variable contexts in a corpus of unstructured documents. This conundrum of [[natural language processing]] (NLP) and [[information retrieval]] (IR) on the web – and data bases in general – can be addressed using the mathematical formalism of quantum theory. As basic steps, (a) the seminal book "The Geometry of Information Retrieval" by K. Van Rijsbergen&lt;ref&gt;Van Rijsbergen, K. (2004). ''The Geometry of Information Retrieval''. Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced a quantum structure approach to IR, (b) Widdows and Peters utilised a quantum logical negation for a concrete search system,&lt;ref name=WiddowsPeters2003/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Widdows, D. (2006). Geometry and meaning. ''CSLI Publications'', University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Aerts and Czachor identified quantum structure in semantic space theories, such as [[latent semantic analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Aerts, D., Czachor, M. (2004). Quantum aspects of semantic analysis and symbolic artificial intelligence. ''Journal of Physics A 37'', L123-L132.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the employment of techniques and procedures induced from the mathematical formalisms of quantum theory – Hilbert space, quantum logic and probability, non-commutative algebras, etc. – in fields such as IR and NLP, has produced significant results.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rosoka.com/sites/default/files/ParserlessExtraction.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human perception===
Bi-stable perceptual phenomena is a fascinating topic in the area of perception. If a stimulus has an ambiguous interpretation, such as a [[Necker cube]], the interpretation tends to oscillate across time. Quantum models have been developed to predict the time period between oscillations and how these periods change with frequency of measurement.&lt;ref&gt;Atmanspacher, H., Filk, T., Romer, H. (2004). Quantum zeno features of bi-stable perception. ''Biological Cybernetics 90'', 33–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum theory and an appropriate model have been developed by Elio Conte to account for interference effects obtained with measurements of ambiguous figures.&lt;ref name=Conte&gt;Conte, E., Todarello, O., Federici, A., Vitiello, F., Lopane, M., Khrennikov, A., Zbilut, J. P. (2007).

====Gestalt perception====
{{confusing|Section|date=June 2013}}

There are apparent similarities between [[Gestalt perception]] and quantum theory. In an article discussing the application of Gestalt to chemistry, [[Anton Amann]] writes: "Quantum mechanics does ''not'' explain Gestalt perception, of course, but in quantum mechanics and Gestalt psychology there exist almost isomorphic conceptions and problems:

*Similarly as with the Gestalt concept, the shape of a quantum object does ''not'' a priori exist but it depends on the interaction of this quantum object with the environment (for example: an [[Observer (quantum physics)|observer or a measurement apparatus]]).
*Quantum mechanics and Gestalt perception are organized in a holistic way. Subentities do ''not'' necessarily exist in a distinct, individual sense.
*In quantum mechanics and Gestalt perception ''objects have to be created'' by elimination of holistic correlations with the 'rest of the world'."&lt;ref name="amann-1993"&gt;[[Anton Amann]]: The Gestalt Problem in Quantum Theory: Generation of Molecular Shape by the Environment, Synthese, vol. 97, no. 1 (1993), pp. 125–156, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20117832 jstor 20117832]&lt;/ref&gt;
Amann comments: "The structural similarities between Gestalt perception and quantum mechanics are on a level of a parable, but even parables can teach us something, for example, that quantum mechanics is more than just production of numerical results or that the Gestalt concept is more than just a silly idea, incompatible with atomistic conceptions."&lt;ref name="amann-1993"/&gt;

===Quantum-like models of cognition in economics and finance===
The assumption that information processing by the agents of the market follows the laws of quantum information theory and quantum probability was actively explored by many authors, e.g., E. Haven, O. Choustova, A. Khrennikov, see the book of E. Haven and A. Khrennikov,&lt;ref&gt;Haven E. and Khrennikov A.
Quantum Social Science, Cambridge University Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; for detailed bibliography. We can mention, e.g., the Bohmian model of dynamics of prices of shares in which the quantum(-like) potential is generated by expectations of agents of the financial market and, hence, it has the mental nature. This approach can be used to model real financial data, see the book of E. Haven and A. Khrennikov (2012).

===Application of theory of open quantum systems to decision making and "cell's cognition"===
An isolated quantum system is an idealized theoretical entity. In reality interactions with environment have to be taken into account. This is the subject of theory of open quantum systems. Cognition is also fundamentally contextual. The brain is a kind of (self-)observer which makes context dependent decisions. Mental environment plays a crucial role in information processing. Therefore, it is natural to apply theory of open quantum systems to describe the process of decision making as the result of quantum-like dynamics of the mental state of a system interacting with an environment. The description of the process of decision making is mathematically equivalent to the description of the process of decoherence. This idea was explored in a series of works of the multidisciplinary group of researchers at Tokyo University of Science.&lt;ref&gt;
Asano, M., Ohya, M., Tanaka, Y., Basieva, I., Khrennikov, A., 2011.
Quantum-like model of brain's functioning: Decision making from decoherence. Journal of Theoretical Biologyvol. 281, no. 1, pp. 56–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
Asano, M., Basieva, I., Khrennikov, A., Ohya, M., Yamato, I. 2013.
Non-Kolmogorovian Approach to the Context-Dependent Systems Breaking the Classical Probability Law
Foundations of Physics, vol. 43, no 7, pp. 895–911. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Since in the quantum-like approach the formalism of quantum mechanics is considered as a purely operational formalism, it can be applied to the description of information processing by any biological system, i.e., not only by human beings.

Operationally it is very convenient to consider e.g. a cell as a kind of decision maker processing information in the quantum information framework. This idea was explored in a series of papers of the Swedish-Japanese research group using the methods of theory of open quantum systems: genes expressions were modeled as decision making in the process of interaction with environment.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
Here is a short history of applying the formalisms of quantum theory to topics in [[psychology]]. Ideas for applying quantum formalisms to cognition first appeared in the 1990s by [[Diederik Aerts]] and his collaborators Jan Broekaert, Sonja Smets and Liane Gabora, by Harald Atmanspacher, Robert Bordley, and Andrei Khrennikov. A special issue on ''Quantum Cognition and Decision'' appeared in the [[Journal of Mathematical Psychology]] (2009, vol 53.), which planted a flag for the field. A few books related to quantum cognition have been published including those by Khrennikov (2004, 2010), Ivancivic and Ivancivic (2010), Busemeyer and Bruza (2012), E. Conte (2012). The first Quantum Interaction workshop was held at [[Stanford]] in 2007 organized by Peter Bruza, William Lawless, C. J. van Rijsbergen, and Don Sofge as part of the 2007 [[AAAI]] Spring Symposium Series. This was followed by workshops at [[Oxford]] in 2008, [[Saarbrücken]] in 2009, at the 2010 AAAI Fall Symposium Series held in [[Washington, D.C.]], 2011 in [[Aberdeen]], 2012 in [[Paris]], and 2013 in [[Leicester]]. Tutorials also were presented annually beginning in 2007 until 2013 at the annual meeting of the [[Cognitive Science Society]]. A ''Special Issue on Quantum models of Cognition'' appeared in 2013 ''Topics in Cognitive Science.''

It was suggested by theoretical physicists [[David Bohm]] and [[Basil Hiley]] that [[Thought#The mind-body problem|mind and matter]] both [[Implicate and explicate order according to David Bohm#A common grounding for consciousness and matter|emerge from an "implicate order"]].&lt;ref&gt;B.J. Hiley: ''Particles, fields, and observers'', Volume I The Origins of Life, Part 1 Origin and Evolution of Life, Section II The Physical and Chemical Basis of Life, pp. 87–106 ([http://www.bbk.ac.uk/tpru/BasilHiley/Frontiersoflife.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basil Hiley#Mind and matter|Bohm and Hiley's approach to mind and matter]] is supported by philosopher [[Paavo Pylkkänen]].&lt;ref&gt;Basil J. Hiley, Paavo Pylkkänen: ''Naturalizing the mind in a quantum framework''. In Paavo Pylkkänen and Tere Vadén (eds.): Dimensions of conscious experience, Advances in Consciousness Research, Volume 37, John Benjamins B.V., 2001, {{ISBN|90-272-5157-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=CCX1NhhpQNQC&amp;pg=PA119 pages 119–144]&lt;/ref&gt; Pylkkänen underlines "unpredictable, uncontrollable, indivisible and non-logical" features of conscious thought and draws parallels to a philosophical movement some call "post-phenomenology", in particular to [[Pauli Pylkkö]]'s notion of the "aconceptual experience", an unstructured, unarticulated and pre-logical experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Paavo Pylkkänen|title=Can quantum analogies help us to understand the process of thought?|journal=Mind &amp; Matter|volume=12|number=1|pages=61–91|url=http://philpapers.org/archive/PYLCQA.1.pdf}} p.&amp;nbsp;83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematical techniques of both Conte's group and Hiley's group involve the use of [[Clifford algebra#Physics|Clifford algebras]]. These algebras account for "non-commutativity" of thought processes (for an example, ''see:'' [[Commutative property#Noncommutative operations in everyday life|noncommutative operations in everyday life]]).

However, an area that needs to be investigated is the concept lateralised brain functioning. Some studies in marketing have related lateral influences on cognition and emotion in processing of attachment related stimuli.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6450">A '''shadow biosphere''' is a hypothetical [[microbe|microbial]] [[biosphere]] of Earth that uses radically different [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[molecular biology|molecular]] processes than currently known life. Although life on Earth is relatively well-studied, the shadow biosphere may still remain unnoticed because the exploration of the microbial world targets primarily the biochemistry of the macro-organisms. The term was coined by Carol Cleland and Shelley Copley in 2005.&lt;ref name="Cleland and Copley 2005"&gt;Cleland and Copley (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The hypothesis==
It has been proposed that the early Earth hosted multiple origins of life, some of which produced chemical variations on life as we know it.&lt;ref&gt;Cleland, C.E. (2007) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18053938 Epistemological issues in the study of microbial life: alternative biospheres]. Studies in the History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences 38:847–861.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/apr/14/shadow-biosphere-alien-life-on-earth "Life on Earth… but not as we know it"], Robin McKie, 14 April 2013, The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; Steven A. Benner, Alonso Ricardo, and Matthew A. Carrigan, biochemists at the [[University of Florida]], argued that if [[RNA world hypothesis|organisms based on RNA]] once existed, they might still be alive today, unnoticed because they do not contain [[ribosome]]s, which are usually used to detect living microorganisms. They suggest searching for them in environments that are low in [[sulfur]], environments that are spatially constrained (for example, minerals with pores smaller than one [[micrometre]]), or environments that cycle between extreme hot and cold.&lt;ref&gt;Benner, S. A., Ricardo, A. and Carrigan, M. A. (2004) [http://www.ffame.org/sbenner/cochembiol8.672-689.pdf Is there a common chemical model for life in the universe?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214063212/http://www.ffame.org/sbenner/cochembiol8.672-689.pdf |date=2010-12-14 }}. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., 8, 672-689.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other proposed candidates for a shadow biosphere include organisms using different suites of amino acids in their proteins or different molecular units (e.g., bases or sugars) in their nucleic acids,&lt;ref name="Cleland and Copley 2005"/&gt; having a [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] opposite of ours, using some of the [[Amino acid#Non-standard amino acids|non-standard amino acids]], or using [[arsenic]] instead of [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, P. C. W. , Benner, S.A., Cleland, C.E., Lineweaver,C.H., McKay,C.P. and Wolfe-Simon,F. [http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/ast.2008.0251 Signatures of a Shadow Biosphere] (2009) Astrobiology. 9(2): 241-249. {{doi|10.1089/ast.2008.0251}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carol Cleland, a philosopher of science at the University of Colorado (Boulder), argues that [[desert varnish]], whose status as living or nonliving has been debated since the time of Darwin, should be investigated as a potential candidate for a shadow biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Cleland (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/apr/14/shadow-biosphere-alien-life-on-earth "Life on Earth… but not as we know it"], Robin McKie, 14 April 2013, The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The idea of a shadow biosphere is not widely accepted in biochemistry, and methods used by proponents and conclusions drawn from experiments that purport to show evidence of shadow biospheres have been criticized. For example, evidence that once seemed to support arsenic as a substitute for phosphorus in DNA could have resulted from lab or field contamination, and DNA that includes arsenic is chemically unstable.&lt;ref name=vastag&gt;{{cite news|last=Vastag|first=Brian|title=Debate over arsenic-based life enters a new chapter|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/debate-over-arsenic-based-life-enters-a-new-chapter/2011/05/26/AGhk7fCH_story.html?hpid=z9|newspaper=Washington Post|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6839">'''''Sheilaism''''' is a shorthand term for an individual's system of religious belief which co-opts strands of multiple religions chosen by the individual usually without much theological consideration. The term derives from a woman named Sheila Larson, who is quoted by [[Robert N. Bellah]] et al. in their book ''Habits of the Heart'' as following her own "little voice" in a faith she calls "Sheilaism".{{sfn|Bellah|Madsen|Sullivan|Swidler|1985|p=221}}

==History==
In chapter 9 of their 1985 book ''Habits of the Heart'', [[Robert N. Bellah]], Richard Madsen, William M. Sullivan, [[Ann Swidler]], and Steven M. Tipton discuss how religion in America has moved from being highly public and unified, as it was in [[colonial New England]], to extremely private and diverse. To demonstrate the shift, they quote a young nurse, to whom they gave the name Sheila Larson:
{{quote|I believe in God. I'm not a religious fanatic. I can't remember the last time I went to church. My faith has carried me a long way. It's Sheilaism. Just my own little voice&amp;nbsp;... It's just try to love yourself and be gentle with yourself. You know, I guess, take care of each other. I think He would want us to take care of each other.}}

Bellah et al. suggest that Sheilaism creates the logical possibility "of over 220 million American religions, one for each of us," and they see Sheilaism as "a perfectly natural expression of current American religious life".{{sfn|Bellah|Madsen|Sullivan|Swidler|1985|p=221}} Oddrun M.&amp;nbsp;H. Bråten wrote:
{{quote|Radically individualistic religion like "Sheilaism" may seem very different from, for example, fundamentalist religion, which is also characteristic of our time, but they both emphasise personal religious experience (spirituality). "Sheilaism" is rooted in an attempt to transform external authority to internal meaning. Some may prefer to choose a religion of external authority (Bellah 1985: 235) for this purpose. That religion in principle is a choice, is a result of the religious freedom gained in the western world through [[secularization]]: a central trait of western modernity ([[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Taylor]] 2004: 185, Taylor 2007, see also chapter 2).{{sfn|Bråten|2013|p=171}}}}

The coinage quickly became a touchstone for [[sociology of religion|sociologists of religion]] who repeatedly reference it.{{sfn|Wood|2009|p=241}} One sociologist summed it up as "spiritual [[bricolage]]".{{sfn|Wilcox|2002|p=498}} Sheilaism even has worked its way into more mainstream culture.

The columnist Don Kahle concluded that Sheila "has a code of ethics, but it's no longer connected to a sacred text or an observing deity. It's personal&amp;nbsp;– and unpublished. Sheila abides by Sheilaism. Sheilaism is good for Sheila, but it doesn't build community. Nobody but Sheila knows what are the codes of Sheilaism. Often Sheila doesn't know herself until something 'doesn't feel right'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kahle |first=Don |date=26 October 2007 |title=Will Downtown Progress Be Thwarted? Blame Sheila |url=http://www.dksez.com/if-downtown-plan-gets-thwarted-blame-sheila/ |newspaper=The Register-Guard |location=Eugene, Oregon |page=A13 |issn=0739-8557 |access-date=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Bellah et al. saw Sheilaism as a form of self-absorption that caused a disaffiliation with communities. Their perspective was very much in line with the prevailing view of sociologists since the 1960s who saw such highly individualized religious experience as proof of a larger decline in the importance of religion in the United States as a whole.{{sfn|Wilcox|2002|p=498}} In later comments, Bellah summed up the problem with Sheilaism: "she has made the inner trip and hasn't come back out again, so to speak."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bellah |first=Robert |year=1986 |title=Habits of the Heart: Implications for Religion |url=http://www.robertbellah.com/lectures_5.htm |type=lecture |location=Hartford, Connecticut |publisher=Hartford Seminary |access-date=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural critic [[Hal Niedzviecki]] juxtaposes Sheilaism with Judyism, the joke religion created by comedian [[Judy Tenuta]]. Whereas Tenuta is poking fun at the idea of an individualist religion, even titling a book ''The Power of Judyism'', Niedzviecki laments the fact that Sheilaists take the idea seriously. "Sheilaism permeates our individualistic conformity and continues to demand that our institutions dramatically change to accept us as we want to be."{{sfn|Niedzviecki|2006|p=49}}

Recent scholarship has re-evaluated Sheilaism, noting that even those who claim a particular organized denomination and regularly attend church often have highly individualized perceptions of their faith.{{sfn|Wilcox|2002|p=500}}

[[File:Joris-Karl Huysmans.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Joris-Karl Huysmans]]

'''Spiritual naturalism''', or '''naturalistic spirituality''' combines mundane and spiritual ways of looking at the world.&lt;ref&gt;''The Catholic Periodical and Literature Index'' - Catholic Library Association, 1956, page 357.&lt;/ref&gt; Spiritual naturalism may have first been proposed by [[Joris-Karl Huysmans]] in 1895 in his book ''En Route'' – "In 'En Route' Huysmans started upon the creation of what he called 'Spiritual Naturalism,' that is, realism applied to the story of a soul. ...".&lt;ref&gt;''The Yale Review'' - Yale University, Blackwell, 1915, page 288.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Coming into prominence as a writer during the 1870s, Huysmans quickly established himself among a rising group of writers, the so-called [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist school]], of whom [[Émile Zola]] was the acknowledged head...With Là-bas (1891), a novel which reflected the aesthetics of the spiritualist revival and the contemporary interest in the occult, Huysmans formulated for the first time an aesthetic theory which sought to synthesize the mundane and the transcendent: "spiritual Naturalism". &lt;/blockquote&gt;Long before the term spiritual naturalism was coined by Huysmans, there is evidence of the value system of spiritual naturalism in the [[Stoicism|Stoics]]. "Virtue consists in a will that is in agreement with Nature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Western Philosophy|last = Russell|first = Bertrand|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 254}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
=== Spirituality ===
[[Spirituality]] (from the [[Latin]] root ''spiritus'' 'breath, spirit', from ''spirare'' 'breathe'&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary''. 3rd ed. Edited by Angus Stevenson and Christine A. Lindberg. New York: Oxford University Press, 2015. DOI: 10.1093/acref/9780195392883.001.0001&lt;/ref&gt;) is an overarching concept related to [[religion]] and "affecting the human spirit or soul as opposed to material or physical things".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;"Definition of Naturalism in English." ''Oxford Dictionary (American English) (US)''. Oxford University Press, n.d. Web. 10 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; With many different definitions as scholars try to pin down exactly what it is they are defining, it has tended to have a more positive connotation than religion broadly in recent years because of its "association with personal experiences of the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]]".&lt;ref&gt;Spilka, Β. and D. N. Mcintosh. 1996. August. ''Religion and spirituality: The known and the unknown.'' Paper presented at the American Psychological Association annual conference, Toronto, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zinnbauer, Brian J. et al.. "Religion and Spirituality: Unfuzzying the Fuzzy". ''Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion'' 36.4 (1997): 549–564. Web. doi:10.2307/1387689.&lt;/ref&gt; It is seen as more positive because of trends toward privileging individuality, and so many different definitions are given it by many different people, any one of them unlikely to satisfy everyone.

In fact, the term is so broad and so dependent on who is using how, why, when, and in what context, that some have given up on trying to give it a comprehensive definition and just say that it means something different to all who use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Psychology Today|url = https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/spirituality|website = www.psychologytoday.com|accessdate = 2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps a less necessarily contextual definition is found in the words of K. I. Pargament, who sees spirituality as a "search for the sacred" of each individual.&lt;ref&gt;Pargament, K. I., &amp; Mahoney, A. (2002). Spirituality. In C. R. Snyder &amp; S. J. Lopez (Eds.) ''Handbook of Positive Psychology'' (pp. 646-656) New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Naturalism ===
[[Metaphysical naturalism|Naturalism]] (from Latin ''natura'' 'birth, nature, quality'&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;) is "the idea or belief that only natural (as opposed to supernatural or spiritual) laws and forces operate in the world".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; It has been especially prominent in America,&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Jon. "Naturalism." ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', n.d. Web. 6 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a valuable tool in scientific endeavors to discover the natural laws of the universe as it believes that everything can be explained through the language and explanatory power of empirical scientific experimentation. It is not, however, necessarily a lack of religion; given a definition of religion that includes searching for the truths of the universe, naturalism is eminently describable as such. Scholar Jerome A. Stone gives the definition as "affirm[ing] that attention should be focused on the events and processes of this world to provide what degree of explanation and meaning are possible to this life".&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Jerome Arthur. "Spirituality For Naturalists." ''Zygon'' 47.3 (2012): 481-500. ''ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials.'' Web. 3 Dec. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The spiritual variety of naturalism finds ways to reconcile the feelings of awe and religious experience with the idea that everything is natural and can be studied using methods applicable to studying nature, including the place of humans in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Kurtz, Paul, 1990. ''Philosophical Essays in Pragmatic Naturalism,'' Prometheus Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Spiritual Naturalism is a variety of philosophical and religious worldviews that are naturalistic in their basic viewpoint but have a spiritual and religious perspective also. Chief among modern forms of Spiritual Naturalism are [[religious naturalism]], [[religious humanism]], [[dualist pantheism]], and humanistic religious naturalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uuworld.org/ideas/articles/6558.shtml uuworld (org)].&lt;/ref&gt; The term may also apply to the beliefs of some [[Paganism|(naturalistic) pagans]], [[Process Philosophy|process thinkers]], many [[Taoism|Taoists]], a number of [[Hinduism|Hindus]], and a variety of non-affiliated independent thinkers who base their spiritual experience directly on Nature itself rather than traditional deities and the [[supernatural]] (i.e. [[Epicureans]]). Some [[Society for Humanistic Judaism|liberal Jewish congregations]], [[nontheist Friend]]s, and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uurn.org/ uurn (org)].&lt;/ref&gt; have similar orientations in their adoption of Religious Naturalism beliefs.

Although the overall movement toward these attitudes remains relatively small and loosely organized, various forms of Spiritual Naturalism have existed since time immemorial, with the pantheistic philosophies of Taoism and similar Eastern nature-mysticisms being perhaps the most notable example. At present, there is a growing interest in adopting a Spiritual Naturalism rational alternative for the modern world because many are losing their belief in more traditional spiritual avenues. This is demonstrated in the recent rapid growth of Religious Naturalism, [[Naturalistic pantheism|pantheism]] (particularly of an avowedly naturalistic variety) and some [[liberal Christian]] perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcpc.org/library/article.cfm?library_id=562 Imagining a Progressive Revolution].&lt;/ref&gt; Theologians such as [[John Shelby Spong]] and [[Paul Tillich]] have embraced thinking that is non-secular naturalist.

Crucial challenges for the spiritual naturalism movement in its various forms currently involve developing and promulgating a conciliate understanding of the somewhat ambiguous terms ''spirituality'' and ''naturalism''. The difference in interpreting the difference between religious and spiritual, [[humanism|humanist]] and [[metaphysical naturalism|naturalist]] and free will and determinism also needs a consensus. In addition the individualistic nature and thinking of many of the adherents preclude organizing cohesive communities. However recent authors ([[Ursula Goodenough]], [[Chet Raymo]], [[Karl E. Peters]], [[Loyal Rue]] and [[Stuart Kauffman]]) are highlighting the paradigm via their naturalistic writings.

In addition a few modern theologians with liberal orientations have rejected some of the historical claims of some biblical doctrines and supernaturalism and moved to progressive forms of [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] akin to [[Theism|theistic]] naturalism. Examples are: [[Mordecai Kaplan]], [[John Shelby Spong]], [[Paul Tillich]], [[John A. T. Robinson]], William Murry and Gordon Kaufman. Some of those into [[process theology]] may also be included in this movement.

==Orientation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}
Spiritual Naturalism has advocates that cover the religious spectrum including neo-theism ([[neo-Christianity]], process theology), [[Nontheism|non-theism]], and not-theism, though the advocates are by no means limited to these orientations. The majority probably are [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] or [[Atheism|atheistic]] while many prefer not to be categorized.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Spiritual Naturalism? {{!}} The Spiritual Naturalist Society|url = http://spiritualnaturalistsociety.org/about-us/what-is-spiritual-naturalism/|website = spiritualnaturalistsociety.org|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a vast difference in opinions on how to address the question of a deity of some kind, if at all. There are those who see God as the creative process within/of the universe, those who define [[Pantheism|God as the totality of the universe]] ([[The All]]), some who use God in metaphoric ways, those who have no need to use the concept or terminology of God even as a metaphor, and some who are atheistic proclaiming there is no such entity whatsoever and rebel against usage of the term.

Spiritual Naturalism is chiefly concerned with finding ways to access traditional spiritual feelings without the inclusion of supernatural elements incompatible with [[science]] and a broad [[Humanistic naturalism|naturalism]]. Adherents believe that [[nature]], in all its diversity and wonder, is sufficient unto itself in terms of eliciting the intellectual and emotional responses associated with spiritual experience, and that there is no need for faith in the traditional [[anthropomorphic]] concept of '[[god]]' or similar ideas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Adherents of Spiritual Naturalism are generally scientifically-oriented in most aspects, with their primary difference from other naturalists being their belief that the abandonment of [[superstition]] does not necessarily entail the abandonment of spirituality. To adherents, the intellectual and emotional experience of something greater than oneself is seen as a phenomenon of enduring value; spirituality may be seen as "an emotional response to Reality".

== Examples in religions ==
=== Judaism ===
Spiritual Naturalist ideas are most prevalent in [[Reconstructionist Judaism]]: a modern Jewish movement based on the ideas of [[Mordecai Kaplan]]. Reconstructionist Jews assert that Judaism, as a culture and as a religion, is constantly evolving and adapting to modernity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Who is a Reconstructionist Jew? {{!}} Jewish Reconstructionist Community|url = http://www.jewishrecon.org/resource/who-reconstructionist-jew|website = www.jewishrecon.org|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[God]] is not perceived as a supernatural being, but as being "manifest in the practice of kindness, justice and righteousness on the earth".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Evolution of the Idea of God in Jewish Religion|last = Kaplan|first = Mordecai|date = 1967|journal = The Jewish Quarterly Review|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reconstructionist conception of God is compatible with the spiritual naturalist's assertion that there is no supernatural; spirituality is manifest in the physical world. Kaplan also states that "the reality of God henceforth will have to be experienced through the functioning of conscience in the conduct of men and nations".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; To Kaplan and Reconstructionist Jews, God is the collective consciousness of the Jewish community, not a supernatural other. One strives to know God, and to know God is to know how to live morally.

=== Christianity ===
Naturalism in [[Christianity]] is a rarer phenomenon than in some other religions because of the intensity of belief in the personhood of God, especially through the figure of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. Some scholars&lt;ref&gt;Braxton, Donald M. "Religious Naturalism And The Future Of Christianity." ''Zygon'' 42.2 (2007): 317-341. ''ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials.'' Web. 29 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; also posit that the anthropomorphizing tendencies of such religion will not be overcome in the near future, partly because the categories of the supernatural are too well suited to our current attitude toward nature: Westernized societies tend to view nature as something to be used, not something to feel religious awe towards.

With the development of scientific thought and the discoveries in evolution, physics, etc. have come challenges to the Christian worldview. Over time, various ideas on how to reconcile these scientific truths with theological truths of the doctrines of Christianity. There is the once-popular [[clockwork universe]] theory, which states that God made the universe to run its course mechanically predetermined; however, this has lost popularity after more discoveries about the probabilistic nature of the universe. There is also the idea that God interferes supernaturally in ways that mask the presence of the supernatural—perhaps at the quantum level where scientists cannot precisely determine anything. This tends toward making a joke of everything scientists strive for.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Brun, Rudolf B. "Strict Naturalism And Christianity: Attempt At Drafting An Updated Theology Of Nature." ''Zygon'' 42.3 (2007): 701-713. ''ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials.'' Web. 29 Nov. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interpretation, one where both truths may be simultaneous and coterminous comes from the [[New Testament]] quote "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God... Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made."&lt;ref&gt;''John. The Holy Bible, New International Version: Containing the Old Testament and the New Testament''. Grand Rapids: Zondervan Bible, 1978. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be interpreted as saying that the Word of God is not God, but the perfect expression of God that is God and is not God but brings forth creation. In the words of Rudolf Brun "The Christian revelation about creation does not proclaim that creation is an extension or a function embedded in God. Rather, the Word of God that is and remains God is given away to creation. It is a gift that empowers creation to become itself." This allows God to be all things ([[pantheism]]) and in all things ([[panentheism]]) without either of those cases being true. It allows Christian belief in God to be worked into a worldview where there is no predetermined path for the cosmos, because God so loved the world that the Word was given freely to become nature in all its creativity and freedom.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Taoism ===
"The term [[Tao]] means "way", "path", or "principle", and can also be found in Chinese philosophies and religions other than [[Taoism]]. In Taoism, however, Tao denotes something that is both the source of, and the force behind, everything that exists. Taoist propriety and ethics may vary depending on the particular school, but in general they tend to emphasize [[Wu wei|Wu-wei]] (action through non-action), "naturalness", simplicity, spontaneity, and the Three Treasures: compassion, moderation, and humility."&lt;ref name="spiritualnaturalistsociety.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spiritualnaturalistsociety.org/about-us/what-is-spiritual-naturalism/|title=The Spiritual Naturalist Society|author=|date=|website=The Spiritual Naturalist Society|accessdate=15 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Though Tao is ultimately transcendent, it is also immanent. In this secondary sense it is the way of the universe, the norm, the rhythm, the driving power in all nature, the ordering principle behind all life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The World's Religions: Our Great Wisdom Traditions|last = Smith|first = Huston|publisher = San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco|year = 1991|isbn = |location = |pages = 97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Tao can be talked about, but not the Eternal Tao. 
Names can be named, but not the Eternal Name.
As the origin of heaven-and-earth, it is nameless:
As the "Mother" of all Things it is nameable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Tao Te Ching|last = Laozi|first = and D.C Lau|publisher = Chinese University Press|year = 1982|isbn = |location = Hong Kong|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Buddhism ===
"In a way, Spiritual Naturalism could be looked at as a form of [[Buddhist philosophy|philosophical Buddhism]]. There are many [[Schools of Buddhism|schools and ways of conceiving of Buddhism and practicing it]]. Many of Buddhism's concepts can be interpreted in naturalistic terms. Buddhism has certainly inspired the Spiritual Naturalist practices of [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]], [[mindfulness]], [[Ahimsa|compassion]], and more. Therefore, there is much overlap and many people are both Buddhists and Spiritual Naturalists".&lt;ref name="spiritualnaturalistsociety.org"/&gt; The [[Noble Eightfold Path]] and the [[Five Precepts]] of [[Buddhism]] are rooted in right relationship between the devotee, morality, and practices that align with naturalism.

'''Stenohaline''' describes an organism, usually [[fish]], that cannot tolerate a wide fluctuation in the [[salinity]] of [[water]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca.uky.edu/wkrec/VertebrateFishEvolution.htm Wurts, W. Why can some fish live in freshwater, some in salt water, and some in both? World Aquaculture 29(1):p.65.]&lt;/ref&gt; Stenohaline is derived from the words: "''steno''" meaning narrow, and "''haline''" meaning salt.  Many [[fresh water]] fish, such as [[goldfish]] (''Carassius auratus''), tend to be stenohaline and die in environments of high [[salinity]] such as the [[ocean]]. Many marine fish, such as [[Melanogrammus aeglefinus|haddock]], are also stenohaline and die in water with lower salinity.  

Alternatively, fish living in coastal [[estuaries]] and [[tide pools]] are often [[euryhaline]] (tolerant to changes in salinity) as are many species which have [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] requiring tolerance to both fresh water and [[seawater]] environments such as [[salmon]] and [[herring]].

The term '''suspension of disbelief''' or '''willing suspension of disbelief''' has been defined as a willingness to suspend one's critical faculties and believe something surreal; sacrifice of realism and logic for the sake of enjoyment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite dictionary|author=&lt;!--None listed.--&gt;|date=2018|dictionary=[[Oxford Dictionaries]]|title=suspend disbelief (phrase)|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/suspend_disbelief|access-date=29 July 2018|edition=Online|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=|oclc=656668849|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729045913/https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/suspend_disbelief|archive-date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined in 1817 by the poet and aesthetic philosopher [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], who suggested that if a writer could infuse a "human interest and a semblance of truth" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgement concerning the implausibility of the narrative. Suspension of disbelief often applies to fictional works of the action, comedy, fantasy, and horror genres. '''Cognitive estrangement''' in fiction involves using a person's ignorance to promote suspension of disbelief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Critical Theory|last=Buchanan|first=Ian|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780199532919|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "suspension of disbelief" came to be used more loosely in the later 20th century, often used to imply that the burden was on the reader, rather than the writer, to achieve it. This might be used to refer to the willingness of the audience to overlook the limitations of a medium, so that these do not interfere with the acceptance of those premises. These premises may also lend to the engagement of the mind and perhaps proposition of thoughts, ideas, art and theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= From 'King Kong' to 'Indecent Proposal,' audiences have been asked to buy a premise that can make – or break – a film|work= The Los Angeles Times|date=15 April 1993|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1993-04-15/entertainment/ca-23034_1_indecent-proposal|accessdate=2010-10-24|first=Robert W.|last=Welkos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspension of disbelief is often an essential element for a magic act or a circus sideshow act. For example, an audience is not expected to actually believe that a woman is [[Sawing a woman in half|cut in half]] or transforms into a gorilla&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Botos|first=Tim|title=‘Gorilla Girl' sideshow act hangs on despite changing times|url=http://www.patriotledger.com/archive/x144223716/-Gorilla-Girl-sideshow-act-hangs-on-despite-changing-times|accessdate=15 October 2012|newspaper=GateHouse News Service; Patriot Ledger|date=21 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to enjoy the performance.

According to the theory, suspension of disbelief is an essential ingredient for any kind of storytelling. With any film, the viewer has to ignore the reality that they are viewing a staged performance and temporarily accept it as their reality in order to be entertained. [[Black-and-white]] films provide an obvious early example that audiences are willing to suspend disbelief, no matter how implausible the images appear, for the sake of entertainment. With the exception of totally color blind people ([[Achromatopsia|achromats]]), no person viewing these films sees the real world without color, but some are still willing to suspend disbelief and accept the images in order to be entertained. Suspension of disbelief is also supposed to be essential for the enjoyment of many films and television shows involving complex stunts, special effects, and seemingly unrealistic plots and characterizations.

== Coleridge's original formulation ==
Coleridge coined the phrase in his ''[[Biographia Literaria]]'', published in 1817, in the context of the creation and reading of poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Safire, William.  ''On Language; Suspension of Disbelief''. New York Times. 7 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Chapter XIV describes the preparations with [[Wordsworth]] for their revolutionary collaboration ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' (first edition 1798), for which Coleridge had contributed the more romantic, gothic pieces including ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''. Poetry and fiction involving the supernatural had gone out of fashion to a large extent in the 18th century, in part due to the declining belief in witches and other supernatural agents among the educated classes, who embraced the rational approach to the world offered by the new science. [[Alexander Pope]], notably, felt the need to explain and justify his use of elemental spirits in ''[[The Rape of the Lock]]'', one of the few English poems of the century that invoked the supernatural. Coleridge wished to revive the use of fantastic elements in poetry. The concept of "willing suspension of disbelief" explained how a modern, enlightened audience might continue to enjoy such types of story.

Coleridge recalled:

{{quote|... It was agreed, that my endeavours should be directed to persons and characters supernatural, or at least romantic, yet so as to transfer from our inward nature a human interest and a semblance of truth sufficient to procure for these shadows of imagination that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment, which constitutes poetic faith. Mr. Wordsworth on the other hand was to propose to himself as his object, to give the charm of novelty to things of every day, and to excite a feeling analogous to the supernatural, by awakening the mind's attention from the lethargy of custom, and directing it to the loveliness and the wonders of the world before us ...&lt;ref&gt;Coleridge, Biographia Literaria, 1817, Chapter XIV&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The notion of such an action by an audience was however recognized in antiquity, as seen particularly in the Roman theoretical concerns of Horace, who also lived in an age of increasing skepticism about the supernatural, in his ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' (with the quotation ''[[Ut pictura poesis]]'').

== Examples in literature ==
{{See also|Dramatic convention}}
Suspension of disbelief is sometimes said to be an essential component of live theater, where it was recognized by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], who refers to it in the Prologue to ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'':

{{quote|[…] make imaginary puissance […] 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings […] turning the accomplishment of many years into an hourglass.}}

== Psychology ==
Psychological critic Norman Holland points to a neuroscientific explanation.  When we hear or watch any narrative, our brains go wholly into perceiving mode, turning off the systems for acting or planning to act, and with them go our systems for assessing reality. We have, in Coleridge's second, more accurate phrase, "poetic faith". That's why humans have such trouble recognizing lies: they first believe, then have to make a conscious effort to disbelieve.

Only when we stop perceiving to think about what we have seen or heard, only then do we assess its truth-value. If we are really "into" the fiction – "transported", in the psychologists' term – we are, as Immanuel Kant pointed out long ago, "disinterested". We respond aesthetically, without purpose.  We don't judge the truth of what we're perceiving, even though if we stop being transported and think about it, we know quite well it's a fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holland|first1=Norman|title=Spiderman? Sure! The Neuroscience of Disbelief|journal=Interdisciplinary Science Reviews|date=2008|volume=33|issue=4|pages=312–320|url=https://www.researchgate.net/researcher/2003369909_Norman_Holland|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Holland|first1=Norman|title=Literature and the Brain|url=http://www.literatureandthebrain.com|website=Literatureandthebrain.com|publisher=PsyArt|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suspension of disbelief has also been used within a mental health context by Frank DeFulgentis in his book ''Flux''. It is an attempt to describe the phenomenon of forgetting irrational thoughts associated with cases of [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|OCD]]. In the book, the author suggests 'suspending disbelief' as opposed to forcing ourselves to forget; similar to how one would put a virus in quarantine. We can thereby allow ourselves to be absorbed in the activities around us until these irrationalities vanish on their own accord.

== Criticisms ==

[[Aesthetics|Aesthetic philosophers]] generally reject claims that suspension of disbelief accurately characterizes the relationship between people and "fictions." [[Kendall Walton]] notes that, if viewers were to truly suspend disbelief at a horror movie and accept its images as absolute fact, they would have a true-to-life set of reactions. For instance, audience members would cry out, "Look behind you!" to an endangered on-screen character or call the police when they witnessed an on-screen murder.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2025831 Fearing Fictions]", Kendall L. Walton, [[JSTOR]] (''[[Journal of Philosophy|The Journal of Philosophy]]'', Vol. 75, No. 1 (01-1978), pp. 5–27). Retrieved 3 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many of these criticisms simply fail to notice that Coleridge's original statement came in a restrictive clause. The formulation "...that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment which constitutes poetic faith," of necessity implies that there are different sorts of suspension of disbelief and specifies that poetic faith is one instance of a larger class. One need not choose to believe that a character in a horror film is a real person in order, for example, to choose to believe that the character is looking at the building seen in the following reverse-shot.{{or|date=August 2018}}

Not all authors believe that suspension of the disbelief adequately characterizes the audience's relationship to imaginative works of art. [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] challenges this concept in his essay "[[On Fairy-Stories]]", choosing instead the paradigm of secondary belief based on inner [[consistency]] of reality. Tolkien says that, in order for the narrative to work, the reader must believe that what he reads is true within the secondary reality of the fictional world. By focusing on creating an [[Fictional universe#Definition|internally consistent fictional world]], the author makes secondary belief possible. Tolkien argues that suspension of disbelief is only necessary when the work has failed to create secondary belief. From that point the spell is broken, and the reader ceases to be immersed in the story and must make a conscious effort to suspend disbelief or else give up on it entirely.&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, J. R. R. “On Fairy-Stories.” The Monsters and the Critics and Other Essays, George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1983, pp. 109–61.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3771">'''Theory of functional systems''' - is a model that describes the structure of [[Behavior|conduct]], which was established by Russian and Soviet biologist and physiologist [[Pyotr Anokhin]].
Functional systems were put forward by Anokhin as an alternative to the predominant concept of [[reflexes]]. Contrary to reflexes, the endpoints of functional systems are not actions themselves but ''adaptive results of these actions''. In contrast to reflexes, which are based on ''linear spread of information'' from receptors to executive organs through the central nervous system, functional systems are [[self-organizing]] [[non-linear]] systems composed of synchronized distributed elements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.keldysh.ru/pages/mrbur-web/publ/IJCNN04.pdf V.G.Red’ko, D.V.Prokhorov, M.B.Burtsev], ''Theory of Functional Systems, Adaptive Critics and Neural Networks'', in Proceedings of International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, Budapest, 2004, pp.1787-1792&lt;/ref&gt;

"The principle of functional systems" - association of private mechanisms of the body in a [[holistic]] system of adaptive behavioral act, the establishment of "integrative unity". 

There are two types of functional systems: 
* System of the first type provide [[homeostasis]] due to internal (existing) resources of the body, inside its boundaries (e.g. blood pressure). 
* System of a second type supports homeostasis due to a change of behavior, interaction with the outside world and are the basis of different types of behavior.

== Stages of the behavioral act ==
[[File:Theory of Functional Systems (m) .png|680px|right]]
*[[Afferent synthesis]]
*:Any excitement in the central nervous system there is in interaction with other excitations: the brain analyzes these excitations. Synthesis determines the following factors: 
**[[Motivation]] 
**Pad afferentation (excitation caused by conditioned and unconditioned stimuli) 
**Situational afferentation (arousal from familiar surroundings, causing a reflex, and dynamic stereotypes) 
**[[Memory]] (of species and individual) 
*Decision-making 
** The formation of action result acceptor (creating the ideal image and its retention goals, presumably, at the physiological level is circulating in the ring interneuron excitation) 
**[[Efferent synthesis]] (or the stage of the program, integration of somatic and autonomic excitations in a single behavioral act. The action is formed, but is not manifested externally) 
*[[Action theory (philosophy)|Action]] (program execution behavior) 
*Evaluation result of the action 
*:At this stage, comparison of the actual running of the ideal image created during the formation of acceptor result of the action (the reverse occurs afferentation) based on a comparison of the action, or adjusted, or terminated. 
*Meeting the needs (authorizing termination of stage) 

Choice of targets and methods of achieving them are the key factors that regulate behavior. According to Anokhin, in the structure of the behavioral act afferent feedback compared with the acceptor of the result gives a positive or negative ''situational'' [[emotions]] affect the correction or termination of action (another type of emotion, ''leading'' emotions, are associated with satisfaction or dissatisfaction needs in general, with the formation of the target). In addition, the behavior affect the memories of positive and negative emotions. 

In general, behavioral act is characterized by meaningful and active role of the subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2527">In [[telecommunication]]s, '''''transparency''''' can refer to: 
#The property of an entity that allows another entity to pass through it without altering either of the entities. 
#The property that allows a [[transmission system]] or [[channel (communications)|channel]] to accept, at its input, unmodified [[user information]], and deliver corresponding user information at its [[Output (computing)|output]], unchanged in form or information content. The user information may be changed internally within the transmission system, but it is restored to its original form prior to the output without the involvement of the user.
#The quality of a [[data]] [[communications system]] or device that uses a [[bit]]-oriented [[link protocol]] that does not depend on the bit [[sequence]] structure used by the data source.&lt;ref&gt;{{FS1037C MS188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{DODDIC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some communication systems are not transparent.
Non-transparent communication systems have one or both of the following problems:
* user data may be incorrectly interpreted as internal commands. For example, modems with a [[Time Independent Escape Sequence]] or 20th century [[Signaling System No. 5]] and [[R2 signalling]] telephone systems, which occasionally incorrectly interpreted user data (from a "[[blue box (phreaking)|blue box]]") as commands.
* output "user data" may not always be the same as input user data. For example, many early [[email]] systems were not [[8-bit clean]]; they seemed to transfer typical short text messages properly, but converted "unusual" characters (the [[control character]]s, the "[[high ASCII]]" characters) in an irreversible way into some other "usual" character. Many of these systems also changed user data in other irreversible ways &amp;ndash; such as inserting [[linefeed]]s to make sure each line is less than some maximum length, and inserting a "&gt;" at the beginning of every line that begins with "From ".&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.jwz.org/doc/content-length.html "Configuring Netscape Mail On Unix: Why the Content-Length Format is Bad"]
by Jamie Zawinski 1997
&lt;/ref&gt; Until [[8BITMIME]], a variety of [[binary-to-text encoding]] techniques have been overlaid on top of such systems to restore transparency &amp;ndash; to make sure that any possible file can be transferred so that the final output "user data" is actually identical to the original user data.

[[File:Murano glassmaker.jpg|thumb|200px|Glassmaker in Murano.]]
'''Venetian glass''' is a type of [[glass]] object made in [[Venice]], [[Italy]], primarily on the island of [[Murano]].  It is world-renowned for being colorful, elaborate, and skillfully made.

Many of the important characteristics of these objects had been developed by the thirteenth century. Toward the end of that century, the centre of the Venetian glass industry moved to [[Murano]].

[[Byzantine glass|Byzantine]] craftsmen played an important role in the development of Venetian glass,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.about-venice-travel-guide.com/arts-and-crafts-in-venice.html "Arts and Crafts in Venice"] About Venice Travel Guide&lt;/ref&gt; an art form for which the city is well known.  When [[Constantinople]] was sacked by the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204, some fleeing artisans came to Venice{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}. This happened again when the [[Ottomans]] took Constantinople in 1453, supplying Venice with still more glassworkers{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}. By the sixteenth century, Venetian artisans had gained even greater control over the colour and transparency of their glass, and had mastered a variety of decorative techniques.

Despite efforts to keep Venetian glassmaking techniques within Venice, they became known elsewhere, and Venetian-style glassware was produced in other Italian cities and other countries of Europe.

Some of the most important brands of glass in the world today, including Venini,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venini.com/eng/storia.htm] History of Venini&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barovier &amp; Toso]], [[Pauly &amp; C. - Compagnia Venezia Murano|Pauly]] and [[Seguso]],&lt;ref&gt;Carl I. Gable,
''Murano Magic: Complete Guide to Venetian Glass, its History and Artists'' (Schiffer, 2004). {{ISBN|0-7643-1946-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; are still produced in the historical glass factories on Murano. Barovier &amp; Toso is considered to be one of the 100 [[List of oldest companies|oldest companies]] in continuous operation in the world, having been founded in 1295.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barovier.com/s_company/chi_storia.asp] Barovier&amp;Toso - A Time-Honoured Heritage&lt;/ref&gt;

Murano’s reputation as a centre for glassmaking was born when the [[Venetian Republic]], fearing fire and destruction to the city’s mostly wood buildings, ordered the destruction of all the foundries within the city in 1291.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crouzet-Pavan |first=Elisabeth |translator=Lydia G. Cochrane |title=Venice Triumphant |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |year=2002 |isbn=0-8018-8189-7 |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Republic ordered the destruction of the foundries, it authorised and encouraged construction outside the city, and by the late 13th century, the glassmaking industry was centred in Murano. Murano glass is still interwoven with Venetian glass.

Murano's glassmakers were soon the island’s most prominent citizens. By the 14th century, glassmakers were allowed to wear swords, enjoyed immunity from prosecution by the Venetian state and found their daughters married into Venice’s most affluent families. Of course there was a catch: Glassmakers were not allowed to leave the Republic. Many craftsmen took this risk, however, and set up glass furnaces in surrounding cities and as far afield as England and the Netherlands.

Murano’s glassmakers held a monopoly on quality glassmaking for centuries, developing or refining many technologies including crystalline [[glass]], [[enameled glass]] (''smalto''), glass with threads of gold (''aventurine''), multicoloured glass (''[[millefiori]]''), [[milk glass]] (''lattimo''), and imitation gemstones made of glass.  Today, the artisans of Murano are still employing these centuries-old techniques, crafting everything from contemporary art glass and glass jewelry to Murano glass chandeliers and wine stoppers.

Today, Murano is home to the ''[[Museo Vetrario]]'' or Glass Museum in the Palazzo Giustinian, which holds displays on the history of glassmaking, as well as glass samples ranging from Egyptian times through the present day.

==The art of glassmaking==
The process of making Murano glass is rather complex. The glass is made from [[silica]], which becomes liquid at high temperatures.  As the glass passes from a [[liquid]] to a [[solid]] state, there is an interval when the glass is soft before it hardens completely.  This is when the glass-master can shape the material.

[[File:Muranobeads.jpg|thumb|Orange Murano beads]]

===Materials===
The other raw materials, called [[ceramic flux]]es or melting agents, allow the glass to soften at lower temperatures.  The more [[sodium oxide]] present in the glass, the slower it solidifies.  This is important for hand-working because it allows the glassmaker more time to shape the material.  The various raw materials an artisan might add to a glass mixture are [[sodium]] (to reduce melting temperature), [[nitrate]] and [[arsenic]] (to eliminate bubbles) and colouring or opacifying substances.

===Colours, techniques and materials===
[[File:Venetian Goblet QM r.jpg|thumb|Venetian artisans use special tools including: borselle (tongs to hand-form the red-hot glass); canna da soffio (a blowing pipe); pontello (an iron rod that helps with adding the finishing touches); scagno (a work bench); and tagianti (glass-cutting clippers)]]

Colours, techniques and materials vary depending upon the look a glassmaker is trying to achieve.  Aquamarine is created through the use of copper and cobalt compounds, whereas ruby red uses a gold solution as a colouring agent. [[Murrine]] technique begins with the layering of coloured liquid glass, which is then stretched into long rods called canes ([[caneworking]]) different color canes are then arranged in a mold to form a design. Then they are heated to fusing temperatures and when fused then pulled (stretched) again like taffy to reduce diameters. Then when cold, these canes are then sliced in cross-section, which show a layered pattern.  The better-known term ''millefiori'' is a way of using lots of sliced murrine that being picked up from the marver by a  gather of hot molten glass. When the amalgam of this type of murrine shows the likeness of many flowers, thus mille (thousand) fiori (flowers). [[Filigree]] (a type of [[caneworking]]), ''incalmo'', [[vitreous enamel|enamel painted]], [[glass engraving]], gold engraving, ''lattimo'', ribbed glass and submersion are just a few of the other techniques a glassmaker can employ many of which have not changed since Roman times (the Romans promoted their glass industry wherever they went).

===Tools===
Murano artisans use the specialised tools of their trade in the making of their glass.  Some of these tools (which under different names have been used by glassblowers since Roman times) include ''borselle'' (tongs or pliers used to hand-form the red-hot glass), ''canna da soffio'' (blowing pipe), ''pontello'' (an iron rod to which the craftsman attaches the glass after blowing to add final touches), ''scagno'' (the glass-master's work bench) and ''tagianti'' (large glass-cutting clippers).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12926">'''Vilhelm Peter Grønbech''' (14 June 1873 &amp;ndash; 21 April 1948) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] cultural historian. He was professor of the history of religion at the [[University of Copenhagen]] and also had a great influence on Danish intellectual life, especially during and after World War II.

==Life and career==
Grønbech was born in [[Allinge]], on [[Bornholm]]. His family moved to Copenhagen and beginning in 1890 he studied [[philology]] at the University of Copenhagen (Danish with Latin and English as secondary subjects),&lt;ref name=BioLex&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/index.php?title=Dansk_Biografisk_Leksikon/Historie/Religionshistoriker/Vilh._Gr%C3%B8nbech "Vilhelm Grønbech"], ''[[Dansk Biografisk Leksikon]]'', retrieved 10 October 2014 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; while working at the [[Royal Library, Denmark|Royal Library]] and as a schoolteacher. In 1902 he received his doctorate for a study of the historical phonetics of [[Turkish language|Turkish]], after which he began teaching at the university, first as a [[docent]] and then from 1908 to 1911 as a lecturer in English literature, while also working as a church organist. He published a book of poems and a study of the dialect of [[Bukhara]].&lt;ref name=Mitchell11&gt;P. M. Mitchell, ''Vilhelm Grønbech'', Twayne's World Authors Series 397, Boston: Hall-Twayne, 1978, {{ISBN|9780805763065}}, Chronology p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 the first volume of his work on [[Germanic paganism]], ''Vor Folkeætt i Oldtiden'' (English title ''The Culture of the Teutons'') was published, and in 1911 he became a docent in the history of religion. After the appearance of the remaining three volumes of ''Vor Folkeætt i Oldtiden'' in 1912 and of a related essay, "Religionsskiftet i Norden" on the [[christianization of Scandinavia|conversion of Scandinavia]] (1913), the [[University of Leipzig]] sought in 1914 to award him a professorship and in 1915 he was appointed professor of the history of religion at Copenhagen, a position which he held until 1943.&lt;ref name=SD&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Sprog,_religion_og_filosofi/Religion_og_mystik/Religionshistorikere/Vilhelm_Gr%C3%B8nbech "Vilhelm Grønbech"], ''[[Den Store Danske]]'', retrieved 8 October 2014 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mitchell11/&gt; Early in his career he also taught at the state college of education and from 1918 to 1920 headed the Danish Society for Psychic Research.&lt;ref name=BioLex/&gt; 

During the [[German occupation of Denmark]] in World War II, Grønbech's lectures drew large audiences, and after the war he founded the periodical ''[[Frie Ord]]'' with the theologian [[Hal Koch]]. It ran from 1946 to 1948, with Grønbech the primary contributor, and was rapidly successful, with 6,000 subscribers within a few months of its founding.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 129&amp;ndash;30.&lt;/ref&gt; Several of his articles published there were republished in posthumous collections; a 1943 lecture series at [[Borup's College]] in [[Copenhagen]] was published from shorthand transcriptions as ''Lyset fra Akropolis'' (The Light from the Acropolis, 1950).&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 115, 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grønbech was nominated for the [[Nobel prize in literature]] eleven times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=3689 Nomination Database], Nobel Prize, retrieved 24 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the year of his retirement, Allinge awarded him honorary citizenship and the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] awarded him a free residence at Lundehave in [[Helsingør]]; he died in Helsingør in 1948.&lt;ref name=BioLex/&gt;

Grønbech was married twice, in 1900 to Pauline Ramm, who died in 1946, and in August 1947 to [[Honorine Hermelin|Honorine Louise Hermelin]], [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the Swedish [[folk high school]] for women at Fogelstad in Sweden. His son Kaare Grønbech, born in 1901, was a specialist in Asian languages.&lt;ref name=BioLex/&gt; Grønbech ordered his papers destroyed,&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 143.&lt;/ref&gt; but the Royal Library has a large archive.&lt;ref name=BioLex/&gt;&lt;ref name=revival&gt;Brigitte Larsen, [http://www.kristeligt-dagblad.dk/kultur/gr%C3%B8nbech-i-understr%C3%B8mmen "Grønbech i understrømmen"], ''[[Kristeligt Dagblad]]'', 24 April 2002 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications and views==
Although trained as a philologist, Grønbech's focus from his earliest major work, ''Vor Folkeætt i Oldtiden'', was on analysing key terms in order to apprehend the essence of a religion and hence of a culture.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 16&amp;ndash;17, 33.&lt;/ref&gt; He later applied the same method to the study of Greek, medieval, and Indian mystics (''Mystikere i Europa og Indien'', 4 volumes, 1925, 1932, 1934, with the last volume being on 19th-century poets) and two studies of Greece and Hellenistic Rome, ''Hellenismen'' (1940; 2 volumes published, a projected third not completed) and ''Hellas'' (4 volumes, 1942, 1944, 1945). He was unusually capable of immersing himself in the system of thought he wished to depict,&lt;ref name=BioLex/&gt; such that in the words of his English-language biographer he could "write about [it] as if he accepted its theses and principles", and "it is not possible to circumscribe accurately what his own religious&amp;mdash;not to mention political&amp;mdash;convictions must have been."&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=19threview&gt;[[Basil Willey]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3720701 Review of ''Religious Currents in the 19th Century'' by Vilhelm Grønbech; translated by P. M. Mitchell, W. D. Paden], ''[[The Modern Language Review]]'' 60.3 (July 1965) 438&amp;ndash;39.&lt;/ref&gt; The admission of multiple realities (but only one actuality) is a [[leitmotiv]] in his work,&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 112&amp;ndash;13.&lt;/ref&gt; and he gave his second collection of poems, published in 1941, the title ''Solen har mange veje'' (The Sun Has Many Paths).&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Chronology, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with a much reprinted 1915 essay, "Primitiv Religion", he took a then revolutionary position with respect to "primitive" thought, rejecting the evolutionary hypothesis underlying works such as [[James George Frazer|Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]''&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Christian Aarslev, [http://www.religion.dk/viden/professoren-der-ville-g%C3%B8re-op-med-evolutionisme-i-religionsforskning "Professoren, der ville gøre op med evolutionisme i religionsforskning"], ''Kristeligt Dagblad'', 27 December 2011 {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and instead holding that so-called 'primitive' religion is as complex as modern religion, differing from it in the direct relationship between 'primitive' people and their world; he argued that to label a culture 'primitive' said less about them than about "our own astonishment that people can be different from us".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 36&amp;ndash;37.&lt;/ref&gt; This openness combined with his heavy use of paraphrase can make it hard to distinguish his own position from those of the thinkers he is depicting, for example in his presentation of [[Empedocles]]' thought in ''Hellas'', Volume 4.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grønbech did have a fundamental belief in the importance of "harmony", which he saw as the permeation of life by religion,&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 35, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; specifically as society constituting a "community of believers".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; He viewed emphasis on the individual as destructive to this and therefore criticised [[Kierkegaard]] in several of his works, once characterising him as "the last offshoot of medieval mysticism and its selfish concerns and the scholasticism which was identified with it".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 121, citing an essay on Kierkegaard and [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]] reprinted in ''Kampen om Mennesket'' (1930), p.&amp;nbsp;190.&lt;/ref&gt; He was critical of [[Goethe]], on whom he wrote a two-volume book (1935, 1939), because while seeking harmony, he did not appreciate the need for a community of believers.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast he appears to have felt a kinship with [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]]&lt;ref name=BioLex/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; and was ahead of literary fashion in his appreciation of both [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Schlegel]] and [[William Blake|Blake]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 76, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

In general Grønbech was suspicious of mystics as he regarded the mystical experience as inherently selfish; he reached this conclusion after an early mystical experience of his own.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; He made exceptions for, for example, [[Wordsworth]], whom he regarded as a mystic who had achieved harmony;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 44, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; in an entire volume of his work on mystics devoted to [[Teresa of Ávila|St Teresa]], he writes about her with "ironic humo[u]r" but characterises her as having "undermined the authority she was appealing to", contributing to the revolution in thought that "drew the human being out of his church's commonality".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; In his view as set out in his second major work, ''Religiøse strømninger i det nittende aarhundrede'' (Religious Currents of the Nineteenth Century, 1922; translated edition ''Religious Currents in the 19th Century'', 1964&lt;ref name=19threview/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thompsonreview&gt;[[Lawrence S. Thompson]], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27714919 Review of ''Religious Currents in the Nineteenth Century'' by Vilhelm Grønbech, translated P. M. Mitchell, W. D. Paden], ''[[The Journal of English and Germanic Philology]]'' 65.3 (July 1966) 574&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt;),&lt;ref name=Mitchell11/&gt; that revolution that ushered in the modern age of crisis in Western religion began not in the Sixteenth Century with the [[Protestant Reformation]] but around 1770 with the development of [[Romanticism]],&lt;ref name=Thompsonreview/&gt; and the [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]ian theory of evolution restored faith in a universe of laws and was the basis for a new religious harmony.&lt;ref name=19threview/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 40&amp;ndash;41, 48.&lt;/ref&gt; He also regarded the book as a vital means of uniting modern people in shared experience, "lift[ing] modern man out of his lonely imprisonment".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grønbech's book on Hellenism was an outgrowth of his work on a three-volume analysis of early Christianity, ''Jesus, menneskesønnen'' (Jesus, the Son of Man, 1935), ''Paulus'' (St Paul, 1940) and ''Kristus'' (Christ, 1941). He interpreted Jesus as "an agitator in the world of the spirit" who attempted to create the Kingdom of God on earth; the first book, ''Jesus'', is more simply written than other works of his and provoked negative responses, but became his most-read book.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 82&amp;ndash;85.&lt;/ref&gt; One reviewer of ''Jesus'' noted that a theme of Grønbech's, which he saw in Jesus, was the commandment to simply live, rather than to analyse morality.&lt;ref&gt;Ida Bachmann, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/40077612 Review of ''Jesus: Menneskessønnen'' by Vilhelm Grønbech], ''[[Books Abroad]]'' 10.4 (Autumn 1936) 425&amp;ndash;26.&lt;/ref&gt; The other two volumes, and the work on Hellenism, appeared only after Denmark was under occupation, and his treatment of Hellenistic Rome can often be read as applicable to his own period.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Grønbech's ideas were influential in Denmark, and reached a broad popular audience.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 21, 143.&lt;/ref&gt; His writings and in particular ''Frie Ord'' have often been said to have been the impetus for the establishment of ''[[Heretica]]'', an influential literary journal published from 1948 to 1953;&lt;ref name=SD/&gt; the third issue contains three articles written in tribute to him following his death, of which that by the poet and co-editor [[Thorkild Bjørnvig]] is titled "The Heretic".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 14, 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Grønbech Society was formed in Copenhagen in 1994.&lt;ref name=SD/&gt;&lt;ref name=revival/&gt;

'''European countries''' have had varying policies that confine '''women and military service''' or the extent of their participation in the national [[armed services]] of their respective countries, especially [[combatant]] roles in [[armed conflicts]] or hostile environments. While most of the countries have always allowed women to participate in military activities involving no direct aggression with the [[enemy]], most began seeing the value of servicewomen in the armed services during the [[First World War]] when they began losing unprecedented numbers of servicemen. In modern times many of the European countries now allow women to voluntarily pursue a [[career]] path or [[profession]] in the national armed services of their country as well as permit [[conscription]] equality, with minimal or no restrictions at all.

==Denmark==

Women were employed in the Danish armed forces as early as 1934 with the Ground Observer Corps, Danish Women's Army Corps and Naval Corps in 1946 and the Women's Air Force since 1953. In 1962 the Danish parliament passed laws allowing women to volunteer in the regular Danish armed forces as long as they did not serve in units experiencing direct combat. 1971 saw the enlistment of women as non-commissioned officers, with military academies allowing women in 1974.

In 1978, based on the reports of studies on the topic, women were allowed to enlist in an all areas of the Danish armed forces, with combat trials in the eighties exploring the capabilities of women in combat. In 1998 laws were passed allowing women to sample military life in the same way as conscripted men, however without being completely open to conscription. Women in the Danish military come under the command of the Chief of Defense.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.nato.int/ims/2001/win/denmark.htm NATO/IMS: Committee on Women in the NATO Forces: Denmark&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2009|7}} the highest rank reached by a woman in the Danish armed forces is Colonel (Susanne Bach Bager, Telegrafregimentet), with 5.2% (832) women in the services: 153 officers, 176 NCOs, and 503 privates (not counting women serving as "concripts").&lt;ref&gt;http://forsvaret.dk/FPT/Nyt%20og%20Presse/fakta/kvinderiforsvaret/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; From the summer 2007 to July 2009 a total of 84 women have served in the Danish Battalion in Helmand province, Afghanistan. This includes frontline service in infantry units and active participation in combat. However recent recruitment of women has been low in Denmark due to rising job opportunities elsewhere. NATO reports also indicate that the Danish military does not promote women to positions of leadership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

As with many nations with women in their armed forces, Denmark has different basic physical requirements for men and women in their armed forces, however the requirements for the more physically demanding jobs do not differ for either sex.

==Finland==

[[Image:Suomalaisia naissotilaita vannomassa sotilasvalaa.jpg|thumb|Finnish female soldiers swearing their military oath alongside male conscripts.]]
The [[Finnish Defense Forces]] does not conscript women. However, since 1995, women between 18 and 30 years of age have the possibility of voluntarily undertaking military service in the Defence Forces or in the [[Finnish Border Guard|Border Guard]]. Females serve under the same conditions as men, with the exception that during the first 45 days of service they have the option to leave the military without consequences. After that, they must complete the service which lasts 6, 9 or 12 months. After the service, the females face the same reserve obligations as the males who have done the obligatory military service. If the female in national service experiences a conscientious crisis which prevents her from fulfilling her military service or reserve obligations, she is ordered to the alternative civilian service, which lasts 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1995/19950194 Law on the voluntary military service for women (194/1995)] {{Fi}} Retrieved 2-20-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

All services and units in the Finnish Defence Forces and the Finnish Border Guard accept females. In garrison environment, the females are lodged in separate rooms and are given separate toilet and bath facilities. In exercises and aboard ships, women are lodged with men. The women in national service are given an extra allowance of €0,40 per diem for sanitary articles and smallclothes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/varusmies/naiset.dsp Finnish Defence Forces. Naiset armeijassa.] {{Fi}} Retrieved 2-20-2007&lt;/ref&gt; The females in military service are usually well motivated and some 60% of them receive either NCO or reserve officer training. Yearly, some 500 women complete the voluntary military service, while some 30,000 men complete the obligatory conscription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/varusmies/naisten_vapaaehtoinen_asepalvelus.dsp Finnish Defence Forces. Naiset voivat hakea kaikkiin joukko-osastoihin.] {{Fi}} Retrieved 2-20-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Lottia ilmavalvontatehtävissä.jpg|thumb|left|Members of Lotta Svärd in air control duty during the [[Continuation War]]]]
The women who have completed the voluntary military service are eligible for further military employment. If they have at least NCO training, they can apply for career NCO positions or for officer training. These career paths have been open since 1996, when the first women completed the military service. In 2005, 32 female career officers were in service. The number of female warrant officers was 16 and the number of female specialist officers 7. In comparison, there were a total of 2.584 officers and 894 specialist officers in service. The women made up about 16% of the total career NCO cadre. However, most of these career NCOs were grandfathered former female enlistees who had not undertaken military service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/perustietoa/toiminnantuloksellisuus/pdf/htp05.pdf Finnish Defence Forces.

[[Image:Naispunakaartilainen.jpg|thumb|upright|Female Red Guard soldier from [[Finnish Civil War]]]]
The history of women in the Finnish military is, however, far longer than just since 1995. During the [[Finnish Civil War]], the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Reds]] had several ''Naiskaarti'' (Women's Guard) units made of voluntary 16- to 35-year-old women, who were given rudimentary military training. The reactions on women in military were ambivalent during the Civil War. The fighting women of the Reds were shunned in the [[White Guard (Finland)|White]] propaganda but in the Red side propaganda they were admired and also compared to the "[[amazons]] of old".&lt;ref&gt;[http://vanha.hum.utu.fi/historia/raunistula/yhteiskunta/naiskaarti/kaarti7.html Hakala, A.

While the ''Lottas'' were not front line fighting units per sé, as a paramilitary organization they handled several important second-line duties freeing men to the actual fighting service. A voluntary Lotta unit manned a searchlight battery of Finnish [[anti-aircraft artillery]] in defense of Helsinki in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/ruotuvaki/index.dsp?action=read_page&amp;pid=36&amp;aid=530 Valonheitinlotat - ainutlaatuinen osa historiaa].

In 1961, the Finnish Defence Forces started to enlist females for second-line duties. The duties available to women were radar operator, sea-control person, and C3 person. Most of the female enlisted served in coastal artillery and [[Finnish Air Force]]. The women enlisted all served in the rank of ''värvätty'' (enlisted), using a special female uniform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soal.fi/tietopankki/index.php?group=00000210&amp;mag_nr=5 Sotilasammattiliitto SoAL ry.

The non-combat duties in Finnish Defence Forces [[peace-keeping]] operations opened to women in 1991. At first, the women without previous military training experienced rather large problems in the Finnish peace-keeping units, most remarkably in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] in the mid-1990s. Since the introduction of the voluntary military service, the women have mostly the same training as the men which has lessened the problems. Only a handful of women without military training, mostly nurses or social service personnel, are serving with the Finnish peace-keeping forces. All duties in Finnish foreign operations are open to women, provided they have the necessary military training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv3.fi/ohjelmat/45min_2003/arkisto.shtml?91386 Naisista tasa-arvoisia rauhanturvaajia.] MTV3 news service.

In the 1800s, women in the French military were responsible for preparing meals for soldiers, and were called [[Cantinières]]. They sold food to soldiers beyond that which was given to them as rations. Cantinières had commissions from the administrators of the regiments, and they were required to be married to a soldier of the regiment. They served near the front lines on active campaigns, and some served for as long as 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Following the drums: Cantinieres|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/c_cantinieres.html|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of women in the French military grew in 1914 with the recruitment of women as medical personnel (Service de Santé des Armées). In 1939, they were authorized to enlist with the armed service branches, and in 1972 their status evolved to share the same ranks as those of men. Nonetheless, women are still not permitted to join the field combat units or to be aboard the submarines of the French navy.

[[Valérie André]], a neurosurgeon, became the first woman in France to attain the rank of three-star general as Médecin Général Inspecteur. A veteran of the [[French Resistance]], she served overseas in [[Indochina]]. During that period, she learned how to pilot a helicopter so that she could reach wounded soldiers who were trapped in the jungle. André is the first woman to have flown a helicopter in combat. She received many decorations for her achievements, including the highest rank of the [[Legion of Honour]]. She retired from active service in 1981. Many other French women were involved in the [[Women in the French Resistance|French Resistance]].

==Germany==
[[Image:Ulrike Flender.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ulrike Flender]]—in 2007 became the first female [[German Air Force]] jet-fighter pilot and first German female [[Panavia Tornado]] pilot.]]

Since the creation of the [[Bundeswehr]] in 1955, Germany had employed one of the most conservative gender-policies of any NATO country. That was generally regarded as a reaction to the deployment of young women at the end of [[World War II]]. Though women were exempt from direct combat functions in accordance with Nazi-ideology, several hundred thousand German women, along with young boys and sometimes girls (as [[Flakhelfer]]), served in [[Luftwaffe]] artillery units; their flak shot down thousands of Allied warplanes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/H491/women-combat.htm D'Ann Campbell, "Women in Combat: The World War Two Experience in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union" ''Journal of Military History'' (April 1993), 57:301-323 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1975 the first female medical officers were appointed in the ''Sanitätsdienst'' ([[Medical corps]]) of the Bundeswehr. Since 1994, two women, [[Verena von Weymarn]] and Erika Franke, attained the rank of ''[[Generalarzt]]'' (Surgeon General). But it was not until January 2001 that women first joined German combat units, following a court ruling by the [[European Court of Justice]]. The change in the law was prompted after a qualified female [[electronics technician]] argued her case to the European Court of Justice after her application to join the Maintenance-Recovery Service (Electronics) technical unit of the German Armed Forces was rejected in 1996, citing "it is barred by German law for women to perform armed services". The court ruled that preventing women from occupying combat roles in the armed forces was against sexual equality principles. 244 of the first 1,900 women who signed up following the law change were admitted on the first day of the new rules, the majority of them joining the army and air force.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1097492.stm Women join German fighting forces]&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are no restrictions regarding the branch of service, and there are women serving in the ''[[Fallschirmjäger]]'' (paratrooper), aboard [[submarine]]s and jet-fighter aircraft. Before the law change 4,400 women only occupied [[military medicine]] or [[Military band|military-band]] roles within the German armed forces. The new legislations initially did not receive full military support. A report on the subject commented that, regarding the older male soldiers, "The way they see themselves as male fighters is shattered". Like many countries who have accepted women into combat roles, Germany conducts special courses on preventing sexual harassment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

After several years of experience the commotion inside the Bundeswehr has now remarkably decreased. Today women are regularly being sent to foreign deployments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1842630,00.html Germany Marks Five Years of Women in Armed Forces]&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2010 about 16,900 female soldiers serve in the Bundeswehr, representing a share of 9 percent of all troops except conscripted soldiers. The German Bundeswehr now expects the percentage of all female personnel to rise to about 15 percent in the middle-term future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundeswehr.de/portal/a/bwde/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLd443DgwBSUGYAfqR6GIBIQixoJRUfW99X4_83FT9AP2C3NCIckdHRQAlYgRn/delta/base64xml/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS80SVVFLzZfQ180QTc!?yw_contentURL=/C1256EF4002AED30/W27DXCZE807INFODE/content.jsp Starke Truppe – Immer mehr Frauen entscheiden sich für die Bundeswehr (Powerful troop - more and more women join the Bundeswehr)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the first woman in the German air force received her jet-fighter licence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesregierung.de/nn_6562/Content/EN/Artikel/2006/09/2006-09-26-erste-frau-im-jet-cockpit__en.html First woman to attain air force qualification as jet pilot]&lt;/ref&gt; A handful more are flying helicopters and transport planes.

==Ireland==
The Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1979, allowed women to join the [[Irish Defence Forces]] for the first time and was passed by the [[Oireachtas]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1979/en/act/pub/0028/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; There are no restrictions for women to the "full range of operational and administrative duties."&lt;ref&gt;http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0658/D.0658.200807020061.html&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2010 the number of women in the Permanent Defence Forces is 565, 5.7 percent of the total.&lt;ref&gt;http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20100224.xml&amp;Page=1&amp;Ex=1236#N1236&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
[[File:Italian Soldier Olypmic Games Turin 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Italian parachutist]]
During [[World War II]], the [[Italian Social Republic]] established the Female Volunteer Unit ({{lang-it|Corpo volontario femmnile}}) as an auxiliary service and their soldiers were known as Female Auxiliary Unit ({{lang-it|Servizio Ausiliario Femminile}}). The law that introduced this unit provided that its existence be limited to war periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.tiscali.it/RSI_ANALISI/34.htm|title=Decreto istitutivo del Corpo femminile|access-date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its equivalent in [[Southern Italy]] during World War II, was the ''CAF'', {{lang-it|Corpo di Assistenza Femminile}}, that was on the side of the [[Allies]]. This unit was also dismissed at the end of the war. Those who belonged to this unit were equivalent to [[sub-lieutenants]] and wore military uniforms made in [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museobadoglio.altervista.org/docs/forze.pdf|title=Forze del Regno del Sud|access-date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, the Female Police unit ({{lang-it|Corpo di Polizia femminile}}) was established.

In 1981, Diadora Bussani was the first woman who asked to be admitted  into the [[Italian Naval Academy]] of [[Livorno]] ({{lang-it|Accademia navale di Livorno}}). She was born in 1962 in [[Trieste]] and started to try to join the academy in 1981. After being excluded from the application, Italy's regional administrative court upheld the appeal; however, Italy's State Council overturned the judgment. The enlisting of a woman seemed to be legally feasible because of the Italian law Legge 1963 n. 66, which allowed the enrollment of women in public positions, but Italy's State Council excluded the military because of biological differences between male and female human bodies. When Diadora Bussani became famous and the case was well-known, the [[United States Navy]] symbolically granted her enlistment on 2 November 1982.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bloogger.it/2018/06/italiane-in-armi/&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntary female military service was introduced in 1999 with the Italian law Legge 20 ottobre 1999 n. 380, which introduced the possibility of being admitted to the army for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informagiovani.it/frame/_donnemiliti.htm Informagiovani]&lt;/ref&gt; Italy was the last country among [[NATO]] members to allow women to deploy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Editoria/Rassegna+Arma/2004/Suppl_3/I+Sessione/01_Sessione_03.htm#3 L'impatto del servizio militare femminile.

Nowadays women are present in all branches of Italian armed forces, including the police, and the [[Guardia di Finanza]], and they are also employed for military missions abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.difesa.it/APPROFONDIMENTI/ARCHIVIOAPPROFONDIMENTI/SERVIZIO_FEMMINILE/Pagine/default.aspx Ministero della Difesa]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the year 2000, women were employed in war only as voluntary nurses inside the organizations [[Croce Rossa Italiana]] and of [[Corpo delle infermiere volontarie dell'ACISMOM]]. 235º Reggimento fanteria "Piceno" is the training center for women inside the Italian army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esercito.difesa.it/organizzazione/capo-di-sme/comando-per-la-formazione-specializzazione-e-dottrina-dell-esercito/Scuola-di-Fanteria/Centro-Addestramento-Volontari/235-RAV-Piceno Esercito.difesa]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norway==
Women in Norway have been serving in military roles since 1938. During the Second World War both enlisted women and female officers served in all branches of the military. However, in 1947 political changes commanded that women only serve in civilian posts, with reservists allowing women to join in 1959.

Between 1977 and 1984, the Norwegian Parliament passed laws expanding the role of women in the Norwegian Armed Forces, and in 1985 equal opportunities legislation was applied to the military. 
In 1995, Norway became the first country to allow women to serve on its military [[submarines]]

In a further step in favour of gender equality in the armed services, the Norwegian parliament voted, with a strong majority, the 14th of June 2014, a [[Bill (law)|bill]] to extend [[Conscription|compulsory military service]] to females from mid-2016. Norway is the first NATO member and first European country to make national service compulsory for both sexes.&lt;ref name="NMMSW"&gt;[http://rt.com/news/197152-norway-army-women-military-conscripts/ Girls in the army: Norway passes bill on mandatory military service for women]&lt;/ref&gt; It will apply to all medically fit Norwegian citizens between age 19-44 born from 1997 onwards.&lt;ref name="NMMSW" /&gt; Women born in 1997 and onwards will also be subject to conscription during wartime.&lt;ref name="NMMSW" /&gt;

As of 2017, 1341 of the 11596 military personnel in the Norwegian military forces were women (12%). Of all the conscriped soldiers the same year, the female percentage was 23%. c&lt;ref&gt;https://forsvaret.no/fakta_/ForsvaretDocuments/Forsvarets_aarsrapport_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2017, major general Tonje Skinnarland became the first-ever appointed woman to be the head of the Royal Norwegian air force.

==Poland==
Women have taken part in the battles for independence against occupiers and invaders since at least the time of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During the occupation by the [[Nazi]]s, 1939–1945, several thousand women took part in the resistance movement as members of the [[Home Army]]. The Germans were forced to establish special [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s after the [[Warsaw Rising]] in 1944 to accommodate over a thousand women prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polishresistance-ak.org/12%20Article.htm Women in Home Army]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1938 the law requiring compulsory military service for men included provisions for voluntary service of women in auxiliary roles, in the medical services, in the anti-aircraft artillery and in communications. In 1939 a Women's Military Training Organization was established under the command of [[Maria Wittek]].

In present Poland a law passed April 6, 2004 requires all women with college [[nursing]] or [[veterinary]] degrees to register for compulsory service. In addition it allows women to volunteer and serve as professional personnel in all services of the army. As of June 30, 2007 there are 800 women in the army, of which 471 are officers, 308 non-commissioned officers and 21 other ranks, in addition 225 are in military training schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kadry.wp.mil.pl/artykul.php?idartykul=20 Women in army - in Polish]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russia==
{{Main| Women in the Russian and Soviet military}}

The first woman known to have enlisted in the Russian Army was [[Nadezhda Durova]] who, pretending to be a man, fought with distinction in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. At that time, however, she was very much of a unique exception in an all-male army.

During the [[First World War]], heavy defeats led to the loss of millions of [[Russian Empire|Russian Imperial]] soldiers. To psychologically energize morale [[Alexander Kerensky]] (leader of Russia of the [[Russian Provisional Government]]) ordered the creation of the Woman’s Death Battalion in May 1917. After three months of fighting, the size of this all-female unit fell from 2,000 to 250.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wdeath.htm Women's Death Battalion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1917, the [[Bolsheviks]] dissolved the unit. Shortly after Russia became part of the [[Soviet Union]] (see above for the role of woman in Soviet military) till December 1991.

The current tally of woman in the Russian Army is standing at around 115,000 to 160,000, representing 10% of Russia’s military strength.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} They're not allowed in combat roles, however.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The Russian army runs the [[Miss Russian Army]] beauty contest for attractive female Russian soldiers.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Colonel Gennady Dzyuba, of the Defense Ministry, said of the 2005 contest that "Those who have served, especially in hot spots, know the importance of women in the [[armed forces]]."{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Soviet Union: 1917–1991===

{{Main| Soviet women in the Great Patriotic War}}
Women had the legal right to serve in the [[Red Army|Soviet Armed Forces]] throughout the post Second World War period, with many all-female units existing as far back as World War One. By the early 1990s, 100,000 women made up 3% of the Soviet Armed Forces.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:LyudmilaPavlichenko1.jpg|thumb|Lyudmila Pavlichenko]] --&gt;

During the Second World War, the Soviet Union had a female military strength of over one million women [http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1982/jan-feb/obrien.html] who served as snipers, machine gunners, and tank crew members. Very few of these women, however, were ever promoted to officers.

In 1942 the [[Soviet Union]] formed three regiments of women combat pilots to fly night bombing missions over Germany, the 588th Night Bomber Regiment, later called the 46th Taman Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment. These women took part in regular harassment bombing against the Germans in [[Polikarpov Po-2]] biplanes, and participated in the final onslaught against Berlin. The regiments, collectively known to the Germans as the "Nachthexen" ("[[Night Witches]]"), flew more than 24,000 sorties and won in total 23 [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] medals. Some of the most talented women pilots were assigned day fighter duties. [[Lydia Litvyak|"Lily" Litvak]] and [[Katya Budanova]] became fighter aces flying the Soviet Union's best fighter designs alongside men in day attacks. Both were killed in their aircraft. Meanwhile, in the ground combat role [[Lyudmila Pavlichenko]], made 309 confirmed kills including 36 enemy snipers. Pavlichenko was one of the many female snipers of the Soviet Army.

In 1967, the Soviet Universal Military Duty Laws concluded that women offered the greater source of available combat soldiers during periods of large-scale mobilisation. Thus, several programs during the height of the cold war were set up to encourage women to enlist. Participation in military orientated youth programs and forced participation in the reserves for ex-servicewomen up to the age of 40 are some examples. Universities contained reservist officer training which accompanied a place in the reserves themselves.

In the Soviet Union civil universities, in addition to professional education, gave basic military training to the youth of both sexes. Many secondary schools in [[post-Soviet countries]] still have defense lessons, both for boys and girls.

==Serbia==
 {{commonscat|Military women of Serbia}}
Although the Serbian combat forces were traditionally exclusively male (with exception of nurses and some other non-combat roles) there were some exceptions. Several women are known to have fought in the ranks in the [[Balkan Wars]] and the [[First World War]], often by initially hiding their gender to work around the draft regulations. The most notable of them was [[Milunka Savić]]. In the [[Second World War]] [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav partisan units]] accepted female volunteers as combatants as well as medical personnel. After the war the practice was abandoned, but was reintroduced recently with professionalisation of the army.

In Yugoslavia (including Serbia and other states), two million women were directly involved in non-combat support roles with Yugoslavia's partisans, and 100,000 served in the partisan army during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jancar, "Women in the Yugoslav National Liberation Movement: An Overview," ''Studies in Comparative Communism'' (1981) 14#2 pp 143-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==
In the Military Articles of 1621, which organized the Swedish army, military men on all levels were explicitly allowed to bring their wives with them to war, as the wives were regarded to fill an important role as [[sutler]]s in the house hold organisation of the army: prostitutes, however, were banned.&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"&gt;Sjöberg, Maria: ''Kvinnor i fält 1550-1850.'' [Women in Combat] Gidlund (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  This regulation was kept until the Military Article of 1798, though the presence of women diminished after the end of the [[Great Northern War]].&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt; In the Military Article of 1798, the only women allowed to accompany the army was the professional unmarried female sutlers, in Sweden named ''marketenterska''.&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt; Unofficially, however, there were females who served in the army posing as male the entire period, the most famous being [[Ulrika Eleonora Stålhammar]].&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt;

In 1924, the [[Swedish Women's Voluntary Defence Service]] (Swedish: Riksförbundet Sveriges lottakårer, commonly known as Lottorna) was founded: it is an auxiliary defense organization of the [[Swedish Home Guard]], a part of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]].

Since 1989 there are no gender restrictions in the Swedish military on access to military training or positions. They are allowed to serve in all parts of the military and in all positions, including combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rekryc.mil.se/article.php?id%3D11756 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927045646/http://www.rekryc.mil.se/article.php?id=11756 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} in Swedish, Retrieved 04-23-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkey==
[[File:Breguet 19 Sabiha.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Sabiha Gökçen]] was the first female pilot to fly during a conflict, 1937]]
When Turkish history is examined, it is apparent that Turkish women have voluntarily taken tasks in the defence of their country, showing the same power and courage as men. [[Nene Hatun]], whose monument has been erected in the city of Erzurum (Eastern Turkey) because of her gallant bravery during the Ottoman-Russian War, constitutes a very good example of this fact. Furthermore, the Independence War has taken its place in history with the unsurpassed heroism of Turkish women.&lt;ref name="nato.int"&gt;http://www.nato.int/ims/2001/win/turkey.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sabiha Gökçen]] was the first female combat pilot in the world, as well as the first Turkish female aviator. She was one of the eight adoptive children of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]. Throughout her career in the Turkish Air Force, Gökçen flew 22 different types of aircraft for more than 8,000 hours, 32 hours of which were active combat and bombardment missions. She was selected as the only female pilot for the poster of "20 Greatest Aviators in History" published by the United States Air Force in 1996.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/gokcen.html Sabiha Gokcen (1913-2001), Pioneer Aviatrix&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Women personnel are being employed as officers in the Turkish Armed Forces today. The women officers serve together with the men under the same respective chains of command. The personnel policy regarding women in the Turkish Armed Forces is based on the principle of "needing qualified women officers in suitable branches and ranks" to keep pace with technological advancements in the 21st century. Women civilian personnel have been assigned to the headquarters staff, technical fields, and social services without sexual discrimination. Women officers serve in all branches except armour, infantry, and submarines. Assignments, promotions and training are considered on an equal basis with no gender bias.&lt;ref name="nato.int"/&gt;

As of the year 2005, the number of the female officers and NCOs in the Turkish Armed Forces is 1245.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.nato.int/ims/2005/win/national_reports/turkey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Women may now join the British Armed forces in all roles except those whose "primary duty is to close with and kill the enemy": [[British Army Infantry|Infantry]], [[Household Cavalry]], [[Royal Armoured Corps]], [[Royal Marines|Royal Marines Commandos]], [[RAF Regiment]], [[Special Air Service]] and [[Special Boat Service]]. In addition medical reasons{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} used to preclude service in the [[Royal Navy Submarine Service]] or as Mine Clearance Divers, but in May 2014 it was announced that three women had become the RN's first female submariners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Royal Navy gets first female submariners|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27278588|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are however, permitted access to special force's support units, such as commando engineers and are cleared to join the [[Special Reconnaissance Regiment]], a largely unknown branch of the [[United Kingdom Special Forces]] that does not bar women from joining.

Female personnel currently make up around 9% of the British armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FactSheets/WomenInTheArmedForces.htm Defence Factsheet, Women in the Armed Forces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929073139/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FactSheets/WomenInTheArmedForces.htm |date=2012-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, female combatants can be found throughout Britain’s military history.&lt;ref&gt;BBC news [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6502847.stm article] on Women in Combat, retrieved on March 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example is Queen [[Boudica]], who led warriors of the Iceni tribe against Roman forces occupying Britain around AD 62, her legacy being often quoted in support of arguments calling for the full opening up of the British Armed forces to women.

In the medieval period, Queens and noblewomen such as [[Ethelfleda]] of Mercia, [[Matilda of England]], [[Isabella of France]] and [[Margaret of Anjou]] commanded armies in battle, although they did not fight themselves. Many women including Queen [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] accompanied their husbands on Crusade. In the 16th century [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], accompanied troops in several campaigns. Women continued to lead armies or organise the defense of castles in the absence of their male relatives until the close of the [[English Civil War]]. Charles I's consort, [[Henrietta Maria of France]] was the last English queen to command troops in battle in northern England in 1643.

During the 1776 American War of Independence, it is estimated that over 5,000 women accompanied British forces. Many of these would have been the wives of high-ranking officers, with a large proportion being the wives of serving soldiers. While as much as possible women were left in the camp, they sometimes accompanied forces in their baggage trains serving as cooks or nurses, and were occasionally caught in combat and killed or taken prisoner. Similarly women accompanied men in ships of the [[Royal Navy]], in combat being employed as powder monkeys or assisting [[surgeon]]s.

During [[World War I]] the British Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps was formed; Lieutenant-General H Lawson recommended using it in France in 1917. Sir Neville Macready, the Adjutant-General, supported the idea that women and men should be treated the same at the front. Women served in the British Army during World War One as cooks, medical staff and clerical staff, however women were not permitted to be officers, and there were many disputes over pay. In 1917 the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] (WRNS) was formed, although then disbanded in 1919 It provided catering and administrative support, communications and electrician personnel.

Prior to [[World War II]], in 1938 the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) was created, with 20,000 women serving in non-combat roles during the conflict as well as serving as military police. Some women took part in direct combat roles as part of mixed gender teams manning heavy anti-aircraft batteries and gun crews within Britain. Women members of the teams might sight and aim anti-aircraft guns and even give the command to fire, but the actual release of the trigger was always (officially at least) reserved for a male soldier. A number of women operated on active service in wartime Europe with special services, engaged in intelligence, sabotage and laison with local resistance groups. During the war, the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry was incorporated into the ATS. The WRNS was reformed at the outbreak of war in 1939, with an increased range of shore-based opportunities available.

In 1949 women were officially recognized as a permanent part of British Armed forces, although full combat roles were still available only to men. In this year, the Women's Royal Army Corps was created to replace the WAAC, and in 1950 the ranks were normalised with the ranks of men serving in the British Army.

The 1991 Gulf War marked the first deployment of British women in combat operations since 1945. Women were engaged in a broad range of support operations up to 8&amp;nbsp;km from the front line. In 1992 British Army units devoted only to women were disbanded, and women were distributed amongst the same units in which men served. During the 1990s an increasing number of roles were opened up to women including direct combat support roles in intelligence, artillery, engineering and signals.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Woodward, Trish Winter, ''Sexing the soldier: the politics of gender and the contemporary British Army,'' Routledge, (2007) pp. 33-35&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 seagoing opportunities were opened to WRNS personnel leading to the full integration of the WRNS with the Royal Navy in 1993. To date several female personnel have commanded small ships of the RN and a recently retired Commanding Officer of [[HMNB Clyde|HM Naval Base, Clyde]], Commodore Carolyn Stait, is a former WRNS Officer.

The [[2007 Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel|seizure]] of [[Royal Navy]] sailor [[Faye Turney]] in 2007 by the [[Navy of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution|naval forces of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard]] led to some media comment on the role of women and mothers in the armed forces.&lt;ref name="indy"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article2411286.ece |title= Only the capture of Prince Harry could have done more damage |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=2007-04-01 |accessdate=2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[commander-in-chief]] of the British Armed Forces is a woman ([[Queen Elizabeth II]]) though her position is only nominal.

A '''zoo''' (short for '''zoological garden''' or '''zoological park''' and also called an '''animal park''' or '''menagerie''') is a facility in which all [[Animal|animals]] are housed within enclosures, displayed to the public, and in which they may also breed.

The term "zoological garden" refers to [[zoology]], the study of animals, a term deriving from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''zōon'' (ζῷον, 'animal') and ''lógos'' (λóγος, 'study'). The abbreviation "zoo" was first used of the [[London Zoological Gardens]], which was opened for scientific study in 1828 and to the public in 1857.&lt;ref name=ZSL&gt;[http://www.zsl.org/info/about-us/zsls-history,129,AR.html "ZSL's history"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228235326/http://www.zsl.org/info/about-us/zsls-history%2C129%2CAR.html |date=February 28, 2008 }}, Zoological Society of London.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of major animal collections open to the public around the world now exceeds 1,000 and approximately 80 percent of them are in cities.&lt;ref name=EBZoo/&gt; In the [[United States]] alone, zoos are visited by  over 180 million people annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visitor Demographics|url=https://www.aza.org/partnerships-visitor-demographics|website=[[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]]|accessdate=7 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The [[London Zoo]], which opened in 1826, was initially known as the "Gardens and Menagerie of the Zoological Society of London", and it described itself as a [[menagerie]] or "zoological forest".&lt;ref name=Blunt29&gt;Blunt 1976; Reichenbach 2002, pp. 151–163.&lt;/ref&gt; The abbreviation "zoo" first appeared in print in the United Kingdom around 1847, when it was used for the [[Bristol Zoo|Clifton Zoo]], but it was not until some 20 years later that the shortened form became popular in the song "[[Walking in the Zoo]]" by music-hall artist [[Alfred Vance]].&lt;ref name=Blunt29/&gt; The term "zoological park" was used for more expansive facilities in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], [[National Zoological Park (United States)|Washington, D.C.]], and the [[Bronx Zoo|Bronx]] in New York, which opened in 1847, 1891 and 1899 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Hyson 2000, p. 29; Hyson 2003, pp. 1356-1357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively new terms for zoos coined in the late 20th century are "conservation park" or "biopark". Adopting a new name is a strategy used by some zoo professionals to distance their institutions from the stereotypical and nowadays criticized zoo concept of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Maple 1995, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "biopark" was first coined and developed by the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo in Washington D.C.]] in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson 1987a, pp. 10-17; Robinson 1987b, pp. 678-682.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, the New York Zoological Society changed its name to the [[Wildlife Conservation Society]] and rebranded the zoos under its jurisdiction as "wildlife conservation parks".&lt;ref&gt;Conway 1995, pp. 259-276.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Royal menageries ===
{{further information|Menagerie}}
[[File:towrlndn.JPG|thumb|upright|right|The [[Tower of London]] housed [[England]]'s royal menagerie for several centuries (Picture from the 15th century, [[British Library]]).]]

The predecessor of the zoological garden is the [[menagerie]], which has a long history from the ancient world to modern times. The oldest known zoological collection was revealed during excavations at [[Hierakonpolis]], [[Egypt]] in 2009, of a ca. 3500 BCE menagerie. The exotic animals included [[hippopotamus|hippopotami]], [[hartebeest]], [[elephant]]s, [[baboon]]s and [[wildcat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;World's First Zoo - Hierakonpolis, Egypt, ''Archaeology Magazine'', http://www.archaeology.org/1001/topten/egypt.html&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Ashur-bel-kala]] of the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] created zoological and botanical gardens in the 11th century BCE. In the 2nd century BCE, the [[Emperor of China|Chinese Empress]] Tanki had a "house of deer" built, and [[King Wen of Zhou]] kept a {{convert|1500|acre|km2|adj=on}} zoo called ''Ling-Yu,'' or the Garden of Intelligence. Other well-known collectors of animals included [[King Solomon]] of the [[United Monarchy|Kingdom of Israel and Judah]], queen [[Semiramis]] and King [[Ashurbanipal]] of [[Assyria]], and King [[Nebuchadrezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] of [[Babylonia]].&lt;ref name=EBZoo&gt;"Zoo," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 4th century BCE, zoos existed in most of the Greek city states; [[Alexander the Great]] is known to have sent animals that he found on his military expeditions back to Greece. The Roman emperors kept private collections of animals for study or for use in the arena,&lt;ref name=EBZoo/&gt; the latter faring notoriously poorly. The 19th-century historian [[William Edward Hartpole Lecky|W. E. H. Lecky]] wrote of the [[Ludi Romani|Roman games]], first held in 366 BCE:

{{quote|At one time, a [[bear]] and a [[bull]], chained together, rolled in fierce combat across the sand ... Four hundred bears were killed in a single day under [[Caligula]] ... Under [[Nero]], four hundred [[tiger]]s fought with bulls and elephants. In a single day, at the dedication of the [[Colosseum]] by [[Titus]], five thousand animals perished. Under [[Trajan]] ... [[lion]]s, tigers, elephants, [[rhinoceros]]es, hippopotami, giraffes, bulls, stags, even crocodiles and serpents were employed to give novelty to the spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;Lecky, W.E.H. ''History of European Morals from Augustus to Charlemagne''. Vol. 1, Longmans, 1869, pp. 280-282.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Charlemagne]] had an elephant named [[Abul-Abbas]] that was given to him by the Abbasid Caliph. [[Henry I of England]] kept a collection of animals at his palace in [[Woodstock, Oxfordshire|Woodstock]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;which reportedly included lions, leopards, and camels.&lt;ref name=Blunt15&gt;Blunt, Wilfred. ''The Ark in the Park: The Zoo in the Nineteenth Century''. Hamish Hamilton, 1976, pp. 15-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent collection in medieval England was in the [[Tower of London]], created as early as 1204 by King [[John I of England|John I]].

[[Henry III of England|Henry III]] received a wedding gift in 1235 of three leopards from [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], and in 1264, the animals were moved to the Bulwark, renamed the Lion Tower, near the main western entrance of the Tower. It was opened to the public during the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4371908.stm "Big cats prowled London's tower"], BBC News, October 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th century, the price of admission was three half-pence, or the supply of a cat or dog for feeding to the lions.&lt;ref name=Blunt15/&gt; The animals were moved to the London Zoo when it opened.

[[Aztec]] emperor [[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]] had in his capital city of [[Tenochtitlan]] a "house of animals" with a large collection of birds, mammals and reptiles in a garden tended by more than 600 employees. The garden was described by several Spanish conquerors, including [[Hernán Cortés]] in 1520. After the Aztec revolt against the Spanish rule, and during the subsequent battle for the city, Cortés reluctantly ordered the zoo to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martín del Campo y Sánchez|first1=Rafael|title=El parque zoológico de Moctezuma en Tenochtitlán|url=http://repositorio.fciencias.unam.mx:8080/jspui/bitstream/11154/143305/1/38VParqueZool%C3%B3gico.pdf|accessdate=9 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enlightenment Era ===
[[File:Versailles M2.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] menagerie during the reign of [[Louis XIV]] in the 17th century]]
{{further information|List of zoos}}

The oldest zoo in the world still in existence is the [[Tiergarten Schönbrunn]] in [[Vienna]], Austria. It was constructed by [[Adrian van Stekhoven]] in 1752 at the order of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], husband of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], to serve as an imperial [[menagerie]] as part of [[Schönbrunn Palace]]. The menagerie was initially reserved for the viewing pleasure of the imperial family and the court, but was made accessible to the public in 1765.

In 1775, a zoo was founded in Madrid, and in 1795, the zoo inside the ''[[Jardin des Plantes]]'' in Paris was founded by [[Jacques-Henri Bernardin de Saint-Pierre|Jacques-Henri Bernardin]], with animals from the royal menagerie at Versailles, primarily for scientific research and education. The [[Kazan Zoo]], the first zoo in [[Russia]] was founded in 1806 by the Professor of [[Kazan State University]] [[Karl Fuchs (museum founder)|Karl Fuchs]].

=== The modern zoo ===
Until the early 19th century, the function of the zoo was often to symbolize royal power, like King [[Louis XIV]]'s [[menagerie]] at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. The modern zoo that emerged in the early 19th century at [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]], [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[Dublin]], was focused on providing educational exhibits to the public for entertainment and inspiration.&lt;ref name=Zsl2012&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zsl.org/education/the-modern-zoo/introducing-the-modern-zoo,438,AR.html |title=Introducing the Modern Zoo|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A growing fascination for [[natural history]] and [[zoology]], coupled with the tremendous expansion in the [[urbanization]] of [[London]], led to a heightened demand for a greater variety of public forms of entertainment to be made available. The need for public entertainment, as well as the requirements of scholarly research, came together in the founding of the first modern zoos.
[[File:View of the Zoological Gardens1835.jpg|thumb|[[London Zoo]], 1835]]

The [[Zoological Society of London]] was founded in 1826 by [[Stamford Raffles]] and established the [[London Zoo]] in [[Regent's Park]] two years later in 1828.&lt;ref name="science-history"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.todayinsci.com/4/4_27.htm | title = April 27 | publisher = Today in Science History | accessdate =5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its founding, it was the world's first scientific zoo.&lt;ref name=EBZoo/&gt;&lt;ref name="ZSL-history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zsl.org/info/about-us/zsls-history,129,AR.html |title=ZSL's History |publisher=[[Zoological Society of London|ZSL]] |accessdate=5 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228235326/http://www.zsl.org/info/about-us/zsls-history%2C129%2CAR.html |archivedate=28 February 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally intended to be used as a collection for [[science|scientific study]], it was eventually opened to the public in 1847.&lt;ref name="ZSL-history" /&gt; The Zoo was located in [[Regent's Park]] - then undergoing development at the hands of the architect [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]. What set the London zoo apart from its predecessors was its focus on society at large. The zoo was established in the middle of a city for the public, and its layout was designed to cater for the large London population. The London zoo was widely copied as the archetype of the public city zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designforlife.com.sg/thesis/12history.html|title=The Role of Architectural Design in Promoting the Social Objectives of Zoos|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853, the Zoo opened the world's first [[public aquarium]].

[[Downs' Zoological Gardens]] created by [[Andrew Downs]] and opened to the Nova Scotia public in 1847. It was originally intended to be used as a collection for scientific study. By the early 1860s, the zoo grounds covered 40 hectares with many fine flowers &amp; ornamental trees, picnic areas, statues, walking paths, The Glass House (which contained a greenhouse with an aviary, aquarium, &amp; museum of stuffed animals &amp; birds), a pond, a bridge over a waterfall, an artificial lake with a fountain, a wood-ornamented greenhouse, a forest area, and enclosures &amp; buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cu0SAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Andrew+Downs%22+Halifax&amp;dq=%22Andrew+Downs%22+Halifax&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiIhN3K06vTAhWhgVQKHdKdB1wQ6AEIMzAD|title=The Dalhousie Review|first=Herbert Leslie|last=Stewart|date=29 December 2017|publisher=Dalhousie University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/halifax-zoological-gardens-1.3207653|title=Did you know the first zoo in Canada and the U.S. was in Halifax?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.saltscapes.com/people-culture-section/people-culture-category/1089-zoo-diary.html|title=Zoo Diary - Saltscapes Magazine|first=Scott|last=Noble|website=Saltscapes Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dublin Zoo]] was opened in 1831 by members of the medical profession interested in studying animals while they were alive and more particularly getting hold of them when they were dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/lifestyle/the-great-zoos-who-2669960.html | work=Irish Independent | first=John | last=Costello | title=The great zoo's who | date=June 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first zoological garden in [[Australia]] was [[Melbourne Zoo]] in 1860. In the same year, [[Central Park Zoo]], the first public zoo in the United States, opened in New York, although in 1859, the [[Philadelphia Zoo|Philadelphia Zoological Society]] had made an effort to establish a zoo, but delayed opening it until 1874 because of the [[American Civil War]].

In 1907, the [[Germany|German]] entrepreneur [[Carl Hagenbeck]] founded the [[Tierpark Hagenbeck]] in Stellingen, now a quarter of [[Hamburg]]. His zoo was a radical departure from the layout of the zoo that had been established in 1828. It was the first zoo to use open enclosures surrounded by moats, rather than barred cages, to better approximate animals' natural environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=[[National Audubon Society]] |work=Audubon Magazine |title=The New Zoo |url=http://audubonmagazine.org/features0111/newzoo.html |author=Rene S.

When [[ecology]] emerged as a matter of public interest in the 1970s, a few zoos began to consider making conservation their central role, with [[Gerald Durrell]] of the [[Durrell Wildlife Park|Jersey Zoo]], George Rabb of [[Brookfield Zoo]], and William Conway of the [[Bronx Zoo]] ([[Wildlife Conservation Society]]) leading the discussion. From then on, zoo professionals became increasingly aware of the need to engage themselves in conservation programs, and the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums|American Zoo Association]] soon said that conservation was its highest priority.&lt;ref&gt;See Kisling, Vernon N. (ed.): ''Zoo and Aquarium History'', Boca Raton 2001. {{ISBN|0-8493-2100-X}}; Hoage, R. J. Deiss and William A.

''A Different Nature'', Berkeley 2001. {{ISBN|0-520-21879-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to stress conservation issues, many large zoos stopped the practice of having animals perform tricks for visitors. The [[Detroit Zoo]], for example, stopped its elephant show in 1969, and its chimpanzee show in 1983, acknowledging that the trainers had probably abused the animals to get them to perform.&lt;ref&gt;Donahue, Jesse and Trump, Erik. ''Political Animals: Public Art in American Zoos and Aquariums''.
Lexington Books, 2007, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Whipsnade Park]] in [[Bedfordshire]], [[England]], was opened in 1931 as the first safari park. It allowed visitors to drive through the enclosures and come into close proximity with the animals.

The [[Wrocław Zoo]] ({{lang-pl|Ogród Zoologiczny we Wrocławiu}}), the oldest zoo in Poland opened in 1865 and was home to about 10,500 animals representing about 1,132 species (in terms of the number of animal species it is the third largest in the world&lt;ref&gt;[http://wroclaw.wyborcza.pl/wroclaw/1,35771,19502168,wielkie-liczenie-w-zoo-we-wroclawiu-zobacz-ile-zwierzat-w.html Wielkie liczenie w zoo we Wrocławiu.

In 2014 the Wrocław Zoo opened the [[Africarium]], the only themed [[oceanarium]] devoted solely to exhibiting the [[fauna of Africa]], comprehensively presenting selected ecosystems from the continent of [[Africa]].

[[habitat destruction|Mass destruction of wildlife habitat]] has yet to cease all over the world and many species such as [[elephants]], big cats, [[Penguin|penguins]], tropical birds, primates, [[Rhinoceros|rhinos]], exotic reptiles, and many others are in danger of dying out. Many of today's zoos hope to stop or slow the decline of many endangered species and see their primary purpose as breeding endangered species in captivity and reintroducing them into the wild. Modern zoos also aim to help teach visitors the importance on animal conservation, often through letting visitors witness the animals firsthand.&lt;ref name="Masci, David 2014"&gt;Masci, David. "Zoos in the 21st Century." CQ Researcher 28 Apr. 2000: 353-76. Web. 26 Jan. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics and the majority of animal rights activists say that zoos, no matter what their intentions are, or how noble they are, are immoral and serve as nothing but to fulfill human leisure at the expense of the animals (which is an opinion that has spread over the years). However, zoo advocates argue that their efforts make a difference in wildlife conservation and education.&lt;ref name="Masci, David 2014"/&gt;

=== Human exhibits ===
[[File:Ota Benga at Bronx Zoo.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ota Benga]], a human exhibit in New York, 1906]]
{{further information|Human zoo|Scientific racism|Social Darwinism}}

Human beings were sometimes displayed in cages along with non-human animals, to illustrate the differences between people of [[Europe]]an and non-European origin. In September 1906, [[William Temple Hornaday|William Hornaday]], director of the [[Bronx Zoo]] in New York&amp;mdash;with the agreement of [[Madison Grant]], head of the [[New York Zoological Society]]&amp;mdash;had [[Ota Benga]], a Congolese [[pygmy]], displayed in a cage with the chimpanzees, then with an [[orangutan]] named Dohong, and a parrot. The exhibit was intended as an example of the "missing link" between the orangutan and white man. It triggered protests from the city's clergymen, but the public reportedly flocked to see it.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, Phillips Verner and Blume, Harvey. ''Ota Benga: The Pygmy in the Zoo''.  St. Martins Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTBenga&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C04E7D81F3EE733A25753C1A96F9C946797D6CF "Man and Monkey Show Disapproved by Clergy"], ''The New York Times'', September 10, 1906.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human beings were also displayed in cages during the 1931 [[Paris Colonial Exposition]], and as late as 1958 in a "Congolese village" display at [[Expo '58]] in Brussels.&lt;ref&gt;Blanchard, Pascal; Bancel, Nicolas; and Lemaire, Sandrine.

Zoo animals live in enclosures that often attempt to replicate their natural [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]s or behavioral patterns, for the benefit of both the animals and visitors. [[Nocturnal]] animals are often housed in buildings with a reversed light-dark cycle, i.e. only dim white or red lights are on during the day so the animals are active during visitor hours, and brighter lights on at night when the animals sleep. Special climate conditions may be created for animals living in extreme environments, such as penguins. Special enclosures for [[bird]]s, [[mammal]]s, [[insect]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[fish]], and other aquatic life forms have also been developed. Some zoos have walk-through exhibits where visitors enter enclosures of non-aggressive species, such as [[lemur]]s, [[marmoset]]s, birds, [[lizard]]s, and [[turtle]]s. Visitors are asked to keep to paths and avoid showing or eating foods that the animals might snatch.

=== Safari park ===
{{main article|Safari park}}
[[File:Giraffes at west midlands safari park.jpg|thumb|right|[[Giraffe]]s in the [[West Midland Safari Park]]]]

Some zoos keep animals in larger, outdoor enclosures, confining them with [[moat]]s and fences, rather than in cages. [[Safari park]]s, also known as zoo parks and lion farms, allow visitors to drive through them and come in close proximity to the animals.&lt;ref name=EBZoo/&gt; Sometimes, visitors are able to feed animals through the car windows. The first safari park was [[Whipsnade Zoo|Whipsnade Park]] in Bedfordshire, England, opened by the [[Zoological Society of London]] in 1931 which today (2014) covers 600 acres (2.4&amp;nbsp;km²). Since the early 1970s, an 1,800 acre (7&amp;nbsp;km²) park in the San Pasqual Valley near San Diego has featured the [[San Diego Zoo Safari Park]], run by the Zoological Society of San Diego. One of two state-supported zoo parks in North Carolina is the {{convert|2000|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[North Carolina Zoo]] in Asheboro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ferral |first=Katelyn |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2010/07/15/582114/nc-zoo-bucking-a-trend-sets-an.html |title=N.C.

=== Aquaria ===
{{further|Public aquarium}}
[[File:Seals@melb zoo.jpg|thumb|right|Sea lions at the [[Melbourne Zoo]]]]

The first [[public aquarium]] was opened at the London Zoo in 1853. This was followed by the opening of public aquaria in continental Europe (e.g. Paris in 1859, Hamburg in 1864, Berlin in 1869, and Brighton in 1872) and the United States (e.g. Boston in 1859, Washington in 1873, San Francisco Woodward's Garden in 1873, and the New York Aquarium at [[Battery Park]] in 1896).

=== Roadside zoos ===
Roadside zoos are found throughout [[North America]], particularly in remote locations. They are often small, for-profit zoos, often intended to attract visitors to some other facility, such as a gas station. The animals may be trained to perform tricks, and visitors are able to get closer to them than in larger zoos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theguzoo.com/main_page.html Guzoo Animal Farm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510051708/http://www.theguzoo.com/main_page.html |date=May 10, 2008 }}, website about Canadian roadside zoos, accessed June 18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Since they are sometimes less regulated, roadside zoos are often subject to accusations of [[neglect]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KeoyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0AcGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2373,1804633&amp;dq=roadside-zoo&amp;hl=en Roadside zoo animals starving.] ''Free Lance-Star.'' 11 Jan. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cruelty to animals|cruelty]].&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, Jennifer.

In June 2014 the [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]] filed a lawsuit against the Iowa-based roadside Cricket Hollow Zoo for violating the Endangered Species Act by failing to provide proper care for its animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aldf.org/press-room/press-releases/animal-legal-defense-fund-sues-iowa-zoo-over-endangered-species-act-violations/Animal|title=Animal Abandonment is a Crime - Animal Legal Defense Fund|date=8 April 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since filing the lawsuit, ALDF has obtained records from investigations conducted by the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Services; these records show that the zoo is also violating the Animal Welfare Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/237127240/USDA-APHIS-Inspection-Report-of-Cricket-Hollow-Zoo-May-21-2014/USDA|title=- APHIS Inspection Report of Cricket Hollow Zoo, May 21 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Petting zoos ===
{{main article|Petting zoo}}

A petting zoo, also called petting farms or children's zoos, features a combination of [[domestic animal]]s and wild species that are docile enough to touch and feed. To ensure the animals' health, the food is supplied by the zoo, either from vending machines or a kiosk nearby.

=== Animal theme parks ===
{{main article|Animal theme park}}

An animal theme park is a combination of an [[amusement park]] and a zoo, mainly for entertaining and commercial purposes. [[Marine mammal park]]s such as [[SeaWorld|Sea World]] and [[Marineland of Florida|Marineland]] are more elaborate [[dolphinarium]]s keeping [[whale]]s, and containing additional entertainment attractions. Another kind of animal theme park contains more entertainment and amusement elements than the classical zoo, such as a stage shows, roller coasters, and mythical creatures. Some examples are [[Busch Gardens Tampa Bay]] in [[Tampa, Florida]], [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] and [[Gatorland]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], [[Flamingo Land]] in [[North Yorkshire, England]], and [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] in [[Vallejo, California]].

== Sources of animals ==
By the year 2000 most animals being displayed in zoos were the offspring of other zoo animals.  This trend, however was and still is somewhat species-specific. When animals are transferred between zoos, they usually spend time in quarantine, and are given time to acclimatize to their new enclosures which are often designed to mimic their natural environment. For example, some species of penguins may require refrigerated enclosures. Guidelines on necessary care for such animals is published in the ''International Zoo Yearbook''.&lt;ref name=EBProcurement&gt;"Zoo: Procurement and care of animals," ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Justification ==

=== Conservation and research ===
[[File:NCZooelephants.jpg|thumb|right|The African plains exhibit at [[North Carolina Zoo]] illustrates the dimension of an open-range zoo.]]

The position of most modern zoos in [[Australasia]], Asia, Europe, and North America, particularly those with scientific societies, is that they display wild animals primarily for the [[conservation biology|conservation]] of endangered [[species]], as well as for [[Animal testing|research purposes]] and education, and secondarily for the entertainment of visitors,&lt;ref&gt;Tudge, Colin. ''Last Animals in the Zoo: How Mass Extinction Can Be Stopped'', London 1991. {{ISBN|1-55963-157-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biaza.org.uk/resources/library/images/MANIFESTO.pdf "Manifesto for Zoos"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823075916/http://www.biaza.org.uk/resources/library/images/MANIFESTO.pdf |date=August 23, 2006 }}, John Regan Associates, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; an argument disputed by critics. The Zoological Society of London states in its charter that its aim is "the advancement of Zoology and Animal Physiology and the introduction of new and curious subjects of the Animal Kingdom." It maintains two research institutes, the Nuffield Institute of Comparative Medicine and the Wellcome Institute of Comparative Physiology. In the U.S., the Penrose Research Laboratory of the Philadelphia Zoo focuses on the study of comparative [[pathology]].&lt;ref name=EBZoo/&gt; The World Association of Zoos and Aquariums produced its first conservation strategy in 1993, and in November 2004, it adopted a new strategy that sets out the aims and mission of zoological gardens of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waza.org/conservation/wzacs.php "World Zoo and Aquarium Conservation Strategy"], World Association of Zoos and Aquariums.&lt;/ref&gt;

The breeding of endangered species is coordinated by cooperative breeding programmes containing international studbooks and coordinators, who evaluate the roles of individual animals and institutions from a global or regional perspective, and there are regional programmes all over the world for the conservation of [[endangered species]].&lt;ref&gt;In Africa, conservation is handled by the African Preservation Program APP (African Association of Zoological Gardens and Aquaria; in the U.S. and Canada by Species Survival Plans ([http://www.aza.org/ American Zoo and Aquarium Association]), and the [http://www.caza.ca/ Canadian Association of Zoos and Aquariums]); in Australasia, by the Australasian Species Management Program ([http://www.arazpa.org.au/ASMP_Committee.htm Australasian Regional Association of Zoological Parks and Aquaria] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202150900/http://arazpa.org.au/ASMP_Committee.htm |date=2007-02-02 }}); in Europe, by the European Endangered Species Program ([http://www.eaza.net/ European Association of Zoos and Aquaria]); and in Japan, South Asia, and South East Asia, by the Japanese Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the South Asian Zoo Association for Regional Cooperation, and the South East Asian Zoo Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides conservation of captive species, large zoos may form a suitable environment for wild native animals such as [[heron]]s to live in or visit. A colony of [[black-crowned night heron]]s has regularly summered at the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] for more than a century.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian's mystery of the black-crowned night herons solved by satellites"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Akpan|first1=Nsikan|title=Smithsonian's mystery of the black-crowned night herons solved by satellites|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/sciencescope-smithsonians-mystery-black-crowned-night-herons-solved-satellites/|website=PBS News Hour|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some zoos may provide information to visitors on wild animals visiting or living in the zoo, or encourage them by directing them to specific feeding or breeding platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Birdworld Animals|url=http://birdworld.co.uk/animals/|website=Birdworld|accessdate=21 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tiergarten&gt;{{cite web |title=Graureiher |url=https://www.zoovienna.at/tiere/voegel/graureiher/ |publisher=Tiergarten Schoenbrunn |accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Roadside zoos ==
In modern, well-regulated zoos, breeding is controlled to maintain a self-sustaining, global captive population.  This is not the case in some less well-regulated zoos, often based in poorer regions. Overall "stock turnover" of animals during a year in a select group of poor zoos was reported as 20%-25% with 75% of wild caught apes dying in captivity within the first 20 months.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Derrick and Tweedy-Holmes Karen. ''Thought to exist in the wild: awakening from the nightmare of zoos''. No Voice Unheard, 2007, p. 21; Baratay, Eric and Hardouin-Fugier, Elisabeth. ''Zoo: A History of the Zoological Gardens of the West''. Reaktion, London. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the report stated that before successful breeding programs, the high mortality rate was the reason for the "massive scale of importations."

One 2-year study indicated that of 19,361 mammals that left accredited zoos in the U.S. between 1992 and 1998, 7,420 (38%) went to dealers, auctions, hunting ranches, unaccredited zoos and individuals, and game farms.&lt;ref&gt;Goldston, Linda. February 11, 1999, cited in Scully, Matthew. ''Dominion''. St. Martin's Griffin, 2004 (paperback), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animal welfare concerns ==
{{further information|Captivity (animal)|Behavioral enrichment}}
[[File:Dalian zoo bear cages, 1997.jpg|right|thumb|Bear cages, one square meter in size, in Dalian zoo, Port Arthur, Liaoning Province, China, in 1997]]

The welfare of zoo animals varies widely. Many zoos work to improve their animal enclosures and make it fit the animals' needs, although constraints such as size and expense make it difficult to create ideal captive environments for many species.&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Bryan G.; Hutchins, Michael; Stevens, Elizabeth F.; Maple, Terry L. (ed.): ''Ethics on the Ark. Zoos, Animal Welfare, and Wildlife Conservation''. Washington, D.C., 1995. {{ISBN|1-56098-515-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malmud, Randy. ''Reading Zoos. Representations of Animals and Captivity''. New York, 1998. {{ISBN|0-8147-5602-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study examining data collected over four decades found that [[polar bear]]s, lions, tigers and [[cheetah]]s show evidence of stress in captivity.&lt;ref name=MarkNYT2003&gt;Derr, Mark. "Big Beasts, Tight Space and a Call for Change in Journal Report," ''The New York Times'', October 2, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Zoos can be internment camps for animals, but also a place of refuge. A zoo can be considered an internment camp due to the insufficient enclosures that the animals have to live in.  When an elephant is placed in a pen that is flat, has no tree, no other elephants and only a few plastic toys to play with; it can lead to boredom and foot problems (Lemonic, McDowel, and Bjerklie 50). Also, animals can have a shorter life span when they are in these types of enclosures. Causes can be human diseases, materials in the cages, and possible escape attempts (Bendow 382).  However, when zoos take time to think about the animal's welfare, zoos can become a place of refuge. There are animals that are injured in the wild and are unable to survive on their own, but in the zoos they can live out the rest of their lives healthy and happy (McGaffin). In recent years, some zoos have chosen to stop showing their larger animals because they are simply unable to provide an adequate enclosure for them (Lemonic, McDowell, and Bjerklie 50).

=== Moral concerns ===
Some critics and many animal rights activists argue that zoo animals are treated as voyeuristic objects, rather than living creatures, and often suffer due to the transition from being free and wild to captivity.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last 2 decades, European and North-American zoos, strongly depend on breeding within zoos, while decreasing the number of wild caught animals.{{Clarify|date=September 2015}}

=== Behavioural restriction ===
Many modern zoos attempt to improve animal welfare by providing more space and [[behavioural enrichment]]s.  This often involves housing the animals in naturalistic enclosures that allow the animals to express some of their natural behaviours, such as roaming and foraging. However, many animals remain in barren concrete enclosures or other minimally enriched cages.&lt;ref name=Masci2000&gt;{{cite journal|author=Masci, D.|title=Zoos in the 21st century.|journal=CQ Researcher|year=2000|pages=353–76|url=http://www.cqpress.com/product/Researcher-Zoos-in-the-21st-Century.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals which naturally range over many km each day, or make seasonal migrations, are unable to perform these behaviors in zoo enclosures. For example, elephants usually travel approximately {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} each day.&lt;ref name="Are zoos good"&gt;{{cite web|title=Are Zoos good or bad for animals?|url=http://animal.discovery.com/animal-facts/zoos-good-or-bad.htm|accessdate=28 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030041017/http://animal.discovery.com/animal-facts/zoos-good-or-bad.htm|archive-date=30 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Abnormal behaviour ===
{{further information|List of abnormal behaviours in animals}}

Animals in zoos often exhibit behaviors that are abnormal in their frequency, intensity, or would not normally be part of their [[Ethogram|behavioural repertoire]]. These are usually indicative of stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Perspective On Zoos |url=https://www.theperspective.com/debates/living/the-perspective-on-zoos/ |publisher=The Perspective |date=27 September 2017 |accessdate=31 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, elephants sometimes perform head-bobbing, bears sometimes pace repeatedly around the limits of their enclosure, wild cats sometimes groom themselves obsessively, and birds pluck out their own feathers.&lt;ref name="Are zoos good" /&gt; Some critics of zoos claim that the animals are always under physical and mental stress, regardless of the quality of care towards the animals.&lt;ref name=Sterm2005&gt;{{cite web|author=Sterm, A.|date=28 February 2005|title=Elephant deaths at zoos reignite animal debate: Zoo supporters cite conservation, activists cite confined spaces|publisher=MSNBC/Reuters|url=http://www.elephants.com/media/MSNBC_2_28_05.htm|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants have been recorded displaying [[Stereotypy (non-human)|stereotypical behaviours]] in the form of swaying back and forth, trunk swaying or route tracing. This has been observed in 54% of individuals in UK zoos.&lt;ref name=Harrisetal.2008&gt;{{cite web|author1=Harris, M. |author2=Sherwin, C. |author3=Harris, S. |url=http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=WC05007_7719_FRP.pdf|title=Defra Final Report on Elephant Welfare|publisher=University of Bristol|date=10 November 2008|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shortened longevity ===
Elephants in Japanese zoos have shorter lifespans than their wild counterparts at only 17 years, although other studies suggest that zoo elephants live as long as those in the wild.&lt;ref name=Mott2008&gt;{{cite web|author=Mott, M.|date=11 December 2008|title=Wild elephants live longer than their zoo counterparts|publisher=National Geographic News|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/12/081211-zoo-elephants.html|accessdate=24 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, many other animals, such as reptiles, can live much longer than they would in the wild.

=== Climate concerns ===
Climatic conditions can make it difficult to keep some animals in zoos in some locations. For example, [[Alaska Zoo]] had an elephant named Maggie. She was housed in a small, indoor enclosure because the outdoor temperature was too low.&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune 2016"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kershaw|first1=Sarah|title=Alaska's lone zoo elephant heats up national debate|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-01-10/news/0501100102_1_elephant-experts-alaska-zoo-asian-elephant|accessdate=23 January 2016|agency=Chicago Tribune|date=10 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NBC2007&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pemberton|first1=Mary|title=Alaska's only elephant heads to California|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21587690/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/alaskas-only-elephant-heads-california/#.VqLQkVN95Fw|accessdate=23 January 2016|agency=NBC|date=11 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surplus animals ==
Especially in large animals, a limited number of spaces are available in zoos. As a consequence, various management tools are used to preserve the space for the most "valuable" individuals and reduce the risk of [[inbreeding]]. Management of animal populations is typically through international organizations such as [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums|AZA]] and [[EAZA]].&lt;ref name=PQA/&gt; Zoos have several different ways of managing the animal populations, such as moves between zoos, [[Wildlife contraceptive|contraception]], sale of excess animals and euthanization (culling).&lt;ref name=WMC/&gt;

Contraception can be effective, but may also have health repercussions and can be difficult (or even impossible) to reverse in some animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What happens when zoo contraceptives work too well?|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/what-happens-when-zoo-contraceptives-work-too-well/article_8e71a4c4-2cd1-58d7-b8af-8fe8eb1be30c.html|publisher=St. Louis Dispatch|author=Hunn, D.|date=February 16, 2014|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, some species may lose their reproductive capability entirely if prevented from breeding for a period (whether through contraceptives or isolation), but further study is needed on the subject.&lt;ref name=PQA&gt;{{cite journal|title=Population Q&amp;A|journal=Zooquaria|publisher=EAZA|volume=Autumn 2016|issue=94|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sale of surplus animals from zoos was once common and in some cases animals have ended up in substandard facilities. In recent decades the practice of selling animals from certified zoos has declined.&lt;ref name=WMC&gt;{{cite book|title=Wild Mammals in Captivity|year=2010|author=Kleiman, Thompson and Baer|pages=265–266|isbn=978-0-226-44009-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of animals are culled each year in zoos, but this is controversial.&lt;ref name=HPMG&gt;{{cite web|title=Marius The Giraffe Was Not Alone: Zoos in Europe Kill 5,000 Healthy Animals Annually|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/02/27/marius-giraffe-zoos-cull_n_4865542.html|publisher=Huffington Post|date=February 27, 2014|accessdate=November 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A highly publicized culling as part of population management was that of [[Marius (giraffe)|a healthy giraffe]] at Copenhagen Zoo in 2014.

There were offers to adopt it and an online petition to save it had many thousand signatories, but the culling proceeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Copenhagen Zoo kills 'surplus' young giraffe Marius despite online petition.|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/copenhagen-zoo-kills-surplus-young-giraffe-marius-despite-online-petition-9117317.html|publisher=The Independent|author=Johnston, I.|date=February 9, 2014|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although zoos in some countries have been open about culling, the controversy of the subject and pressure from the public has resulted in others being closed.&lt;ref name=WMC/&gt; This stands in contrast to most zoos publicly announcing animal births.&lt;ref name=WMC/&gt; Furthermore, while many zoos are willing to cull smaller and/or low-profile animals, fewer are willing to do it with larger high-profile species.&lt;ref name=WMC/&gt;&lt;ref name=HPMG/&gt;

== Live feeding and "baiting" ==

In many countries, feeding live vertebrates to zoo animals is illegal, except in exceptional circumstances.{{cn|date=August 2017}}  For example, some snakes refuse to eat dead prey. However, in the Badaltearing Safari Park in [[China]], visitors can throw live goats into the lion enclosure and watch them being eaten, or can purchase live [[chicken]]s tied to [[bamboo]] rods for the equivalent of 2 [[dollars]]/[[euros]] to dangle into lion pens.  Visitors can drive through the lion compound in buses with specially designed chutes which they can use to push live chickens into the enclosure. In the Xiongsen Bear and Tiger Mountain Village near Guilin in south-east China, live cows and pigs are thrown to tigers to amuse visitors.&lt;ref name=Penman&gt;{{cite news|author=Penman, D|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-506153/Animals-torn-pieces-lions-baying-crowds-spectator-sport-China-DOESNT-want-see.html|title=Animals torn to pieces by lions in front of baying crowds: The spectator sport China DOESN'T want you to see.|publisher=The Daily Mail|date=January 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lairweb1999&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lairweb.org.nz/tiger/release7.html|title=Ferocity training|publisher=Sunday Morning Post, Hong Kong|date=November 29, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Qingdao zoo (Eastern China), visitors can engage in "tortoise baiting", where tortoises are kept inside small rooms with elastic bands around their necks so that they are unable to retract their heads. Visitors are allowed to throw coins at them. The marketing claim is that if a person hits one of the tortoises on the head and makes a wish, it will be fulfilled.&lt;ref name=Penman/&gt;

=== United States ===
In the United States, any public animal exhibit must be licensed and inspected by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]]. Depending on the animals they exhibit, the activities of zoos are regulated by laws including the [[Endangered Species Act]], the [[Animal Welfare Act of 1966|Animal Welfare Act]], the [[Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918]] and others.&lt;ref  name=Grech&gt;Grech, Kali S. [http://www.animallaw.info/articles/ovuszoos.htm "Overview of the Laws Affecting Zoos"], Michigan State University College of Law, Animal Legal &amp; Historical Center, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, zoos in North America may choose to pursue accreditation by the [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (AZA). To achieve accreditation, a zoo must pass an application and inspection process and meet or exceed the AZA's standards for animal health and welfare, fundraising, zoo staffing, and involvement in global conservation efforts. Inspection is performed by three experts (typically one veterinarian, one expert in animal care, and one expert in zoo management and operations) and then reviewed by a panel of twelve experts before accreditation is awarded. This accreditation process is repeated once every five years. The AZA estimates that there are approximately 2,400 animal exhibits operating under USDA license as of February 2007; fewer than 10% are accredited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aza.org/Accreditation/AccreditationIntro/ AZA Accreditation Introduction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102132956/http://www.aza.org/Accreditation/AccreditationIntro/ |date=November 2, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Europe ===
In April 1999, the [[European Union]] introduced a directive to strengthen the conservation role of zoos, making it a statutory requirement that they participate in conservation and education, and requiring all member states to set up systems for their licensing and inspection.&lt;ref name=Defra/&gt; Zoos are regulated in the UK by the Zoo Licensing Act of 1981, which came into effect in 1984. A zoo is defined as any "establishment where wild animals are kept for exhibition ... to which members of the public have access, with or without charge for admission, seven or more days in any period of twelve consecutive months", excluding circuses and pet shops. The Act requires that all zoos be inspected and licensed, and that animals kept in enclosures are provided with a suitable environment in which they can express most normal behavior.&lt;ref name=Defra&gt;[http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/gwd/zoo.htm "The Zoo Licensing Act 1981"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504172909/http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/gwd/zoo.htm |date=May 4, 2008 }}, Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;
