The '''American Association of Individual Investors''' is a nonprofit organization with about 150,000 members&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/bow/b2c/review.jhtml?id=190|title=Forbes.com Best of the Web - AAII|author=Forbes.com|work=Forbes.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204094757/http://www.forbes.com/bow/b2c/review.jhtml?id=190 |archivedate=February 4, 2012 |accessdate=2014-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whose purpose is to educate individual investors regarding stock market portfolios, financial planning, and retirement accounts.&lt;ref name="AAII"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaii.com/aboutaaii/|title=About AAII|author=James Cloonan, PhD|work=AAII Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AAII "assists individuals in becoming effective managers of their own assets through programs of education, information and research." &lt;ref name="BBB"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbb.org/chicago/business-reviews/professional-services-general/american-association-of-individual-investors-in-chicago-il-1911#products
|title=BBB Review of American Association of Individual Investors|author=Better Business Bureau|work=BBB.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization markets itself as an unbiased source of investment information because of its not-for-profit status.

The organization was founded in 1978 by James Cloonan, Ph.D. Over the last thirty years, AAII's members report "investment returns that are consistently higher than those of the stock market as a whole" &lt;ref name="AAII" /&gt; (using the [[S&amp;P 500]] as reference).  Since 2003, AAII has maintained two real portfolios—a [[shadow stock]] portfolio and a mutual fund portfolio – for education purposes.  These portfolios' returns and contents are available online and, the site reports, have outperformed the market considerably over the course of their existence.&lt;ref name="AAII Portfolio Page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaii.com/aaiiportfolios/|title=Introduction to Model Portfolios|author=AAII.com|work=AAII Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
AAII.com is the organization's main outlet for their educational materials.  While it does offer some completely free information, requiring no registration or membership dues, a large portion of the site requires free registration or membership.  AAII's best and premium content is made available only to members, who pay fees starting at $29 a year.  For this fee, they receive the ''AAII Journal'' (the organization's monthly ad-free magazine), access to the organization's model portfolios, techniques for screening stocks, free investment courses, and other benefits.&lt;ref name="JoinAAII_page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aaii.com/benefits/joinaaii/|work=AAII Website|title=Join AAII|author=AAII.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For members interested in using their computers as an investment resource, AAII offers the ''Computerized Investing'' journal and [[microsite]] for an additional annual fee.&lt;ref name="JoinAAII_page" /&gt;

'''Applied behavior analysis''' ('''ABA''') is a scientific discipline concerned with applying techniques based upon the principles of learning to change behavior of social significance.&lt;ref name=JABA3&gt;{{cite journal|author=Baer, D.M.|author2=Wolf, M.M.|author3=Risley, T.R.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Some current dimensions of applied behavior analysis|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1968|volume=1|pages=91–97|pmid=16795165|pmc=1310980|issue=1|doi=10.1901/jaba.1968.1-91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="applied_behavioral_strategies"&gt;See also footnote number "(1)" of [and the whole "What is ABA?" section of] «{{cite web

The name "applied behavior analysis" has replaced [[behavior modification]] because the latter approach suggested attempting to change behavior without clarifying the relevant behavior-environment interactions. In contrast, ABA tries to change behavior by first [[Functional analysis (psychology)|assessing the functional relationship between a targeted behavior and the environment]].&lt;ref name=JABA/&gt; Further, the approach often seeks to develop socially acceptable alternatives for aberrant behaviors.&lt;ref name=JABA&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mace, F.C.|title=The significance and future of functional analysis methodologies|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1994|volume=27|pages=385–392|doi=10.1901/jaba.1994.27-385|pmc=1297814|issue=2|pmid=16795830}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JABA2&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Baer, D.M.|author2= Wolf, M.M.|author3= Risley, T.R.|lastauthoramp=y|title=Some still-current dimensions of applied behavior analysis|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1987|volume=20|issue=4|pages=313–327|doi=10.1901/jaba.1987.20-313|pmc=1286071|pmid=16795703}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JEAB&gt;{{cite journal|author1=F.C.

==Definition==
ABA is an applied science devoted to developing procedures which will produce observable changes in behavior.&lt;ref name=JABA3/&gt; It is to be distinguished from the [[experimental analysis of behavior]], which focuses on basic experimental research,&lt;ref name=As-in-ABA&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dillenburger, K. |author2=Keenan, M. |title=None of the As in ABA stand for autism: dispelling the myths |journal=J Intellect Dev Disabil |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=193–95 |year=2009 |pmid=19404840 |doi=10.1080/13668250902845244}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it uses principles developed by such research, in particular [[operant conditioning]] and [[classical conditioning]]. Behavior analysis adopts the viewpoint of [[radical behaviorism]], treating thoughts, emotions, and other covert activity as behavior that is subject to the same rules as overt responses. This represents a shift away from methodological behaviorism, which restricts behavior-change procedures to behaviors that are overt, and was the conceptual underpinning of [[behavior modification]].

Behavior analysts also emphasize that the science of behavior must be a ''natural'' science as opposed to a ''social'' science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marr |first1=M |title=The natural selection: behavior analysis as a natural science |journal=European Journal of Behavior Analysis |date=2009 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=103–118 |url=http://www.ejoba.org/PDF/2009_2/Marr_2009.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129034739/http://www.ejoba.org/PDF/2009_2/Marr_2009.pdf |archivedate=29 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, behavior analysts focus on the observable relationship of behavior with the environment, including [[antecedent (behavioral psychology)|antecedents]] and consequences, without resort to [[Subfields of psychology|"hypothetical constructs"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Thompson, T. |doi=10.1901/jeab.1984.41-211 |pmc=1348034 |year=1984 |title=The examining magistrate for nature: a retrospective review of Claude Bernard's An Introduction to the Study of Experimental Medicine |journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior |volume=2 |issue=41 |pages=212–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginnings of ABA can be traced back to the research of Teodoro Ayllon and [[Jack Michael]] with their study "The psychiatric nurse as a behavioral engineer" (1959) that they submitted to the ''[[Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior]]'' (JEAB) as part of their doctoral dissertation at the [[University of Houston]]. The researchers were training the staff and nurses at a [[psychiatric hospital]] how to use a [[token economy]] based on the principles of [[operant conditioning]] and [[behavioral engineering]]&amp;mdash;a synonym for ABA,&lt;ref name=behavioranalysislearning&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This paper later led to the founding of the ''[[Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis]]'' (JABA), which publishes research in the application of behavior analysis to a wide array of socially relevant behavior,&lt;ref name=lovaas&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3089401/|vauthors=Larsson EV, Wright S|title=O.

&lt;/ref&gt; such as autism, pediatric feeding therapy, substance-use disorders, and classroom instruction with typically developing students.

A group of faculty and researchers at the [[University of Washington]], including [[Donald M. Baer|Donald Baer]], [[Sidney W. Bijou]], Bill Hopkins, Jay Birnbrauer, Todd Risley, and [[Montrose Wolf]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lovitt|first1=Thomas C.|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1993|volume=26|issue=4|pages=563–567|doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-563|pmid=16795814|pmc=1297893|title=A brief history of applied behavior analysis at the University of Washington}}&lt;/ref&gt; applied the principles of behavior analysis to instruct developmentally disabled children, provide behavior management strategies in juvenile detention centers, and [[organizational behavior management|organize employees who required proper structure and management in businesses]], amongst other situations. In 1968, Baer, Bijou, Risley, Birnbrauer, Wolf, and James Sherman joined the Department of Human Development and Family Life at the [[University of Kansas]], where they founded the ''Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis''.&lt;ref name=HistoryofJABAResearchFaculty&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baer|first1=Donald M.|journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis|date=1993|volume=26|issue=4|pages=569–570|doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-569|pmid=16795815|pmc=1297894|title=A brief, selective history of the Department of Human Development and Family Life at the University of Kansas: The early years}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable graduate students from the University of Washington include Robert Wahler, James Sherman, and [[Ivar Lovaas]].&lt;ref name=lovaas/&gt;&lt;ref name=HistoryofJABAResearchFaculty/&gt; Lovaas established the UCLA Young Autism Project while teaching at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], and devoted nearly half a century to groundbreaking research and practice aimed at improving the lives of children with autism and their families. In 1965, Lovaas published a series of articles that outlined his system for coding observed behaviors, described a pioneering investigation of the antecedents and consequences that maintained a problem behavior,&lt;ref name="Lovaas"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=T|author2=Eikseth|title=S|journal=Journal of Autism &amp; Developmental Disorders|date=14 December 2010|volume=41|issue=3|pages=375–378|doi=10.1007/s10803-010-1162-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and relied upon the methods of [[errorless learning]] that was initially devised by [[Charles Ferster]] to teach nonverbal children to speak. Lovaas also described how to use social (secondary) reinforcers, teach children to imitate, and what interventions (including electric shocks) may be used to reduce aggression and life-threatening self-injury.&lt;ref name="Lovaas"/&gt; 

In 1987, Lovaas published the landmark study, "Behavioral Treatment and Normal Educational and Intellectual Functioning in Young Autistic Children".&lt;ref name=lovaas/&gt; The experimental group in this study received up to 40-hours per week in a 1:1 teaching setting using errorless [[discrete trial training]] (DTT). The treatment is done at home with parents involved in every aspect of treatment, and the curriculum is highly individualized with a heavy emphasis on teaching eye contact and language. ABA principles are used to motivate learning and reduce non-desired behaviors. The outcome of this study indicated 47% of the experimental group (9/19) went on to lose their autism diagnosis and were described as indistinguishable from their typical adolescent peers. This included passing regular education without assistance, making and maintaining friends, and becoming self-sufficient as adults. These gains were maintained as reported in the 1993 study, "Long-Term Outcome for Children With Autism Who Received Early Intensive Behavioral Treatment". Lovaas’ work went on to be recognized by the US Surgeon General in 1999, and his research outcomes were replicated in university and private settings. The "Lovaas Method" went on to become known as early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), or DTT for 30 to 40 hours per week. 

In addition to being a major contributor of ABA, Lovaas taught now prominent behaviorists, such as [[Robert Koegel]], Laura Schreibman, Tristram Smith, John McEachin, Ron Leaf, [[Doreen Granpeesheh]], Jacquie Wynn, and over 20,000 UCLA students who took his "Behavior Modification" course during his 50 years of teaching. He even cofounded what is today the [[Autism Society of America]] (ASA), published hundreds of research articles and books, received state and national awards, and forced school districts to adopt evidenced based teaching programs. His work influenced how autism was treated, and improved the lives of parents and children stricken with the autism diagnosis worldwide.

Over the years, "behavior analysis" gradually superseded "behavior modification";  that is, from simply trying to alter problematic behavior, behavior analysts sought to understand the function of that behavior, what antecedents promote and maintain it, and how it can be replaced by successful behavior.&lt;ref name=JEAB/&gt; This analysis is based on careful initial assessment of a behavior's function and a testing of methods that produce changes in behavior.

While ABA seems to be intrinsically linked to autism intervention, it is also used for [[applied animal behavior]] and [[clinical behavior analysis]], in [[behavioral medicine]], [[behavioral neuroscience]], and [[criminology]], to [[Organizational behavior management|increase job safety and performance]], [[Systematic desensitization|counteract phobias]], and [[Positive behavior support|improve classroom management]].&lt;ref name=PBSExpansion&gt;{{cite journal|title=Positive behavior support: Expanding the application of applied behavior analysis.|last1=Anderson|first1=CM|last2=Freeman|first2=KA|journal=The Behavior Analyst|volume=23|issue=1|pages=85–94|pmc=2731369|date=Spring 2000|pmid=22478340}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abapbsschoolviolence&gt;{{cite journal|title=Applying behavior analysis to school violence and discipline problems|last1=Anderson|first1=CM|last2=Kincald|first2=D|journal=The Behavior Analyst|volume=28|issue=1|pages=49–63|pmc=2755344|year=2005|pmid=22478439}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SWPBIS&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=schoolwide+positive+behavioral+interventions+%26+supports|title=The impact of schoolwide positive behavioral interventions and supports on bullying and peer rejection: a randomized controlled effectiveness trial|last1=Waasdorp|first1=TE|last2=Bradshaw|first2=CP|last3=Leaf|first3=PJ|journal=Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine|volume=166|issue=2|pages=149–56|date=Winter 2012|doi=10.1001/archpediatrics.2011.755|pmid=22312173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==

Baer, Wolf, and Risley's 1968 article&lt;ref name=BWR/&gt; is still used as the standard description of ABA.&lt;ref name=CooperHeron2007&gt;{{cite book |ref = harvnb |author1=Cooper, J.O. |author2=Heron, T.E. |author3=Heward, W.L. |title=Applied Behavior Analysis |url =http://wps.prenhall.com/chet_cooper_appliedbeh_2 |edition=2nd |year=2007 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-142113-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lists the following the seven characteristics of ABA.
* '''Applied''':  ABA focuses on the social significance of the behavior studied. For example, a non-applied researcher may study eating behavior because this research helps to clarify metabolic processes, whereas the applied researcher may study eating behavior in individuals who eat too little or too much, trying to change such behavior so that it is more acceptable to the persons involved.
* '''Behavioral''':  ABA is pragmatic; it asks how it is possible to get an individual to do something effectively. To answer this question, the behavior itself must be objectively measured. Verbal descriptions are treated as behavior in themselves, and not as substitutes for the behavior described.
* '''Analytic''':  Behavior analysis is successful when the analyst understands and can manipulate the events that control a target behavior. This may be relatively easy to do in the lab, where a researcher is able to arrange the relevant events, but it is not always easy, or ethical, in an applied situation.&lt;ref name=BWR&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Baer, D.M. |author2=Wolf, M.M. |author3=Risley, T.R. |year=1968 |title=Some current dimensions of applied behavior analysis |journal=J Appl Behav Anal |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages= 91–97 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1968.1-91 |pmc=1310980 |pmid=16795165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baer et al. outline two methods that may be used in applied settings to demonstrate control while maintaining ethical standards. These are the reversal design and the multiple baseline design. In the reversal design, the experimenter first measures the behavior of choice, introduces an intervention, and then measures the behavior again. Then, the intervention is removed, or reduced, and the behavior is measured yet again. The intervention is effective to the extent that the behavior changes and then changes back in response to these manipulations.  The multiple baseline method may be used for behaviors that seem irreversible. Here, several behaviors are measured and then the intervention is applied to each in turn. The effectiveness of the intervention is revealed by changes in just the behavior to which the intervention is being applied. 
* '''Technological''':  The description of analytic research must be clear and detailed, so that any competent researcher can repeat it accurately.&lt;ref name=BWR/&gt;  Cooper et al. describe a good way to check this: Have a person trained in applied behavior analysis read the description and then act out the procedure in detail. If the person makes any mistakes or has to ask any questions then the description needs improvement.&lt;ref name=CooperHeron2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Conceptually Systematic''':  Behavior analysis should not simply produce a list of effective interventions.  Rather, to the extent possible, these methods should be grounded in behavioral principles. This is aided by the use of theoretically meaningful terms, such as "secondary reinforcement" or "errorless discrimination" where appropriate.
* '''Effective''':  Though analytic methods should be theoretically grounded, they must be effective. If an intervention does not produce a large enough effect for practical use, then the analysis has failed
* '''General''':  Behavior analysts should aim for interventions that are generally applicable; the methods should work in different environments, apply to more than one specific behavior, and have long-lasting effects.

===Other proposed characteristics===

In 2005, Heward et al. suggested that the following five characteristics should be added:&lt;ref name=Heward&gt;{{cite book |editor=Heward, W.L. |year=2005 |title=Focus on behavior analysis in education: Achievements, challenges, and opportunities |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |publisher=Prentice Hall/Merrill |isbn=0-13-111339-9|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Accountable''': To be accountable means that ABA must be able to demonstrate that its methods are effective. This requires the repeatedly measuring the success of interventions, and, if necessary, making changes that improve their effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Stokes, Trevor |author2=Budd, Karen S. |title=A small matter of proof: the legacy of Donald M. Baer |publisher=Context Press |location=Reno, NV |year=2003 |isbn=1-878978-43-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Public''': The methods, results, and theoretical analyses of ABA must be published and open to scrutiny. There are no hidden treatments or mystical, metaphysical explanations.
* '''Doable''': To be generally useful, interventions should be available to a variety of individuals, who might be teachers, parents, therapists, or even those who wish to modify their own behavior. With proper planning and training, many interventions can be applied by almost anyone willing to invest the effort.&lt;ref name=Heward1&gt;Heward, 205 p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Empowering''': ABA provides tools that give the practitioner feedback on the results of interventions. These allow clinicians to assess their skill level and build confidence in their effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Optimistic''': According to several leading authors, behavior analysts have cause to be optimistic that their efforts are socially worthwhile, for the following reasons:
** The behaviors impacted by behavior analysis are largely determined by learning and controlled by manipulable aspects of the environment.
** Practitioners can improve performance by direct and continuous measurements.
** As a practitioner uses behavioral techniques with positive outcomes, they become more confident of future success.
** The literature provides many examples of success in teaching individuals considered previously unteachable.

==Concepts==

===Behavior===
{{Main article|Behavior}}

Behavior refers to the movement of some part of an organism that changes some aspect of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnston |first=James M. |lastauthoramp=y |last2=Pennypacker |first2=H.S. |year=1993a |title=Strategies and tactics of behavioral research |location=Hillsdale, NJ |publisher=Erlbaum Associates |page=23 |isbn=0-8058-0905-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the term behavior refers to a class of responses that share physical dimensions or functions, and in that case a ''response'' is a single instance of that behavior.&lt;ref name=CooperHeron2007/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a group of responses have the same function, this group may be called a response class. "Repertoire" refers to the various responses available to an individual; the term may refer to responses that are relevant to a particular situation, or it may refer to everything a person can do.

====Operant conditioning====
{{Main article|Operant conditioning}}

Operant behavior is the so-called "voluntary" behavior that is sensitive to, or controlled by its consequences. Specifically, operant conditioning refers to the [[three-term contingency]] that uses [[stimulus control]], in particular an antecedent contingency called the discriminative stimulus (SD) that influences the strengthening or weakening of behavior through such consequences as [[reinforcement]] or [[punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used quite generally, from reaching for a candy bar, to turning up the heat to escape an aversive chill, to studying for an exam to get good grades.

====Respondent (classical) conditioning====
{{Main article|Classical conditioning}}

Respondent (classical) conditioning is based on innate stimulus-response relationships called reflexes. In his famous experiments with dogs, Pavlov usually used the salivary reflex, namely salivation (unconditioned response) following the taste of food (unconditioned stimulus). Pairing a neutral stimulus, for example a bell (conditioned stimulus) with food caused the bell to elicit salivation (conditioned response). Thus, in classical conditioning, the conditioned stimulus becomes a signal for a biologically significant consequence. Note that in respondent conditioning, unlike operant conditioning, the response does not ''produce'' a reinforcer or punisher (e.g. the dog does not get food ''because'' it salivates).

===Environment===

The environment is the entire constellation of stimuli in which an organism exists.&lt;ref name="Michael, J. 2004"&gt;Michael, J. (2004). ''Concepts and principles of behavior analysis'' (rev. ed.) Kalamazoo, MI: Society for the Advancement of Behavior Analysis.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes events both inside and outside of an organism, but only real physical events are included.  A stimulus is an "energy change that affects an organism through its receptor cells".&lt;ref name="Michael, J. 2004"/&gt;

'''A stimulus can be described''':
* '''Topographically''' by its physical features.
* '''Temporally''' by when it occurs.
* '''Functionally''' by its effect on behavior.

===Reinforcement===
{{Main article|Reinforcement}}

Reinforcement is the key element in operant conditioning&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Flora, S.R. |title=The power of reinforcement |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in most behavior change programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-527 |author1=Northup, J. |author2=Vollmer, T.R. |author3=Serret, K. |year=1993 |title=Publication trends in 25 years of the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |journal= Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=527–37 |pmid=16795803 |pmc=1297882}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the process by which behavior is strengthened. If a behavior is followed closely in time by a stimulus and this results in an increase in the future frequency of that behavior, then the stimulus is a positive reinforcer. If the removal of an event serves as a reinforcer, this is termed negative reinforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are multiple [[schedules of reinforcement]] that affect the future probability of behavior.

===Punishment===
{{Main article|Punishment (psychology)}}

Punishment is a process by which a consequence immediately follows a behavior which decreases the future frequency of that behavior. As with reinforcement, a stimulus can be added ([[positive punishment]]) or removed ([[negative punishment]]). Broadly, there are three types of punishment: presentation of aversive stimuli (e.g., pain), response cost (removal of desirable stimuli as in monetary fines), and restriction of freedom (as in a 'time out').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Punishment in practice can often result in unwanted side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Reese E.P. |title=The analysis of human operant behavior |publisher=Brown |location=Dubuque IA |year=1966 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other potential unwanted effects include resentment over being punished, attempts to escape the punishment, expression of pain and negative emotions associated with it, and recognition by the punished individual between the punishment and the person delivering it.

===Extinction===
{{Main article|Extinction (psychology)}}

Extinction is the technical term to describe the procedure of withholding/discontinuing reinforcement of a previously reinforced behavior, resulting in the decrease of that behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The behavior is then set to be extinguished (Cooper et al.). Extinction procedures are often preferred over punishment procedures, as many punishment procedures are deemed unethical and in many states prohibited. Nonetheless, extinction procedures must be implemented with utmost care by professionals, as they are generally associated with extinction bursts. An extinction burst is the temporary increase in the frequency, intensity, and/or duration of the behavior targeted for extinction.&lt;ref&gt;Miltenberger, R. G. "Behavioral Modification: Principles and Procedures". [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2008. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Other characteristics of an extinction burst include an extinction-produced aggression—the occurrence of an emotional response to an extinction procedure often manifested as aggression; and b) extinction-induced response variability—the occurrence of novel behaviors that did not typically occur prior to the extinction procedure. These novel behaviors are a core component of [[shaping (psychology)|shaping]] procedures.

===Discriminated operant and three-term contingency===

In addition to a relation being made between behavior and its consequences, operant conditioning also establishes relations between antecedent conditions and behaviors. This differs from the S–R formulations (If-A-then-B), and replaces it with an AB-because-of-C formulation. In other words, the relation between a behavior (B) and its context (A) is because of consequences (C), more specifically, this relationship between AB because of C indicates that the relationship is established by prior consequences that have occurred in similar contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Moxley, R.A. |year=2004 |title=Pragmatic selectionism. The philosophy of behavior analysis |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_1_5/ai_n28246897/ |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=5 |pages=108–25 |doi=10.1037/h0100137}}&lt;/ref&gt; This antecedent–behavior–consequence contingency is termed the three-term contingency. A behavior which occurs more frequently in the presence of an antecedent condition than in its absence is called a discriminated operant. The antecedent stimulus is called a discriminative stimulus (S&lt;sup&gt;D&lt;/sup&gt;). The fact that the discriminated operant occurs only in the presence of the discriminative stimulus is an illustration of [[stimulus control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently behavior analysts have been focusing on conditions that occur prior to the circumstances for the current behavior of concern that increased the likelihood of the behavior occurring or not occurring. These conditions have been referred to variously as "Setting Event", "Establishing Operations", and "Motivating Operations" by various researchers in their publications.

===Verbal behavior===
{{Main article|Verbal Behavior}}

[[B.F. Skinner|B.F. Skinner's]] classification system of behavior analysis has been applied to treatment of a host of communication disorders.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, P. (2007). Promoting generalization and maintenance of skills learned via natural language teaching. ''SPL-ABA'' 1(4)–2(1), 97–138&lt;/ref&gt; Skinner's system includes:
* [[Tact (psychology)]] – a verbal response evoked by a non-verbal antecedent and maintained by generalized conditioned reinforcement.
* [[Mand (psychology)]] – behavior under control of motivating operations maintained by a characteristic reinforcer.
* Intraverbals – verbal behavior for which the relevant antecedent stimulus was other verbal behavior, but which does not share the response topography of that prior verbal stimulus (e.g., responding to another speaker's question).
* [[Autoclitic]] – secondary verbal behavior which alters the effect of primary verbal behavior on the listener. Examples involve quantification, grammar, and qualifying statements (e.g., the differential effects of "I think..." vs. "I know...")

For assessment of verbal behavior from Skinner's system see [[Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills]].

==Measuring behavior==

When measuring behavior, there are both dimensions of behavior and quantifiable measures of behavior. In applied behavior analysis, the quantifiable measures are a derivative of the dimensions. These dimensions are repeatability, temporal extent, and temporal locus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Johnston |first=J.M. |lastauthoramp=y |last2=Pennypacker |first2=H.S. |year=1993b |title=Readings for Strategies and tactics of behavioral research |edition=2nd |location=Hillsdale, HF |publisher=Erlbaum |isbn=0-8058-0906-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repeatability===

Response classes occur repeatedly throughout time—i.e., how many times the behavior occurs.
* '''Count''' is the number of occurrences in behavior.
* '''Rate/frequency''' is the number of instances of behavior per unit of time.
* '''Celeration''' is the measure of how the rate changes over time.

===Temporal extent===

This dimension indicates that each instance of behavior occupies some amount of time—i.e., how long the behavior occurs.
* '''Duration''' is the amount of time in which the behavior occurs.

===Temporal locus===

Each instance of behavior occurs at a specific point in time—i.e., when the behavior occurs.
* '''Response latency''' is the measure of elapsed time between the onset of a stimulus and the initiation of the response.
* '''Interresponse time''' is the amount of time that occurs between two consecutive instances of a response class.

===Derivative measures===

Derivative measures are unrelated to specific dimensions:
* '''Percentage''' is the ratio formed by combining the same dimensional quantities.
* '''Trials-to-criterion''' are the number of response opportunities needed to achieve a predetermined level of performance.

==Analyzing behavior change==

===Experimental control===

In applied behavior analysis, all experiments should include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987|p=422}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At least one participant
* At least one behavior (dependent variable)
* At least one setting
* A system for measuring the behavior and ongoing visual analysis of data
* At least one treatment or intervention condition
* Manipulations of the independent variable so that its effects on the dependent variable may be quantitatively or qualitatively analyzed
* An intervention that will benefit the participant in some way&lt;ref&gt;[[Behavioral Cusp]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functional analysis (psychology)==
{{main article|Functional analysis (psychology)}}

===History of functional analysis===

Prior to the seminal article on functional analytic methodology for aberrant behaviors, behaviorists used the behavioral technology available to them at the time. Instead of treating the function of the disruptive behavior, behavioral psychologists would instead ''pre-assume'' consequences to alter disruptive behaviors. For example, in the past to decrease self-injurious behavior in an individual, behaviorists may have delivered an aversive stimulus contingent on the response, or assume a reinforcer without identifying the reinforcer that would be most motivating to the client (Iwata, 1988). This type of intervention was successful to the individual, but it was not uncommon to see other variations of aberrant behavior begin to appear. When applied behavior analysts let clients choose from a wide array of reinforcers (often determined through data collection and reinforcement assessments) in the mid-1980s, reinforcement was shown to be more effective than punishment contingencies. In general, applied behavior analysis as a field favors reinforcement based interventions over aversive contingencies, but at the time the behavioral technology was not advanced enough and the individuals needing intervention had a right to an effective treatment (Van Houten et al., 1988). Nevertheless, not all behavioral therapies involved the use of aversives prior to the mid-1980s. Some behaviorists (for instance, [[B.F. Skinner]]) always preferred reinforcement and extinction contingencies over punishment even during that time.

In 1977, Edward Carr published a paper on potential hypotheses for the occurrence and maintenance of self-injurious behaviors. This paper laid out the initial groundwork for a functional analysis of aberrant behaviors. In the paper, Carr described five potential causes for self-injurious behaviors that included (1) positive social reinforcement contingent on the response, (2) [[negative reinforcement]] in the form of removal of an aversive stimulus contingent on the response, (3) the response produced stimuli possessed reinforcing qualities (automatic reinforcement), (4) the behavior was a byproduct of an underlying psychological condition, and (5) psychodynamic hypothesis in which the behavior was an attempt to reduce guilt. Throughout the paper, Carr cited recent research to support the first three hypotheses, and disprove the latter two hypotheses, but no formal experiment was conducted to determine the controlling variables of the problem behavior.

In 1982, Iwata and colleagues conducted the first experimental analysis of the maintaining variables for self-injurious behavior. In the paper, the researchers alternated between specific conditions to examine whether or not the behavior occurred under specific environmental conditions. Through direct manipulation of the environment, the researchers could accurately identify the controlling variables of the aberrant behavior, and provide interventions that targeted the functional relationship between the behavior and the environment. Since this seminal article was published, a wide range of research has been published in the area of functional analyses of aberrant behaviors. The methodology has since become the gold standard in assessment and treatment of aberrant behaviors.

===Functional behavior assessment (FBA)===
Functional assessment of behavior provides hypotheses about the relationships between specific environmental events and behaviors. Decades of research have established that both desirable and undesirable behaviors are learned and maintained through interactions with the social and physical environment. Functional behavior assessments are used to identify controlling variables for challenging behaviors as the basis for intervention efforts designed to decrease the occurrence of these behaviors.

===Functions of behavior===

Behavior serves two major functions for an individual: (1) to obtain desired events, or (2) to escape/avoid undesired events. Put another way, individuals engage in behavior to get something or to get out of something.  When trying to identify the function of a behavior, it is often helpful to think, "What purpose is this behavior serving the individual?" Described below are the common functions of behavior.

==== Obtain socially mediated events ====

''Access to attention (positive reinforcement: social)'':
The individual engages in the behavior to obtain attention from another person. For example, a child throws a toy because it characteristically results in mom's attention. (If this behavior results in mom looking at child and giving him lots of attention—even if she's saying "NO"—he will be more likely to engage in the same behavior in the future to get mom's attention.) Common forms of attention include, but are not limited to, hugs, kisses, reprimands, frowns, smiles, etc.

''Access to tangibles (positive reinforcement: tangible/activity)'':
The individual engages in the behavior to obtain a specific item or engage in a specific activity from another person. For example, a child hits mom because s/he wants the toy mom is holding. (If this behavior results in mom giving the child the toy, s/he will be more likely to engage in the same behavior in the future to get mom's attention.) Common forms of tangible items include, but are not limited to, food, toys, movies, video games, etc.

''Automatic positive reinforcement'':
The individual engages in the behavior because the response-produced stimulation possesses reinforcing characteristics. In other words, engaging in the behavior produces reinforcing stimulation unique to the specific context. For example, a child hits his/her eyes because it produces the specific stimulation of various colors and effects. Another example includes a child spinning a bowl on a table to produce the specific auditory stimulation unique to that object. Common forms of automatic stimulation include, but are not limited to, auditory stimulation, visual stimulation, endorphin release, etc.

==== Escape/avoid undesirable events (negative reinforcement) ====

===== Escape/avoid socially mediated events =====

''Escape/removal of attention'':
The individual engages in the behavior to escape aversive socially mediated attention. Put another way, social situations that are aversive to the child are removed contingent on the behavior occurring. For example, a child hits the teacher to avoid talking in front of the class. Common forms of aversive social situations include, but are not limited to, smiles, hugs, frowns, corrections, group settings, etc.

''Escape/removal of tasks or activities'':
The individual engages in the behavior to escape aversive tasks or demands. For example, when a child is told to take a bath he begins to cry, and his mother tells him he no longer has to take a bath. Another example includes a teacher telling a student to complete a set of worksheets, to which the student flips the desk and is sent to the principal's office. Being sent to the principal's office reinforced the behavior of flipping the desk because it allowed the child to escape the aversive activity of completing the worksheets. Common forms of aversive demands/activities include, but are not limited to, difficult tasks, changes in routines, unpredictability, etc.

===== Escape/avoid specific stimulation =====

''Automatic negative reinforcement'':
The individual engages in the behavior because it produces a decrease in aversive stimulation. Put another way, something aversive is occurring in some location on the organism's body, and engaging in the behavior decreases the level of discomfort. For example, a child bangs his head against the wall to decrease the pain experienced from a toothache. Another example includes a child scratching his arm to decrease the level of itchiness experienced from a bug bite. Common forms of aversive stimulation abated by engaging in specific behaviors include sinus pain, itching, hunger, etc.

=== Function versus topography ===

As previously stated function refers to the effect the behavior produces on the environment. The actual form of the behavior is referred to the topography. Different behaviors may serve the same function, thus describing one limitation of treating behaviors based on form alone. For example, a child may scream, hit, and cry to obtain attention from his mother. What the behavior looks like often reveals little useful information about the conditions that account for it. However, identifying the conditions that account for a behavior, suggests what conditions need to be altered to change the behavior. Therefore, assessment of function of a behavior can yield useful information with respect to intervention strategies that are likely to be effective.

=== Method of identifying functions of behavior ===

'''FBA methods can be classified into three types''':
* Indirect assessment
* Descriptive assessment
* Functional (experimental) analysis

==== Indirect FBA ====

This method uses structured interviews, checklists, rating scales, or questionnaires to obtain information from persons who are familiar with the person exhibiting the behavior to identify possible conditions or events in the natural environment that correlate with the problem behavior. They are referred to as "indirect" because they do not involve direct observation of the behavior, but rather they solicit information based on others' recollections of the behavior. This form of assessment typically yields the least reliable information about the function of behavior, but can provide insight as to possible functions of the behavior to be tested in the future, the form of the behaviors (e.g. screaming, hitting, etc.), and environments in which the behavior typically occurs (e.g. school, home, etc.). This type of assessment should be performed as the initial step of any functional behavior assessment to gather relevant information to complete more direct assessments.

==== Descriptive FBA ====

Unlike the indirect methods of FBAs, descriptive functional behavior assessment employs direct observation of behavior. These observations occur in the environment in which the behavior naturally occurs (e.g. school, home, etc.) therefore there is no direct manipulation of the environment.
The most common form of descriptive assessment involves recording the antecedents and consequences that naturally occur when the individual emits the behavior. This is referred to as ABC data collection, in which (A) represents the common antecedent, (B) represents the behavior of interest, and (C) represents the immediate consequences that occur following the behavior. ABC data collection is used to identify the naturally occurring consequences delivered in the environment in which the behavior occurs. ABC data collection can be conducted by a wide array of individuals who have received appropriate training on how to record the data.
Another form of descriptive FBA is called a scatterplot. In this assessment, staff record the time and setting in which the behavior of interest occurs over a series of days. The data are plotted on a visual scale to indicate whether there are any patterns in the behavior (for example, if the behavior occurs more frequently during math instruction than it does during lunchtime). Although this assessment does not indicate the consequences maintaining the behavior, it can be used to identify some of the antecedent conditions that typically precede the behavior of interest.

==== Functional (experimental) analysis ====

A functional analysis is the most direct form of functional behavior assessment, in which specific antecedents and consequences are systematically manipulated to test their separate effects on the behavior of interest. Each manipulation of the antecedent and consequence in a particular situation is referred to a condition. In a functional analysis, conditions are typically alternated between quite rapidly independent of responding to test the different functions of behavior. When data paths are elevated above the control condition (described below) it can be said that there is a functional relation between that condition and the behavior of interest. Complexity, time restraints, and setting restraints, are a few limitations to this particular method. When deciding to use this method, it should be noted that there is a chance of high-risk behavior and the possibility of low-rate behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://autism.outreach.psu.edu/sites/omcphplive.outreach.psu.edu.drpms.autismconference/files/42%20and%2055%20Presentation.pdf | title=Functional Analysis of Problem Behavior: the Basics | date=2010 | author=Brian A.

Below, common examples of experimental conditions are described.
A standard functional analysis normally has four conditions (three test conditions and one control).

===== Attention =====

In this condition, the experimenter gives the individual moderately preferred items and instructs them to go play. After that initial instruction, the experimenter pretends to act busy and ignores all bids for attention from the individual. If the individual engages in the behavior of interest, the experimenter provides the individual with attention (commonly in the form of a reprimand). Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be attention maintained.

===== Escape =====

In this condition, the experimenter instructs the individual that it is time to work. After the initial instruction, the experimenter delivers a series of demands that the individual is typically required to complete (e.g. math problems, cleaning up, etc.). If the individual engages in the behavior of interest, the demand is removed and the child is allowed to take a break. Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be escape maintained.

===== Alone =====
In this condition, the child is left alone with a variety of items to engage with. If the child engages in the behavior of interest, no programmed consequences are delivered. Behaviors that occur more frequently in this condition can be said to be automatically maintained.

===== Control (play) =====

In this condition, the child is allowed to engage with a variety of items during the session. No demands are placed on the child throughout the duration of the session. The experimenter provides attention to the individual throughout the session on any behavior that is not the target behavior. If the target behavior occurs, the experimenter removes attention until the behavior has subsided. This session is meant to act as a control condition, meaning that the environment is enriched for the purpose of the behavior not occurring. Said another way, by meeting environmental needs for all possible functions, the individual is not likely to engage in the behavior of interest. This condition is used as a comparison to the other conditions. Any condition that is elevated to a large degree form the control condition, shows a higher degree experimental control indicating the functional relationship between the specific environmental conditions and the behavior of interest.

===Conducting a functional behavior assessment===

Functional behavior assessments are rarely limited to only one of the methods described above. The most common, and most preferred, method for identifying the function of behavior can be seen as a four-part processes.
# The gathering of information via indirect and descriptive assessment.
# Interpretation of information from indirect and descriptive assessment and formulation of a hypothesis about the purpose of problem behavior.
# Testing of a hypothesis using a functional analysis.
# Developing intervention options based on the function of problem behavior.

===Task analysis===

[[Task analysis]] is a process in which a task is analyzed into its component parts so that those parts can be taught through the use of chaining: [[forward chaining]], [[Backward chaining (applied behavior analysis)|backward chaining]] and total task presentation. Task analysis has been used in organizational behavior management, a behavior analytic approach to changing the behaviors of members of an organization (e.g., factories, offices, or hospitals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Crowell, C.R. |author2=Anderson, D.C. |author3=Abel, D.M. |author4=Sergio, J.P. |year=1988 |title=Task clarification, performance feedback, and social praise: procedures for improving the customer service of bank tellers |journal=[[J Appl Behav Anal]] |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages= 65–71 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1988.21-65 |pmid=16795713 |pmc=1286094}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Behavioral script]]s often emerge from a task analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-89 |author1=MacDuff, G.S. |author2=Krantz, P.J. |author3=McClannahan, L.E. |year=1993 |title=Teaching children with autism to use photographic activity schedules: Maintenance and generalization of complex response chains |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=89–97 |pmid=8473261 |pmc=1297722}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1901/jaba.1993.26-121 |author1=Krantz, P.J. |author2=McClannahan, L.E. |year=1993 |title=Teaching children with autism to initiate to peers: Effects of a script-fading procedure |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=121–32 |pmid=8473251 |pmc=1297725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bergan conducted a task analysis of the behavioral consultation relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Bergan, J.R. |year=1977 |title=Behavioral Consultation |publisher=Merrill |isbn=0-675-08488-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas Kratochwill developed a training program based on teaching Bergan's skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kratochwill, T.R. |author2=Van Someren, K.R. |author3=Sheridan, S.M. |year=1989 |title=Training behavioral consultants: a competency-based model to teach interview skills |journal=Professional School Psychology |volume=4 |pages=41–58 |doi=10.1037/h0090570}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach was used for the development of microskills training for counselors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ivey, A.E. |author2=Normington, C.J. |author3=Miller, C.D. |author4=Morrill, W.H. |author5=Haase, R.F. |year=1968 |title=Microcounseling and attending behavior: an approach to prepracticum counselor training |journal=[[J Couns Psychol]] |volume=15 |issue=5, pt. 2 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.1037/h0026129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ivey, A.E. |author2=Ivey, M.B. |year=1998 |title=Intentional Interviewing and Counseling: Facilitating Client Development in a Multicultural Society |edition=4th |publisher=Brooks/Cole |isbn=0-534-35756-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Iwata, B.A. |author2=Wong, S.E. |author3=Riordan, M.M. |author4=Dorsey, M.F. |author5=Lau, M.M. |year=1982 |title=Assessment and training of clinical interviewing skills: Analogue analysis and field replication |journal=Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis |pmid=7118753 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=191–203 |doi=10.1901/jaba.1982.15-191 |pmc=1308264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivey would later call this "behaviorist" phase a very productive one&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Couns Dev |year=2001 |volume=79 |issue=1 |pages=105–18 |title=Allen E.

===Chaining===
{{Main article|Chaining}}

The skill to be learned is broken down into small units for easy learning. For example, a person learning to brush teeth independently may start with learning to unscrew the toothpaste cap. Once they have learned this, the next step may be squeezing the tube, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cooper|Heron|Heward|1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weiss, K.M. |year=1978 |title=A comparison of forward and backward procedures for the acquisition of response chains in humans |journal=J Exp Anal Behav |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=255–59 |doi=10.1901/jeab.1978.29-255 |pmid=16812053 |pmc=1332753}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For problem behavior, chains can also be analyzed and the chain can be disrupted to prevent the problem behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Walker, H.M. |year=1995 |title=The Acting-Out Child: Coping With Classroom Disruption |edition=2nd |publisher=Sopris West |isbn=1-57035-047-7}}{{page needed|date=August 2011}}&lt;!-- Please add chapter= or pages= for this citation. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some behavior therapies, such as [[dialectical behavior therapy]], make extensive use of behavior chain analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Linehan, M.M. |year=1993 |title=Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder |publisher=The Guilford Press |isbn=0-89862-034-1}}{{page needed|date=August 2011}}&lt;!-- Please add chapter= or pages= for this citation. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prompting===

A [[Response Prompting Procedures|prompt]] is a cue that is used to encourage a desired response from an individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ontario Ministry of Education |year=2007 |title=Effective Educational Practices for Students with ASD |publisher=Queen's Printer for Ontario}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prompts are often categorized into a prompt hierarchy from most intrusive to least intrusive, although there is some controversy about what is considered most intrusive, those that are physically intrusive or those that are hardest prompt to fade (e.g.,verbal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barnett, D.W. |year=2006 |title=Preschool Intervention Scripts: Lessons from 20 years of Research and Practice |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6888/is_2_2/ai_n28461339/ |journal=Journal of Speech Language Pathology and Applied Behavior Analysis |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=158–81 |doi=10.1037/h0100216|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to minimize errors and ensure a high level of success during learning, prompts are given in a most-to-least sequence and faded systematically.&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Pear 2003"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Martin |last2=Pear |year=2003 |title=Behavior Modification: What is it and how to do it? |edition=7th |location=Upper Saddle River NJ |publisher=Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this process, prompts are faded quickly as possible so that the learner does not come to depend on them and eventually behaves appropriately without prompting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=VanDerHeyden, A.M. |author2=Snyder, P. |author3=DiCarlo, C.F. |author4=Stricklin, S.B. |author5=Vagianos, L.A. |year=2002 |title=Comparison of within-stimulus and extra-stimulus prompts to increase targeted play behaviors in an inclusive early intervention program |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_2_3/ai_n28132946/ |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=188–97 |doi=10.1037/h0099967}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chesnut, M. |author2=Williamson, P.N. |author3=Morrow, J.E. |year=2003 |title=The use of visual cues to teach receptive skills to children with severe auditory discrimination deficits |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_2_4/ai_n28173253/ |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=212–24 |doi=10.1037/h0100120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Types of prompts'''
Prompters might use any or all of the following to suggest the desired response:
* Vocal prompts: Words or other vocalizations
* Visual prompts: A visual cue or picture
* Gestural prompts: A physical gesture
* Positional prompt: e.g., the target item is placed close to the individual.
* Modeling: Modeling the desired response. This type of prompt is best suited for individuals who learn through imitation and can attend to a model.
* Physical prompts: Physically manipulating the individual to produce the desired response. There are many degrees of physical prompts, from quite intrusive (e.g. the teacher places a hand on the learner's hand) to minimally intrusive (e.g. a slight tap).&lt;ref name="Martin &amp; Pear 2003"/&gt;

This is not an exhaustive list of prompts; the nature, number, and order of prompts are chosen to be the most effective for a particular individual.

===Fading===

The overall goal is for an individual to eventually not need prompts. As an individual gains mastery of a skill at a particular prompt level, the prompt is faded to a less intrusive prompt. This ensures that the individual does not become overly dependent on a particular prompt when learning a new behavior or skill.

===Thinning a reinforcement schedule===

Thinning is often confused with fading. Fading refers to a prompt being removed, where thinning refers to an increase in the time or number of responses required between reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=LeBlanc, L.A. |author2=Hagoplan, L.P. |author3=Maglieri, K.A. |author4=Poling, A. |year=2002 |title=Decreasing the intensity of reinforcement-based interventions for reducing behavior: conceptual issues and a proposed model for clinical practice |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_3_3/ai_n28132960/ |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=289–300 |doi=10.1037/h0099991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Periodic thinning that produces a 30% decrease in reinforcement has been suggested as an efficient way to thin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cautilli, J. |year=2005 |title=Brief report: application of proposed model of decreasing reinforcement intensity |journal=Int J Behav Consult Ther |url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6886/is_1_1/ai_n28321102/ |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=21–36 |doi=10.1037/h0100731}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schedule thinning is often an important and neglected issue in [[contingency management]] and [[token economy]] systems, especially when these are developed by unqualified practitioners (see [[professional practice of behavior analysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, J.S. &amp; Burch, M.R. (2005). ''Ethics for behavior analysts.'' LEA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generalization===

Generalization is the expansion of a student's performance ability beyond the initial conditions set for acquisition of a skill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alberto  |last2=Troutman |year=2006 |title=Applied behavior analysis for teachers |edition=7th  |location=Upper Saddle River NJ |publisher=Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generalization can occur across people, places, and materials used for teaching. For example, once a skill is learned in one setting, with a particular instructor, and with specific materials, the skill is taught in more general settings with more variation from the initial acquisition phase. For example, if a student has successfully mastered learning colors at the table, the teacher may take the student around the house or his school and then ''generalize'' the skill in these more natural environments with other materials. Behavior analysts have spent considerable amount of time studying factors that lead to generalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Osnes, P.G. |author2=Lieblein, T. |year=2003 |title=An explicit technology of generalization |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_4_3/ai_n28132927/ |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=364–74 |doi=10.1037/h0099994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shaping===
{{Main article|Shaping (psychology)}}

Shaping involves gradually modifying the existing behavior into the desired behavior. If the student engages with a dog by hitting it, then he or she could have their behavior shaped by reinforcing interactions in which he or she touches the dog more gently. Over many interactions, successful shaping would replace the hitting behavior with patting or other gentler behavior. Shaping is based on a behavior analyst's thorough knowledge of [[operant conditioning]] principles and [[extinction (psychology)|extinction]]. Recent efforts to teach shaping have used simulated computer tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kemp, S.M. |author2=Eckerman, D.A. |year=2002 |title=Simulating a shaping task |journal=Behav Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_2_3/ai_n28132944/ |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=166–78 |doi=10.1037/h0099975}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One teaching technique found to be effective with some students, particularly children, is the use of video modeling (the use of taped sequences as exemplars of behavior). It can be used by therapists to assist in the acquisition of both verbal and [[voluntary action|motor]] responses, in some cases for long [[chaining|chains]] of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=D'Ateno, P. |author2=Mangiapanello, K. |author3=Taylor, B.A. |year= 2002 |title=Using video modeling to teach complex play sequences to a preschooler with autism |journal=J Posit Behav Interv |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=5–11 |doi=10.1177/10983007030050010801}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Corbett, B.A. |author2=Abdullah, M. |year=2005 |title=Video modeling: why does it work for children with autism? |journal=J Early Intensive Behav Interv |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=2–8 |doi=10.1037/h0100294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interventions based on an FBA===

Critical to behavior analytic interventions is the concept of a systematic behavioral [[case formulation]] with a functional behavioral assessment or analysis at the core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tryon, W.W. |year=1976 |title=A system of behavioral diagnosis |journal=[[Prof Psychol]] |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=495–506 |doi=10.1037/0735-7028.7.4.495}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kanfer, F.H. |author2=Saslow, G. |year=1969 |chapter=Behavioral diagnosis |editor=Franks CM |title=Behavior Therapy: Appraisal and Status |publisher=McGraw-Hill |pages=417–44 |oclc=24223}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach should apply a behavior analytic [[theory of change]] (see [[Behavioral change theories]]). This formulation should include a thorough functional assessment, a skills assessment, a sequential analysis (behavior chain analysis), an ecological assessment, a look at existing evidenced-based behavioral models for the problem behavior (such as Fordyce's model of chronic pain)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Romano, J.M. |author2=Jensen, M.P. |author3=Turner, J.A. |author4=Good, A.B. |author5=Hops, H. |year=2000 |title=Chronic pain patient-partner interactions: further support for a behavioral model of chronic pain |journal=Behav Ther |volume=31 |issue=3 |doi=10.1016/S0005-7894(00)80023-4 |pages=415–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then a treatment plan based on how environmental factors influence behavior.

ABA-based techniques are often used to change behaviors associated with [[autism]], so much so that ABA itself is often mistakenly considered to be synonymous with [[therapy for autism]].&lt;ref name=As-in-ABA/&gt; ABA for autism may be limited by diagnostic severity and IQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shreck, K.A. |author2=Metz, B. |author3=Mulick, J.A. |author4=Smith, A. |year=2000 |title=Making it fit: A Provocative Look at Models of Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention for Children with Autism |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_3_1/ai_n28820046/ |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=27–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mary Jane Weiss |author2=Delmolino Lara |year=2006 |title=The Relationship Between Early Learning Rates and Treatment Outcome For Children With Autism Receiving Intensive Home-Based Applied Behavior Analysis |journal=The Behavior Analyst Today |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6884/is_1_7/ai_n28460870/ |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=96–105 |doi=10.1037/h0100140}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most influential and widely cited review of the literature regarding efficacy of treatments for autism is the National Research Council's book ''Educating Children with Autism'' (2001) which concluded that ABA was the best research supported and most effective treatment for the main characteristics of autism. Some critics{{who|date=September 2016}} claimed that the NRC's report was an inside job by behavior analysts  but there were no board certified behavior analysts on the panel (which did include physicians, speech pathologists, educators, psychologists, and others). Other criticisms raised include the small sample sizes used in the published research to date. Medications have not been proven to correct the core deficits of ASDs and are not the primary treatment.  ABA is the primary treatment according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Management of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders|url = http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/120/5/1162|journal = Pediatrics|date = 1 November 2007|issn = 0031-4005|pmid = 17967921|pages = 1162–1182|volume = 120|issue = 5|doi = 10.1542/peds.2007-2362|first = Scott M.|last = Myers|first2 = Chris Plauché|last2 = Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent reviews of the [[Efficacy#Healthcare|efficacy]] of ABA-based techniques in autism include:
* A 2007 clinical report of the [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] concluded that the benefit of ABA-based interventions in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) "has been well documented" and that "children who receive early intensive behavioral treatment have been shown to make substantial, sustained gains in IQ, language, academic performance, and [[adaptive behavior]] as well as some measures of social behavior".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Pediatrics |year=2007 |volume=120 |issue=5 |pages=1162–82 |title=Management of children with autism spectrum disorders |author1=Myers, S.M. |author2=Johnson, C.P. |author3=Council on Children with Disabilities |doi=10.1542/peds.2007-2362 |pmid=17967921 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/120/5/1162 |laysummary=http://aap.org/advocacy/releases/oct07autism.htm |laysource=AAP |laydate=2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Researchers from the [[MIND Institute]] published an evidence-based review of comprehensive treatment approaches in 2008. On the basis of "the strength of the findings from the four best-designed, controlled studies", they were of the opinion that one ABA-based approach (the [[Lovaas technique]] created by [[Ole Ivar Løvaas]]) is "well-established" for improving intellectual performance of young children with ASD.&lt;ref name=Rogers2008&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol |year=2008 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=8–38 |title=Evidence-based comprehensive treatments for early autism |author1=Rogers, S.J. |author2=Vismara, L.A. |doi=10.1080/15374410701817808 |pmc=2943764 |pmid=18444052}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2009 review of psycho-educational interventions for children with autism whose mean age was six years or less at intake found that five high-quality ("Level 1" or "Level 2") studies assessed ABA-based treatments. On the basis of these and other studies, the author concluded that ABA is "well-established" and is "demonstrated effective in enhancing global functioning in pre-school children with autism when treatment is intensive and carried out by trained therapists".&lt;ref name=Eikeseth2009&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Res Dev Disabil |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=158–78 |year=2009 |title=Outcome of comprehensive psycho-educational interventions for young children with autism |author=Eikeseth, S. |doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2008.02.003 |pmid=18385012|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5467678_Outcome_of_comprehensive_psycho-educational_interventions_for_young_children_with_autism}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the review committee also concluded that "there is a great need for more knowledge about which interventions are most effective".
* A 2009 paper included a descriptive analysis, an effect size analysis, and a [[meta-analysis]] of 13 reports published from 1987 to 2007 of early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI, a form of ABA-based treatment with origins in the Lovaas technique) for autism. It determined that EIBI's effect sizes were "generally positive" for IQ, adaptive behavior, expressive language, and receptive language. The paper did note limitations of its findings including the lack of published comparisons between EIBI and other "empirically validated treatment programs".&lt;ref name=Reichow2009&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=23–41 |year=2009 |title=Comprehensive synthesis of early intensive behavioral interventions for young children with autism based on the UCLA Young Autism Project model |author1=Reichow, B. |author2=Wolery, M. |doi=10.1007/s10803-008-0596-0 |pmid=18535894}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a 2009 [[systematic review]] of 11 studies published from 1987 to 2007, the researchers wrote "there is strong evidence that EIBI is effective for some, but not all, children with autism spectrum disorders, and there is wide variability in response to treatment". Furthermore, any improvements are likely to be greatest in the first year of intervention.&lt;ref name=Howlin2009&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Howlin, P. |author2=Magiati, I. |author3=Charman, T. |editor=MacLean, Jr. |editor2=William E. |title=Systematic review of early intensive behavioral interventions for children with autism |journal=Am J Intellect Dev Disabil |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=23–41 |year=2009 |pmid=19143460 |doi=10.1352/2009.114:23-41}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2009 meta-analysis of nine studies published from 1987 to 2007 concluded that EIBI has a "large" effect on full-scale intelligence and a "moderate" effect on adaptive behavior in autistic children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Eldevik, S. |author2=Hastings, R.P. |author3=Hughes, J.C. |author4=Jahr, E. |author5=Eikeseth, S. |author6=Cross, S. |title=Meta-analysis of Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention for children with autism |journal=J Clin Child Adolesc Psychol |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=439–50 |year=2009 |pmid=19437303 |doi=10.1080/15374410902851739}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2011, investigators from [[Vanderbilt University]] under contract with the [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]] performed a comprehensive review of the scientific literature on ABA-based and other therapies for autism spectrum disorders; the ABA-based therapies included the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]/Lovaas method and the Early Start Denver Model (the latter developed by Sally Rogers and [[Geraldine Dawson]]).&lt;ref name=VanderbiltAHRQ2011&gt;{{cite book |author1=Warren, Z. |author2=Veenstra-VanderWeele, J. |author3=Stone, W. |author4=Bruzek, J.L. |author5=Nahmias, A.S. |author6=Foss-Feig, J.H. |author7=Jerome, R.N. |author8=Krishnaswami, S. |author9=Sathe, N.A. |author10=Glasser, A.M. |author11=Surawicz, T. |author12=McPheeters, M.L. |title=Therapies for children with autism spectrum disorders |year=2011 |url=http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/106/656/CER26_Autism_Report_04-14-2011.pdf |series=AHRQ Publication No. 11-EHC029-EF, Comparative Effectiveness Review No. 26 |publisher=Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality |location=Rockville, MD |access-date=15 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002035802/http://www.effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/ehc/products/106/656/CER26_Autism_Report_04-14-2011.pdf |archive-date=2 October 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They concluded that "both approaches were associated with ... improvements in cognitive performance, language skills, and adaptive behavior skills".&lt;ref name=VanderbiltAHRQ2011/&gt;{{rp|ES-9}} However, they also concluded that "the strength of evidence ... is low", "many children continue to display prominent areas of impairment", "subgroups may account for a majority of the change", there is "little evidence of practical effectiveness or feasibility beyond research studies", and the published studies "used small samples, different treatment approaches and duration, and different outcome measurements".&lt;ref name=VanderbiltAHRQ2011/&gt;{{rp|ES-10}}

A 2009 systematic review and meta-analysis by Spreckley and Boyd of four small-n 2000–2007 studies (involving a total of 76 children) came to different conclusions than the aforementioned reviews.&lt;ref name= Spreckley2009&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Spreckley, M. |author2=Boyd, R. |title=Efficacy of applied behavioral intervention in preschool children with autism for improving cognitive, language, and adaptive behavior: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal=J Pediatr |volume=154 |issue=3 |pages=338–44 |year=2009 |pmid=18950798 |doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2008.09.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spreckley and Boyd reported that applied behavior intervention (ABI), another name for EIBI, did not significantly improve outcomes compared with standard care of preschool children with ASD in the areas of cognitive outcome, expressive language, receptive language, and adaptive behavior.&lt;ref name=Spreckley2009/&gt; In a letter to the editor, however, authors of the four studies meta-analyzed claimed that Spreckley and Boyd had misinterpreted one study comparing two forms of ABI with each other as a comparison of ABI with standard care, which erroneously decreased the observed efficacy of ABI.&lt;ref name=Smith2009&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Smith, T. |author2=Eikeseth, S. |author3=Sallows, G.O. |author4=Graupner, T.D. |title=Efficacy of applied behavior analysis in autism |journal=J Pediatr |volume=155 |issue=1 |pages=151–52; author reply 152–53 |year=2009 |pmid=19559310 |doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2009.01.065}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the four studies' authors raised the possibility that Spreckley and Boyd had excluded some other studies unnecessarily, and that including such studies could have led to a more favorable evaluation of ABI.&lt;ref name=Smith2009/&gt; Spreckley, Boyd, and the four studies' authors did agree that large multi-site [[randomized trial]]s are needed to improve the understanding of ABA's efficacy in autism.&lt;ref name=Smith2009/&gt; Some initial, theoretical work has been initiated to use applied behavioral analysis (ABA) as a foundation for agent-mediated, AI-based instructions for children with autism spectrum disorder.&lt;ref name="Begoli, PRS-ABA, ABA Ontology"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Begoli|first1=Edmon|title=Procedural-Reasoning Architecture for Applied Behavior Analysis-based Instructions|date=May 2014|publisher=University of Tennessee, Knoxville|location=Knoxville, Tennessee, USA|pages=44–79|url=http://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/2749|accessdate=14 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A United States District Court Judge ruled withholding ABA from children (0–21) with autism causes irreparable harm, finding Elizabeth Dudek of Florida's Agency for Healthcare Administration's position suggesting ABA was experimental was arbitrary and capricious, ordering AHCA enjoined from withholding ABA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://autism-u.com/helpdoc/Order-Case-No-11-20684-CIV.PDF Permanent Injunction Order]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thereafter, CMS ordered its guidance that all states to cover ABA via [[Head Start (program)|Head Start]] and [[Early Head Start]] EPSDT programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.medicaid.gov/Federal-Policy-Guidance/Downloads/CIB-07-07-14.pdf | title=CMCS Informational Bulletin: Clarification of Medicaid Coverage of Services to Children with Autism | publisher=Department of Health &amp; Human Services | date=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further research is clearly required, specifically to include larger and thus more representative samples.

===Criticism===
Conversely, various major figures within the autistic community have written biographies detailing harm caused by the provision of ABA. Several of these people have since been diagnosed with [[PTSD]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. Less scholarly reviews were provided by [[Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn|Elizabeth Devita-Raeburn]] in ''[[The Atlantic]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/08/aba-autism-controversy/495272/|title=Is the Most Common Therapy for Autism Cruel?|first=Elizabeth|last=DeVita-Raeburn|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; magazine and by an ex-practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sociallyanxiousadvocate.wordpress.com/2015/05/22/why-i-left-aba/|title=Why I Left ABA|first= Anxious |last=Advocate |website=sociallyanxiousadvocate.wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy regarding ABA persists in the autism community. A 2017 study, based on a survey of 'post-traumatic stress symptoms' completed by individuals with presumed, self-reported diagnosis of ASD and their caregivers, found that 46% of the individuals who also reported receiving ABA treatment met the author's "diagnostic threshold for PTSD" via their survey score, versus 28% of respondents not reporting receipt of ABA treatment. Individuals reported as receiving ABA were 86% more likely on average (41% for adults, 130% for children) to meet the author's "diagnostic threshold".&lt;ref&gt;Henny Kupferstein. Evidence of increased PTSD symptoms in autism exposed to applied behavior analysis . "Advances in Autism". 4 (1), pp. 19-29, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 2017 study was heavily criticized by peer reviewers who noted, among other things, that her methods for recruiting participants were faulty, she did not use appropriate operative definitions for PTSS versus PTSD, and there was detected bias baked into the hypothesis of the study.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Barrett Leaf. Evaluating Kupferstein's claims of the relationship of behavioral intervention to PTSS for individuals with autism. "Emerald Insight". Advances in Autism, 4(3), 122-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Architectural History''''' is the main journal of the [[Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain]] (SAHGB).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sahgb.org.uk/index.cfm/display_page/Publications Publications: Architectural History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311062734/http://www.sahgb.org.uk/index.cfm/display_page/Publications |date=2011-03-11 }}, ''Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal is published each autumn and usually comprises around 400 pages. The architecture of the [[British Isles]] is a major theme of the journal, but articles can consider all places and periods. All articles are double peer-reviewed, anonymously; acceptance is dependent on satisfactory referees' comments and revision. All members of the SAHGB receive the journal, as do subscribing institutional libraries. Older issues from its inception in 1958 onwards are available online through [[JSTOR]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/journal/archhist Architectural History], [[JSTOR]]. {{ISSN|0066-622X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lead editor, Dr Alistair Fair, is a Research Associate at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arct.cam.ac.uk/people/ajf56@cam.ac.uk |title=Dr Alistair Fair BA (Oxon.), MA (Lond.), PhD (Cantab.) |publisher=Department of Architecture, [[University of Cambridge]] |accessdate=23 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006033355/http://www.arct.cam.ac.uk/people/ajf56%40cam.ac.uk |archivedate=6 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10917">An '''asset management plan''' ('''AMP''') is a tactical plan for managing an organisation's [[infrastructure]] and other assets to deliver an agreed standard of service. Typically, an asset management plan will cover more than a single asset, taking a system approach - especially where a number of assets are co-dependent and are required to work together to deliver an agreed standard of service.

The International Infrastructure Management Manual&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nams.org.nz/International%20Infrastructure%20Management%20Manual International Infrastructure Management Manual] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014032855/http://www.nams.org.nz/International%20Infrastructure%20Management%20Manual |date=October 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; defines an asset management plan as; "a plan developed for the management of one or more infrastructure assets that combines multi-disciplinary management techniques (including technical and financial) over the life cycle of the asset in the most cost effective manner to provide a specific level of service."

==Objectives==
Twofold: justification and optimization
* Justification - to give visibility of the costs and benefits associated with providing the agreed standard of service.
* Optimisation - to minimize the whole-life cost, including the operation, maintenance and replacement or disposal of each asset in the system.

Clearly for either of the above to work, the Standard of Service needs to be defined (in a measurable way) for each asset in an asset system.

The first part can be achieved relatively quickly, and is necessary before the decentralization of decision-making around maintenance and replacement can really occur, but the second requires ongoing work in local teams, together with better guidance from the center.

An asset management plan should take a "horses for courses" approach - not a one size fits all, but needs based - taking into account the basic information required. Beyond this, it should be built upon by the local asset manager according to local needs. A fully developed Asset Management approach usually  requires a number of iterations of the AMP, and needs to be reviewed more frequently for more complex systems, especially asset systems where the average annual cost required to provide the agreed standard of service is high.

==Typical contents==
An AMP typically covers the following areas:

# Asset System Description
# Standard of Service Definition
# Current Asset Performance
# Planned Actions
# Costs
# Benefits
# Potential Improvements

===Asset system description===
Description of the problem that the asset system aims to reduce. What assets are currently employed to address the problem?
Essentially, why do these assets exist? What would occur if these assets didn't exist. Identify dependencies between different parts of the asset system.
This is important to understand why the assets are there in the first place.

===Standard of service definition===
How should the above assets be performing and to what condition?
Define the Standard of Service (SoS) for the various parts of the asset system or group (a simple performance specification). Describe how the system, as a whole, is intended to perform in a measurable way. Usually consists of two parts, a measurable performance specification, and a minimum condition grade (CG).

The minimum CG should take account of the potential consequences of failure i.e. a flood defence protecting an urban area that would flood to a depth of 1m should the wall fail under design conditions should have a higher minimum CG (2 or 3). An earth embankment that is only protecting agricultural land, where the consequences of failure are significantly less will likely have a lower minimum CG (4 or 5)

If further refinement is necessary, the minimum condition grade should also take into account the likely failure mechanism - if failure of an asset is likely to occur very slowly and can be monitored, then a minimum condition of 2 or 3 is unlikely to be required - a minimum of CG4 can probably be justified. Conversely an asset that is liable to a fast failure mode with little warning will likely require a higher minimum condition.

Example Standards of Service for Flood Risk Management Assets:

A. Walls: 5.2m high until [[chainage]] 540m where the height drops to 5.1m.
The condition of the walls will be maintained to CG3 or better (due to urban area)

B. Culverts: under 3 carriageways, total of 120 m length (40 m each) provide conveyance for 30 m³/s without surcharging.
The condition of the culverts will be maintained to CG4 or better (under a rural road with alternative routings)

C. Pump station: provides capacity of 12 m³/s to drain the catchment during periods of tide-lock (usually every high-tide, for a period of 4 hours.)
The condition of the pump station will be maintained to CG2 or better (no redundancy)

D. Weir: provides a minimum water-level of 3.6 m to the watercourse above
The condition of the weir will be maintained to CG5 or better (minimal consequences of failure)

For some assets, there may be a legal obligation to maintain and operate the asset to a certain SoS.

This is important to understand what function the assets were designed to perform, and what minimum condition is considered acceptable.

===Current asset performance===
What condition are the assets currently in?
List/inventory and condition of all "assets" within the system, with their unique identifiers. This could include information such as asset owner, age, estimate of remaining life etc.
This is important to understand what state the assets are currently in.

===Planned actions and lifecycle management===
A short narrative explaining the near-term actions required to bridge the gap between where we are, and where we want to be. In the case where we are already at or above the agreed SoS, this section explains how we will continue to do so for the least cost - enabling an innovative approach to providing the agreed SoS.

This is important to understand what actions are planned to bring or keep the assets above their minimum condition, and able to perform their intended function.

===Costs===
What are the short, medium and longer-term costs for the asset system? A forward looking cost-profile for operating, maintaining, refurbishing and replacing to sustain the Standard of Service. Ideally the cost-profile will extend to cover the life of the longest-lived asset in the system, so as to estimate the whole-life cost, and make it possible to determine the average annual costs.

This section may need to be revisited and updated annually, and may form the basis for an annual bid for funding.

The numbers provided for the in-year (year 0) and the next three years (1 - 3), should be fairly accurate. Beyond that, estimates of costs to as to enable planning for any large expenditure items expected in the medium-term and to allow sufficient time to do a more in depth appraisal for an asset system that may require a change to the Standard of Service. Alternative management regimes should be considered to optimise the cost of providing the SoS. Where assumptions have been made, the basis for these should be provided.

This is important to understand what the planned actions are going to cost, as well as the ongoing "management" and overheads directly related to this particular asset system. Also essential from a local perspective, is optimizing the approach to providing the SoS.

===Benefits===
Why do we want to sustain the agreed standard of service of the assets in this asset system?
Without exception, assets should provide some measure of benefits that can be measured or explained. This will usually involve the translation of the standard of service into a monetary figure. Other benefits may be social or environmental, which may be difficult to quantify in monetary or quantitative terms, but some attempt to record all the relevant benefits is important, and more qualitative means may be employed.

===Improvements===
Potential improvements to the Standard of Service:
The standard of service currently delivered may be improved by acquisition, enhancement or other means. An "improvement" may also include the potential to reduce the standard of service, and potentially even dispose or divest of an asset or assets in an asset system.

These improvements represents a potential change to the standard of service and is typically managed as a project, complete with some form of appraisal of the additional expenditure, comparing different options and selecting a preferred options based on whatever decision process is appropriate.

The development and justification of a change project is outside the scope of an asset management plan.

===Alternate contents===
The Queensland Department of Local Government, Sport &amp; Recreation circulated a letter to Queensland Councils in December 2008 which specified the minimum requirements for asset management plans in Queensland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lgam.wikidot.com/minimum-requirements-for-asset-management-plans-queensland |title=Asset Management &amp; Local Government Knowledge Base |publisher=Lgam.wikidot.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These requirements include:
*Introduction and Overview
*Service Levels (derived from Service Planning)
*Future Demand (derived from Corporate Planning and Service Planning)
*Lifecycle Management and Financial Considerations
*Asset Management Practices
*Improvement and Monitoring

==Legislation==
Section 104(6) of the Queensland Local Government Bill 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/Bills/52PDF/2008/LocalGovtB08.pdf |title=Queensland Local Government Bill 2008 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines a "long-term asset management plan" as a document that -
*outlines the local government's goals, strategies and policies for managing the local government's assets and infrastructure, during the period covered by the plan; and
*covers a period of at least 10 years after the commencement of the plan.
It states that a local government must annually conduct, and report on the results of, a review of the implementation of the plan.

In Canada, since 2015 the government of [[Ontario]] has mandated municipalities to develop asset management plans for their infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/15i15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trid.trb.org"&gt;[https://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=1437181 El-Diraby, T.

==Book rentals==
Historically before the [[industrial revolution]], books were too expensive for commoners to buy, and there were businesses which made profit by renting out books for a fee. ''[[Kashi-hon]]'' in [[Japan]] was one of such businesses. In modern era in developing and developed nations, for-profit book rental services have started to lend physical [[books]], [[audiobook]] CDs, e-books, and audiobook MP3s through stores and/or by an online (website) interface after popularization of the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)|url = http://www.w3.org/|website = www.w3.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most book rental companies provide books with doorstep delivery using logistic services. Following the popular [[Netflix]] model for video rental, many book companies have applied features such as unlimited rentals, free shipping, and no late fees to their book distribution services.

== Book rental models ==

=== Based on rental method ===
Based on the rental method the book rental companies can be categorized into two subgroups:
# Book rental companies having a subscription-based models where a monthly or periodic subscription fee is charged and members can rent a number of books based on the subscription. 
# Book rental companies taking a fraction of book cost as rent. This is the most prevalent model in textbook and college book renting.

=== Based on type of book rented ===
Based on the type of books that the book rental service rents following classification can be done:
# Physical or Printed Books. The category can further be subdivided into 
## Companies primarily renting novels, fiction and story books. 
# E-book renters. Many companies renting physical books also rent e-books. Since e-book rental distribution rights are totally different from physical books most of the smaller companies are not able to rent e-books for standard publishers like [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill]], [[Pearson Education|Pearson]], [[Prentice Hall]], [[Cengage Learning|Cengage]] etc due to high license fees that needs to be paid for rental rights.

'''Classical architecture''' usually denotes [[architecture]] which is more or less consciously derived from the principles of [[Ancient Greek architecture|Greek]] and [[Ancient Roman architecture|Roman architecture]] of [[classical antiquity]], or sometimes even more specifically, from the works of [[Vitruvius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fleming| first1 = John| last2 = Honour| first2 = Hugh| last3 = Pevsner| first3 = Nikolaus| authorlink = | title = Dictionary of architecture | publisher = Penguin Books Ltd | series = | volume = | edition = 3| year = 1986| location = | page = 76| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-14-051013-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Watkin| first1 = David| authorlink = | title = A History of Western Architecture | publisher = Watson-Guptill Publications | series = | volume = | edition = 4| year = 2005| location = | pages = 6–8| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8230-2277-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different [[Architectural style|styles]] of classical architecture have arguably existed since the [[Carolingian Renaissance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fleming| first1 = John| last2 = Honour| first2 = Hugh| last3 = Pevsner| first3 = Nikolaus| authorlink = | title = Dictionary of architecture | publisher = Penguin Books Ltd | series = | volume = | edition = 3| year = 1986| location = | page = 76| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-14-051013-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and prominently since the [[Italian Renaissance]]. Although classical styles of architecture can vary greatly, they can in general all be said to draw on a common "vocabulary" of decorative and constructive elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fleming| first1 = John| last2 = Honour| first2 = Hugh| last3 = Pevsner| first3 = Nikolaus| authorlink = | title = Dictionary of architecture | publisher = Penguin Books Ltd | series = | volume = | edition = 3| year = 1986| location = | page = 76| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-14-051013-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Watkin| first1 = David| authorlink = | title = A History of Western Architecture | publisher = Watson-Guptill Publications | series = | volume = | edition = 4| year = 2005| location = | pages = 6–8| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-8230-2277-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Summerson| first1 = John| authorlink = | title = The Classical Language of Architecture | publisher = Thames and Hudson Ltd| series = | volume = | edition = | year = 1980| location = | pages = 7–8| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-500-20177-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In much of the Western world, different classical architectural styles have dominated the history of architecture from the Renaissance until the second world war, though it continues to inform many architects to this day.

The term "classical architecture" also applies to any mode of architecture that has evolved to a highly refined state, such as classical Chinese architecture, or classical Mayan architecture.  It can also refer to any architecture that employs classical aesthetic philosophy. The term might be used differently from "traditional" or "[[vernacular architecture]]", although it can share underlying axioms with it.

For contemporary buildings following authentic classical principles, the term [[New Classical Architecture]] may be used.

==History==

===Origins===
Classical architecture is derived from the architecture of ancient Greece and ancient Rome. With the [[Deposition of Romulus Augustulus|collapse of the western part of the Roman empire]], the architectural traditions of the Roman empire ceased to be practised in large parts of western Europe. In the [[Byzantine Empire]], the ancient ways of building lived on but relatively soon  developed into a distinct [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine style]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Adam| first1 = Robert| authorlink = | title = Classical Architecture | publisher = Viking| series = | volume = | edition = | year = 1992| location = | pages = 16| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first conscious efforts to bring back the disused language of form of classical antiquity into Western architecture can be traced to the [[Carolingian architecture|Carolingian Renaissance]] of the late 8th and 9th centuries. The gatehouse of [[Lorsch Abbey]] (c. 800), in present-day [[Germany]] thus displays a system of alternating attached columns and arches which could be an almost direct paraphrase of e.g., that of the [[Colosseum]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Pevsner| first1 = Nikolaus| authorlink = | title = An Outline of European Architecture | publisher = Penguin Books Ltd| series = | volume = | edition = 7| year = 1964| location = | pages = 45–47| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Byzantine architecture]], just as [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and even to some extent [[Gothic architecture]] (with which classical architecture is often posed), can also incorporate classical elements and details but do not to the same degree reflect a conscious effort to draw upon the architectural traditions of antiquity; for example, they do not observe the idea of [[Classical order|a systematic order of proportions for pillars]]. In general, therefore, they are not considered classical archerchitectural styles in a strict sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Summerson| first1 = John| authorlink = | title = The Classical Language of Architecture | publisher = Thames and Hudson Ltd| series = | volume = | edition = | year = 1980| location = | pages = 7–8| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-500-20177-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
[[File:S Maria Nuova (Vicenza) 20081204-1 retouched.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The emphatically classical church façade of Santa Maria Nova, Vicenza (1578&amp;ndash;90) was designed by the influential Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio.|The emphatically classical church façade of [[Santa Maria Nova (Vicenza)|Santa Maria Nova]], [[Vicenza]] (1578&amp;ndash;90) was designed by the influential Renaissance architect [[Andrea Palladio]].]]
During the Italian renaissance and with the demise of Gothic style, major efforts were made by architects such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Sebastiano Serlio]] and [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]] to revive the language of architecture of first and foremost ancient Rome. This was done in part through the study of the ancient Roman architectural treatise ''[[De architectura]]'' by [[Vitruvius]], and to some extent by studying the actual remains of ancient Roman buildings in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Summerson| first1 = John| authorlink = | title = The Classical Language of Architecture | publisher = Thames and Hudson Ltd| series = | volume = | edition = | year = 1980| location = | pages = 7–8| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-500-20177-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the classical architecture of the Renaissance from the outset represents a highly specific interpretation of the classical ideas. In a building like the ''[[Ospedale degli Innocenti]]'' in [[Florence]] by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], one of the very earliest Renaissance buildings (built 1419&amp;ndash;45), the treatment of the columns for example has no direct antecedent in ancient Roman architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Pevsner| first1 = Nikolaus| authorlink = | title = An Outline of European Architecture | publisher = Penguin Books Ltd| series = | volume = | edition = 7| year = 1964| location = | pages = 177–178| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period, the study of ancient architecture developed into the architectural theory of classical architecture; somewhat over-simplified, one could say that classical architecture in its variety of forms ever since have been interpretations and elaborations of the architectural rules set down during antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Evers| first1 = Bernd| last2 = Thoenes| first2 = Christof| authorlink = | title = Architectural Theory from the Renaissance to the Present | publisher = Taschen| series = | volume = 1| edition = | year = 2011| location = | pages = 6–19| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-3-8365-3198-6 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the styles originating in post-[[renaissance]] [[Europe]] can be described as classical architecture. This broad use of the term is employed by Sir [[John Summerson]] in ''[[The Classical Language of Architecture]]''. The elements of classical architecture have been applied in radically different architectural contexts than those for which they were developed, however. For example, [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] or [[Rococo architecture#Architecture|Rococo architecture]] are styles which, although classical at root, display an architectural language very much in their own right. During these periods, architectural theory still referred to classical ideas but rather less sincerely than during the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fleming| first1 = John| last2 = Honour| first2 = Hugh| last3 = Pevsner| first3 = Nikolaus| authorlink = | title = Dictionary of architecture | publisher = Penguin Books Ltd | series = | volume = | edition = 3| year = 1986| location = | page = 76| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-14-051013-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a reaction to late baroque and rococo forms, architectural theorists from circa 1750 through what became known as [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]] again consciously and earnestly attempted to emulate antiquity, supported by recent developments in [[Classical archaeology]] and a desire for an architecture based on clear rules and rationality. [[Claude Perrault]], [[Marc-Antoine Laugier]] and [[Carlo Lodoli]] were among the first theorists of neoclassicism, while [[Étienne-Louis Boullée]], [[Claude Nicolas Ledoux]], [[Friedrich Gilly]] and [[John Soane]] were among the more radical and influential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fleming| first1 = John| last2 = Honour| first2 = Hugh| last3 = Pevsner| first3 = Nikolaus| authorlink = | title = Dictionary of architecture | publisher = Penguin Books Ltd | series = | volume = | edition = 3| year = 1986| location = | page = 76| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-14-051013-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neoclassical architecture held a particularly strong position on the architectural scene c. 1750&amp;ndash;1850. The competing [[Gothic Revival architecture|neo-Gothic style]] however rose to popularity during the early 1800s, and the later part the 19th century was characterised by a variety of styles, some of them only slightly or not at all related to classicism (such as [[Art Nouveau]]), and [[Eclecticism in architecture|eclecticism]]. Although classical architecture continued to play an important role and for periods of time at least locally dominated the architectural scene, as exemplified by the "[[Nordic Classicism]]" during the 1920s, classical architecture in its stricter form never regained its former dominance. With the advent of [[Modern architecture|Modernism]] during the early 20th century, classical architecture arguably almost completely ceased to be practised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Summerson| first1 = John| authorlink = | title = The Classical Language of Architecture | publisher = Thames and Hudson Ltd| series = | volume = | edition = | year = 1980| location = | page = 114| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-500-20177-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Glyptothek, Königsplatz, Múnich, Alemania02.JPG|thumb|right|alt=The Glyptothek in Munich, designed by architect Leon von Klenze and built 1816&amp;ndash;30, an example of Neoclassical architecture.|The [[Glyptothek]] in [[Munich]], designed by [[Leo von Klenze]] and built 1816&amp;ndash;30, an example of [[Neoclassical architecture]].]]

==Scope==
As noted above, classical styles of architecture dominated Western architecture for a very long time, roughly from the Renaissance until the advent of [[Modern architecture|Modernism]]. That is to say, that classical antiquity at least in theory was considered the prime source of inspiration for architectural endeavours in the West for much of [[Modern history]]. Even so, because of liberal, personal or theoretically diverse interpretations of the antique heritage, classicism covers a broad range of styles, some even so to speak cross-referencing, like [[Palladian architecture#Neo-Palladian|Neo-Palladian architecture]], which draws its inspiration from the works of Italian Renaissance architect [[Andrea Palladio]] &amp;mdash; who himself drew inspiration from ancient Roman architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fleming| first1 = John| last2 = Honour| first2 = Hugh| last3 = Pevsner| first3 = Nikolaus| authorlink = | title = Dictionary of architecture | publisher = Penguin Books Ltd | series = | volume = | edition = 3| year = 1986| location = | page = 234| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-14-051013-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it can even be argued (as noted above) that styles of architecture not typically considered classical, like Gothic, can be said to contain classical elements. Therefore, a simple delineation of the scope of classical architecture is difficult to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Summerson| first1 = John| authorlink = | title = The Classical Language of Architecture | publisher = Thames and Hudson Ltd| series = | volume = | edition = | year = 1980| location = | pages = 7–8| language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-500-20177-3 | mr = | zbl = | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more or less defining characteristic can still be said to be a reference to ancient Greek or Roman architecture, and the architectural rules or theories that derived from that architecture.

==Petrification==
In the grammar of architecture, the word ''petrification'' is often used when discussing the development of sacred structures, such as temples, mainly with reference to developments in the Greek world.  During the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and early [[Classical Greece|Classical]] periods (about the 6th and early 5th centuries BC), the architectural forms of the earliest temples had solidified and the [[Doric order|Doric]] emerged as the predominant element.  A widely accepted theory in classical studies is that the earliest temple structures were of wood and the great forms, or elements of architectural style, were codified and rather permanent by the time we see the Archaic emergent and established.  It was during this period, at different times and places in the Greek world, that the use of dressed and polished stone replaced the wood in these early temples, but the forms and shapes of the old wooden styles were retained, just as if the wooden structures had turned to stone, thus the designation ''petrification''&lt;ref&gt;Gagarin, Michael. The Oxford encyclopedia of ancient Greece and Rome. Vol. 1. Oxford [u.a.: Oxford Univ. Press, 2010. 210. {{ISBN|0195170725}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes "petrified carpentry"&lt;ref&gt;Watkin, David. A history of Western architecture. 4th ed. London: Laurence King, 2005. 25. {{ISBN|1856694593}}&lt;/ref&gt; for this process.

This careful preservation of the primitive wooden appearance in the stone fabric of the newer buildings was scrupulously observed and this suggests that it may have been dictated by religion rather than aesthetics, although the exact reasons are now lost in the mists of antiquity. And not everyone within the great reach of Mediterranean civilization made this transition.  The [[Etruscans]] in Italy were, from their earliest period, greatly influenced by their contact with Greek culture and religion, but they retained their wooden temples (with some exceptions) until their culture was completely absorbed into the Roman world, with the great wooden [[Temple of Jupiter (Capitoline Hill)|Temple of Jupiter]] on the Capitol in Rome itself being a good example.  Nor was it the lack of knowledge of stone working on their part that prevented them from making the transition from timber to dressed stone.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21513">In [[literary criticism]], '''close reading''' is the careful, sustained interpretation of a brief passage of a text.  A close reading emphasizes the single and the particular over the general, effected by close [[attention]] to individual words, the syntax, the order in which the sentences unfold ideas, as well as formal structures. A truly attentive close reading of a two-hundred-word poem might be thousands of words long without exhausting the possibilities for observation and insight.

== History ==
Literary close reading and commentaries have extensive precedent in the [[exegesis]] of religious texts, and more broadly, [[hermeneutics]] of ancient works. For example, [[Pazand]], a genre of [[middle Persian]] literature, refers to the ''Zend'' (literally: 'commentary'/'translation') texts that offer explanation and close reading of the [[Avesta]], the sacred texts of [[Zoroastrianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Avesta|last=Williams Jackson|first=A.V.|work=A Library of the World's Best Literature, Ancient and Modern,|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|year=2008|isbn=978-1-60520-191-7|editor-last=Warner|editor-first=Charles Dudley|volume=III|location=New York|pages=1084, 1086|orig-year=1896}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scriptural commentaries of the [[Talmud]] offer a commonly cited early predecessor to close reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/25832229|title=Hermeneutics, ancient and modern|last=L.|first=Bruns, Gerald|date=1992|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300054505|location=New Haven|oclc=25832229}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Islamic studies, the close reading of the [[Quran]] has flourished and produced an immense corpus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/browse/encyclopaedia-of-the-quran|title=Exegesis of the Qur'an: Early Modern and Contemporary|last=Wielandt|first=Rotraud|date=|editor-last=McAuliffe|editor-first=Jane Dammen|website=referenceworks.brillonline.com|type=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=10 August 2018|editor last name=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the closest religious analogy to contemporary literary close reading, and the principal historical connection with its birth, is the rise of the [[higher criticism]], and the evolution of [[textual criticism]] of the Bible in Germany in the late eighteenth century.

In the practice of literary studies, the technique of close reading emerged in 1920s Britain in the work of [[I. A. Richards]], his student [[William Empson]], and the poet [[T.S. Eliot]], all of whom sought to replace an "impressionistic" view of literature then dominant with what Richards called a "practical criticism" focused on language and form. American [[New Critics]] in the 1930s and 1940s anchored their views in similar fashion, and promoted close reading as a means of understanding that the autonomy of the work (often a poem) mattered more than anything else, including authorial intention, the cultural contexts of reception, and most broadly, ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13795373|title=Professing literature : an institutional history|last=Gerald,|first=Graff,|isbn=0226306038|location=Chicago|oclc=13795373}}&lt;/ref&gt;For these critics, including [[Cleanth Brooks]], [[John Crowe Ransom]], and [[Allen Tate]], only close reading, because of its attentiveness to the nuances and interrelation of language and form, could address the work in its complex unity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/297149196|title=American literary criticism since the 1930s|last=1944-|first=Leitch, Vincent B.,|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|others=Leitch, Vincent B., 1944-|isbn=0415778174|edition=2nd|location=London|oclc=297149196}}&lt;/ref&gt;Their influence on American literary criticism and English departments held sway for several decades, and even after New Criticism faded from prominence in American universities in the waning years of the Cold War, &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13795373|title=Professing literature : an institutional history|last=Gerald,|first=Graff,|publisher=|year=|isbn=0226306038|location=Chicago|page=227|pages=|oclc=13795373}}&lt;/ref&gt;close reading remained a fundamental, almost naturalized, skill amongst literary critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/10323916|title=The crisis in criticism : theory, literature, and reform in English studies|last=1952-|first=Cain, William E.,|date=1984|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|isbn=0801831911|location=Baltimore|oclc=10323916}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walhout|first=Mark|date=December 1987|title=The New Criticism and the Crisis of American Liberalism: The Poetics of the Cold War.|url=|journal=College English|volume=49|pages=861-871|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mao|first=Douglas|date=1996|title=The New Critics and the Text-Object|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/30030280|journal=ELH|volume=63|pages=227-254|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;By the turn of the 21st century, efforts to historicize New Critical aesthetics and its apolitical pretense prompted scholars, especially in departments of English, to debate the fate of close reading, asking about its status as a critical practice.

In two of its 2010 bulletins, the American Departments of English (ADE) featured a cluster of articles that attempted to take stock of what the 21st century held for close reading. The articles were motivated, as all of the scholars remarked, by the changes they had observed in the work of their colleagues and students -- as well as in contemporary culture -- that made them think again about why close reading mattered to the study of literature. Jonathan Culler noted that because the discipline had taken close reading for granted, it had disappeared from discussions of the goals of literary criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Culler|first=Jonathan|date=2012|title="The Closeness of Close Reading"|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1632/ade.152.0|journal=ADE Bulletin|volume=152|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1632/ade.152.0|issn=0001-0898|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;For Culler, as for Jane Gallop, that absence needed remedying, and therefore signaled an opportunity for departments of English to renew -- in order to capitalize on -- one of the more distinctive traits of studying literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2012|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1632/ade.152.0|journal=ADE Bulletin|volume=152|issue=1|doi=10.1632/ade.152.0|issn=0001-0898}}&lt;/ref&gt; If New Criticism and its isolationist stance had given away to the politicization of literary studies, and if technological developments were changing the very ways in which people read, Culler and Gallop emphasized that the signature of close reading, meticulous attention to the workings of language and form, still had value.N. Katherine Hayles and John Guillory, meanwhile, each interested in the impact of digital media on the ways people read, argued that close reading skills were not only translatable to the digital context, but could also exist productively alongside the hyper-reading that web interfaces and links had generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guillory|first=John|date=2012|title="Close Reading: Prologue and Epilogue"|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1632/ade.152.0|journal=ADE Bulletin|volume=152|issue=1|pages=|doi=10.1632/ade.152.0|issn=0001-0898|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hayles|first=N.

== Principles and Practice ==
While the New Criticism popularized close reading in universities, it tended to emphasize its principles and offer extended examples rather than prescribe specific methods and practices. This tendency towards what Vincent B. Leitch calls "canonical statements"&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/297149196|title=American literary criticism since the 1930s|last=1944-|first=Leitch, Vincent B.|date=2010|publisher=Routledge|others=Leitch, Vincent B., 1944-|isbn=0415778174|edition=2nd|location=London|oclc=297149196}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in essays and book-length studies, from John Crowe Ransom's "The New Criticism" (1949) and Allen Tate's "A Note on Autotelism" (1949), to Cleanth Brooks' ''[[The Well Wrought Urn]]'' (1947)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/4908303|title=The well wrought urn : studies in the structure of poetry|last=1906-1994.|first=Brooks, Cleanth,|date=1947|publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World|others=ברוקס, קליאנת', 1906-1994.|isbn=0156957051|location=New York|oclc=4908303}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Rene Wellek and Austin Warren's ''[[Theory of Literature]]'' (1949)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1944737|title=Theory of literature|last=René|first=Wellek|date=1956|publisher=Harcourt, Brace &amp; World|others=Warren, Austin, 1899-1986,|isbn=0156890844|edition=3d|location=New York,|oclc=1944737}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and W.K. Wimsatt's ''The Verbal Icon'' (1954).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/328522|title=The verbal icon : studies in the meaning of poetry|last=1907-1975.|first=Wimsatt, William K. (William Kurtz),|date=1954|publisher=University of Kentucky Press|isbn=0813101115|location=Lexington, Ky.|oclc=328522}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first ten chapters of ''The Well Wrought Urn'' thus focus individually on poems across British literary history (John Donne, William Shakespeare, John Milton, Alexander Pope, Thomas Gray, John Keats, William Wordsworth, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, W.B. Yeats, and T.S. Eliot) before concluding with "The Heresy of Paraphrase," in which Brooks abstracts the premises on which his analyses rest. Meanwhile, when Wellek and Warren describe their preference for an "intrinsic" study of literature in ''Theory of Literature'', they refer to examples of elements they claim are crucial to a work -- from euphony, rhythm, and meter to image, metaphor, and myth -- and cite concrete examples of these drawn from literary history, but do not indicate steps by which readers might translate such thinking into their own analyses. Wimsatt takes a mixed approach in ''The Verbal Icon'', combining theoretical chapters ("The Intentional Fallacy," "The Affective Fallacy") with those that discuss concerns he feels are necessary to the study of poetry ("The Concrete Universal," "Symbol and Metaphor," "The Substantive Level," "One Relation of Rhyme to Reason," "When is Variation 'Elegant'?","Verbal Style: Logical and Counterlogical"), but he too leaves it to his readers to imagine how they might deploy these views.

As Culler notes in his essay for the 2010 bulletin of the American Departments of English, this tendency not to make statements of method meant that most students of the New Critics learned by example. Thus in the New Critical classroom, "the charismatic pedagogue could pose a question you had not thought of about relations between form and meaning or point to a textual difficulty that had escaped your attention."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Culler|first=Jonathan|date=2012|title="The Closeness of Close Reading"|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1632/ade.152.0|journal=ADE Bulletin|volume=152|issue=1|pages=23|doi=10.1632/ade.152.0|issn=0001-0898|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than fifty years later, this "closeness of close reading" remains vital to the work of more recent thinkers whose thinking has contributed to the radical changes in literary studies and displaced New Criticism. Of these he cites his contemporary, the deconstructionist Barbara Johnson, who stands out for her claim that the value of close reading lies in its capacity for taking seriously what does not immediately make sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/65306717|title="Teaching Deconstructively"|last=Johnson|first=Barbara|date=1985|work=Writing and Reading Differently: Deconstruction and the Teaching of Composition and Literature|publisher=Univ. Press of Kansas|others=|year=1985|isbn=0700002839|editor-last=Atkins|editor-first=George Michael|location=Lawrence, Kansas|pages=140|oclc=65306717|editor-last2=Johnson|editor-first2=Michael L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;Well aware of the stark differences between New Criticism and deconstruction, Culler here brings the two together, suggesting that their shared investments indicate an understanding of close reading worth maintaining.

In French criticism, close reading is similar to ''[[explication de texte]]'', the tradition of textual interpretation in literary study, as proposed by [[Gustave Lanson]]. As an [[analytical technique]], ''close reading'' compares and contrasts the concept of ''distant reading'', the technique for “understanding literature, not by studying particular texts, but by aggregating and analyzing massive amounts of data”, as described, by Kathryn Schulz, in “What is Distant Reading?”, an article about the literary scholar [[Franco Moretti]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/26/books/review/the-mechanic-muse-what-is-distant-reading.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 "What is Distant Reading?" | New York Times article by Kathryn Schulz June 24, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Brooks's discussion of John Keats's "Ode to a Grecian Urn" embodies his use of close reading. In "Keats's Sylvan Historian," he finds the controversy over the poem's famous lines misplaced, and insists instead that "the ambiguity" of "Beauty is truth, truth beauty -- that is all/Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know" is best understood as an expression of the urn itself (151-153). The poem pursues this ambiguity, he writes, in lines that describe the urn on the one hand as a "bride of quietness" and a "foster-child of silence" and on the other, a "sylvan historian" (155). In this way the poem describes the urn in paradoxical terms much as the urn utters a paradoxical line. Brooks then pursues this logic by considering how "sylvan historian" might not only describe the urn as a kind of historian but also the kind of history the urn is said to tell. Further, if he claims that this history is uncertain because it's not clear "what men or gods" feature in it, he continues that line of thinking as he proceeds through the ode's stanzas: when he emphasizes that the "unheard melodies" of the figures depicted on the urn's face are "sweeter than any audible music," that "action goes on though the actors are motionless," that "the maiden, always to be kissed, never actually kissed," that the "boughs...cannot shed their leaves," and when he claims that this "ironic undercurrent" only increases over the course of the poem, to culminate in those infamous lines (156-159, 164). From following the poem in this way, Brooks arrives at the assertion that his interpretation is "derived from the context of the "Ode" itself" (164).

Brooks's close reading is typical of the New Critical investment in the textual object alone. Yet scholars have also found close reading productive for more politically and socially invested work, thereby refusing the New Critical belief in literary transcendence while seizing on the care with which it treated textuality. In ''The Madwoman in the Attic: The Woman Writer and the Nineteenth-Century Literary Imagination'' (1979), best known as one of the earliest statements of feminist literary criticism, Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar deployed close reading to make a case for the distinctiveness of the female literary imagination. The sixteen chapters of ''Madwoman'' thus pursue their arguments -- that women writers expressed their anxiety about authorship, their rage over being constrained to docile femininity, their canny encoding of their patriarchal critique -- with the attention to language, imagery, and form Gilbert and Gubar had been trained to wield as graduate students in the late 1960s. New Critical echoes are thus evident in the individual chapters devoted to close readings of Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein'', Emily Bronte's ''Wuthering Heights'', Charlotte Bronte's ''The Professor'', ''Jane'' ''Eyre'', ''Shirley'', and ''Villette'', but so is the political innovation. Reviewers -- academic and mainstream -- recognized this trait, describing the two scholars as “gnostic heretics who claim to have found the secret code that unlocks the mysteries in old texts” (Schreiber 11)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schreiber|first=Le Anne|date=December 9, 1979|title="I'm Nobody, Who Are You?"|url=|journal=The New York Times Review of Books|volume=|pages=11, 32-3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;and their interpretations as a "skillful joint peeling away of the layers" of women's writing" (129).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolodny|first=Annette|date=March 1980|title=Rev. of The Madwoman in the Attic|url=|journal=American Literature|volume=52.1|pages=128-132|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an even more extreme example, [[Jacques Derrida]] in ''Ulysses Gramophone'' devotes more than eighty pages to the word "yes" in James Joyce's novel ''Ulysses'', an effort which [[J. Hillis Miller]] describes as a "hyperbolic, extravagant... explosion" of the technique of close reading.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, J. Hillis, "Derrida and literature" in ''Jacques Derrida and the Humanities: A Critical Reader'', Tom Cohen, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching close reading ==
The push for more close-reading instruction in primary and secondary education is partially due to increased feedback from college professors in the early-mid 2000s that students were arriving in university classrooms with few comprehension skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/dec12/vol70/num04/Closing-in-on-Close-Reading.aspx|title=Closing in on Close Reading - Educational Leadership|last=ASCD|website=www.ascd.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increased demand for students to acquire concrete skills in high school that they would need in transitioning to higher education and to adult life culminated in the creation of the [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core State Standards]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corestandards.org/about-the-standards/|title=About the Standards {{!}} Common Core State Standards Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=www.corestandards.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, there has been a push for English Language Arts teachers, especially at the secondary level, to help students develop close-reading strategies. Several of the English Language Arts (ELA) Standards for Reading Literature require students to be able to cite direct textual evidence, and to analyze words in context. For example, CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.9-10.4 asks students to "Determine the meaning of words and phrases as they are used in the text, including figurative and connotative meanings; analyze the cumulative impact of specific word choices on meaning and tone (e.g., how the language evokes a sense of time and place; how it sets a formal or informal tone)."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corestandards.org/ELA-Literacy/RL/9-10/|title=English Language Arts Standards » Reading: Literature » Grade 9-10 {{!}} Common Core State Standards Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=www.corestandards.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategies ===
Today, as most states have adopted the Common Core Standards,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.corestandards.org/standards-in-your-state/|title=Standards in Your State {{!}} Common Core State Standards Initiative|last=|first=|date=|website=www.corestandards.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is an increasing number of resources designed to help teachers instruct and implement close-reading strategies in their classrooms. In 2012, Kylene Beers and Robert E. Probst published ''Notice &amp; Note: Strategies for Close Reading'', which established six "signposts" that alert readers to significant moments in a work of literature and encourage students to read closely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.heinemann.com/shared/onlineresources/e04693/noticenote_flyer.pdf|title=Notice &amp; Note: Strategies for Close Reading|last=Beers|first=Kylene|date=|website=Heinemann|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another resource, developed by Beth Burke ([[National Board Certified Teacher|NBCT]]) for the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'' NIE (Newspaper in Education), presents the steps involved in close reading and how to [[Lev Vygotsky|scaffold]] the strategies for students. She recommends using the Gradual Release Model&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nieonline.com/tbtimes/downloads/CCSS_reading.pdf|title=Closing in on Close Reading|last=Burke|first=Beth|date=|website=Tampa Bay Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in instruction, beginning by modeling a close reading in front of the class, then having students work on the strategy in groups before attempting it alone. 

Additional ways to support students in close-reading instruction include providing [[Graphic organizer|graphic organizers]] that help them group their ideas with textual evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://edu.wyoming.gov/downloads/assessments/2014/close-reading-graphic-organizer.pdf|title=Close Reading Graphic Organizer|last=|first=|date=|website=State of Wyoming|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''codebook''' is a type of document used for gathering and storing codes. Originally codebooks were often literally [[books|&lt;span lang="en-us" dir="ltr"&gt;books&lt;/span&gt;]], but today codebook is a byword for the complete record of a series of codes, regardless of physical format.

==Cryptography==
In [[cryptography]], a codebook is a document used for implementing a [[code (cryptography)|code]]. A codebook contains a [[lookup table]] for coding and decoding; each word or phrase has one or more strings which replace it. To decipher messages written in code, corresponding copies of the codebook must be available at either end. The distribution and [[physical security]] of codebooks presents a special difficulty in the use of codes, compared to the secret information used in [[cipher]]s, the [[cryptographic key|key]], which is typically much shorter.

The United States [[National Security Agency]] documents sometimes use ''codebook'' to refer to [[block cipher]]s; compare their use of ''combiner-type algorithm'' to refer to [[stream cipher]]s.

A codebook is usually made in two parts, one part being for converting plaintext to ciphertext, the other for the opposite purpose. Both are usually organized similar to a standard dictionary, with plaintext words (in the first part) and ciphertext words (in the second part) presented like dictionary headwords.

The book used in a [[book cipher]] or the book used in a [[running key cipher]] is generally not a cryptographic codebook.

==Social sciences==
In social sciences, a codebook is a document containing list of codes used in research.

==Data compression==
Codebooks were also used in 19th- and 20th-century [[Commercial code (communications)|commercial codes]] for the non-cryptographic purpose of data compression.

{{wiktionary}}
'''Comic relief''' is the inclusion of a [[humour|humorous]] character, scene, or witty dialogue in an otherwise serious work, often to relieve tension.

==Definition==
Comic relief usually means a releasing of emotional or other tension resulting from a comic episode interposed in the midst of serious or tragic elements in a drama. Comic relief often takes the form of a bumbling, [[wikt:wisecrack|wisecrack]]ing [[sidekick]] of the [[hero]] or [[villain]] in a work of fiction. A sidekick used for comic relief will usually comment on the absurdity of the [[hero]]'s situation and make comments that would be inappropriate for a character who is to be taken seriously. Other characters may use comic relief as a means to irritate others or keep themselves confident.

==Use==
Sometimes comic relief characters will appear in fiction that is [[comic]]. This generally occurs when the work enters a [[drama]]tic moment, but the character continues to be comical  regardless.
[[Greek tragedy]] did not allow any comic relief within the drama,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.allexperts.com/q/European-History-670/Greek-Tragedy-English-Tragedy.htm|title=Greek Tragedy and English Tragedy|last=Rutherford|first=Sam|accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; but had a tradition of concluding a series of several tragic performances with a humorous [[satyr play]]. Even the Elizabethan critic Sidney following [[Horace]]’s ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' pleaded for the exclusion of  comic elements  from a tragic  drama. But in the Renaissance England Marlowe among the [[University Wits]] introduced comic relief through  the presentation of crude scenes in Doctor Faustus following the native tradition of Interlude which was usually introduced between two tragic plays. In fact, in the classical tradition the mingling of the tragic and the comic was not allowed.

==Examples==
[[William Shakespeare]] deviated from the classical tradition and used comic relief in ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Macbeth]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' and ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''. The Porter scene in ''Macbeth'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tromly |first=Frederic B.|date=Spring 1975|title=Macbeth and His Porter |journal=Shakespeare Quarterly|volume=26|issue=2|pages=151–156|doi=10.2307/2869244|publisher=Folger Shakespeare Library|jstor=2869244}}&lt;/ref&gt; the grave-digger scene in ''Hamlet'' and the gulling of Roderigo provide immense comic relief. The mockery of the fool in ''[[King Lear]]'' may also be regarded as a comic relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Draudt|first=Manfred|year=2002|title=The Comedy of Hamlet|journal=Atlantis|volume=24|issue=2|pages=85–107|issn=0210-6124|url=http://www.atlantisjournal.org/Papers/24_1/draudt.pdf|accessdate=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24708">Objects used in Jewish rituals are known collectively as [[Judaica]]. The '''conservation and restoration of Judaica''' takes into account the collective body of Jewish religious laws derived from the written and oral [[Torah]] known as, [[halacha]] in order to properly care for these materials. This work involves identifying these objects and therefore knowing how any of these objects are traditionally handled, stored, exhibited, and generally cared for based on their use and significance. 

==Definition of culturally sensitive objects==
Traditional [[Judaism]] divides ritual objects into two main categories, those that carry holiness; and those that are essential to the performance of a particular ritual or commandment but that have no intrinsic quality that is defined as sacred or holy. Once they are no longer in ritual use and are in the possession of a museum, only some of the objects in the first category are traditionally treated differently from the way other collections are treated. For these pieces, repair or restoration done by a conservator is not common. It is common for almost all other objects, conservation, repair, or restoration to be carried out without restriction.&lt;ref name="Defining"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greene|first1=Virginia|title=Accessories of Holiness: Defining Jewish Sacred Objects|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic31-01-005.html||website=cool.conservation-us.org|accessdate=9 April 2017|date=January 1, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way the objects below are handled and preventatively conserved is all based on the laws and thoughts of the most strict sect of Judaism as is recommended.

Below is a list of both types of objects with definitions and descriptions to aid in identifying and therefore knowing how any of these objects might be handled and cared for due to their uses and significance. Additionally, these descriptions will aid in understanding the care and handling methods listed below them. 

References are made to [[Ashkenazi]], [[Sephardi]], and [[Mizrachi Jews]] in this article. Ashkenazi Jews trace their ancestry to communities in central and eastern Europe while Sephardi Jews are those who came originally from the Iberian Peninsula. These Jews were expelled in 1492 during the Spanish Inquisition and settled in places like Greece, Turkey, and what is known as Israel today. Mizrachi Jews are those who trace their ancestry to the Arab world and Iran, as well as those whose families never left Palestine.&lt;ref name=Virtual /&gt;

===Types of sacred and non-sacred objects===
Tashmishey Kedushah is the first category of ritual objects and is defined as "objects which carry holiness" or "accessories of holiness." The most common example of this is the [[Torah]] which is the Five Books of Moses.&lt;ref name=Defining/&gt;  [[File:Open Torah scroll.jpg|thumb|Open Torah scroll]]

The common feature of the objects in this group is that they contain words, specifically the name of God, but by extension, any words "divinely written" or inspired, from which the quality of holiness is derived. Because the nontextual objects surrounding these scrolls all come into contact with them, they also acquire some of the same quality of holiness. The transmission is not indefinite. It extends a maximum of two layers from the text.

Other objects in this category include:
* Torah curtains - Curtains that are in front of the Torah ark and are often decorative in nature but can also be plain. 
* Mantle - A piece of fabric often used to cover a Torah scroll and often made of velvet or another soft material with some type of embroidery. This is used most often by Ashkenazi communities.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;
* Torah binder - A strip of soft fabric, similar to the mantle, that keeps the Torah scroll closed.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt; In Italy and in the Sephardi communities, the binder is known as a "fascia"; it is made of a costly material or of linen embroidered in silk thread.&lt;ref name="Virtual"&gt;{{cite web|title=Torah Ornaments|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/torah-ornaments|website=Jewish Virtual Library: A Project of AICE|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Rimonim - Silver and gold ornaments that are placed on the wooden rollers or in Hebrew, "atzei chaim" (trees of life). Many times these are adorned with little bells and are very intricate.&lt;ref name="Learning"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shekel|first1=Michal|title=The Making of a Torah Scroll|url=http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/torah-scroll/|website=My Jewish Learning|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Breastplate - A metal shield placed in front of the mantle of the Torah scroll in Ashkenazi communities. This custom did not develop in Sephardi communities because their Torah scrolls were kept in a case (tik)  which did not lend itself to such additional decoration. Symbolic of, and sometimes similar to, the breastplate prescribed for the high priest, the object is often called "ḥoshen mishpat," the Hebrew word for breastplate.&lt;ref name=Virtual /&gt;
* [[Yad]] - The pointer used by the Torah reader to keep one's place is known as a "yad," in Hebrew, or "hand" in English, in Ashkenazi communities and as the "moreh" or "pointer/teacher" or "Kulmus" or "quill" in Sephardi and Eastern communities. The pointer was originally a narrow rod, tapered at the pointing end, usually with a hole at the other end through which a ring or chain could be passed to hang the pointer on the Torah scroll. Now it looks like a hand with one finger pointing out. This is used so that no hands touch the actual scroll and transfer oils or dirt. Pointers are made for the most part of silver or silver-plated brass, but in a few European communities, they used to be made of wood. In such cases, the pointers were carved in the local folk-art style.&lt;ref name=Virtual /&gt;
* Wood Torah case - Used by Sephardic Jews instead of a fabric mantle allowing the Torah to sit upright when not in use and without the use of a chair or holder as mentioned above. [[File:ShinMezuzahJosephSherman.jpg|thumb|ShinMezuzahJosephSherman]] &lt;ref name="Sephardim"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shurpin|first1=Yehuda|title=Why Do Sephardim Keep Their Torahs in Cylindrical Cases|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3119530/jewish/Why-Do-Sephardim-Keep-Their-Torahs-in-Cylindrical-Cases.htm|website=Chabad.org|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Chair or holder on which the Torah is placed when it is removed from the ark and not being read. 
* [[Tefillin]]  - Known in English as “phylacteries,” are worn by men in the Orthodox and Conservative movement during morning prayer and on weekdays. This includes a leather case, the biblical texts written on parchment that is inside, the leather straps used to fasten them to the head and arm during prayer (see image of soldier below), and any bag specifically made to hold them and used for that purpose on a regular basis. 
*[[Mezuzah]] - A metal, ceramic, or glass casing in which the handwritten text on parchment or "[[klaf]]" in Hebrew, is held. This object is fastened to the doorpost of a house and, traditionally, to interior doorways as well and marks the home of a Jewish family. 

Bibles, prayer books, volumes of the [[Talmud]], law codes, and commentaries, in a variety of languages, are now also included in this list. In some communities, any document of any kind written in Hebrew letters is also included. This can sometimes also include anything written in [[Yiddish]] which uses the same alphabet.

====Tashmishey Mitzvah====
Tashminey Mitzvah is a category that includes most other ritual objects essential to Jewish life.  Objects include:
*Wine or [[kiddush]] cups used on Sabbath and holidays 
*[[Hanukkah]] [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]] 
*[[Seder plate]] 
*[[Shofar]] 
*[[Tallit]] with knotted fringes, called [[tzitzit]].
*[[Lulav]] or a palm branch in English, tied together with willow and myrtle and [[etrog]] (citron) to be used on the Jewish harvest holiday of [[Sukkot]], 
*[[Etrog]] containers - That keep the etrog safe from the "pitam" or "pitom" breaking off making the fruit less valuable and possibly not kosher. 
*Sabbath candlesticks - Used weekly during [[Shabbat]]
*Spice box and candle holder used for the [[Havdalah]] service that marks the end of the Jewish Sabbath, called [[Shabbat]]. 
*[[Challah]] and [[matzah]] covers - Used to cover bread for Shabbat and the holiday of Passover which tells the story of the exodus from Egypt. 
*[[Chuppah]] - or wedding canopy in English

==Preventative conservation ==
Once holy/sacred objects (tashmishey kedusha) leave the Jewish community and enter the care of a museum, it is common practice that this group of objects is divided into two sections. The first section contains the three written texts including the Torah scroll, tefillin, and klaf for the mezuza. (These all are, or contain, biblical texts that were handwritten on parchment, in a particular script, according to rigid rules, by men who are specially trained as scribes (sofrim)). The second section includes all other material, including printed or handwritten documents, Torah mantles, ark curtains, tefillin bags, Torah ornaments, and mezuza cases (see other section below).

In terms of preventative conservation and conservation itself, Torah scrolls, tefillin, and mezuza scrolls traditionally are left as they are. According to [[halacha]], once they are no longer in use, there is no reason for them to be kosher—in proper condition to be used—and therefore no reason why missing or abraded letters are restored or minor repairs made to the parchment unless the museum wishes to do as they see it necessary for the safety of the object. 

The repair of other books and documents has often been done with the respect that would characterize any professional conservation treatment. In Judaism, the study of traditional texts is considered to be the equivalent of prayer. To restore any text, whether of aesthetic or historical value or not, to a state in which it can be studied is considered an act of merit whatever the religious or cultural affiliation of the person doing the work. This includes when it will just be on view in an exhibition.

===Torah, Klaf===
If, for the safety of a Torah scroll, it is determined that repairs must be done to the rollers on which the scroll is mounted, traditionally, these repairs are done by a scribe, who will then remounts the parchment onto the roller in the traditional manner. It has been proven that a Torah scroll that has a tear in the parchment does best when it is kept rolled to another part of the scroll. According to tradition, if two pages are separated the two parts of the scroll are most often wrapped and stored separately. If it is considered both possible (considering the condition of the parchment) and essential to rejoin the separated leaves.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

When Torah scrolls, prayer books, or volumes of the [[Talmud]] are in the possession of a Jewish institution, it is a common practice to only photograph (or making photocopies) of open scrolls or pages only for serious study or publication. Once the books and other documents are in an archive, or museum, the rules of the institution apply. These rules are usually based on condition and value, but restrictions on casual copying do exist in all cases.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

===Tefillin - phylacteries===
[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|IDF soldier put on tefillin]] 
It is against halacha to open tefillin unless it is necessary. According to Jewish tradition, the removal and examination of the klaf within the tefillin only occurs when the tefillin are being repaired. The style of the writing can give clues to the registrar or conservator to the time and place in which they were written. Many institutions exhibit tefillin in damaged condition if there is a special reason such as its association with a famous person, or in an exhibit of Holocaust-related material.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

===Other materials===
Objects in this group are commonly treated by any qualified conservator who will treat Jewish ritual material as anthropological material rather than as art, keeping conservation treatment to a minimum, and avoiding extensive restoration. Any ethical treatment is seen as permitted. It is noted that Conservators in private practice, who may not have the option of minimal treatment, may take on greater responsibility as a result of the above. Original fabric or trimming removed from an ark curtain have traditionally given to the owner for proper disposal. If the owner is unwilling to do this is it common for the responsibility to fall on the conservator to make other arrangements.  

===Holocaust related objects===
Alterations of any kind to an object that survived the Holocaust, unless absolutely necessary to ensure its physical survival, are not made out of respect for the victims. Conservators and collections staff traditionally attempt to do the least amount of conservation on an object from the Holocaust as the damaged state is part of what is seen as telling of the history of the object. Any intervention can be seen as causing a loss of historic and perhaps even esthetic information, and the greater the intervention the greater the damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rozdeba|first1=Suzzane|title=Uncertain Future|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/76089/uncertain-future|website=Tablet Magazine Online|accessdate=3 April 2017|date=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At Holocaust museums and other museums carrying objects from concentration camps including fragile items like prisoners’ artwork and thousands of documents, shoes, and suitcases, teeth, hair, glasses, luggage, and more, preservation is viewed as an ethical and practical issue. Conservators and registrars alike wrestle with questions about the proper role of restoration. It has been noted that people coming to see these objects don't want to see a replica of how something might have once looked, but they are looking for what it looks like because of what it, and what its owner, went through.&lt;ref name="Holocaust"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sevy|first1=Dr. Rivka|title=Ethics in Conservation of Original Materials|url=https://ehri-project.eu/ethics-conservation-original-materials|website=ehri-project.eu|publisher=European Holocaust Research Infrastructure|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concentration camps themselves are also considered artifacts to be to preserved as close to how they originally looked while still conserving them. This includes the barracks and other buildings that are exposed to natural conditions like atmosphere, rain, cold, etc. When Auschwitz was liberated by the Soviet army in January 1945, it covered 40 square kilometers, with three camps, sub camps, and an additional area that was supervised by SS administration. While some were hesitant to leave the camp as it was because of difficult memories, it was upon the request of former prisoners that the local government keep the former concentration camp intact as a memorial and the Polish government began initiatives to preserve the site, giving the Ministry of Culture and Art the authority to preserve parts of it.&lt;ref name=Holocaust /&gt;

Alternatively, the conservation of audio or visual records (photographs, films, voice records) is different. The audio or visual recordings of past historical events that are caught as images or sound are not the original as there is no physical original. Because they are the only remaining representation of the events of the holocaust, such as the Nazi Book burnings in the Opernplatz in Berlin,  this media is commonly conserved as much as possible.&lt;ref name=Holocaust /&gt;

==Overarching ethical concerns==
Because of certain rules, restrictions, and traditions within the Jewish religion, certain ethical concerns are commonly top-of-mind when caring for sacred Judaica. 

===Kohen restriction===
Many restrictions were designed to maintain what is referred to as ritual purity for Jews who are of the "Priest" holy order in the Temple of Jerusalem. Today, most Jews will know if they come from that [[Kohen]] line, and one might be able to tell from the last name of Cohen, Kohn, Kahn, etc. Many of the laws and practices are still maintained in traditional Judaism. One law that might affect the conservation of objects is that Kohanim are forbidden to be in contact with dead bodies, or be under the same roof as a corpse or any part of one, except in the case of the death of a close relative. This could prevent a conservator or registrar (doing preventative conservation) from caring for objects that are of the human remain nature, but only if it bothers the professional because of his or her background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rozovsky|first1=Lorne|title=Raise Your Hand if You're A Kohen|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/762109/jewish/Raise-Your-Hand-If-Youre-A-Kohen.htm|website=Chabad.org|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Menstruation and women touching objects===
It is the practice in some ultra-orthodox sects of Judaism that women who are menstruating do not touch any sacred texts for purity reasons. This is only a custom and is not written into Jewish law. Because of this, female conservators are able to work with the texts but remain cognizant of this custom. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Berkovitz|first1=Rahel|title=Can Women Touch the Torah? A Halackic View|url=https://www.jofa.org/Education/TorahTouching|website=Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance|accessdate=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Placement of sacred texts and objects on the floor===
Materials containing: (a) God's name, (b) Three consecutive words of a biblical verse, when written on one line with the intent to quote the verse, or (c) Other written or printed Torah ideas or laws are considered to be holy and, according to Jewish law, are not placed on the floor for any reason. Schoolwork, homework and test papers may be included in this category if they contain any of the above. All these materials are considered holy objects whether they are in Hebrew or another language, in Braille, or on microfilm.&lt;ref name="Chabad"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Posner|first1=Menachem|title=Proper Disposal of Holy Objects|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/475304/jewish/Proper-Disposal-of-Holy-Objects.htm%20Chabad.org|website=Chabad.org|accessdate=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stacking of sacred texts===
Additionally, any materials with God's name are not, according to halacha, stacked one on top of the other in any type of museum storage. Many consider this to be disrespectful to the holy objects.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==Exhibition and storage==
While there are few restrictions on the exhibition of Jewish ritual objects and generally none on the examination of this material for purposes of study by anyone of any religion or culture, it is important to mention the exceptions below.

It has been proven that Torah scrolls, tefillin, and mezuza scrolls do best if exhibited in an unrolled fashion unless they are deemed no longer fit for ritual use. These objects are generally stored covered with plain cloth or tissue paper in a dark drawer or cabinet and are separated from their holders if a conservator or registrar feels it is unwise to leave them in the same place. A reason for this is if the mantle is deemed unfit to stay on the Torah scroll. It is common practice for a Tefillin that needs to be separated from its bag to be kept in a plain cloth bag for storage. Small Torah scrolls are commonly stored lying down while large ones are kept upright on a rack specifically made to hold their weight.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

Mezuzah scrolls are traditionally kept in their cases or wrapped in tissue.

===Handling and long-term care===
Generally, when taken out for any reason, such as to be examined by a researcher, tashmishey kedusha is treated with respect as any object that is still being used in rituals. The surface on which the objects are placed is covered with a clean cloth or appropriate non-acidic paper, and the objects are covered when not being examined. Any scrolls being examined are re-rolled up when not in use.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

It has been proven that if the parchment is in good enough condition, it's best for the preservation of Torah scrolls and other rolled documents to be completely rolled front to back (or vice versa) and back to the center, once every year or two. This is most commonly done by two people who are experienced in this procedure and under the supervision of a conservator.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt;

==Conservation and restoration==
In many Jewish institutions, if it is decided that an object has reached the point of needing conservation, a [[registrar (museum)|museum registrar]] will connect a conservator with an expert in the type of object or in the Judaica field. This pairing of Rabbi with a [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]], a religious expert with conservator, or a professor with conservator, is known to creates a more trustworthy situation where the Museum does not have to worry that all Jewish rules are followed. If the conservator has any questions on process, or on what to do and not do, he or she can refer to the assigned expert. 

Instead of contacting a conservator if there are issues with a Torah, specifically involving the writing on the parchment, a registrar or curator will traditionally connect with a [[Sofer Stam]], or a scribe in English. This expert is trained in transcribing the Torah, tefillin, and mezuzahs, and other religious writings. According to Jewish law, or halacha, they are the only people allowed to touch these texts.  Scribes also assemble the Torah scrolls, sewing the sheets of parchment together and mounting them on the rollers, and make the cases for tefillin.&lt;ref name="Strassfeld"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Siegel|first1=R.|last2=Strassfeld|first2=M.|last3=Strassfeld|first3=S.|title=The Jewish Catalogue|date=1973|publisher=Jewish Publication Society|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==De-accessioning==
When it comes to the deaccessioning process of museum objects that a conservator or other museum professional deems beyond repair, these said objects can be disposed of through destruction. They will be destroyed by the curator or his/her designee. When it comes to disposal of Judaica, there are different rules depending on whether the object is deemed still holy or longer holy and whether they are fit for ritual use, or not fit for ritual use. 

===Holy/sacred objects (Tashmishey Kedushah)===
If collections professionals have artifacts that are holy Jewish objects containing the name of God (tashmishey kedusha) that have been determined to be beyond conservation and the museum no longer wants them in the collection and would otherwise dispose of them, this is, according to halacha, not allowed. Jewish law instructs how these types of objects are to be "put away"  (O.H. 154.3; Mishneh Torah, II 10.3). 

Traditionally, Ashkenazi Jews fulfill this requirement of "putting away" a holy object through burial, either in a specific part of a Jewish cemetery or, in some places, next to or along with a man of exceptional piety and learning.

Many Sephardic/Mizrachi Jewish communities put these objects instead into a special room in the synagogue, called a [[geniza]] (from the root meaning “conceal,” “hide,” or “preserve”). Because this group of objects includes books that are both handwritten and printed, documents, and traditional items, the storage rooms can get quite full.&lt;ref name=Defining /&gt; The most famous geniza is in the Ezra Synagogue in Cairo. It held more than 200,000 pages, some dating to the founding of the synagogue in 882.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Judaica|date=1971|publisher=Keter Publishing House.|location=Jerusalem, Israel|accessdate=25 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non Holy/sacred objects (Tashmishey Mitzvah)===
For the most part, objects that fall under tashmishey mitzvah are discarded when they are no longer fit for ritual use. This is because they have no intrinsic quality of holiness. even though they have value when it comes to Western aesthetics of beauty. One exception to this law is the [[tallit]]. The Shulchan Arukh, a medieval law code (first published 1565) and still considered authoritative by traditional Jews, states that [[tzitzit]], the strings that hang from a tallit are just as holy as the tallit itself and is treated as such.

Hal Leonard. {{ISBN|9781476867052}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A cue may also function as a guideline for another instrument for [[musical improvisation]] or if there are many bars rest to help the performer find where to come in.

"Cue notes may be given as guidance only, to assist a performer's entrance after numerous measures of rest....[Their size, and all elements associated with them] is somewhat smaller than normal note size, but still large enough to be legible (65-75% of normal note size)."&lt;ref&gt;Gerou, Tom &amp; Lusk, Linda (1996). ''Essential Dictionary of Music Notation'', p.119. Alfred Music Publishing. {{ISBN|9781457410710}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cued instrument is indicated with text and the cue notes are smaller than the rest. The [[stem (music)|stems]] of cue notes all go in the same direction and cue notes are [[transposing instrument|transposed]] into the key of the part entering.&lt;ref name="McGrain"/&gt;

== Other definitions ==

There are also passages in certain scores where there is an indication above a line of notes saying "cue notes" or simply "cue", but this indication does not have anything to do with the "cue notes" explained above. Opposed to these, these "cue notes" are more like alternative notes, which can either be played or not played, depending on the conductor's decision. This practice is particularly common in recordings of orchestral film music, where they often like to try out several orchestral colors and weightings in just one recording session and therefore use cued passages to try out other options.

'''''Die Musik''''' was a German music [[magazine]] established in 1901 by Bernhard Schuster (1870–1934). It was published semimonthly by Schuster &amp; Loeffler from Berlin and Leipzig. Schuster was its [[editor-in-chief]] from inception until July 1933, when the publication was taken over by the [[Third Reich]]. The final publication, under the name ''Die Musik,'' was February 1943.&lt;ref name="Sieb's dissertation" /&gt;

== History ==
First published in 1901, ''Die Musik'' ran semimonthly through September 1915, suspended publication due to [[World War I]]. In 1922, the publisher, Schuster &amp; Loeffler, merged with the Stuttgart firm [[Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt]] [[:de:Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt|(de)]]; and in October 1922, ''Die Musik'' (Vol. 25, Issue 1) resumed with Schuster as editor. A leaflet attached to the June 1933 issue marked its beginning as the official music journal of the [[Nazi Party]].&lt;ref name="Roberge" /&gt; The publication continued through 1943, changing its name in 1943 to ''Musik im Kriege'' ''(Music in War)'' and continued through 1944.

''Die Musik'' was the first German magazine to publish special issues called "Sonderhefte" — ''Wagner-Heft,'' February 1902. By 1932, ''Die Musik'' had published 120 special issues. Schuster stated that the 14 Beethoven and 15 Wagner issues equated to 8 to 10 yearbooks.&lt;ref name="Roberge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Publisher's music library" /&gt;

According to essayist Stephen W. Brown, ''Die Musik'' was the most successful music periodical in Germany because it targeted readership, from laypeople, to musicians, to scholars. Brown commented that ''Die Musik'' was remarkable for its variety and attention to jazz, but was silenced for political reasons in 1934. Its importance in musicology is significant, especially considering, according to Brown, that the dominant periodicals for musicology of that era were German.&lt;ref name="Brown: Journal Essay" /&gt;

=== History during the Third Reich ===
According to the thesis of book by Erik Levi — ''Mozart and the Nazis: How the Third Reich Abused a Cultural Icon'' — the [[Third Reich]] embraced the artistic heritage as its domain.&lt;ref name="Levi" /&gt; Because ''Die Musik'' was the most prestigious German-language music magazine of the first half of the twentieth century, the [[Third Reich]] took a special interest in requisitioned as the offician bulletin of the [[Reichsjugendführer|RJF]].

In its new role, ''Die Musik'' spearheaded several Nazi initiatives, including one called "Organ des Amtes für Kunstpflege beim Beauftragten des Führers für die gesamte geistige und weltanschauliche Schulung der NSDAP", commonly known as "[[Amt Rosenberg]]".&lt;ref name="Roberge" /&gt;

=== Editors during the Third Reich ===
''Die Musik,'' under the editorship of Schuster, had been relatively apolitical. The editors during the [[Third Reich]] were Johannes Gunther (born 1901), Friedrich W. Herzog (born 1902–1976), and [[Herbert Gerigk]]. Schuster had been editor until July 1933. Gunther, of the [[Reichsjugendführer]], became editor in August 1933. On April 1, 1934, ''Die Musik'' became the official bulletin of the [[Reichsjugendführer]]. Herzog, one of 88 German writers who signed the "[[Gelöbnis treuester Gefolgschaft]]", a pledge of allegiance to Hitler, became editor on July 1, 1934. [[Herbert Gerigk|Gerigk]], of the [[Reichsjugendführer]], was a chief collaborator in the Nazi music administration. Among other things, he co-authored the antisemitic ''[[Encyclopedia of Jews in Music|Lexikon der Juden in der Musik]]'' in 1941.&lt;ref name="Gerigk" /&gt; From September 1936 to June 1937, ''Die Musik'' was the official bulletin of the [[Militant League for German Culture]]. In October 1937, ''Die Musik'' became the official musical voice of the Department for Art Preservation under Reich leader [[Amt Rosenberg|Rosenberg]].&lt;ref name="Sieb's dissertation" /&gt;

In March 1943, ''Die Musik'' merged with ''Zeitschrift für Musik,'' ''Allgemeine Musikzeitung,'' and ''Neues Musikblatt'' to form ''[[Musik im Kriege]]'' ''[[:de:Musik im Kriege|(de)]],'' which resumed under its new name for the April/May 1943 issue with [[Herbert Gerigk|Gerigk]] as editor-in-chief.&lt;ref name="Roberge" /&gt;

'''Eugen Ehrlich''' (14 September 1862 – 2 May 1922) was an [[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] [[law (academic)|legal scholar]] and [[sociologist]] of law. He is widely regarded as one of the primary founders of the modern field of [[sociology of law]].

==Biography==
Ehrlich was born in Chernivtsi (now [[Chernivtsi]]) in the [[Duchy of Bukovina]], at that time a province of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian empire]]. Ehrlich studied law in Vienna, where he taught and practised as a lawyer before returning to Czernowitz to teach at the university there, a bastion of Germanic culture at the eastern edge of the Empire.

Ehrlich remained there for the rest of his teaching career and was Rector of the University in 1906–7. During the turmoil of World War I, when Czernowitz was occupied several times by Russian forces, he moved to Switzerland. After the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the ceding of the Bukovina to Romania, Ehrlich planned to return to Czernowitz, where he would have been required to teach in Romanian, but he died of diabetes in Vienna, [[First Austrian Republic|Austria]] in 1922.

Ehrlich's experience of the Bukovina's legal culture, where [[Austrian law]] and sharply contrasting local custom seemed to co-exist, caused him to question the hierarchical notions of law propounded by such theorists as [[Hans Kelsen]]. Ehrlich noted that legal theories that recognized law only as a sum of statutes and court decisions gave an inadequate view of the legal reality of a community. He drew a distinction between norms for decision and social norms or norms of conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, E. ([1913] 2001). ''Fundamental Principles of the Sociology of Law.'' Transaction Publishers, New Brunswick.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter actually govern the life of a society and, under certain conditions, can justifiably be regarded in popular consciousness, if not necessarily by lawyers, as law. For example, commercial usage and custom may develop and be recognized and respected by courts of law and other agencies as having normative force and legal significance.

Ehrlich claimed that the "living law" that regulates social life may be very different from the norms for decision applied by courts, and may sometimes attract far greater cultural authority which lawyers cannot safely ignore. Norms for decision regulate only those disputes that are brought before a judicial or other tribunal. Living law is a framework for the routine structuring of social relationships. Its source is in the many different kinds of social associations in which people co-exist. Its essence is not dispute and litigation, but peace and co-operation. What counts as law depends on what kind of authority exists to give it legal significance among those it is supposed to regulate.

Ehrlich's teaching is that the sources of law's authority are plural and insofar as some of those sources are political and others cultural they may conflict. But not all the norms of social associations should be thought of as 'law', in Ehrlich's view. Legal norms (understood sociologically, rather than juristically) are typically distinguished from merely moral or customary ones by powerful feelings of revulsion which typically attach to breach of them. They are, thus, regarded as socially fundamental. In addition, legal norms concern certain kinds of relationships, transactions and circumstances which he described as 'facts of the law'—specially important topics or considerations for social regulation.

'''Facadism''', '''façadism''' (or '''façadomy'''&lt;ref name="Byard1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Spencer Byard|title=The Architecture of Additions: Design and Regulation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LjnqyGeW_74C&amp;pg=PA105| date=1 January 1998| publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-393-73021-0|pages=105–}}&lt;/ref&gt;) refers to an architectural and construction practice where the [[facade]] of a building was designed or constructed separately from the rest of a building. More often it refers to the practice where only the facade of a building is preserved with new buildings erected behind or around it.

There are aesthetic and historical reasons for preserving building facades. Facadism can be the response to the interiors of a building becoming unusable, such as being damaged by fire. In developing areas, however, the practice is sometimes used by [[Real estate developer|property developers]] seeking to redevelop a site as a compromise to [[preservationist]]s who wish to preserve buildings of historical or aesthetic interest. It can be regarded as a compromise between [[historic preservation]] and [[demolition]] and thus has been lauded as well as decried.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

There is sometimes a blurred line between [[renovation]], [[adaptive reuse]], [[Reconstruction (architecture)|reconstruction]] and facadism. Sometimes buildings are renovated to such an extent that they are "skinned", preserving only the exterior shell, and used for purposes other than those for which they were originally intended. While this is equivalent to facadism, the difference is typically the retention of roof and or floor structures, maintaining a credible link to the original building. In contrast, facadism generally involves retaining only one or two street facing walls for purely [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] and decorative purposes.&lt;ref name="Richards2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan Richards| title=Facadism| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLf5erNaEEsC&amp;pg=PR7-IA17| date=12 November 2012| publisher=Routledge| isbn=978-1-134-88952-5| pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facadomy is a practice in [[postmodern architecture]] reaching its peak in the latter half of the 20th century. The setback or podium architecture technique gives an illusion of integrity to the original building by visually separating the old from the new, helping to mitigate farcical effects such as the floors and windows not lining up or a dramatic clash of styles.

Critics label the practice as architectural sham, claiming that it sometimes results in part of the building becoming a [[folly]].

==Distribution and control measures==
Despite being highly controversial and denounced by many preservationists as vandalism, facadism is used as the demand for new development is overwhelming community desires for preservation. Facadism appears often in cities where there is a strong pressure for new development.

While the controversial practice of facadism is encouraged by governments in some cities (such as [[Toronto]], [[Sydney]] and [[Brisbane]]), it is actively discouraged in others (such as [[Paris]] and [[Melbourne]]).

Architectural [[podium]]s are often seen by some architects as a solution to this problem and these are allowed for as part of planning frameworks in urban heritage areas.

===International policies===
The practice of facadism conflicts with [[ICOMOS]] international charters. The [[Venice Charter]], article 7, states that: "A monument is inseparable from the history to which it bears witness and from the setting in which it occurs. The moving of all or part of a monument cannot be allowed except where the safeguarding of that monument demands it or where it is justified by national or international interest of paramount importance".

===By country===

====Australia====
In Australia, the [[Burra Charter]] has some policies which deal with facadism.

=====Melbourne=====
In the rapidly growing city of Melbourne, facadism has existed as early as the 1930s.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The Old Commerce building at the [[University of Melbourne]] is a prominent example of a building which has been relocated and "stuck on" a newer building.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

}}

With the introduction of heritage controls in the later twentieth century, several large buildings have been completely "skinned".{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} These include the T&amp;G buildings on Collins Street and the Savoy Hotel on Spencer Street.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

However, implementation applied only to heritage registered buildings and it was relaxed in subsequent years,{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} which allowed several poor examples of facadism to appear particularly with heritage buildings of only local significance.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} For example, the heritage registered Carlton &amp; United Breweries site is a large site on [[Swanston Street, Melbourne]] which has contained hollow suspended facades for almost three decades.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} That led the [[Melbourne City Council]] to rethink the policy.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

In the late 1990s, facadism was discouraged with the introduction of a 10-metre policy, which advocated for the retention of at least 10 metres of the front of a building.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} This helped to retain context and the integrity of important transitions and relationships such as entrances and complex roof structures.

The Olderfleet group of buildings (which includes the Rialto and Winfield) and the 1 Collins Street development are seen as well-executed examples of this preservation policy.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

=====Brisbane=====
In Brisbane, facadism is encouraged by the [[Brisbane City Council]].{{citation needed| date=November 2014}} An example is the [[Myer Centre, Brisbane|Myer Centre]] which features extensive facadism of several buildings including the Hotel Carlton (1885), New York Hotel (1860) and Newspaper House. Other buildings which are facaded include the final design includes the facade of the Queensland Country Life Building (1888).

====Canada====
In Canada, all jurisdictions at the federal, provincial, territorial and municipal level have adopted the [[Standards &amp; Guidelines for the Conservation of Historic Places in Canada]], which does not recommend, though not explicit, facadism as good conservation practice. In general, projects which have approached projects using facadism are considered to have lost their integrity and value. Nonetheless, the preservation of the [[McLaughlin Motor Car Showroom]] during the construction of the [[Burano (building)|Burano skyscraper in Toronto]] is a recent example of facadism.

'''Feminism''' is a range of [[political movement]]s, [[ideologies]], and [[social movement]]s that share a common goal: to define, establish, and achieve political, economic, personal, and social [[Gender equality|equality of sexes]].&lt;ref name="Hawkesworth"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hawkesworth | first=Mary E.|title=Globalization and Feminist Activism |year=2006|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |pages=25–27 |isbn=9780742537835}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Beasley"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Beasley |first=Chris |title=What is Feminism? |year=1999|publisher=Sage |location=New York |pages=3–11 |isbn=9780761963356}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes seeking to establish educational and professional opportunities for women that are equal to those for men.

[[Feminist movement]]s have campaigned and continue to campaign for [[women's rights]], including the right to [[Women's suffrage|vote]], to hold public office, [[Right to work|to work]], to earn fair [[wages]] or [[Equal pay for equal work|equal pay]], to [[Right to property|own property]], [[Right to education|to receive education]], to enter contracts, to have equal rights within [[marriage]], and to have [[maternity leave]]. Feminists have also worked to ensure access to legal abortions and [[social integration]], and to protect women and girls from [[rape]], [[sexual harassment]], and [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref name="Echols"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Echols |first=Alice |authorlink=Alice Echols |title=Daring to Be Bad: Radical Feminism in America, 1967–1975 |year=1989 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-8166-1787-6 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in dress and acceptable physical activity have often been part of feminist movements.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Roberts |first1=Jacob |title=Women's work |magazine=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1 |pages=6–11 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/womens-work|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars consider feminist campaigns to be a main force behind major historical [[Social change|societal changes]] for [[women's rights]], particularly in [[Western world|the West]], where they are near-universally credited with achieving [[women's suffrage]], [[gender neutrality in English]], [[reproductive rights]] for women (including access to [[contraceptive]]s and [[support for the legalization of abortion|abortion]]), and the right to enter into contracts and [[property|own property]].&lt;ref name="Messer-Davidow"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Messer-Davidow |first=Ellen |title=Disciplining Feminism: From Social Activism to Academic Discourse |year=2002 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, [[North Carolina|NC]] |isbn=978-0-8223-2843-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although feminist advocacy is, and has been, mainly focused on women's rights, some feminists, including [[bell hooks]], argue for the inclusion of [[men's liberation]] within its aims because they believe that men are also harmed by traditional [[gender roles]].&lt;ref name="hooks"/&gt;
[[Feminist theory]], which emerged from feminist movements, aims to understand the nature of gender inequality by examining women's social roles and lived experience; it has developed theories in a variety of disciplines in order to respond to issues concerning gender.&lt;ref name="Chodorow1989"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Chodorow, Nancy |title=Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory |year=1989 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn. |isbn=978-0-300-05116-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gilligan1977"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gilligan |first=Carol |year=1977 |title=In a Different Voice: Women's Conceptions of Self and of Morality|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=47|issue=4 |pages=481–517|url=http://hepg.org/her-home/issues/harvard-educational-review-volume-47,-issue-4/herarticle/women-s-conceptions-of-self-and-of-morality_917 |accessdate=8 June 2008 |doi=10.17763/haer.47.4.g6167429416hg5l0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years and represent different viewpoints and aims. Some forms of feminism have been [[feminism#Civil rights movement and anti-racism|criticized]] for taking into account only white, middle class, and college-educated perspectives. This criticism led to the creation of ethnically specific or [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] forms of feminism, including [[black feminism]] and [[Intersectionality|intersectional feminism]].&lt;ref name=Weedon/&gt;

[[Charles Fourier]], a [[Utopian socialism|Utopian Socialist]] and French philosopher, is credited with having coined the word "féminisme" in 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Leslie F.|year=1982|title=Early Feminist Themes in French Utopian Socialism: The St.-Simonians and Fourier|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=43|issue=1|pages=91–108|doi=10.2307/2709162|jstor=2709162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The words "féminisme" ("feminism") and "féministe" ("feminist") first appeared in [[Feminism in France|France]] and the [[Feminism in the Netherlands|Netherlands]] in 1872,&lt;ref&gt;Dutch feminist pioneer [[Mina Kruseman]] in a letter to Alexandre Dumas – in: Maria Grever, Strijd tegen de stilte.

The [[First-wave feminism|first wave]] comprised women's suffrage movements of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, promoting women's right to vote. The [[Second-wave feminism|second wave]] was associated with the ideas and actions of the [[women's liberation movement]] beginning in the 1960s. The second wave campaigned for legal and social equality for women. The [[Third-wave feminism|third wave]] is a continuation of, and a reaction to, the perceived failures of second-wave feminism, which began in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Suffragettes to Grrls"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Krolokke |first1=Charlotte |first2=Anne Scott |last2=Sorensen |title=Gender Communication Theories and Analyses: From Silence to Performance |year=2005 |publisher=Sage |isbn=978-0-7619-2918-5 |page=24 |chapter=Three Waves of Feminism: From Suffragettes to Grrls}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First-wave feminism was a period of activity during the 19th century and early twentieth century. In the UK and eventually the US, it focused on the promotion of equal contract, marriage, parenting, and property rights for women. By the end of the 19th century, a number of important steps had been made with the passing of legislation such as the UK [[Custody of Infants Act 1839]] which introduced the [[Tender years doctrine]] for child custody arrangement and gave woman the right of custody of their children for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wroath|first=John|title=Until They Are Seven, The Origins of Women's Legal Rights|year=1998|publisher=Waterside Press|isbn=1 872 870 57 0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=L.

For example, [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] passed legislation in 1884, [[New South Wales]] in 1889, and the remaining Australian colonies passed similar legislation between 1890 and 1897. Therefore, with the turn of the 19th century activism had focused primarily on gaining political power, particularly the right of women's [[suffrage]], though some feminists were active in campaigning for women's [[Sexual and reproductive health and rights|sexual]], [[reproductive rights|reproductive]], and [[Economic, social and cultural rights|economic rights]] as well.&lt;ref name=NoTurningBack464&gt;{{cite book |author=Freedman, Estelle B. |title=No Turning Back : The History of Feminism and the Future of Women |year=2003 |publisher=Ballantine Books |isbn=978-0-345-45053-1 |page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Women's suffrage]] (the right to vote and stand for parliamentary office) began in Britain's [[Australasia]]n colonies at the close of the 19th century, with the self-governing colonies of [[Feminism in New Zealand|New Zealand]] granting women the [[right to vote]] in 1893 and South Australia granting female suffrage in 1895. This was followed by Australia granting female suffrage in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/votes-women |title=Votes for Women Electoral Commission|publisher=Elections New Zealand |date=13 April 2005 |accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/wright.htm|title=Women and the right to vote in Australia|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission |date=28 January 2011 |accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] the Suffragettes and the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies|Suffragists]] campaigned for the women's vote, and in 1918 the [[Representation of the People Act 1918|Representation of the People Act]] was passed granting the vote to women over the age of 30 who owned property. In 1928 this was extended to all women over 21.&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite book |author=Phillips, Melanie |title=The Ascent of Woman: A History of the Suffragette Movement and the Ideas Behind it |year=2004 |publisher=Abacus |location=London |isbn=978-0-349-11660-0 |pages=1–370}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] was the most notable activist in England, with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' naming her one of the [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|100 Most Important People of the 20th Century]] stating: "she shaped an idea of women for our time; she shook society into a new pattern from which there could be no going back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Emmeline Pankhurst&amp;nbsp;– Time 100 People of the Century |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,991250,00.html |publisher=[[Time Magazine]] |accessdate= |first=Marina |last=Warner |date=14 June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., notable leaders of this movement included [[Lucretia Mott]], [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], and [[Susan B. Anthony]], who each campaigned for the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] prior to championing women's right to vote.

During the late [[Qing Dynasty|Qing period]] and reform movements such as the [[Hundred Days' Reform]], [[Feminism in China|Chinese feminists]] called for women's liberation from traditional roles and [[Neo-Confucian]] [[Gender inequality in China|gender segregation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ko |first1=Dorothy |first2=JaHyun Kim |last2=Haboush |first3=Joan R. |last3=Piggott |title=Women and Confucian cultures in premodern China, Korea, and Japan |publisher=University of California Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-520-23138-2}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ma |first1=Yuxin |title=Women journalists and feminism in China, 1898–1937 |publisher=Cambria Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-1-60497-660-1}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Farris |first1=Catherine S. |first2=Anru |last2=Lee |first3=Murray A. |last3=Rubinstein |title=Women in the new Taiwan: gender roles and gender consciousness in a changing society |publisher=M.E.

According to Nawar al-Hassan Golley, Arab feminism was closely connected with [[Arab nationalism]]. In 1899, [[Qasim Amin]], considered the "father" of Arab feminism, wrote ''The Liberation of Women'', which argued for legal and social reforms for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stange |first1=Mary Zeiss |first2=Carol K. |last2=Oyster |first3=Jane E. |last3=Sloan |title=Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World |publisher=SAGE |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4129-7685-5 |pages=79–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; He drew links between women's position in Egyptian society and nationalism, leading to the development of Cairo University and the National Movement.&lt;ref name=Golley&gt;{{cite book |last=Golley |first=Nawar Al-Hassan |title=Reading Arab women's autobiographies: Shahrazad tells her story |publisher=University of Texas Press |year=2003 |pages=30–50 |isbn=978-0-292-70545-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 [[Hoda Shaarawi]] founded the [[Egyptian Feminist Union]], became its president and a symbol of the Arab women's rights movement.&lt;ref name=Golley/&gt;

In [[Women in France|France]], women obtained the [[Women's suffrage#France|right to vote]] only with the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic]] of 21 April 1944. The Consultative Assembly of Algiers of 1944 proposed on 24 March 1944 to grant eligibility to women but following an amendment by [[Fernand Grenier]], they were given full citizenship, including the right to vote. Grenier's proposition was adopted 51 to 16. In May 1947, following the [[French legislative election, November 1946|November 1946 elections]], the sociologist Robert Verdier minimized the "[[gender differences|gender gap]]", stating in ''[[Le Populaire]]'' that women had not voted in a consistent way, dividing themselves, as men, according to social classes. During the [[Post-World War II baby boom|baby boom]] period, feminism waned in importance. Wars (both World War I and World War II) had seen the provisional emancipation of some women, but post-war periods signalled the return to conservative roles.&lt;ref name=Bard&gt;{{cite journal |first=Christine |last=Bard |url=http://www.histoire-politique.fr/index.php?numero=01&amp;rub=dossier&amp;item=7 |title=Les premières femmes au Gouvernement (France, 1936–1981) |trans-title=First Women in Government (France, 1936–1981) |journal=[[Histoire@Politique]] |issue=1 |date=May–June 2007 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mid-twentieth century ===
By the mid 20th century, in some European countries, women still lacked some significant rights. Feminists in these countries continued to fight for voting rights. In [[Women in Switzerland|Switzerland]], women gained the [[Women's suffrage in Switzerland|right to vote]] in federal [[Elections in Switzerland|elections]] in 1971;&lt;ref name="switzerland-chronology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/chronology-womens-right-vote-switzerland.html |title=The Long Way to Women's Right to Vote in Switzerland: a Chronology |publisher=History-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch |accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in the canton of [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]] women obtained the right to vote on local issues only in 1991, when the canton was forced to do so by the [[Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2003/WOM1373.doc.htm |title=United Nations press release of a meeting of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), issued on 14 January 2003 |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2011-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Liechtenstein]], women were given the right to vote by the [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1984|women's suffrage referendum of 1984]]. Three prior referendums held in [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1968|1968]], [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1971|1971]] and [[Liechtenstein women's suffrage referendum, 1973|1973]] had failed to secure women's right to vote.

Feminists continued to campaign for the reform of [[family law]]s which gave husbands control over their wives. Although by the 20th century [[coverture]] had been abolished in the UK and the US, in many [[continental European]] countries married women still had very few rights. For instance, in France married women did not receive the right to work without their husband's permission until 1965.&lt;ref name=Guillaumin&gt;{{cite book |last=Guillaumin|first=Colette|year=1994 |title=Racism, Sexism, Power, and Ideology |pages=193–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meltzer&gt;{{cite book |last=Meltzer |first=Françoise |year=1995 |title=Hot Property: The Stakes and Claims of Literary Originality |page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists have also worked to abolish the [[marital rape|"marital exemption" in rape laws]] which precluded the prosecution of husbands for the rape of their wives.&lt;ref name=Allison&gt;{{cite book |last=Allison |first=Julie A. |year=1995 |title=Rape: The Misunderstood Crime |page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier efforts by first-wave feminists such as [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], [[Victoria Woodhull]] and [[Elizabeth Clarke Wolstenholme Elmy]] to criminalize marital rape in the late 19th century had failed;&lt;ref name=Bland&gt;{{cite book |last=Bland |first=Lucy |year=2002 |title=Banishing the Beast: Feminism, Sex and Morality |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Cl8nLdfgz1IC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage |accessdate=25 August 2013 |pages=135–49|isbn=9781860646812 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | issn = 1040-0656 | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = 54–68 [60] | last = Palczewski | first = Catherine Helen | title = Voltairine de Cleyre: Sexual Slavery and Sexual Pleasure in the Nineteenth Century | journal = NWSA Journal | date = 1995-10-01 | jstor = 4316402 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this was only achieved a century later in most Western countries, but is still not achieved in many other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crowell |first1=Nancy A. |last2=Burgess |first2=Ann W. |year=1997 |title=Understanding Violence Against Women |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French philosopher [[Simone de Beauvoir]] provided a [[Marxist]] solution and an [[existentialist]] view on many of the questions of feminism with the publication of ''Le Deuxième Sexe'' (''[[The Second Sex]]'') in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bergoffen |first=Debra |title=Simone de Beauvoir |date=16 August 2010 |origyear=17 August 2004 |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, Stanford University |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/beauvoir/ |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book expressed feminists' sense of injustice.

Second-wave feminism is largely concerned with issues of equality beyond suffrage, such as ending [[Sexism|gender discrimination]].&lt;ref name=NoTurningBack464/&gt;

Second-wave feminists see women's cultural and political inequalities as inextricably linked and encourage women to understand aspects of their personal lives as deeply politicized and as reflecting sexist power structures. The feminist activist and author [[Carol Hanisch]] coined the slogan "The Personal is Political", which became synonymous with the second wave.&lt;ref name=Echols/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hanisch&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholar.alexanderstreet.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2259 |title=Hanisch, New Intro to 'The Personal is Political' – Second Wave and Beyond |accessdate=8 June 2008 |last=Hanisch |first=Carol |date=1 January 2006 |website=The Personal Is Political |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515014413/http://scholar.alexanderstreet.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=2259 |archivedate=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second- and third-wave feminism in China has been characterized by a reexamination of women's roles during the communist revolution and other reform movements, and new discussions about whether women's equality has actually been fully achieved.&lt;ref name="Dooling" /&gt;

In 1956, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of [[Feminism in Egypt|Egypt]] initiated "[[state feminism]]", which outlawed [[Human rights in Egypt#Status of women|discrimination based on gender]] and granted women's suffrage, but also blocked political [[activism]] by feminist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Badran |first=Margot |title=Feminists, Islam, and nation: gender and the making of modern Egypt |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-691-02605-3}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat]]'s presidency, his wife, [[Jehan Sadat]], publicly advocated further women's rights, though Egyptian policy and society began to move away from women's equality with the new [[Islamist]] movement and growing conservatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Bonnie G. |title=Global feminisms since 1945 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-415-18491-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some activists proposed a new feminist movement, [[Islamic feminism]], which argues for women's equality within an Islamic framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milligazette.com/Archives/2004/16-31Jan04-Print-Edition/1631200425.htm |title=Islamic feminism means justice to women |website= The Mili Gazette |accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Feminism in Latin America|Latin America]], revolutions brought changes in women's status in countries such as [[Role of women in Nicaraguan Revolution|Nicaragua]], where [[feminist ideology during the Sandinista Revolution]] aided women's quality of life but fell short of achieving a social and ideological change.&lt;ref name="parpart"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Parpart |first=Jane L. |last2=Connelly |first2=M.

In 1963, [[Betty Friedan]]'s book ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' was published and helped voice the discontent that American women felt. The book is widely credited with sparking the beginning of [[second-wave feminism]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="nytimes2006"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/05/us/betty-friedan-who-ignited-cause-in-feminine-mystique-dies-at-85.html|title=Betty Friedan, Who Ignited Cause in 'Feminine Mystique,' Dies at 85|date=5 February 2006|author=Margalit Fox|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book's success also meant that Friedan could lecture her views while she was on tour in 1970.

==== Third-wave feminism ====
{{main|Third-wave feminism}}
[[File:Lozu mont oct8 bellhooooooooks.png|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Feminist, author and social activist [[bell hooks]] (b. 1952).]]
[[Third-wave feminism]] is traced to the emergence of the [[Riot grrrl]] feminist [[punk subculture]] in [[Olympia, Washington]], in the early 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Steve Feliciano (New York Public Library, 2013): "The emergence of the Riot Grrrl movement began in the early 1990s, when a group of women in Olympia, Washington, held a meeting to discuss how to address sexism in the punk scene. The women decided they wanted to start a 'girl riot' against a society they felt offered no validation of women's experiences. And thus the Riot Grrrl movement was born."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feliciano|first1=Steve|title=The Riot Grrrl Movement|url=http://www.nypl.org/blog/2013/06/19/riot-grrrl-movement|publisher=New York Public Library|date=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Anita Hill]]'s televised testimony in 1991—to an all-male, all-white [[Senate Judiciary Committee]]—that [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Clarence Thomas]], nominated for the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], had [[Sexual harassment|sexually harassed]] her.

Third-wave feminism also sought to challenge or avoid what it deemed the second wave's [[Essentialism|essentialist]] definitions of [[femininity]], which, third-wave feminists argued, over-emphasized the experiences of upper middle-class white women. Third-wave feminists often focused on "[[wikt:micropolitics|micro-politics]]" and challenged the second wave's paradigm as to what was, or was not, good for women, and tended to use a [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] interpretation of gender and sexuality.&lt;ref name=NoTurningBack464/&gt;&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;{{cite book |last=Henry |first=Astrid |title=Not my mother's sister: generational conflict and third-wave feminism |year=2004 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Bloomington |isbn=978-0-253-21713-4 |pages=1–288}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gillis&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gillis |first1=Stacy |last2=Howie |first2=Gillian |last3=Munford |first3=Rebecca |title=Third wave feminism: a critical exploration |year=2007 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=Basingstoke |isbn=978-0-230-52174-2 |pages=xxviii, 275–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Faludi&gt;{{cite book |last=Faludi |first=Susan |authorlink=Susan Faludi |title=Backlash: the undeclared war against women |year=1992 |publisher=Vintage |location=London |isbn=978-0-09-922271-2}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist leaders rooted in the second wave, such as [[Gloria Anzaldúa]], [[bell hooks]], [[Chela Sandoval]], [[Cherríe Moraga]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Maxine Hong Kingston]], and many other non-white feminists, sought to negotiate a space within feminist thought for consideration of race-related subjectivities.&lt;ref name=Gillis/&gt;&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;&lt;ref name=Heywood&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leslie |first1=Heywood |last2=Drake |first2=Jennifer |title=Third Wave Agenda: Being Feminist, Doing Feminism |year=1997 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-8166-3005-9}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Third-wave feminism also contained internal debates between [[difference feminism|difference feminists]], who believe that there are important psychological differences between the sexes, and those who believe that there are no inherent psychological differences between the sexes and contend that gender roles are due to [[social conditioning]].&lt;ref name=Gilligan&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilligan |first=Carol |authorlink=Carol Gilligan |title=In a different voice: psychological theory and women's development |year=1993 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-44544-4 |page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Standpoint theory ====
Standpoint theory is a feminist theoretical point of view that believes a persons' social position influences their knowledge.  This perspective argues that research and theory treats women and the feminist movement as insignificant and refuses to see traditional science as unbiased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = standpoint theory {{!}} feminism|url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/standpoint-theory|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1980s, [[Standpoint feminism|standpoint feminists]] have argued that the feminist movement should address [[global issue]]s (such as rape, [[incest]], and prostitution) and culturally specific issues (such as [[female genital mutilation]] in some parts of [[Women in Africa|Africa]] and [[Women in Arab societies|Arab societies]], as well as [[glass ceiling]] practices that impede women's advancement in developed economies) in order to understand how gender inequality interacts with racism, [[homophobia]], [[classism]] and [[colonization]] in a "[[matrix of domination]]".&lt;ref name="BFT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Harding2003&gt;{{cite book |last=Harding |first=Sandra |authorlink=Sandra Harding |title=The Feminist Standpoint Theory Reader: Intellectual and Political Controversies |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-94501-1 |pages=1–16, 67–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fourth-wave feminism ====
{{main|Fourth-wave feminism}}
[[Fourth-wave feminism]] refers to a resurgence of interest in feminism that began around 2012 and is associated with the use of [[social media]].&lt;ref name=4thWave-Guardian20131210/&gt; According to feminist scholar Prudence Chamberlain, the focus of the fourth wave is justice for women and opposition to [[sexual harassment]] and [[violence against women]]. Its essence, she writes, is "incredulity that certain attitudes can still exist".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Chamberlain|first=Prudence|title=The Feminist Fourth Wave: Affective Temporality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8AIkDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|year=2017|publisher=Springer|location=Cham|isbn=978-3-319-53682-8|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourth-wave feminism is "defined by technology", according to [[Kira Cochrane]], and is characterized particularly by the use of [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[YouTube]], [[Tumblr]], and blogs such as [[Feministing]] to challenge [[misogyny]] and further [[gender equality]].&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cochrane|first=Kira|authorlink=Kira Cochrane|title=The Fourth Wave of Feminism: Meet the Rebel Women|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/10/fourth-wave-feminism-rebel-women|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/15/magazine/15fob-q4-t.html|title=The Blogger and Author on the Life of Women Online|last=Solomon|first=Deborah|date=13 November 2009|work=The New York Times|access-date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/news/feminisms-fourth-wave-is-the-shitlist/|title=Feminism's Fourth Wave is the Shitlist|last=Zerbisias|first=Antonia|date=16 September 2015|website=NOW Toronto|publisher=|access-date=21 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="4thWave-Guardian20131210"/&gt;

Issues that fourth-wave feminists focus on include [[street harassment|street]] and [[workplace harassment]], [[campus sexual assault]] and [[rape culture]]. Scandals involving the harassment, abuse, and murder of women and girls have galvanized the movement. These have included the 2012 [[2012 Delhi gang rape|Delhi gang rape]], 2012 [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal|Jimmy Savile allegations]], the [[Bill Cosby sexual assault case|Bill Cosby allegations]], 2014 [[2014 Isla Vista killings|Isla Vista killings]], 2016 [[trial of Jian Ghomeshi]], 2017 [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations|Harvey Weinstein allegations]] and subsequent [[Weinstein effect]], and the 2017 [[2017 Westminster sexual scandals|Westminster sexual scandals]].&lt;ref&gt;For Cosby, Ghomeshi, #MeToo, and fourth wave, see Matheson, Kelsey (17 October 2017).

==== Post-feminism ====
The term [[post-feminism]] is used to describe a range of viewpoints reacting to feminism since the 1980s. While not being "anti-feminist", post-feminists believe that women have achieved second wave goals while being critical of third and fourth wave feminist goals. The term was first used to describe a backlash against second-wave feminism, but it is now a label for a wide range of theories that take critical approaches to previous feminist discourses and includes challenges to the second wave's ideas.&lt;ref name=Wright2000&gt;{{cite book |last=Wright |first=Elizabeth |title=Lacan and Postfeminism (Postmodern Encounters) |year=2000 |publisher=Totem Books |isbn=978-1-84046-182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other post-feminists say that feminism is no longer relevant to today's society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Modleski |first=Tania |title=Feminism without women: culture and criticism in a 'postfeminist' age |year=1991 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-90416-2 |page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amelia Jones]] has written that the post-feminist texts which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s portrayed second-wave feminism as a monolithic entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jones |first=Amelia |chapter=Postfeminism, Feminist Pleasures, and Embodied Theories of Art |title=New Feminist Criticism: Art, Identity, Action |editor1-first=Joana |editor1-last=Frueh |editor2-first=Cassandra L. |editor2-last=Langer |editor3-first=Arlene |editor3-last=Raven |location=New York |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1994 |pages=16–41, 20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy Chunn notes a "blaming narrative" under the post-feminist moniker, where feminists are undermined for continuing to make demands for [[gender equality]] in a "post-feminist" society, where "gender equality has (already) been achieved." According to Chunn, "many feminists have voiced disquiet about the ways in which rights and equality discourses are now used against them."&lt;ref&gt;Chunn, D. (2007).

{{see also|Gynocriticism|écriture féminine}}
Feminist theory is the extension of feminism into theoretical or philosophical fields. It encompasses work in a variety of disciplines, including [[feminist anthropology|anthropology]], [[feminist sociology|sociology]], [[feminist economics|economics]], [[women's studies]], [[feminist literary criticism|literary criticism]],&lt;ref name=Zajko&gt;{{cite book |author=Zajko, Vanda |author2=Leonard, Miriam |title=Laughing with Medusa: classical myth and feminist thought |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-927438-3 |page=445}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Howe&gt;{{cite book |last1=Howe |first1=Mica |last2=Aguiar |first2=Sarah Appleton |title=He said, she says: an RSVP to the male text |year=2001 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |location=Madison, NJ |isbn=978-0-8386-3915-3 |page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Art history#Psychoanalytic art history|art history]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Griselda |last=Pollock |title=Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive |publisher=Routledge |year=2007 |pages=1–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feminist theory#Psychoanalysis|psychoanalysis]]&lt;ref name=matrixial_borderspace&gt;{{cite book |author=Ettinger, Bracha |authorlink=Bracha Ettinger |author2=[[Judith Butler]] |author3=Brian Massumi |author4=Griselda Pollock  |title=The matrixial borderspace |year=2006 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-8166-3587-0 |page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[feminist philosophy|philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Brabeck, M. and Brown, L.

While providing a critique of these social and political relations, much of feminist theory also focuses on the promotion of women's rights and interests. Themes explored in feminist theory include discrimination, [[stereotyping]], [[objectification]] (especially [[sexual objectification]]), [[oppression]], and [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref name=Chodorow1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=gilligan1977/&gt;
In the field of [[literary criticism]], [[Elaine Showalter]] describes the development of feminist theory as having three phases. The first she calls "feminist critique", in which the feminist reader examines the ideologies behind literary phenomena. The second Showalter calls "[[gynocriticism]]", in which the "woman is producer of textual meaning". The last phase she calls "gender theory", in which the "ideological inscription and the literary effects of the sex/gender system are explored".&lt;ref name=showalter1979&gt;{{cite book |last1=Showalter |first1=Elaine |authorlink1=Elaine Showalter |editor1-first=M. |editor1-last=Jacobus |title=Women Writing about Women |year=1979 |publisher=Croom Helm |isbn=978-0-85664-745-1 |pages=25–36 |chapter=Towards a Feminist Poetics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was paralleled in the 1970s by [[French structuralist feminism|French feminists]], who developed the concept of ''[[écriture féminine]]'' (which translates as 'female or feminine writing').&lt;ref name=Wright2000/&gt; [[Helene Cixous]] argues that writing and philosophy are ''[[Wikt:phallocentric|phallocentric]]'' and along with other French feminists such as [[Luce Irigaray]] emphasize "writing from the body" as a subversive exercise.&lt;ref name=Wright2000/&gt; The work of [[Julia Kristeva]], a feminist psychoanalyst and philosopher, and [[Bracha Ettinger]],&lt;ref&gt;Ettinger, Bracha, 'The Matrixial Borderspace'.

However, as the scholar Elizabeth Wright points out, "none of these French feminists align themselves with the feminist movement as it appeared in the [[English-speaking world|Anglophone]] world".&lt;ref name=Wright2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Moi1986&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kristeva |first1=Julia |last2=Moi |first2=Toril |authorlink2=Toril Moi |title=The Kristeva reader |year=1986 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-06325-8 |page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent feminist theory, such as that of Lisa Lucile Owens,&lt;ref&gt;E.g., {{cite journal |title=Coerced Parenthood as Family Policy: Feminism, the Moral Agency of Women, and Men's 'Right to Choose' |first=Lisa Lucile |last=Owens |journal=Alabama Civil Rights &amp; Civil Liberties Law Review |volume=5 |page=1 |year=2003 |ssrn=2439294}}&lt;/ref&gt; has concentrated on characterizing feminism as a universal emancipatory movement.

== Movements and ideologies ==
{{Main|Feminist movements and ideologies}}
[[File:Woman-power emblem.svg|upright=0.45|thumb|right|A symbol of feminism based on the [[Venus symbol]] ]]
Many overlapping feminist movements and ideologies have developed over the years.

=== Political movements ===
Some branches of feminism closely track the political leanings of the larger society, such as liberalism and conservatism, or focus on the environment. [[Liberal feminism]] seeks individualistic equality of men and women through political and legal reform without altering the structure of society. Catherine Rottenberg has argued that the neoliberal shirt in Liberal feminism has led to that form of feminism being individualized rather than collectivized and becoming detached from social inequality.&lt;ref name="rotten"/&gt; Due to this she argues that Liberal Feminism cannot offer any sustained analysis of the structures of male dominance, power, or privilege.&lt;ref name="rotten"&gt;Catherine Rottenberg, "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09502386.2013.857361 The Rise of Neoliberal Feminism]", Cultural Studies. (2014) Vol. 28 (3), pgs. 424&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Radical feminism]] considers the male-controlled capitalist hierarchy as the defining feature of women's oppression and the total uprooting and reconstruction of society as necessary.&lt;ref name="Echols" /&gt; [[List of conservative feminisms|Conservative feminism]] is conservative relative to the society in which it resides. [[Individualist feminism|Libertarian feminism]] conceives of people as self-owners and therefore as entitled to freedom from coercive interference.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-liberal/#ClasCri |title=Liberal Feminism |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University |year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Separatist feminism]] does not support heterosexual relationships. Lesbian feminism is thus closely related. Other feminists criticize separatist feminism as sexist.&lt;ref name="hooks"&gt;{{cite book |last=hooks |first=bell |authorlink=Bell hooks |year=2000 |title=Feminism Is for Everybody: Passionate Politics |publisher=[[South End Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-89608-629-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eco-feminist|Ecofeminists]] see men's control of land as responsible for the oppression of women and destruction of the [[ecology|natural environment]]; ecofeminism has been criticized for focusing too much on a mystical connection between women and nature.&lt;ref name="Biehl"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Biehl |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Biehl |title=Rethinking eco-feminist politics |year=1991 |publisher=[[South End Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-89608-392-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Materialist ideologies ===
[[Rosemary Hennessy]] and Chrys Ingraham say that materialist forms of feminism grew out of Western Marxist thought and have inspired a number of different (but overlapping) movements, all of which are involved in a critique of capitalism and are focused on ideology's relationship to women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Hennessy |first= Rosemary |first2=Chrys |last2=Ingraham |title=Materialist feminism: a reader in class, difference, and women's lives |location= London |publisher=Routledge | pages=1–13 |isbn=978-0-415-91634-9 |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxist feminism]] argues that capitalism is the root cause of women's oppression, and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies.&lt;ref name="Bottomore"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Bottomore, T.B. |title=A Dictionary of Marxist thought |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | page=215 |isbn=978-0-631-18082-1 |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socialist feminism]] distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that women's liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women's oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/modern/Socialist-Feminism.html |title=What is Socialist Feminism? |author=Barbara Ehrenreich |publisher=feministezine.com |accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anarcha-feminism|Anarcha-feminists]] believe that [[class struggle]] and [[anarchism|anarchy]] against the [[State (polity)|state]]&lt;ref name="farrow"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Dunbar-Ortiz |first=Roxanne |title=Quiet Rumours |publisher=AK Press |isbn=978-1-902593-40-1 |year=2002 |pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; require struggling against patriarchy, which comes from involuntary hierarchy.

=== Black and postcolonial ideologies ===
[[Sara Ahmed]] argues that [[Black feminism|Black]] and [[Postcolonial feminism|Postcolonial]] feminisms pose a challenge "to some of the organizing premises of Western feminist thought."&lt;ref name="Ahmed"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ahmed, Sarta |title= Transformations: thinking through feminism |year=2000 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-22066-8 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; During much of its [[history of feminism|history]], feminist movements and [[Feminism#Theoretical schools|theoretical developments]] were led predominantly by middle-class white women from Western Europe and North America.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Walker, Alice |title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose |year=1983 |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=San Diego |isbn=978-0-15-144525-7 |page=397|title-link=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens: Womanist Prose }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BFT"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hill Collins |first=P. |title=Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment |location=New York |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |pages=1–335}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Narayan"/&gt; However women of other races have proposed alternative feminisms.&lt;ref name="BFT" /&gt; This trend accelerated in the 1960s with the civil rights movement in the United States and the collapse of European colonialism in Africa, the Caribbean, parts of Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Since that time, women in [[Third World|developing nations]] and [[postcolonialism|former colonies]] and who are of colour or various ethnicities or living in poverty have proposed additional feminisms.&lt;ref name="Narayan" /&gt; [[Womanism]]&lt;ref name="Ogunyemi"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/494200 |title=Womanism: The Dynamics of the Contemporary Black Female Novel in English |year=1985 |last1=Ogunyemi |first1=Chikwenye Okonjo |journal=Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=63–80 |jstor=3174287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kolawole"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Kolawole, Mary Ebun Modupe |title=Womanism and African Consciousness |year=1997 |publisher=Africa World Press |location=Trenton, N.J. |isbn=978-0-86543-540-7 |page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; emerged after early feminist movements were largely white and middle-class.&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt; Postcolonial feminists argue that colonial oppression and Western feminism marginalized postcolonial women but did not turn them passive or voiceless.&lt;ref name=Weedon&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weedon |first=Chris |title=Key Issues in Postcolonial Feminism: A Western Perspective |year=2002 |url=http://www.genderforum.org/issues/genderealisations/key-issues-in-postcolonial-feminism-a-western-perspective/ |journal=Gender Forum |issue=1 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203002056/http://www.genderforum.org/issues/genderealisations/key-issues-in-postcolonial-feminism-a-western-perspective/ |archivedate=3 December 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Third-world feminism]] and [[Indigenous feminism]] are closely related to postcolonial feminism.&lt;ref name="Narayan"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Narayan |first=Uma |title=Dislocating Cultures: Identities, Traditions, and Third-World Feminism |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-91418-5 |pages=20–28, 113, 161–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas also correspond with ideas in African feminism, motherism,&lt;ref name="Acholonu"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Obianuju Acholonu |first=Catherine |title=Motherism: The Afrocentric Alternative to Feminism |year=1995 |publisher=Afa Publ. |isbn=978-978-31997-1-2 |page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stiwanism,&lt;ref name="Ogundipe-Leslie"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Ogundipe-Leslie |first=Molara |title=Re-creating Ourselves: African Women &amp; Critical Transformations |year=1994 |publisher=Africa World Press |isbn=978-0-86543-412-7 |page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; negofeminism,&lt;ref name="Nnaemeka"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nnaemeka |first=Obioma |title=Feminism, Rebellious Women, and Cultural Boundaries: Rereading Flora Nwapa and Her Compatriots |journal=Research in African Literatures |year=1995 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=80–113 |jstor=3820273}}&lt;/ref&gt; femalism, [[transnational feminism]], and [[Africana womanism]].&lt;ref name="Hudson-Weems"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hudson-Weems |first=Clenora |title=Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves |year=1994 |publisher=Bedford Publishers |location=Troy, Mich. |isbn=978-0-911557-11-4 |page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
According to 2015 poll, 18 percent of Americans consider themselves feminists, while 85 percent reported they believe in "equality for women". Despite the popular belief in equal rights, 52 percent did not identify as feminist, 26 percent were unsure, and four percent provided no response.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Allum |first=Cynthia  |date=9 April 2015 |title=82 percent of Americans don't consider themselves feminists, poll shows |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=http://nytlive.nytimes.com/womenintheworld/2015/04/09/82-percent-of-americans-dont-consider-themselves-feminists-poll-shows/ |accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 2014 [[Ipsos]] poll covering 15 developed countries, 53 percent of respondents identified as feminists, and 87% agreed that "women should be treated equally to men in all areas based on their competency, not their gender". However, only 55% of women agreed that they have "full equality with men and the freedom to reach their full dreams and aspirations".&lt;ref name=ipsos&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipsos-na.com/news-polls/pressrelease.aspx?id=6511 |last=Clark |first=Julia |title= Can Men Be Feminists Too?

Among women, some of the strongest support for feminism was found in Sweden, where one in three (36%) agreed very much that they defined themselves as feminists. They were followed by women in Italy (31%) and Argentina (29%). Those in the middle of the ranking were from Great Britain (22%), Spain (22%), United States (20%), Australia (18%), Belgium (18%), France (18%), Canada (17%), Poland (17%), and Hungary (15%). Women least likely to agree very much were from Japan (8%), Germany (7%) and South Korea (7%).&lt;ref name=ipsos/&gt;

One quarter of men in Italy (25%) and Argentina (25%), and two in ten of those in Poland (21%) and France (19%), defined themselves as feminists. They were followed by those from Sweden (17%), Spain (16%), the United States (16%), Canada (15%), Great Britain (14%), Hungary (12%), Belgium (11%) and Australia (10%). Men least likely to identify this way were from South Korea (7%), Germany (3%) and Japan (3%).&lt;ref name=ipsos/&gt;

Women were more likely to self-identify as being feminists than men in every country in the study except for Poland, where 21% of men were and only 17% of women were likely to agree very much with the statement, and South Korea, where there was no difference between men and women (7%) on this measure.&lt;ref name=ipsos/&gt;

== Sexuality ==
{{Main|Feminist views on sexuality}}
[[Feminist views on sexuality]] vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality have taken a few different directions. Matters such as the [[sex industry]], sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in what came to be known as the [[feminist sex wars]], which pitted [[Anti-pornography movement|anti-pornography feminism]] against [[sex-positive feminism]], and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates.&lt;ref name=Duggan /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hansen |first1=Karen Tranberg |last2=Philipson |first2=Ilene J. |title=Women, class, and the feminist imagination: a socialist-feminist reader |year=1990 |publisher=Temple University Press |location=Philadelphia |isbn=978-0-87722-630-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerhard&gt;{{cite book |author=Gerhard, Jane F. |title=Desiring revolution: second-wave feminism and the rewriting of American sexual thought, 1920 to 1982 |year=2001 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-11204-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leidholdt&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leidholdt |first1=Dorchen |authorlink=Dorchen Leidholdt |last2=Raymond |first2=Janice G. |title=The Sexual liberals and the attack on feminism |year=1990 |publisher=Pergamon Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-08-037457-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vance&gt;{{cite book |author=Vance, Carole S. |title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality |publisher=Thorsons Publishers|isbn=978-0-04-440593-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the [[sexual revolution]] from the 1960s and 70s.

=== Sex industry ===
{{main|Sex industry|Feminist views on pornography|Feminist views on prostitution|Feminist sex wars| Male prostitution#Feminist studies}}
Opinions on the sex industry are diverse. Feminists critical of the sex industry generally see it as the exploitative result of patriarchal social structures which reinforce sexual and cultural attitudes complicit in rape and sexual harassment. Alternately, feminists who support at least part of the sex industry argue that it can be a medium of feminist expression and a means for women to take control of their sexuality. For the views of feminism on male prostitutes see the article on [[Male prostitution#Feminist studies|male prostitution]].

Feminist views of pornography range from condemnation of pornography as a form of [[violence against women]], to an embracing of some forms of pornography as a medium of feminist expression.&lt;ref name=Duggan&gt;{{cite book |author1=Duggan, Lisa |author2=Hunter, Nan D. |title=Sex wars: sexual dissent and political culture |year=1995 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-91036-1 |pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hansen/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gerhard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Leidholdt/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vance/&gt; Similarly, feminists' views on prostitution vary, ranging from critical to supportive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=O'Neill |first=Maggie |year=2001 |title=Prostitution and Feminism |publisher=Polity Press |location=Cambridge |pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Affirming female sexual autonomy ===
For feminists, a woman's right to control her own [[Right to sexuality|sexuality]] is a key issue. Feminists such as [[Catharine MacKinnon]] argue that women have very little control over their own bodies, with female sexuality being largely controlled and defined by men in patriarchal societies. Feminists argue that sexual violence committed by men is often rooted in ideologies of male sexual entitlement, and that these systems grant women very few legitimate options to refuse sexual advances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rohana Ariffin|author2=Women's Crisis Centre (Pinang, Malaysia)|title=Shame, secrecy, and silence: study on rape in Penang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HfsDAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=1 October 2011|year=1997|publisher=Women's Crisis Centre|isbn=978-983-99348-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bennett L, Manderson L, Astbury J.

University of Melbourne, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; In many{{clarify|date=June 2018}} cultures, men do not believe that a woman has the right to reject a man's sexual advances or to make an autonomous decision about participating in sex. Feminists argue that all cultures are, in one way or another, dominated by ideologies that largely deny women the right to decide how to express their sexuality, because men under patriarchy feel entitled to define sex on their own terms. This entitlement can take different forms, depending on the culture. In many{{clarify|date=June 2018}} parts of the world, especially in [[conservative]] and religious cultures, marriage is regarded as an institution which requires a wife to be sexually available at all times, virtually without limit; thus, forcing or coercing sex on a wife is not considered a crime or even an abusive behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Jewkes R, Abrahams N |title= The epidemiology of rape and sexual coercion in South Africa: an overview|pmid=12365533|year=2002|volume=55|issue=7|pages=1231–44|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|doi=10.1016/s0277-9536(01)00242-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sen P. Ending the presumption of consent: nonconsensual sex in marriage. London, Centre for Health and Gender Equity, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In more liberal cultures, this entitlement takes the form of a general [[sexualization]] of the whole culture. This is played out in the [[sexual objectification]] of women, with pornography and other forms of sexual entertainment creating the fantasy that all women exist solely for men's sexual pleasure, and that women are readily available and desiring to engage in sex at any time, with any man, on a man's terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/apr/12/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Stuart |last=Jeffries |title=Stuart Jeffries talks to leading feminist Catharine MacKinnon |date=2006-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lynn Hankinson Nelson notes that feminist empiricists find fundamental differences between the experiences of men and women. Thus, they seek to obtain knowledge through the examination of the experiences of women, and to "uncover the consequences of omitting, misdescribing, or devaluing them" to account for a range of human experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hankinson Nelson, Lynn |year=1990|title=Who Knows: from Quine To a Feminist Empiricism|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-0-87722-647-5|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another part of the feminist research agenda is the uncovering of ways in which power inequities are created or reinforced in society and in scientific and academic institutions.&lt;ref name="QCommRsrch"/&gt; Furthermore, despite calls for greater attention to be paid to structures of gender inequity in the academic literature, structural analyses of gender bias rarely appear in highly cited psychological journals, especially in the commonly studied areas of psychology and personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cortina |first1=L.

Feminism in psychology emerged as a critique of the dominant male outlook on psychological research where only male perspectives were studied with all male subjects.

Gender-based inquiries into and conceptualization of architecture have also come about, leading to [[Feminism and modern architecture|feminism in modern architecture]]. Piyush Mathur coined the term "archigenderic". Claiming that "architectural planning has an inextricable link with the defining and regulation of gender roles, responsibilities, rights, and limitations", Mathur came up with that term "to explore&amp;nbsp;... the meaning of 'architecture' in terms of gender" and "to explore the meaning of 'gender' in terms of architecture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09699089800200034 |title=The archigenderic territories: Mansfield park and a handful of dust |year=1998 |last1=Mathur |first1=Piyush |journal=Women's Writing |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=71–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Businesses ===
Feminist activists have established a range of [[feminist businesses]], including women's bookstores, feminist credit unions, feminist presses, feminist mail-order catalogs, and feminist restaurants.

The feminist movement produced feminist fiction, feminist non-fiction, and feminist poetry, which created new interest in [[Women's writing (literary category)|women's writing]]. It also prompted a general reevaluation of women's [[Women's history|historical]] and academic contributions in response to the belief that women's lives and contributions have been underrepresented as areas of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name=Blain&gt;{{cite book |author=Blain, Virginia |author2=Clements, Patricia |author3=Grundy, Isobel  |title=The feminist companion to literature in English: women writers from the Middle Ages to the present |year=1990 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-04854-4 |pages=vii–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been a close link between feminist literature and [[activism]], with feminist writing typically voicing key concerns or ideas of feminism in a particular era.

Much of the early period of feminist literary scholarship was given over to the rediscovery and reclamation of texts written by women. In Western feminist literary scholarship, Studies like [[Dale Spender]]'s ''Mothers of the Novel'' (1986) and Jane Spencer's ''The Rise of the Woman Novelist'' (1986) were ground-breaking in their insistence that women have always been writing.

Commensurate with this growth in scholarly interest, various presses began the task of reissuing long-out-of-print texts. [[Virago Press]] began to publish its large list of 19th and early-20th-century novels in 1975 and became one of the first commercial presses to join in the project of reclamation. In the 1980s Pandora Press, responsible for publishing Spender's study, issued a companion line of 18th-century novels written by women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sandra M. |last=Gilbert |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE4DD1E3AF937A35756C0A960948260 |title=Paperbacks: From Our Mothers' Libraries: women who created the novel |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=4 May 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Broadview Press]] continues to issue 18th- and 19th-century novels, many hitherto out of print, and the [[University of Kentucky]] has a series of republications of early women's novels.

Particular works of literature have come to be known as key feminist texts. ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792) by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], is one of the earliest works of feminist philosophy. ''[[A Room of One's Own]]'' (1929) by [[Virginia Woolf]], is noted in its argument for both a literal and figural space for women writers within a literary tradition dominated by patriarchy.

The widespread interest in women's writing is related to a general reassessment and expansion of the [[literary canon]]. Interest in [[post-colonial literature]]s, [[LGBT literature|gay and lesbian literature]], writing by people of colour, working people's writing, and the cultural productions of other historically marginalized groups has resulted in a whole scale expansion of what is considered "literature", and genres hitherto not regarded as "literary", such as children's writing, journals, letters, travel writing, and many others are now the subjects of scholarly interest.&lt;ref name="Blain" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Buck |editor1-first=Claire |title=The Bloomsbury Guide to Women's Literature |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1992 |page=vix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Salzman |first=Paul |chapter=Introduction |title=Early Modern Women's Writing |publisher=Oxford UP |year=2000 |pages=ix–x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most [[Literary genre|genres and subgenres]] have undergone a similar analysis, so literary studies has entered new territories such as the "[[Gothic fiction#The female Gothic and the supernatural explained|female gothic]]"&lt;ref&gt;Term coined by Ellen Moers in ''Literary Women: The Great Writers'' (New York: Doubleday, 1976).

According to Elyce Rae Helford, "Science fiction and fantasy serve as important vehicles for feminist thought, particularly as bridges between theory and practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Helford, Elyce Rae |editor-first=Gary |editor-last=Westfahl |title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy |chapter=Feminist Science Fiction |year=2005 |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=978-0-300-04854-4 |pages=289–291}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist science fiction is sometimes taught at the university level to explore the role of social constructs in understanding gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1207/s15328023top1703_17 |title=Using Science Fiction to Teach the Psychology of Sex and Gender |year=1990 |last1=Lips |first1=Hilary M. |journal=Teaching of Psychology |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=197–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable texts of this kind are [[Ursula K.

Feminist nonfiction has played an important role in voicing concerns about women's lived experiences. For example, [[Maya Angelou]]'s ''[[I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings|I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings]]'' was extremely influential, as it represented the specific racism and sexism experienced by black women growing up in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://feminisminindia.com/2018/08/10/i-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings-review-maya-angelou/|title=I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings: Angelou's Quest to Truth and Power|last=Shah|first=Mahvish|date=2018|website=Feminism in India|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many feminist movements have embraced [[poetry]] as a vehicle through which to communicate feminist ideas to public audiences through anthologies, poetry collections, and public readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/articles/144696/a-change-of-world|title=A Change of World|last=Poetry Foundation|date=2018-11-29|website=Poetry Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminism became a principal concern of [[Musicology|musicologists]] in the 1980s&lt;ref name=mus&gt;Beard, David; Gload, Kenneth. 2005. Musicology : The Key Concepts. London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the [[New Musicology]]. Prior to this, in the 1970s, musicologists were beginning to discover women composers and performers, and had begun to review concepts of [[Western canon|canon]], genius, genre and periodization from a feminist perspective. In other words, the question of how women musicians fit into traditional music history was now being asked.&lt;ref name=mus/&gt; Through the 1980s and 1990s, this trend continued as musicologists like [[Susan McClary]], [[Marcia Citron]] and Ruth Solie began to consider the cultural reasons for the marginalizing of women from the received body of work. Concepts such as music as gendered discourse; professionalism; reception of women's music; examination of the sites of music production; relative wealth and [[Female education|education of women]]; popular music studies in relation to women's identity; patriarchal ideas in music analysis; and notions of gender and difference are among the themes examined during this time.&lt;ref name=mus/&gt;

While the [[music industry]] has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the [[Conducting|leader of an orchestra]].&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/28/why-male-domination-of-classical-music-might-end |title=Why the male domination of classical music might be coming to an end|first=Jessica |last=Duchen |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the [[Audio mixer|audio console]] acting as [[Record producer|music producers]], the individuals who direct and manage the recording process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Rosina |last=Ncube |title=Sounding Off: Why So Few Women in Audio? |website=Sound on Sound |date=September 2013 |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/people/sounding-why-so-few-women-audio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema===
{{main|Feminist film theory}}
{{see also|Women's cinema}}

Feminist cinema, advocating or illustrating feminist perspectives, arose largely with the development of [[feminist film theory]] in the late '60s and early '70s. Women who were radicalized during the 1960s by political debate and sexual liberation; but the failure of radicalism to produce substantive change for women galvanized them to form consciousness-raising groups and set about analysing, from different perspectives, dominant cinema's construction of women.&lt;ref&gt;Hayward S., ''Cinema Studies – The Key Concepts'', 3rd edn, Routledge, 2006;134–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Differences were particularly marked between [[Feminist film theory#History|feminists on either side of the Atlantic]]. 1972 saw the first feminist film festivals in the U.S. and U.K. as well as the first feminist film journal, [[List of film periodicals|''Women and Film'']]. Trailblazers from this period included [[Claire Johnston]] and [[Laura Mulvey]], who also organized the Women's Event at the [[Edinburgh International Film Festival|Edinburgh Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;Erens, P., ''Issues in Feminist Film Criticism'', Wiley &amp; Sons, 1991; 270.&lt;/ref&gt; Other theorists making a powerful impact on feminist film include [[Teresa de Lauretis]], Anneke Smelik and [[Kaja Silverman]]. Approaches in philosophy and psychoanalysis fuelled feminist film criticism, feminist independent film and feminist distribution.

It has been argued that there are two distinct approaches to independent, theoretically inspired feminist filmmaking. 'Deconstruction' concerns itself with analysing and breaking down codes of mainstream cinema, aiming to create a different relationship between the spectator and dominant cinema. The second approach, a feminist counterculture, embodies feminine writing to investigate a specifically feminine cinematic language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Kuhn |editor1-first=A. |editor2-last=Radstone |editor2-first=S. |title=Women's Companion to International Film |publisher=Virago |year=1990 |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some recent criticism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/11/what-really-makes-a-film-feminist/281402/ |title=What really makes a feminist film? |work=[[The Atlantic]] |first=Holly L. |last=Derr |date=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of "feminist film" approaches has centred around a Swedish rating system called the [[Bechdel test]].

Prentice-Hall 1996;416.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then female directors such as [[Sally Potter]], [[Catherine Breillat]], [[Claire Denis]] and [[Jane Campion]] have made art movies, and directors like [[Kathryn Bigelow]] and [[Patty Jenkins]] have had mainstream success.

Feminism had complex interactions with the major political movements of the twentieth century.

=== Socialism ===
{{main|Left-wing politics#Social progressivism and counterculture|l1=Social Progressivism and Counterculture}}
Since the late nineteenth century some feminists have allied with socialism, whereas others have criticized socialist ideology for being insufficiently concerned about women's rights. [[August Bebel]], an early activist of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democratic Party]] (SPD), published his work ''Die Frau und der Sozialismus'', juxtaposing the struggle for equal rights between sexes with social equality in general. In 1907 there was an [[International Socialist Women's Conferences#Stuttgart 1907|International Conference of Socialist Women]] in [[Stuttgart]] where suffrage was described as a tool of class struggle. [[Clara Zetkin]] of the SPD called for women's suffrage to build a "''socialist order, the only one that allows for a radical solution to the women's question''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Badia, Gilbert |title=Zetkin. Femminista senza frontiere |year=1994 |publisher=University of Michigan. |isbn=978-88-85378-53-7 |page=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hww5"/&gt;

In Britain, the women's movement was allied with the [[Labour party (UK)|Labour party]]. In the U.S., [[Betty Friedan]] emerged from a radical background to take leadership. [[Radical Women]] is the oldest socialist feminist organization in the U.S. and is still active.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Radical Women Manifesto: Socialist Feminist Theory, Program and Organizational Structure |year=2001 |publisher=Red Letter Press |location=Seattle, WA |isbn=978-0-932323-11-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Spanish Civil War]], [[Dolores Ibárruri]] (''La Pasionaria'') led the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]]. Although she supported equal rights for women, she opposed women fighting on the front and clashed with the [[Anarcha-Feminism|anarcha-feminist]] [[Mujeres Libres]].&lt;ref name="Ib"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ibárruri, Dolores |title=Speeches &amp; Articles, 1936–1938 |year=1938 |publisher=University of Michigan |page=263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminists in Ireland in the early 20th century included the [[revolutionary]] [[Irish Republicanism|Irish Republican]], [[suffragette]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] [[Constance Markievicz]] who in 1918 was the first woman elected to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]]. However, in line with Sinn Féin [[abstentionism|abstentionist]] policy, she would not take her seat in the House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishresistancebooks.com/internment/intern6.htm|title=Internment – Women Internees 1916–1973|author=John McGuffin|year=1973

=== Fascism ===
{{further|Fascism and ideology|Women in Nazi Germany}}
[[File:Feministas en lucha anti Pinochet (de Kena Lorenzini).jpg|thumb|Chilean feminists protest against the regime of [[Augusto Pinochet]]]]
Fascism has been prescribed dubious stances on feminism by its practitioners and by women's groups. Amongst other demands concerning social reform presented in the [[Fascist manifesto]] in 1919 was expanding the suffrage to all Italian citizens of age 18 and above, including women (accomplished only in 1946, after the defeat of fascism) and eligibility for all to stand for office from age 25. This demand was particularly championed by special Fascist women's auxiliary groups such as the ''fasci femminilli'' and only partly realized in 1925, under pressure from dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]'s more conservative coalition partners.&lt;ref name="hagg"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hägg |first=Göran |year=2008 |title=Mussolini: En studie i makt |trans-title=A study in power |language=sv |publisher=Norstedt |location=Stockholm |isbn=978-91-1-301949-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="passmore"&gt;{{cite book |last=Passmore |first=Kevin |authorlink=Definitions_of_fascism#Kevin_Passmore |year=2003 |title=Women, Gender and Fascism in Europe, 1919–45 |publisher=Rutgers Univ.

Cyprian Blamires states that although feminists were among those who opposed the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]], feminism has a complicated relationship with the [[Nazi]] movement as well. While Nazis glorified traditional notions of patriarchal society and its role for women, they claimed to recognize women's equality in employment.&lt;ref name=Blamires&gt;{{cite book |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia |last=Blamires |first=Cyprian |volume=1 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-57607-940-9 |pages=232–33|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Hitler and Mussolini declared themselves as opposed to feminism,&lt;ref name=Blamires/&gt; and after the rise of [[Nazism]] in Germany in 1933, there was a rapid dissolution of the political rights and economic opportunities that feminists had fought for during the pre-war period and to some extent during the 1920s.&lt;ref name=hww5/&gt; Georges Duby et al. note that in practice fascist society was hierarchical and emphasized male virility, with women maintaining a largely subordinate position.&lt;ref name=hww5&gt;{{cite book |last1=Duby |first1=Georges |last2=Perrot |first2=Michelle |last3=Schmitt Pantel |first3=Pauline |title=A history of women in the West |year=1994 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-674-40369-7 |page=600}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blamires also notes that Neofascism has since the 1960s been hostile towards feminism and advocates that women accept "their traditional roles".&lt;ref name=Blamires/&gt;

=== Civil rights movement and anti-racism ===
The [[civil rights movement]] has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. Many Western feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights and the rights of non-white people.&lt;ref name="Levy"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Peter |year=1998 |title=The Civil Rights Movement |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. |isbn=978-0-313-29854-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the connections between the women's and civil rights movements, some tension arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned with race issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Code |first=Lorraine |title=Encyclopedia of Feminist Theories |chapter=Civil rights |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-415-13274-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns.&lt;ref name="Levy" /&gt; These criticisms created new feminist social theories about the intersections of racism, [[classism]], and [[sexism]], and new feminisms, such as [[black feminism]] and [[Chicana feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roth |first=Benita |title=Separate Roads to Feminism: Black, Chicana, and White feminist movements in America's second wave |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-521-52972-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Winddance Twine |first1=France |first2=Kathleen M. |last2=Blee |title=Feminism and Antiracism: International struggles for justice |publisher=NYU Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-8147-9855-3}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoliberalism===
[[Neoliberalism]] has been criticized by feminist theory for having a negative effect on the female workforce population across the globe, especially in the global south.  Masculinist assumptions and objectives continue to dominate economic and geopolitical thinking.&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Peterson |first=V. Spike |year=2014 |chapter=International/Global Political Economy |editor-last=Shepherd | editor-first=Laura J. |title=Gender Matters in Global Politics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2AKBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT291 |edition=2 |publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134752591 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|177}} Women's experiences in non-industrialized countries reveal often deleterious effects of modernization policies and undercut orthodox claims that development benefits everyone.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|175}}

Proponents of neoliberalism have theorized that by increasing women's participation in the workforce, there will be heightened economic progress, but feminist critics have noted that this participation alone does not further equality in gender relations.&lt;ref name="elias"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elias |first1=Juanita |last2=Ferguson |first2=Lucy |year=2014 |chapter=Production, Employment, and Consumption |editor-last=Shepherd | editor-first=Laura J. |title=Gender Matters in Global Politics |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2AKBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT291 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781134752591 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|186–98}} Neoliberalism has failed to address significant problems such as the devaluation of feminized labour, the structural privileging of men and masculinity, and the politicization of women's subordination in the family and the workplace.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|176}} The "feminization of employment" refers to a conceptual characterization of deteriorated and devalorized labour conditions that are less desirable, meaningful, safe and secure.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|179}}  Employers in the global south have perceptions about feminine labour and seek workers who are perceived to be undemanding, docile and willing to accept low wages.&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;{{rp|180}}  Social constructs about feminized labour have played a big part in this, for instance, employers often perpetuate ideas about women as 'secondary income earners to justify their lower rates of pay and not deserving of training or promotion.&lt;ref name="elias"/&gt;{{rp|189}}

== Societal impact ==
{{Main|Feminist effects on society}}
The feminist movement has effected change in Western society, including women's suffrage; greater access to education; more nearly equitable pay with men; the right to initiate divorce proceedings; the right of women to make individual decisions regarding pregnancy (including access to contraceptives and abortion); and the right to own property.&lt;ref name="Messer-Davidow"/&gt;

From the 1960s on, the campaign for women's rights&lt;ref name="quarterly"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Lockwood, Bert B. |title=Women's Rights: A Human Rights Quarterly Reader |year=2006 |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-8374-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; was met with mixed results&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jofreeman.com/feminism/suffrage.htm |title=FROM SUFFRAGE TO WOMEN'S LIBERATION: FEMINISM IN TWENTIETH CENTURY AMERICA by Jo Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the U.S. and the U.K. Other countries of the [[European Economic Community|EEC]] agreed to ensure that discriminatory laws would be phased out across the European Community.

Some feminist campaigning also helped reform attitudes to [[child sexual abuse]]. The view that young girls cause men to have sexual intercourse with them was replaced by that of men's responsibility for their own conduct, the men being adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rush |first=Florence |authorlink=Florence Rush |year=1988 |title=The Best Kept Secret: Sexual Abuse of Children |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs |isbn=978-0070542235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the [[National Organization for Women]] ([[National Organization for Women|NOW]]) began in 1966 to seek women's equality, including through the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] ([[Equal Rights Amendment|ERA]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://now.org/about/history/statement-of-purpose/|title=The National Organization for Women's 1966 Statement of Purpose}}&lt;/ref&gt; which did not pass, although [[Equal Rights Amendment#State constitutions|some states enacted their own]]. [[Reproductive rights]] in the U.S. centred on the court decision in [[Roe v. Wade|''Roe'' v. ''Wade'']] enunciating a woman's right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to term. Western women gained more reliable [[birth control]], allowing family planning and careers. The movement started in the 1910s in the U.S. under [[Margaret Sanger]] and elsewhere under [[Marie Stopes]]. In the final three decades of the 20th century, Western women knew a new freedom through [[birth control]], which enabled women to plan their adult lives, often making way for both career and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1676.html|title=Margaret Sanger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[division of labor|division of labour]] within households was affected by the increased entry of women into workplaces in the 20th century. Sociologist [[Arlie Russell Hochschild]] found that, in two-career couples, men and women, on average, spend about equal amounts of time working, but women still spend more time on housework,&lt;ref name="Hochschild1"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Hochschild, Arlie Russell |author2=Machung, Anne |title=The Second Shift |year=2003 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York  |isbn=978-0-14-200292-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hochschild2"&gt;{{Cite book |author=Hochschild, Arlie Russell |title=The Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work |year=2001 |publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Co. |location=New York  |isbn=978-0-8050-6643-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; although [[Cathy Young]] responded by arguing that women may prevent equal participation by men in housework and parenting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2000/06/12/gatekeeping/|title=The Mama Lion at the Gate |accessdate=17 December 2015 |publisher=Salon.com |author=Young, Cathy |authorlink=Cathy Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judith K. Brown writes, "Women are most likely to make a substantial contribution when subsistence activities have the following characteristics: the participant is not obliged to be far from home; the tasks are relatively monotonous and do not require rapt concentration; and the work is not dangerous, can be performed in spite of interruptions, and is easily resumed once interrupted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Judith K. | last = Brown | title = A Note on the Division of Labor by Sex | date = October 1970 | volume = 72 | issue = 5 | pages = 1073–78 | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | doi=10.1525/aa.1970.72.5.02a00070}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In international law, the ''[[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]'' (CEDAW) is an international convention adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and described as an international [[bill of rights]] for women. It came into force in those nations ratifying it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CEDAW.aspx|title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women New York, 18 December 1979 |publisher=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jurisprudence ===
{{Main|Feminist legal theory}}

Feminist jurisprudence is a branch of [[jurisprudence]] that examines the relationship between women and law. It addresses questions about the history of legal and social biases against women and about the enhancement of their legal rights.&lt;ref name="blacks"&gt;{{cite book |year=2014 |editor-last=Garner |editor-first=Bryan |editor-link=Bryan A. Garner |title=Black's Law Dictionary |edition=10th |location=St. Paul, Minn. |publisher=Thomson Reuters |page=985 |isbn=978-0-314-61300-4 |quote=Feminist jurisprudence examines ... the history of legal and social biases against women, the elimination of those biases in modern law, and the enhancement of women's legal rights and recognition [status] in society.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist jurisprudence signifies a reaction to the [[Philosophy of law|philosophical approach]] of modern [[Law#Legal theory|legal scholars]], who typically see law as a process for interpreting and perpetuating a society's universal, gender-neutral ideals. Feminist legal scholars claim that this fails to acknowledge women's values or legal interests or the harms that they may anticipate or experience.&lt;ref name="minda"&gt;{{cite book |last=Minda |first=Gary |year=1995 |title=Postmodern Legal Movements: Law and Jurisprudence at Century's End |publisher=[[New York University Press|NYU Press]] |location=N.Y.C. |isbn=978-0814755105 |pages=129–30 |quote=Feminist legal scholars, despite their differences, appear united in claiming that 'masculine' jurisprudence ... fails to acknowledge, let alone respond to, the interests, values, fears, and harms experienced by women.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist theology is a movement that reconsiders the traditions, practices, scriptures, and theologies of religions from a feminist perspective. Some of the goals of feminist theology include increasing the role of women among the clergy and religious authorities, reinterpreting male-dominated imagery and language about God, determining women's place in relation to career and motherhood, and studying images of women in the religion's sacred texts.&lt;ref name=Bundesen&gt;{{cite book |author=Bundesen, Lynne |title=The Feminine Spirit: Recapturing the Heart of Scripture |publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=978-0-7879-8495-3|date=2007-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian feminism]] is a branch of feminist theology which seeks to interpret and understand Christianity in light of the [[Christian egalitarianism|equality]] of [[Women in Christianity|women]] and men, and that this interpretation is necessary for a complete understanding of Christianity. While there is no standard set of beliefs among Christian feminists, most agree that God does not discriminate on the basis of sex, and are involved in issues such as the [[ordination of women]], male dominance and the balance of parenting in [[Christian views on marriage|Christian marriage]], claims of moral deficiency and inferiority of women compared to men, and the overall treatment of women in the church.&lt;ref name=Haddad&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haddad, Mimi |title=Egalitarian Pioneers: Betty Friedan or Catherine Booth? |journal=Priscilla Papers |volume=20 |issue=4 |date=2006 |url=http://www.cbeinternational.org/sites/default/files/pp204_10ep.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713193304/http://www.cbeinternational.org/sites/default/files/pp204_10ep.pdf |archivedate=13 July 2015  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=andeson&gt;{{cite book |author=Anderson, Pamela Sue |author2=Clack, Beverley |title=Feminist philosophy of religion: critical readings |year=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-25749-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian [[Women in the Bible|Bible refers to women]] in positions of authority in [[Book of Judges|Judges]] 4:4 and [[Books of Kings|Kings]] 22:14.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Judges|4:4|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|22:14|NASB}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary inline|date=April 2016}}

[[Islamic feminism|Islamic feminists]] advocate women's rights, [[gender equality]], and [[social justice]] grounded within an Islamic framework.

[[Buddhist feminism]] is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and [[social status]] of [[Women in Buddhism|women within Buddhism]]. It is an aspect of [[feminist theology]] which seeks to advance and understand the equality of men and women morally, socially, spiritually, and in leadership from a Buddhist perspective. The Buddhist feminist [[Rita Gross]] describes Buddhist feminism as "the radical practice of the co-humanity of women and men."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Buddhism After Patriarchy: A Feminist History, Analysis, and Reconstruction of Buddhism|last= Gross|first= Rita M.|year= 1992|publisher= [[State University of New York Press]]|location= Albany, New York|isbn= 978-0-7914-1403-3|page= 127|accessdate=7 October 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B3eurUjHo1IC&amp;pg=PA127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jewish feminism]] is a movement that seeks to improve the religious, legal, and social status of [[Women in Judaism|women]] within Judaism and to open up new opportunities for religious experience and leadership for Jewish women. The main issues for early Jewish feminists in these movements were the exclusion from the all-male prayer group or ''[[minyan]]'', the exemption from positive time-bound ''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'', and women's inability to function as witnesses and to initiate [[Jewish view of marriage#Divorce|divorce]].&lt;ref name=Plaskow1997&gt;{{cite book |author=Plaskow, Judith |editor=Frank, Daniel H. |others=Leaman, Oliver |title=History of Jewish philosophy |year=2003 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-32469-4 |chapter=Jewish Feminist Thought}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Jewish women have become leaders of feminist movements throughout their history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Forward Magazine |title= Why are there so many Jewish feminists? |author= Marjorie Ingall |url= http://forward.com/articles/2305/why-are-there-so-many-jewish-feminists/ |date= 18 November 2005 |accessdate= 31 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patriarchy is a social system in which society is organized around male authority figures. In this system fathers have authority over women, children, and property. It implies the institutions of male rule and privilege, and is dependent on female subordination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of sex and gender |year=2007 |publisher=Macmillan Reference |location=Detroit, Mich.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most forms of feminism characterize patriarchy as an unjust social system that is oppressive to women. [[Carole Pateman]] argues that the patriarchal distinction "between masculinity and femininity is the political difference between freedom and subjection."&lt;ref&gt;Pateman, Carole (1988). ''The Sexual Contract'', Stanford: Stanford University Press, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[feminist theory]] the concept of patriarchy often includes all the social mechanisms that reproduce and exert male dominance over women. Feminist theory typically characterizes patriarchy as a social construction, which can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tickner, Ann J.|chapter=Patriarchy|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy: Entries PZ|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=2001|isbn=978-0-415-24352-0|pages=1197–98|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSmU3aXWIAYC&amp;pg=PA1197}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some [[radical feminism|radical feminists]] have proposed that because patriarchy is too deeply rooted in society, [[Separatist feminism|separatism]] is the only viable solution.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Hoagland, Lesbian Ethics: toward new value&lt;/ref&gt; Other feminists have criticized these views as being anti-men.&lt;ref&gt;Friedan, Betty.

=== Men and masculinity ===
{{main|Men and feminism}}
Feminist theory has explored the social construction of masculinity and its implications for the goal of gender equality. The social construct of masculinity is seen by feminism as problematic because it associates males with aggression and competition, and reinforces patriarchal and unequal gender relations.&lt;ref name="Faludi" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tong |first=Rosemarie Putnam |title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction |location=Boulder, Colo. |publisher=Westview Press |edition=2nd |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-8133-3295-6 |page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patriarchal cultures are criticized for "limiting forms of masculinity" available to men and thus narrowing their life choices.&lt;ref name="Gardiner"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gardiner |first1=Judith Kegan |title=Masculinity studies and feminist theory |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-231-12278-8 |pages =96, 153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some feminists are engaged with men's issues activism, such as bringing attention to male rape and spousal battery and addressing negative social expectations for men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Uviller | first1 = Rena K. | year = 1978 | title = Fathers' Rights and Feminism: The Maternal Presumption Revisited | url = | journal = Harv.

Different groups of people have responded to feminism, and both men and women have been among its supporters and critics.

=== Pro-feminism ===
{{main|Pro-feminism}}
Pro-feminism is the support of feminism without implying that the supporter is a member of the feminist movement. The term is most often used in reference to men who are actively supportive of feminism. The activities of pro-feminist men's groups include anti-violence work with boys and young men in schools, offering sexual harassment workshops in workplaces, running community education campaigns, and counselling male perpetrators of violence. Pro-feminist men also may be involved in men's health, activism against pornography including anti-pornography legislation, [[men's studies]], and the development of gender equity curricula in schools. This work is sometimes in collaboration with feminists and women's services, such as domestic violence and rape crisis centres.&lt;ref name=Lingard&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Lingard |first1=Bob |last2=Douglas |first2=Peter |title=Men Engaging Feminisms: Pro-Feminism, Backlashes and Schooling |year=1999 |publisher=Open University Press |location=Buckingham, England |isbn=978-0-335-19818-4 |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimmel-Tide"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Kimmel |first1=Michael S. |authorlink1=Michael Kimmel |last2=Mosmiller |first2=Thomas E. |title=Against the Tide: Pro-Feminist Men in the United States, 1776–1990: A Documentary History |year=1992 |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-8070-6767-3}}{{page needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Antifeminism}}
Anti-feminism is opposition to feminism in some or all of its forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Simpson | first1 = John A. | last2 = Weiner | first2 = Edmund S.C. | author-link1 = John Simpson (lexicographer) | author-link2 = Edmund Weiner | contribution = Anti-feminist | editor-last1 = Simpson | editor-first1 = John A. | editor-last2 = Weiner | editor-first2 = Edmund S.

In the nineteenth century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on opposition to women's suffrage. Later, opponents of women's entry into institutions of higher learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women's entry into the labour force, or their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWj5OBvTh1IC&amp;pg=PA35 |chapter=Antifeminism |first=Michael |last=Kimmel |authorlink=Michael Kimmel | editor-last1 = Kimmel | editor-first1 = Michael | editor-last2 = Aronson | editor-first2 = Amy | editor-link1 = Michael Kimmel | editor-link2 = Amy Aronson | title = Men and masculinities a social, cultural, and historical encyclopedia | pages = 35–37 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, California | year = 2004 | isbn = 9781576077740 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people have opposed feminism on the grounds that they believe it is contrary to traditional values or religious beliefs. These anti-feminists argue, for example, that social acceptance of divorce and non-married women is wrong and harmful, and that men and women are fundamentally different and thus their different traditional roles in society should be maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Lukas | first = Carrie | author-link = Carrie Lukas | contribution = Marriage: happier ever after | editor-last = Lukas | editor-first = Carrie | editor-link = Carrie Lukas | title = The politically incorrect guide to women, sex, and feminism | page = 75 | publisher = Regency Publishing | location = Washington, DC Lanham, Maryland | year = 2006 | isbn = 9781596980037 | quote = Feminists' assault on marriage also has played a role in devaluing marriage.

This goal must be achieved at any at all costs – to the woman herself, to the baby, to the family, and to society. Women must be made equal to men in their ability ''not'' to become pregnant and ''not'' to be expected to care for babies they may bring into the world. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other anti-feminists oppose women's entry into the workforce, political office, and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gottfried |first=Paul | author-link = Paul Gottfried |title=The trouble with feminism  |url=https://www.lewrockwell.com/2001/04/paul-gottfried/the-trouble-with-feminism/ | work = [[LewRockwell.com]] (web magazine) |publisher= [[Lew Rockwell]] |date= 21 April 2001 |accessdate=30 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = al-Qaradawi | first = Yusuf | author-link = Yusuf al-Qaradawi | contribution = Women and family in Islamist discourses: 'When Islam prohibits something, it closes all the avenues of approach to it'| editor-last = Calvert | editor-first = John | editor-link = John Calvert (scholar) | title = Islamism: a documentary and reference guide | page = 62 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Conn | year = 2008 | isbn = 9780313338564 | quote = Islamists are aggrieved at the support of ostensibly Muslim governments for the 'alleged' legal emancipation of women, including granting women the right to vote and hold public office, in addition to limited rights to initiate divorce.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9120">In [[mathematics]], '''fuzzy measure theory''' considers generalized [[measure (mathematics)|measure]]s in which the additive property is replaced by the weaker property of monotonicity.  The central concept of fuzzy measure theory is the fuzzy measure (also ''capacity'', see &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|author         = Gustave Choquet
|author-link         = Gustave Choquet
|title          = Theory of Capacities
|journal        = Annales de l'Institut Fourier
|volume         = 5
|pages          = 131–295
|year           = 1953
}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which was introduced by [[Gustave Choquet|Choquet]] in 1953 and independently defined by Sugeno in 1974 in the context of [[Sugeno integral|fuzzy integrals]].  There exists a number of different classes of fuzzy measures including [[Dempster-Shafer theory|plausibility/belief]] measures; [[Possibility theory|possibility/necessity]] measures; and [[probability measure|probability]] measures which are a subset of [[measure (mathematics)|classical]] measures.

==Definitions==
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[universe of discourse]], &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; be a [[Class (mathematics)|class]] of [[subset]]s of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;E,F\in\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.  A [[function (mathematics)|function]] &lt;math&gt;g:\mathcal{C}\to\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; where

# &lt;math&gt;\emptyset \in \mathcal{C} \Rightarrow g(\emptyset)=0&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;E \subseteq F \Rightarrow g(E)\leq g(F)&lt;/math&gt;

is called a ''fuzzy measure''. 
A fuzzy measure is called ''normalized'' or ''regular'' if &lt;math&gt;g(\mathbf{X})=1&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;!--
Adding some examples of fuzzy measures--&gt;

==Properties of fuzzy measures==

For any &lt;math&gt; E,F \in \mathcal{C} &lt;/math&gt;, a fuzzy measure is:

* '''additive''' if  &lt;math&gt; g(E \cup F) = g(E) + g(F). &lt;/math&gt;  for all &lt;math&gt;  E \cap F = \emptyset &lt;/math&gt;;
* '''supermodular''' if &lt;math&gt;g(E \cup F) + g(E \cap F) \geq g(E) + g(F)&lt;/math&gt;;
*  '''[[submodular]]''' if  &lt;math&gt;g(E \cup F) + g(E \cap F) \leq g(E) + g(F)&lt;/math&gt;;
*  '''superadditive''' if  &lt;math&gt;g(E \cup F) \geq g(E) + g(F)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;E \cap F = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;;
*  '''subadditive''' if  &lt;math&gt;g(E \cup F) \leq g(E) + g(F)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;E \cap F = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;;
*  '''symmetric''' if &lt;math&gt;|E| = |F|&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt; g(E) = g(F)&lt;/math&gt;;
*  '''Boolean''' if &lt;math&gt; g(E) = 0 &lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; g(E) = 1 &lt;/math&gt;.

Understanding the properties of fuzzy measures is useful in application.  When a fuzzy measure is used to define a function such as the [[Sugeno integral]] or [[Choquet integral]], these properties will be crucial in understanding the function's behavior.  For instance, the Choquet integral with respect to an additive fuzzy measure reduces to the [[Lebesgue integral]].  In discrete cases, a symmetric fuzzy measure will result in the [[Ordered weighted averaging aggregation operator|ordered weighted averaging]] (OWA) operator.  Submodular fuzzy measures result in convex functions, while supermodular fuzzy measures result in concave functions when used to define a Choquet integral.

==Möbius representation==
Let ''g'' be a fuzzy measure, the Möbius representation of ''g'' is given by the set function ''M'', where for every &lt;math&gt; E,F \subseteq X &lt;/math&gt;, 
:&lt;math&gt;M(E) = \sum_{F \subseteq E} (-1)^{|E \backslash F|} g(F).&lt;/math&gt;
The equivalent axioms in Möbius representation are:

# &lt;math&gt; M(\emptyset)=0&lt;/math&gt;.
# &lt;math&gt; \sum_{F \subseteq E|i \in F} M(F) \geq 0&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt; E \subseteq \mathbf{X} &lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt; i \in E &lt;/math&gt;

A fuzzy measure in Möbius representation  ''M'' is called ''normalized''
if &lt;math&gt;\sum_{E \subseteq \mathbf{X}}M(E)=1.&lt;/math&gt;

Möbius representation can be used to give an indication of which subsets of '''X''' interact with one another.  For instance, an additive fuzzy measure has Möbius values all equal to zero except for singletons.    The fuzzy measure ''g'' in standard representation can be recovered from the Möbius form using the Zeta transform:

:&lt;math&gt;  g(E) = \sum_{F \subseteq E} M(F), \forall E \subseteq \mathbf{X} .&lt;/math&gt;

==Simplification assumptions for fuzzy measures==

Fuzzy measures are defined on a [[semiring|semiring of sets]] or [[monotone class]] which may be as granular as the [[power set]] of '''X''', and even in discrete cases the number of variables can as large as 2&lt;sup&gt;|'''X'''|&lt;/sup&gt;.  For this reason, in the context of [[multi-criteria decision analysis]] and other disciplines, simplification assumptions on the fuzzy measure have been introduced so that it is less computationally expensive to determine and use.  For instance, when it is assumed the fuzzy measure is ''additive'', it will hold that &lt;math&gt; g(E) = \sum_{i \in E} g(\{i\}) &lt;/math&gt; and the values of the fuzzy measure can be evaluated from the values on '''X'''.  Similarly, a ''symmetric'' fuzzy measure is defined uniquely by |'''X'''| values.  Two important fuzzy measures that can be used are the Sugeno- or &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-fuzzy measure and ''k''-additive measures, introduced by Sugeno&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively.

===Sugeno ''&amp;lambda;''-measure===

The Sugeno &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-measure is a special case of fuzzy measures defined iteratively. It has the following definition:

====Definition====
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{X} = \left\lbrace x_1,\dots,x_n  \right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt;  be a finite set and let &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in (-1,+\infty)&lt;/math&gt;. A '''Sugeno &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-measure''' is a function &lt;math&gt;g:2^X\to[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; such that

# &lt;math&gt;g(X) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.
# if &lt;math&gt;A, B\subseteq \mathbf{X}&lt;/math&gt; (alternatively &lt;math&gt;A, B\in 2^{\mathbf{X}}&lt;/math&gt;) with &lt;math&gt;A \cap B = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;g(A \cup B) =g(A)+g(B)+\lambda g(A)g(B)&lt;/math&gt;.

As a convention, the value of g at a singleton set &lt;math&gt;\left\lbrace x_i \right\rbrace &lt;/math&gt;
is called a density and is denoted by &lt;math&gt;g_i = g(\left\lbrace x_i \right\rbrace)&lt;/math&gt;. In addition, we have that &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the property

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda +1 = \prod_{i=1}^n (1+\lambda g_i) &lt;/math&gt;.

|issue         = 3
}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Wang and Klir have showed that once the densities are known, it is possible to use the previous [[polynomial]] to obtain the values of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; uniquely.

===''k''-additive fuzzy measure===

The ''k''-additive fuzzy measure limits the interaction between the subsets &lt;math&gt; E \subseteq X &lt;/math&gt; to size &lt;math&gt;|E|=k&lt;/math&gt;.  This drastically reduces the number of variables needed to define the fuzzy measure, and as ''k'' can be anything from 1 (in which case the fuzzy measure is additive) to '''X''', it allows for a compromise between modelling ability and simplicity.

====Definition====

A discrete fuzzy measure ''g'' on a set '''X''' is called ''k-additive'' (&lt;math&gt; 1 \leq k \leq |\mathbf{X}|&lt;/math&gt;) if its Möbius representation verifies &lt;math&gt;M(E) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, whenever &lt;math&gt; |E| &gt; k &lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt; E \subseteq \mathbf{X} &lt;/math&gt;, and there exists a subset ''F'' with ''k'' elements such that &lt;math&gt; M(F) \neq 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

==Shapley and interaction indices==

In [[game]] theory, the [[Shapley value]] or Shapley index is used to indicate the weight of a game.  Shapley values can be calculated for fuzzy measures in order to give some indication of the importance of each singleton.  In the case of additive fuzzy measures, the Shapley value will be the same as each singleton.

For a given fuzzy measure ''g'', and &lt;math&gt;|\mathbf{X}|=n&lt;/math&gt;, the Shapley index for every &lt;math&gt; i,\dots,n \in X &lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt; \phi (i) = \sum_{E \subseteq \mathbf{X} \backslash \{i\}} \frac{(n-|E|-1)!|E|!}{n!} [g(E \cup \{i\}) - g(E)]. &lt;/math&gt;

The Shapley value is the vector &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\phi}(g) = (\psi(1),\dots,\psi(n)).&lt;/math&gt;

{{TOC right}}

==Andorra==
{{Main|Andorra#Fire brigade}}
The Andorran Fire Brigade, with headquarters at [[Santa Coloma d'Andorra|Santa Coloma]], operates from four modern fire stations, and has a staff of around 120 firefighters. The service is equipped with 24 fire service vehicles - 16 heavy appliances (fire tenders, turntable ladders, and specialist four-wheel drive vehicles), four light support vehicles (cars and vans), and four ambulances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=64 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722172143/http://www.bombers.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=64 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 July 2012 |title=Vehicle details with extensive photo gallery here |publisher=Bombers.ad |date= |accessdate=26 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Service is provided full-time, with five fire crews on station on a shift basis, and other firefighters available on call.

==Australia==
In Australia, fire services are state/territory organisations.

In several states, there are three principal fire burning organisations. One is salaried and (primarily) handles urban areas, one is (primarily) volunteer and (primarily) handles rural areas, and one handles government managed public land (mainly forests and plantations).

In the Australian Capital Territory:
*[[Australian Capital Territory Fire Brigade]]
*[[ACT Rural Fire Service]]

In New South Wales:
*[[Fire and Rescue NSW]]
*[[NSW Rural Fire Service]]

In the Northern Territory:
*[[Northern Territory Fire and Rescue Service]]
*[[Bushfires NT]]

In Queensland:
*[[Queensland Fire and Emergency Services]]
*[[Rural Fire Service Queensland]] (now under Queensland Fire and Emergency Services)

In South Australia:
*[[Metropolitan Fire Service]]
*[[Country Fire Service]]

In Tasmania:
*[[Tasmania Fire Service]]

In Victoria:
*[[Country Fire Authority]]
*[[Metropolitan Fire Brigade (Melbourne)]]
*[[Department of Sustainability and Environment]]

In Western Australia, [[DFES]] is the overarching body.  The fire services consist of:
*Career Fire and Rescue Service - salaried staff.  Abbreviated to FRS or CFRS.
*Volunteer Fire and Rescue Service.  Abbreviated to VFRS.
*Volunteer Bush Fire Service.  Abbreviated to BFS.
*Volunteer Fire Service - VFRS and BFS combined and abbreviated to VFS.
*Volunteer Emergency Service Brigades - VFRS, BFS, [[State Emergency Service]] and/or Volunteer Marine Rescue. Abbreviated to VES and previously called FESA units.

DFES funds the CFRS and VFRS vehicles, stations, equipment and training. Local government funds the others. Money for local government is sourced through the Emergency Services Levy.

==Austria==
The structure in [[Austria]] is similar to that of [[Germany]]. There are just six career fire services in [[Vienna]], [[Graz]], [[Innsbruck]], [[Klagenfurt]], [[Salzburg]] and [[Linz]]. As of 2007, some 4,527 volunteer fire departments, the back-bone of the Austrian fire service, relied on about 320,000 men and women voluntary firefighters as active members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesfeuerwehrverband.at/oebfv/index.php?id=154 Österreichischer Bundesfeuerwehrverband: Statistik des ÖBFV&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228111522/http://www.bundesfeuerwehrverband.at/oebfv/index.php?id=154 |date=2008-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire departments exist in even the smallest Austrian villages, where they contribute to community life, usually by organizing fairs and other fund-raising activities. Larger departments in towns from a few thousand to up to 100,000 inhabitants also still largely rely on volunteers, yet some are nowadays forced to have one or more ''de facto'' career firefighters, employed by the municipality and conscripts who can chose for this [[Zivildienst in Austria|compulsory community service]] instead of the compulsory [[military service]], for daily maintenance duties and to increase the availability of personnel during working hours. This is necessary, as such larger departments usually have to deal with several hundred interventions per year. In addition to volunteers and career departments, some 328 companies are required by law to run their own fire service, which may be manned by career firefighters and/or part timers who normally work on ordinary jobs in the company. This includes major airports, oil refineries, petro-chemical factories and many other businesses, even hospitals and clinics. Those departments are usually integrated in the contingency plans of the area and may therefore be called upon for reinforcing the volunteer departments outside the company grounds as well.

== Belgium ==
{{unreferenced|date=June 2018|section}}
In Belgium, fire departments (Dutch: ''Brandweerdienst'', French: ''Service d'Incendie'') are still mainly funded by the community or local government. However, starting January 1, 2015, the Reformation of Fire Departments and Civil Protection (Dutch: ''Hervorming van de Civiele Veiligheid'') was complete. From then on, the fire departments will be grouped into 32 'Rescue Zones'. These can be looked at as a corporation that is partly self-reliant, but with funding by the federal government. This reformation was issued after the gas explosion of Ghislenghien in 2004, where it became apparent that equipment and procedures were outdated. Belgian fire fighter academies have begun adapting newer techniques, such as the Swedish techniques for structural firefighting or USA's RIT-procedure (''Rapid Intervention Team''). One of the first measures of the reformation put into action was the SAH (Dutch: ''Snelste Adequate Hulpverlening''), meaning that, regardless of territorial boundaries, the fire department who can arrive at the scene the fastest with the most adequate equipment (one driver, one petty officer and four fire fighters) will be the first one to turn out and handle the call until the department who has jurisdiction arrives.

Belgium relies on about 17,000 fire fighters in total, consisting of around 5,000 professional fire fighters (mainly in larger cities) and 12,000 volunteers. Also, almost all EMS interventions in Belgium are carried out by fire departments, more specifically fire fighters who have successfully completed their EMS formation. In some departments fire fighters are obligated to take the EMS formation or even get a permit to drive a truck. Belgium uses a military ranking system, going from ''fire fighter'' all the way to ''colonel'' - mirroring the French system.

One exception to the Belgian fire departments is ''Brussels Capital Region''. Since the Brussels Regional Government has its own service directing and managing both EMS and fire services, they frequently tend to have other procedures and regulations. For example: in Brussels fire fighters are equipped with orange turn-out gear and officers wear black gear, whereas the rest of Belgium uses this the other way around. The governmental organ responsible for this organisation is called the Fire and Urgent Medical Aid Service (Dutch: ''DBDMH'', ''Dienst voor Brandbestrijding en Dringende Medische Hulpverlening'', French: ''SIAMU'', ''Service d'Incendie et l'Aide Medicale Urgente'')

==Botswana==
{{unreferenced|date=June 2018|section}}
Fire brigades are run at municipality or council level under the Ministry of Local Government and Service Management of the Republic of Botswana. There are 13 fire stations and two sub-fire stations across every city, Town and major village. Fire Service Act 40.1 aimed at saving lives, protection of property and rendering of humanitarian services to the public, extinguishing fires in buildings and offering extrication to all victims of vehicle collisions across all national highways. Most of these fire brigades are run under British Standard and American structures according to the geographic location. There are also influential supporting fire brigades owned by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), Defense Force and police. Recently the country was able to train more than 100 firefighters in Australia based only on saving the forests and natures of Botswana run under the Forestry Department.

Almost all fire brigades have divisions similar to Britain:
* Administration
* Operations 
* Fire Prevention and Public Education
* Fire Training and Technical Division
* Fire Investigation
* Disaster Management Division

All these divisions are vital in the development of fire brigades in Botswana. There are more than 800 full-time working firefighters and 180 paramedics offering pre-hospital care, serving a population of more than 2 million. As in many developing countries, Botswana's government plays an important role in the purchasing of fire engines and fire equipment.

== Brazil ==
In Brazil, fire services are militarized like some fire departments of France. The "Corpos de bombeiros", or fire fighting corps, is an integral part of the military police. In Brazil military police perform regular police duties throughout the country. This means that in for example the State of São Paulo, people cannot just join the fire brigade. They are first of all policemen, performing the duties of a fire fighter. Each state has its own [[Military Firefighters Corps (Brazil)|Military Firefighters Corps]] (in Portuguese: ''Corpo de Bombeiros Militar''). Cities of southern Brazil, with traditional German communities, have had volunteer fire fighters since the nineteenth century.

Over all, fire fighting in Brazil has been undervalued and underfunded by the government, leading to overstretched areas to attend, constant failure of material and shifting of personnel towards police duties.

Private entities that require fire fighters by law hire them from the private market. These fire fighters are trained by private schools. The great level of corruption of private fire fighting schools and consequent incompetence of private fire fighters, or Bombeiro civil, has led towards the Policia militar, or military police, taking control over the accreditation of private fire fighting schools since October 23, 2013.

==Canada==
Large cities and most towns have full-time fire departments and firefighters (''Service de sécurité incendie'' and ''pompiers'' in Quebec and other French speaking areas in Canada). Smaller towns and other municipalities employ part-time volunteer firefighters. All municipal fire departments are publicly operated. Private companies do operate for fire protection on private property (mostly aerospace companies and refineries). Airport fire departments are operated by local airport authorities with assistance from local departments if needed. The [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] has its own firefighters on [[Canadian Forces]] bases for security reasons. Some provinces have designated firefighting crews specially equipped to handle [[forest fire]]s. Cities and towns along waterways have marine fire capability and the former likely have [[fireboats]]. The [[Canadian Coast Guard]] provides some marine firefighting capability off Canada's coastline as part of search and rescue operations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccg-gcc.gc.ca/e0004254&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chile==
In [[Chile]], [[firefighters]] are called "bomberos". They are [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s. They also must finance the [[Procurement|acquisition]], [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] and operation of their buildings and equipment (including [[Fire apparatus|fire trucks]]) rather than rely upon government allocations.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} All officers are democratically elected by the volunteers. The government does not finance specialization courses for firefighters. Instead, they have to pay for it on their own. 'Bomberos' is the name given for the firefighters in most Spanish speaking countries ('bomba' is the name of the water pumps).

Founded in 1851, Valparaíso's Fire Department is the oldest of the country. Following it is the Valdivia Fire Department in 1853, Ancud Fire Department in 1856 and Santiago Fire Department established in 1863. Now every city has a fire department, each with its own officers and companies.

Many of the companies were founded by expatriate citizens from European countries such as the Germans, British, Spanish, French and Italians. Many have an online and social media presence as well.

==China==

Most fire departments (fire brigades) are provincial agencies (e.g. [[General Fire Brigade of Guangdong]]) in China, with exceptions in [[Beijing]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] which have their own separate publicly run fire services. Airports in China (including Hong Kong and Macau) also have their own departments. The majority of Chinese firefighters are enlisted personnel in the military police and they serve a fixed term of two years, unless they are promoted to non-commissioned officers or above.

==Costa Rica==
The ''Benemérito Cuerpo de Bomberos de Costa Rica'' (Costa Rica Firefighter Corps) is the institution responsible for firefighting, fire safety and fire prevention. It protects the whole country with 70 firehouses, each with paid and volunteer personnel. Paid firefighters in Costa Rica work 24-hour shifts, while volunteer firefighters must serve at least 40 hours every month.

==Croatia==
According to the Croatian constitution, fire-fighting is a matter of the local municipalities. Professional and volunteer fire-fighters are equal regarding the fulfilling their duties, but the professional fire-fighting units work on bases of the Law of Public Institutions, and the volunteer fire-fighting units on bases of the Law of Associations of Citizens. An additional four fire-fighting intervention-units work in four coastal counties in Dalmatia, and all fire-fighting units are commanded during the summer by the Center in Divulje near Split, all part of the National Directorate for protection and safety.

Specific for Croatia is also the engagement of 1.000 season fire-fighters and additional fire-fighting units on islands to protect them from wildland fires in summer.

Fire-fighting interventions are carried out by:

* 1835 volunteer fire fighting units in municipalities and cities
* 56 volunteer industrial fire fighting units
* 61 public city fire fighting units (professional)
* 34 professional industrial fire fighting units
* 4 intervention units of the Ministry of internal affairs
* Special fire-fighting forces and forces of the anti-fire escadrille of the Ministry of Defense (six Canadairs CL 415, six Air-tractors 802, a Fire Boss, and helicopters of the type Mi-8 and 117-S of the [[Croatian Air Force and Air Defence|Croatian Air Force]])

==Denmark==
In Denmark fire fighting is, by law, a municipal task. Every municipal council are responsible for providing fire fighting and rescue services. The only requirements according to the law for this fire service are that the vehicles have to be manned with the necessary crew for the task at hand and they have to be on the way within five minutes after the alarm has come in.

Every municipality has to perform a risk analysis and based on this maintain a competent fire fighting service. The fire department itself can be run as any one of the following:
*A public fire department managed and run by the municipality either full-time or part-time
*A volunteer fire department contracted by the municipality
*Arrangement with neighbouring municipalities
*Outsourced to a private company (e.g. [[Falck (Denmark)|Falck]])
*Contract with the government run [[Danish Emergency Management Agency]] (DEMA), which has stations in five locations scattered over the country

All fire fighters (''brandmænd'') have the same training, no matter if they are volunteers, full-time professionals or public or private employees. The training takes five weeks and can be taken in several fire fighting schools all over the country.

{{main|Fire fighting in Finland}}

[[Finland|Finnish]] firefighters (''palomiehet'') are organised into professional, half-ordinary and voluntary fire brigades.  Professional firefighters in Finland graduate from one of the two firefighting schools in Finland. Firefighters in half-ordinary and voluntary fire brigades are trained volunteers.

There are approximately 85,000 emergency missions a year in Finland, of which fires account for 18%. According to the Ministry of the Interior, Finnish fire brigades extinguish around 12,000 fires every year. Voluntary fire brigades have a remarkable role in the fire rescue service and cover a large part of Finland's area.

==France==
[[File:BSPP section Bastille Day 2008.jpg|thumb|The [[Paris Fire Brigade]] is a [[French Army]] unit which serves as the fire service for [[Paris]] and certain sites of national strategic importance.]]
French firefighters are called [[Sapeurs-Pompiers]], and reflecting the rural nature of much of the country (wide areas with low density of population), the Volunteer Fire brigade (SPV, ''sapeur-pompier volontaire''), with over 190,000 firefighters is the largest firefighting force in France. In addition to being called out from work to attend an incident, they may be on standby at firestations outside their working hours; the intervention and attending hours are paid by the session. The volunteer fire brigade is also a way to promote the culture of [[civil defense]] and of solidarity amongst the population. The Professional Fire Brigade (SPP, ''sapeur-pompier professionnel'') numbers over 30,000 firefighters, employed by the [[département]]s and working in shifts. In some towns there is a mixture of professionals and volunteers, in others only one or the other.

In Paris and [[Marseille]], the fire brigades are made up of military personnel, but under the control of the [[Ministry of the Interior]] in a similar way to the [[French Gendarmerie|Gendarmes]]. The [[Paris Fire Brigade]] (BSPP) has around 7,000 firefighters, and the [[Marseille Marine Fire Battalion]] (BMPM) has over 2,000.

French firefighters tackle over 3.6 million incidents each year:
* 10% fires,
* 10% [[traffic accident]]s ([[Vehicle extrication|freeing]] the casualties and prehospital care as [[first responder]]s),
* 59% other help to people (mainly prehospital care as [[first responder]]s),
* 21% other incidents (gas escapes, stuck elevators, etc.).

With the [[Emergency medical services in France|SAMU]] (French [[Emergency medical services|EMS]]), they are the backbone of the French [[civil defense]].

==Germany==
{{main|German fire services}}
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Löschzug.jpg|thumb|German [[:de:Löschzug|Löschzug]]]] --&gt;
[[German fire department|German fire brigades]] (''[[Feuerwehr]]'') are organized on a town/village basis, with each town having at least one brigade. In Germany there are about 25,000 local brigades - 24,000 [[:de:Freiwillige Feuerwehr|volunteer fire brigades]] (''Freiwillige Feuerwehr''), 800 [[:de:Werkfeuerwehr|private fire brigades with public accreditation]] (''Werkfeuerwehr''), which mostly protect large industrial complexes or airports, many [[:de:Betriebsfeuerwehr|private fire brigades with no public accreditation]] (''Betriebsfeuerwehr''), and 100 [[:de:Berufsfeuerwehr|public fire brigades]] (''Berufsfeuerwehr'') compulsory by law for large towns and cities. However, public brigades are often supported by and cooperate with volunteer brigades. Some volunteer brigades also have a small core of full-time firefighters paid by local community funds. In very rare cases private individuals can be compelled to participate in a [[Compulsory Fire Service|compulsory fire department]], if there are not enough volunteer fire fighters available. Volunteer fire brigades are usually structured in three brigade categories (''Grundausstattung'', ''Stützpunktfeuerwehren'', ''Schwerpunktfeuerwehren'') depending on size and level of equipment. Many German fire brigades not only provide firefighters, they operate [[emergency medical services]] as well. They are estimated to have a total of 1,300,000 active members.

==Hong Kong==
The [[Hong Kong Fire Services Department|Hong Kong Fire Services Department (HKFSD)]] not only has firefighters, but [[Ambulance|ambulance crews]]. As of 14 May 2005, there are 8,675 uniformed personnel (including ambulancemen/ambulancewomen) and 676 civilian members. Fire Services also provides fire services to [[Hong Kong International Airport]]. [[Government Flying Service]] provides aerial fire fighting capabilities.

The head of HKFSD is called the [[wikt:director|Director]] but not the [[Commissioner]]. Assisted by the Deputy Director, the Director of the HKFSD is the head of three Operational Fire Commands: Hong Kong, [[Kowloon]] and [[New Territories|N.T.]] (i.e. The three Districts). Each of the Commands is under the control of the [[Chief Fire Officer|Chief Fire Officer(CFO)]]. In reality, there is one additional Command: The Heartquarters(HQ), which is under control of the CFO(HQ).

See [http://www.hkfsd.gov.hk/home/eng/index.html here] for more information.

==Hungary==
Some 7000 firemen are serving in Hungary at fire brigade unites founded by Ödön Széchenyi. Most of them are professional municipal firemen who are paid from month to month for their services. They generally work at 24/48-hour shifts, occasionally at 24/72. The second largest number of firemen can be found in the volunteer fire brigades. In Hungary volunteer fire brigades are common organisations established by a local government and a firemen's association. The third section are the units employed in the industrial establishments. These units may be employed full-time or part-time. Their regulation and order of duty (in case of full-time employed) is according to the professional municipal firemen and the level of safety more specialized to the characteristics of the establishment. One of the biggest establishment fire brigade units in the country, world-famous through its firefighting practices, is the FER Fire Brigade Ltd., operated and sustained by MOL Co. petrol industry in [[Százhalombatta]].

==India==
In India municipalities are bound by law to have a fire brigade and participate in a regional fire service. Each city has its own fire brigade. All the industrial corporations also have their own firefighting service. Each airport and seaport has its own firefighting units. The main functions of firefighting service in India are provision of fire protection and of services during emergencies, such as building collapses, drowning cases, gas leakage, oil spillage, road and rail accidents, bird and animal rescues, fallen trees, appropriate action during natural calamities, and providing consultancy in implementing fire protection and fire safety in industries and high rise buildings and other buildings having special fire risks, etc.

==Indonesia==
Firefightning units in Indonesia (''Dinas pemadam kebakaran''/''DPK'' or BPB/Badan Penanggulangan Bencana Daerah) fall under the control of the provincial, city, regency and municipal district/township governments and under the supervision of the Ministry of Home Affairs.

==Republic of Ireland==
In the Republic of Ireland, [[fire services]] are provided on a county-by-county, local authority basis. Apart from a small number of full-time brigades, most fire services operate a [[retained firefighter|retained]] duty system, where firefighters are alerted to the fire station by a pager/alerter system. Retained firefighters are typically on call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week apart from pre-arranged leave. Management and [[fire prevention]] duties (inspections, building assessment etc.) are carried out by a small number of senior officers in each county, usually between 4 and 10 depending on size and population.

An Irish fire brigade attends a wide variety of incidents, spanning from fire calls to flooding incidents to extrication of trapped victims at road incidents. This means that a wide variety of equipment is carried on the first-turnout [[fire engine|appliance]] (ladders, hose, breathing apparatus and extrication equipment as well as a vehicle mounted pump and an 1800-litre water tank), whilst more specialised vehicles - water tankers, rescue tenders, high reach appliances etc. - are stationed at strategic locations.

At border areas, such as [[Donegal]], [[County Louth|Louth]] and so on, local agreements are in place with the [[Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service]] in relation to attending incidents.

==Israel==
{{main|Israel Fire and Rescue Services}}
In Israel, the [[Israel Fire and Rescue Services]] is the sole authority in control of firefighting across the entire country. It also provides rescue services for victims of terrorism, car accidents, and dangerous substance spillages. There are 24 metro regions with central major fire stations along with smaller, supplemental stations in neighboring villages and cities. The Israel fire and rescue services consists of about 1,200 paid, professional firefighters and 200-400 volunteers. Israel also has 6 Hazardous Materials units, although almost all Israeli firefighters are certified at hazardous materials response and handling, many of them receiving training in world-class facilities in the Netherlands.

==Italy==
The ''[[vigili del fuoco]]'', literally the ''Firewatchers'', (official name '''''Corpo nazionale dei vigili del fuoco''''') (CNVVF, '''National Fire-watchers' Corps''') is [[Italy]]'s institutional agency for [[fire and rescue service]]. It is part of the Ministry of Interior's ''Dipartimento dei Vigili del Fuoco, del Soccorso Pubblico e della Difesa Civile'' (Department of Fire Watch, Public Rescue and Civil(ian) Protection). The corps' task is to provide safety for people, animals and property, and to give technical assistance to industries and fire prevention advice.  It also ensures public safety in terrorist emergencies such as chemical, bacteriological, radiological and nuclear attacks.

==Lithuania==
[[Image:Kaunas-Fire Engine.jpg|thumb|Firefighter vehicle in [[Kaunas]], [[Lithuania]]]]
In Lithuania firefighters are called "Ugniagesiai gelbėtojai" and may be summoned by dialing to 112 (Lithuania's main emergency phone). Most of the biggest Lithuania cities are equipped with the newest gear and technique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ve.lt/naujienos/lietuva/vakaru-lietuva/ugniagesiai-gelbetojai-dziaugiasi-naujausia-iranga-1024534/ Ugniagesiai gelbėtojai džiaugiasi naujausia įranga] {{lt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lithuania firefighters vehicles are mostly made in Europe, like: [[Renault]], [[Mercedes-Benz]] or [[MAN SE|MAN]], however some smaller towns still have [[GAZ]] vehicles from Soviet times.

==Japan==
[[Image:Tokyo fire department trucks.jpg|thumb|Vehicles of the [[Tokyo Fire Department]].]]
Japan's first fire service was founded in 1629 during the Edo era, and was called Hikeshi (Japanese: 火消し, ''lit. fire extinguisher''). During the Meiji Period, when Japan opened its doors to the West, the Hikeshi was merged into the police department. During this time period, pumps were imported and domestically produced, and modern firefighting strategies were introduced. In 1948, after World War II, a municipality fire service system was established.

Today, fire services are organized on a city/town/village basis. There are 894 fire headquarters (Japanese: 消防本部) and 3,598 volunteer fire corps (Japanese: 消防団). These have a total of 155,000 active career firefighters and 21,000 vehicles with 4,800 fire houses; 920,000 volunteer firefighters share an additional 51,000 trucks. Overall supervision is under the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications.

==Macau==

Like [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]] has their own fire department, [[Corpo de Bombeiros de Macau]] and trained like their Western counterparts. The fire department also provides fire and rescue services to [[Macau International Airport]].

==The Netherlands==
In The Netherlands municipalities are bound by law to have a fire brigade and participate in a regional fire service. The local brigade is responsible for responding to all incidents; the regional fire service provides a control center and operates the special vehicles. There are 25 "safety Regions". These regions' boundaries are the same for fire, police and ambulance service and most regions have a combined control center. The regions are self-contained and can cope with most incidents, in extreme circumstances other regions will provide assistance. All emergency services rely on a single modern digital national communications network based on the [[Terrestrial Trunked Radio|Tetra]] standard. This makes mutual assistance between regions simple to coordinate. Unlike some other countries the ambulance service is completely separated from the fire service, although the control center is usually shared.

About 75% of all firefighters are volunteers, the rest are career firefighters. Although most firefighters in the Netherlands are volunteers, they all get paid. Volunteers get a small amount of money to compensate the costs, because when called upon, they have to leave their jobs and take risks.

The appearance of emergency vehicles is standardized in order to keep them optimally recognizable for other road users. 
The basic first response unit is an engine manned by a crew of six, a commander, a driver, an attack-team and a [[water supply]] team. Aerial ladder or tower trucks are dispatched when needed. Because it is impractical to build trucks to carry all the possible types, all regional fire services across the nation use a standardized type of containers. These containers are transported by special trucks. The containers are built for specific purposes. There are containers with command and control, hydraulic submersible pumps (up to 8000 litres per minute), hoseline (up to 3&amp;nbsp;km of 150-mm hose), watertank, [[foam]]tank, [[decontamination]], [[Hazmat suit|Hazmat]], [[SCBA|breathing apparatus]], technical rescue, etc.

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, fire protection services are overseen by the [[New Zealand Fire Service Commission]]. The Commission ensures coverage through all jurisdictions nationwide and reports to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

Fire protection for [[Urban area|urban]] and peri-urban areas is provided by the [[New Zealand Fire Service]]. This nationwide organisation was established by the Fire Service Act 1975 from the various urban fire brigades in existence at the time. The Fire Service Act nationalised the service and provided the [[statute|statutory authority]] required to fight and prevent fire and to respond to other emergencies, including [[hazardous substance]] incidents and [[motor-vehicle collision]]s. There are mixture of career fire districts, covering major towns and cities, and [[volunteer fire brigade]]s, covering smaller towns and communities. Each district and brigade is headed by a Chief Fire Officer (CFO), who report via their Area Commander and Regional Commander to the National Commander, the chief operational firefighter of the entire Fire Service. The National Commander reports to the Chief Executive who in turn reports to the NZFSC. The roles of National Commander and Chief Executive may be performed by one person if  suitably qualified for both roles.

The NZFS has a significant role in [[Urban search and rescue|Urban Search and Rescue]] and contributes key resources to New Zealand's three USAR teams, based in [[Auckland]], [[Palmerston North]] and [[Christchurch]]. They also provide first-response medical services as a backup to local Ambulance Services, especially in rural areas.

In rural areas the [http://www.nrfa.org.nz/ National Rural Fire Authority] is responsible for providing fire response, as covered by the Forest and Rural Fires Act 1977.  Rural Fire Brigades are operated by City and District Councils, where each District appoints a Rural Fire Officer who reports to the National Rural Fire Officer, who reports to the NZFSC. Other participants in the New Zealand Fire Service Commission are the [[New Zealand Defence Force]] (responsible for fires on Military land) and the Department of Conservation (Responsible for fires in National Parks). Privately owned forestry areas are responsible for providing their own firefighting means.

There is much cooperation between the various firefighting resources in New Zealand, but it is recognised that current legislation is not very flexible - there are loopholes in the areas of funding and legal liability, among others.  The Department of Internal Affairs is currently in the process of reviewing legislation for Fire and Rescue services in New Zealand, with a view to rewriting both the Fire Service Act and the Forest and Rural Fires Act.

Specialist forest fire fighters from New Zealand are often requested to provide assistance at [[wildfire]] events in Australia and the United States, where their skills in [[incident management]] are utilised within the [[Incident Command System]].

==Norway==
Norway has 433 municipalities and 375 Fire and Rescue Services.

==Panama==
The idea for a volunteer fire brigade in [[Panama]] began in the 1870s and was officially inaugurated on November 28, 1887. Paid firefighters did not appear until May 1, 1909. Fire protection services are divided into regional zones each with its own independent institution. They are overseen by a council of zone directors for the fire departments of the entire country. Zone 1 encompasses [[Panama City]] and its suburbs. It has about 300 permanent, paid firefighters and twice as many volunteers.

==Paraguay==
The [[Paraguyan Firefighting Corps]], established in 1978, serves as the national firefighting service. It is Latin America's youngest national fire service, tasked to provide firefighting, disaster and accident rescue duties.

==Peru==
Founded in 1953, the [[Peruvian General Volunteer Firefighters Corps]] (''Cuerpo General de Bomberos Voluntarios del Perú'') serves as the official firefighting service of the country. It is the central authority for firefighting in Peru. With more than hundreds of municipal and city level departments the PGVFC provides the necessary training and equipment for these fire units.

==Philippines==
{{Main|Bureau of Fire Protection}}
Firefighting and rescue services in the Philippines are, since 1991, handled by the Bureau of Fire Protection of the [[Department of the Interior and Local Government]].

==Portugal==
In Portugal, volunteer fire departments are established in every town: even the biggest Portuguese cities, have volunteer firefighters besides a career fire service. Well-trained and well-equipped fire departments are based in every Portuguese [[municipalities of Portugal|municipality]]. [[Aerial firefighting]] is widely used, especially in the forest. Video-based fire surveillance and remote monitoring systems for real-life application are used, besides fire surveillance outposts placed in strategic locations. Legislation regarding the installation and maintenance of fire detection and control in buildings is enforced. Like all the other [[EU member state]]s, in which under a [[European Union]] civil-protection programme, the [[European Commission]] manages requests for help with a natural disaster and keeps tabs on what resources are available in which member state, Portugal is ready to offer support in firefighting operations in the European Union.

==Singapore==
The [[Singapore Civil Defence Force]] (abbreviation: SCDF; Chinese: 新加坡民防部队) is the main agency in charge of the provision of emergency services in the Republic of Singapore during peacetime and emergency.

A uniformed organization under the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs, the SCDF provides ambulance, firefighting and emergency response services in Singapore. It also plays a major role in the Republic's disaster relief operations.

==Slovenia==

The organization of firefighting in [[Slovenia]] has many similarities with firefighting in Austria, because of the historical influence. The emphasis is on [[volunteer fire department]]s which are non-profit organization by the law. As of 2008, there are 1295 volunteer fire departments and 68 industrial voluntary fire departments with more than 60,000 voluntary firefighters which represent the backbone of firefighting service in Slovenia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasilec.net/ul-priloge/POROCILO%2015.KONGRESU%20GZS.pdf Poročilo 15. kongresa GZS]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{sl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activity of the volunteer fire departments is financially supported by local [[Community (administrative division)|community]], but fire departments are also allowed to collect private donations. The voluntary fire departments are also heavily involved in community activities, especially in smaller towns and villages. The general organization of voluntary firefighting service is named ''[http://www.gasilec.net Gasilska zveza Slovenije]''.

In addition to voluntary firefighters there are also 34 career fire departments (13 of them provide public fire service in bigger cities, the rest of them on main [[airport]]s and big industrial facilities, including power plants) with more than 900 firefighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zspg.si/uvod.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615064123/http://www.zspg.si/uvod.php |archivedate=2009-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These professional firefighters are financially supported by the employers (in industry and at the airports), but public fire departments are supported by local municipalities and  the Slovenian [[Ministry of Defence (Slovenia)|Ministry of Defense]].

Both voluntary and professional firefighters must undergo a formal training to become qualified for the firefighting duty.

==Spain==
Fire brigades in Spain are different in each [[autonomous community]] with the exception of [[Barcelona]] and [[Madrid]] which have their own brigades.
The Fire Brigade of [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] is famous for having created an [[NGO]] called [[Bomberos Sin Fronteras]] (''Firefighters Without Borders'') which helps in any natural disaster that could happen anywhere in the world. There is also a [[Firefighters Museum of Alcoy|Firefighters Museum]], in [[Alcoy, Spain|Alcoy]], ([[Province of Alicante|Alicante]]).

==Sri Lanka==
The fire brigades in [[Sri Lanka]] are based in large cities such as [[Colombo]], [[Kandy]], etc. These units come under the control of each municipal council. Some towns have smaller units. All major airports and harbors maintain their own fire brigades with specialized units and training.

==Switzerland==
In [[Switzerland]], it is common for [[Compulsory Fire Service|compulsory fire service]] duties to be required of both men and women, whether or not they are Swiss. Most fire services in Switzerland are so called Militia Fire Brigades (''Miliz-Feuerwehr''). [[Militia]] firefighters normally pursue other professions, and have active duty only during exercises and missions. In the case of an emergency, the first response is completed by a group of specially-trained police officers. The militia fire brigade arrives as soon as possible. In special situations (major events, demonstrations, etc.) the fire brigade provides a standby service. Currently 95.000 men and women serve as firefighters in 1.500 fire brigades (''Feuerwehrkorps''), Only 1.200 of them are professional firefighters, organized as plant fire brigades or a unit of a larger city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swissfire.ch/fileadmin/swissfire/Der%20SFV/Factsheet_Feuerwehr_2015_d.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Exceptions include for example, the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of [[Zurich]], and in all places where professional fire brigades exist. If a fire brigade cannot find enough volunteers, it can carry out forced recruitment. These drafts are not popular, because the recruited firefighters are generally less motivated. Anyone who rejects service must pay a fire service exemption tax.

==United Kingdom==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Pager]] --&gt;

Fire and rescue services (FRS) in England are organised on a [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] or [[county]] basis, mainly owing to the reorganisation of the counties in 1974.  In [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] they are on a regional basis, with eight and three FRS respectively. [[Northern Ireland]] and, since 2013, [[Scotland]] have single brigades, the [[Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service]] and the [[Scottish Fire and Rescue Service]] respectively. The term fire brigade is largely historical with only a few FRS, including the [[London Fire Brigade]] keeping it in use. The gradual change to the term fire and rescue service has been reinforced by new legislation including the [[Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2004/20040021.htm Fire &amp; Rescue Services Act 2004, Pub: The Stationery Office, Crown copyright] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031030651/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2004/20040021.htm |date=October 31, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which mostly applies to England and Wales. The equivalent legislation in Scotland is the [[Fire (Scotland) Act 2005]]. In rural areas, there are often fire stations manned by part-time [[retained firefighters]]. In addition there are a number of independent fire services, such as the [[Peterborough Volunteer Fire Brigade|Peterborough volunteers]], the [[Down House#Downe House School|Downe House School]] brigade and those run by large industrial concerns. As well as responding to emergencies, UK FRS also have a legal obligation by various [[Acts of Parliament]] covering different parts of the UK, to respond to any emergency, which can pose a threat to life, and the environment. Dealing with [[Urban Search and Rescue]] incidents was incorporated into English law in 2007, FRS are required by law to deal with ''An emergency involving the collapse of a building or other structure..''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Fire&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=3231087&amp;ActiveTextDocId=3231087&amp;filesize=15341 Ministry of Justice, UK Statute Law Database: The Fire &amp; Rescue Services (Emergencies) (England) Order 2007 No735]&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

[[Image:PGFD1.JPG|right|thumb|250 px|Prince George's County Fire Department Engine 553 in the foreground and Ladder 55 in the background parked at a firehouse in [[Brentwood, Maryland]]]]
U.S. firefighters work under the auspices of fire departments (also commonly called fire protection districts, fire divisions, fire companies, fire bureaus, and fire-rescue).  These departments are generally organized as local or [[County (United States)|county]] government subsidiaries, [[special-purpose district]] entities or [[not-for-profit corporation]]s.  They may be funded by the parent government, through millage, fees for services, fundraising or charitable contributions. Some state governments and the federal government operate fire departments to protect their wildlands, e.g., [[California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection]] (CAL FIRE),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fire.ca.gov/fire_er.php CAL FIRE - Fire Protection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Jersey]] Forest Fire Service,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.nj.us/dep/parksandforests/fire/aboutus.html Department of Environmental Protection&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[USDA Forest Service]] – Fire and Aviation Management&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fs.fed.us/fire/ Fire and Aviation Management&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Smokejumper]]). Many military installations, major airports and large industrial facilities also operate their own fire departments.

==Vatican City==
{{Main|Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State}}
The world's smallest country maintains a full-time professional fire service, under the authority of the Directorate for Security Services and Civil Defence. The original ''Guardie dei Fuoco'', established in 1820, was a military fire service, and part of the armed forces of the Papal States. This was reformed in 1941 into the ''Corpo dei vigili del fuoco dello Stato della Città del Vaticano'' or ''Corps of Firefighters of the Vatican City State''. The Corps has its Headquarters at Belvedere Courtyard in the Vatican City, and maintains full-tim cover throughout the year on a rotational shift pattern, staffed by 30 full-time firefighters. There are four principal appliances, plus a number of support vehicles.

==Venezuela==
In [[Venezuela]], there are several types of fire brigades, which are often divided by jurisdiction.  The two main types of fire brigades here are State or Municipal brigades, with many volunteer units existing as well.  One of the most important paid fire departments in Venezuela is the [http://www.bomberoscaracas.gov.ve ''Bomberos Metropolitanos de Caracas''] (Caracas Metropolitan Firefighters).

A fourth type, the University brigade, takes care of any emergency situation on a [[university]] campus.  These brigades are a rapidly growing trend in Venezuela.  An example of such a force is [http://www.ucv.ve/bomberos ''Cuerpo de Bomberos Universitarios de la Universidad Central de Venezuela''] (Venezuela Central University's Firefighter Brigade), which has more than 40 years of service and combined experience.  There are new institutions growing in other universities, such as the [http://bomberos.usb.ve ''Cuerpo de Bomberos Voluntarios de la Universidad Simón Bolívar''] (Simón Bolívar University's Volunteer Firefighter Brigade).

All these firefighting units report directly to the Ministry of Interior and Justice through the [[National Directorate for Civil Protection and Firefighting]].

==Vietnam==

The Vietnam Firefighting Force (Lực lượng Phòng cháy và Chữa cháy Việt Nam) is a component part of [[Vietnam People's Public Security]]. It includes 4 subbranches: Volunteer Fire Militia (Dân phòng Phòng cháy và Chữa cháy), Regular Fire Service (Phòng cháy và Chữa cháy Cơ sở), Special Fire Service (Phòng cháy và Chữa cháy Chuyên ngành) and Fire Police (Cảnh sát Phòng cháy và Chữa cháy).

Vietnam Firefighting Force has important roles in managing, organizing and commanding  firefighting and civil defense duties within Vietnam.

Vietnam Firefighting Force was established on 27 September 1961. As a part of the VPPS, it falls under the command of the [[Ministry of Public Security (Vietnam)]].

Each province of Vietnam has a Fire Office and each local area has a Fire Station under the Provincial Fire Office.

The '''German Forum for Art History Paris''' ('''Deutsches Forum für Kunstgeschichte''' (DFK; Centre Allemand d'Histoire de l'Art de Paris; German Center for the History of Art, Paris) is a [[Germany|German]] research institute specialized in [[France|French]] and [[Germany|German]] art and currently situated in the Hôtel de Lully in [[Paris]], the former residence of the French composer [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]. It organizes conferences, symposia, and workshops, undertakes research projects, and has published many books on art.

The DFK was founded in 1997 with German, French, and Swiss colleagues by [[Thomas W. Gaehtgens]]. It is supported by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research. Until October 2007, the institution was headed by Gaehtgens, from 2009 to 2014 by {{Interlanguage link multi|Andreas Beyer|de}} and since February 2014 by the current director, {{Interlanguage link multi|Thomas Kirchner (Historiker)|de}}. From 2006, the Forum is part of the "Foundation of German Humanities Institutes Abroad", which is now called "Max Weber Foundation of German Humanities Institutes Abroad".

The DFK supports research by [[Germany|German]] scholars on [[France|French]] subjects. It also promotes the research of French scholars on German art and German art history and endeavors to include other [[Europe]]an and [[Americas|transatlantic]] countries and academic disciplines to participate in its research programs.

The DFK cooperates with the [[Institut national d'histoire de l'art]] (INHA) in Paris, the [[Bibliotheca Hertziana – Max Planck Institute for Art History]] in Rome, the [[Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz]] and the [[Zentralinstitut für Kunstgeschichte]] in Munich. It is also member of the [[International Association of Research Institutes in the History of Art]] (RIHA).

'''Goedele Maria Gertrude Liekens''' (born 21 January 1963),&lt;ref name="B&amp;G"&gt;{{nl}} [http://www.beeldengeluidwiki.nl/index.php/Goedele_Liekens Goedele Liekens] Beeld en Geluid wiki, retrieved 30 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[psychologist]] and [[sexologist]].&lt;ref name="Leuven"&gt;{{nl}} [http://nieuws.kuleuven.be/node/14323 Leven na Leuven: seksuologe en presentatrice Goedele Liekens], kuleuven.be, 19 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; She is a former [[Miss Belgium]] (1986) and currently also works as a [[television presenter]], in the [[Netherlands]] as well as her native Belgium. Outside the [[Low Countries]], she may be best known for presenting ''[[Sex in Class]]'' on [[Channel 4]] in the UK, early August 2015. She and [[Steve Jones (presenter)|Steve Jones]] present the second series of ''[[Sex Box]]''.

==Career==
Liekens became famous by winning the Miss Belgium contest in May 1986.&lt;ref name="B&amp;G" /&gt; During the following [[Miss Universe]] contest in [[Panama]] Liekens refused to attend extracurricular events for guests that paid extra for those. She also refused to shake hands with then head of state [[Manuel Noriega]] for his "leading a wrong regime".

Liekens studied psychology and [[sexology]], receiving a degree from the [[Free University of Brussels]] in 1987. She re-attended university in 1991, studying Family and Sexual Studies at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|KU]] in [[Leuven]], earning her degree in 2003. She worked for the sexuality and planned parenthood organisation [[Rutgers Nisso Group]] from 1992 to 1996.&lt;ref name="Leuven" /&gt;

===Media===
Liekens appeared as a sexology expert in several programs of Flemish and Dutch television and did a radio show for a while.&lt;ref name="B&amp;G" /&gt; She got her first show to present in the late 1980s and has done about a dozen since.&lt;ref name="B&amp;G" /&gt; At first her programmes centred on sex and sex education, but from the mid 1990s onwards Liekens hosted other shows as well, like the Flemish version of ''[[International versions of The Weakest Link|Weakest Link]]''. Liekens worked for a variety of stations in Belgium and the Netherlands, most notably the [[Vtm]] and [[RTL 4]].&lt;ref name="B&amp;G" /&gt;

She has published several books on sex-related matters, wrote columns for magazines including [[Playboy]] and has had two magazines of her own. Liekens co-founded the now defunct production company Jok Foe in 2001,&lt;ref name="Leuven" /&gt; which produced various programs, such as ''The Planckaerts'', a reality soap starring former road racing cyclist [[Eddy Planckaert]].

===UNFPA===
Since 1999 Liekens is a [[United Nations Population Fund Goodwill Ambassador]] in the area of [[reproductive health]].&lt;ref name="Leuven" /&gt; In this work she has advocated women's rights,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.unfpa.org/goedele-liekens Goedele Liekens] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20151126115052/http://web.unfpa.org/goedele-liekens |date=26 November 2015 }}, UNFPA.org, retrieved 30 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; helped to fight [[obstetric fistula]] in developing countries and generally argued for a broader sexual education that must include the pleasures of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unfpa.org/news/girls%E2%80%99-rights-goedele-liekens-looks-back-15-years-progress Girls’ rights: Goedele Liekens looks back on 15 years of progress], UNFPA.org, retrieved 30 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Sex in Class''===
In August 2015, Channel 4 aired a show in which Liekens talked to thirteen British [[teenagers]] about sex and [[pornography]].&lt;ref name="LE"&gt;Brunskell-Evans, H. (2015); "[https://theconversation.com/sex-in-class-liekens-is-right-to-teach-teenagers-about-sexual-pleasure-45678 Sex in Class: Liekens is right to teach teenagers about sexual pleasure]"; website Leicester University, retrieved 30 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The one-off programme made headlines across the UK, mainly for her open attitude towards sensitive subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11779957/Sex-in-Class-Channel-4-brings-pornography-into-the-classroom.html Channel 4 sex education documentary brings pornography into the classroom], ''The Telegraph'', 3 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; According to some the show pointed out that British teenagers suffer a serious deficiency in their sex education, a gap they fill by watching [[pornography]], with a horde of misconceptions as a result.&lt;ref name="LE" /&gt; Liekens has argued that the [[General Certificate of Secondary Education]] must include a much broader and mandatory sexual education than at present.&lt;ref name="LE" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5157">'''Greenhouse gas removal''' projects are a type of [[climate engineering]] that seek to remove [[greenhouse gases]] from the atmosphere, and thus they tackle the root cause of [[global warming]].  These techniques either directly remove greenhouse gases, or alternatively seek to influence natural processes to remove greenhouse gases indirectly.  The discipline overlaps with [[carbon capture and storage]] and [[carbon sequestration]], and some projects listed may not be considered to be climate engineering by all commentators, instead being described as [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wigley TM |title=A combined mitigation/geoengineering approach to climate stabilization |journal=Science |volume=314 |issue=5798 |pages=452–4 |date=October 2006 |pmid=16973840 |doi=10.1126/science.1131728 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16973840 |bibcode=2006Sci...314..452W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carbon sequestration==
{{main|Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage|Carbon neutral fuel|Carbon sequestration|Carbon dioxide removal}}
A wide range of techniques for [[carbon sequestration]] exist.  These range from ideas to remove [[carbon dioxide|{{CO2}}]] from the atmosphere ([[carbon dioxide air capture]]), flue gases ([[carbon capture and storage]]) and by preventing carbon in [[biomass]] from re-entering the atmosphere, such as with [[Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage]] (BECCS).

Atmospheric [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC) removal is an idea which suggests using [[lasers]] to break up CFCs, an important family of greenhouse gases, in the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author=Stix, T.H.  |title=Removal of chlorofluorocarbons from the troposphere |booktitle=1993 IEEE International Conference on Plasma Science |page=135 |publisher=[[IEEE]] |date=7–9 Jun 1993 |location=Vancouver, BC, Canada |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=593398&amp;isnumber=12731 |doi=10.1109/PLASMA.1993.593398 |isbn=0-7803-1360-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methane removal==

The '''Gulf of Maine Research Institute''' (GMRI) is a non-profit marine science center and research institute located in [[Portland, Maine]]. The institute promotes stewarding the ecosystem, supporting sustainable seafood, cultivating science literacy, and strengthening coastal communities.&lt;ref name="2012AR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ar2012.gmri.org/|title=2012 Annual Report|accessdate=22 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Established in 1968 to teach about Maine’s fresh and saltwater resources and conduct research on the [[Gulf of Maine]] and its watershed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gmri.org/about/newsItem.asp?ID=48&amp;y=2003&amp;t=1|title=U.S. Coast Guard Transfers Title To Waterfront Property|date=25 Nov 2003|accessdate=22 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, the then Research Institute of the Gulf of Maine (RIGOM) began to build an aquarium, first as a tourist destination, then as a research facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://themainemag.com/people/profiles/2353-alan-lishness.html|title=Alan Lishness Profile|date=Nov 2013|last=Conely|first=Susan|accessdate=22 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the endowed institute promotes ocean stewardship and economic growth in the Gulf of Maine bioregion. Science, Education and Community programs are funded primarily by federal grants and charitable contributions.&lt;ref name="2012AR"/&gt;

The 44,000 sq. ft. Marine research and education laboratory opened in 2005. The institute established a digital learning environment called Vital Signs for Maine school children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmri.org/about/display.asp?a=2&amp;b=1&amp;c=11|title=History &amp; Accomplishments|accessdate=22 Apr 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25368">'''{{Lang|de|Gutmensch}}''' (literally ''good human'' in German) is an [[ironic]], [[sarcastic]] or disparaging cultural term similar to "do-gooder". Those who use the term are implying that ''Gutmenschen'' have an overwhelming wish to be good and eagerly seek approval. Further suggesting a supposed [[morality|moralising]] and proselytising behaviour and being [[dogmatic]]. In political [[rhetoric]] ''Gutmensch'' is used as a [[polemic|polemic term]]. See also [[Stereotype]] or [[Personality]].

==Context==

Users of the term believe that people or groups of people with a specific moral attitude show a wrong or problematic behaviour.&lt;ref name="knobloch"&gt;Clemens Knobloch: ''Moralisierung und Sachzwang. Politische Kommunikation in der Massendemokratie''. Duisburg 1998 (künftig: Knobloch: ''Moralisierung'').&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, it was used as a popular term in the 1980s for people who valued humanistic, [[altruistic]], but also religious and human goals in life higher than [[utilitarian]] ones. They organise their actions, politics as well as their lives accordingly.&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum" /&gt;

The term ''Gutmensch'' is also connected to the term [[political correctness]] and has been used in a derogatory manner since the mid 1990s. In general language use it is always used as a negatively connotated foreign appellation. A use that is meant in "a nice way" can often be found only in face-to-face conversations, such as the saying "to have a heart of gold", in generosity or in an extreme form of [[altruism]].&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katrin Auer: [http://www.oezp.at/pdfs/2002-3-04.pdf "'Political Correctness' – Ideologischer Code, Feindbild und Stigmawort der Rechten."] (PDF; 103&amp;nbsp;kB). In: ''[[Österreichische Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft]]''. Volume 31, Nr. 3, 2002, pp. 291–303, especially p. 294; further: Knobloch: ''Moralisierung'';{{full citation needed|date=July 2016}} Gesa von Leesen: "'Das sagt man nicht!' Political Correctness zwischen Moral und Kampfbegriff". In: ''Das Parlament''. 1 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also hints at the possible difference between "meant well" and "well done". ''Gutmenschen'' have good intentions, want to solve specific problems or have the desire to create a better world. Those who use the term ''Gutmensch'' in a negative way evaluate the actions of ''Gutmenschen'' as not appropriate or unnecessary. This is how the term is used in everyday language. The German dictionary [[Duden]], which included the term in 2000, defines ''Gutmensch'' as "a naive person who acts in an uncritical, exaggerated or tedious way while fighting for political correctness."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duden.de/rechtschreibung/Gutmensch] in duden.de, accessed 24 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and use ==
According to researcher Rembert Hüser, the term ''Gutmensch'' was coined as a joke made by German feuilleton writers of the "generation 1989", such as [[Matthias Horx]] and [[Klaus Bittermann]]. They were among the authors of dictionaries opposing the [[protests of 1968]]. These dictionaries were written in the style of ''Eckardt Henscheids Dummdeutsch'' dictionary (dealing with language criticism) and can be considered a combination of popular and political literature. They did not differentiate between the meaning of a word and how it is used. Bittermann explains in his epilogue of the ''Wörterbuch des Gutmenschen'' (dictionary of the ''Gutmensch''):

{{quote|Literary scientist [[Karl Heinz Bohrer]] wrote at the end of his commentaries, in which he argued against the "terror of conciliation exerted by the provinciality of the Federal Republic of Germany": 'Maybe it would be best, if the [[Merkur (magazine)|Merkur]] established a little dictionary of the ''Gutmensch'', including entries like ''tearing down the wall in our minds'', ''constructive debates'', ''weird thinking'' or ''stubbornness''. We have long been waiting for that to happen, in vain as it turns out. Since things have not improved, we feel like we have to take care of that matter ourselves.'|ref=&lt;ref&gt;Klaus Bittermann (Hrsg.): ''Das Wörterbuch des Gutmenschen. Betroffenheitsjargon und Gesinnungskitsch''. München 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Since the mid 1990s, ''Gutmensch'' has been used alongside [[political correctness]]&lt;ref&gt;Z.&amp;nbsp;B. von [[Reinhard Günzel (general)|Reinhard Günzel]], siehe dort.&lt;/ref&gt; in political and ideological debates, in order to degrade political opponents as over-moralizing.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. Auer: ''"Political Correctness"'', p. 294; Brigitta Huhnke: "'political correctness' – ein Mantra nationaler Erweckung". In: ''ZAG'' 30, 1999 (also in: ''[http://www.zag-berlin.de/antirassismus/archiv/30politicalcorrectness.html ZAG Online]''); Brigitta Huhnke: "'pc' – Das neue Mantra der Neokonservativen". In: Andreas Disselnkötter u.&amp;nbsp;a. (eds.): ''Evidenzen im Fluß. Demokratieverluste in Deutschland''. Duisburg 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former ''[[Merkur (magazine)|Merkur]]'' publisher Kurt Scheel once claimed to have used the term first in that sense.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to the editor by Karl Scheel in the ''[[Frankfurter Rundschau]]'', 19 November 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Herberg u.&amp;nbsp;a.: ''Neuer Wortschatz: Neologismen der 90er Jahre im Deutschen.'' Berlin 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nwzq-xXllkAC&amp;pg=PA148 pp. 148 ''ff'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gutmensch'' was considered the "latest critical chic" in the art sections of newspapers. Writers, like Klaus Bittermann, came up with a variety of [[neologism]]s referring to [[political correctness|PC]] and accompanying the appearance of ''Gutmensch''. Some of them can roughly be translated as ''Gutmensch language'', ''bleeding-heart language'', ''attitudinal kitsch'', ''attitudinal language'' or ''chatter jargon''.

In 2006, the [[Deutscher Journalisten-Verband|German Journalists Association]] claimed that the term ''Gutmensch'' had its origins in [[Nazi Germany]]. Following that claim, the association planned on including the term in a handbook on the sensitive use of language for journalists, which they wanted to publish in cooperation with the Duisburg Institute of Language and Social Studies.&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum"&gt;Jürgen Hoppe/[[Deutscher Journalisten-Verband]]: {{cite web |url=http://www.djv-nrw.de/bilder/Memorandum27.03.06.pdf |title=Memorandum zur "Initiative Journalisten gegen Rassismus" |accessdate=2016-07-20 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928101946/http://www.djv-nrw.de/bilder/Memorandum27.03.06.pdf |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df= }}, 27 March 2006 (accessed 26 October 2007; PDF; 27&amp;nbsp;kB).&lt;/ref&gt; However, some time later the Institute explicitly objected to that claim made by the [[Deutscher Journalisten-Verband|DJV]]. Having conducted their own research on this topic, the Institute concluded that there was no clear connection between ''Gutmensch'' and Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diss-duisburg.de/2011/11/das-stigma-gutmensch/#footnote_1_1036 DISS-Journal] des Duisburger Instituts für Sprach- und Sozialforschung&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in a pre-published sample of the above-mentioned handbook, it was stated that ''Gutmensch'' had been introduced by the Nazis to refer to followers of [[Clemens August Graf von Galen|Cardinal von Galen]], who had openly opposed the [[Action T4|Nazi programme of forced euthanasia]]. According to the [[Deutscher Journalisten-Verband|DJV]], ''Gutmensch'' was derived from the [[Yiddish]] expression "a gutt Mensch" (a good human). Furthermore, they indicated that it was [[Adolf Hitler]], who in his book ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' had repeatedly used the prefix "gut" (good) in a derogatory way, so as to accuse people who expressed goodwill and good-heartedness of collaborating with the German enemies.&lt;ref&gt;Vgl. Adolf Hitler: ''Mein Kampf''. Dort als die "Gutmeinenden" oft synonym für "die Juden", aber auch für Deutsche, die sich nicht eindeutig für oder gegen die nationalsozialistische "Bewegung" entscheiden können. Wie im Falle Nietzsches konnte jedoch auch hier keine Verwendung des Wortes "Gutmensch" dokumentiert werden.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another widespread opinion on where ''Gutmensch'' originates, is that it was [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] who coined it.&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum" /&gt; There are numerous disparaging remarks in Nietzsche's writings concerning the "good human", albeit not as a fixed expression. The [[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache|Association for the German Language]] mentions as their first source a 1985 edition of the [[Forbes|Forbes magazine]], in which Franz Steinkühler, at that time co-chairman of Germany's biggest [[IG Metall|metalworker's union]], is called a ''Gutmensch''.&lt;ref name="gfds"&gt;Gesellschaft für Deutsche Sprache zum ersten Aufscheinen des Begriffs im Deutschen: [http://gfds.de/gutmensch/ ''Fragen und Antworten: Gutmensch''].&lt;/ref&gt;

A more positive link may be [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s play ''[[The Good Person of Szechwan]]'' ({{lang-de|Der gute Mensch von Sezuan|links=no}}) whose main theme is the difficulty of acting good in a world that is not good.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaterbremen.de/de_DE/spielplan/der-gute-mensch-von-sezuan.1090429 Theaterbremen: Der gute Mensch von Sezuan] (accessed 2 January 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Die Welt]]'' journalist Matthias Heine brings into play German pedagogical scientist Christian Oeser, who may have invented the term. In Oeser's book "Letters to a Maiden on the most fundamental Topics of Aesthetics", published in 1859, he writes about naive ''Gutmenschen'' as follows: "Isn't it clear that in the end, such a gullible ''Gutmensch'' will be laughed at for his unconditional love towards humans, that the whole world will call him a fool and that he will eventually fall prey to his own weakness?"&lt;ref name=mh /&gt;

It is worth mentioning that similar terms can be found in other languages as well, for example the Italian ''buonismo'',  with meanings all referring to the ''Gutmensch''.

===In areas critical of society===

Occasionally, people who see themselves as critics of society ironically condemn would-be campaigners who criticize society without applying the same criteria to themselves. The term ''Gutmensch'' sees criticism of [[racism]] as symbolic when the speakers own racist behaviour is not reflected. That kind of criticism means that political utterances which don’t demand consequences are only made to allow the speaker to appear in a good light. Especially Sunday speeches of politicians will be criticized, if they pretend to be advocates for "victims". People who are concerned determinedly reject a locking up into a role as victim.&lt;ref&gt;Siehe Susan Arndt: ''Weißsein. Die verkannte Strukturkategorie Europas und Deutschlands'' und ''Mythen des weißen Subjekts: Verleugnung und Hierarchisierung von Rassismus''. In: Maureen Maisha Eggers u.&amp;nbsp;a. (Hrsg.): ''Mythen, Masken und Subjekte. Kritische Weißseinsforschung in Deutschland''. Münster 2005, pp. 24–29 and p. 340–362.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "friend of foreigners", having good intentions, is a specific example. According to [[humanism|humanistic]] approaches, they think everyone is equal, but foreigners impose their "own needs, ethical and moral ideas and goals" on him (''jemandem etwas aufzwingen, aufdrängen'') Sabine Forschner).&lt;ref&gt;See also Susan Arndt: "Mythen des weißen Subjekts: Verleugnung und Hierarchisierung von Rassismus". In: Maureen Maisha Eggers u.&amp;nbsp;a. (eds.): ''Mythen, Masken und Subjekte. Kritische Weißseinsforschung in Deutschland''. Münster 2005, pp. 340–362&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norbert Bolz]] ([[TU Berlin]]), an academic in media and communication, said in a radio station [[Deutschlandfunk]] on 11 August 2014:

{{quote|''Gutmenschen'' are people who have oral presentation techniques that have been given a name in the last couple of decades, i.e. political correctness. This political correctness can be described precisely and therefore also the ''Gutmensch'' is described; it is composed of political moralisation, from a kind of hygiene of speech, with a vast amount of speech taboo and furthermore, also from a kind of frigidly puritan attitude.|ref=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eben mal die Welt retten!|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.deutschlandradiokultur.de/gutmenschen-eben-mal-die-welt-retten.976.de.html?dram:article_id=294305|format=|accessdate=2015-05-2015|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}} Deutschlandfunk, 11 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==In political debates==

The term is used with a different purpose and frequency in the overall political spectrum, i.e. as a polemic term in a discussion with (actual and would-be) representatives of a "political correctness", but mainly in the field of conservativeness, rightwing populism and rightwing totalitarianism.&lt;ref name="HoppeWDRMemorandum" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Auer: ''"Political Correctness"'', p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In political rhetoric===

The [[political right]] use the term more often in order to discrediting political opposites. By downgrading "left" ideals to "do-goodism", they emphasise the claim to argue in an own realistic way and on a factual level while the ''Gutmensch'' are implied to have lost touch with reality, to have a weak [[Human self-reflection|reflecting capacity]], an unrealistic and high claim or [[Utopia|utopian ideas]].&lt;ref name="knobloch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Auer: ''"Political Correctness"''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Leesen: ''"Das sagt man nicht!"''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Klonovsky]], for example, chief executive at German news magazine ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'', accused:&lt;ref&gt;Michael Klonovsky: [http://www.focus.de/wissen/bildung/theologie/debatte-das-gott-wort-der-guten_aid_536776.html ''Das Gott-Wort der Guten.''] In: ''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'', 31, 2 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The ''Gutmensch'' finds the fact outrageous that there is an unproductive lower class, a benefit-scrounging scum, that there is [[plebs]]. Therefore, he declares everyone of being bad who points it out to someone. If it is, on top of everything, an economic migrant, the popular accusation of racism and xenophobia is coming very likely into practice in the same way as the user of the term settles far from social inner cities.}}

People who are offended in such a way see this as a rhetoric trick, which ridicules their striving for [[humanism]], [[solidarity]] and [[social equity]]. Seeing the counterpart as ''Gutmensch'' took the discussion to a personal (''[[argumentum ad hominem]]'' = "ad personam") and emotional level, in order to avoiding a discussion on a content level.&lt;ref name="knobloch" /&gt;

The term is often used as an aggressive defense strategy against criticism on personal positions. Potential criticism on (factual or putative) racist, [[Homophobia|homophobic]], anti-semitic (and increasing also anti-Islamic) or [[sexism|sexual]] violations taboos is debilitated by downgrading the person with those rhetoric strategies.&lt;ref name="knobloch" /&gt;

===Moralistic strategy===

In political discussions the usage of the term ''Gutmensch'' gains a moral polarized shape, which is convenient to decrease the respect of the political opponent and to discredit them. There are strategies in political rhetoric to discuss political topics either on a factual level or on a moral level. [[Social stigma|Stigmatizations]] of political opponents by using terms like "[[political correctness|pc]]" (political correctness) or ''Gutmensch'' moralize communications. Therefore, the position of the political opponent is discredited and he is forced to change position, if he doesn`t want to lose reputation. Especially obvious becomes the strategy, if there are actual or claimed [[taboos]]. The art of the rhetoric is working when terms like ''Gutmensch'' or "moralizing prig" bring the political opponent in discussions into situations where the reply is supposed to say "my opinion or the tabooed view". This rhetoric proves as effective, because only under difficult circumstances can factual matters be discussed analytically. [[Clemens Knobloch]] ([[Universität Siegen]]) refers to this relationship.

===As "ideological code"===

According to a discourse analytical survey, which was published by political scientist Katrin Auer in the [[Österreichische Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft|Österreichischen Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft]] (ÖZP), are especially topics placed by the political right under the [[cipher]] "pc" (the term coming up usually because of ''Gutmenschen'') of which the society was not able to talk openly without falling victim to the "terror of ''Gutmenschen''". ''Gutmenschen'' thereby revealed were often pictured club swinging, in this context talking about "moralizing prig", "racist prig", "fascist prig", "Auschwitz prig" or similar, so Auer. Therefore, a concept of the enemy and a concept of the taboo came up, in which in particular misogynist, racist and [[anti-Semitic]] comments appeared rebellious and taboo breaking, it was said in the article. The term ''Gutmensch'' functioned here as code in order to being able to talk and being understood in this paradigm without having to expose one's own attitude, Auer adds. A well-known example was to replace the word "Jew" by the term ''Gutmensch'' in anti-Semitic speeches. Parts of the audience which understood themselves not as anti-Semitic, were allowed to agree without hesitation, concludes Katrin Auer.&lt;ref&gt;Auer: [http://www.oezp.at/pdfs/2002-3-04.pdf ''Political Correctness.''], pp. 294, 300 (PDF; 103&amp;nbsp;kB).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further use ==

===Until 20th century===
''Gutmenschen'', then called bonhommes or boni homines, was a term used for members of the heretic movement in medieval times. They were also referred to as [[Catharism|Cathars]], but for themselves they used the name ''veri christiani'' (true Christians). Aside from the derogatory use, the French term ''bonhomme'' (good person) did carry a positive connotation at times, ascribing moral qualities just as the English term ''[[gentleman]]'' does. On the other hand, it was non other than [[Karl Marx]] who used ''bonhomme'' in a derisive manner. He polemically wrote about "Jacque le bonhomme", which was a disguise for mocking [[Max Stirner]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Engels: ''Marx-Engels-Werke.'' 3, pp. 121–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Harald Martenstein ===
German author and journalist [[Harald Martenstein]] developed his own definition of ''Gutmensch'' after repeatedly having dealt with the term ''[[wikt:shitstorm|shitstorm]]'' (in German exclusively referring to an [[internet meme]]) in his writings. In 2015, he proposed using ''Gutmensch'' to describe people who act aggressive and [[Self-righteousness|self-righteous]] when fighting for what they think is the ''good cause'', unmindfully considering themselves being excluded from any set of social rules. ''Gutmenschen'', in that sense, believe that it is ok to be offensive, humiliating and to even exert violence.&lt;ref name="smü"&gt;Harald Martenstein: {{cite web|title=Über die Sehnsucht nach moralischer Überlegenheit|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.zeit.de/zeit-magazin/2015/12/harald-martenstein-moral-gutmensch|format=|accessdate=2015-05-13|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}, ''Zeit-Magazin'', 6 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Not even having publicized his proposal, Martenstein already received heavy criticism. Among the critics was [[Die Welt]] journalist Matthias Heine, who accused Martenstein of tempting the wrong people to over-use the word by putting too much of an emphasis on the term, therefore turning ''Gutmensch'' into an unusable word for those being of sound mind.&lt;ref name=mh&gt;Matthias Heine: {{cite web|title=Wer Gutmensch sagt, verdient sich seinen Shitstorm|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=https://www.welt.de/kultur/article138678946/Wer-Gutmensch-sagt-verdient-sich-seinen-Shitstorm.html|accessdate=2015-05-13|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}, ''[[Die Welt]]'', 23 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, one year earlier, German writer [[Akif Pirinçci]] had called Martenstein a ''Gutmensch'' in his [[polemic]] ''Deutschland von Sinnen'' (Germany unhinged).&lt;ref name="kas"&gt;Harald Martenstein: {{cite web|title=Über Kritik von allen Seiten|trans-title=|periodical=|publisher=|url=http://www.zeit.de/zeit-magazin/2014/21/harald-martenstein-kritik|format=|accessdate=2015-05-13|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}} ''Zeit-Magazin'', 17 May 2014; Akif Pirinçci: ''Deutschland von Sinnen. Der irre Kult um Frauen, Homosexuelle und Zuwanderer.'' Manuscriptum, Waltrop 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-944872-04-9}}, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Martenstein was still rather in favor of the term, polemically explaining in his book ''Die neuen Leiden des alten M.'' (The New Suffering of Old M.): "As for good-doing and most things in general, it is a question of the dosage: when overdone it becomes totalitarian."&lt;ref name="nlam"&gt;Harald Martenstein: ''Die neuen Leiden des alten M. Unartige Beobachtungen zum deutschen Alltag.'' Bertelsmann Verlag, München 2014, {{ISBN|978-3-641-15077-8}}, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wordmark ''Gutmensch'' ==
In 2014, Patrick Orth, manager of German rock band [[Die Toten Hosen]], registered the [[wordmark]] ''Gutmensch''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/tote-hosen-sichern-sich-rechte-am-unwort-gutmensch-a-1072085.html Deutungshoheit: "Tote Hosen" sichern sich Rechte am Unwort "Gutmensch"], spiegel.de&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the band has been selling print T-shirts labeled "Gutmensch – No one likes us. We don't care!". 10 Euros per T-shirt are donated to an organisation helping migrant crime victims.

==''Unwort des Jahres''==

Germany annually nominates a populist word that has a bad connotation. It is called "[[Un-word of the year|Unwort des Jahres]]" (in German the prefix Un- can be added to certain nouns, denoting undesirability and depreciating the original meaning). The jury consists of four German linguists and one journalist, who are independent and change every year.

''Gutmensch'' was nominated in 2011 (second position) and 2015 (first position).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sprachkritik: ''Gutmensch'' ist Unwort des Jahres|trans-title=|periodical=Spiegel Online|publisher=|url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/gutmensch-ist-unwort-des-jahres-2015-a-1071545.html|accessdate=2016-01-12|last=|date=2016-01-12|year=|month=|day=|language=German|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011 the jury stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;By using the term the ethical idea of the good man is picked up maliciously in internet forums in order to vilify all dissidents without considering their arguments. The term "Wutbürger" (enraged people) is used in a similar way, although the term ''Gutmensch'' violates principles of democracy (...). The term has been used in that way for already 20 years. However, it has gained more influence in different socio-political contexts in 2011 and has therefore increased its potential of vilifying dissidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwortdesjahres.net/fileadmin/unwort/download/pressemitteilung_unwort2011_01.pdf "Pressemitteilung: Unwort des Jahres 2011"], 17 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The statement in 2015 said that the term is connected to the refugee crisis. Here, especially those are insulted who voluntarily help refugees or stand against refugee asylums attacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unwortdesjahres.net/fileadmin/unwort/download/pressemitteilung_unwort2011_01.pdf Pressemitteilung der Jury]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wahl des 25.

The term ''Gutmensch'' was selected because "readiness to help others" vilified everyone who helped as naive, stupid and unworldly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/kultur/-gutmensch-ist-unwort-des-jahres-1.2814403 ''"Gutmensch" ist Unwort des Jahres 2015.''] ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', 12 Januar 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism was not only against populists of the right, but also against journalists of important media channels who would use the term "Gutmensch".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeit.de/kultur/2016-01/unwort-des-jahres-2015-gutmensch ''Gutmensch ist Unwort des Jahres''], ''[[Die Zeit]]'', 12 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2917">The '''Harmonised monitoring scheme''' is a long term [[river]] [[water quality]] [[environmental monitoring|monitoring]] scheme in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.defra.gov.uk/evidence/statistics/environment/inlwater/iwhmsdb.htm DEFRA - Freshwater quality - Harmonised Monitoring Scheme] {{webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130402151656/http://archive.defra.gov.uk/evidence/statistics/environment/inlwater/iwhmsdb.htm |date=2013-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to refer to the long term [[data set]]s produced by the scheme.

==Establishment==

The scheme was established in 1974 by the [[Department of the Environment]] with much of the initial planning and implementation undertaken by the [[Water Research Centre]]. It involved the creation of a network of sites across the UK. Most sites were at the downstream [[freshwater]] limits of the larger rivers although some of the largest rivers also included additional locations below major tributary confluences. Before inclusion of any location in the survey, homogeneity testing was carried out to characterise quality variations laterally and vertically within the river section chosen. For each designated point a specific sampling location was identified based on the results of the homogeneity exercise. In addition laboratories who were to undertake the analysis of samples were identified and a comprehensive [[Analytical quality control|AQC]] exercise was conducted to ensure comparability of data derived from the monitoring programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/1979/AN/an9790400290 Analytical Quality Control in the Harmonised Monitoring Scheme ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The scheme was originally intended to operate for 10 years from 1974 to 1984 to provide date to the Department of the Environment to permit the identification of national trends in water quality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwi.defra.gov.uk/research/completed-research/reports/dwi0224.pdf Co-ordination of analytical control for DOE Harmonised monitoring scheme]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also intended to satisfy the acquirements of the EU decision on the exchange of monitoring data requirements.

==Operation==
The scheme is administered by the [[Environment Agency]] in [[England]], by [[Natural Resources Wales]] in [[Wales]] and by [[Scottish Environment Protection Agency|SEPA]] in [[Scotland]] and involves routine monitoring at 230 sites including 56 river systems in Scotland.

==Data==
The data produced by the scheme provides a continuous and consistent record of quality of rivers across the UK for more than 30 years and can be used to demonstrate changes in water quality over that period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sepa.org.uk/science_and_research/data_and_reports/water/scottish_river_water_quality.aspx SEPA -Scottish River water quality trends]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35247">'''Interpersonal emotion regulation''' is the process of changing the emotional experience of one's self or another person through social interaction. It encompasses both '''intrinsic emotion regulation''' (also known as [[emotional self-regulation]]), in which one attempts to alter their own feelings by recruiting social resources, as well as '''extrinsic emotion regulation''', in which one deliberately attempts to alter the trajectory of other people's feelings.

== History of concept ==
The concept of interpersonal emotion regulation stems from earlier research into [[emotional self-regulation]], which is the within-person process whereby people influence and change their own feelings.&lt;ref name="Gross2"&gt;Gross, J. J. (1998). The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review. Review of general psychology, 2, 271-299.&lt;/ref&gt;  The field of psychology has traditionally focused on ''intra''personal processes in which a person manages their own emotions individually outside of the social context&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barthel|first=Abigail L.|last2=Hay|first2=Aleena|last3=Doan|first3=Stacey N.|last4=Hofmann|first4=Stefan G.|date=2018-10-18|title=Interpersonal Emotion Regulation: A Review of Social and Developmental Components|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/bec.2018.19|journal=Behaviour Change|pages=1–14|doi=10.1017/bec.2018.19|issn=0813-4839}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, modern theories have expanded the concept of emotion regulation to include ''inter''personal processes, in which emotion is regulated with or through other people. Interpersonal models emphasize that humans are social creatures who rarely experience emotions in isolation, and instead more commonly share, express, and manage their emotions with the help of others.&lt;ref name=":04" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beckes|first=Lane|last2=Coan|first2=James A.|date=2011|title=Social Baseline Theory: The Role of Social Proximity in Emotion and Economy of Action|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00400.x|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|language=en|volume=5|issue=12|pages=976–988|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00400.x|issn=1751-9004|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zaki|first=Jamil|last2=Williams|first2=W.

G. &amp; Doan, S. N. (2018). "The social foundations of emotion: Developmental, cultural, and clinical dimensions". Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. {{ISBN|978-1433829277}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concept ==

=== Intrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation ===
Intrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation involves managing one's own emotions through social interaction&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;, such as seeking [[social support]] or [[reassurance]] from others. Examples include calling a friend for advice, venting to a partner about a stressful situation, or engaging in conversation as a distraction from distress. In addition to regulating negative emotions, people also seek to amplify positive emotions by sharing good news with others. As with intrapersonal emotion regulation, people typically attempt to use interpersonal emotion regulation improve their affective state by decreasing negative emotions or increase positive emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsai|first=Jeanne L.|date=2007|title=Ideal Affect: Cultural Causes and Behavioral Consequences|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fjournals.sagepub.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1111%2Fj.1745-6916.2007.00043.x|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=3|pages=242–259|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2007.00043.x|issn=1745-6916|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Extrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation ===
Extrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation refers to the deliberate influence of others' [[emotion|feelings]].&lt;ref name="Niven"&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., &amp; Holman, D. (2009). A classification of controlled interpersonal affect regulation strategies. Emotion, 9, 498-509.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the many ways how social factors influence an individual's emotions&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, S. G. &amp; Doan, S. N. (2018). "The social foundations of emotion: Developmental, cultural, and clinical dimensions". Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. {{ISBN|978-1433829277}}.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Examples include trying to cheer up a friend who is upset, trying to make one's partner feel guilty for neglecting oneself, or trying to calm a stressed coworker. These examples illustrate that interpersonal emotion regulation may be used to make others feel better or worse, although making others feel better appears to be far more common.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== In groups ===
Many instances of interpersonal emotion regulation, such as those described above, are dyadic; in other words, they involve one person trying to influence the feelings of another person. However, interpersonal emotion regulation can occur between larger social groups. For example, in the workplace a leader might try to influence the feelings of a whole group of followers to make them feel more enthusiastic and motivated.&lt;ref&gt;George, J. M. (2000). Emotions and leadership: The role of emotional intelligence. Human relations, 53, 1027-1055.&lt;/ref&gt; Or in support groups, the whole group might work together to influence the feelings of a member to make the member feel less anxious or depressed.&lt;ref&gt;Thoits, P. A. (1996). Managing the emotions of others. Symbolic Interaction, 19, 85-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpersonal emotion regulation is used in most of the important social relationships that we have. Within the fields of developmental and clinical [[psychology]], researchers have long-recognized that people try to influence others' emotions (e.g., mothers influence the feelings of their babies,&lt;ref&gt;Field, T. (1994). The effects of mothers' physical and emotional unavailability on emotion regulation. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 59, 208-227.&lt;/ref&gt; therapists try to alleviate the sadness of their clients&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, H. C., Barkham, M., Stiles, W. B., &amp; Goldfried, M. R. (2002). Patterns of client emotion in helpful sessions of cognitive-behavioral and psychodynamic-interpersonal therapy. Journal of counseling psychology, 49, 376-380.&lt;/ref&gt;). More recently, social and organizational psychologists have also documented the use of interpersonal emotion regulation within romantic and familial relationships&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Macdonald, I., &amp; Holman, D. (2012). You spin me right round: Cross-relationship variability in interpersonal emotion regulation. Frontiers in Psychology, 3, 394.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vangelisti, A. L., Daly, J. A., &amp; Rudnick, J. R. (1991). Making people feel guilty in conversations: Techniques and correlates. Human Communication Research, 18, 3-39.&lt;/ref&gt; and in a range of work settings (e.g., hospitals,&lt;ref&gt;Francis, L. E., Monahan, K., &amp; Berger, C. (1999). A laughing matter? The uses of humor in medical interactions. Motivation and Emotion, 23, 154-177.&lt;/ref&gt; law firms,&lt;ref&gt;Lively, K. J. (2000). Reciprocal emotion management: Working together to maintain stratification in private law firms. Work and Occupations, 27, 32-63.&lt;/ref&gt; debt collection agencies,&lt;ref name="Sutton"&gt;Sutton, R. I. (1991). Maintaining norms about expressed emotions: The case of bill collectors. Administrative Science Quarterly, 36, 245-268.&lt;/ref&gt; and prisons&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., &amp; Holman, D. (2007). Changing moods and influencing people: The use and effects of emotional influence behaviours at HMP Grendon. Prison Service Journal, 173, 39-45.&lt;/ref&gt;). Interpersonal emotion regulation may even be used towards complete strangers as a way of making social interactions run more smoothly.&lt;ref&gt;Cahill, S. E., &amp; Eggleston, R. (1994). Managing emotions in public: The case of wheelchair users. Social Psychology Quarterly, 57, 300-312.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Related processes ===

Interpersonal emotion regulation overlaps with [[social support]], which involves giving others emotional, informational, or practical support.&lt;ref&gt;House, J. S., &amp; Kahn, R. L. (1985). Measures and concepts of social support. In S. Cohen and S. L. Syme (Eds.), Social support and health (pp. 79-108). Orlando, FL: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Models of interpersonal emotion regulation specify social support within the framework of regulatory goals to improve the feelings of one's self (by seeking support) or another person (by providing support). Emotion regulation mechanisms of social support include attentional deployment (e.g. distraction away from negative thoughts and toward the conversation) and cognitive change (e.g. encouragement to "look on the bright side" or change one's negative interpretation of a given situation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marroquín|first=Brett|date=2011|title=Interpersonal emotion regulation as a mechanism of social support in depression|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2011.09.005|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1276–1290|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2011.09.005|issn=0272-7358|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpersonal emotion regulation also shares links with other processes by which people come to influence others' emotions, such as [[emotional contagion]], in which the emotions of one person are 'caught' by another person as a result of mere contact (e.g., if someone was having a terrible day, they might 'infect' their friends with their bad mood).&lt;ref&gt;Hatfield, E., Cacioppo, J. T., &amp; Rapson, R. L. (1993). Emotional contagion. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 2, 96-99.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the compulsion to tell other people about our emotional experiences (termed the [[social sharing of emotions]]) can also result in other people coming to feel what we feel.&lt;ref&gt;Rimé, B., Finkenauer, C., Luminet, O., Zech, E., &amp; Philippot, P. (1998). Social sharing of emotion: New evidence and new questions. European review of social psychology, 9, 145-189.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between these processes and interpersonal emotion regulation regards the [[Automatic and Controlled Processes (ACP)|level of processing]] involved. Interpersonal emotion regulation is a controlled process, whereby a person intentionally tries to change the way others feel. In contrast, emotional contagion is thought to be relatively [[automaticity|automatic]], engaged without conscious awareness, while social sharing is somewhat more conscious but typically lacks the intent to influence others' emotions.

Interpersonal emotion regulation relates to [[emotional labor]], the [[regulation of emotion]] as part of one's job role.&lt;ref&gt;Grandey, A. A. (2000). Emotion regulation in the workplace: A new way to conceptualize emotional labor. Journal of occupational health psychology, 5, 95-110.&lt;/ref&gt; In emotional labor, an employee (usually in a service or care role) is required to manage his or her emotions as part of the job (e.g., 'service with a smile'). Because employees can also be required to manage the emotions of their customers or clients as part of their job (e.g., debt collectors are required to elicit anxiety in relaxed debtors to encourage them to make a payment&lt;ref name="Sutton" /&gt;), interpersonal emotion regulation can be performed as a form of emotional labor.&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., Holman, D., &amp; Cameron, D. (2012). Emotional labor at the unit-level. In A. Grandey, J. Diefendorff, &amp; D. Rupp (Eds.), Emotional labor in the 21st century: Diverse perspectives on emotion regulation at work. Psychology Press/Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related process is interpersonal influence, which involves trying to change the attitudes and/or behaviors of other people.&lt;ref&gt;Kipnis, D., Schmidt, S. M., &amp; Wilkinson, I. (1980). Intraorganizational influence tactics: Exploration of getting one's way. Journal of Applied Psychology, 65, 440-452.&lt;/ref&gt; The key difference here is that interpersonal emotion regulation is primarily concerned with changing other people's feelings; any changes to attitudes or behaviors are secondary to the impact on emotion.

== Theories ==

=== Social Baseline Theory ===
Drawing from [[evolutionary psychology]], '''social baseline theory''' purports that humans have adapted to function in a social environment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coan, J., &amp; Maresh, E. L. (2013). Social baseline theory and the social regulation of emotion. In J. Gross (Ed.), Handbook of emotion regulation (2nd ed.). New York, NY: Guilford Press&lt;/ref&gt; The brain acts under the assumption that proximity to other people is the norm, or baseline condition. As opposed to social isolation, which is associated with stress and poor health, social proximity is associated with attenuated cardiovascular, hormonal, and neural responses to threat, as well as longevity and physical health. The presence of others is theorized to help individuals conserve effort and metabolic resources through the social regulation of emotion. For example, the [[dorsolateral prefrontal cortex]] is less active during the down-regulation of negative affect while the presence of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eisenberger|first=Naomi I.|last2=Taylor|first2=Shelley E.|last3=Gable|first3=Shelly L.|last4=Hilmert|first4=Clayton J.|last5=Lieberman|first5=Matthew D.|date=2007|title=Neural pathways link social support to attenuated neuroendocrine stress responses|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.01.038|journal=NeuroImage|volume=35|issue=4|pages=1601–1612|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.01.038|issn=1053-8119|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coan|first=James A.|last2=Schaefer|first2=Hillary S.|last3=Davidson|first3=Richard J.|date=2006|title=Lending a Hand|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01832.x|journal=Psychological Science|volume=17|issue=12|pages=1032–1039|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2006.01832.x|issn=0956-7976|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social proximity is hypothesized to confer emotion regulatory benefits through three mechanisms: 1) risk distribution, 2) load sharing, and 3) capitalization. Risk distribution lowers [[Vigilance (psychology)|vigilance]] towards threat because risks seem lower as group size increases. Load sharing involves the knowledge that close others can provide help and resources if needed. Finally, capitalization refers to the intensification of positive emotions when they are shared with others.

=== Map of Interpersonal Regulation ===
A prominent model proposed by Jamil Zaki and Craig Williams (2013) conceptualizes different classes of interpersonal emotion regulation along two orthogonal dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zaki|first=Jamil|last2=Williams|first2=W. Craig|date=2013|title=Interpersonal emotion regulation.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0033839|journal=Emotion|volume=13|issue=5|pages=803–810|doi=10.1037/a0033839|issn=1931-1516}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first, intrinsic ''vs'' extrinsic, refers to the target of regulatory efforts. Intrinsic regulation involves an attempt to change one's own emotions through social contact, while extrinsic regulation involves trying to change the emotions of another person or group of people. The second dimension, response-dependent vs. response-independent, refers to whether or not the regulatory efforts depend upon the behavior of other people. Processes that rely upon how others respond or behave are considered response-dependent, while strategies that do not depend upon others' behavior are classified as response-independent. This model yields four classes of interpersonal emotion regulation:

# Intrinsic response-dependent: An individual tries to change their own affect through interaction with another person, whose feedback impacts the regulatory attempt. [[Safety behaviors (anxiety)|Safety behaviors]] fall into this category. For example, to alleviate anxiety a child might seek comfort from his mother, who responds in a soothing manner. Some forms of [[Social sharing of emotions|social sharing]] can also be considered an intrinsic response-dependent strategy, insofar as the listener's feedback influences the speaker's affect. For instance, sharing good news can intensify one's positive affect, but only if the listener responds enthusiastically.
# Intrinsic response-independent: Processes in this category involve attempts to alter one's own emotional experience through social contact, but the regulatory success does not depend upon how others react or behave. Affect labeling, or putting feelings into words, can dampen the intensity of emotional experience&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Torre|first=Jared B.|last2=Lieberman|first2=Matthew D.|date=2018-03-20|title=Putting Feelings Into Words: Affect Labeling as Implicit Emotion Regulation|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1754073917742706|journal=Emotion Review|volume=10|issue=2|pages=116–124|doi=10.1177/1754073917742706|issn=1754-0739}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commonly occurs during communication in social contexts without necessarily relying on the response of others. For instance, describing one's emotions through a conversation may result in a more nuanced understanding of one's feelings that facilitates coping.
# Extrinsic response-dependent: A person acts with the goal of changing another person's emotion, whose feedback plays an important role in indicating the success of the regulatory attempt. Examples include [[prosocial behavior]] and related processes such as [[Empathy|empathic]] responding that endeavor to improve other people's affective state. Feedback from the recipient is needed to signal whether or not they were helped.
# Extrinsic response-independent: This classification includes attempts to change another person's affective experience that to not depend upon that person's feedback. For example, [[Warm-glow giving|warm glow]] giving may result in the achieved extrinsic goal of engaging in prosocial behavior without receiving cues from the recipient as to whether or not they benefitted.

== Strategies ==

There are potentially hundreds of strategies that people can use to influence others' feelings. A series of studies reported by Niven and colleagues generated almost 400 unique strategies that could be differentiated primarily according to whether they are used to improve or to worsen others' feelings.&lt;ref name="Niven" /&gt; Another key distinction is between strategies that engage a person in the specific situation that has caused the emotion (e.g., trying to get the person to see a situation in a different light) and those that divert attention away (e.g., joking with the person).

Research based on Niven and colleagues' classification has indicated that these distinct strategy types have different effects on the well-being of the people who use them and also on the people who they are used towards.&lt;ref&gt;Martínez-Íñigo, D., Poerio, G. L., &amp; Totterdell, P. (2013). The association between controlled interpersonal affect regulation and resource depletion. Applied Psychology: Health and Well-being.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., Holman, D., &amp; Headley, T. (2012). Does regulating others' feelings influence people's own affective well-being? Journal of Social Psychology, 152, 246-260.&lt;/ref&gt; They may even have different implications for the quality of the relationship between these two parties.&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Holman, D., &amp; Totterdell, P. (2012). How to win friendship and trust by influencing people: An investigation of interpersonal affect regulation and the quality of relationships. Human Relations, 65, 777-805.&lt;/ref&gt;

A different way of distinguishing interpersonal emotion regulation strategies is according to the stage of the emotion that they focus on. Inspired by James Gross's process model of emotion,&lt;ref name="Gross"&gt;Gross, J. J. (1998). The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review. Review of general psychology, 2, 271-299.&lt;/ref&gt; some researchers have suggested that there is a difference between strategies that try to change the underlying emotion someone is feeling and strategies that try to change the emotion that the person expresses outwardly.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, M. (2007). Building genuine trust through interpersonal emotion management: A threat regulation model of trust and collaboration across boundaries.

Customer‐Focused Emotion Management Strategies. Personnel Psychology, 66, 261-286.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In psychopathology ==
Patterns of interpersonal emotion dysregulation may contribute to the onset and maintenance of mental health disorders.

=== Anxiety disorders ===
[[Anxiety disorder|Anxiety disorders]] are perpetuated by avoidance of feared stimuli. [[Avoidance coping|Avoidance]] behaviors can include the presence of "safety people", who reduce the anxious individual's distress while [[Negative Reinforcement|negatively reinforcing]] the avoidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofmann|first=Stefan G.|date=2014-05-23|title=Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Model of Mood and Anxiety Disorders|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10608-014-9620-1|journal=Cognitive Therapy and Research|volume=38|issue=5|pages=483–492|doi=10.1007/s10608-014-9620-1|issn=0147-5916}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an individual with panic disorder may ask her partner to drive her to work, which alleviates her fear of having a panic attack while driving. This pattern may lead to reliance upon others and contribute to continued avoidance (e.g. of driving a car alone). Another interpersonal strategy used in anxiety disorders is reassurance seeking. For example, someone with [[Obsessive–compulsive disorder|obsessive compulsive disorder]] may rely upon a roommate to assure them that the doors have been locked, or an individual with [[generalized anxiety disorder]] may ask a romantic partner for reassurances of love.

=== Depression ===
Individuals with depression experience maladaptive interpersonal interactions, which contribute to their depressive symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hammen|first=Constance|date=2018-06-07|title=Stress Generation and Depression|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190681777.013.15|journal=Oxford Handbooks Online|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190681777.013.15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors include greater expressed negativity (e.g. criticism, blaming, demanding, and disengagement) toward romantic partners,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davila|first=Joanne|last2=Bradbury|first2=Thomas N.|last3=Cohan|first3=Catherine L.|last4=Tochluk|first4=Shelly|date=1997|title=Marital functioning and depressive symptoms: Evidence for a stress generation model.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0022-3514.73.4.849|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=73|issue=4|pages=849–861|doi=10.1037//0022-3514.73.4.849|issn=0022-3514}}&lt;/ref&gt; and negative feedback seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swann|first=William B.|last2=Wenzlaff|first2=Richard M.|last3=Krull|first3=Douglas S.|last4=Pelham|first4=Brett W.|date=1992|title=Allure of negative feedback: Self-verification strivings among depressed persons.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0021-843x.101.2.293|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=101|issue=2|pages=293–306|doi=10.1037//0021-843x.101.2.293|issn=0021-843X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive reassurance seeking is also a vulnerability factor for depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joiner|first=Thomas E.|last2=Metalsky|first2=Gerald I.|date=2001-09|title=Excessive Reassurance Seeking: Delineating a Risk Factor Involved in the Development of Depressive Symptoms|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9280.00369|journal=Psychological Science|language=en|volume=12|issue=5|pages=371–378|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00369|issn=0956-7976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osborne|first=David W.

Social interaction that diverts attention away from self-referential negative thinking and promotes cognitive reappraisal may help to alleviate depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marroquín|first=Brett|date=2011-12|title=Interpersonal emotion regulation as a mechanism of social support in depression|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpr.2011.09.005|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|volume=31|issue=8|pages=1276–1290|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2011.09.005|issn=0272-7358}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Borderline personality disorder ===
According to the [[Biosocial theory|biosocial model]],&lt;ref&gt;Linehan, M. M. (1993). Cognitive-behavioral treatment of borderline personality disorder. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; individuals with [[borderline personality disorder]] develop intense emotional expression in part because they have been reinforced throughout development. For instance, a teenager with heightened emotional sensitivity is not taken seriously by her family until she threatens a suicide attempt. If her family responds with attention to extreme emotional expressions, she will learn to continue to express emotions in this way. Venting is another interpersonal emotion regulation strategy that is associated with personality disorder symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vollrath|first=Margarete|last2=Alnæs|first2=Randolf|last3=Torgersen|first3=Svenn|date=1998|title=Coping Styles Predict Change in Personality Disorders*|url=https://guilfordjournals.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fguilfordjournals.com%2Fdoi%2F10.1521%2Fpedi.1998.12.3.198|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders|language=en-US|volume=12|issue=3|pages=198–209|doi=10.1521/pedi.1998.12.3.198|issn=0885-579X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dixon-Gordon|first=Katherine L.|last2=Haliczer|first2=Lauren A.|last3=Conkey|first3=Lindsey C.|last4=Whalen|first4=Diana J.|date=2018|title=Difficulties in Interpersonal Emotion Regulation: Initial Development and Validation of a Self-Report Measure|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10862-018-9647-9|journal=Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment|volume=40|issue=3|pages=528–549|doi=10.1007/s10862-018-9647-9|issn=0882-2689|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychotherapy ===
Certain types of psychotherapy target interpersonal factors to improve well-being. [[Dialectical behavior therapy|Dialectical behavioral therapy]], originally developed for individuals with [[borderline personality disorder]], teaches clients interpersonal effectiveness, which includes a variety of skills for communicating emotions in a clear and socially acceptable manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lynch|first=Thomas R.|last2=Trost|first2=William T.|last3=Salsman|first3=Nicholas|last4=Linehan|first4=Marsha M.|date=2007|title=Dialectical Behavior Therapy for Borderline Personality Disorder|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095229|journal=Annual Review of Clinical Psychology|volume=3|issue=1|pages=181–205|doi=10.1146/annurev.clinpsy.2.022305.095229|issn=1548-5943|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Assertiveness|Assertiveness training]] is a behavioral intervention that teaches verbal and non-verbal assertiveness skills to inhibit anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frank|first=Jerome D.|date=1958|title=Psychotherapy by Reciprocal Inhibition by Joseph Wolpe|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/pbm.1958.0006|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|volume=2|issue=1|pages=123–125|doi=10.1353/pbm.1958.0006|issn=1529-8795}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment measures ==

Several questionnaires have been developed to measure people's self-reported use of interpersonal emotion regulation, including the Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS),&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., Stride, C., &amp; Holman, D. (2011). Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS): The development and validation of a new individual difference measure.

=== Emotion Regulation of Others and Self ===
The Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS) questionnaire &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Niven, K., Totterdell, P., Stride, C., &amp; Holman, D. (2011). Emotion Regulation of Others and Self (EROS): The development and validation of a new individual difference measure. Current Psychology, 30, 53-73.&lt;/ref&gt; is a freely available measure that assess strategies used to improve or worsen either one's own or another person's emotions, yielding a two-by-two framework: 1) intrinsic affect-improving, 2) intrinsic affect-worsening, 3) extrinsic affect-improving, and 4) extrinsic affect-worsening. The ''intrinsic'' subscale measures [[emotion self-regulation]] using 10 items. The ''extrinsic'' subscale measures deliberate attempts to improve or worsen others' emotions using 9 items.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.erosresearch.org/index.php/resources/tools/&lt;/ref&gt; There is low item endorsement for the affect-worsening dimension, suggesting that people rarely make deliberate attempts to worsen their own or others' emotions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, extrinsic affect-worsening is associated with health-related impairments, suggesting detrimental effects of engaging in these strategies likely due to negative social repercussions. Additionally, the affect-improving factor is unrelated to current levels of affect, which may be attributed to the scale's [[Psychometrics|psychometric]] properties or to a discrepancy between current mood state and strategy use (e.g., reporting use of affect-improving strategies more often while in a negative mood state).

=== Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Questionnaire ===
The Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (IERQ)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hofmann, S. G., Carpenter, J. K., &amp; Curtiss, J. (2016). Interpersonal Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (IERQ): Scale development and psychometric characteristics. Cognitive Therapy and Research, 40, 341-356. doi: 0.1007/s10608-016-9756-2.&lt;/ref&gt; is a 20-item measure designed to assess how individuals regulate their own emotions through the use of others. The questionnaire was developed through [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] interviews with participants (e.g., "When you are feeling down, in what ways do you look to other people to help you feel better?"), whose responses were [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]] tested using exploratory and confirmatory [[factor analysis]] to derive 4 factors containing 5 items each. The 4 factors include Enhancing Positive Affect (seeking social interaction to enhance happiness), Perspective Taking (recruiting others to point out that other people are in a worse situation), Soothing (seeking comfort and sympathy from others), and Social Modeling (observing others for examples of how to cope).

=== Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire ===
The Interpersonal Regulation Questionnaire (IRQ)&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=W. Craig|last2=Morelli|first2=Sylvia A.|last3=Ong|first3=Desmond C.|last4=Zaki|first4=Jamil|date=2018|title=Interpersonal emotion regulation: Implications for affiliation, perceived support, relationships, and well-being.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/pspi0000132|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=115|issue=2|pages=224–254|doi=10.1037/pspi0000132|issn=1939-1315|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 16-item measure of intrinsic interpersonal emotion regulation that assesses individuals' ''tendency'' to recruit social resources in response to emotional events, as well as their perceived [[Self-efficacy|''efficacy'']] of how effective interpersonal strategies are in improving their emotional experiences. Because it is a less common for individuals to deliberately worsen their mood,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elliot|first=Andrew J.|last2=Thrash|first2=Todd M.|date=2002|title=Approach-avoidance motivation in personality: Approach and avoidance temperaments and goals.|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.82.5.804|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|language=en|volume=82|issue=5|pages=804–818|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.82.5.804|issn=1939-1315}}&lt;/ref&gt; the measure focuses on increasing positive emotions and decreasing negative emotions. High interpersonal emotion regulation tendency and efficacy is related to greater emotional expressivity, empathy, social connectedness, and supportive relationships.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Individuals who score high on efficacy are more likely to benefit from social support.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Difficulties in Interpersonal Regulation of Emotion ===
The Difficulties in Interpersonal Regulation of Emotion (DIRE)&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; is a self-report measure of maladaptive interpersonal emotion regulation strategies that may relate to [[psychopathology]]. Respondents rate how likely they would be to use a variety of strategies in response to three vignettes about stressful hypothetical scenarios (task-oriented, romantic, social). The DIRS consists of four factors, including two intrapersonal (Accept, Avoid) and two interpersonal (Reassurance-seek, Vent) classes of strategies. Reassurance-seeking is related to overall emotion dysregulation, as well as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]] symptoms. Both reassurance-seeking and venting are associated with negative affect, interpersonal problems, stress, and [[borderline personality disorder]] symptoms.

== Focus Areas ==
Kaplavriksh has five major focus areas where it works upon.

===Alternatives===
It refers to initiatives proposed in consent with different stakeholders such as civil society organizations, government, individuals, communities etc. The initiatives carry features such as Ecological sustainability, Social well-being and justice, Direct Democracy, Economic Democracy etc.

===Conservation &amp; Livelihoods===
This program has its traces from institutes earliest initiatives since the early 1980s. It deals with activities such as field documentation, legal and policy analysis, biodiversity campaigns, [[Protected areas of India|protected area]] update etc.

===Environment Education===
It aims at sustainable use and conservation of natural resources by raising awareness with education to incorporate social equity and ecological sustainability. The goal is to make children sensitive about environment issues besides raising awareness and to develop and implement, decentralized (local) materials and programs for the conservation of the environment.

===Urban Environment===
Its focus is on care and protection of standing trees in urban areas such as river front, public gardens, ridge forests etc. It also monitors several urban development activities that may prove detrimental to trees such as road widening, construction of flyovers, footpath design etc. The institute is also working in collaboration with the [[Government of Delhi|Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi]] to provide for tree authority and tree helpline for a better implementation.

===Economic &amp; Development===
The institute investigates research on environment regulatory regimes that concerns individual's environment and livelihood. They comprises issues related to coastal regulations, forest clearance for projects etc. [[Right to Information Act, 2005]] usage remain central to this focus area.

Research into the many possible relationships, intersections and tensions between language and gender is diverse. It crosses disciplinary boundaries, and, as a bare minimum, could be said to encompass work notionally housed within [[applied linguistics]], [[linguistic anthropology]], conversation analysis, cultural studies, feminist media studies, feminist psychology, gender studies, interactional sociolinguistics, linguistics, [[mediated stylistics]], [[sociolinguistics]] and media studies. In methodological terms, there is no single approach that could be said to 'hold the field'. Discursive, poststructural, ethnomethodological, ethnographic, phenomenological, positivist and experimental approaches can all be seen in action during the study of language and gender, producing and reproducing what [[Susan Speer]] has described as 'different, and often competing, theoretical and political assumptions about the way discourse, ideology and gender identity should be conceived and understood'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Speer | first = Susan | author-link = Susan Speer | chapter = Introduction: feminism, discourse and conversation analysis | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mp4oaHvYz74C&amp;pg=PA7 | editor-last1 = Speer | editor-first1 = Susan A. | editor-link1 = Susan Speer | title = Gender talk: feminism, discourse and conversation analysis | pages = 7–8 | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 2005 | isbn = 9780415246446 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, research in this area can perhaps most usefully be divided into three main areas of study: first, there is a broad and sustained interest in the varieties of speech associated with a particular [[gender]]; second, there is a related interested in the social norms and conventions that (re)produce gendered language use&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tannen | first = Deborah |chapter= Language and culture | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dlzthEZGkmsC&amp;pg=PA350 | editor-last1 = Fasold | editor-first1 = Ralph W. | editor-last2 = Connor-Linton | editor-first2 = Jeff | title = An introduction to language and linguistics | pages = 343&amp;ndash;372 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780521612357 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (a [[Variety (linguistics)|variety of speech]] (or [[sociolect]]) associated with a particular gender is sometimes called a '''genderlect'''); and third, there are studies that focus on the contextually specific and locally situated ways in which gender is constructed and operationalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Attenborough | first = Frederick | author-link = Frederick T.

Prominent scholars include [[Deborah Tannen]], [[Penelope Eckert]], [[Janet Holmes (linguist)|Janet Holmes]], [[Mary Bucholtz]], [[Kira Hall]], [[Deborah Cameron (linguist)|Deborah Cameron]], and others. The 1995 edited volume ''Gender Articulated: Language and the Socially Constructed Self''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Hall | editor-first1 = Kira | editor-last2 = Bucholtz | editor-first2 = Mary | editor-link2 = Mary Bucholtz | title = Gender articulated: language and the socially constructed self | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1995 | isbn = 9781136045424 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is often referred to as a central text on language and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Holmes | editor-first1 = Janet | editor-last2 = Meyerhoff | editor-first2 = Miriam | editor-link1 = Janet Holmes | title = The handbook of language and gender | publisher = Blackwell Pub | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780631225027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 [[Robin Lakoff]] identified a "women's register", which she argued served to maintain women's (inferior) role in society.&lt;ref name="Lakoff, R. 1975"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lakoff | first = Robin | title = Language and woman's place: text and commentaries | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 2004 | origyear = 1975 | isbn = 9780195167573 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lakoff argued that women tend to use linguistic forms that reflect and reinforce a subordinate role. These include [[tag question]]s, [[High rising terminal|question intonation]], and "weak" [[Speech act#Classifying illocutionary speech acts|directives]], among others (see also [[#Speech practices associated with gender|Speech practices associated with gender]], below).&lt;ref name=Wolfram&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Wolfram | editor-first1 = Walt | editor-last2 = Schilling-Estes | editor-first2 = Natalie | title = American English: dialects and variation | publisher = Blackwell Pub. | location = Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2006 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9781405112666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies such as Lakoff's have been labeled the "deficit approach", since they posit that one gender is deficient in terms of the other. Descriptions of women's speech as deficient can actually be dated as far back as [[Otto Jespersen|Otto Jespersen's]] "The Woman", a chapter in his 1922 book ''Language: Its Nature and Development, and Origin.''&lt;ref name="Jespersen"&gt;{{cite book | last = Jespersen | first = Otto | author-link = Otto Jespersen | chapter = The woman | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=6jtXmwEACAAJ | title = Language: its nature, development, and origin | publisher = Hamlin Press | location = | origyear = 1922 | year = 2013 | isbn = 9781473302310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jespersen's idea that women's speech is deficient relative to a male norm went largely unchallenged until Lakoff's work appeared fifty years later.&lt;ref name=Wolfram/&gt;  Nevertheless, despite the political incorrectness of the chapter's language from a modern perspective, Jespersen's contributions remain relevant.  These include the prospect of language change based on social and gendered opportunity, lexical and phonological differences, and the idea of genderlects and gender roles influence language.

Not long after the publication of ''Language and Woman's Place'', other scholars began to produce studies that both challenged Lakoff's arguments and expanded the field of language and gender studies.&lt;ref name=Bucholtz/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wolfram/&gt; One refinement of the deficit argument is the so-called "dominance approach", which posits that gender differences in language reflect power differences in society.&lt;ref name="OBarr"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = O'Barr | first1 = William | last2 = Atkins | first2 = Bowman | chapter = 'Women's language' or 'powerless language' | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KpM_AAAAMAAJ | editor-last1 = Borker | editor-first1 = Ruth | editor-last2 = Furman | editor-first2 = Nelly | editor-last3 = MacConnel-Ginet | editor-first3 = Sally | title = Women and language in literature and society | pages = 93&amp;ndash;110 | publisher = Praeger | location = New York | year = 1980 | isbn = 9780030578939 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jennifer Coates outlines the historical range of approaches to gendered speech in her book ''Women, Men and Language''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Coates | first = Jennifer | title = Women, men and language: a sociolinguistic account of gender differences in language | publisher = Routledge | location = Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon New York, NY | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZU1ACwAAQBAJ  | year = 2016 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9781317292531 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She contrasts the four approaches known as the deficit, dominance, difference, and dynamic approaches.

''Deficit'' is an approach attributed to Jespersen that defines adult male language as the standard, and women's language as deficient.&lt;ref name="Jespersen" /&gt;  This approach created a dichotomy between women's language and men's language.  This triggered criticism to the approach in that highlighting issues in women's language by using men's as a benchmark.  As such, women's language was considered to have something inherently 'wrong' with it.

''Dominance'' is an approach whereby the female sex is seen as the subordinate group whose difference in style of speech results from male supremacy and also possibly an effect of patriarchy. This results in a primarily male-centered language. Scholars such as Dale Spender&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Spender | first = Dale | title = Man made language | publisher = New York University Press | location = London New York New York | year = 1998 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780863584015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Don Zimmerman and Candace West&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | chapter = Small insults: a study of interruptions in conversations between unacquainted persons | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xiliAAAAMAAJ | editor-last1 = Thorne | editor-first1 = Barrie | editor-last2 = Kramarae | editor-first2 = Cheris | editor-last3 = Main Henley | editor-first3 = Nancy | title = Language, gender, and society | pages = 102&amp;ndash;117 | publisher = Newbury House | location = Rowley, Massachusetts | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780883772683 }}&lt;/ref&gt; subscribe to this view.

''Difference'' is an approach of equality, differentiating men and women as belonging to different 'sub-cultures' as they have been socialised to do so since childhood. This then results in the varying communicative styles of men and women. Deborah Tannen is a major advocate of this position.&lt;ref name=YJDU&gt;{{cite book | last = Tannen | first = Deborah | title = You just don't understand: women and men in conversation | publisher = Morrow | location = New York, NY | year = 1990 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=evwRw4SkF8MC | isbn = 9780060959623 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tannen compares gender differences in language to cultural differences. Comparing conversational goals, she argues that men tend to use a "report style", aiming to communicate factual information, whereas women more often use a "rapport style", which is more concerned with building and maintaining relationships.&lt;ref name=YJDU /&gt;

The "dynamic" or "[[social constructionist]]" approach is, as Coates describes, the most current approach to language and gender.  Instead of speech falling into a natural gendered category, the dynamic nature and multiple factors of an interaction help a socially appropriate gendered construct.  As such, West and Zimmerman describe these constructs as "[[doing gender]]" instead of the speech itself necessarily being classified in a particular category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = West | first1 = Candace | last2 = Zimmerman | first2 = Don H. | title = Doing gender | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 125&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243287001002002 | jstor = 189945 | date = June 1987 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0891243287001002002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://campus.fsu.edu/bbcswebdav/institution/academic/social_sciences/sociology/Reading%20Lists/Social%20Psych%20Prelim%20Readings/IV.%20Structures%20and%20Inequalities/1987%20West%20Zimmerman%20-%20Doing%20Gender.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; This is to say that these social constructs, while affiliated with particular genders, can be utilized by speakers as they see fit.

Scholars including Tannen and others argue that differences are pervasive across media, including face-to-face conversation,&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fitzpatrick | first1 = Mary Anne | last2 = Mulac | first2 = Anthony | last3 = Dindia | first3 = Kathryn | title = Gender-preferential language use in spouse and stranger interaction | journal = [[Journal of Language and Social Psychology]] | volume = 14 | issue = 1&amp;ndash;2 | pages = 18&amp;ndash;39 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0261927x95141002 | date = March 1995 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0261927x95141002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HannahMurachver&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hannah | first1 = Annette | last2 = Murachver | first2 = Tamar | title = Gender and conversational style as predictors of conversational behavior | journal = [[Journal of Language and Social Psychology]] | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 153&amp;ndash;174 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0261927x99018002002 | date = June 1999 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0261927x99018002002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; written essays of primary school children,&lt;ref name="Mulac"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mulac | first1 = Anthony | last2 = Studley | first2 = Lisa B.  | last3 = Blau | first3 = Sheridan | title = The gender-linked language effect in primary and secondary students' impromptu essays | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 23 | issue = 9&amp;ndash;10 | pages = 439&amp;ndash;470 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/bf00289762 | date = November 1990 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00289762 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; email,&lt;ref name="Thomson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson | first1 = Rob | last2 = Murachver | first2 = Tamar | title = Predicting gender from electronic discourse | journal = [[British Journal of Social Psychology]] | volume = 40 | issue = 2 | pages = 193&amp;ndash;208 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1348/014466601164812 | date = June 2001 | url = https://doi.org/10.1348/014466601164812 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even toilet graffiti.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Green | first = James A. | title = The writing on the stall: gender and graffiti | journal = [[Journal of Language and Social Psychology]] | volume = 22 | issue = 3 | pages = 282&amp;ndash;296 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0261927X03255380 | date = September 2003 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0261927X03255380 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deborah Cameron, among other scholars, argues that there are problems with both the dominance and the difference approach. Cameron notes that throughout the history of scholarship on language and gender male-associated forms have been seen as the [[Markedness|unmarked norm]] from which the female deviates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | author-link = Deborah Cameron (linguist) | title = Verbal hygiene | publisher = Routledge | location = Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 9786613954404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the norm 'manager' becomes the marked form 'manageress' when referring to a female counterpart. On the other hand, Cameron argues that what the difference approach labels as different ways of using or understanding language are actually displays of differential power. Cameron suggests, "It is comforting to be told that nobody needs to 'feel awful': that there are no real conflicts, only misunderstandings. ... But the research evidence does not support the claims made by Tannen and others about the nature, the causes, and the prevalence of male-female miscommunication."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | author-link = Deborah Cameron (linguist) | title = The myth of Mars and Venus: do men and women really speak different languages | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780199214471 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that social differences between men's and women's roles are not clearly reflected in language use. One additional example is a study she has done on call center operators in the UK, where these operators are trained to be scripted in what they say and to perform the necessary '[[emotional labor]]' (smiling, expressive intonation, showing rapport/empathy and giving minimal responses) for their customer-callers. This emotional labor is commonly associated with the feminine domain, and the call center service workers are also typically females. However, the male workers in this call center do not orient to the covertly gendered meanings when they are tasked to perform this emotional labor. While this does not mean that the 'woman's language' is revalued, nor does this necessarily call for a feminist celebration, Cameron highlights that it is possible that with time, more men may work in this service industry, and this may lead to a subsequent "de-gendering" of this linguistic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Cameron | first = Deborah | author-link = Deborah Cameron (linguist) | title = Styling the worker: gender and the commodification of language in the globalized service economy | journal = [[Journal of Sociolinguistics]] | volume = 4 | issue = 3 | pages = 323&amp;ndash;347 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-9481.00119 | date = August 2000 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9481.00119 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/podzim2010/GEN144/um/CAMERON_Styling_the_Worker.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication styles are always a product of context, and as such, gender differences tend to be most pronounced in single-gender groups. One explanation for this, is that people [[Communication Accommodation Theory|accommodate]] their language towards the style of the person they are interacting with. Thus, in a mixed-gender group, gender differences tend to be less pronounced. A similarly important observation is that this accommodation is usually towards the language style, not the gender of the person. That is, a polite and empathic male will tend to be accommodated to on the basis of their being polite and empathic, rather than their being male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thomson | first1 = Rob | last2 = Murachver | first2 = Tamar | last3 = Green | first3 = James | title = Where Is the gender in gendered language?  | journal = [[Psychological Science]] | volume = 12 | issue = 2 | pages = 171&amp;ndash;175 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1111/1467-9280.00329 | date = March 2001 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/1467-9280.00329 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Ochs argues that gender can be indexed directly and indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ochs | first = Elinor | chapter = Indexing gender | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Jh59S6WIS98C&amp;pg=PA338 | editor-last1 = Duranti | editor-first1 = Alessandro | editor-last2 = Goodwin | editor-first2 = Charles | title = Rethinking context : language as an interactive phenomenon | pages = 335&amp;ndash;357 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge England New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780521422888 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct indexicality is the primary relationship between linguistics resources (such as lexicon, morphology, syntax, phonology, dialect and language) and gender. For example, the pronouns "he" and "she" directly indexes "male" and "female". However, there can be a secondary relationship between linguistic resources and gender where the linguistic resources can index certain acts, activities or stances which then indirectly index gender. In other words, these linguistic resources help constitute gender. Examples include the Japanese particles "wa" and "ze". The former directly index delicate intensity, which then indirectly indexes the female "voice" while the latter directly indexes coarse intensity, which then indirectly indexes the male "voice".

Women are generally believed to speak a better "language" than men do. This is a constant misconception, but scholars believe that no gender speaks a better language, but that each gender instead speaks its own unique language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Azizi | first = Masoud | chapter = Language and gender: Do women speak a better language? | chapterurl = https://www.academia.edu/4007491/Azizi_M._2011_._Language_and_gender_Do_women_speak_a_better_language_In_A._Shafaei_Ed._Frontiers_of_Language_and_Teaching_Vol._2_Proceedings_of_the_2011_International_Online_Language_Conference_pp._90-93_._Boca_Raton_Universal-Publishers | editor-last = Shafaei | editor-first = A. | title = Frontiers of language and teaching (Vol. 2): Proceedings of the 2011 International Online Language Conference (IOLC 2011) | pages = 90&amp;ndash;93 | publisher = Universal Publishers, BrownWalker Press | location = Boca Raton, Florida | year = 2011 | oclc = 794001605}}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion has sparked further research into the study of the differences between the way men and women communicate.

=== Children's television ===
A specific area of study within the field of language and gender is the way in which it affects [[Children's television series|''children's television'']]. Mulac et al.'s "''Male/Female Language Differences and Attributional Consequences in Children's Television''" focuses on identifying differing speech patterns of male versus female characters in popular children's television programs at the time (the 1980s).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mulac | first1 = Anthony | last2 = Bradac | first2 = James J. | last3 = Karol Mann | first3 = Susan | title = Male/female language differences and attributional consequences in children's television | journal = [[Human Communication Research]] | volume = 11 | issue = 4 | pages = 481&amp;ndash;506 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2958.1985.tb00057.x | date = June 1985 | url = https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2958.1985.tb00057.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data gathered by Mulac et al. comes from a two-week period in 1982 from three [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] daytime programs and three categories from [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial network programs]] (action, comedy/adventure, and commercials) that aired on Saturdays. They analyzed randomly selected interactive dialogue taken once from every ten minutes of their tapes. Mulac et al. collected data for 37 language variables, from which they determined the thirteen that showed significant differences between usage by male and female characters. Mulac et al.'s definitions of these thirteen features are as follows:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The following tended to be higher in frequency for males: vocalized pauses, action verbs, present tense verbs, justifiers, subordinating conjunctions, and grammatical "errors". On the other hand, the following were found to occur more for females: total verbs, uncertainty verbs, adverbials beginning sentences, judgmental adjectives, concrete nouns, and polite forms. In addition, female characters had longer sentences on average.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another facet of Mulac et al.'s research was to gather participants' subjective ratings on characters' socio-intellectual status (high/low social status, white/blue collar, literate/illiterate, rich/poor), dynamism (aggressive/unaggressive, strong/weak, loud/soft, active/passive), and aesthetic quality (pleasing/displeasing, sweet/sour, nice/awful, beautiful/ugly), based on the transcripts from the shows' dialogue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Aubrey's 2004 study "''The Gender-Role Content of Children's Favorite Television Programs and Its Links to Their Gender-Related Perceptions''" identifies gender stereotypes in children’s television programs and evaluates the effects of these stereotypes on children’s personal [[Gender role|gender-role]] values and interpersonal attraction.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Aubrey | first1 = Jennifer Stevens | last2 = Harrison | first2 = Kristen | title = The gender-role content of children's favorite television programs and its links to their gender-related perceptions | journal = Media Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = 2 | pages = 111&amp;ndash;146 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1207/s1532785xmep0602_1 | date = 2004 | url = https://doi.org/10.1207/s1532785xmep0602_1 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aubrey chose shows for the study based on children’s responses when asked to name their favorite television program (the top-named show was [[Rugrats]], followed by [[Doug (TV series)|Doug]]). Some of the stereotypes found in the study pertain to language/communication, but most are stereotypes or attributes of the characters such as assertiveness, aggression, emotionality, and cattiness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In regards to language, the study found that male characters were more likely to ask questions, assert opinions, and direct others than female characters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Female characters, on the other hand, were more likely to "receive or make comments about body or beauty" than their male counterparts.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In general, Aubrey found less stereotypical content for female characters than for male, which they recognize to be a possible effect of either the higher presence of male characters or the difficulty of measuring [[Passivity (behavior)|passivity]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Speech practices associated with gender ==
Not all members of a particular sex may follow the specific gender roles that are prescribed by society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tannen | first = Deborah | title = Gender and discourse | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780195101249 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The patterns in gender and communication that follow are only the norms for each gender, and not every member of the corresponding sex may fit into those patterns.

===Minimal responses===
One of the ways in which the communicative behaviors of men and women differ is in their use of minimal responses, i.e., [[paralinguistic]] features such as 'mm' and 'yeah', which is behaviour associated with collaborative language use.&lt;ref name="Carli"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Carli | first = Linda L. | title = Gender, language, and influence | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 59 | issue = 5 | pages = 941&amp;ndash;951 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association|APA]] via [[PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.59.5.941 | date = November 1990 | url = https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.59.5.941 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men generally use them less frequently than women, and when they do, it is usually to show agreement, as Don Zimmerman and Candace West's study of [[turn-taking]] in conversation indicates.&lt;ref name="ZimmWest"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Zimmerman | first1 = Don H. | last2 = West | first2 = Candace | chapter = Sex roles, interruptions and silences in conversation | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VgjUyTDftkwC | editor-last1 = Thorne | editor-first1 = Barrie | editor-last2 = West | editor-first2 = Candace | title = Language and sex: difference and dominance | pages = 105&amp;ndash;129 | publisher = Newbury House Publishers | location = Rowley, Massachusetts | year = 1975 | isbn = 9780883770436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the above can be true in some contexts and situations, studies that dichotomize the communicative behavior of men and women may run the risk of over-generalization. For example, "minimal responses appearing "throughout streams of talk", such as "mm" or "yeah", may only function to display active listening and interest and are not always signs of "support work", as Fishman claims. They can—as more detailed analysis of minimal responses show—signal understanding, demonstrate agreement, indicate scepticism or a critical attitude, demand clarification or show surprise.&lt;ref name="Fishman, Pamela 1978"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fishman | first = Pamela | title = Interaction: The work women do | journal = [[Social Problems]] | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 387&amp;ndash;400 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | doi = 10.2307/800091 | jstor = 800091 | date = February 1977 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/800091 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, both male and female participants in a conversation can employ these minimal responses for interactive functions, rather than gender-specific functions.

===Questions===
Men and women differ in their use of questions in conversations. For men, a question is usually a genuine request for information whereas with women it can often be a rhetorical means of engaging the other's conversational contribution or of acquiring attention from others conversationally involved, techniques associated with a collaborative approach to language use.&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Barnes | first = Douglas | title = Language and learning in the classroom | journal = Journal of Curriculum Studies | volume = 3 | issue = 1 | pages = 27&amp;ndash;38 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/0022027710030104  | date = 1971 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/0022027710030104  | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, women use questions more frequently.&lt;ref name="Fitzpatrick" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Todd"&gt;{{cite book | last = Todd | first = Alexandra Dundas | chapter = A diagnosis of doctor-patient discourse in the prescription of contraception | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Qt4oBnGYmNcC&amp;pg=PA183 | editor-last1 = Fisher | editor-first1 = Sue | editor-last2 = Todd | editor-first2 = Alexandra Dundas | title = The social organization of doctor-patient communication | pages = 183&amp;ndash;212 | publisher = Ablex Pub. Corp | location = Norwood, New Jersey | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780893916992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study carried out by Alice Freed and Alice Greenwood in 1996 showed that there was no significant difference in the use of questions between genders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freed | first1 = Alice F. | last2 = Greenwood | first2 = Alice | title = Women, men, and type of talk: What makes the difference? | journal = [[Language in Society]] | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;26 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | doi = 10.1017/S0047404500020418 | date = March 1996 | url = https://doi.org/10.1017/S0047404500020418 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In writing, however, both genders use rhetorical questions as literary devices. For example, Mark Twain used them in "[[The War Prayer]]" to provoke the reader to question his actions and beliefs. Tag questions are frequently used to verify or confirm information, though in women's language they may also be used to avoid making strong statements.&lt;ref name="Lakoff, R. 1975"/&gt;

===Turn-taking===
As the work of Victoria DeFrancisco shows, female linguistic behaviour characteristically encompasses a desire to take turns in conversation with others, which is opposed to men's tendency towards centering on their own point or remaining silent when presented with such implicit offers of conversational turn-taking as are provided by [[hedge (linguistics)|hedge]]s such as "y' know" and "isn't it".&lt;ref name="DeFrancisco"&gt;{{cite journal | last = DeFrancisco | first = Victoria Leto | title = The sounds of silence: how men silence women in marital relations | journal = [[Discourse &amp; Society]] | volume = 2 | issue = 4 | pages = 413&amp;ndash;423 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0957926591002004003 | date = October 1991 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/0957926591002004003 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This desire for turn-taking gives rise to complex forms of interaction in relation to the more regimented form of turn-taking commonly exhibited by men.&lt;ref name="SSJ"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sacks | first1 = Harvey | last2 = Schegloff | first2 = Emanuel A. | last3 = Jefferson | first3 = Gail | title = A simple systematics for the organization of turn-taking for conversation | journal = [[Language (journal)|Language]] | volume = 50 | issue = 4 (part 1) | pages = 696&amp;ndash;735 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | doi = 10.1353/lan.1974.0010 | jstor = 412243 | date = December 1974 | url = https://doi.org/10.1353/lan.1974.0010 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing the topic of conversation===
According to Bruce Dorval in his study of same-sex friend interaction, males tend to change subject more frequently than females.&lt;ref name="Dorval"&gt;{{cite book | editor-last = Dorval | editor-first = Bruce | title = Conversational organization and its development | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ZYsoAAAAYAAJ | volume = Volume XXXVIII | publisher = Ablex | location = Norwood, New Jersey | year = 1990 | series = Advances in Discourse Processes | isbn = 9780893916633 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This difference may well be at the root of the conception that women chatter and talk too much. Goodwin observes that girls and women link their utterances to previous speakers and develop each other's topics, rather than introducing new topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Goodwin | first = Majorie Harness | title = He-said-she-said: talk as social organization among Black children | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ESDkGWmjNiIC | publisher = Indiana University Press | location = Bloomington | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780253206183 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a study of young American couples and their interactions reveal that while women raise twice as many topics as men, it is the men's topics that are usually taken up and subsequently elaborated in the conversation.&lt;ref name="Fishman, Pamela 1978"/&gt;

===Self-disclosure===
{{Refimprove section |date=November 2011}}
Female tendencies toward [[self-disclosure]], i.e., sharing their problems and experiences with others, often to offer sympathy,&lt;ref name="Dindia"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dindia | first1 = Kathryn | last2 = Allen | first2 = Mike | title = Sex differences in disclosure: A meta-analysis | journal = [[Psychological Bulletin]] | volume = 112 | issue = 1 | pages = 106&amp;ndash;124 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association|APA]] via [[PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.106 | date = July 1992 | url = https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.112.1.106 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrasts with male tendencies to non-self disclosure and professing advice or offering a solution when confronted with another's problems.&lt;ref name=YJDU/&gt;

Self-disclosure is not simply providing information to another person. Instead, scholars define self-disclosure as sharing information with others that they would not normally know or discover. Self-disclosure involves risk and vulnerability on the part of the person sharing the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Borchers |first=Tim |title=Interpersonal communication: self-disclosure | publisher = Allyn &amp; Bacon |year=1999 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120720092451/http://www.abacon.com/commstudies/interpersonal/indisclosure.html | archive-date = 20 July 2012 |url=http://www.abacon.com/commstudies/interpersonal/indisclosure.html |accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it comes to genderlect, self-disclosure is important because genderlect is defined as the differences in male and female communication. Men and women have completely different views of self-disclosure.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} Developing a close relationship with another person requires a certain level of intimacy, or self-disclosure. It typically is much easier to get to know a woman than it is to get to know a man.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} It has been proven{{By whom|date=September 2013}} that women get to know someone on a more personal level and they are more likely to desire to share their feelings.

It has also been said{{By whom|date=September 2013}} that people share more via technology. The phenomenon is known as [[Computer-mediated communication|Computer Mediated Communication]], also known as CMC.  This form of communication typically involves text only messages that tend to lose their nonverbal cues.  Men and women are both more likely to self-disclose on the computer than they would be face to face.  People are more confident when using Computer Mediated Communication because communication is faceless, which makes it easier to divulge information.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Research has been conducted to examine whether self-disclosure in adult friendship differs according to gender and marital status. Sixty-seven women and fifty-three men were asked about intimate and non-intimate self-disclosure to closest same-sex friends. Disclosure to spouse among married respondents was also assessed. The intimate disclosure of married men to friends was lower than that of unmarried men, married women and unmarried women; the intimate disclosure of these last three groups was similar. Married people's non-intimate disclosure to friends was lower than that of unmarried people, regardless of gender. Married people's intimate disclosure to their spouses was high regardless of gender; in comparison, married men's intimate disclosure to their friends was low, while married women's disclosure to their friends was moderate or even as high as disclosure to their spouses. The results suggest that sex roles are not the only determinant of gender differences in disclosure to friends. Marital status appears to have an important influence on disclosure in friendship for men but not for women. It was concluded that research on gender differences in self-disclosure and friendship has neglected an important variable, that of marital status."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Derlega | first1 = Valerian J. | last2 = Metts | first2 = Sandra | last3 = Petronio | first3 = Sandra  | last4 = Margulis | first4 = Stephen T.  | title = Self-disclosure | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Newbury Park | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=j7m6QgAACAAJ | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780803939554 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This research goes to show that when a man is married he is less likely to have intimate self-disclosure. This could be because a man may feel he is betraying his wife's confidence by disclosing information that might be considered private. However, the research also showed that the married women didn't change much in either situation, because women tend to self disclose more than men.

Men tend to communicate differently with other men than they do with other women, while women tend to communicate the same with both men and women. "Male and female American students who differed in masculinity and in femininity self-disclosed to a same-sex stranger in contexts that made either social/expressive motives or instrumental motives salient. The results were consistent with the primary assertion that measures of sex role identity are better predictors of contextual variations in self-disclosure than is sex per se. Sex consistently failed to predict subjects' willingness to self-disclose, both within and across contexts, whereas femininity promoted self-disclosure in the context that was clearly social and expressive in character. Although masculinity failed to exert the expected facilitative impact on self-disclosure within the instrumental context, it nonetheless influenced the results; androgynous subjects, who scored high in both masculinity and femininity, were more self-revealing across contexts than was any other group."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ashida | first1 = Sato | last2 = Koehly | first2 = Laura M. | last3 = Roberts | first3 = J.

Displaying strictly feminine or masculine traits will not be to one's advantage in communication, because it is important to be able to recognize and utilize these traits to be an effective communicator.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

From a social skills perspective, gender, tunic, and cultural differences in relationships may stem, in part, from differences in communication. The influence of biological sex on communication values has received scholarly attention. In general, women value affectively oriented communication skills more than men, and men value instrumentally oriented communication skills more than women, although the effect size for these differences are generally small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Anuradha | first = M. | title = Gender stereotyping in television commercials aimed at children in India | journal = Media Asia | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 209&amp;ndash;215 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/01296612.2012.11689939 | date = 2012 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/01296612.2012.11689939 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-disclosure is also very important when it comes to a close dating relationship between men and women. Successful communication in relationships is one of the greatest difficulties most couples are forced to overcome. Men in relationships with women may practice self-disclosure more often than their female partner. Self-disclosure is considered to be a key factor in facilitating intimacy. For example, American heterosexual couples were studied using various measures twice a year. By using the average scores of both partners, they found that self-disclosure was higher in those couples who remained together at the second administration of the surveys than in those who broke up between two administrations. Similarly, researchers asked heterosexual couples who had just begun dating to complete a self-disclosure measure and to answer the same questionnaire four months later. They found that couples who were still dating four months later reported greater self-disclosure at the initial contact than did those who later broke up. This test shows self-disclosure can be beneficial to facilitating a positive relationship. Self-disclosure is a process which typically begins rapidly, but then plateaus as the couple gains more information.  The initial self-disclosure is extremely important when first meeting someone. The first interactions between a potential couple could be deciding factors in the success or failure of the relationship.

Self-disclosure is difficult because not all women and men communicate the same.

===Verbal aggression===
Aggression can be defined by its three intersecting counterparts: indirect, relational and social. Indirect aggression occurs when the victim is attacked through covert and concealed attempts to cause social suffering. Examples are gossiping, exclusion or ignoring of the victim. Relational aggression, while similar to indirect, is more resolute in its attentions. It can be a threat to terminate a friendship or spreading false rumors. The third type of aggression, social aggression, "is directed toward damaging another's self-esteem, social status, or both, and may take direct forms such as verbal rejection, negative facial expressions or body movements, or more indirect forms such as slanderous rumors or social exclusion."&lt;ref name="Blake, J. J. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blake | first1 = Jamilia J. | last2 = Kim | first2 = Eun Sook | last3 = Lease | first3 = A.

Dr. M.K. Underwood, leading researcher in child clinical psychology and developmental psychology, began using the term social aggression in several of her experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Underwood | first = M.K. | title = Speech {{!}} Keynote Speaker | url = http://www.collin.edu/conference/studentresearch/keynote.html | publisher = Collin College Interdisciplinary Undergraduate Student Research Conference  | date = 2011 | access-date = 1 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, Underwood followed 250 third-graders and their families in order to understand how anger is communicated in relationships, especially in face-to-face and behind-the-back situations. It was found that technology and electronic communication has become a key factor in social aggression. This discovery has been termed [[cyber-bullying]]. In another experiment, social aggression was used to see if verbal and nonverbal behaviors contributed to a person's social value.&lt;ref name="Blake, J. J. 2011"/&gt; It was found that those who communicated nonverbal signals were seen as angry and annoyed by their peers. In a third study, the experimenters determined that while socially aggressive students were vastly disliked, they were alleged to be the popular kids and had the highest marked social status. Most research has been based on teacher assessments, case studies and surveys.

For years, all research on aggression focused primarily on males because it was believed females were non-confrontational. Recently however, people have realized that while "boys tend to be more overtly and physically aggressive, girls are more indirectly, socially, and relationally aggressive."&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; In a study done measuring cartoon character's aggressive acts on television, these statistics were found:&lt;ref name="Luther, C. A. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Luther | first1 = Catherine A. | last2 = Legg Jr. | first2 = J. Robert | title = Gender differences in depictions of social and physical aggression in children's television cartoons in the US | journal = Journal of Children &amp; Media | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 191&amp;ndash;205 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/17482791003629651 | date = 2010 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/17482791003629651 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 76.9% of physical aggression was committed by male characters
* 23.1% of physical aggression was committed by female characters
* 37.2% of social aggression was committed by male characters
* 62.8% of social aggression was committed by female characters

Physical and social aggression emerge at different points in life. Physical aggression occurs in a person's second year and continues till preschool. Toddlers use this aggression to obtain something they want that is otherwise denied or another has. In preschool, children become more socially aggressive and this progresses through adolescence and adulthood. Social aggression is not used to acquire materialistic things but to accomplish social goals.&lt;ref name="Rosen, L. H. 2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = Lisa H. | last2 = Underwood | first2 = Marion K. | last3 = Beron | first3 = Kurt J. | title = Peer victimization as a mediator of the relation between facial attractiveness and internalizing problems | journal = Merrill-Palmer Quarterly | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | pages = 319&amp;ndash;347 | publisher = [[Wayne State University Press]] | jstor = 23098049 | doi = 10.1353/mpq.2011.0016 | date = July 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1353/mpq.2011.0016 | ref = harv | postscript = .| pmc = 3186210 }} [https://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/mpq/vol57/iss3/6/ Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in first grade, research has shown that young females are more disliked when they are socially aggressive than when young males are physically aggressive. However, until the fourth grade there is an overall negative correlation between aggression and popularity.&lt;ref name="Garandeau"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garandeau | first1 = Claire F. | last2 = Ahn | first2 = Hai-Jeong | last3 = Rodkin | first3 = Philip C. | title = The social status of aggressive students across contexts: The role of classroom status hierarchy, academicachievement, and grade | journal = [[Developmental Psychology (journal)|Developmental Psychology]] | volume = 47 | issue = 6 | pages = 1699&amp;ndash;1710 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association|APA]] via [[PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/a0025271 | date = November 2011 | url = https://doi.org/10.1037/a0025271 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of fifth grade, aggressive children, both male and female, are more popular than their non-aggressive counterparts.  This popularity does not insinuate likeability.

In the seventh grade, social aggression seems to be at its peak. When eight-, eleven- and fifteen-year-olds were compared, there were high reports of social aggression but no apparent statistical differences between the age groups.&lt;ref name="Rosen, L. H. 2011"/&gt;

Several studies have shown that social aggression and high academic performance are incompatible. In classrooms with a high achievement record, researchers were less likely to find social aggression. Vice versa can be found for classrooms with a low achievement record.&lt;ref name="Garandeau" /&gt;

In adolescence, social aggression boosts female's popularity by maintaining and controlling the social hierarchy. Furthermore, males are also ranked higher in popularity if they are physically aggressive. But, if males practice relational or social aggression then they are seen as unpopular among their peers.&lt;ref name="Blake, J. J. 2011"/&gt; When it comes to different forms social aggression, males are more prone to use direct measures and females indirect.

In addition to gender, the conditions in which a child grows up in also affects the likelihood of aggression.&lt;ref name="Rosen, L. H. 2011"/&gt; Children raised in a divorced, never married or low-income family are more likely to show social aggression. This is speculated because of the higher rates of conflict and fighting already in the household. Parents who use an aversive style of parenting can also contribute to the social aggression in their children.&lt;ref name="Rosen, L. H. 2011"/&gt; Researchers venture that "perhaps children who are treated harshly by parents have a higher baseline level of anger…and may lack the opportunities to practice more direct, assertive strategies for conflict resolution so may be prone to maligning others or lashing out when they are angry."&lt;ref name="Rosen, L. H. 2011"/&gt;

Through the last couple decades, the media has increased its influence over America's youth. In a study done measuring the aggressive acts committed by cartoon characters on television, out of 8927 minutes of programming time 7856 aggressive acts took place. This is roughly .88 aggressive acts per minute.&lt;ref name="Luther, C. A. 2010"/&gt; Because television and cartoons are one of the main mediums for entertainment, these statistics can be troubling. If children relate to the characters, then they are more likely to commit similar acts of aggression. For teenagers, popular films and series such as ''[[Mean Girls]]'' (2004), ''[[Easy A]]'' (2010) and ''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]]'' (2007) have shown an exaggerated, damaging view of how society works. Already, latest studies have shown an increase of social aggression in girls. Other experiments, such as one done by  [[Albert Bandura]], the [[Bobo doll experiment]], have shown similar results of society shaping your behavior because of the impact of a model.

The development of social aggression can be explained by the social identity theory and evolutionary perspective.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt;

The social identity theory categorizes people into two groups, in-groups and out-groups. You see yourself as part of the in-group and people who are dissimilar to you as part of the out-group. In middle and high school these groups are known as cliques and can have several names. In the popular 2004 teen drama ''Mean Girls'', "varsity jocks", "desperate wannabes", "over-sexed band geeks", "girls who eat their feelings", "cool Asians" and "the Plastics" were several cliques from the movie.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; Two common middle and high school cliques seen in everyday life are the popular crowd, in-group, and everyone else, out-group. The out-group has several other divisions but for the most part the in-group will categorize the out-groups all as one.

Around this time, it becomes important for a females social identity to be associated with the in-group. When a girl possess qualities that are valued in the in-group, then her social identity will increase. However, if her characteristics resemble those of the out-group, then she will be attack the out-group in order to keep her social standing within the in-group. This intergroup struggle, also known as social competition, mostly comes the in-group condemning the out-group, not the other way around.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt;

Moreover, social aggression can lead to intragroup competition. Inside the social groups there is also a hierarchal ranking, there are followers and there are leaders. When one's position in the group does not lead to positive self-identity, then the group members will feud with one another to increase status and power within the clique. Studies show that the closer a female is to her attacker, the less likely she is to forgive.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt;

Where the social identity theory explains direct social aggression, research done in the evolutionary perspective explains indirect social aggression. This aggression stemmed from "successful competition for scarce resources… and enables optimal growth and development."&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; Two tactics used are the coercive and prosocial strategies. The coercive strategies involve controlling and regulating all resources of the out-group through a monopoly. For this scheme, one must rely heavily on threats and aggression. The other strategy, prosocial, involves helping and sharing resources. This method shows complete dominance for the in-group, because in order for others to survive they must subordinate themselves to receive resources. Ability to control resources effectively results in higher-ranking in the in-group, popular crowd.

Social aggression can be detrimental for both ends of the spectrum, the out-group and in-group members. Longitudinal studies prove that aggression can lead to victims feeling lonely and socially isolated. In addition, targets report feeling depressed and affected by other health risks such as headaches, sleepiness, abdominal pain and bedwetting.&lt;ref name="Luther, C. A. 2010"/&gt; The aggressors on the other hand, were suggested to "encounter future problems in social relationships or emotional difficulties during early childhood."&lt;ref name="Luther, C. A. 2010"/&gt; In academics, victims were reported to having below average test scores and low achievement.

Studies that measure cross-gender differences show that females find social aggression to be more hurtful than males do. The results of the hurt and pain felt by female victims can be seen in all ages.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; Pre-school teachers have reported several cases of female students feeling depressed. In high school, the female victims begin to slowly isolate themselves. A year later, this seclusion has led to social phobia. Furthermore, in college, pressure and aggression from Greek life has lowered life satisfaction and increased antisocial behavior in several female students.

While social aggression has several downfalls, it has also led to a mature social competence of males and females. Being part of an in-group can increase a person's self-worth and contribute to his or her personal identity. In terms of the evolutionary perspective, being able to control definite and indefinite resources can increase a person's social competence.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; Some research argues that reports of social aggression and bullying can teach students in school what is considered unacceptable behavior. In a 1998 survey, 60% of students found that bullying "makes kids tougher."&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; However, there is additional need for support on this claim.

Since 1992, there have been nine school intervention and prevention programs, which have met the rigorous criteria of efficacy, to avert social aggression.&lt;ref name="Leff, S. R. 2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leff | first1 = Stephen S. | last2 = Waasdorp | first2 = Tracy Evian | last3 = Crick | first3 = Nicki R. | title = A review of existing relational aggression programs: strengths, limitations, and future directions | journal = [[School Psychology Review]] | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 508&amp;ndash;535 | publisher = [[National Association of School Psychologists|NASP]] | pmc = 3111222 | date = 2010 | url = http://www.nasponline.org/publications/periodicals/spr/volume-39/volume-39-issue-4/a-review-of-existing-relational-aggression-programs-strengths-limitations-and-future-directions | ref = harv | postscript = . | pmid=21666876}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programs include Early Childhood Friendship Project (2009), You Can't Say You Can't Play (1992), I Can Problem Solve (2008), Walk Away, Ignore, Talk, Seek Help (2003), Making Choices: Social Problem Skills for Children (2005), Friend to Friend (2009), Second Step (2002), Social Aggression Prevention Program (2006), Sisters of Nia (2004).

When designing a prevention program, it is important to remember to keep the program age and gender appropriate.&lt;ref name="Leff, S. R. 2010"/&gt; For example, Early Childhood Friendship Project and You Can't Say You Can't Play have visual activities for the preschoolers and integrate puppet shows into the lesson plan. In addition, because males and females approach aggression differently there must be personalized plans to fit both genders.

However, intervention programs even with the best intentions can be harmful.&lt;ref name="Cupach, William R. 2011"/&gt; For one, the progress of the intervention can be short lived. Studies have measured the effectiveness of intervention programs three separate times during the course of one year and no improvements were shown. Secondly, because social aggression is said to increase social identity and belonging to a group, many students have tried to disrupt the programs. A third implication is that the interventions need to study how adverse behaviors develop. Otherwise the solution might not fit the problem. Lastly, the programs must be designed to fit the needs of girls and boys and not the ones of the researchers. If the intervention program is designed to give insight for research rather than reducing and bettering aggression, then it can be detrimental to society.

Although a few forms of behavior may be sex-specific, in general they reflect patterns of power and control between the sexes, which are found in all human groups, regardless of sex composition. These modes of behaviors are perhaps more appropriately labeled 'powerlects' instead of 'genderlects'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lamb | first = Theodore A. | title = Nonverbal and paraverbal control in Dyads and Triads: sex or power differences? | journal = [[Social Psychology Quarterly]] | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages = 49&amp;ndash;53 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.2307/3033863 | date = March 1981 | url = https://doi.org/10.2307/3033863 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Listening and attentiveness===
In a conversation, meaning does not reside in the words spoken, but it filled in by the person listening.  Each person decides if they think others are speaking in the spirit of differing status or symmetrical connection. The likelihood that individuals will tend to interpret someone else's words as one or the other depends more on the hearer's own focus, concerns, and habits than on the spirit in which the words were intended.&lt;ref name=YJDU /&gt;

It appears that women attach more weight than men to the importance of [[Empathy|listening]] in conversation, with its connotations of power to the listener as confidant of the speaker. This attachment of import by women to listening is inferred by women's normally lower rate of interruption &amp;mdash; i.e., disrupting the flow of conversation with a topic unrelated to the previous one&lt;ref name="PFishman"&gt;{{cite news | last = Fishman | first = Pamela | title = Interactional shitwork | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170321032801/http://heresiesfilmproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/heresies2.pdf | archive-date = 21 March 2017 | url = http://heresiesfilmproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/heresies2.pdf | work = [[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics]], special issue: Patterns of Communication and Space Among Women | pages = 99&amp;ndash;101 | date = May 1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; and by their largely increased use of minimal responses in relation to men.&lt;ref name="ZimmWest"/&gt; Men, however, interrupt far more frequently with non-related topics, especially in the mixed sex setting and, far from rendering a female speaker's responses minimal, are apt to greet her conversational spotlights with silence, as the work of Victoria DeFrancisco demonstrates.&lt;ref name="DeFrancisco"/&gt;

When men talk, women listen and agree.  However men tend to misinterpret this agreement, which was intended in a spirit of connection, as a reflection of status and power.  A man might conclude that a woman is indecisive or insecure as a result of her listening and attempts of acknowledgment.  When in all actuality, a woman's reasons for behaving this way have nothing to do with her attitudes toward her knowledge, but are a result of her attitudes toward her relationships. The act of giving information frames the speaker with a higher status, while the act of listening frames the listener as lower.  However, when women listen to men, they are not necessarily thinking in terms of status, but in terms of connection and support.&lt;ref name=YJDU /&gt;

===Marriages===

Individual roles are gendered by social interaction, the media, and language. There are certain stereotypes society places on the way men and women communicate. Women are often believed to talk too much while men talk too little. Men are stereotyped to be more of a public speaker and leader, while women are stereotyped to talk more in private among their family and friends. For women, society views their use of communication as a way to express feelings and emotions. For men, society views their use of communication as a way to express power and negotiate status among other individuals.&lt;ref name=YJDU /&gt; There are also certain societal stereotypes about how men and women communicate within a heterosexual marriage or relationship. When a man and a women are communicating within their relationship, the traditional language roles are altered. The man becomes more passive and the woman becomes more active. A man's stereotypical silent communication style is often disappointing for women, while a woman's emotionally articulate communication style is often seen as aggravating for a man.&lt;ref name=YJDU /&gt; This creates the assumption that women and men have opposing communication styles, therefore creating society's cliche that men and women don't understand each other. This leads to many inter-relational quarrels because of one individual blaming the other for communicating inefficiently due to using the communication style that society has constructed according to their biological sex.&lt;ref name=YJDU /&gt;{{Failed verification|talk=I just don't understand|date=May 2016}}

===Dominance versus subjection===
This, in turn, suggests a dichotomy between a male desire for conversational dominance – noted by Helena Leet-Pellegrini with reference to male experts speaking more verbosely than their female counterparts – and a female aspiration to group conversational participation.&lt;ref name="Leet"&gt;{{cite book | last = Leet-Pellegrini | first = Helena M. | chapter = Conversational dominance as a function of gender and expertise | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8w1iAAAAMAAJ | editor-last1 = Giles | editor-first1 = Howard | editor-last2 = Robinson | editor-first2 = W. Peters | editor-last3 = Smith | editor-first3 = Philip M. | title = Language: social psychological perspectives: selected papers from the first International Conference on Social Psychology and Language held at the University of Bristol, England, July 1979 | pages = 97&amp;ndash;104 | publisher = Pergamon Press | location = Oxford New York | year = 1980 | isbn = 9780080246963 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One corollary of this is, according to Jennifer Coates, that males are afforded more attention in the context of the classroom and that this can lead to their gaining more attention in scientific and technical subjects, which in turn can lead to their achieving better success in those areas, ultimately leading to their having more power in a technocratic society.&lt;ref name="Coates93"&gt;{{cite book | last = Coates | first = Jennifer | title = Women, men and language : a sociolinguistic account of gender differences in language | publisher = Routledge | location = Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon New York, NY | year = 2016 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9781315645612 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversation is not the only area where power is an important aspect of the male/female dynamic. Power is reflected in every aspect of communication from what the actual topic of the communication, to the ways in which it is communicated.  Women are typically less concerned with power more concerned with forming and maintaining relationships, whereas men are more concerned with their status. Girls and women feel it is crucial that they be liked by their peers, a form of involvement that focuses on symmetrical connection.  Boys and men feel it is crucial that they be respected by their peers, as form of involvement that focuses on asymmetrical status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tannen | first = Deborah | title = I only say this because I love you | publisher = Virago | location = London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781860499814 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences in priorities are reflected in the ways in which men and women communicate.  A woman's communication will tend to be more focused on building and maintaining relationships.  Men on the other hand, will place a higher priority on power, their communication styles will reflect their desire to maintain their status in the relationship.

According to Tannen's research, men tend to tell stories as another way to maintain their status.  Primarily, men tell jokes, or stories that focus on themselves.  Women on the other hand, are less concerned with their own power, and therefore their stories revolve not around themselves, but around others. By putting themselves on the same level as those around them, women attempt to downplay their part in their own stories, which strengthens their connections to those around them.

===Politeness===
Lakoff identified three forms of politeness: formal, deference, and camaraderie. Women's language is characterized by formal and deference politeness, whereas men's language is exemplified by camaraderie.&lt;ref name="Lakoff, R. 1975"/&gt;

Politeness in speech is described in terms of positive and negative face.&lt;ref name="Brown+Levinson"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Brown | first1 = Penelope |last2 = Levinson | first2 = Stephen | chapter = Universals in language usage: politeness phenomena | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YvFsAAAAIAAJ | editor-last = Goody | editor-first = Esther | title = Questions and politeness: strategies in social interaction | pages = 56&amp;ndash;289 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge New York | year = 1978 | isbn = 9780521292504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Positive face'' refers to one's desire to be liked and admired, while ''negative face'' refers to one's wish to remain autonomous and not to suffer imposition. Both forms, according to Penelope Brown's study of the Tzeltal language, are used more frequently by women whether in mixed or single-sex pairs, suggesting for Brown a greater sensitivity in women than have men to face the needs of others.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book | last = Brown | first = Penelope | chapter = How and why are women more polite: some evidence from a Mayan community | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=10NbPwAACAAJ | editor-last1 = McConnell-Ginet | editor-first1 = Sally | editor-last2 = Borker | editor-first2 = Ruth | editor-last3 = Furman | editor-first3 = Nelly | title = Women and language in literature and society | pages = 111&amp;ndash;136 | publisher = Praeger | location = New York | year = 1980 | isbn = 9780275905200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In short, women are to all intents and purposes largely more polite than men. However, negative face politeness can be potentially viewed as weak language because of its associated [[hedge (linguistics)|hedge]]s and tag questions, a view propounded by O'Barr and Atkins (1980) in their work on courtroom interaction.&lt;ref name="OBarr"/&gt;

==Gender-specific vocabulary==
Some natural languages have intricate systems of gender-specific [[vocabulary]].

* [[Irish Sign Language]], due to single sex Deaf schools, developed separate male and female vocabularies which can still be seen today.
*  It is speculated that [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] women had a special language called ''Emesal'', distinct from the main language, ''Emegir'', which was spoken by both genders. The women's language had a distinct vocabulary, found in the records of religious rituals to be performed by women, also in the speech of goddesses in mythological texts. There has been some dispute about the role of Emesal, with suggestions by some scholars that Emegir was a dialect used by the public and more informally while Emesal was a literary language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Whittaker | first = Gordon | chapter = Linguistic anthropology and the study of Emesal as (a) women's language | chapter-url = https://www.scribd.com/document/45691958/Whittaker-Linguistic-Anthropology-and-Emesal | editor-last1 = Parpola | editor-first1 = Simo | editor-last2 = Whiting | editor-first2 = Robert M. | title = Sex and gender in the ancient Near East: proceedings of the 47th Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale, Helsinki, July 2-6, 2001 | pages = 633&amp;ndash;644 | publisher = Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project | location = Helsinki | year = 2002 | isbn = 9789514590542 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* For a significant period of time in the history of the ancient [[languages of India]], after the formal language [[Sanskrit]] diverged from the popular [[Prakrit]] languages, some Sanskrit plays recorded the speech of women in Prakrit, distinct from the Sanskrit of male speakers.  This convention was also used for illiterate and low-caste male speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Halder | first = Shashwati | chapter = Prakrit |chapter-url = http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Prakrit | editor-last1 = Islam | editor-first1 = Sirajul | editor-last2 = Jamal | editor-first2 = Shashwati | title = Banglapedia: national encyclopedia of Bangladesh | publisher = [[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] | location = Dhaka | year = 2012 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9789845120364 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Garifuna language|Garifuna]] has a vocabulary split between terms used only by men and terms used only by women. This does not however affect the entire vocabulary but when it does, the terms used by men generally come from [[Cariban languages|Carib]] and those used by women come from [[Arawakan languages|Arawak]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
* The indigenous Australian language [[Yanyuwa language|Yanyuwa]] has separate dialects for men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kirton | first = Jean F. | chapter = Yanyuwa, a dying language | chapter-url = http://www.ethnologue.com/show_work.asp?id=21977 | editor-last = Ray | editor-first = Michael J. | title = Aboriginal language use in the Northern Territory: 5 reports: Work Papers of the Summer Institute of Linguistics | pages = 1&amp;ndash;18 | publisher = Summer Institute of Linguistics | location = Darwin | year =  1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Ancient Greek]], there is evidence for some difference between the speech of men and women, as evidenced for example in the comedies of [[Aristophanes]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
*In the [[Lakota language]], a small number of enclitics (approximately eight) differ in form based on the gender of the speaker. While many native speakers and linguists agree that certain enclitics are associated with particular genders, such usage may not be exclusive. That is, individual men sometimes use enclitics associated with women, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Trechter | first = Sarah | chapter =  Contextualizing the exotic few: gender dichotomies in Lakhota | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=O5rmCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101 | editor-last1 = Bucholtz | editor-first1 = Mary | editor-last2 = Liang | editor-first2 = A.C. | editor-last3 = Sutton | editor-first3 = Laurel A. | title = Reinventing identities: the gendered self in discourse | pages = 101&amp;ndash;122 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = New York London | year = 1999 | isbn = 0195126297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4800">A '''law''' is a [[universality (philosophy)|universal]] principle that describes the fundamental nature of something, the universal properties and the relationships between things, or a description that purports to explain these principles and relationships.

== "Laws of nature " ==

{{See|Physical law}}

For example, "physical laws" such as the "[[gravity|law of gravity]]" or "[[science|scientific laws]]" attempt to describe the fundamental nature of the universe itself. Laws of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]] describe the nature of rational thought and inference ([[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s [[transcendental idealism]], and differently [[G. Spencer-Brown]]'s work ''[[Laws of Form]]'', was precisely a determination of the ''[[A priori and a posteriori (philosophy)|a priori]]'' laws governing human thought before any interaction whatsoever with experience).

Within most fields of study, and in science in particular, the elevation of some principle of that field to the status of "law" usually takes place after a very long time during which the principle is used and tested and verified; though in some fields of study such laws are simply postulated as a foundation and assumed. Mathematical laws are somewhere in between: they are often arbitrary and unproven in themselves, but they are sometimes judged by how useful they are in making predictions about the real world. However, they ultimately rely on arbitrary [[axioms]].  

== "Laws of fundamentals in mathematics" ==

Some fundamental law of mathematics was introduced by '''Harsha
'''.                                                                 

'''First law of fundamentals:''' If we consider '''k''' as a constant and '''a, b &amp; c''' are any real numbers of which the product of '''a''' and '''b''' is '''c''' but the product of &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{k}&lt;/math&gt;and  &lt;math&gt;\frac{b}{k}&lt;/math&gt;is not equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{k}&lt;/math&gt;.    

'''Complemantry of first law of fundamentals:'''As per first law '''a, b &amp; c''' are any real numbers and '''k''' is any constant the product of '''a''' and '''b''' is '''c''',then the product of &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{b}{k}&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{k^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Second law of fundamentals:'''If we consider '''a, b &amp; c''' are any real numbers and '''k''' be any constant the division of '''a''' and '''b''' is '''c''' and the division of &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{b}{k}&lt;/math&gt; is not equal to &lt;math&gt;\frac{c}{k}&lt;/math&gt; but equal    
to '''c'''.

== "Laws" in social sciences ==

Laws of [[economics]] are an attempt in [[modelization]] of economic behavior. [[Marxism]] criticized the [[belief]] in eternal "laws of economics", which it considered a product of the [[ideology#Ideology as an instrument of social reproduction|dominant ideology]]. It claimed that in fact, those so-called "laws of economics" were only the historical laws of [[capitalism]], that is of a particular historical social formation. With the advent, in the 20th century, of the application of mathematical, statistical, and experimental techniques to economics, economic theory matured into a corpus of knowledge rooted in the scientific method rather than in philosophical argument.

==Miscellaneous==

Finally, the term is sometimes applied to less rigorous ideas that may be interesting observations or relationships, practical or ethical guidelines (also called [[rule of thumb|rules of thumb]]), and even humorous parodies of such laws.

Examples of scientific laws include [[Boyle's law]] of gases, [[conservation law]]s, [[Ohm's law]], and others. Laws of other fields of study include [[Occam's razor]] as a principle of [[philosophy]] and [[Say's law]] in [[economics]]. Examples of observed phenomena often described as laws include the [[Titius-Bode law]] of planetary positions, [[Zipf's law]] of linguistics, [[Thomas Malthus]]'s Principle of Population or [[Malthusian Growth Model]], [[Moore's law]] of technological growth. Other laws are pragmatic and observational, such as the [[Unintended consequences|law of unintended consequences]].

Some humorous parodies of such laws include [[adage]]s such as [[Murphy's law]] and its many variants, and [[Godwin's Law]] of [[Internet]] conversations.

'''Marine debris''', also known as '''marine litter''', is human-created [[waste]] that has deliberately or accidentally been released in a [[lake]], [[sea]], [[ocean]], or [[waterway]]. Floating oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of [[gyre]]s and on [[coast]]lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/TECH/science/9807/28/toxic.seabirds/|title=Pollution invades small Pacific island|author=Gary Strieker|date=28 July 1998|accessdate=1 April 2008|publisher=CNN|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231062708/http://www.cnn.com/TECH/science/9807/28/toxic.seabirds/|archivedate=31 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; frequently washing aground, when it is known as ''beach litter'' or tidewrack. Deliberate disposal of wastes at sea is called ''ocean dumping''. Naturally occurring debris, such as [[driftwood]], are also present.

With the increasing use of [[plastic]], human influence has become an issue as many types of plastics do not [[Biodegradation|biodegrade]]. Waterborne plastic poses a serious threat to [[fish]], [[seabird]]s, [[marine reptile]]s, and [[marine mammal]]s, as well as to boats and coasts.&lt;ref name="Facts22"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/marinedebris101|title=Facts about marine debris|publisher=US NOAA|accessdate=10 April 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213110801/http://marinedebris.noaa.gov/marinedebris101/|archivedate=13 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dumping, container spillages, litter washed into storm drains and waterways and wind-blown landfill waste all contribute to this problem.

In efforts to prevent and mediate marine debris and pollutants, laws and policies have been adopted internationally. Depending on relevance to the issues and various levels of contribution, some countries have introduced more specified protection policies.

8.8 million metric tons of plastic waste are dumped in the world's oceans each year.

[[Microplastics]] on the other hand harm smaller marine life. For example, [[pelagic]] plastic pieces in the center of our ocean’s gyres outnumber live marine plankton, and are passed up the food chain to reach all marine life.&lt;ref name="Moore et al, 2007"&gt;C.J.

===Deep-sea debris===
Litter, made from diverse materials that are denser than surface water (such as [[glass]]es, metals and some plastics), have been found to spread over the floor of seas and open oceans, where it can become entangled in [[coral]]s and interfere with other [[Benthos|sea-floor life]], or even become buried under sediment, making [[Marine salvage|clean-up]] extremely difficult, especially due to the wide area of its dispersal compared to [[shipwrecks]].

Over 40% of oceans are classified as subtropical gyres, a fourth of the planets surface area has become an accumulator of floating plastic debris.

Not all [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] artifacts placed in the oceans are harmful. Iron and concrete structures typically do little damage to the environment because they generally sink to the bottom and become immobile, and at shallow depths they can even provide scaffolding for [[artificial reef]]s. Ships and subway cars have been deliberately sunk for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://192.5.14.110/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1377/MR1377.ch5.pdf |work=Disposal Options for Ships |title=Chapter 5: Reefing |accessdate=3 May 2008 |date=2 August 2006 |author1=Ron Hess |author2=Denis Rushworth |author3=Michael Hynes |author4=John Peters |publisher=Rand Corporation |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629110318/http://192.5.14.110/pubs/monograph_reports/MR1377/MR1377.ch5.pdf |archivedate=29 June 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debris removal==
[[File:DC WASA Marine Debris Skimmer.jpg|thumb|Skimmer boat used to remove floating debris and trash from the [[Potomac River|Potomac]] and [[Anacostia River|Anacostia]] rivers]]

Techniques for collecting and removing marine (or riverine) debris include the use of debris skimmer boats ''(pictured)''. Devices such as these can be used where floating debris presents a danger to navigation. For example, the [[US Army Corps of Engineers]] removes 90 tons of "drifting material" from [[San Francisco Bay]] every month. The Corps has been doing this work since 1942, when a [[seaplane]] carrying Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]] collided with a piece of floating debris and sank, costing the life of its pilot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spn.usace.army.mil/newsrelease/newsrelease_11_07_07.html |title=Debris collection onsite after Bay Bridge struck |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |accessdate=7 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109084709/http://www.spn.usace.army.mil/newsrelease/newsrelease_11_07_07.html |archivedate=9 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once debris becomes "beach litter", collection by hand and specialized [[beach cleaner|beach-cleaning machines]] are used to gather the debris.

Elsewhere, "trash traps" are installed on small rivers to capture waterborne debris before it reaches the sea. For example, [[South Australia]]'s [[Adelaide]] operates a number of such traps, known as "trash racks" or "gross pollutant traps" on the [[Torrens River]], which flows (during the wet season) into [[Gulf St Vincent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amlrnrm.sa.gov.au/ProjectsTaskforce/TrashRacks/tabid/544/Default.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719020149/http://www.amlrnrm.sa.gov.au/ProjectsTaskforce/TrashRacks/tabid/544/Default.aspx|dead-url=yes|archivedate=19 July 2008|title=Trash Racks|publisher=Adelaide and Mount Lofty Ranges Natural Resources Management Board|accessdate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In lakes or near the coast, manual removal can also be used. [[Project AWARE]] for example promotes the idea of letting dive clubs clean up litter, for example as a diving exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectaware.org/project/10Tips|title=10 Tips for Divers to Protect the Ocean Planet|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923111851/http://www.projectaware.org/project/10Tips|archivedate=23 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the sea, the removal of artificial debris (i.e. plastics) is still in its infancy. However some projects have been started which used ships with nets (Kaisei and New Horizon) to catch some plastics, primarily for research purposes. Another method to gather artificial litter has been proposed by [[Boyan Slat]]. He suggested using platforms with arms to gather the debris, situated inside the current of gyres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=MarineDebris.Info |url=http://marinedebris.info/wiki/great-pacific-garbage-patch |title=Methods for collecting plastic litter at sea |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024154340/http://marinedebris.info/wiki/great-pacific-garbage-patch |archive-date=24 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another issue is that removing marine debris from our oceans can potentially cause more harm than good. Cleaning up micro-plastics could also accidentally take out plankton, which are the main lower level food group for the marine food chain and over half of the photosynthesis on earth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  One of the most efficient and cost effective ways to help reduce the amount of plastic entering our oceans is to not participate in using single use plastics, avoid plastic bottled drinks such as water bottles, use reusable shopping bags, and to buy products with reusable packaging.&lt;ref&gt;Wabnitz, C., &amp; Nichols, W. J. (2010). Editorial: Plastic pollution: An ocean emergency. ''Marine Turtle Newsletter,'' (129), 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

On land the distinction between deliberate and accidental loss led to the concept of a "[[treasure trove]]". In the [[United Kingdom]], shipwrecked goods should be reported to a [[Receiver of Wreck]], and if identifiable, they should be returned to their rightful owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6287047.stm |title=Can you keep ship-wrecked goods? |accessdate=29 May 2008 |date=22 January 2007 |publisher=BBC News |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123152554/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6287047.stm |archivedate=23 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
A large number of groups and individuals are active in preventing or educating about marine debris. For example, [[5 Gyres]] is an organization aimed at reducing plastics pollution in the oceans, and was one of two organizations that recently researched the [[Great Pacific Garbage Patch]]. [[Heal the Bay]] is another organization, focusing on protecting [[California]]'s [[Santa Monica Bay]], by sponsoring beach cleanup programs along with other activities. [[Marina DeBris]] is an artist focusing most of her recent work on educating people about beach trash.

Forty-eight plastics manufacturers from 25 countries, are members of the Global Plastic Associations for solutions on Marine Litter, have made the pledge to help prevent marine debris and to encourage recycling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Mitigation ===
[[File:How_long_until_it's_gone.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The decomposition times of marine debris]]

Marine debris is a problem created by all of us, not only those in coastal regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chow|first=Lorraine|date=29 June 2016|title=80% Of Ocean Plastic Comes From Land-Based Sources, New Report Finds.|url=http://www.ecowatch.com/80-of-ocean-plastic-comes-from-land-based-sources-new-report-finds-1891173457.html.|journal=EcoWatch|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ocean debris can come from as far away as Nebraska. The places that see the most damage are often not the places that produce the pollution. For ocean pollution, much of the trash may come from inland states, where people may never see the ocean and thus may never put any thought into protecting it. The problem continues to grow in tandem with plastics usage and disposal. Steps can be taken to prevent the movement of inland plastics into the oceans.

Plastic debris from inland states come from two main sources: ordinary litter and materials from open dumps and landfills that blow or wash away to inland waterways and wastewater outflows. The refuse finds its way from inland waterways, rivers, streams and lakes to the ocean. Though ocean and coastal area cleanups are important, it is crucial to address plastic waste that originates from inland and landlocked states.&lt;ref&gt;Tibbetts, J. H. (2015). Managing Marine Plastic Pollution. ''Environmental Health Perspectives'', ''123''(4), A90-A93. doi:10.1289/ehp.123-A90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oceanicsociety.org/blog/1720/7-ways-to-reduce-ocean-plastic-pollution-todayStrategies|title=7 Ways To Reduce Ocean Plastic Pollution Today|website=www.oceanicsociety.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-29|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330075852/https://www.oceanicsociety.org/blog/1720/7-ways-to-reduce-ocean-plastic-pollution-todayStrategies|archivedate=30 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the systems level, there are various ways to reduce the amount of debris entering our waterways:
* Improve waste transportation to and from sites by utilizing closed container storage and shipping
* Restrict open waste facilities near waterways
* Promote the use of [[Refuse-derived fuel]]s. Used plastic with low residual value often do not get recycled and are more likely to leak into the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;''Stemming the tide: Land-based strategies for a plastic-free ocean'' (pp. 1-48, Rep.). (2015). McKinsey Center for Business and Environment.&lt;/ref&gt; However, turning these unwanted plastics that would otherwise stay in landfills into refuse-derived fuels allows for further use; they can be used as supplement fuels at power plants
* Improve recovery rates for plastic (in 2012, the United States generated 11.46 million tons of plastic waste, of which only 6.7% was recovered&lt;ref&gt;EPA. Municipal Solid Waste Generation, Recycling, and Disposal in the United States: Facts and Figures for 2012 [fact sheet]. Washington, DC:U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (February 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adapt [[Extended producer responsibility|Extended Producer Responsibility]] strategies to make producers responsible for product management when products and their packaging become waste; encourage reusable product design to minimize negative impacts on the environment&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Jennifer, and Christopher Bosso. “Extended Producer Responsibility in the United States.” Journal of Industrial Ecology, vol. 17, no. 2, 2013, pp. 175–185., doi:10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00572.x.&lt;/ref&gt;
As consumers, there are things we can do to help reduce the amount of plastic entering our waterways:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
[[File:7_Swaps.jpg|thumb|7 simple single-use swaps people can make to save trash.]]
* Reduce usage of single-use plastics such as plastic bags, straws, water bottles, utensils and coffee cups by replacing them with reusable products such as reusable bags, metal straws, reusable water bottles, bamboo toothbrushes and reusable coffee cups
* Avoid microbeads, which are found in face scrubs, toothpastes and body washes
* Participate in a river or lake beach clean up
* Support municipality bans and other legislation regulating single-use plastics and plastic waste 
* Continue to recycle, recycle, recycle
Though the awareness of inland ocean conservation debris mitigation seems to be small compared to coastal states, some organizations in the United States are already working to improve this. The Colorado Ocean Coalition was formed in 2011 with the goal of impressing upon inland citizens that they don’t need to see the ocean to care about its health. It has since grown beyond one state and now forms the [https://inlandoceancoalition.org Inland Ocean Coalition], with the mission of promoting knowledge and awareness of how inland states contribute to pollution of the ocean, aiming to shatter the ‘out of sight, out of mind’ mentality that often applies in this region.

“Those who live among mountains, rivers and inland cities have a direct impact on the cycle of life in the ocean,” reads the [https://inlandoceancoalition.org IOCO] website. "The changes we need to make to address the largest threats facing our seas—lowering carbon emissions, reducing trash and pollution, eating sustainable seafood, safeguarding watersheds, promoting marine protected areas (MPAs)—can happen from anywhere in the world.”

This organization has chapters in many inland US states and promotes programs like watershed cleanups, youth-centered education, and decreasing the use of plastic.

=== Plastic-to-fuel conversion strategy ===

[[The Clean Oceans Project|The Clean Oceans Project (TCOP)]] promotes conversion of the plastic waste into valuable liquid fuels, including [[gasoline]], [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[kerosene]], using plastic-to-fuel conversion technology developed by Blest Co. Ltd., a Japanese [[environmental engineering]] company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mosko |first=Sarah |title=Mid-Ocean Plastics Cleanup Schemes: Too Little Too Late? |url=http://www.emagazine.com/blog/mid-ocean-plastics-cleanup-schemes-too-little-too-late |publisher=E-The Environmental Magazine |accessdate=25 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212044741/http://www.emagazine.com/blog/mid-ocean-plastics-cleanup-schemes-too-little-too-late |archivedate=12 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jimholm&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Holm: The Clean Oceans Project|url=http://tedxgramercy.com/talk?a96d952bade720720be27c4bc50018fe|publisher=TEDxGramercy|accessdate=24 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210180721/http://tedxgramercy.com/talk?a96d952bade720720be27c4bc50018fe|archivedate=10 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamel|first=Jessi|title=From Trash to Fuel|url=http://www.gtweekly.com/index.php/santa-cruz-news/santa-cruz-environmental-news/2392-from-trash-to-fuel.html|publisher=Santa Cruz Good Times|accessdate=24 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425003518/http://www.gtweekly.com/index.php/santa-cruz-news/santa-cruz-environmental-news/2392-from-trash-to-fuel.html|archivedate=25 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=West|first=Amy E.|title=Santa Cruz nonprofit hopes to make fuel from ocean-based plastic|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_19658573|publisher=San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=24 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425003927/http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_19658573|archivedate=25 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; TCOP plans to educate local communities and create a financial [[incentive]] for them to [[recycle]] plastic, keep their shorelines clean, and minimize plastic waste.&lt;ref name = jimholm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Response|url=http://thecleanoceansproject.com/?page_id=18|publisher=The Clean Oceans Project|accessdate=24 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140425021325/http://thecleanoceansproject.com/?page_id=18|archivedate=25 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
===Primary microplastics===
Primary microplastics are small pieces of plastic that are purposefully manufactured&lt;ref name="KarbalaeiHWC" /&gt;. They are usually used in facial [[cleanser]]s and [[cosmetics]], or in [[Air blaster|air blasting]] technology. In some cases, their use in medicine as [[drug vector|vectors for drugs]] was reported.&lt;ref name="Patel,2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Patel|first1=Mayur M.|last2=Goyal|first2=Bhoomika R.|last3=Bhadada|first3=Shraddha V.|last4=Bhatt|first4=Jay S.|last5=Amin|first5=Avani F.|date=January 2009|title=Getting into the Brain: Approaches to Enhance Brain Drug Delivery|url=|journal=[[CNS Drugs]]|volume=23|issue=1|pages=35–58|doi=10.2165/0023210-200923010-00003|pmid=19062774|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microplastic "scrubbers", used in [[exfoliating]] hand cleansers and facial scrubs, have replaced traditionally used natural ingredients, including ground [[Almond|almonds]], [[oatmeal]], and [[pumice]]. Primary microplastics have also been produced for use in air blasting technology. This process involves blasting [[acrylate polymer|acrylic]], [[melamine]], or [[polyester]] microplastic scrubbers at machinery, engines, and boat hulls to remove rust and paint. As these scrubbers are used repeatedly until they diminish in size and their cutting power is lost, they often become contaminated with [[heavy metal (chemical element)|heavy metals]] such as [[cadmium]], [[chromium]], and [[lead]].&lt;ref name="Cole Mathew,2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cole |first1=Matthew |last2=Lindeque |first2=Pennie |last3=Halsband |first3=Claudia |last4=Galloway |first4=Tamara S. |date=December 2011 |title=Microplastics as contaminants in the marine environment: A review |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=62 |issue=12 |pages=2588–2597 |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2011.09.025|pmid=22001295 |hdl=10871/19649 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many companies have committed to reducing the production of microbeads, there are still many bioplastic microbeads that also have a long degradation life cycle similar to normal plastic.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Secondary microplastics===
Secondary plastics are small pieces of plastic derived from the breakdown of larger plastic debris, both at sea and on land. Over time, a culmination of physical, biological, and chemphotodegradation, including photodegradation caused by sunlight exposure, can reduce the structural integrity of plastic debris to a size that is eventually undetectable to the naked eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Masura|first=Julie|last2=Baker|first2=Joel|last3=Foster|first3=Gregory|last4=Arthur|first4=Courtney|date=July 2015|editor-last=Herring|editor-first=Carlie|title=Laboratory Methods for the Analysis of Microplastics in the Marine Environment: Recommendations for quantifying synthetic particles in waters and sediments|url=|journal=[[NOAA|NOAA Marine Debris Program]]|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process of breaking down large plastic material into much smaller pieces is known as fragmentation.&lt;ref name="Cole Mathew,2011" /&gt; It is considered that microplastics might further degrade to be smaller in size, although the smallest microplastic reportedly detected in the oceans at present is 1.6 micrometres (6.3×10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; in) in diameter.[[Microplastics#cite%20note-Cole%20Mathew%2C2011-7|&lt;sup&gt;[7]&lt;/sup&gt;]] The prevalence of microplastics with uneven shapes suggests that fragmentation is a key source.[[Microplastics#cite%20note-8|&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

===Other sources: as a by-product/dust emission during wear and tear===
There are countless sources of both primary and secondary microplastics. Microplastic fibers enter the environment from the washing of synthetic clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.conserve-energy-future.com/sources-effect-microplastics-humans-animals-environment.php |title=What are the Sources of Microplastics and its Effect on Humans and the Environment? - Conserve Energy Future |date=2018-05-19 |work=Conserve Energy Future |access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00267-017-0947-8 |pmid=29043380 |title=Are We Underestimating Microplastic Contamination in Aquatic Environments? |journal=Environmental Management |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2018 |last1=Conkle |first1=Jeremy L. |last2=Báez Del Valle |first2=Christian D. |last3=Turner |first3=Jeffrey W. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tires, composed partly of synthetic styrene butadiene rubber, will erode into tiny plastic and rubber particles as they are used. Furthermore, 2.0-5.0 mm plastic pellets, used to create other plastic products, often enter ecosystems due to spillages and other accidents.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A Norwegian Environment Agency review report about microplastics published in early 2015&lt;ref name="Sundt and Schulze 2014"&gt;Sundt, Peter and Schulze, Per-Erik: "Sources of microplastic-pollution to the marine environment", "Mepex for the Norwegian Environment Agency", 2015&lt;/ref&gt; states it would be beneficial to classify these sources as primary, as long as microplastics from these sources are added from human society at the "start of the pipe", and their emissions are inherently a result of human material and product use and not secondary defragmentation in nature.

The existence of microplastics in the environment is often established through aquatic studies. These include taking [[plankton]] samples, analyzing sandy and muddy [[sediment]]s, observing [[vertebrate]] and [[invertebrate]] consumption, and evaluating chemical [[pollutant]] interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ivar do Sul|first1=Juliana A.|last2=Costa|first2=Monica F.|date=February 2014|title=The present and future of microplastic pollution in the marine environment|url=|journal=[[Environmental Pollution (journal)|Environmental Pollution]]|volume=185|pages=352–364|doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2013.10.036|pmid=24275078|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through such methods, it has been shown that there are microplastics from multiple sources in the environment.

Microplastics could contribute up to 30% of the [[Great Pacific garbage patch|Great Pacific Garbage Patch]] polluting the world’s oceans and, in many developed countries, are a bigger source of marine plastic pollution than the visible larger pieces of marine litter, according to a 2017 [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] report.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Sewage treatment plants ===
[[Sewage treatment]] plants, also known as wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), remove contaminants from wastewater, primarily from household sewage, using various physical, chemical, and biological processes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Most plants in developed countries have both [[Sewage treatment#Primary treatment|primary]] and [[secondary treatment]] stages. In the primary stage of treatment, physical processes are employed to remove oils, sand, and other large solids using conventional filters, [[clarifier]]s, and settling tanks.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite report |date=1997 |title=Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Treatment |url=https://www.epa.ie/pubs/advice/water/wastewater/EPA_water_%20treatment_manual_primary_secondary_tertiary1.pdf |series=Wastewater Treatment Manuals |publisher=Environmental Protection Agency, Ireland |location=Wexford}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondary treatment uses biological processes involving [[bacteria]] and [[protozoa]] to break down organic matter. Common secondary technologies are [[activated sludge]] systems, [[trickling filter]]s, and [[constructed wetland]]s. The optional tertiary treatment stage may include processes for nutrient removal ([[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]) and [[disinfection]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Microplastics have been detected in both the primary and secondary treatment stages of the plants. A study estimated that about one particle per liter of microplastics are being released back into the environment, with a removal efficiency of about 99.9%.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carr|first=Steve A.|last2=Liu|first2=Jin|last3=Tesoro|first3=Arnold G.|date=15 March 2016|title=Transport and fate of microplastic particles in wastewater treatment plants|url=|journal=[[Water Research]]|volume=91|pages=174–182|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2016.01.002|pmid=26795302|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Estahbanati|first=Shirin|last2=Fahrenfeld|first2=N.L.|date=November 2016|title=Influence of wastewater treatment plant discharges on microplastic concentrations in surface water|url=http://raritan.rutgers.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Estahbanati-Fahrenfeld-2016-Influence-of-wastewater-treatment-plant-discharges-on-microplastic-concentratison-in-surface-water.pdf|journal=[[Chemosphere (journal)|Chemosphere]]|volume=162|pages=277–284|doi=10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.07.083|pmid=27508863|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mintenig|first=S.M.|last2=Int-Veen|first2=I.|last3=Löder|first3=M.G.J.|last4=Primpke|first4=S.|last5=Gerdts|first5=G.|date=2017-01-01|title=Identification of microplastic in effluents of waste water treatment plants using focal plane array-based micro-Fourier-transform infrared imaging|url=|journal=[[Water Research]]|volume=108|pages=365–372|doi=10.1016/j.watres.2016.11.015|pmid=27838027|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study showed that most microplastics are actually removed during the primary treatment stage where solid skimming and sludge settling are used.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When these treatment facilities are functioning properly, the contribution of microplastics into oceans and surface water environments from WWTPs is not disproportionately large.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Murphy|first=Fionn|last2=Ewins|first2=Ciaran|last3=Carbonnier|first3=Frederic|last4=Quinn|first4=Brian|date=2016-06-07|title=Wastewater Treatment Works (WwTW) as a Source of Microplastics in the Aquatic Environment|url=|journal=[[Environmental Science &amp; Technology]]|volume=50|issue=11|pages=5800–5808|doi=10.1021/acs.est.5b05416|pmid=27191224|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is important to note that in certain countries sewage sludge is used for soil fertilizer, which exposes plastics in the sludge to the weather, sunlight, and other biological factors, causing fragmentation. As a result, microplastics from these biosolids often end up in storm drains and eventually into bodies of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weithmann|first=Nicolas|last2=Möller|first2=Julia N.|last3=Löder|first3=Martin G. J.|last4=Piehl|first4=Sarah|last5=Laforsch|first5=Christian|last6=Freitag|first6=Ruth|date=2018-04-01|title=Organic fertilizer as a vehicle for the entry of microplastic into the environment|url=|journal=[[Science Advances]]|volume=4|issue=4|pages=eaap8060|doi=10.1126/sciadv.aap8060|pmc=5884690|pmid=29632891|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, some studies show that microplastics do pass through filtration processes at some WWTPs (Microplastics as Contaminants, 2011). According to a study from the UK, samples taken from sewage sludge disposal sites on the coasts of six continents contained an average one particle of microplastic per liter. A significant amount of these particles was of clothing fibers from washing machine effluent.&lt;ref name="Browne2011" /&gt;

=== Car and truck tires ===
Wear and tear from tires significantly contributes to the flow of (micro-)plastics into the environment. Estimates of emissions of microplastics to the environment in [[Denmark]] are between [[orders of magnitude (mass)#106 to 1011 kg|{{convert|5,500|and|14,000|tonne}}]] per year. Secondary microplastics (e.g. from car and truck tires or footwear) are more important than primary microplastics by two orders of magnitude. The formation of microplastics from the degradation of larger plastics in the environment is not accounted for in the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2015 |title=Microplastics: Occurrence, effects and sources of releases to the environment in Denmark |url=http://www2.mst.dk/Udgiv/publications/2015/10/978-87-93352-80-3.pdf |publisher=Ministry of Environment and Food in Denmark, Danish Environmental Protection Agency |location=Copenhagen |id=Environmental project No. 1793 |page=14 |isbn=978-87-93352-80-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The estimated per capita emission ranges from 0.23 to 4.7 kg/year, with a global average of 0.81 kg/year. The emissions from car tires (100%) are substantially higher than those of other sources of microplastics, e.g., airplane tires (2%), artificial turf (12–50%), brake wear (8%), and road markings (5%). Emissions and pathways depend on local factors like road type or sewage systems. The relative contribution of tire wear and tear to the total global amount of plastics ending up in our oceans is estimated to be 5–10%. In air, 3–7% of the particulate matter (PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;) is estimated to consist of tire wear and tear, indicating that it may contribute to the global health burden of air pollution which has been projected by the World Health Organization (WHO) at 3 million deaths in 2012. The wear and tear also enter our food chain, but further research is needed to assess human health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kole|first=Pieter Jan|last2=Löhr|first2=Ansje J.|last3=Van Belleghem|first3=Frank|last4=Ragas|first4=Ad|last5=Kole|first5=Pieter Jan|last6=Löhr|first6=Ansje J.|last7=Van Belleghem|first7=Frank G.

===Cosmetics industry===
Some companies have replaced natural [[exfoliating]] ingredients with microplastics, usually in the form of "[[microbead]]s" or "micro-exfoliates". These products are typically composed of [[polyethylene]], a common component of plastics, but they can also be manufactured from [[polypropylene]], [[polyethylene terephthalate]], and [[nylon]].&lt;ref name="BeattheMicrobead"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatthemicrobead.org/en/|title=International Campaign against Microbeads in Cosmetics|last=|first=|date=|website=Beat the Microbead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315021442/http://beatthemicrobead.org/en/|archive-date=15 March 2015|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often found in face washes, [[hand soap]]s, and other personal care products, so the beads are usually washed into the [[sewage]] system immediately after use. Their small size prevents them from fully being retained by preliminary treatment screens at wastewater plants, thereby allowing some to enter rivers and oceans.&lt;ref name="Fendall2009"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2009.04.025 |pmid=19481226 |title=Contributing to marine pollution by washing your face: Microplastics in facial cleansers |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=58 |issue=8 |pages=1225–1228 |year=2009 |last1=Fendall |first1=Lisa S. |last2=Sewell |first2=Mary A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, wastewater treatment plants only remove an average of 95–99.9% of microbeads because of their small design . This leaves an average of 0-7 microbeads per litre being discharged.&lt;ref name=pmid27836135&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2016.10.048 |pmid=27836135 |title=Microplastics in personal care products: Exploring perceptions of environmentalists, beauticians and students |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=113 |issue=1–2 |pages=454–460 |year=2016 |last1=Anderson |first1=A.G. |last2=Grose |first2=J. |last3=Pahl |first3=S. |last4=Thompson |first4=R.C. |last5=Wyles |first5=K.J. |url=http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/812629/1/Anderson%20et%20al%20%282016%29%20-%20MPB%20-%20microbeads%20%28accepted%20manuscript%29.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that one treatment plant discharges 160 trillion liters of water per day, around 8 trillion microbeads are released into waterways every day.&lt;ref name=pmid27836135/&gt; This averages out to around 8 trillion microbeads being released into waterways per day. This number doesn’t account for the sewage sludge that is reused as fertilizer after the waste water treatment that has been know to still contain these microbeads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/acs.est.5b03909 |pmid=26334581 |title=Scientific Evidence Supports a Ban on Microbeads |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=49 |issue=18 |pages=10759–10761 |year=2015 |last1=Rochman |first1=Chelsea M. |last2=Kross |first2=Sara M. |last3=Armstrong |first3=Jonathan B. |last4=Bogan |first4=Michael T. |last5=Darling |first5=Emily S. |last6=Green |first6=Stephanie J. |last7=Smyth |first7=Ashley R. |last8=Veríssimo |first8=Diogo }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an issue at the household level because it has been estimated that around 808 trillion beads per household are discharged in a single day whether due to cosmetic exfoliates, face wash, toothpaste, or other sources. Although many companies have committed to phasing out the use of microbead in their products a research found that there are at least 80 different facial scrub products that are still being sold with microbeads as a main component.&lt;ref name=pmid27836135/&gt; This fact contributes to the total of 80 metric tons of microbead discharge per year just by the United Kingdom alone. This not only has a negative impact on the wildlife and food chain but also in terms of toxicity because plastics such as microbeads have been proven to absorb dangerous chemicals such as pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name=pmid27836135/&gt;

===Clothing===
Studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.leitat.org/mermaids/|title=LIFE-MERMAIDS Project|last=|first=|date=2014-08-08|website=LEITAT|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that many synthetic fibers, such as polyester, nylon and acrylics, can be shed from clothing and persist in the environment.&lt;ref name = "GrossmanJan"&gt;Grossman, Elizabeth: “How Microplastics from Your Fleece Could End up on Your Plate”, “Civil Eats”, January 15, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Each garment in a load of [[laundry]] can shed more than 1,900 fibers of microplastics, with [[Polar fleece|fleeces]] releasing the highest percentage of fibers, over 170% more than other garments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.1504135112 |pmid=25944930 |pmc=4426466 |title=News Feature: Microplastics present pollution puzzle |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=112 |issue=18 |pages=5547–5549 |year=2015 |last1=Katsnelson |first1=Alla }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Browne2011"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es201811s |pmid=21894925 |title=Accumulation of Microplastic on Shorelines Woldwide: Sources and Sinks |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=45 |issue=21 |pages=9175–9179 |year=2011 |last1=Browne |first1=Mark Anthony |last2=Crump |first2=Phillip |last3=Niven |first3=Stewart J. |last4=Teuten |first4=Emma |last5=Tonkin |first5=Andrew |last6=Galloway |first6=Tamara |last7=Thompson |first7=Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Washing machine]] manufacturers have also reviewed research into whether washing machine filters can reduce the amount of microfiber fibers that need to be treated by water treatment facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.patagonia.com/blog/2017/02/an-update-on-microfiber-pollution/|title=An Update on Microfiber Pollution|last=|first=|date=2017-02-03|website=Patagonia|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; These microfibers have been found to persist throughout the food chain from [[zooplankton]] to larger animals such as whales.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The primary fiber that persist throughout the textile industry is polyester which is a cheap cotton alternative that can be easily manufactured. However, these types of fibers contribute greatly to the persistence to microplastics in terrestrial, aerial, and marine ecosystems. The process of washing clothes causes garments to lose an average of over 100 fibers per liter of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es201811s |pmid=21894925 |title=Accumulation of Microplastic on Shorelines Woldwide: Sources and Sinks |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=45 |issue=21 |pages=9175–9179 |year=2011 |last1=Browne |first1=Mark Anthony |last2=Crump |first2=Phillip |last3=Niven |first3=Stewart J. |last4=Teuten |first4=Emma |last5=Tonkin |first5=Andrew |last6=Galloway |first6=Tamara |last7=Thompson |first7=Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been linked with health effects possibly caused by the release of monomers, dispersive dyes, mordants, and plasticisers from manufacturing. The commonality of these types of fibers in the common households has been shown to represent 33% of all fibers in indoor environments.&lt;ref name="Browne2011" /&gt;

Anthropomorphic fibers have been studied in both indoor and outdoor environments to study the concentration of these to see what the average human exposure to microfibers look like. The indoor concentration was 1.0–60.0 fibers/m^3 whereas the outdoor concentration was much lower at 0.3-1.5 fibers/m^3.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2016.12.013 |pmid=27989388 |title=A first overview of textile fibers, including microplastics, in indoor and outdoor environments |journal=Environmental Pollution |volume=221 |pages=453–458 |year=2017 |last1=Dris |first1=Rachid |last2=Gasperi |first2=Johnny |last3=Mirande |first3=Cécile |last4=Mandin |first4=Corinne |last5=Guerrouache |first5=Mohamed |last6=Langlois |first6=Valérie |last7=Tassin |first7=Bruno |url=https://hal-enpc.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01418927/file/dris2017.pdf |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; The deposition rate indoors was 1586-11,130 fibers per day/m^3 which accumulates to around 190-670 fibers/mg of dust.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The largest concern with these concentrations is that it increases exposure to children and the elderly which can cause adverse health effects.

===Manufacturing===
The manufacture of plastic products uses [[granular material|granules]] and small [[resin]] pellets as their raw material. In the United States, production increased from 2.9 million pellets in 1960 to 21.7 million pellets in 1987. Through accidental spillage during land or sea transport, inappropriate use as [[packing material]]s, and direct outflow from processing plants, these raw materials can enter [[aquatic ecosystem]]s. In an assessment of [[Sweden|Swedish]] waters using an 80&amp;nbsp;µm mesh, KIMO Sweden found typical microplastic concentrations of 150–2,400 microplastics per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; in a harbor adjacent to a plastic production facility, the concentration was 102,000 per m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Cole Mathew,2011"/&gt;

Many industrial sites in which convenient raw plastics are frequently used are located near bodies of water. If spilled during production, these materials may leak into the surrounding environment, polluting waterways.&lt;ref name="Sundt and Schulze 2014" /&gt; “More recently, Operation Cleansweep (www.opcleansweep.org), a joint initiative of the American Chemistry Council and Society of the Plastics Industry, is aiming for industries to commit to zero pellet loss during their operations”.&lt;ref name="Cole Mathew,2011" /&gt; Overall, there is a significant lack of research conducted about specific industries and companies that contribute to microplastics pollution.

===Fishing industry===
[[Recreational fishing|Recreational]] and [[commercial fishing]], [[marine vessel]]s, and marine industries are all sources of plastic that can directly enter the marine environment, posing a risk to biota both as macroplastics, and as secondary microplastics following long-term degradation. [[Marine debris]] observed on beaches also arises from beaching of materials carried on inshore and ocean currents. [[Fishing gear]] is a form of plastic debris with a marine source. Discarded or lost fishing gear, including plastic monofilament line and nylon [[fishing net|netting]], is typically neutrally [[buoyant]] and can, therefore, drift at variable depths within the oceans. Various countries have reported that microplastics from the industry and other sources have been accumulating in different types of seafood. In [[Indonesia]], 55% of all fish species had evidence of manufactured debris similar to America which reported 67%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/srep14340 |pmid=26399762 |pmc=4585829 |title=Anthropogenic debris in seafood: Plastic debris and fibers from textiles in fish and bivalves sold for human consumption |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=5 |pages=14340 |year=2015 |last1=Rochman |first1=Chelsea M. |last2=Tahir |first2=Akbar |last3=Williams |first3=Susan L. |last4=Baxa |first4=Dolores V. |last5=Lam |first5=Rosalyn |last6=Miller |first6=Jeffrey T. |last7=Teh |first7=Foo-Ching |last8=Werorilangi |first8=Shinta |last9=Teh |first9=Swee J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the majority of debris in Indonesia was plastic, while in North America the majority was synthetic fibers found in clothing and some types of nets. The implication that fish are being contaminated with microplastic is that those plastics and chemicals will bioaccumulate in the food chain.

One study analyzed the plastic-derived chemical called [[polybrominated diphenyl ethers]] (PBDEs) in the stomachs of [[short-tailed shearwater]]s. It found that one-fourth of the birds had higher-brominated congeners that are not naturally found in their prey. However, the PBDE got into the birds' systems through plastic that was found in the stomachs of the birds. It is therefore not just the plastics that are being transferred through the food chain but the chemicals from the plastics as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2012.12.010 |pmid=23298431 |title=Accumulation of plastic-derived chemicals in tissues of seabirds ingesting marine plastics |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=69 |issue=1–2 |pages=219–222 |year=2013 |last1=Tanaka |first1=Kosuke |last2=Takada |first2=Hideshige |last3=Yamashita |first3=Rei |last4=Mizukawa |first4=Kaoruko |last5=Fukuwaka |first5=Masa-aki |last6=Watanuki |first6=Yutaka }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Packaging and shipping===
[[Shipping]] has significantly contributed to marine pollution. Some statistics indicate that in 1970, commercial shipping fleets around the world dumped over 23,000 tons of plastic waste into the marine environment. In 1988, an international agreement ([[MARPOL 73/78]], Annex V) prohibited the dumping of waste from ships into the marine environment. However, shipping remains a dominant source of [[plastic pollution#Ocean|plastic pollution]], having contributed around 6.5 million tons of plastic in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="Derraik2002"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0025-326X(02)00220-5 |title=The pollution of the marine environment by plastic debris: A review |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=44 |issue=9 |pages=842–852 |year=2002 |last1=Derraik |first1=José G.B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0284 |pmid=19528054 |pmc=2873017 |title=Transport and release of chemicals from plastics to the environment and to wildlife |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=364 |issue=1526 |pages=2027–2045 |year=2009 |last1=Teuten |first1=E.

This waste from the Chinese company [[Sinopec]] was reported to have piled up in large quantities on beaches.&lt;ref name="Sundt and Schulze 2014" /&gt; While this is a large incident of spillage, researchers speculate that smaller accidents also occur and further contribute to marine microplastic pollution.&lt;ref name="Sundt and Schulze 2014" /&gt; 

=== Plastic water bottles ===
In one study, 93% of the bottled water from 11 different brands showed microplastic contamination.

==Potential effects on the environment==
{{split section|Environmental impacts of microplastics|date=September 2016}}
Participants at the 2008 International Research Workshop on the Occurrence, Effects and Fate of Microplastic Marine Debris at the [[University of Washington]] at Tacoma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-last=Arthur |editor1-first=Courtney |editor2-last=Baker |editor2-first=Joel |editor3-last=Bamford |editor3-first=Holly |title=Proceedings of the Intenational Research Workshop on the Occurrence, Effects, and Fate of Microplastic Marine Debris, September 9-11, 2008 |journal=Technical Memorandum NOS-OR&amp;R-30 |date=2009 |pages=49 |url=https://marinedebris.noaa.gov/file/2192/download?token=5dvqb-YY |accessdate=2018-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that microplastics are a problem in the marine environment, based on:
*the documented occurrence of microplastics in the marine environment,
*the long residence times of these particles (and, therefore, their likely buildup in the future), and
*their demonstrated ingestion by [[marine organism]]s.

So far, research has mainly focused on larger plastic items. Widely-recognized problems facing marine life are entanglement, ingestion, [[suffocation]] and general debilitation often leading to death and/or strandings. This causes serious public concern. In contrast, microplastics are not as conspicuous, being less than 5&amp;nbsp; mm, and are usually invisible to the naked eye. Particles of this size are available to a much broader range of species, enter the food chain at the bottom, become embedded in animal tissue, and are then undetectable by unaided visual inspection.

Microplastics have been detected not just in marine but also in freshwater systems in three continents (Europe, North America and Asia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eerkes-Medrano |first1=D. |last2=Thompson |first2=R.C. |last3=Aldridge |first3=D.C. |date=May 2015 |title=Microplastics in freshwater systems: A review of the emerging threats, identification of knowledge gaps and prioritisation of research needs |url= |journal=Water Research |volume=75 |issue= |pages=63–82 |doi=10.1016/j.watres.2015.02.012|pmid=25746963 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Samples collected across 29 [[Great Lakes]] tributaries from six states in the United States were found to contain plastic particles, 98% of which were microplastics ranging in size from 0.355mm to 4.75mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baldwin |first1=Austin K. |last2=Corsi |first2=Steven R. |last3=Mason |first3=Sherri A. |date=2016 |title=Plastic Debris in 29 Great Lakes Tributaries: Relations to Watershed Attributes and Hydrology |url= |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=50 |issue=19 |pages=10377–10385 |doi=10.1021/acs.est.6b02917|pmid=27627676 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological integration into organisms===
Microplastics can become embedded in animals' tissue through ingestion or respiration. Various annelid species, such as deposit-feeding [[Lugworm|lugworms]] (''Arenicola marina''), have been shown to have microplastics embedded in their [[gastrointestinal tract]]s. Many [[Crustacean|crustaceans]], like the shore crab ''[[Carcinus maenas]]'', have been seen to integrate microplastics into both their respiratory and digestive tracts.&lt;ref name = "GrossmanJan" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid24972075&gt;{{cite journal |laydate=8 July 2014 |laysummary=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/microplastics-lodge-crab-gills-and-guts |laysource=Science News |doi=10.1021/es501090e |pmid=24972075 |title=Uptake and Retention of Microplastics by the Shore Crab Carcinus maenas |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=48 |issue=15 |pages=8823–8830 |year=2014 |last1=Watts |first1=Andrew J.

E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Bottom feeder|bottom feeders]], such as [[benthic]] [[Sea cucumber|sea cucumbers]], who are non-selective scavengers that feed on debris on the ocean floor, ingest large amounts of sediment. It has been shown that four species of sea cucumber (''Thyonella gemmate'', ''[[Holothuria floridana]]'', ''H. grisea'' and ''[[Cucumaria frondosa]]'') ingested between 2- and 20-fold more PVC fragments and between 2- and 138-fold more nylon line fragments (as much as 517 fibers per organism) based on plastic-to-sand grain ratios from each sediment treatment. These results suggest that individuals may be selectively ingesting plastic particles. This contradicts the accepted indiscriminate feeding strategy of sea cucumbers, and may occur in all presumed non-selective feeders when presented with microplastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2013.02.031 |pmid=23545014 |title=The physical impacts of microplastics on marine organisms: A review |journal=Environmental Pollution |volume=178 |pages=483–492 |year=2013 |last1=Wright |first1=Stephanie L. |last2=Thompson |first2=Richard C. |last3=Galloway |first3=Tamara S. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only fish and free-living organisms can ingest microplastics. [[Scleractinia|Scleractinian corals]], which are primary reef-builders, have been shown to ingest microplastics under laboratory conditions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=N.M. |last1=Hall |first2=K.L.E. |last2=Berry |first3=L. |last3=Rintoul |first4=M.O. |last4=Hoogenboom |date=4 February 2015 |title=Microplastic ingestion by scleractinian corals |journal=Marine Biology |doi=10.1007/s00227-015-2619-7 |volume=162 |issue=3 |pages=725–732}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the effects of ingestion on these corals has not been studied, corals can easily become stressed and bleach. Microplastics have been shown to stick to the exterior of the corals after exposure in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The adherence to the outside of corals can potentially be harmful, because corals cannot handle sediment or any particulate matter on their exterior and slough it off by secreting mucus, and they expend a large amount of energy in the process, increasing the chances of mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1007/978-90-481-2639-2_25 |chapter=Impacts of Sediment on Coral Reefs |title=Encyclopedia of Modern Coral Reefs |pages=575–586 |series=Encyclopedia of Earth Sciences Series |year=2011 |last1=Risk |first1=Michael J. |last2=Edinger |first2=Evan |isbn=978-90-481-2638-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zooplankton]] ingest microplastics beads (1.7–30.6 μm) and excrete fecal matter contaminated with microplastics. Along with ingestion, the microplastics stick to the appendages and exoskeleton of the zooplankton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es400663f |pmid=23692270 |title=Microplastic Ingestion by Zooplankton |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=47 |issue=12 |pages=6646–6655 |year=2013 |last1=Cole |first1=Matthew |last2=Lindeque |first2=Pennie |last3=Fileman |first3=Elaine |last4=Halsband |first4=Claudia |last5=Goodhead |first5=Rhys |last6=Moger |first6=Julian |last7=Galloway |first7=Tamara S. |hdl=10871/19651 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zooplankton, among other marine organisms, consume microplastics because they emit similar infochemicals, notably [[dimethyl sulfide]], just as [[phytoplankton]] do.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/sciadv.1600395 |pmid=28861463 |pmc=5569953 |title=Marine plastic debris emits a keystone infochemical for olfactory foraging seabirds |journal=Science Advances |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=e1600395 |year=2016 |last1=Savoca |first1=M.

It can take at least 14 days for microplastics to pass through an animal (as compared to a normal digestion periods of 2 days), but enmeshment of the particles in animals' [[gill]]s can prevent elimination entirely.&lt;ref name=pmid24972075/&gt; When microplastic-laden animals are consumed by predators, the microplastics are then incorporated into the bodies of higher trophic-level feeders. For example, scientists have reported plastic accumulation in the stomachs of [[lantern fish]] which are small filter feeders and are the main prey for commercial fish like [[tuna]] and [[swordfish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |laysource=Science News |laydate=1 July 2014 |laysummary=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/plastic-goes-missing-sea |doi=10.1073/pnas.1314705111 |pmid=24982135 |pmc=4104848 |title=Plastic debris in the open ocean |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=111 |issue=28 |pages=10239–10244 |year=2014 |last1=Cozar |first1=A. |last2=Echevarria |first2=F. |last3=Gonzalez-Gordillo |first3=J.

A study done at the Argentinean coastline of the [[Rio de la Plata]] [[estuary]], found the presence of microplastics in the guts of 11 species of coastal freshwater fish. These 11 species of fish represented four different feeding habits: [[detritivore]], [[planktivore]], [[omnivore]] and [[ichthyophagous]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.06.007 |pmid=28633946 |title=Microplastics in gut contents of coastal freshwater fish from Río de la Plata estuary |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=122 |issue=1–2 |pages=85–90 |year=2017 |last1=Pazos |first1=Rocío S. |last2=Maiztegui |first2=Tomás |last3=Colautti |first3=Darío C. |last4=Paracampo |first4=Ariel H. |last5=Gómez |first5=Nora }}&lt;/ref&gt; This study is one of the few so far to show the ingestion of microplastics by freshwater organisms.

====Humans====
Fish is a significant source of [[protein]] for the human population, accounting for 6.1% of all protein consumed globally in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i1820e/i1820e01.pdf|title=The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2010|last=|first=|date=2010|website=|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The microplastics ingested by fish and crustaceans can be subsequently consumed by humans as the end of the [[food chain]]&lt;ref name="KarbalaeiHWC" /&gt;. In a study done at the State University of New York, 18 fish species were sampled and all species showed some level of plastics in their systems.&lt;ref name="GrossmanJan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid24972075/&gt; Many additional researchers have found evidence that these fibers had become chemically associated with metals, [[polychlorinated biphenyls]], and other toxic contaminants while in water. The microplastic-metal [[chemical complex|complex]] can then enter humans via consumption.&lt;ref name="GrossmanJan"/&gt;

The primary concern with human health in regards to microplastics is more directed towards the different toxic and carcinogenic chemicals used to make these plastics and what they carry. It has also been thought that microplastics can act as a vector for pathogens as well as heavy metals&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weis|first=Judith|last2=Andrews|first2=Clinton J|last3=Dyksen|first3=John|last4=Ferrara|first4=Raymond|last5=Gannon|first5=John|last6=Laumbach|first6=Robert J|last7=Lederman|first7=Peter|last8=Lippencott|first8=Robert|last9=Rothman|first9=Nancy|date=2015|title=Human Health Impacts of Microplastics and Nanoplastics|url=https://www.state.nj.us/dep/sab/NJDEP-SAB-PHSC-final-2016.pdf|journal=NJDEP SAB Public Health Standing Committee|volume=|pages=23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

BPA is a commonly well-known substance that is an ingredient used to harden plastic that can also cause a wide range of disorders. Cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and abnormalities in liver enzymes are a few disorders that can arise from even small exposure to this chemical.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2009.0053 |pmid=19528062 |pmc=2873021 |title=Plastics, the environment and human health: Current consensus and future trends |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=364 |issue=1526 |pages=2153–2166 |year=2009 |last1=Thompson |first1=R.

Another dangerous ingredient is called Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) which is a flame retardant in many different types of plastics such as those used in microcircuits. This chemical has been linked to disruptions in thyroid hormones balance, pituitary function, and infertility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tox.2007.12.009 |pmid=18255212 |title=Endocrine effects of tetrabromobisphenol-A (TBBPA) in Wistar rats as tested in a one-generation reproduction study and a subacute toxicity study |journal=Toxicology |volume=245 |issue=1–2 |pages=76–89 |year=2008 |last1=Van Der Ven |first1=Leo T.M. |last2=Van De Kuil |first2=Ton |last3=Verhoef |first3=Aart |last4=Verwer |first4=Cynthia M. |last5=Lilienthal |first5=Hellmuth |last6=Leonards |first6=Pim E.G. |last7=Schauer |first7=Ute M.D. |last8=Cantón |first8=Rocío F. |last9=Litens |first9=Sabina |last10=De Jong |first10=Frank H. |last11=Visser |first11=Theo J. |last12=Dekant |first12=Wolfgang |last13=Stern |first13=Natalia |last14=Håkansson |first14=Helen |last15=Slob |first15=Wout |last16=Van Den Berg |first16=Martin |last17=Vos |first17=Josephus G. |last18=Piersma |first18=Aldert H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Many people can expect to come in contact with various types of microplastics on a daily basis in the aforementioned sources (see sources). However, the average citizen is exposed to microplastics through their various types of food included in a normal diet. For instance: Salt. Researchers in China tested three types of table salt samples available in supermarkets and found the presence of microplastics in all of them. [[Sea salt]] has the highest amounts of microplastics compared to lake salt and rock/well salt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/acs.est.5b03163 |pmid=26486565 |title=Microplastic Pollution in Table Salts from China |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=49 |issue=22 |pages=13622–13627 |year=2015 |last1=Yang |first1=Dongqi |last2=Shi |first2=Huahong |last3=Li |first3=Lan |last4=Li |first4=Jiana |last5=Jabeen |first5=Khalida |last6=Kolandhasamy |first6=Prabhu }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea salt and rock salt which are commonly used table salts in Spain have also been found to contain microplastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-09128-x |pmid=28819264 |pmc=5561224 |title=Microplastics in Spanish Table Salt |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=8620 |year=2017 |last1=Iñiguez |first1=Maria E. |last2=Conesa |first2=Juan A. |last3=Fullana |first3=Andres }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common type of microplastic found in both these studies was [[Polyethylene terephthalate|polyethylene terephthalate (PET).]]

An example of bioaccumulation in the food chain that leads to human exposure was a study done into the tissue samples of mussels to approximate concentration of microplastics. After research scientists estimate that an average citizen might be exposed to 123 MP articles/year/capita of microplastics through mussel consumption in the UK.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2018.02.069 |pmid=29604577 |title=Low levels of microplastics (MP) in wild mussels indicate that MP ingestion by humans is minimal compared to exposure via household fibres fallout during a meal |journal=Environmental Pollution |volume=237 |pages=675–684 |year=2018 |last1=Catarino |first1=Ana I. |last2=MacChia |first2=Valeria |last3=Sanderson |first3=William G. |last4=Thompson |first4=Richard C. |last5=Henry |first5=Theodore B. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering different diets it was also estimated that the microplastic exposure could go up to 4,620 particles/y/capita in countries with a higher shellfish consumption.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; However, it is also important to note that the humans on average are exposed to microplastics more in household dust than consuming mussels.

A 2018 study conducted on eight individuals from Europe and Japan found microplastics in [[human feces]] for the first time. All participants were found positive for at least one type of microplastics after all of them had consumed plastic-wrapped food and drunk water from plastic bottles while six had also eaten seafood. It was noted though that the study was small-sized, preliminary and unable to reveal the true origin of the plastic particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/23/health/microplastics-human-stool-pollution-intl/index.html |title=Microplastics found in human stools, research finds |first=Rob |last=Picheta |work=[[CNN]] |date=October 23, 2018 |accessdate=October 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2018/10/news-plastics-microplastics-human-feces/?user.testname=none |title=In a first, microplastics found in human poop |first=Laura |last=Parker |work=[[National Geographic]] |date=October 22, 2018 |accessdate=October 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buoyancy===
Approximately half of the plastic material introduced to the marine environment is [[buoyant]], but fouling by organisms can cause plastic debris to sink to the [[sea floor]], where it may interfere with sediment-dwelling species and sedimental gas exchange processes. Several factors contribute to microplastic’s buoyancy, including the density of the plastic it is composed as well as the size and shape of the microplastic fragments themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/srep33882 |pmid=27721460 |pmc=5056413 |title=The effect of particle properties on the depth profile of buoyant plastics in the ocean |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=6 |pages=33882 |year=2016 |last1=Kooi |first1=Merel |last2=Reisser |first2=Julia |last3=Slat |first3=Boyan |last4=Ferrari |first4=Francesco F. |last5=Schmid |first5=Moritz S. |last6=Cunsolo |first6=Serena |last7=Brambini |first7=Roberto |last8=Noble |first8=Kimberly |last9=Sirks |first9=Lys-Anne |last10=Linders |first10=Theo E.

Plastic particles may highly concentrate and transport synthetic organic compounds (e.g. persistent organic pollutants, [[POPs]]), commonly present in the environment and ambient seawater, on their surface through [[adsorption]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es0010498 |title=Plastic Resin Pellets as a Transport Medium for Toxic Chemicals in the Marine Environment |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=318–324 |year=2001 |last1=Mato |first1=Yukie |last2=Isobe |first2=Tomohiko |last3=Takada |first3=Hideshige |last4=Kanehiro |first4=Haruyuki |last5=Ohtake |first5=Chiyoko |last6=Kaminuma |first6=Tsuguchika }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microplastics can act as carriers for the transfer of POPs from the environment to organisms.&lt;ref name="Derraik2002"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0025-326X(02)00220-5 |title=The pollution of the marine environment by plastic debris: A review |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=44 |issue=9 |pages=842–852 |year=2002 |last1=Derraik |first1=José G.B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid19528054&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0284 |pmid=19528054 |pmc=2873017 |title=Transport and release of chemicals from plastics to the environment and to wildlife |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=364 |issue=1526 |pages=2027–2045 |year=2009 |last1=Teuten |first1=E.

Additives added to plastics during manufacture may leach out upon ingestion, potentially causing serious harm to the organism. [[Endocrine disruption]] by plastic additives may affect the [[reproductive health]] of humans and wildlife alike.&lt;ref name=pmid19528054/&gt;

Plastics, polymers derived from [[mineral oil]]s, are virtually [[non-biodegradable]]. However, renewable natural polymers are now in development which can be used for the production of biodegradable materials similar to that of oil-based polymers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

== Where microplastics can be found ==

=== Oceans ===
There is truly a staggering amount of microplastics in our world’s oceans. Though there is debate over exactly how much microplastic is in the world’s oceans a 2015 study estimated that there was between 93 and 236 thousand metric tons of microplastics in the world’s oceans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1088/1748-9326/10/12/124006 |title=A global inventory of small floating plastic debris |journal=Environmental Research Letters |volume=10 |issue=12 |pages=124006 |year=2015 |last1=Van Sebille |first1=Erik |last2=Wilcox |first2=Chris |last3=Lebreton |first3=Laurent |last4=Maximenko |first4=Nikolai |last5=Hardesty |first5=Britta Denise |last6=Van Franeker |first6=Jan A. |last7=Eriksen |first7=Marcus |last8=Siegel |first8=David |last9=Galgani |first9=Francois |last10=Law |first10=Kara Lavender }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2016/04/04/pesky-plastic-the-true-harm-of-microplastics-in-the-oceans/|title=Pesky plastic: The true harm of microplastics in the oceans – National Geographic Blog|website=blog.nationalgeographic.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the distribution of Eastern Pacific Ocean surface plastic debris helps to illustrate how the concentration of plastics in the ocean is on the rise. Though the study admits further research is needed to predict trends in ocean plastic concentration, the study, using data on surface plastic concentration (pieces of plastic km&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) from 1972-1985 n=60 and 2002-2012 n=457 within the same plastic accumulation zone, found the mean plastic concentration increase between the two sets of data, including a 10-fold increase of 18,160 to 189,800 pieces of plastic km&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es4053076 |pmid=24708264 |title=Distribution of Surface Plastic Debris in the Eastern Pacific Ocean from an 11-Year Data Set |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=48 |issue=9 |pages=4732–4738 |year=2014 |last1=Law |first1=Kara Lavender |last2=Morét-Ferguson |first2=Skye E. |last3=Goodwin |first3=Deborah S. |last4=Zettler |first4=Erik R. |last5=Deforce |first5=Emelia |last6=Kukulka |first6=Tobias |last7=Proskurowski |first7=Giora }}&lt;/ref&gt; And though this study is based on data of surface plastic concentration, not specifically microplastic, additional research has found microplastics to account for 92% of plastic debris on the ocean’s surface, which adds context to the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00267-017-0947-8 |pmid=29043380 |title=Are We Underestimating Microplastic Contamination in Aquatic Environments? |journal=Environmental Management |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=1–8 |year=2018 |last1=Conkle |first1=Jeremy L. |last2=Báez Del Valle |first2=Christian D. |last3=Turner |first3=Jeffrey W. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freshwater ecosystems ===
Though there have only been a few studies of microplastics in freshwater ecosystems, microplastics are being increasingly detected in the world’s aquatic environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.envpol.2016.06.074 |pmid=27431693 |title=Microplastics in aquatic environments: Implications for Canadian ecosystems |journal=Environmental Pollution |volume=218 |pages=269–280 |year=2016 |last1=Anderson |first1=Julie C. |last2=Park |first2=Bradley J. |last3=Palace |first3=Vince P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first study on microplastics in freshwater ecosystems was published in 2011 that found an average of 37.8 fragments per square meter of Lake Huron sediment samples. Additionally, studies have found MP (microplastic) to be present in all of the Great Lakes with an average concentration of 43,000 MP particle km&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/anie.201606957 |pmid=27618688 |title=Microplastic in Aquatic Ecosystems |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |volume=56 |issue=7 |pages=1720–1739 |year=2017 |last1=Ivleva |first1=Natalia P. |last2=Wiesheu |first2=Alexandra C. |last3=Niessner |first3=Reinhard }}&lt;/ref&gt; Microplastics have also been detected in freshwater ecosystems outside of the United States. The highest concentration of microplastic ever discovered in a studied freshwater ecosystem was recorded in the Rhine river at 4000 MP particles kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/acs.est.7b05367 |pmid=29337537 |pmc=5822217 |title=Microplastic Effect Thresholds for Freshwater Benthic Macroinvertebrates |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=52 |issue=4 |pages=2278–2286 |year=2018 |last1=Redondo-Hasselerharm |first1=Paula E. |last2=Falahudin |first2=Dede |last3=Peeters |first3=Edwin T. H. M. |last4=Koelmans |first4=Albert A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soil ===
A substantial portion of microplastics are expected to end up in the world’s soil, yet very little research has been conducted on microplastics in soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3389/fpls.2017.01805 |pmid=29093730 |pmc=5651362 |title=Microplastic Incorporation into Soil in Agroecosystems |journal=Frontiers in Plant Science |volume=8 |pages=1805 |year=2017 |last1=Rillig |first1=Matthias C. |last2=Ingraffia |first2=Rosolino |last3=De Souza Machado |first3=Anderson A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; There exists some speculation that fibrous secondary microplastics from washing machines could end up in soil through the failure of water treatment plants to completely filter out all of the microplastic fibers. Furthermore, [[geophagous soil fauna]], such as earthworms, mites, and collembolan could contribute to the amount of secondary microplastic present in soil by converting consumed plastic debris into microplastic via digestive processes. Further research, however, is needed. There is concrete data linking one the use of organic waste materials to synthetic fibers being found in the soil; but most studies on plastics in soil merely report its presence and do not quantify how much there is or where it came from.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/es302011r |pmid=22676039 |title=Microplastic in Terrestrial Ecosystems and the Soil? |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume=46 |issue=12 |pages=6453–6454 |year=2012 |last1=Rillig |first1=Matthias C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the air ===
Airborne microplastics have been detected in the [[Atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]], as well as indoors and outdoors. A 2017 study found indoor airborne microfiber concentrations between 1.0–60.0 microfibers per cubic meter (33% of which were found to be microplastics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.coesh.2017.10.002 |title=Microplastics in air: Are we breathing it in? |journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Science &amp; Health |volume=1 |pages=1–5 |year=2018 |last1=Gasperi |first1=Johnny |last2=Wright |first2=Stephanie L. |last3=Dris |first3=Rachid |last4=Collard |first4=France |last5=Mandin |first5=Corinne |last6=Guerrouache |first6=Mohamed |last7=Langlois |first7=Valérie |last8=Kelly |first8=Frank J. |last9=Tassin |first9=Bruno }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study looked at microplastic in the street dust of Tehran Iran and found 2649 particles of microplastic within ten samples of street dust, with ranging samples concentrations from 83 particle – 605 particles (+/- 10) per 30.0 g of street dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11356-017-9674-1 |pmid=28707239 |title=Microplastic pollution in deposited urban dust, Tehran metropolis, Iran |journal=Environmental Science and Pollution Research |volume=24 |issue=25 |pages=20360–20371 |year=2017 |last1=Dehghani |first1=Sharareh |last2=Moore |first2=Farid |last3=Akhbarizadeh |first3=Razegheh }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, much like freshwater ecosystems and soil, more studies are needed to understand the full impact and significance of airborne microplastics.

== Proposed solutions ==
Some researchers have proposed incinerating plastics to use as energy, which is known as energy recovery. As opposed to losing the energy from plastics into the atmosphere in [[Landfill|landfills]], this process turns some of the plastics back into energy that can be used. However, as opposed to recycling, this method does not diminish the amount of plastic material that is produced. Therefore, recycling plastics is considered a more efficient solution.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Increasing education through recycling campaigns is another proposed solution for microplastic contamination. While this would be a smaller scale solution, education has been shown to reduce littering, especially in urban environments where there are often large concentrations of plastic waste.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; If recycling efforts are increased, a cycle of plastic use and reuse would be created to decrease our waste output and production of new raw materials. In order to achieve this, states would need to employ stronger infrastructure and investment around recycling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kershaw|first=Peter J.|date=2016|title=Marine Plastic Debris and Microplastics|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/marine/good-environmental-status/descriptor-10/pdf/Marine_plastic_debris_and_microplastic_technical_report_advance_copy.pdf|dead-url=No|journal=[[United Nations Environment Programme]]|volume=|pages=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011052123/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/marine/good-environmental-status/descriptor-10/pdf/Marine_plastic_debris_and_microplastic_technical_report_advance_copy.pdf|archive-date=11 October 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some advocate for improving recycling technology to be able to recycle smaller plastics to reduce the need for production of new plastics.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Biodegradation is another possible solution to large amounts of microplastic waste. In this process, microorganisms consume and decompose synthetic polymers with using degrading enzymes.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Auta|first=H.S.|last2=Emenike|first2=C.U|last3=Fauziah|first3=S.H|date=May 2017|title=Distribution and importance of microplastics in the marine environment: A review of the sources, fate, effects, and potential solutions|url=|journal=[[Environment International]]|volume=102|pages=165–176|doi=10.1016/j.envint.2017.02.013|pmid=28284818|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plastics can then be used in the form of energy and as a source of [[carbon]] once broken down. The microbes could potentially be used to treat sewage wastewater, which would decrease the amount of microplastics that pass through into the surrounding environments.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==Policy and legislation==
With increasing awareness of the detrimental effects of microplastics on the environment, groups are now advocating for the removal and ban of microplastics from various products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2018.10.001 |title=Reducing marine pollution from single-use plastics (SUPs): A review |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=137 |pages=157–171 |year=2018 |last1=Schnurr |first1=Riley E.J. |last2=Alboiu |first2=Vanessa |last3=Chaudhary |first3=Meenakshi |last4=Corbett |first4=Roan A. |last5=Quanz |first5=Meaghan E. |last6=Sankar |first6=Karthikeshwar |last7=Srain |first7=Harveer S. |last8=Thavarajah |first8=Venukasan |last9=Xanthos |first9=Dirk |last10=Walker |first10=Tony R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; One such campaign is "Beat the Microbead", which focuses on removing plastics from personal care products.&lt;ref name = "BeattheMicrobead" /&gt; The Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation run the Global Microplastics Initiative, a project to collect water samples to provide scientists with better data about microplastic dispersion in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Microplastics Initiative|url=http://www.adventurescientists.org/microplastics.html|publisher=Adventure Scientists|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNESCO]] has sponsored research and global assessment programs due to the trans-boundary issue that microplastic pollution constitutes.&lt;ref name="GreenFacts"&gt;Morris and Chapman: "Marine Litter", "Green Facts: Facts on Health and the Environment", 2001-2015&lt;/ref&gt; These environmental groups will keep pressuring companies to remove plastics from their products in order to maintain healthy ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Philip: "'Microplastics' In Great Lakes Pose 'Very Real Threat' To Humans and Animals", International Business Times, 29 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

;United States

In the US, some states have taken action to mitigate the negative environmental effects of microplastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2017.02.048 |pmid=28238328 |title=International policies to reduce plastic marine pollution from single-use plastics (plastic bags and microbeads): A review |journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin |volume=118 |issue=1–2 |pages=17–26 |year=2017 |last1=Xanthos |first1=Dirk |last2=Walker |first2=Tony R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Illinois was the first US state to ban cosmetics containing microplastics.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; On the national level, the [[Microbead-Free Waters Act 2015]] was enacted after being signed by President [[Barack Obama]] on December 28, 2015. The law bans "rinse-off" cosmetic products that perform an exfoliating function, such as toothpaste or face wash. It does not apply to other products such as household cleaners. The act took effect on July 1, 2017, with respect to manufacturing, and July 1, 2018, with respect to introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce.&lt;ref name="PL114-114"&gt;United States. Microbead-Free Waters Act of 2015. {{uspl|114|114}}. Approved 2015-12-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25th, 2018, a microplastic reduction amendment was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/senate-bill/756/text|title=Text - S.756 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): Save Our Seas Act of 2018|last=Dan|first=Sullivan|date=2018-07-26|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation, as part of the Save Our Seas Act designed to combat marine pollution, aims to support the [[NOAA]]'s Marine Debris Program. In particular, the amendment is geared towards promoting NOAA’s Great Lakes Land-Based Marine Debris Action Plan to increase testing, cleanup, and education around plastic pollution in the Great Lakes.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; President [[Donald Trump]] signed the re-authorization and amendment bill into effect on October 11, 2018.

'''Japan'''

On June 15th, 2018, the Japanese government passed a bill with the goal of reducing microplastic production and pollution, especially in aquatic environments.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/06/15/national/bill-reduce-microplastics-released-environment-passed-japans-upper-house/|title=Bill to reduce microplastics released into the environment passed by Japan’s Upper House|last=|first=|date=15 June 2018|work=[[The Japan Times]]|access-date=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed by the Environment Ministry and passed unanimously by the Upper House, this is also the first bill to pass in Japan that is specifically targeted at reducing microplastic production, specifically in the personal care industry with products such as face wash and toothpaste.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This law is revised from previous legislation, which focused on removing plastic marine debris. It also focuses on increasing education and public awareness surrounding recycling and plastic waste.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The Environment Ministry has also proposed a number of recommendations for methods to monitor microplastic quantities in the ocean (Recommendations, 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 2018|title=Recommendations by Experts on the Required Parameters for Microplastics Monitoring in the Ocean|url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/water/marine_litter/pdf/recommendation.pdf|journal=Ministry of Environment, Japan|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the legislation does not specify any penalties for those who continue manufacturing products with microplastics.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

'''United Kingdom'''

The "Environmental Protection (Microbeads) (England) Regulations 2017" law from passed by the UK government bans the production of any rinse-off personal care products (such as exfoliants) containing microbeads.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017|title=The Environmental Protection (Microbeads) (England) Regulations 2017|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2017/1312/pdfs/uksi_20171312_en.pdf|journal=Cabinet of the United Kingdom|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This particular law denotes specific penalties when it is not obeyed. Those who do not comply are required to pay a fine. In the event that a fine is not paid, product manufacturers may receive a stop notice, which prevents the manufacturer from continuing production until they have followed regulation preventing the use of microbeads. Criminal proceedings may occur if the stop notice is ignored.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

== Action for creating awareness ==
On April 11, 2013 in order to create awareness, artist [[Maria Cristina Finucci]] founded The [[Garbage patch state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/venice/about-this-office/single-view/news/the_garbage_patch_territory_turns_into_a_new_state/#.U71u8fl_u9U|title=The garbage patch territory turns into a new state

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) launched its "Trash-Free Waters" initiative in 2013 to prevent single-use plastic wastes from ending up in waterways and ultimately the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deq.virginia.gov/Portals/0/DEQ/CoastalZoneManagement/EPA_Trash_Free_Waters_Program_Virginia_Marine_Debris_Summit_2013.pdf |title=EPA National Trash Free Waters Program |last1=Benson |first1=Bob |last2=Weiler |first2=Katherine |last3=Crawford |first3=Cara |date=2013-02-27 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.|id=Presentation at Virginia Marine Debris Summit, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA collaborates with the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]–Caribbean Environment Programme (UNEP-CEP) and the [[Peace Corps]] to reduce and also remove trash in the [[Caribbean Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/trash-free-waters/international-initiatives-address-marine-debris |title=International Initiatives to Address Marine Debris |date=2018-04-18 |website=Trash-Free Waters |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPA has also funded various projects in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] including one that is aimed at reducing the use of single-use plastics such as disposable cups, spoons and straws, from three [[University of California]] campuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/trash-free-waters/trash-free-waters-projects |title=Trash-Free Waters Projects |date=2017-09-27 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there are many organizations advocating action to counter microplastics and that is spreading microplastic awareness. One such group is the Florida Microplastic Awareness Project (FMAP), a group of volunteers who search for microplastics in coastal water samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sfyl.ifas.ufl.edu/flagler/marine-and-coastal/microplastics/|title=Microplastics  - UF/IFAS Extension|last=Communications|first=IFAS|website=sfyl.ifas.ufl.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cleanup ==

The field of [[music education]] contains a number of [[Learning theory (education)|learning theories]] that specify how students learn music based on behavioral and [[cognitive psychology]].&lt;ref name="Taetle 279"&gt;Laurie Taetle and Robert Cutietta, ''Learning Theories as Roots of Current Musical Practice and Research'', 279. [http://www.posgrado.unam.mx/musica/lecturas/educacion/Learning%20theories.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical Learning Theory==
While formal music education has roots going at least as far back as the Hebrews in Egypt&lt;ref name = "Mark and Gary 2007, 5"&gt;Michael L. Mark and Charles L. Gary, ''A History of American Music Education, Third Edition'' (2007: New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  or the ancient Greeks,&lt;ref name = "Mark and Gary 2007, 9"&gt;Michael L. Mark and Charles L. Gary, ''A History of American Music Education, Third Edition'' (2007: New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; challenges arose as music became more specialized and technically complex after the 5th century BCE in Ancient Greece and as the development of notation shifted music education from training in singing to training in music reading.&lt;ref name = "Mark and Gary 2007, 24-25"&gt;Michael L. Mark and Charles L. Gary, ''A History of American Music Education, Third Edition'' (2007: New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education), 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Educators and theorists such as [[Odo of Cluny]] and [[Guido of Arezzo|Guido d'Arezzo]] in the  10th and 11th centuries explored methods to teach these new developing notational practices.&lt;ref name = "Mark and Gary 2007, 24-25"/&gt; Academic interest in music education lessened by the [[Renaissance]] as universities abandoned music as a part of their curriculum in the mid 16th century,&lt;ref name = "Mark and Gary 2007, 29-30"&gt;Michael L. Mark and Charles L. Gary, ''A History of American Music Education, Third Edition'' (2007: New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education), 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Protestant Reformation]] later brought some changes to music education, [[Martin Luther]] among other individuals suggesting that music, poetry, and history be added to standard education curriculum.&lt;ref name = "Mark and Gary 2007, 32"&gt;Michael L. Mark and Charles L. Gary, ''A History of American Music Education, Third Edition'' (2007: New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, [[John Amos Comenius]] recommended music education for religious purposes and designed a methodology to do so, as [[Richard Mulcaster]] encouraged universal education including singing and playing as standard curriculum.&lt;ref name = "Mark and Gary 2007, 34-36"&gt;Michael L. Mark and Charles L. Gary, ''A History of American Music Education, Third Edition'' (2007: New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education), 34-36.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th century the conservatory model became more common outside of Italy alongside a number of choir schools which provided education as well as practical music experience.&lt;ref name = "Mark and Gary 2007, 38"&gt;Michael L. Mark and Charles L. Gary, ''A History of American Music Education, Third Edition'' (2007: New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==

Mainstream pedagogy and examination of how students learn theory rose to prominence in the 20th century by theorists and educators beginning with [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]], [[Zoltán Kodály]], and [[Carl Orff]], and followed by [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Shinichi Suzuki]], [[Edwin Gordon]], and [[Valeri Brainin]] among others. Later research into [[learning theory (education)|educational learning theories]] in the 1960s places emphasis on [[Behaviorism|behavioral]], [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitive]], and [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist]] thinking.&lt;ref name="Taetle 280"&gt;Laurie Taetle and Robert Cutietta, ''Learning Theories as Roots of Current Musical Practice and Research'', 280. [http://www.posgrado.unam.mx/musica/lecturas/educacion/Learning%20theories.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tanglewood Symposium]] of 1967 and the [[Music Educators National Conference]] Goals and Objective Project in 1969 were other early examples of the growing movement of applying modern developments in sequencing curriculum.&lt;ref name = "Taetle 280"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mark"&gt;Mark, M. Contemporary music education (2nd ed.) (New York: Schirmer Books, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavioral learning theories and music education===

[[Behaviorism]] examines relationships between the environment and the individual with roots in early 20th century work in the German experimental school.&lt;ref name = "Dierking 1991"&gt;Lynn Dierking, "Learning Theory and Learning Styles: An Overview," ''The Journal of Museum Education'' Vol. 16, No. 1 (1991): 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Theories by researchers such as [[Ivan Pavlov]] (who introduced [[classical conditioning]]), and [[B.F. Skinner]] ([[operant conditioning]]) looked at how environmental stimulation could impact learning, theorists building on these concepts to make applications to music learning. The research of [[Clifford Madsen]], [[Robert Duke]], [[Harry Price]], and [[Cornelia Yarbrough]] build on the operant conditioning model focusing on guiding "good" or "successful" teaching by analyzing the role of appropriate reinforcement such as praise and feedback on musical discrimination, attitude, and performance.&lt;ref name = "Taetle 281"&gt;Laurie Taetle and Robert Cutietta, ''Learning Theories as Roots of Current Musical Practice and Research'', 281. [http://www.posgrado.unam.mx/musica/lecturas/educacion/Learning%20theories.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Later studies also examined music itself as a mechanism of reinforcement, such as research by Greer (1981) and Madsen (1981).&lt;ref name = "Taetle 281"/&gt;

===Cognitive learning theories and music education===

[[Cognitivism (psychology)|Cognitive theories of learning]], often viewed as the antithesis of behavioral theories,&lt;ref name = "Taetle 282"&gt;Laurie Taetle and Robert Cutietta, ''Learning Theories as Roots of Current Musical Practice and Research'', 282. [http://www.posgrado.unam.mx/musica/lecturas/educacion/Learning%20theories.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; attempt to map how individual learning processes relate to already-familiar knowledge.&lt;ref name ="Taetle 282"/&gt; [[Gestalt psychology]] serves as the foundation for many applications to music learning theory.

[[Fred Lerdahl]] and [[Ray Jackendoff]] (1983) theorized on musical grammar based on Chomsky's linguistic theories, arguing that "acoustic information triggers mental operations that impose order onto input. If there is sufficient exposure to music, musical understanding will occur through enculturation rather than formal training."&lt;ref name = "Taetle 283"&gt;Laurie Taetle and Robert Cutietta, ''Learning Theories as Roots of Current Musical Practice and Research'', 283. [http://www.posgrado.unam.mx/musica/lecturas/educacion/Learning%20theories.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other cognitive learning theories are also based on research in [[early childhood education]], [[motor learning]], [[lateralization of brain function|hemispheric dominance]], and [[information theory]].&lt;ref name = "Taetle 284"&gt;Laurie Taetle and Robert Cutietta, ''Learning Theories as Roots of Current Musical Practice and Research'', 284. [http://www.posgrado.unam.mx/musica/lecturas/educacion/Learning%20theories.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructivist learning theories and music education===

[[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|Constructivist theories of learning]], largely developed by [[Jean Piaget]],&lt;ref name = "Glasersfeld 1990"&gt;Ernst von Glasersfeld, "An Exposition of Constructivism: Why Some Like It Radical". ''Journal for Research In Mathematics Education,'' Monograph 4, (1990): 19–29 &amp; 195–210. ISSN 0883-9530. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/749910]&lt;/ref&gt; accept the relation between the individual and the environment as crucial for understanding the process of learning in a more holistic perspective than cognitive and behavioral models.&lt;ref name = "Taetle 284"/&gt; [[Kurt Lewin]], also considered the 'father' of social psychology, used Gestalt theory to develop his [[field theory (psychology)|field theory]]
of learning, a model that emphasizes "context familiarity as an important descriptor of how individuals learn and process information."&lt;ref name = "Taetle 284-285"&gt;Laurie Taetle and Robert Cutietta, ''Learning Theories as Roots of Current Musical Practice and Research'', 284–285. [http://www.posgrado.unam.mx/musica/lecturas/educacion/Learning%20theories.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern constructivist applications to music education include research by Roger A. Rideout, Stephen P. Paul, Geraint Wiggins and others.&lt;ref name = "Taetle 285"&gt;Laurie Taetle and Robert Cutietta, ''Learning Theories as Roots of Current Musical Practice and Research'', 285. [http://www.posgrado.unam.mx/musica/lecturas/educacion/Learning%20theories.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sound Before Sight==
Contemporary music pedagogies emphasize ''sound before sight'', or the idea that in order to develop an understanding of music and music notation, individuals must first become comfortable with listening to, singing, and performing tonal and rhythm patterns before reading and writing music.&lt;ref name = "Dettwiler 1989"&gt;Peggy Dettwiler, "Developing Aural Skills Through Vocal Warm-Ups: Historical Approach of Pedagogical Approaches and Applications for Choral Directors," ''The Choral Journal,'' Vol. 30, No. 3 (1989): 13-15, 17-20. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/23547783]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hammel 2006"&gt;Alice M. Hammel, "Review Work: The Development and Practical Application of Music Learning Theory by Maria Runfola, Cynthia Crump Taggart," ''Music Educators Journal,'' Vol. 92, No. 5 (2006): 22-23.

''Bulletin of the Council for Research in Music Education,'' No. 184 (2010): 49-64. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27861482]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern studies by Luce (1965), McPherson (1993, 1995, 2005), and Bernhard (2004) all suggest a significant positive correlation with playing by ear and the ability to sight read,&lt;ref name = "Musco 2010, 53-54"&gt;Ann Marie Musco, "Playing by Ear: Is Expert Opinion Supported by Research?" ''Bulletin of the Council for Research in Music Education,'' No. 184 (2010): 54-54. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27861482]&lt;/ref&gt; and experimental research by Haston (2004) and Musco (2006) also suggest that spending classroom time playing by ear does not negatively impact students' abilities to develop music reading skills.&lt;ref name = "Musco 2010, 57-58"&gt;Ann Marie Musco, "Playing by Ear: Is Expert Opinion Supported by Research?"

[[File:Newtons cradle animation book 2.gif|thumb|upright=1.35|The cradle in [[Motion (physics)|motion]]]]
'''Newton’s cradle''' is a device that demonstrates [[conservation of momentum]] and [[conservation of energy|energy]] using a series of swinging spheres. When one sphere at the end is lifted and released, it strikes the stationary spheres, transmitting a force through the stationary spheres that pushes the last sphere upward. The last sphere swings back and strikes the still nearly stationary spheres, repeating the effect in the opposite direction. The device is named after 17th-century English scientist Sir [[Isaac Newton]]. It is also known as '''Newton's balls''' or '''Executive Ball Clicker'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sciencedemonstrations.fas.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k16940&amp;tabgroupid=icb.tabgroup19784/NewtonsCradle/NewtonsCradle.html |title=Sciencedemonstrations.fas.harvard.eu |publisher=Sciencedemonstrations.fas.harvard.edu |accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hendrix2.uoregon.edu/~demo/Demo/Mechanics/ILM/Balls.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720095258/http://hendrix2.uoregon.edu/~demo/Demo/Mechanics/ILM/Balls.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 July 2011 |title=Hendrix2.uoregon.edu |publisher=Hendrix2.uoregon.edu |accessdate=3 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu/~flanderb/files/Newton.htm |title=claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu |publisher=claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu |accessdate=3 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928170526/http://claymore.engineer.gvsu.edu/~flanderb/files/Newton.htm |archivedate=28 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://demo.pa.msu.edu/showdemo.asp?DID=DID26 |title=Demo.pa.mus.edu |publisher=Demo.pa.msu.edu |accessdate=3 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110814121658/http://demo.pa.msu.edu/showdemo.asp?DID=DID26 |archivedate=14 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Newton’s Cradle 1 Jan 18.jpg|thumb|A 5-ball newton's cradle]]
A typical Newton's cradle consists of a series of identically sized metal balls suspended in a metal frame so that they are just touching each other at rest. Each ball is attached to the frame by two wires of equal length angled away from each other. This restricts the [[pendulum]]s' movements to the same plane.

==Operation==
[[File:Newton’s cradle slo mo.webm|thumb|Newton's cradle in [[slow motion]].]]
When one of the end balls ("the first") is pulled sideways, the attached string makes it follow an upward arc. When it is let go, it strikes the second ball and comes to nearly a dead stop. The ball on the opposite side acquires most of the velocity of the first ball and swings in an arc almost as high as the release height of the first ball.  This shows that the last ball receives most of the energy and momentum of the first ball. The impact produces a compression wave that propagates through the intermediate balls. Any efficiently elastic material such as steel does this, as long as the kinetic energy is temporarily stored as potential energy in the compression of the material rather than being lost as heat. There are slight movements in all the balls after the initial strike but the last ball receives most of the initial energy from the drop of the first ball. When two (or three) balls are dropped, the two (or three) balls on the opposite side swing out. Some say that this behavior demonstrates the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy in elastic collisions. However, if the colliding balls behave as described above with the same mass possessing the same velocity before and after the collisions, then any function of mass and velocity is conserved in such an event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gauld|first1=Colin F.|title=Newton’s Cradle in Physics Education|journal=Science &amp; Education|date=August 2006|volume=15|issue=6|pages=597–617|doi=10.1007/s11191-005-4785-3|bibcode=2006Sc&amp;Ed..15..597G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physics explanation==
[[File:Newton's Cradle 2 ball cropped.gif|thumb|Newton's cradle with two balls of equal weight and perfectly efficient elasticity. The left ball is pulled away and let go. Neglecting the energy losses, the left ball strikes the right ball, transferring all the velocity to the right ball. Because they are the same weight, the same velocity indicates all the momentum and energy are also transferred. The kinetic energy, as determined by the velocity, is converted to potential energy as it reaches the same height as the initial ball and the cycle repeats.]]
[[File:Newtons cradle 5 ball system cropped.gif|thumb|An idealized Newton's cradle with five balls when there are no energy losses and there is always a small separation between the balls, except for when a pair is colliding.]]
[[File:Newtons cradle 3 ball swing 5 ball system cropped.gif|thumb|Newton's cradle three-ball swing in a five-ball system. The central ball swings without any apparent interruption.]]
Newton's cradle can be modeled with simple physics and minor errors if you incorrectly assume the balls always collide in pairs. If one ball strikes four stationary balls that are already touching, the simplification can't explain the resulting movements in all five balls, which are not due to friction losses. For example, in a real Newton's cradle the fourth has some movement and the first ball has a slight reverse movement. All the animations in this article show idealized action (simple solution) that only occurs if the balls are '''not''' touching initially and only collide in pairs.

===Simple solution===
The conservation of momentum (mass&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;velocity) and kinetic energy (0.5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;mass&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;velocity^2) can be used to find the resulting velocities for [[elastic collision|two colliding perfectly elastic objects]].  These two equations are used to determine the resulting velocities of the two objects. For the case of two balls constrained to a straight path by the strings in the cradle, the velocities are a single number instead of a 3D vector for 3D space, so the math requires only two equations to solve for two unknowns.  When the two objects weigh the same, the solution is simple: the moving object stops relative to the stationary one and the stationary one picks up all the other's initial velocity. This assumes perfectly elastic objects, so we do not need to account for heat and sound energy losses.

Steel does not compress much, but its elasticity is very efficient, so it does not cause much [[waste heat]]. The simple effect from two same-weight efficiently elastic colliding objects constrained to a straight path is the basis of the interesting effect seen in the cradle, and gives an approximate solution to all its action.

For a sequence of same-weight elastic objects constrained to a straight path, the effect continues to each successive object. For example, when two balls are dropped to strike three stationary balls in a cradle, there is an unnoticed but crucial small distance between the two dropped balls, and the action is as follows: The first moving ball that strikes the first stationary ball (the second ball striking the third ball) transfers all its velocity to the third ball and stops. The third ball then transfers the velocity to the fourth ball and stops, and then the fourth to the fifth ball. Right behind this sequence is the first ball transferring its velocity to the second ball that just stopped, and the sequence repeats immediately and imperceptibly behind the first sequence, ejecting the fourth ball right behind the fifth ball with the same small separation that was between the two initial striking balls.  If they are simply touching when they strike the third ball, precision requires the more complete solution below.

====Other examples of this effect====
The interesting effect of the last ball ejecting with a velocity nearly equal to the first ball can be seen in sliding a coin on a table into a line of identical coins, as long as the striking coin and its twin targets are in a straight line.  The effect can similarly be seen in billiard balls. The effect can also be seen when a sharp and strong pressure wave strikes a dense homogeneous material immersed in a less-dense medium.  If the identical atoms, molecules, or larger-scale sub-volumes of the dense homogeneous material are at least partially elastically connected to each other by electrostatic forces, they can act like a sequence of colliding identical elastic balls. The surrounding atoms, molecules, or sub-volumes experiencing the pressure wave act to constrain each other similarly to how the string constrains the cradle's balls to a straight line. For example, [[lithotripsy]] shock waves can be sent through the skin and tissue without harm to burst [[Kidney stone disease|kidney stones]]. The side of the stones opposite to the incoming pressure wave bursts, not the side receiving the initial strike.

====When the simple solution applies====
For the simple solution to precisely predict the action, no pair in the midst of colliding may touch a third ball, because the presence of the third ball effectively makes the struck ball appear heavier. Applying the two conservation equations to solve the final velocities of three or more balls in a single collision results in many possible solutions, so these two principles are not enough to determine resulting action.

Even when there is a small initial separation, a third ball may become involved in the collision if the initial separation is not large enough. When this occurs, the complete solution method described below must be used.

Small steel balls work well because they remain efficiently elastic with little heat loss under strong strikes and do not compress much (up to about 30&amp;nbsp;µm in a small Newton's cradle). The small, stiff compressions mean they occur rapidly, less than 200 microseconds, so steel balls are more likely to complete a collision before touching a nearby third ball. Softer elastic balls require a larger separation to maximize the effect from pair-wise collisions.

===More complete solution===
[[File:Newton Cradle 5 ball system in 3D 2 ball swing.gif|thumb|Newton's cradle five-ball system in 3D two-ball swing]]
A cradle that best follows the simple solution needs to have an initial separation between the balls that is at least twice the distance that the surface of balls compresses, but most do not. This section describes the action when the initial separation is not enough and in subsequent collisions that involve more than 2 balls even when there is an initial separation. This solution simplifies to the simple solution when only 2 balls touch during a collision. It applies to all perfectly elastic identical balls that have no energy losses due to friction and can be approximated by materials such as steel, glass, plastic, and rubber.

For two balls colliding, only the two equations for conservation of momentum and energy are needed to solve the two unknown resulting velocities. For three or more simultaneously colliding elastic balls, the relative compressibilities of the colliding surfaces are the additional variables that determine the outcome. For example, five balls have four colliding points and scaling (dividing) three of them by the fourth gives the three extra variables needed to solve for all five post-collision velocities.

Newtonian, Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, and stationary action are the different ways of mathematically expressing classical mechanics. They describe the same physics, but must be solved by different methods. All enforce the conservation of energy and momentum. Newton's law has been used in research papers. It is applied to each ball and the sum of forces is made equal to zero. So there are five equations, one for each ball—and five unknowns, one for each velocity. If the balls are identical, the absolute compressibility of the surfaces becomes irrelevant, because it can be divided out of both sides of all five equations, producing zero.

Most materials like steel that are efficiently elastic approximately follow Hooke's force law for springs, &lt;math&gt;F=k\cdot x&lt;/math&gt;, but because the area of contact for a sphere increases as the force increases, colliding elastic balls follow Hertz's adjustment to Hooke's law, &lt;math&gt;\ F=k\cdot x^{1.5}&lt;/math&gt;. This and Newton's law for motion (&lt;math&gt;F=m\cdot a&lt;/math&gt;) are applied to each ball, giving five simple but interdependent differential equations that are solved numerically. When the fifth ball begins accelerating, it is receiving momentum and energy from the third and fourth balls through the spring action of their compressed surfaces. For identical elastic balls of any type with initially touching balls the action is the same for the first strike, except the time to complete a collision increases in softer materials. 40% to 50% of the kinetic energy of the initial ball from a single-ball strike is stored in the ball surfaces as potential energy for most of the collision process. 13% of the initial velocity is imparted to the fourth ball (which can be seen as a 3.3 degree movement if the fifth ball moves out 25 degrees) and there is a slight reverse velocity in the first three balls, the first ball having the largest at −7% of the initial velocity. This separates the balls, but they come back together just before as the fifth ball returns. This is due to the pendulum phenomenon of different small angle disturbances having approximately the same time to return to the center. When balls are "touching" in subsequent collisions is complex, but still determinable by this method, especially if friction losses is included and the pendulum timing is calculated exactly instead of relying on the small angle approximation.

The differential equations with the initial separations are needed if there is less than 10&amp;nbsp;µm separation (less than width of a human hair) when using 100 gram steel balls with an initial 1&amp;nbsp;m/s strike speed.

The Hertzian differential equations predict that if two balls strike three, the fifth and fourth balls will leave with velocities of 1.14 and 0.80 times the initial velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/hinch/publications/PRSLA455_3201.pdf |title=The fragmentation of a line of balls by an impact |first1=E.J. |last1=Hinch |first2=S. |last2=Saint-Jean |journal=Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A |year=1999 |volume=455 |pages=3201–3220}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is 2.03 times more kinetic energy in the fifth ball than the fourth ball, which means the fifth ball would swing twice as high in the vertically direction as the fourth ball.  But in a real Newton's cradle the fourth ball swings out as far as the fifth ball. To explain the difference between theory and experiment, the two striking balls must have at least ≈10&amp;nbsp;µm separation (given steel, 100&amp;nbsp;g, and 1&amp;nbsp;m/s). This shows that in the common case of steel balls, unnoticed separations can be important and must be included in the Hertzian differential equations, or the simple solution gives a more accurate result.

===Effect of pressure waves===
The forces in the Hertzian solution above were assumed to propagate in the balls immediately, which is not the case. Sudden changes in the force between the atoms of a material builds up to form a pressure wave.  Pressure waves (aka sound) in steel travel about 5&amp;nbsp;cm in 10 microseconds, which is about 10 times faster than the time between the first ball striking and the last ball being ejected. The pressure waves reflect back and forth through all 5 balls about 10 times, although dispersing to less of a wave front with more reflections.  This is fast enough for the Hertzian solution to not require a substantial modification to adjust for the delay in force propagation through the balls. In less-rigid but still very elastic balls such as rubber, the propagation speed is slower, but the duration of collisions is longer, so the Hertzian solution still applies. The error introduced by the limited speed of the force propagation biases the Hertzian solution towards the simple solution because the collisions are not affected as much by the inertia of the balls that are further away.

Identically-shaped balls help the pressure waves converge on the contact point of the last ball: at the initial strike point one pressure wave goes forward to the other balls while another goes backwards to reflect off the opposite side of the first ball, and then it follows the first wave, being exactly 1 ball-diameter behind. The two waves meet up at the last contact point because the first wave reflects off the opposite side of the last ball and it meets up at the last contact point with the second wave. Then they reverberate back and forth like this about 10 times until the first ball stops connecting with the second ball. Then the reverberations reflect off the contact point between the second and third balls, but still converge at the last contact point, until the last ball is ejected—but it's less of a wave front with each reflection.

===Effect of different types of balls===
Using different types of material does not change the action as long as the material is efficiently elastic.  The size of the spheres doesn't change the results unless the increased weight exceeds the elastic limit of the material. If the solid balls are too large, is be lost as heat, because the elastic limit increases as radius&lt;sup&gt;1.5&lt;/sup&gt; but the energy had to be absorbed and released increases as radius&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  Making the contact surfaces flatter can overcome this to an extent by distributing the compression to a larger amount of material but it can introduce an alignment problem. Steel is better than most materials because it allows the simple solution to apply more often in collisions after the first strike, its elastic range for storing energy remains good despite the higher energy caused by its weight, and the higher weight decreases the effect of air resistance.

===Heat and friction losses===
This discussion has neglected energy losses from heat generated in the balls from non-perfect elasticity, friction in the strings, friction from air resistance, and sound generated from the clank of the vibrating balls. The energy losses are the reason the balls eventually come to a stop, but they are not the primary or initial cause of the action to become more disorderly, away from the ideal action of only one ball moving at any instant. The increase in the non-ideal action is caused by collisions that involve more than two balls at a time, effectively making the struck ball appear heavier. The size of the steel balls is limited because the collisions may exceed the elastic limit of the steel, deforming it and causing heat losses.

==Applications==
The most common application is that of a desktop [[executive toy]]. Another use is as an educational physics demonstration, as an example of [[conservation of momentum]] and [[conservation of energy]].

A similar principle, the propagation of waves in solids, was used in the Constantinesco [[Synchronization gear]] system for propeller / gun synchronizers on early fighter aircraft.{{elucidate|date=May 2015}}

==History==
[[File:American Science and Surplus - Newton's Cradle.jpg|thumb|right|Large Newton's cradle at American Science and Surplus]]
[[Christiaan Huygens]] used pendulums to study collisions. His work, ''De Motu Corporum ex Percussione'' (On the Motion of Bodies by Collision) published posthumously in 1703, contains a version of [[Newton's first law]] and discusses the collision of suspended bodies including two bodies of equal mass with the motion of the moving body being transferred to the one at rest.

The principle demonstrated by the device, the law of impacts between bodies, was first demonstrated by the French [[physicist]] [[Edme Mariotte|Abbé Mariotte]] in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~scidemos/NewtonianMechanics/NewtonsCradle/NewtonsCradle.html|title= Harvard website page on Newton's Cradle|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Edme Mariotte]]&lt;/ref&gt; Newton acknowledged Mariotte's work, among that of others, in his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]''.

There is much confusion over the origins of the modern Newton's cradle. Marius J. Morin has been credited as being the first to name and make this popular [[executive toy]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} However, in early 1967, an English actor, [[Simon Prebble]], coined the name "Newton's cradle" (now used generically) for the wooden version manufactured by his company, Scientific Demonstrations Ltd.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} After some initial resistance from retailers, they were first sold by [[Harrods]] of London, thus creating the start of an enduring market for executive toys.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Later a very successful chrome design for the Carnaby Street store Gear was created by the sculptor and future film director [[Richard Loncraine]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The largest cradle device in the world was designed by ''[[MythBusters]]'' and consisted of five one-ton concrete and steel [[rebar]]-filled buoys suspended from a steel truss.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb episode|2074856|Newton's Crane Cradle (5 October 2011)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buoys also had a steel plate inserted in between their two halves to act as a "contact point" for transferring the energy; this cradle device did not function well because concrete is not elastic so most of the energy was lost to a heat buildup in the concrete. A smaller scale version constructed by them consists of five {{Convert|6|inch|cm|adj=mid}} chrome steel ball bearings, each weighing {{convert|33|lb|kg}}, and is nearly as efficient as a desktop model.

The cradle device with the largest diameter collision balls on public display was visible for more than a year in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], Wisconsin, at the retail store American Science and Surplus (see photo). Each ball was an inflatable exercise ball {{convert|26|in|cm}} in diameter (encased in steel rings), and was supported from the ceiling using extremely strong magnets. It was dismantled in early August 2010 due to maintenance concerns.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==In popular culture==
Newton's cradle has been used more than 20 times in movies,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/search/keyword?keywords=newton%27s-cradle Most Popular "Newton's Cradle" Titles - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; often as a [[Trope (literature)|trope]] on the desk of a lead villain such as Paul Newman's role in ''The Hudsucker Proxy'', Magneto in ''X-Men'', and the Kryptonians in ''Superman II''.  It was used to represent the unyielding position of the NFL towards head injuries in ''Concussion''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cinemaniacreviews.net/2015/12/31/review-concussion/ Concussion – Cinemaniac Reviews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211075312/https://cinemaniacreviews.net/2015/12/31/review-concussion/ |date=11 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used as a relaxing diversion on the desk of lead intelligent/anxious/sensitive characters such as Henry Winkler's role in ''Night Shift'', Dustin Hoffman's role in ''Straw Dogs'', and Gwyneth Paltrow's role in ''Iron Man 2''. It was featured more prominently as a series of clay pots in ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]'', and as a row of 1968 [[Eero Aarnio]] bubble chairs with scantily-clad women in them in ''Gamer''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stylessentials.com/?p=385 13 Icons of Modern Design in Movies « Style Essentials&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Storks (film)|Storks]]'', Hunter the CEO of Cornerstore has one not with balls, but with little birds.

In 2017, an episode of the ''Omnibus'' [[podcast]], featuring ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' champion [[Ken Jennings]] and musician [[John Roderick (musician)|John Roderick]], focused on the history of Newton's Cradle.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.omnibusproject.com/podcasts/newtons-cradle-entry-835-1c1311.htm  ''Omnibus'': Newton's Cradle (Entry 835.1C1311)]&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's cradle is also featured on the desk of Deputy White House Communications Director [[Sam Seaborn]] in ''[[The West Wing]]''.

Jefferson Airplane (1968) on the album "Crown of Creation" used the cradle as a rhythm device to create polyrhythms on an instrumental track.

[[File:SFParklet.jpg|thumb|right|A parklet on [[Valencia Street]] in [[San Francisco]].]] 
A '''parklet''' is a [[sidewalk]] extension that provides more space and amenities for people using the [[street]]. Usually parklets are installed on parking lanes and use several [[parking space]]s. Parklets typically extend out from the sidewalk at the level of the sidewalk to the width of the adjacent parking space.&lt;ref name=Parklet_Manual /&gt;&lt;ref name="Experimenting with the Margin" /&gt;

Parklets are intended for people. Parklets offer a place to stop, to sit, and to [[leisure|rest]] while taking in the activities of the street. In instances where a parklet is not intended to accommodate people, it may provide greenery, [[art]], or some other visual amenity. A parklet may accommodate [[bicycle parking]] within it, or bicycle parking may be associated with it.&lt;ref name="Experimenting with the Margin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Abad Ocubillo|first=Robin|title=Experimenting with the Margin: Parklets and Plazas as Catalysts in Community and Government|year=2012|publisher=University of Southern California|url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15799coll3/id/89034}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A parklet may be thought of as permanent, but must be designed for quick and easy removal for [[emergency|emergencies]] or other reasons such as [[snow removal]] without damage to the [[curb (road)|curb]] or street. As initially conceived, a parklet is always [[public accommodation|open to the public]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sfpavementtoparks.sfplanning.org |title=Pavement to Parks |publisher=Sfpavementtoparks.sfplanning.org |date= |accessdate=2013-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some cities have allowed restaurants to create parklets that are not open to the public such as Long Beach, California, Fargo, North Dakota and Montreal, Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Long Beach|title=Long Beach’s Very Own Retro Row is Home to the 1st Parklet in Southern California No. 9 Restaurant Also Participating in the City Pilot Program|url=http://www.longbeach.gov/news/displaynews.asp?NewsID=5648&amp;TargetID=55|work=City of Long Beach}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=UCLA Complete Streets Initiative|title=Reclaiming the Right-of-Way: A Toolkit for Creating and Implementing Parklets|year=2012|publisher=UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs|location=Los Angeles, CA|url=http://www.its.ucla.edu/research/parklettoolkit.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and purpose==
[[File:Парклет Івано-Франківськ 01.jpg|thumb|right|A parklet in [[Ivano-Frankivsk]].]]
Parklets are designed to provide a [[public place]] for passersby to relax and enjoy the atmosphere of the city around them, in places where either current [[urban park]]s are lacking or where the existing sidewalk width is not large enough to accommodate vibrant street life activities. Parklets can be designed to be either permanent fixtures, or can be designed to be temporary/seasonal in places where snow removal is a concern. Seasonal parklets are found in New York City, Philadelphia, and Chicago.&lt;ref name=Chicago&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Chicago|title=People Spots|url=http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/cdot/supp_info/make_way_for_people/people_spot.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Philadelphia&gt;{{cite web|last=Saffron|first=Inga|title=Transforming parking spots to parklets: Philadelphia joins an urban trend|url=http://articles.philly.com/2011-08-04/news/29850967_1_spaces-parklets-parking-spots}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cities choose to install these sites in order to create more public space by creating "places for people to sit, relax and enjoy the city."&lt;ref name=Van&gt;{{cite web|last=City of Vancouver, BC|title=Parklets: converting street parking spaces to mini plazas|url=https://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/parklets.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vancouver 2013 Parklet Pilot Program Guide explains parklets purpose and design as "benefit local businesses, residents, and visitors by providing unique public spaces that attract customers and foster community conversation. They can also have additional benefits such as adding more space for people to walk in congested areas. The typical design is a platform that extends the sidewalk and provides amenities like seats, tables, bike racks, and landscaping"&lt;ref name="Van"/&gt;

Parklets are typically spaces for passive recreation, The first parklets with active recreation were installed in Los Angeles, CA in February 2013. Two sites on Spring Street, in Downtown Los Angeles, each feature two exercise bicycles on site. Upon evaluation, 20% of people surveyed in the sites said they previously used the machines; but only 5% of activity observed recorded use of the machines. Active recreation use of parklets may need some additional motivation to increase use at the exercise machines.&lt;ref name=Eval&gt;{{cite web|last=UCLA Complete Streets Initiative &amp; Parklet Studies|title=Reclaiming the Right-of-Way: Evaluation Report|url=http://www.its.ucla.edu/research/parkletasessment.pdf|work=Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies|publisher=Luskin School of Public Affairs|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102182905/http://www.its.ucla.edu/research/parkletasessment.pdf|archivedate=2 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Parklet on the street in London has been installed in July 2015.

In April 2018, a Parklet was also created on [https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/pop-up-leeds-park-is-calling-for-the-summer-1-9131954 The Calls in Leeds], UK, as a result of a partnership between Leeds Business Improvement District (LeedsBID), Leeds City Council, and LAAND landscape architects.

[[Image:Pasquino 02.jpg|thumb|Modern pasquinades in Italian on the base of the statue]]
'''Pasquino''' or '''Pasquin''' ([[Latin]]: ''Pasquillus'') is the name used by [[Rome|Romans]] since the [[early modern period]] to describe a battered [[Hellenistic]]-style statue dating to the third century BC, which was unearthed in the [[Parione]] district of [[Rome]] in the fifteenth century. It is located in a piazza of the same name on the southwest corner of the [[Palazzo Braschi]] (Museo di Roma); near the site where it was unearthed.  The statue is known as the first of the [[talking statues of Rome]], because of the tradition of attaching anonymous criticisms to its base.

==History==
[[File:1-pasquino.jpg|thumb|Pasquino statue 2017. Postering on the statue is prohibited.  "Pasquinades" must be placed on a side board.]]
The statue's fame dates to the early sixteenth century, when Cardinal [[Oliviero Carafa]] draped the [[marble]] torso of the statue in a toga and decorated it with Latin [[epigram]]s on the occasion of [[Saint Mark]]'s Day.

The Cardinal's actions led to a custom of criticizing the pope or his government by the writing of [[Satire|satirical poems]] in broad [[Romanesco dialect|Roman dialect]]—called "pasquinades" from the Italian "pasquinate"—and attaching them to the statue "Pasquino".

Thus Pasquino became the first "talking statue" of Rome. He spoke out about the people's dissatisfaction, denounced injustice, and assaulted misgovernment by members of the Church. From this tradition are derived the English-language terms '''pasquinade''' and '''pasquil''', which refer to an anonymous [[parody|lampoon]] in verse or prose.&lt;ref&gt;In verse, the pasquinade finds a classical source in the [[epigram]]s of [[Martial]]: John W. Spaeth, Jr., "Martial and the Pasquinade" ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' '''70''' (1939:242-255).&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual subject of the sculpture is ''[[Menelaus supporting the body of Patroclus]]'', and the subject, or the composition applied to other figures as in the [[Sperlonga sculptures]], occurs a number of times in classical sculpture, where it is now known as a "[[Pasquino group]]".  The actual identification of the sculptural subject was made in the eighteenth century by the [[antiquarian]] [[Ennio Quirino Visconti]], who identified it as the torso of [[Menelaus]] supporting the dying [[Patroclus]]; the more famous of two Medici versions of this is in the [[Loggia dei Lanzi]] in [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], Italy.  The ''Pasquino'' is more recently characterized as a [[Hellenistic]] sculpture of the third century BC, or a Roman copy.&lt;ref&gt;Early discussion was summarised in B. Schweitzer and F. Hackenbeil, ''Das Original der sogennanten Pasquino-Gruppe'' (Leipzig: Hirtzl) 1936; the modern opinion is from [[Wolfgang Helbig]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymological origins==
[[File:Statue of Pasquin in the House of Cardinal Ursino MET DP870228.jpg|thumb|Pasquino in 1550 by [[Nicolas Béatrizet]]]]
The origin of the name, "Pasquino", remains obscure. By the mid-sixteenth century it was reported that the name "Pasquino" derived from a nearby tailor who was renowned for his wit and intellect;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Cq5PAAAAMAAJ Origin of Pasquino.]&lt;/ref&gt; speculation had it that his legacy was carried on through the statue, in "the honor and everlasting remembrance of the poor tailor".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Cq5PAAAAMAAJ Origin of Pasquino.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tradition of wit==
Before long, other statues appeared on the scene, forming a kind of public [[Salon (gathering)|salon]] or academy, the  "Congress of the Wits" (''Congresso degli Arguti''), with Pasquino always the leader, and the sculptures that Romans called [[Marphurius]], [[Abbot Luigi]], [[Il Facchino]], [[Madama Lucrezia]], and [[Il Babbuino]] as his outspoken colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Ponti 1927; ''Enciclopedia Italiana'', ''s.v.'' "Pasquino e Pasquinate".&lt;/ref&gt; The ''cartelli'' (translated as posters, placards, boards; probably the equivalent of pamphlet) on which the epigrams were written were quickly passed around, and copies were made, too numerous to suppress.&lt;ref&gt;Copies in private daybooks have preserved some that were too scurrilous to print.&lt;/ref&gt; These poems were collected and published annually by the Roman printer [[Giacomo Mazzocchi]] as early as 1509, as ''Carmina apposita Pasquino'', and became well known all over [[Europe]]. As they became more pointed, the place of publication of ''Pasquillorum Tomi Duo'' (1544) was shifted to [[Basel]],&lt;ref&gt;("Two volumes of Pasquinades"). ''Pasquillorum Tomi Duo. Quorum primo uersibus ac rhythmis, altero soluta oratione conscripta quamplurima continentur, ad exhilarandum, confirmandumque hoc perturbatissimo rerum statu pij lectoris animum'' (Johann Oporino, Eleutheropoli (sc. Basel) 1544) ([https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mtJNAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=contents#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false digitized])&lt;/ref&gt; less squarely under papal control, disguised on the titlepage as ''Eleutheropolis'', "freedom city".&lt;ref&gt;Spaeth 1939:245, identifies the editor as the humanist-turned-Protestant [[Caelius Secundus Curio]], an exile and professor of oratory at Basel, whose satirical dialogue ''Pasquillus Extaticus et [[Marforio|Marphorius]]'' appeared for the first time (in Latin) in this work (Part 2, pp. 426-529) and rapidly gained an independent life in translations into Italian, French, German, Dutch and, a little later, English.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parody|lampoon]]ing tradition was ancient among Romans. For a first-century versified lampoon, see [[Domus Aurea]].

''Pasquinade'' is sometimes misidentified, appearing among synonyms of ''[[parody]]'' at [[WordNet]]. Compare also the equally unrelated ''[[pastiche]]''.

==Cultural legacy==
In 1589 one of the contributors to the [[Marprelate Controversy]], a pamphlet war between the [[Established Church]] of England and its [[puritan]] opponents, adopted the pseudonym [[Pasquill (the Cavaliero)|Pasquill]]. At the end of his second pamphlet ''The Return of Pasquill'' (published in October 1589), Pasquill invites critics of his opponent [[Martin Marprelate]] to write out their complaints and post them up on [[London Stone]].

''Pasquin'' is the name of a play by [[Henry Fielding]] from 1736. It was a ''pasquinade'' in that it was an explicit and personalized attack on [[Robert Walpole]] and his supporters. It is one of the plays that triggered the [[Licensing Act of 1737|Theatrical Licensing Act of 1737]].

''The Pasquinade'' is a small, grassroots [[magazine]] of [[parody]] and [[satire]] started in the mid-1990s by Dallas Shelby, a college journalism student with a bent for satire and a love of [[popular culture|pop culture]]. In 2003, the organization developed its own film production company, Pasquinade Films.

''Anthony Pasquin'' is the pseudonym of [[John Williams (satirist)|John Williams]] (1761–1818) and his satirical writing of royalties, academicians, and actors.

''Pasquino'' was a pen name of [[J. Fairfax McLaughlin]] (1939–1903), American lawyer and author.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pseudonyms|author=Joseph F. Clarke|publisher=BCA|date=1977|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] term ''[[Pashkevil]]'' is the generic name of the posters put up on the walls of [[Ultra-Orthodox Jews]]ish enclaves in [[Israel]]. These posters define legitimate behavior, such as prohibitions on owning [[smart phones]], as well as often being the mouthpiece for radical anti-Zionist groups, such as the ''[[Neturei Karta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brother Against Brother: Violence and Extremism in Israeli Politics, E. Sprinzak, 1999, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pashkevillim'' take the place of conventional media in communities where they are shunned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="62612">'''Perceptual control theory''' ('''PCT''') is a model of [[behavior]] based on the principles of [[negative feedback]], but differing in important respects from [[Control theory|engineering control theory]]. Results of PCT experiments have demonstrated that an organism controls neither its own behavior, nor external environmental variables, but rather its own perceptions of those variables. Actions are not controlled, they are varied so as to cancel the effects that unpredictable environmental disturbances would otherwise have on controlled perceptions. As a catch-phrase of the field puts it, "behavior is the control of perception." PCT demonstrates circular causation in a negative feedback loop closed through the environment. This fundamentally contradicts the classical notion of linear causation of behavior by stimuli, in which environmental stimuli are thought to cause behavioral responses, mediated (according to [[cognitive psychology]]) by intervening cognitive processes.  &lt;sup&gt;[[citation needed]]&lt;/sup&gt;

Numerous computer simulations of specific behavioral situations demonstrate its efficacy,&lt;ref&gt;For example in [http://mindreadings.com/demos.htm this collection].&lt;/ref&gt; with extremely high correlations to observational data (0.95 or better), which are vanishingly rare in the so-called 'soft' sciences.&lt;ref name=Runkel.cast/&gt; While the adoption of PCT in the scientific community has not been widespread, it has been applied not only in [[experimental psychology]] and [[neuroscience]], but also in sociology, linguistics, and a number of other fields, and has led to a method of psychotherapy called the [[method of levels]].

==The place of purpose (intention) and causation in psychology==

A tradition from Aristotle through William James recognizes that behavior is ''purposeful'' rather than merely reactive. However, the only evidence for intentions was subjective. Behaviorists following [[Wilhelm Wundt|Wundt]], [[Edward Thorndike|Thorndyke]], [[John B. Watson|Watson]], and others rejected introspective reports as data for an objective science of psychology. Only observable behavior could be admitted as data.&lt;ref&gt;"The behaviorist asks: Why don't we make what we can observe the real field of psychology? Let us limit ourselves to things that can be observed, and formulate laws concerning only those things. Now what can we observe? We can observe behavior—what the organism does or says." Watson, J.B. (1924). ''Behaviorism''. New York: People's Institute Publishing Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

There follows from this stance the assumption that environmental events (stimuli) cause behavioral actions (responses). This assumption persists in [[cognitive psychology]], which interposes [[cognitive maps]] and other postulated [[information processing]] between stimulus and response, but otherwise retains the assumption of linear causation from environment to behavior.&lt;ref name=Marken2009rev&gt;{{cite journal | last =Marken | first =Richard S. | author-link = | title =You say you had a revolution: Methodological foundations of closed-loop psychology | journal =Review of General Psychology | volume =13 | issue =2 | pages =137–145 | publisher = | location = | date =June 2009 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi =10.1037/a0015106 | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, more specific reason for psychologists' rejecting notions of purpose or intention was that they could not see how a goal (a state that did not yet exist) could cause the behavior that led to it. PCT resolves these philosophical arguments about [[teleology]] because it provides a model of the functioning of organisms in which purpose has objective status without recourse to [[introspection]], and in which causation is circular around [[feedback loops]].&lt;ref name=Runkel-PLT&gt;{{cite book | last =Runkel | first =Philip J. | author-link = | title =People as living things | publisher =Living Control Systems Publishing | edition = | date =2003 | location =Hayward, CA | pages =  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =0-9740155-0-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

PCT has roots in insights of [[Claude Bernard]] and 20th century [[control systems engineering]] and [[cybernetics]]. It was originated as such, and given its present form and experimental methodology, by [[William T. Powers]].&lt;ref name=Runkel.cast&gt;{{cite book | last =Runkel | first =Philip J. | author-link = | title =Casting nets and testing specimens: Two grand methods of psychology | publisher =Praeger | edition = | date =1990 | location =New York | page =103 | isbn =0-275-93533-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cziko.TWD&gt;{{Citation | last =Cziko | first =Gary | author-link = | title =The things we do: Using the lessons of Bernard and Darwin to understand the what, how, and why of our behavior | place =Cambridge, MA | publisher =MIT Press | year =2000 | page =9 | isbn =0-262-03277-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powers recognized that to be purposeful implies control, and that the concepts and methods of engineered control systems could be applied to biological control systems. A key insight is that the variable that is controlled is not the output of the system (the behavioral actions), but its input, that is, a sensed and transformed function of some state of the environment that could be affected by the control system's output. Because some of these sensed and transformed inputs appear as consciously perceived aspects of the environment, Powers labelled the controlled variable "perception". The theory came to be known as "Perceptual Control Theory" or PCT rather than "Control Theory Applied to Psychology" because control theorists often assert or assume that it is the system's output that is controlled.&lt;ref name=Astrom&gt;{{cite book | last =Astrom | first =Karl J. | last2 =Murray | first2 =Richard M. | title =Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers | publisher =Princeton University Press | series = | volume = | edition = | date =2008 | location = | pages = | language = | url =http://www.cds.caltech.edu/~murray/books/AM08/pdf/am08-complete_28Sep12.pdf | doi = | id = | isbn =0-691-13576-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In PCT it is the internal representation of the state of some variable in the environment—a "perception" in everyday language—that is controlled.&lt;ref&gt;For additional information about the history of PCT, see interviews with William T.

==Example==

A simple negative feedback control system is a [[cruise control]] system for a car. A cruise control system has a sensor which "perceives" speed as the rate of spin of the drive shaft directly connected to the wheels. It also has a driver-adjustable 'goal' specifying a particular speed. The sensed speed is continuously compared against the specified speed by a device (called a "comparator") which subtracts the currently sensed input value from the stored goal value. The difference (the error signal) determines the throttle setting (the accelerator depression), so that the engine output is continuously varied to prevent the speed of the car from increasing or decreasing from that desired speed as environmental conditions change. This type of classical negative feedback control was worked out by engineers in the 1930s and 1940s.&lt;ref name="black93"&gt;Harold Black and the Negative-Feedback Amplifier, Ronald Kline, IEEE Control Systems, Aug 1993, Volume 13, Issue 4, Pages 82-85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bennett&gt;{{cite journal | last =Bennett | first =Stuart | author-link = | title =A brief history of automatic control | journal =IEEE Control Systems Magazine | volume =16 | issue =3 | pages =17–25 | publisher = | location = | date =June 1996 | language = | url =http://ieeecss.org/CSM/library/1996/june1996/02-HistoryofAutoCtrl.pdf | jstor = | issn = | doi = 10.1109/37.506394| id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = 18 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the speed of the car starts to drop below the goal-speed, for example when climbing a hill, the small increase in the error signal, amplified, causes engine output to increase, which keeps the error very nearly at zero. If the speed begins to exceed the goal, e.g. when going down a hill, the engine is throttled back so as to act as a brake, so again the speed is kept from departing more than a barely detectable amount from the goal speed (brakes being needed only if the hill is too steep). The result is that the cruise control system maintains a speed close to the goal as the car goes up and down hills, and as other disturbances such as wind affect the car's speed. This is all done without any planning of specific actions, and without any blind reactions to stimuli. Indeed, the cruise control system does not sense disturbances such as wind pressure at all, it only senses the controlled variable, speed. Nor does it control the power generated by the engine, it uses the 'behavior' of engine power as its means to control the sensed speed.

The same principles of negative feedback control (including the ability to nullify effects of unpredictable external or internal disturbances) apply to living control systems.&lt;ref name=Wiener48/&gt; The thesis of PCT is that animals and people do not control their behavior; rather, they vary their behavior as their means for controlling their perceptions, with or without external disturbances. This directly contradicts the historical and still widespread assumption that behavior is the final result of stimulus inputs and cognitive plans.&lt;ref name=Marken2009rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Miller| first =George |author2=Galanter, Eugene |author3=Pribram, Karl| title =Plans and the structure of behavior| publisher =[[Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]| year =1960| location =[[New York City|New York]]| isbn=0-03-010075-5  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The methodology of modeling, and PCT as model==

The principal datum in PCT methodology is the controlled variable. The fundamental step of PCT research, the test for controlled variables, begins with the slow and gentle application of disturbing influences to the state of a variable in the environment which the researcher surmises is already under control by the observed organism. It is essential not to overwhelm the organism's ability to control, since that is what is being investigated. If the organism changes its actions just so as to prevent the disturbing influence from having the expected effect on that variable, that is strong evidence that the experimental action disturbed a controlled variable. It is crucially important to distinguish the perceptions and point of view of the observer from those of the observed organism. It may take a number of variations of the test to isolate just which aspect of the environmental situation is under control, as perceived by the observed organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Runkel | first =Philip J. | author-link = | title =People as living things | publisher =Living Control Systems Publishing | edition = | date =2003 | location =Hayward, CA | pages =77–79  | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =0-9740155-0-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=marken.center.fielder&gt;{{cite journal | last =Marken | first =Richard S. | author-link = | title =Controlled variables: psychology as the center fielder views it | journal =American Journal of Psychology | volume =114 | issue =2 | pages =259–281 | publisher =University of Illinois Press | location = | date =2001 | language = | url = | jstor =1423517 | issn = | doi =10.2307/1423517 | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCT employs a [[black box]] methodology. The controlled variable as measured by the observer corresponds quantitatively to a reference value for a perception that the organism is controlling. The controlled variable is thus an objective index of the purpose or intention of those particular behavioral actions by the organism&amp;mdash;the goal which those actions consistently work to attain despite disturbances. With few exceptions, in the current state of [[neuroscience]] this internally maintained reference value is seldom directly observed as such (e.g. as a rate of firing in a neuron), since few researchers trace the relevant electrical and chemical variables by their specific pathways while a living organism is engaging in what we externally observe as behavior.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. works [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2EgcIyIAAAAJ&amp;hl=en listed here].&lt;/ref&gt; However, when a working negative feedback system simulated on a digital computer performs essentially identically to observed organisms, then the well understood negative feedback structure of the simulation or model (the white box) is understood to demonstrate the unseen negative feedback structure within the organism (the black box).&lt;ref name=Runkel.cast/&gt;

Data for individuals are not aggregated for statistical analysis;&lt;ref&gt;See Runkel 1990 on the limitations of statistical methods and the value of individual performance data.&lt;/ref&gt; instead, a generative model is built which replicates the data observed for individuals with very high fidelity (0.95 or better). To build such a model of a given behavioral situation requires careful measurements of three observed variables:

{|
|- valign="top"
| ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' || The input quantity, that aspect of the stimulus which the subject perceives and has been demonstrated to be controlling.
|- valign="top"
| ''q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' || The output quantity, that aspect of the subject's behavior which affects the state of ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.
|- valign="top"
| ''d'' || The disturbance, a value summing the effects that any other influences in the environment have on the state of ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. In a controlled experiment one aims to have just one disturbing influence that is under the control of the investigator, but in naturalistic observation the situation is frequently more complex.
|}

A fourth value, the internally maintained reference ''r'' (a variable ′setpoint′), is deduced from the value at which the organism is observed to maintain ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', as determined by the test for controlled variables (described at the beginning of this section).

With two variables specified, the controlled input ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the reference ''r'', a properly designed control system, simulated on a digital computer, produces outputs ''q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' that almost precisely oppose unpredictable disturbances ''d'' to the controlled input. Further, the variance from perfect control accords well with that observed for living organisms.&lt;ref name=Powers2008&gt;{{cite book | last =Powers | first =William T. | title =Living Control Systems III: The fact of control | publisher =Benchmark Publications | date =2008 | location =New Canaan, CT | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn =978-0-9647121-8-8 }} [Mathematical appendix by Dr. Richard Kennaway. Includes computer programs for the reader to demonstrate and experimentally test the theory.]&lt;/ref&gt; Perfect control would result in zero effect of the disturbance, but living organisms are not perfect controllers, and the aim of PCT is to model living organisms. When a computer simulation performs with &gt;95% conformity to experimentally measured values, opposing the effect of unpredictable changes in ''d'' by generating (nearly) equal and opposite values of ''q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'', it is understood to model the behavior and the internal control-loop structure of the organism.&lt;ref name=Runkel-PLT/&gt;&lt;ref name=PCM1960/&gt;&lt;ref name=Powers73/&gt;

By extension, the elaboration of the theory constitutes a general model of cognitive process and behavior. With every specific model or simulation of behavior that is constructed and tested against observed data, the general model that is presented in the theory is exposed to potential challenge that could call for revision or could lead to refutation.

==Mathematics==

To illustrate the mathematical calculations employed in a PCT simulation, consider a pursuit tracking task in which the participant keeps a mouse cursor aligned with a moving target on a computer monitor.

The model assumes that a perceptual signal within the participant represents the magnitude of the input quantity ''q&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''. (This has been demonstrated to be a rate of firing in a neuron, at least at the lowest levels.)&lt;ref name=Powers73&gt;{{cite book| title=[[Behavior: The Control of Perception]]| year=1973| first=William T.| last=Powers| isbn=0-7045-0092-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yin.BG2014&gt;{{cite journal | last =Yin | first =Henry H. | author-link = | title =How Basal Ganglia Outputs Generate Behavior | journal =Advances in Neuroscience | volume =2014 | issue =768313 | pages =28 | publisher =Hindawi Publishing Corporation | location = | date =18 November 2014  | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi =10.1155/2014/768313 | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the tracking task, the input quantity is the vertical distance between the target position ''T'' and the cursor position ''C'', and the random variation of the target position acts as the disturbance ''d'' of that input quantity. This suggests that the perceptual signal ''p'' quantitatively represents the cursor position ''C'' minus the target position T, as expressed in the equation ''p''=''C''&amp;ndash;''T''.

Between the perception of target and cursor and the construction of the signal representing the distance between them there is a delay of ''&amp;Tau;'' milliseconds, so that the working perceptual signal at time ''t'' represents the target-to-cursor distance at a prior time, ''t'' &amp;ndash; ''&amp;Tau;''. Consequently, the equation used in the model is

1. ''p''(''t'') = ''C''(''t&amp;ndash;&amp;Tau;'') &amp;ndash; ''T''(''t&amp;ndash;&amp;Tau;'')

The negative feedback control system receives a reference signal ''r'' which specifies the magnitude of the given perceptual signal which is currently intended or desired. (For the origin of ''r'' within the organism, see under "[[#A hierarchy of control|A hierarchy of control]]", below.) Both ''r'' and ''p'' are input to a simple neural structure with ''r'' excitatory and ''p'' inhibitory. This structure is called a "comparator".&lt;ref name=Powers73/&gt; The effect is to subtract ''p'' from ''r'', yielding an error signal ''e'' that indicates the magnitude and sign of the difference between the desired magnitude ''r'' and the currently input magnitude ''p'' of the given perception. The equation representing this in the model is:

2. ''e'' = ''r&amp;ndash;p''

The error signal ''e'' must be transformed to the output quantity ''q&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' (representing the participant's muscular efforts affecting the mouse position). Experiments have shown that in the best model for the output function, the mouse velocity ''V&lt;sub&gt;cursor&lt;/sub&gt;'' is proportional to the error signal ''e'' by a gain factor ''G'' (that is, ''V&lt;sub&gt;cursor&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''G''*''e''). Thus, when the perceptual signal ''p'' is smaller than the reference signal ''r'', the error signal ''e'' has a positive sign, and from it the model computes an upward velocity of the cursor that is proportional to the error.

The next position of the cursor ''C&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the current position ''C&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'' plus the velocity ''V&lt;sub&gt;cursor&lt;/sub&gt;'' times the duration ''dt'' of one iteration of the program. By simple algebra, we substitute ''G''*''e'' (as given above) for ''V&lt;sub&gt;cursor&lt;/sub&gt;'', yielding a third equation:

3. ''C&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''C&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''G''*''e''*''dt''

These three simple equations or program steps constitute the simplest form of the model for the tracking task. When these three simultaneous equations are evaluated over and over with the same random disturbances ''d'' of the target position that the human participant experienced, the output positions and velocities of the cursor duplicate the participant's actions in the tracking task above within 4.0% of their peak-to-peak range, in great detail.

This simple model can be refined with a damping factor ''d'' which reduces the discrepancy between the model and the human participant to 3.6% when the disturbance ''d'' is set to maximum difficulty.

3'. ''C&lt;sub&gt;new&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''C&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'' + [(''G''*''e'')&amp;ndash;(''d''*''C&lt;sub&gt;old&lt;/sub&gt;'')]*''dt''

Detailed discussion of this model in (Powers 2008)&lt;ref name=Powers2008/&gt; includes both source and executable code, with which the reader can verify how well this simple program simulates real behavior. No consideration is needed of possible nonlinearities such as the [[Weber-Fechner Law|Weber-Fechner law]], potential noise in the system, continuously varying angles at the joints, and many other factors that could afflict performance if this were a simple linear model. No [[inverse kinematics]] or predictive calculations are required. The model simply reduces the discrepancy between input ''p'' and reference ''r'' continuously as it arises in real time, and that is all that is required&amp;mdash;as predicted by the theory.&lt;ref name=Runkel-PLT/&gt;&lt;ref name="Powers73" /&gt;

==PCT as a solution to GOFAI complexity==

[Symbolic_artificial_intelligence|Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence (GOFAI)] is an early (1960s) approach to building intelligent systems. GOFAI assumes that AI programs are more complex versions of existing software designs, and that they can be built by extending existing procedural approaches and standard software methodologies. Objections to GOFAI can be separated into those based on program semantics, and those based on algorithmic complexity.

Implicit in the  theoretical approach  to GOFAI is the belief that minds (animal and human) are essentially syntactic, that is, made from symbols combined into expressions, a stance known as the [[Physical symbol system|Physical Symbol Systems Hypothesis]]. In recent years, this belief has been challenged by those who believe that minds are essentially semantic, i.e. they process embodied and situated meaning, not abstract data symbols. The 'poster child' of this oppositional stance is a thought experiment (Gedankenexperiment) called [[Chinese Room|Searle's Chinese Room (SCR)]], named after its inventor, philosopher [[John Searle]]. PCT is inherently situated, embodied, and dynamic.

Practical attempts  to building GOFAI soon run into asymptotic increases in algorithmic complexity, so-called 'complexity explosions'. They arise from the control paradigm assumed by GOFAI practitioners, which views governance (= feedforward command + feedback control) as modeling. In other words, for a GOFAI system to 'reason' about the world, it must first build an internal symbolic model of that world upon which it can apply sequences of symbolic manipulations in accord with the principles of [[Turing machine|Turing]] and [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann]] abstract machines. Even small changes in the world must be updated by the GOFAI program, in case they might be critical to its logical output. But any world model which contains sufficient detail to ensure correct GOFAI output is inevitably too complex, with too many moving parts to be practical, so that by the time world changes are updated, the world has already moved on.

PCT avoids the complexity issues of GOFAI by basing its real-time governance on a perceptual window (dimensionally reduced projection) of the world, which is much more tractable than the entire world. [[Jakob von Uexküll|Uexküll]],{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}, Dyer,{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} and Powers arrived independently at this insight, which is important for robotics.

==Distinctions from engineering control theory==

In the artificial systems that are specified by [[Control theory|engineering control theory]], the reference signal is considered to be an external input to the 'plant'.&lt;ref name=Astrom/&gt; In engineering control theory, the reference signal or set point is public; in PCT, it is not, but rather must be deduced from the results of the test for controlled variables, as described above in the [[#The methodology of modeling, and PCT as model|methodology section]]. This is because in living systems a reference signal is not an externally accessible input, but instead originates within the system. In the hierarchical model, error output of higher-level control loops, as described in the [[#A hierarchy of control|next section below]], evokes the reference signal ''r'' from synapse-local memory, and the strength of ''r'' is proportional to the (weighted) strength of the error signal or signals from one or more higher-level systems.&lt;ref name=levels&gt;{{Citation | last =Marken | first =Richard S. | first2 =Powers | last2 =William T. | contribution =Levels of intention in behavior | year =1989 | title =Volitional Action | editor-last =Hershberger | editor-first =Wayne | pages =409–430 | place =Amsterdam | publisher =Elsevier B.V. | series =Advances in psychology | volume =62 | isbn =978-0-444-88318-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In engineering control systems, in the case where there are several such reference inputs, a 'Controller' is designed to manipulate those inputs so as to obtain the effect on the output of the system that is desired by the system's designer, and the task of a control theory (so conceived) is to calculate those manipulations so as to avoid instability and oscillation. The designer of a PCT model or simulation specifies no particular desired effect on the output of the system, except that it must be whatever is required to bring the input from the environment (the perceptual signal) into conformity with the reference. In Perceptual Control Theory, the input function for the reference signal is a weighted sum of internally generated signals (in the canonical case, higher-level error signals), and loop stability is determined locally for each loop in the manner sketched in the preceding section on the [[#Mathematics of PCT|mathematics of PCT]] (and elaborated more fully in the [[#References|referenced literature]]). The weighted sum is understood to result from [[#Reorganization in evolution, development, and learning|reorganization]].

Engineering control theory is computationally demanding, but as the [[#Mathematics of PCT|preceding section]] shows, PCT is not. For example, contrast the implementation of a model of an [[inverted pendulum]] in engineering control theory&lt;ref&gt;Documented e.g. at [http://csuchico-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.4/145/4%2022%2009%20Jose%20Miranda.pdf?sequence=1 Miranda, José Luis Corona. 2009.

Hayward, CA: Living Control Systems.], with [http://www.livingcontrolsystems.com/demos/inverted_pendulum/inv_pend_dos_win.zip downloadable source and executable code]. A more detailed exposition of the differences between PCT and engineering control theory, with computer demonstrations and source code, is available at [http://www.livingcontrolsystems.com/demos/multiple_control/multiple_control.zip http://www.livingcontrolsystems.com/demos/multiple_control/multiple_control.zip]. This is one of many computer demonstrations that are available, with source code, at [http://www.livingcontrolsystems.com/demos/tutor_pct.html www.livingcontrolsystems.com/demos/tutor_pct.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

==A hierarchy of control==

Perceptions, in PCT, are constructed and controlled in a hierarchy of levels. For example, visual perception of an object is constructed from differences in light intensity or differences in sensations such as color at its edges. Controlling the shape or location of the object requires altering the perceptions of sensations or intensities (which are controlled by lower-level systems). This organizing principle is applied at all levels, up to the most abstract philosophical and theoretical constructs.

The Russian physiologist Nicolas Bernstein&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Nicolas. 1967. ''Coordination and regulation of movements''. New York: Pergamon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; independently came to the same conclusion that behavior has to be multiordinal—organized hierarchically, in layers. A simple problem led to this conclusion at about the same time both in PCT and in Bernstein's work. The spinal reflexes act to stabilize limbs against disturbances. Why do they not prevent centers higher in the brain from using those limbs to carry out behavior? Since the brain obviously does use the spinal systems in producing behavior, there must be a principle that allows the higher systems to operate by incorporating the reflexes, not just by overcoming them or turning them off. The answer is that the reference value (setpoint) for a spinal reflex is not static; rather, it is varied by higher-level systems as their means of moving the limbs. This principle applies to higher feedback loops, as each loop presents the same problem to subsystems above it.

Whereas an engineered control system has a reference value or [[Setpoint (control system)|setpoint]] adjusted by some external agency, the reference value for a biological control system cannot be set in this way. The setpoint must come from some internal process. If there is a way for behavior to affect it, any perception may be brought to the state momentarily specified by higher levels and then be maintained in that state against unpredictable disturbances. In a hierarchy of control systems, higher levels adjust the goals of lower levels as their means of approaching their own goals set by still-higher systems. This has important consequences for any proposed external control of an autonomous living control system (organism). At the highest level, reference values (goals) are set by heredity or adaptive processes.

==Reorganization in evolution, development, and learning==

If an organism controls inappropriate perceptions, or if it controls some perceptions to inappropriate values, then it is less likely to bring progeny to maturity, and may die. Consequently, by [[natural selection]] successive generations of organisms evolve so that they control those perceptions that, when controlled with appropriate setpoints, tend to maintain critical internal variables at optimal levels, or at least within non-lethal limits. Powers called these critical internal variables "intrinsic variables" (Ashby's "essential variables").

The mechanism that influences the development of structures of perceptions to be controlled is termed "reorganization", a process within the individual organism that is subject to natural selection just as is the evolved structure of individuals within a species.&lt;ref name="Byte"&gt;For an introduction, see the ''Byte'' articles on robotics and the article on the origins of purpose in this [http://www.livingcontrolsystems.com/intro_papers/bill_pct.html collection].&lt;/ref&gt;

This "reorganization system" is proposed to be part of the inherited structure of the organism. It changes the underlying parameters and connectivity of the control hierarchy in a random-walk manner. There is a basic continuous rate of change in intrinsic variables which proceeds at a speed set by the total error (and stops at zero error), punctuated by random changes in direction in a hyperspace with as many dimensions as there are critical variables. This is a more or less direct adaptation of Ashby's "[[homeostat]]", first adopted into PCT in the 1960 paper&lt;ref name=PCM1960 /&gt; and then changed to use E. coli's method of navigating up gradients of nutrients, as described by Koshland (1980).&lt;ref&gt;Koshland, Daniel. (1980). ''Bacterial chemotaxis as a model behavioral system''. New York: Raven Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reorganization may occur at any level when loss of control at that level causes intrinsic (essential) variables to deviate from genetically determined set points. This is the basic mechanism that is involved in trial-and-error learning, which leads to the acquisition of more systematic kinds of learning processes.&lt;ref name="Cziko 1995"&gt;{{cite book| title=[[Without Miracles]]| year=1995| first=Gary| last=Cziko| isbn=0-262-03232-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflict==

In a hierarchy of interacting control systems, different systems at one level can send conflicting goals to one lower system. When two systems are specifying different goals for the same lower-level variable, they are in [[:wikt:conflict|conflict]]. Protracted conflict is experienced by human beings as many forms of psychological distress such as anxiety, obsession, depression, confusion, and vacillation. Severe conflict prevents the affected systems from being able to control, effectively destroying their function for the organism.

Higher level control systems often are able to use known strategies (which are themselves acquired through prior reorganizations) to seek perceptions that don't produce the conflict. Normally, this takes place without notice. If the conflict persists and systematic "problem solving" by higher systems fails, the reorganization system may modify existing systems until they bypass the conflict or until they produce new reference signals (goals) that are not in conflict at lower levels.

When reorganization results in an arrangement that reduces or eliminates the error that is driving it, the process of reorganization slows or stops with the new organization in place. (This replaces the concept of reinforcement learning.) New means of controlling the perceptions involved, and indeed new perceptual constructs subject to control, may also result from reorganization. In simplest terms, the reorganization process varies things until something works, at which point we say that the organism has learned. When simulations of this method are done in the right way, they demonstrate that this method is surprisingly efficient.

==Psychotherapy: the method of levels (MOL)==
{{Main|Method of levels}}

The reorganization concept has led to a method of psychotherapy called the [[method of levels]] (MOL). Using MOL, the therapist aims to help the patient shift his or her awareness to higher levels of perception in order to resolve conflicts and allow reorganization to take place.&lt;ref name=Mansell.Carey.2012&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mansell |first1=Warren |last2=Carey |first2=Timothy A |last3=Tai |first3=Sara |title=A transdiagnostic approach to CBT using method of levels therapy: distinctive features |year=2012 |series=The CBT distinctive features series |location=Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon; New York |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9780415507639 |oclc=774499959 |doi=10.4324/9780203081334 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neuroscience==

===Learning===

Currently, no one theory has been agreed upon to explain the synaptic, neuronal or systemic basis of learning. Prominent since 1973, however, is the idea that [[long-term potentiation]] (LTP) of populations of [[synapse]]s induces learning through both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms (Bliss &amp; Lømo, 1973; Bliss &amp; Gardner-Medwin, 1973). LTP is a form of [[Hebbian learning]], which proposed that high-frequency, tonic activation of a circuit of neurones increases the efficacy with which they are activated and the size of their response to a given stimulus as compared to the standard neurone (Hebb, 1949).&lt;ref name=Hebb49&gt;{{cite book | last =Hebb | first =Donald | title =The organization of behavior: A neuropsychological theory | publisher =Wiley &amp; Sons | date =1949 | location =New York | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These mechanisms are the principles behind Hebb's famously simple explanation: "Those that fire together, wire together" (Hebb, 1949).

LTP has received much support since it was first observed by [[Terje Lømo]] in 1966 and is still the subject of many modern studies and clinical research. However, there are possible alternative mechanisms underlying LTP, as presented by Enoki, Hu, Hamilton and Fine in 2009, published in the journal ''[[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]]''. They concede that LTP is the basis of learning. However, they firstly propose that LTP occurs in individual synapses, and this plasticity is graded (as opposed to in a binary mode) and bidirectional (Enoki et al., 2009). Secondly, the group suggest that the synaptic changes are expressed solely presynaptically, via changes in the probability of transmitter release (Enoki et al., 2009). Finally, the team predict that the occurrence of LTP could be age-dependent, as the plasticity of a neonatal brain would be higher than that of a mature one. Therefore, the theories differ, as one proposes an on/off occurrence of LTP by pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms and the other proposes only presynaptic changes, graded ability, and age-dependence.

These theories do agree on one element of LTP, namely, that it must occur through physical changes to the synaptic membrane/s, i.e. synaptic plasticity. Perceptual control theory encompasses both of these views. It proposes the mechanism of [[#Reorganization in evolution, development, and learning|'reorganisation']] as the basis of learning. Reorganisation occurs within the inherent control system of a human or animal by restructuring the inter- and intraconnections of its hierarchical organisation, akin to the neuroscientific phenomenon of neural plasticity. This reorganisation initially allows the trial-and-error form of learning, which is seen in babies, and then progresses to more structured learning through association, apparent in infants, and finally to systematic learning, covering the adult ability to learn from both internally and externally  generated stimuli and events. In this way, PCT provides a valid model for learning that combines the biological mechanisms of LTP with an explanation of the progression and change of mechanisms associated with developmental ability (Plooij 1984,&lt;ref name=Plooij1984&gt;{{cite book | last =Plooij | first =Frans X. | title =The behavioral development of free-living chimpanzee babies and infants. | publisher =Ablex | date =1984 | location =Norwood, N.J. | pages = | language = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 1987,&lt;ref name=Plooij-Plooij1987&gt;{{cite journal | last =van de Rijt-Plooij | first =Hetty | last2 =Plooij | first2 =Frans | author-link = | title =Growing independence, conflict and learning in mother-infant relations in free-ranging chimpanzees | journal =Behaviour | volume =101 | issue = | pages =1–86 | publisher = | location = | date =1987 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi = 10.1163/156853987x00378| id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2003,&lt;ref name=Plooij2003&gt;{{Citation | last =Plooij | first =Frans X. | contribution = | year =2003 | title =The trilogy of mind | editor-last =Heimann | editor-first =M. | volume =Regression periods in human infancy | pages =185–205 | place =Mahwah, New Jersey | publisher =Erlbaum | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plooij &amp; Plooij (1990),&lt;ref name=Plooij-Plooij1990&gt;{{cite journal | last =Plooij | first =Frans X. | last2 =van de Rijt-Plooij | first2 =Hetty | title =Developmental transitions as successive reorganizations of a control hierarchy | journal =American Behavioral Scientist | volume =34 | issue = | pages =67–80 | publisher = | location = | date =1990 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi = 10.1177/0002764290034001007| id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2013&lt;ref name="Plooij-Plooij2013"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=[[The Wonder Weeks]]: How to Stimulate Your Baby's Mental Development and Help Him Turn His 10 Predictable, Great, Fussy Phases into Magical Leaps Forward|last=van de Rijt-Plooij|first=Hetty|last2=Plooij|first2=Frans|date=October 22, 2013|publisher=Kiddy World Publishing|year=|isbn=9491882007|location=Arnhem, Netherlands|pages=480|language=|doi=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Powers (2008) produced a simulation of arm co-ordination.&lt;ref name=Powers2008/&gt; He suggested that in order to move your arm, fourteen control systems that control fourteen joint angles are involved, and they reorganise simultaneously and independently. It was found that for optimum performance, the output functions must be organised in a way so as each control system's output only affects the one environmental variable it is perceiving. In this simulation, the reorganising process is working as it should, and just as Powers suggests that it works in humans, reducing outputs that cause error and increasing those that reduce error. Initially, the disturbances have large effects on the angles of the joints, but over time the joint angles match the reference signals more closely due to the system being reorganised. Powers (2008) suggests that in order to achieve coordination of joint angles to produce desired movements, instead of calculating how multiple joint angles must change to produce this movement the brain uses negative feedback systems to generate the joint angles that are required. A single reference signal that is varied in a higher-order system can generate a movement that requires several joint angles to change at the same time.&lt;ref name=Powers2008/&gt;

===Hierarchical organisation===

Botvinick (2008) proposed that one of the founding insights of the cognitive revolution was the recognition of hierarchical structure in human behavior. Despite decades of research, however, the computational mechanisms underlying hierarchically organized behavior are still not fully understood. Bedre, Hoffman, Cooney &amp; D'Esposito (2009) propose that the fundamental goal in cognitive neuroscience is to characterize the functional organization of the frontal cortex that supports the control of action.

Recent neuroimaging data has supported the hypothesis that the frontal lobes are organized hierarchically, such that control is supported in progressively caudal regions as control moves to more concrete specification of action. However, it is still not clear whether lower-order control processors are differentially affected by impairments in higher-order control when between-level interactions are required to complete a task, or whether there are feedback influences of lower-level on higher-level control (Bedre, Hoffman, Cooney &amp; D'Esposito 2009).

Botvinik (2008) found that all existing models of hierarchically structured behavior share at least one general assumption – that the hierarchical, part–whole organization of human action is mirrored in the internal or neural representations underlying it. Specifically, the assumption is that there exist representations not only of low-level motor behaviors, but also separable representations of higher-level behavioral units. The latest crop of models provides new insights, but also poses new or refined questions for empirical research, including how abstract action representations emerge through learning, how they interact with different modes of action control, and how they sort out within the prefrontal cortex (PFC).

Perceptual control theory (PCT) can provide an explanatory model of neural organisation that deals with the current issues. PCT describes the hierarchical character of behavior as being determined by control of hierarchically organized perception. Control systems in the body and in the internal environment of billions of interconnected neurons within the brain are responsible for keeping perceptual signals within survivable limits in the unpredictably variable environment from which those perceptions are derived. PCT does not propose that there is an internal model within which the brain simulates behavior before issuing commands to execute that behavior. Instead, one of its characteristic features is the principled lack of cerebral organisation of behavior. Rather, behavior is the organism's variable means to reduce the discrepancy between perceptions and reference values which are based on various external and internal inputs (Cools, 1985). Behavior must constantly adapt and change for an organism to maintain its perceptual goals. In this way, PCT can provide an explanation of abstract learning through spontaneous reorganisation of the hierarchy. PCT proposes that conflict occurs between disparate reference values for a given perception rather than between different responses (Mansell 2011), and that learning is implemented as trial-and-error changes of the properties of control systems (Marken &amp; Powers 1989),&lt;ref name=levels/&gt; rather than any specific response being ''reinforced''. In this way, behavior remains adaptive to the environment as it unfolds, rather than relying on learned action patterns that may not fit.

Hierarchies of perceptual control have been simulated in computer models and have been shown to provide a close match to behavioral data. For example, Marken&lt;ref name=Marken86&gt;{{cite journal | last =Marken | first =Richard S. | author-link = | title =Perceptual organization of behavior: A hierarchical control model of coordinated action. | journal =Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance | volume =12 | issue =3 | pages =267–276 | publisher = | location = | date =Aug 1986 | language = | url = | jstor = | issn = | doi =10.1037/0096-1523.12.3.267 | id = | mr = | zbl = | jfm = | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted an experiment comparing the behavior of a perceptual control hierarchy computer model with that of six healthy volunteers in three experiments. The participants were required to keep the distance between a left line and a centre line equal to that of the centre line and a right line. They were also instructed to keep both distances equal to 2&amp;nbsp;cm. They had 2 paddles in their hands, one controlling the left line and one controlling the middle line. To do this, they had to resist random disturbances applied to the positions of the lines. As the participants achieved control, they managed to nullify the expected effect of the disturbances by moving their paddles. The correlation between the behavior of subjects and the model in all the experiments approached .99. It is proposed that the organization of models of hierarchical control systems such as this informs us about the organization of the human subjects whose behavior it so closely reproduces.

==Robotics==

PCT has significant implications for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. The architecture, of a hierarchy of perceptual controllers, is an ideal and comparatively simple implementation for artificial systems by avoiding the need to generate specific actions whether by complex models of the external world or the computation from input-output mappings. 
This is in stark contrast to traditional methodologies, such as the computational approach and Behavior-based Robotics.

The application of perceptual control to Robotics was outlined in a seminal paper &lt;ref name=Young2017&gt;{{cite journal | last =Young| first =Rupert | author-link = | title =A General Architecture for Robotics Systems: A Perception-Based Approach to Artificial Life. | journal =Artificial Life| volume =23 | issue =2 | pages =236–286 | date =Jun 2017 | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Artificial Life journal by Rupert Young of Perceptual Robots in 2017.  The architecture has been applied to a number of real-world robotic systems including robotic rovers,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional approaches to robotics, which generally depend upon the computation of actions in specific situations, result in inflexible, clumsy robots unable to cope with the dynamic nature of the world. PCT robots, on the other hand, demonstrate robots that inherently resist and counter the chaotic, unpredictable world.

==Current situation and prospects==

The preceding explanation of PCT principles provides justification of how this theory can provide a valid explanation of neural organisation and how it can explain some of the current issues of conceptual models.

Perceptual control theory currently proposes a hierarchy of 11 levels of perceptions controlled by systems in the human mind and neural architecture. These are: intensity, sensation, configuration, transition, event, relationship, category, sequence, program, principle, and system concept. Diverse perceptual signals at a lower level (e.g. visual perceptions of intensities) are combined in an input function to construct a single perception at the higher level (e.g. visual perception of a color sensation). The perceptions that are constructed and controlled at the lower levels are passed along as the perceptual inputs at the higher levels. The higher levels in turn control by adjusting the reference levels (goals) of the lower levels, in effect telling the lower levels what to perceive.&lt;ref name=Powers73/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cziko 1995"/&gt;

While many computer demonstrations of principles have been developed, the proposed higher levels are difficult to model because too little is known about how the brain works at these levels. Isolated higher-level control processes can be investigated, but models of an extensive hierarchy of control are still only conceptual, or at best rudimentary.

Perceptual control theory has not been widely accepted in mainstream psychology, but has been effectively used in a considerable range of domains&lt;ref&gt;https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-28/november-2015/perceptual-control-revolution&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/06/book-review-behavior-the-control-of-perception/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IJHCS"&gt;The June 1999 Issue of ''The International Journal of Human-Computer Studies'' contained papers ranging from tracking through cockpit layout to self-image and crowd dynamics.&lt;/ref&gt; in human factors,&lt;ref name="CBUT"&gt;PCT lies at the foundation of [[Component-Based Usability Testing]].&lt;/ref&gt; clinical psychology, and psychotherapy (the "[[Method of Levels]]"), it is the basis for a considerable body of research in sociology,&lt;ref&gt;For example: McClelland, Kent A. and Thomas J.

'''Political geography''' is concerned with the study of both the spatially uneven outcomes of [[politics|political]] processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures. Conventionally, for the purposes of analysis, political geography adopts a three-scale structure with the study of [[State (polity)|the state]] at the centre, the study of [[international relations]] (or [[geopolitics]]) above it, and the study of localities below it. The primary concerns of the subdiscipline can be summarized as the inter-relationships between people, state, and territory.

== History ==

The British geographer [[Halford Mackinder]] was also heavily influenced by environmental determinism and in developing his concept of the 'geographical pivot of history'  or the [[The Geographical Pivot of History|Heartland Theory]] (in 1904) he argued that the era of sea power was coming to an end and that land based powers were in the ascendant, and, in particular, that whoever controlled the heartland of 'Euro-Asia' would control the world.  This theory involved concepts diametrically opposed to the ideas of [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] about the significance of ''sea power'' in world conflict.  The heartland theory hypothesized the possibility of a huge empire being created which didn't need to use coastal or transoceanic transport to supply its [[military–industrial complex]], and that this empire could not be defeated by the rest of the world allied against it.  This perspective proved influential throughout the period of the [[Cold War]], underpinning military thinking about the creation of [[buffer state]]s between East and West in central Europe.

The heartland theory depicted a world divided into a ''Heartland'' (Eastern Europe/Western Russia); ''World Island'' (Eurasia and Africa); ''Peripheral Islands'' (British Isles, Japan, Indonesia and Australia) and ''New World'' (The Americas). Mackinder argued that whoever controlled the Heartland would have control of the world. He used these ideas to politically influence events such as the [[Treaty of Versailles]], where buffer states were created between the [[USSR]] and [[Germany]], to prevent either of them controlling the Heartland.  At the same time, Ratzel was creating a theory of states based around the concepts of Lebensraum and [[Social Darwinism]].  He argued that states were analogous to 'organisms' that needed sufficient room in which to live.  Both of these writers created the idea of a political and geographical [[science]], with an [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective]] view of the world.  Prior to [[World War II]] political geography was concerned largely with these issues of global power struggles and influencing state policy, and the above theories were taken on board by German geopoliticians (see [[Geopolitik]]) such as [[Karl Haushofer]] who - perhaps inadvertently - greatly influenced [[Nazism|Nazi]] political theory, which was a form of politics seen to be legitimated by such 'scientific' theories.

The close association with environmental determinism and the freezing of political boundaries during the Cold War led to a significant decline in the perceived importance of political geography, which was described by Brian Berry in 1968 as a 'moribund backwater'.  Although at this time in most other areas of human geography new approaches, including quantitative spatial science, behavioural studies, and structural Marxism, were invigorating academic research these were largely ignored by political geographers whose main point of reference remained the regional approach.  As a result, most of the political geography texts produced during this period were descriptive, and it was not until 1976 that Richard Muir could argue that political geography was no longer a dead duck, but could in fact be a phoenix.

== Areas of study ==
[[File:13.8 scharf.png|thumb|right|The [[Brandenburg Gate]] of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961.]]

From the late-1970s onwards, political geography has undergone a renaissance, and could fairly be described as one of the most dynamic of the sub-disciplines today. The revival was underpinned by the launch of the journal ''Political Geography Quarterly'' (and its expansion to bi-monthly production as ''Political Geography''). In part this growth has been associated with the adoption by political geographers of the approaches taken up earlier in other areas of human geography, for example, [[Ron J. Johnston]]'s (1979) work on electoral geography relied heavily on the adoption of quantitative spatial science, Robert Sack's (1986) work on territoriality was based on the behavioural approach, [[Henry Bakis]] (1987) showed the impact of information and telecommunications networks on political geography, and Peter Taylor's (e.g. 2007) work on World Systems Theory owed much to developments within structural Marxism.  However, the recent growth in vitality and importance of this sub-discipline is also related to the changes in the world as a result of the end of the Cold War.  With the emergence of a new world order (which as yet, is only poorly defined) and the development of new research agendas, such as the more recent focus on social movements and political struggles, going beyond the study of nationalism with its explicit territorial basis. There has also been increasing interest in the geography of green politics (see, for example, David Pepper's (1996) work), including the geopolitics of environmental protest, and in the capacity of our existing state apparatus and wider political institutions, to address any contemporary and future environmental problems competently.

Political geography has extended the scope of traditional political science approaches by acknowledging that the exercise of power is not restricted to states and bureaucracies, but is part of everyday life.  This has resulted in the concerns of political geography increasingly overlapping with those of other human geography sub-disciplines such as economic geography, and, particularly, with those of social and cultural geography in relation to the study of the politics of place (see, for example, the books by David Harvey (1996) and Joe Painter (1995)).  Although contemporary political geography maintains many of its traditional concerns (see below) the multi-disciplinary expansion into related areas is part of a general process within human geography which involves the blurring of boundaries between formerly discrete areas of study, and through which the discipline as a whole is enriched&lt;ref&gt;Simandan D. 2011. Kinds of environments—a framework for reflecting on the possible contours of a better world. The Canadian Geographer/Le Géographe canadien, 55(3), pp. 383-386.  https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1541-0064.2010.00334.x &lt;/ref&gt;.

In particular, contemporary political geography often considers:
* How and why states are organized into regional groupings, both formally (e.g. the [[European Union]]) and informally (e.g. the [[Third World]])
* The relationship between states and former colonies, and how these are propagated over time, for example through [[neo-colonialism]]
* The relationship between a [[government]] and its people
* The relationships between states including international trades and treaties
* The functions, demarcations and policing of boundaries
* How [[imagined geographies]] have political implications
* The influence of political power on geographical space
* The political implications of modern media (e.g. radio, TV, ICT, Internet, social networks)
* The study of election results (electoral geography)

===Critical political geography===
{{See also|Critical geopolitics}}

Critical political geography is mainly concerned with the criticism of traditional political geographies vis-a-vis modern trends.  As with much of the move towards 'Critical geographies', the arguments have drawn largely from [[postmodern]], [[post structural]] and [[postcolonial]] theories&lt;ref&gt;Simandan D. 2010. Beware of contingency. Environment and planning. D: Society and Space, 28(3), pp. 388-396. https://doi.org/10.1068/d2310&lt;/ref&gt;.  Examples include:
* [[Feminist geography]], which argues for recognition of the power relations as [[patriarchal]] and attempts to theorise alternative conceptions of [[Personal identity|identity]] and [[identity politics]]&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, J., 2007. Geography and gender: Finding feminist political geographies. Progress in Human Geography, 31(3), pp.381-387.&lt;/ref&gt;. Alongside related concerns such as [[Queer theory]] and [[Youth studies]]
* [[Postcolonial]] theories which recognise the [[Imperialistic]], universalising nature of much political geography, especially in [[Development geography]]&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, J., 2003. Political geography in a postcolonial context. Political Geography, 22(6), pp.647-651.&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Environmental justice]] which addresses the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, or income with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Justice and Environmentalism: The Social Justice Challenge to the Environmental Movement|last=|first=|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2007|isbn=0262195526|location=|pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is a human right for all people to share equally in the benefits bestowed by a healthy environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Environmental Justice Reader: Politics, Poetics, &amp; Pedagogy|last=|first=|publisher=The University of Arizona Press|year=2002|isbn=0816522065|location=|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several definitions for '''professional abuse''' and distinctions are usually pronounced in definitions according to professional fields. One of the general descriptions, however, that sought to bridge the variations was put forward by the National Council of Psychotherapists, which explained professional abuse as a violation of an organization's [[Ethical code|code of ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://natcouncilofpsychotherapists.org.uk/Newsletter/Ed001/Professional_Abuse.html|title=Professional Abuse|last=O'Sullivan|first=Michael|date=|website=natcouncilofpsychotherapists.org.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources refer to this as standards of behavior, which include the maintenance of [[professional boundaries]] and the treatment of people with respect and dignity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/guides-to-support-and-services/abuse/abuse-by-health-and-social-care-workers/#.W2mcjNIzbDd|title=Abuse by health and social care workers {{!}} Mind, the mental health charity - help for mental health problems|website=www.mind.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more comprehensive version of this description states that this type of abuse is "a pattern of conduct in which a person abuses, violates, or takes advantage of a victim within the context of the abuser's profession."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.net/what-is-professional-abuse.htm|title=What Is Professional Abuse?|work=wiseGEEK|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional abusers are the individuals who prey on the weaknesses of others in their workplaces or in other places related to economical strands of society. Their fundamental behavior is based in the following actions:

* taking advantage of their client or patient's [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]]
* exploiting their [[vulnerability]]
* not acting in their best interests
* failing to keep [[professional boundaries]]

== Forms of abuse ==
There are many forms of abuse. It may be:
* [[discriminatory]]
* [[Abuse#Financial abuse|financial]]
* [[physical abuse|physical]]
* [[psychological abuse|psychological]]
* [[sexual abuse|sexual]]

Professional abuse always involves:
* [[betrayal]]
* [[wikt:exploit|exploitation]]
* violation of professional boundaries

Professionals can abuse in three ways:
* [[nonfeasance]] - ignore and take no indicated action - neglect.
* [[misfeasance]] - take inappropriate action or give intentionally incorrect advice.
* [[malfeasance]] - hostile, aggressive action taken to injure the client's interests.

== Solutions ==
There are several strategies available to organizations seeking to address professional abuse. A study, for instance, revealed that this problem often arises when there is an extreme power imbalance between the professional and the victim. A framework based on different grades of client empowerment and ways of strengthening it can help solve the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=S.|date=2000|title=Client empowerment in psychiatry and the professional abuse of clients: where do we stand?|journal=International Journal of Psychiatry in Medicine|volume=30|issue=1|pages=61–70|doi=10.2190/AC9N-YTLE-B639-M3P4|issn=0091-2174|pmid=10900561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who have been subjected to professional abuse could also pursue any of the following courses of actions: lodging a complaint; reporting abuse to the police; and, taking legal action.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

There are also organizations that can help those who are victimized learn more about their rights and the options available to them.

'''Quantitative psychology''' is a field of scientific study that focuses on the [[mathematical modeling]], research design and methodology, and [[statistics|statistical analysis]] of human or animal psychological processes. It includes tests and other devices for measuring human abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantitative Psychology|url=http://www.apa.org/research/tools/quantitative/index.aspx|website=American Psychological Association|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantitative psychologists develop and analyze a wide variety of research methods, including those of [[psychometrics]], a field concerned with the theory and technique of psychological measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Classification of Instructional Programs – Psychometrics and Quantitative Psychology|url=http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/cipdetail.aspx?y=55&amp;cipid=87539|website=The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have long contributed to statistical and mathematical analysis, and quantitative psychology is now a specialty recognized by the [[American Psychological Association]]. Doctoral degrees are awarded in this field in a number of universities in Europe and North America, and quantitative psychologists have been in high demand in industry, government, and academia. Their training in both [[social science]] and quantitative methodology provides a unique skill set for solving both applied and theoretical problems in a variety of areas.

== History ==
[[File:Galton's correlation diagram 1875.jpg|175px|thumbnail|right|[[Francis Galton]]'s [[correlation]] diagram, 1875.]]
Quantitative psychology has its roots in early [[experimental psychology]] when, in the nineteenth century, the scientific method was first systematically applied to psychological phenomena. Notable contributions included E. H. Weber's studies of tactile sensitivity (1930s), [[Gustav Fechner|Fechner's]] development and use of the psychophysical methods (1850-1860), and [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz's]] research on vision and audition beginning after 1850. [[Wilhelm Wundt]] is often called the "founder of experimental psychology", because he called himself a psychologist and opened a psychological laboratory in 1879 where many researchers came to study.&lt;ref&gt;E. Hearst (ed) The First Century of Experimental Psychology, 1979, pp. 19-20, Hillsdale, NJ: Earlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; The work of these and many others helped put to rest the assertion, by theorists such as [[Immanuel Kant]], that psychology could not become a science because precise experiments on the human mind were impossible.

=== Intelligence testing ===
{{main|intelligence testing}}
[[Intelligence testing]] has long been an important branch of quantitative psychology. The nineteenth-century English statistician [[Francis Galton]], a pioneer in psychometrics, was the first to create a standardized test of intelligence, and he was among the first to apply   statistical methods to the study of human differences and their inheritance. He came to believe that intelligence is largely determined by heredity, and he also hypothesized that other measures such as the speed of [[reflex]]es, [[muscle]] strength, and head size are correlated with intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Bulmer, M. (1999). The development of Francis Galton's ideas on the mechanism of heredity. ''Journal of the History of Biology, 32''(3), 263-292. Cowan, R. S. (1972). Francis Galton's contribution to genetics. ''Journal of the History of Biology, 5''(2), 389-412. See also Burbridge, D. (2001). Francis Galton on twins, heredity and social class. ''British Journal for the History of Science, 34''(3), 323-340.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fancher, R. E. (1983). Biographical origins of Francis Galton's psychology. ''Isis, 74''(2), 227-233.&lt;/ref&gt; He established the world's first mental testing center in 1882 in the following year he published his observations and theories in "Inquiries into Human Faculty and Its Development".

=== Statistical techniques ===
[[File:IQ curve.svg|250px|thumbnail|left|[[IQ]] scores represented by a [[normal distribution]].]]
Statistical methods are the quantitative tools most used by psychologists. Pearson introduced the correlation coefficient and the chi-squared test. The 1900–1920 period saw the t-test (Student, 1908), the ANOVA (Fisher, 1925) and a non-parametric correlation coefficient (Spearman, 1904). A large number of tests were developed in the latter half of the 20th century (e.g., all the multivariate tests). Popular techniques (such as Hierarchical Linear Model, Arnold, 1992, Structural Equation Modeling, Byrne, 1996 and Independent Component Analysis, Hyvarinën, Karhunen and Oja, 2001) are relatively recent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cousineau|first1=Denis|title=The rise of quantitative methods in psychology|journal=Tutorial in Quantitative Methods for Psychology|date=2005|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–3|url=http://doe.concordia.ca/cslp/Downloads/PDF/The%20rise%20of%20..art.pdf|accessdate=1 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304024719/http://doe.concordia.ca/cslp/Downloads/PDF/The%20rise%20of%20..art.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, psychologist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] organized [[levels of measurement]] into four scales: Nominal, Ordinal, Ratio, and Interval  in a paper that is still often cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=June 7, 1946 |last=Stevens |first=Stanley Smith |title=On the Theory of Scales of Measurement |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=103 |issue=2684 |pages=677–680 |doi=10.1126/science.103.2684.677 |pmid=17750512 |url=http://www.mpopa.ro/statistica_licenta/Stevens_Measurement.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120906231510/http://www.mpopa.ro/statistica_licenta/Stevens_Measurement.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 6, 2012 |accessdate=September 16, 2010 |bibcode=1946Sci...103..677S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jacob Cohen (statistician)|Jacob Cohen]], a [[New York University]] professor of psychology, analyzed quantitative methods involving statistical power and effect size, which helped to lay foundations for current statistical [[meta-analysis]] and the methods of estimation statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/04/04708608/0470860804-2.pdf Cohen's entry in Encyclopedia of Statistics in Behavioral Science]&lt;/ref&gt; He gave his name to [[Cohen's kappa]] and [[Cohen's d]].

In 1990, an influential paper titled "Graduate Training in Statistics, Methodology, and Measurement in Psychology" was published in the [[American Psychologist]] journal. This article discussed the need for increased and up-to-date training in quantitative methods for psychology graduate programs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aiken|first1=Leona S.|last2=West|first2=Stephen G.|title=Graduate Training in Statistics, Methodology, and Measurement in Psychology: A Survey of PhD Programs in North America|journal=American Psychologist|date=June 1990|volume=45|issue=6|pages=721–734|url=http://psych.wustl.edu/memory/Roddy%20article%20PDF%27s/Aiken%20et%20al%20%281990%29_AmPsy.pdf|accessdate=19 January 2015|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.45.6.721|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119163608/http://psych.wustl.edu/memory/Roddy%20article%20PDF%27s/Aiken%20et%20al%20%281990%29_AmPsy.pdf|archive-date=2015-01-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and training ==
{{Main|List of schools for quantitative psychology}}

=== Undergraduate ===
Training for quantitative psychology can begin informally at the undergraduate level. Many graduate schools recommend that students have some coursework in psychology and complete the full college sequence of [[calculus]] (including [[multivariate calculus]]) and a course in [[linear algebra]]. Quantitative coursework in other fields such as [[economics]] and research methods and statistics courses for psychology majors are also helpful. Historically, however, students without all these courses have been accepted if other aspects of their application show promise. Some schools also offer formal minors in areas related to quantitative psychology. For example, the [[University of Kansas]] offers a minor in "Social and Behavioral Sciences Methodology" that provides advanced training in research methodology, applied data analysis, and practical research experience relevant to quantitative psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Undergraduate Minor in Social and Behavioral Sciences Methodology|url=http://www2.ku.edu/~distinction/cgi-bin/social-behavioral-sciences|website=University of Kansas|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coursework in computer science is also useful. Mastery of an [[object-oriented programming language]] or learning to write code in [[SPSS]] or [[R (programming language)|R]] is useful for the type of data analysis performed in graduate school.

=== Graduate ===
[[File:Peabodyvu.JPG|250px|thumbnail|right|[[Peabody College]] (''pictured'') at [[Vanderbilt University]] houses their Quantitative Methods program.]]
Quantitative psychologists may possess a doctoral degree or a master's degree. Due to its interdisciplinary nature and depending on the research focus of the university, these programs may be housed in a school's [[college of education]] or in their psychology department. Programs that focus especially in [[educational research]] and psychometrics are often part of education or [[educational psychology]] departments. These programs may therefore have different names mentioning "research methods" or "quantitative methods", such as the "Research and Evaluation Methodology" Ph.D from the [[University of Florida]] or the "Quantitative Methods" degree at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. However, some universities may have separate programs in their two colleges. For example, the [[University of Washington]] has a "Quantitative psychology" degree in their psychology department and a separate "Measurement &amp; Statistics" Ph.D in their college of education. Others, such as [[Vanderbilt University]]'s Ph.D in Psychological Sciences is jointly housed across its two psychology departments.

Universities with a mathematical focus include [[McGill University]]'s "Quantitative Psychology and Modeling" program and [[Purdue University]]'s "Mathematical and Computational Cognitive Science" degrees. Students with an interest in modeling biological or functional data may go into related fields such as [[biostatistics]] or [[computational neuroscience]].

Doctoral programs typical accept students with only bachelor's degrees, although some schools may require a master's degree before applying. After the first two years of studies, graduate students typically earn a [[Master of Arts]] in Psychology, [[Master of Science]] in Statistics or [[Applied statistics]], or both.

Additionally, several universities offer minor concentrations in quantitative methods, such as New York University.

Companies that produce [[standardized tests]] such as [[College Board]], [[Educational Testing Service]], and [[American College Testing]] are some of the biggest private sector employers of quantitative psychologists. These companies also often provide internships to students in graduate school.

==== Shortage of qualified applicants ====
In August 2005, the American Psychological Association expressed the need for more quantitative psychologists in the industry—for every PhD awarded in the subject, there were about 2.5 quantitative psychologist position openings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apa.org/research/tools/quantitative/quant-task-force-report.pdf Report of the Task Force for Increasing the Number of Quantitative Psychologists], page 1. ''American Psychological Association''. Retrieved February 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a lack of applicants in the field, the APA created a Task Force to study the state of quantitative psychology and predict its future. Domestic U.S. applicants are especially lacking. The majority of international applicants come from [[Asia]]n countries, especially [[South Korea]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name="taskforce"&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Task Force for Increasing the Number of Quantitative Psychologists|url=http://www.apa.org/research/tools/quantitative/quant-task-force-report.pdf|website=American Psychological Association|accessdate=13 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the lack of qualified applicants, the APA Council of Representatives authorized a special task force in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quantitative Psychology|url=http://www.apa.org/research/tools/quantitative/|website=American Psychological Association|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task force was chaired by Leona S. Aiken from [[Arizona State University]].

== Research areas ==
[[File:Social Red.jpg|200px|thumbnail|left|Example of a [[social network]] diagram.]]
Quantitative psychologists generally have a main area of interest.&lt;ref name="Prinstein2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mitchell J. Prinstein|title=The Portable Mentor: Expert Guide to a Successful Career in Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CxbWtXF6QAgC&amp;pg=PA24|date=31 August 2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-3993-6|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable research areas in psychometrics include [[item response theory]] and [[computer adaptive testing]], which focus on education and [[intelligence testing]]. Other research areas include modeling psychological processes through [[time series]] analysis, such as in [[fMRI]] data collection, and [[structural equation modeling]], [[social network analysis]], [[decision theory|human decision science]], and [[statistical genetics]].

Two common types of psychometric tests are: aptitude tests, which are supposed to measure raw intellectual ability, and personality tests that aim to assess your character, temperament, and how you deal with problems.

Item response theory is based on the application of related [[mathematical model]]s to testing data. Because it is generally regarded as superior to [[classical test theory]], it is the preferred method for developing scales in the United States, especially when optimal decisions are demanded, as in so-called [[High-stakes testing|high-stakes tests]], e.g., the [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE) and [[Graduate Management Admission Test]] (GMAT).

== Professional organizations ==
Quantitative psychology is served by several scientific organizations.  These include the Psychometric Society, Division 5 of the [[American Psychological Association]] (Evaluation, Measurement and Statistics), the [[Society of Multivariate Experimental Psychology]], and the European Society for Methodology.  Associated disciplines include statistics, [[mathematics]], educational measurement, educational statistics, sociology, and political science.  Several scholarly journals reflect the efforts of scientists in these areas, notably ''[[Psychometrika]]'', ''Multivariate Behavioral Research'', ''Structural Equation Modeling'' and ''Psychological Methods''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8157">'''Rapoport's rule''' is an [[ecogeographical rule]] that states that [[latitude|latitudinal]] ranges of [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s are generally smaller at lower latitudes than at higher latitudes.

==Background==

Stevens (1989)&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, G. C. (1989). ''The latitudinal gradients in geographical range: how so many species co-exist in the tropics''. American Naturalist 133, 240–256.&lt;/ref&gt; named the rule after [[Eduardo H. Rapoport]], who had earlier provided evidence for the phenomenon for subspecies of [[mammal]]s (Rapoport 1975,&lt;ref&gt;Rapoport, E. H. (1975). ''Areografía. Estrategias Geográficas de las Especies''. Fondo de Cultura Económica, México&lt;/ref&gt; 1982&lt;ref&gt;Rapoport, E. H. (1982). ''Areography. Geographical Strategies of Species''. Trad. B. Drausal, Pergamon Press, Oxford. {{ISBN|978-0-08-028914-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Stevens used the rule to "explain" greater species diversity in the tropics in the sense that [[latitudinal gradients in species diversity]] and the rule have identical exceptional data and so must have the same underlying cause. Narrower ranges in the tropics would facilitate more species to coexist. He later extended the rule to altitudinal gradients, claiming that altitudinal ranges are greatest at greater altitudes (Stevens 1992&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, G. C. (1992). The elevational gradient in altitudinal range: an extension of Rapoport's latitudinal rule to altitude. American Naturalist 140, 893–911.&lt;/ref&gt;), and to depth gradients in the oceans (Stevens 1996&lt;ref name="Stevens1996"&gt;Stevens, G. C. (1996). Extending Rapoport's rule to Pacific marine fishes. Journal of Biogeography 23:149–154.&lt;/ref&gt;). The rule has been the focus of intense discussion and given much impetus to exploring distributional patterns of plants and animals. Stevens' original paper has been cited about 330 times in the scientific literature.

==Generality==

Support for the generality of the rule is at best equivocal.&lt;ref name="Rapoport;s rule: time 1996)"&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0169-5347(97)01236-6 Gaston, K. J., Blackburn, T. M. and Spicer, J. I. (1998). Rapoport's rule: time for an epitaph? Trends in Ecology and Evolution 13, 70–74.]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, marine teleost fishes have the greatest latitudinal ranges at low latitudes.&lt;ref name="Rohde1992"&gt;Rohde, K. (1992). Latitudinal gradients in species diversity: the search for the primary cause. Oikos 65, 514–527.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohde1993"&gt;Rohde, K., Heap, M. and Heap, D. (1993). Rapoport's rule does not apply to marine teleosts and cannot explain latitudinal gradients in species richness. American Naturalist, 142, 1–16.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, freshwater fishes do show the trend, although only above a latitude of about 40 degrees North.&lt;ref name="Rohde1993"/&gt; Some subsequent  papers have found support for the rule, others, probably even more numerous, have found exceptions to it.&lt;ref name="Rapoport;s rule: time 1996)"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. (1999). Latitudinal gradients in species diversity and Rapoport's rule revisited: a review of recent work, and what can parasites teach us about the causes of the gradients? Ecography, 22, 593–613&lt;/ref&gt; For most groups that have been shown to follow the rule, it is restricted to or at least most distinct above latitudes of about 40–50 degrees. Rohde therefore concluded that the rule describes a local phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Rohde1996"&gt;Rohde, K. (1996). Rapoport's Rule is a local phenomenon and cannot explainlatitudinal gradients in species diversity. Biodiversity Letters, 3, 10–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Computer simulations using the [[Chowdhury Ecosystem Model]] did not find support for the rule.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.thbio.2006.01.002 Stauffer, D., and Rohde, K., 2006. Simulation of Rapoport's rule for latitudinal species spread. Theory in Bioscioences 125(1): 55–65.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanations==

Rohde (1996)&lt;ref name="Rohde1996"/&gt; explained the fact that the rule is restricted to very high latitudes by effects of glaciations which have wiped out species with narrow ranges, a view also expressed by Brown (1995).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, J. H. (1995). Macroecology. University of Chicago Press, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; Another explanation of Rapoport's rule is the "climatic variability" or "seasonal variability hypothesis".&lt;ref name="Stevens1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letcher, A. J., and [[Paul H. Harvey|Harvey, P. H.]] (1994) Variation in geographical range size among mammals of the Palearctic. American Naturalist 144:30–42.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this hypothesis, seasonal variability selects for greater climatic tolerances and therefore wider latitudinal ranges (see also Fernandez and Vrba  2005&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez, M. H. and Vrba, E. S. (2005). Rapoport effect and biomic specialization in African mammals: revisiting the climatic variability hypothesis. Journal of Biogeography 32, 903–918.&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Methods used to demonstrate the rule==

The methods used to demonstrate the rule have been subject to some controversy. Most commonly, authors plot means of latitudinal ranges in a particular 5° latitudinal band against latitude, although modal or median ranges have been used by some.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, K., Jablonski, D. and Valentine, J. W. (1994). Eastern Pacific molluscan provinces and latitudinal diversity gradients: no evidence for Rapoport's rule. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA 91, 88.71–8874.&lt;/ref&gt; In the original paper by Stevens, all species occurring in each band were counted, i.e., a species with a range of 50 degrees occurs in 10 or 11 bands. However, this may lead to an artificial inflation of latitudinal ranges of species occurring at high latitudes, because even a few tropical species with wide ranges will affect the means of ranges at high latitudes, whereas the opposite effect due to high latitude species extending into the tropics is negligible: species diversity is much smaller at high than low latitudes. As an alternative method the "midpoint method" has been proposed, which avoids this problem. It counts only those species with the midpoint of their ranges in a particular latitudinal band.&lt;ref name="Rohde1993"/&gt;  An additional complication in assessing Rapoport's rule for data based on field sampling is the possibility of a spurious pattern driven by a sample-size artifact. Equal sampling effort at species-rich and species-poor localities tends to underestimate range size at the richer localities relative to the poorer, when in fact range sizes might not differ among localities.&lt;ref name="ColwellHurtt 1994"&gt;Colwell, R. K., and G. C. Hurtt. (1994). Nonbiological gradients in species richness and a spurious Rapoport effect. American Naturalist 144:570–595.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biotic and abiotic factors which act against the rule==

Marine benthic invertebrates and some parasites have been shown to have smaller dispersal abilities in cold seas ([[Thorson's rule]]), which would counteract Rapoport's rule. The tropics have far more uniform temperatures over a far wider latitudinal range (about 45 degrees) than high latitude species. As temperature is one of the most important (if not the most important) factor determining geographical distribution, wider latitudinal ranges in the tropics might therefore be expected.

==Evolutionary age==

The inconsistent results concerning Rapoport's rule suggest that certain characteristics of species may be responsible for their different latitudinal ranges.  These characteristics may include, for example, their evolutionary age: species that have evolved recently in the tropics may have small latitudinal ranges because they have not had the time to spread far from their origin, whereas older species have extended their ranges.&lt;ref&gt;Rohde, K. (1998). Latitudinal gradients in species diversity. Area matters, but how much? Oikos 82, 184–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7293">{{Distinguish|Richter magnitude scale}}

The '''Riddle scale''' (also known as ''Riddle homophobia scale'' or ''Riddle scale of homophobia'') was a [[psychometric]] [[Scale (social sciences)|scale]] that measured the degree to which a person is or is not [[homophobic]]. The scale was frequently used in tolerance education about [[anti-discriminatory]] attitudes regarding [[sexual orientation]]. It is named after its creator, psychologist [[Dorothy Riddle]].

==Overview==
The Riddle homophobia scale was developed by [[Dorothy Riddle]] in 1973–74 while she was overseeing research for the [[American Psychological Association]] Task Force on Gays and Lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silgbtcenter.org/ Staten Island LGBT history] Staten Island LGBT Community Center, Accessed Dec. 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The scale was distributed at talks and workshops but was not formally published for a long time; it is cited in the literature either as an (unpublished) conference presentation from 1985&lt;ref&gt;Riddle, D. I. (1985). Homophobia scale. ''Opening doors to understanding and acceptance: A facilitator’s guide for presenting workshops on lesbian and gay issues'', Workshop organized by Kathy Obear and Amy Reynolds, Boston. Unpublished essay.&lt;/ref&gt; or as an article from 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Riddle, D., (1994). The Riddle scale. ''Alone no more: Developing a school support system for gay, lesbian and bisexual youth.'' St Paul: Minnesota State Department.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time it was developed, Riddle's analysis was one of the first modern classifications of attitudes towards homosexuality.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In that respect, the scale has served the purpose that Riddle originally had in mind: she devised the scale to explicate the continuum of attitudes toward gays and lesbians and to assess the current and desired institutional culture of an organization or a work place.&lt;ref&gt;Peterkin, A. Risdon, C., (2003). ''Caring for lesbian and gay people: A clinical guide.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Level of measurement==
The Riddle scale is an eight-term uni-[[dimension]]al [[Likert scale|Likert]]-type [[Level of measurement#Interval scale|interval scale]] with nominal labels and no explicit [[Origin (mathematics)|zero point]]. Each term is associated with a set of attributes and beliefs; individuals are assigned a position on the scale based on the attributes they exhibit and beliefs they hold.

The scale is frequently divided into two parts, the 'homophobic levels of attitude' (first four terms) and the 'positive levels of attitude' (last four terms).&lt;ref&gt;Clauss-Ehlers, C. S. (ed), (2010). ''Encyclopedia of Cross-Cultural School Psychology''. New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The scale==
*'''Repulsion''': Homosexuality is seen as a crime against nature. Gays/lesbians are considered sick, crazy, immoral, sinful, wicked, etc. Anything is justified to change them: [[incarceration]], [[hospital]]ization, [[Reparative therapy|behavior therapy]], [[electroconvulsive therapy]], etc.
*'''Pity''': Represents heterosexual [[chauvinism]]. Heterosexuality is considered more mature and certainly to be preferred. It is believed that any possibility of becoming straight should be reinforced, and those who seem to be born that way should be pitied as less fortunate ("the poor dears").
*'''Tolerance''': Homosexuality is viewed as a phase of adolescent development that many people go through and most people grow out of. Thus, lesbians/gays are less mature than straights and should be treated with the protectiveness and indulgence one uses with children who are still maturing. It is believed that lesbians/gays should not be given positions of authority because they are still working through their adolescent behavior.
*'''Acceptance''': Still implies that there is something to accept; the existing climate of discrimination is ignored. Characterized by such statements as "You're not lesbian to me, you're a person!" or "What you do in bed is your own business." or "That's fine with me as long as you don't flaunt it!"
*'''Support''': People at this level may be uncomfortable themselves, but they are aware of the homophobic climate and the irrational unfairness, and work to safeguard the rights of lesbians and gays.
*'''Admiration''': It is acknowledged that being lesbian/gay in our society takes strength.  People at this level are willing to truly examine their homophobic attitudes, values, and behaviors.
*'''Appreciation''': The diversity of people is considered valuable and lesbians/gays are seen as a valid part of that diversity. People on this level are willing to combat homophobia in themselves and others.
*'''Nurturance''': Assumes that gay/lesbian people are indispensable in our society. People on this level view lesbians/gays with genuine affection and delight, and are willing to be their allies and advocates.

==Discussion==
Riddle's analysis has been credited for pointing out that although 'tolerance' and 'acceptance' can be seen as positive attitudes, they should actually be treated as negative because they can mask underlying fear or hatred (somebody can tolerate a baby crying on an airplane while at the same time wishing that it would stop) or indicate that there is indeed something that we need to accept, and that we are the ones with the power to reject or to accept.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenfeld W. J. (2000). How homophobia hurts everyone. ''Readings for diversity and social justice''. New York: Routledge, 267–275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ollis, D., (2004). I’m just a home economics teacher. Does discipline background impact on teachers’ ability to affirm and include [[gender and sexual diversity]] in secondary school health education programs? ''AARE Conference'', Melbourne 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This observation generalizes to attitude evaluations in other areas besides sexual orientation and is one of the strengths of Riddle's study.

Although it deals mostly with adult attitudes towards difference, the model has been positioned in the cognitive developmental tradition of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg|Kohlberg's]] [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]].&lt;ref&gt;Hirscheld, S., (2001). Moving beyond the safety zone: A staff development approach to anti-heterosexist education. ''Fordham Urban Law Journal'', 29, 611–641.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a psychometric scale, the Riddle scale has been considered to have acceptable [[face validity]] but its exact [[Psychometrics#Key concepts|psychometric properties]] are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Finkel, M. J., Storaasli, R. D., Bandele, A., and Schaefer, V., (2003). Diversity training in graduate school: An exploratory evaluation of the safe zone project. ''Professional Psychology: Research and Practice'', 34, 555–561.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, E. W, and Potocky-Tripodi, M., (2006).

The '''Tchaikovsky House-Museum''' was the country home in [[Klin, Klinsky District, Moscow Oblast|Klin]], 85 kilometers northwest of [[Moscow]] where [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] lived from May 1892 until his death in 1893.  His last major work, the [[Symphony No. 6 (Tchaikovsky)|6th Symphony]], was written there. The house is now a museum.

==Tchaikovsky in Klin==
In 1885 Tchaikovsky wrote to his friend and [[patron]], "These days I dream of settling in a village not far from Moscow. I can't wander any longer, and I'm anxious to come and stay at a place where I can feel at home." Early that year he rented a small house in the village of Maidanovo (Майданово) two kilometers from the small town of Klin. Later between 1888 and 1891 he rented a house in another nearby village, Frolovskoye (Фроловское). (Both the Maidanovo house and the later Frolovskoye house were later demolished.)  Tchaikovsky lived in the Maidanovo house from February 1885 until March 1888.  The house was located on the bank of the Sestra River, and had but overgrown park with ponds and old lime trees. It was not far from the railway station to both Moscow and [[St. Petersburg]], but far enough from the city to deter unwelcome visitors, so he would not be disturbed. In the Maidanovo house Tchaikovsky rewrote an old opera he had composed in 1874, ''[[Vakula the Smith]]'', transforming it into a new opera, ''[[Cherevichki]]''. He also wrote the [[Manfred symphony]] and another opera, ''[[The Enchantress (opera)|Charodeika]]''. In the evenings Tchaikovsky read magazines and books, played the piano, had conversations with guests, strolled in the forest, gathered mushrooms, gardened and swam.

Unfortunately for Tchaikovsky, increasing numbers of vacationers came to Maidanovo, along with increasing numbers of people who wanted to see him. After a three-month concert tour to Europe, he decided to move to another house in the area, in the village of Frolovskoye.  In May 1892 Tchaikovsky wrote to his brother Anatoly:  "I rented a house in Klin to live there. Probably you saw it - the Sakharovs' house, large, comfortable, out-of-town, near the highway to Moscow...I am in need - and I feel it - of having a house in the countryside, or, which is almost the same, in Klin, to make sure that I can get, whenever I wish, a calm, quiet place to work. Besides, I've become accustomed to Klin. The view from inside the house is really wonderful, and there is a rather large garden. I am thinking of buying this house in the future."

During his time at the house in Klin, Tchaikovsky finished proof-reading the scores of ''[[Iolanta]]'' and ''[[The Nutcracker]],'' wrote eighteen piano pieces, Opus 72; The vocal quartet ''The Night'';  six romances to the words of Rathaus; and the 6th Symphony.

On October 3, 1893, he finished his [[Piano Concerto No. 3 (Tchaikovsky)|Piano Concert No. 3]].  On October 7 he departed from Klin for Moscow, and then to St. Petersburg where he conducted the premiere of Symphony No. 6.  He died in St. Petersburg on October 25 (November 6 new style) at the age of 53.

==Tchaikovsky's work habits==
Tchaikovsky's daily routine at Klin was described by his brother and biographer, [[Modest Tchaikovsky]]:
"Pyotr Ilyich got up between 7 and 8 a.m. in the morning. After tea and reading, he would go for a walk which usually lasted about an hour. A conversation at breakfast, as well as a walk in someone's company, meant that Tchaikovsky was not going to compose that day; instead he would be busy with instrumentation, making corrections, or writing letters.

After dinner, he went for a walk again in any weather. Solitude during walks was as necessary for him as it was during work.  In those moments he thought over the main musical themes and formed the ideas of future compositions.".&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Belonovich, pg. 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;

==The interior of the Tchaikovsky House==

The house was built in the 1870s, by V.S. Sakharov, on land given to the family by Emperor [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]]. It was rarely used by the Sakharov family, which rented and then sold it to Tchaikovsky. Tchaikovsky lived on the second floor, while the family of his servant, Alexei Sofronov, lived on the ground floor. The kitchen and dining room were also on the first floor.

The reception room and study on the second floor, where his piano is located, is the largest room of the house. 
The piano is a Becker, which was given him by the St. Petersburg firm in 1885, when he first arrived in Maidanovo.  Tchaikovsky never played the piano in a concert hall for an audience, but he did play at home for his guests, and enjoyed playing duets on the piano with visiting musicians. His evening entertainments also usually included oral readings of literature.&lt;ref&gt;Belonovich, pg. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

His writing desk, where he wrote letters every morning after breakfast, is at the end of the room. Over the desk, in the place of honor, is a picture of [[Anton Rubenstein]], the founder of the [[St. Petersburg Conservatory of Music]] and his first teacher of instrumentation and composing. Just below the picture of Rubenstein is a picture of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]. On the other walls are many photographs of his family, in particular of his father, Ilya Petrovich Tchaikovsky, and his mother, Alexandra Andreyevna. Nearby are two bookcases containing his musical library and his library of Russian and foreign literature, and the bound sets of magazines to which his subscribed. The other cabinets in the room are filled with gifts to Tchaikovsky, including an ink-pot in the form of the Statue of Liberty given to him during his visit to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Belonovich, pg. 90-102&lt;/ref&gt;

The bedroom of the composer adjoins the reception room through a doorway covered with a curtain. He composed music in this room on a plain unpainted table overlooking the garden. The table was made of Karelian birch by village workers in Maidanovo, when he first settled in the Klin region. This was the table on which Tchaikovsky composed his 6th Symphony, the Pathetique, the last major work before his death.

==Tchaikovsky's garden==
[[File:Tchaikovsky's Garden at Klin.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Tchaikovsky's garden with a bed of lilies of the valley]]
In his final years,  Tchaikovsky was strongly attracted to nature, country life.  and his garden.  He wrote to [[Nadezhda von Meck]]:  "The nearer I approach old age, the more lovely is my pleasure being close to nature. Never before have I reveled so much in the beauty of spring, the awakening vegetation, birds returning home - in short, everything which is brought by the Russian spring, actually the most beautiful and jovial spring on earth."&lt;ref&gt;Collected letters to Nadezdha Von Meck, cited by Belonovich, pg. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

He also wrote: "It is impossible to suggest a better a more suitable way of living than in the countryside.  After each new trip to Moscow I come to realize more and more how city life ruins me. Each time I return here I'm completely ill, but I immediately recover in my quiet corner."&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Belonovich, pg. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

His garden was not tidy and orderly, but rather like an idealized forest, with a winding path and a [[gazebo]] at the far end from the house. Tchaikovsky adored flowers, particularly the wild flowers of the fields and forest that he saw on his daily walks. He was especially fond of the [[lily of the valley]], to which he even wrote a poem. After his death, his brother Modest planted islands of lilies of the valley around the garden, along with the [[Viola mandshurica|violets]], [[Myosotis|forget-me-nots]], and [[Hyacinthoides non-scripta|bluebells]] that Tchaikovsky admired. The garden has many other varieties of flowers it had in Tchaikovsky's time: [[rose]]s, [[begonia]]s, [[gillyflower]]s, [[phlox]]es, and [[Nicotiana alata|sweet tobacco]].&lt;ref&gt;Belonovich, pg. 90-91.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The house and the Museum after Tchaikovsky's death==
[[File:Monument to Tchaikovsky, Klin.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Statue of Tchaikovsky near his garden at Klin]]
After Tchaikovsky's death, his younger brother, [[Modest Tchaikovsky]], a playwright and translator, decided to create a museum, the first such musical and memorial museum in Russia.  The composer's nephew, [[Vladimir Davydov]], who held the rights to Tchaikovsky's works, joined in the project.  They built a separate house on the grounds so the main house could remain as it was, and made an archive of Tchaikovsky's musical scores, manuscripts and library.  Modest Tchaikovsky wrote the first biography of Tchaikovsky,

When Modest Tchaikovsky died in 1916, he willed the house to the Moscow Department of the [[Russian Musical Society]], with the requirement that it strictly follow the rules of the Mozart Museum in [[Salzburg]] and the [[Beethoven House|Beethoven Museum]] in [[Bonn]].

In 1917, after the [[October Revolution|Bolshevik revolution]],  an [[Anarchism|anarchist]] named Doroshenko settled with his family in the museum, and was reported to have fired shots at the portrait of Pope Innocent hanging in one of the bedrooms.  He was finally arrested in April, 1918. In 1918 the museum was given the status of protected site by the [[People's Commissariat for Education]], and in 1921 it was declared to be property of the state.

Following the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of Russia]] in June 1941, the museum collection of memorabilia and the library were transferred to the small town of [[Votkinsk]], Tchaikovsky's birthplace, in [[Udmurtia]]. The house was occupied by the Germans during the [[Battle of Moscow]] in 1941-42. They used the first floor as a garage for motorcycles and the upper floor as a barracks.  At the end of 1944, the exhibits were returned, and the museum opened again on May 6, 1945, on the eve of Tchaikovsky's birthday.&lt;ref&gt;Belonovich, pg. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s it became a tradition for musicians to gather and perform at the house on May 7 each year to commemorate Tchaikovsky's birthday.  Noted pianists, including [[Vladimir Horowitz]], were given the privilege of playing Tchaikovsky's grand piano in his salon.  Beginning in 1958, winners of the annual [[International Tchaikovsky Competition]], including [[Van Cliburn]] (1958), [[Mikhail Pletnev]] (1978) and [[Boris Berezovsky (pianist)|Boris Berezovsky]] (1990), were also invited to come to Klin to play his piano. Musicians from the competition began a tradition of planting [[oak|oak trees]] in the garden.

In 1964, a concert hall, exhibit space and visitor center was opened near the house.

'''''The Case for God''''' is a 2009 book by [[Karen Armstrong]]. It is an answer to the recent claims that God does not exist from [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Christopher Hitchens]], [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] and [[Daniel Dennett]] and focuses on the three [[Abrahamic religions]]: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] from the paleolithic age to the present day. Also included are [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]].

Among the themes of the book are [[apophatic theology]] and intellectualism versus practice. Armstrong claims that the fundamental reality, later called [[God]], [[Brahman]], [[nirvana]] or [[Tao]], transcends human concepts and thoughts, and can only be known through devoted religious practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/jul/04/case-for-god-karen-armstrong|title=All quiet on the God front|date=4 July 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2009/07/religion-armstrong-god-case|title=The Case for God: What Religion Means  By Karen Armstrong |last=Byrnes|first=Sholto|date=16 July 2009|work=[[New Statesman]]|access-date=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/books/review/Douthat-t.html|title=Perpetual Revelations|date=1 October 2009|work=[[New York Times]]|access-date=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/non-fiction/article6619456.ece|title=The Case for God: What Religion Really Means by Karen Armstrong|date=5 July 2009|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2009/09/10/out-out-damned-atheists.html|title=Out, Out, Damned Atheists: Karen Armstrong weighs in on God.|last=Miller|first=Lisa|date=11 September 2009|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|access-date=2014-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

In the introduction, Armstrong presents two forms of knowledge, ''[[Logos#Jung.27s analytical psychology|mythos]]'' and ''[[logos]]''.{{sfn|Armstrong|p=xi}} Since the 16th and 17th century, she says ''logos'' governed civilization, resulting in two phenomena: [[fundamentalism]] and [[atheism]].{{sfn|Armstrong|p=xv}} Armstrong says that the [[new atheism|"new" atheists]] have made some valid criticisms of religion, stating "I can sympathize with the irritation of the new atheists". But she maintains that they have focused primarily on fundamentalism. She says they "aren't radical enough" and finds their work "disappointingly shallow".{{sfn|Armstrong|p=xvi}} According to Armstrong, "My aim in this book is simply to bring something fresh to the table."{{sfn|Armstrong|p=xvii}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1775">'''The Society for the Preservation of Historic Buildings''' of the [[United Kingdom]] was founded initially as a pressure group to counter the demolition of [[Historic site|historic buildings]] and it resolved later to acquire historically significant properties in order to maintain and protect them itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sphb.org.uk/ Organization homepage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821104238/http://www.sphb.org.uk/ |date=2008-08-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3063">The [[idiom]] '''tongue-in-cheek''' refers to a humorous or sarcastic statement expressed in a mock serious manner.

==History==
The phrase originally expressed contempt, but by 1842 had acquired its modern meaning.&lt;ref name=owens/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Contrastive metaphor of Korean and English revealed in 'mouth' and 'tongue' expressions |first=H. | last=Chay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Use Your Body |first =I. G. |last= Zoltan |journal=Philologia |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early users of the phrase include [[Sir Walter Scott]] in his 1828 ''[[The Fair Maid of Perth]]''.

The physical act of putting one's [[tongue]] into one's [[cheek]] once signified contempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=From the Horse's Mouth |first=John |last=Ayto |publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BC8_tRvBSvsC&amp; |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-954379-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Tobias Smollett]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Roderick Random]],'' which was published in 1748, the eponymous hero takes a coach to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and on the way, apprehends a [[highwayman]]. This provokes an altercation with a less brave passenger:
{{quote|He looked back and pronounced with a faltering voice, 'O! 'tis very well—damn my blood! I shall find a time.'  I signified my contempt of him by thrusting my tongue in my cheek, which humbled him so much, that he scarce swore another oath aloud during the whole journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ld8kAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA200 |title=The adventures of Roderick Random | first=Tobias George |last=Smollett |year=1780}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The phrase appears in 1828 in ''[[The Fair Maid of Perth]]'' by [[Sir Walter Scott]]: 
{{quote|The fellow who gave this all-hail thrust his tongue in his cheek to some [[:wikt:scapegrace|scapegrace]]s like himself.}}

It's not clear how Scott intended readers to understand the phrase.&lt;ref name=owens&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsok.com/article/3176644/1196722011 |title='Tongue in cheek' is cut-and-dried phrase|date=4 December 2007 |work=The Oklahoman|first=Gene |last= Owens | quote=... Novelist Sir Walter Scott used 'tongue in cheek' as early as 1828 in 'The Fair Maid of Perth,' but it isn't clear what he meant. |publisher= Phrases.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more modern [[irony|ironic]] sense appears in the 1842 poem "[[The Ingoldsby Legends]]" by the English clergyman [[Richard Barham]], in which a Frenchman inspects a watch and cries:
{{quote|'' 'Superbe!  Magnifique!' '' / (with his tongue in his cheek)&lt;ref name=owens/&gt;}}

The ironic usage originates with the idea of suppressed mirth&amp;mdash;biting one's tongue to prevent an outburst of laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AEL0XOWn0sEC&amp;pg=PA37 |title=The body language phrasebook |first=Nick |last=Marshallsay |publisher= Collins &amp; Brown |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-84340-304-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data and Methods (WISERD)''' is an interdisciplinary [[social science]] research centre, with its administrative base at [[Cardiff University]], [[Wales]]. Its aim is to draw together and build upon the existing expertise in quantitative and qualitative research methods and methodologies .

The Institute is a collaborative venture between the Universities of Cardiff, [[Swansea University|Swansea]], [[Aberystwyth University|Aberystwyth]], [[Bangor University|Bangor]] and [[University of South Wales|South Wales]]. Funding is jointly provided by the [[Welsh Assembly Government]] (via the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales, [[HEFCW]]), and the UK [[Economic and Social Research Council]] ([[ESRC]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiserd.ac.uk/ WISERD official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research, Data &amp; Methods (WISERD) was established in 2008. Its current Director is Professor Ian Rees Jones.&lt;ref&gt;http://wiserd.ac.uk/about-us/staff/wiserd-staff/prof-ian-rees-jones/&lt;/ref&gt; The principal aims of WISERD are:
* To develop the quality and quantity of social science research in Wales, particularly through externally funded research projects
* To promote collaborative research activity across the participating universities and across disciplines and sectors
* To develop the social science research infrastructure in Wales
* To strengthen the impact of social science research on the development of policy in the public, private and third sectors through a focus on knowledge exchange and engagement

WISERD seeks to achieve these aims through two programmes: a research programme and a research infrastructure programme.

WISERD's research programme consists of activities from basic science to applied research projects, within the following key themes: Civil Society; Education; Health, Wellbeing and Social Care; Economic and Social Inequalities; Localities; and Data and Methods.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiserd.ac.uk/research/&lt;/ref&gt;

==WISERD Civil Society==
WISERD Civil Society is a research centre, launched in October 2014 and funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]]. It is undertaking a five-year programme of research addressing Civil Society in Wales, the UK and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wiserd.ac.uk/research/civil-society/&lt;/ref&gt;

Its four research themes are:
* [[Locality (settlement)|Locality]], [[Community]] and [[Civil Society]]
* [[Institutions]] and [[Governance]]
* [[Economic Austerity]], [[Social Enterprise and Equality]]
* [[Generation]], [[Life Course]] and [[Social Participation]]
