'''''13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey''''' is a book first published in [[1969 in literature|1969]] by [[folklore|folklorist]] [[Kathryn Tucker Windham]] and Margaret Gillis Figh. The book contains thirteen [[ghost story|ghost stories]] from the U.S. state of [[Alabama]]. The book was the first in a series of seven ''Jeffrey'' books, most featuring ghost stories from a [[Southern United States|Southern state]]. Jeffrey in the book's title refers to a [[ghost]] that allegedly haunts Windham's home.&lt;ref name="WINDHAM"&gt;{{cite web |title=Kathryn Tucker Windham |url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1582 |date=30 June 2008 |first=Frances Osborn |last=Robb |publisher=Encyclopedia of Alabama |accessdate=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BHAMNEWS"&gt;{{cite news| first=Jeremy| last=Gray| url=http://www.uasystem.ua.edu/Administration/News%20clips/Clips%20110405.pdf| title=The tale of the tale-teller| publisher=The Birmingham News| date=2005-10-30| accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of the book and Jeffrey==
The foreword of the book describes how Windham came to be interested in ghost stories. It began with ghostly incidents in the Windham family home in [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]] that Windham attributed to a spirit she dubbed "Jeffrey". At first, the family heard footsteps in rooms that would later be found empty. A supposed photograph of Jeffrey, included in the book, was taken inside the home. On the night the picture was made, some young people visiting the house decided to play with a [[Ouija|Ouija board]], trying to contact Jeffrey. When they developed the photos taken that night, a shadowy vaguely human-like shape was seen beside a girl in the photograph. Soon after it was taken Windham contacted Figh, who was a noted collector of ghost stories, to ask about Jeffrey. Out of that meeting, the idea of ''13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey'' was born.&lt;ref name="JEFFREY"&gt;{{cite book | last =Windham | first =Kathryn Tucker |author2=Figh, Margaret Gillis | year =1969 | title =13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey | publisher =Strode Publishers | isbn =0-8173-0376-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the preface to the book, Windham says that although there are many ghost stories in Alabama, she wanted to choose stories for her book that had "entertained many generations" and were "a treasured part of Southern folklore". Windham sought stories from which she could describe not only the ghost, but also the community and lifestyles of the people who first reported the haunting. Windham spends as much time describing the people and places around the ghost stories as she does the ghost itself.&lt;ref name="BHAMNEWS"/&gt;

==Stories included==
* [[Rocky Hill Castle|The Ghost of the Angry Architect]]
* [[Dr. John R. Drish House|Death Lights in the Tower]]
* The Faithful Vigil at [[Kenworthy Hall|Carlisle Hall]]
* The Specter in the Maze at [[Cahaba, Alabama|Cahaba]]
* [[Eliza Battle|The Phantom Steamboat of the Tombigbee]]
* The Unquiet Ghost at [[Gaineswood]]
* The Face in the [[Pickens County Courthouse (Alabama)|Courthouse]] Window
* [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile's]] Pipe-Smoking Captain
* [[Sturdivant Hall|The Return of the Ruined Banker]]
* [[Bill Sketoe|The Hole That Will Not Stay Filled]]
* [[Red Lady of Huntingdon College|Huntingdon College's Red Lady]]
* The Crying Spirit at the Well
* The Dancing Ghost of [[Grancer Harrison]]

==Controversy==
Despite being very popular in Alabama, the book attracted some controversy from certain Christians in the state who said that the book promoted beliefs incompatible with Christianity. In fact, Windham said that she had received letters from people telling her she is doomed to hell for writing the ''Jeffrey'' books.&lt;ref name="BHAMNEWS"/&gt; In an interview with ''[[The Birmingham News]]'', Windham responded to these claims, saying "If I'm going to hell — and I can't deny that, because it's not for me to judge — it won't be for telling ghost stories; I have far greater shortcomings than that."&lt;ref name="BHAMNEWS"/&gt;

==Adaptations==
''13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey'' has been adapted into a stage musical by Don Everett Garrett and Kevin Francis Finn.&lt;ref name="REDMTC"&gt;{{cite web |title=13 Alabama Ghosts and Jeffrey |url=http://www.redmountaintheatre.org/1011-13-alabama-ghosts-and-jeffrey.html |publisher=Red Mountain Theatre Company |accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kathryn Tucker Windham gave her blessing for the adaptation and saw the premiere at Red Mountain Theatre Company's Cabaret Theatre in October 2010, prior to her death. The musical is now available to schools and arts organizations from the authors.

*London sees a controversy between actors and watermen.

The watermen respond by proposing to limit the locations of the theatres around London, much to the actors' displeasure. The rebuilt [[Globe Theatre]] opens by June, and [[Philip Henslowe]]'s new [[Hope Theatre]] opens in October, negating the watermen's complaint. [[John Taylor (poet)|John Taylor the Water Poet]] describes the controversy in his ''The True Cause of the Watermen's Suit Concerning Players''.

[[File:AXIS Dance Company.jpg|thumb|right|300px|AXIS Dance Company members [[Sonsherée Giles]] and [[Rodney Bell]] perform an award-winning dance piece by [[Joe Goode]] in 2008.]]
'''AXIS Dance Company''' is a professional [[physically integrated dance|physically integrated]] [[contemporary dance]] company and dance education organization founded in 1987 and based in [[Oakland, California]]. It is one of the first contemporary dance companies in the world to consciously develop [[choreography]] that integrates dancers with and without [[physical disability|physical disabilities]]. Their work has received nine [[Isadora Duncan Dance Awards]] and nine additional nominations for both their artistry and production values.

==Physically integrated dance==
Founded in 1987&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bruce |last=Weber |title=A Dance Company Mixes Arms, Legs and Wheels |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/01/arts/dance/01sfculture.html |work=The New York Times |page=A37B |date=2009-11-01 |accessdate=2009-11-13  }}&lt;/ref&gt; by Thais Mazur, Bonnie Lewkowicz, Judith Smith and others, AXIS was one of the first contemporary dance companies in the world to consciously develop choreography that integrates dancers with and without physical disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Allan |last=Ulrich |title=Review: Axis Dance Company at Malonga Casquelord |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/11/08/DDEO1AGQRJ.DTL |work= San Francisco Chronicle |page=E-1 |date=2009-11-08 |accessdate=2009-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rona |last=Marech |title=Rebel filmmaker's movie about Burning Man screens in Oakland |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2002/03/08/EB78192.DTL |work= San Francisco Chronicle |page=EB-3 |date=2002-03-08 |accessdate=2008-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; AXIS dancers with disabilities have included wheelchair users (both manual wheelchairs and power wheelchairs), crutch users, and people with amputations using prosthetic limbs.

AXIS dancers who are not disabled come with training in a variety of contemporary dance, [[improvisation]] and other movement practices. Through interactions between these dancers and nondisabled dancers, a new dance vocabulary began to be developed. This started a trend, which eventually became known as physically integrated dance, which seeks to broaden the definition of ‘dance’ and ‘dancer’  and increase opportunities for artistic expression through movement for a wide spectrum of physical attributes and disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Moving Over the Edge: Artists with Disabilities Take the Leap |last=Pamela Kay |first=Walker |year=2005 |publisher=Michael Horton Media |location=Davis, California |pages=112–117 |isbn=0-9771505-2-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Interview, Judith Smith, “Artistic Director, AXIS Dance Company” conducted by Esther Ehrlich in 2005, Regional Oral History Office, The Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley, 2006. [http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/ROHO/projects/artistsdis/ Artists with Disabilities Oral History Page]&lt;/ref&gt; The physically integrated dance movement is part of a broader disability culture movement, which recognizes and celebrates the first-person experience of disability, not as a [[medical model of disability|medical-model]] construct but as [[Social model of disability|a social phenomenon]], through artistic, literary, and other creative means.&lt;ref&gt;ABC-CLIO Companion to the Disability Rights Movement, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; The AXIS Dance Company has commissioned works by a number of renowned choreographers, including Ann Carlson, Sonya Delwaide, Joe Goode, Joanna Haigood, Margaret Jenkins, [[Bill T. Jones]], Victoria Marks, and [[Stephen Petronio]].

===National Convening===
In May 2016 during its 30th anniversary season, AXIS Dance Company hosted the first, three-day ''National Convening: The Future of Physically Integrated Dance in the USA'' at [[Gibney Dance]] in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Judith |last=Smith |title=Activating National and Local Connections to Further Physically Integrated Dance |url=http://dancersgroup.org/2016/12/physically-integrated-dance/ |work=Dancers’ Group |date=2016-12-01 |accessdate=2018-05-13  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This event was supported by the [[Doris Duke]] Charitable Foundation National Project Program, and culminated in the creation of the report, ''The Future of Physically Integrated Dance in the USA'', which looks at “ways to 1) improve and expand training opportunities and develop pedagogy for dancers with disabilities; and 2) improve training and expand opportunities for disabled choreographers and nondisabled choreographers to work with disabled dancers or integrated ensembles.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Judith |last=Smith |title=AXIS Dance Company: Advocacy  |url=http://www.axisdance.org/advocacy/ |work=AXIS Dance Company |date=2017 |accessdate=2018-05-13  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Landscape with a Ruined Castle and a Church''''' (c. 1665) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] landscape painter [[Jacob van Ruisdael]].
It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the collection of the [[National Gallery]].
== Description ==
This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1911, who wrote; "136. Landscape with Cornfields, and Sheep and Figures. 
[[John Smith (art historian)|Sm. 214.]] A far-reaching view across an open plain varied with woods, meadows, and cornfields, villages and churches amid trees, cottages and 
windmills. In front are the ruins of a castle with a stagnant moat, fringed with trees and underwood. On the left a winding road passes a cornfield with sheaves and a group of trees and is lost in the distance. A shepherd sits on the old castle-wall, conversing with a youth seated on the ground, near a dog and three sheep. On a bastion, on the other side, are three sheep ; in a breach of the bastion stands a man. On a pool are three swans. The figures and cattle are by [[Adriaen van de Velde|A. van de Velde]]. A thunderstorm has just passed over. In the sky are masses of rolling cloud, through which sunbeams fall on windmills in the distance. The rest of the landscape is in partial shadow. "This capital picture may be cited as a chef d'oeuvre of the artist in this peculiar department of landscape-painting " (Sm.). [Compare 775, 776.] Canvas, 43 inches by 57 inches. Exhibited at Manchester, 1857, No. 699, by R. Sanderson. Sale. [[Jan Gildemeester]], Amsterdam, June 11, 1800, No. 190 (315 florins, 
Tays). In the collection of the Marquis de Marialva, Paris, 1825 ; bought privately by Sm. Sales. John Smith, London, 1828 (£472 : 10s.). 
Abrahams, London, 1831 (£275). In the collection of Richard Sanderson, London, 1835 (Sm.). Sale. R. Sanderson, London, June 17, 1848 (£504, Brown) ; but apparently 
bought in, for it was in the Sanderson collection in 1854 ([[Gustav Friedrich Waagen|Waagen]], ii. 288), and was lent from it to Manchester in 1857. "&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn04hofsuoft#page/48/mode/1up  Entry 136 for ''''Landscape with Cornfields, and Sheep and Figures''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

This scene is very similar to other paintings Ruisdael made in this period.

'''Anglo-Saxon art''' covers art produced within the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] period of English history, beginning with the [[Migration period art|Migration period]] style that the Anglo-Saxons brought with them from the continent in the 5th century, and ending in 1066 with the [[Norman Conquest]] of a large Anglo-Saxon nation-state whose sophisticated art was influential in much of northern Europe.  The two periods of outstanding achievement were the 7th and 8th centuries, with the metalwork and jewellery from [[Sutton Hoo]] and a series of magnificent illuminated manuscripts, and the final period after about 950, when there was a revival of English culture after the end of the [[Viking]] invasions.  By the time of the Conquest the move to the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] style is nearly complete.  The important artistic centres, in so far as these can be established, were concentrated in the extremities of England, in [[Northumbria]], especially in the early period, and [[Wessex]] and [[Kent]] near the south coast.

Anglo-Saxon art survives mostly in [[illuminated manuscripts]], [[Anglo-Saxon architecture]], a number of very fine [[ivory]] carvings, and some works in metal and other materials. [[Opus Anglicanum]] ("English work") was already recognised as the finest embroidery in Europe, although only a few pieces from the Anglo-Saxon period remain – the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] is a rather different sort of embroidery, on a far larger scale. As in most of Europe at the time, metalwork was the most highly regarded form of art by the Anglo-Saxons, but hardly any survives – there was enormous plundering of Anglo-Saxon churches, monasteries and the possessions of the dispossessed nobility by the new Norman rulers in their first decades, as well as the Norsemen before them, and the [[English Reformation]] after them, and most survivals were once on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982)'s Chapter 1 gives a detailed analysis of the various causes of destruction of works of art, especially metalwork&lt;/ref&gt; Anglo-Saxon taste favoured brightness and colour, and an effort of the imagination is often needed to see the excavated and worn remains that survive as they once were.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 10–11; Dodwell (1982), chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best known piece of Anglo-Saxon art is the Bayeux Tapestry which was commissioned by a [[Anglo-Normans|Norman]] patron from English artists working in the traditional Anglo-Saxon style. Anglo-Saxon artists also worked in [[fresco]], [[stone carving|stone]], [[ivory carving|ivory]] and [[bone carving|whalebone]] (notably the [[Franks Casket]]), [[metalwork]] (for example the [[Fuller brooch]]), [[Anglo-Saxon glass|glass]] and [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], many examples of which have been recovered through [[archaeology|archaeological]] excavation and some of which have simply been preserved over the centuries, especially in churches on the Continent, as the [[Viking]]s, [[Normans]] and [[English Reformation|Reformation]] [[iconoclasm]] between them left virtually nothing in England except for books and archaeological finds.

==Overview==
[[File:Brit Mus 17sept 079.jpg|thumb|Bird from the Sutton Hoo shield (part replica)]]
Metalwork is almost the only form in which the earliest Anglo-Saxon art has survived, mostly in Germanic-style jewelry (including fittings for clothes and weapons) which was, before the [[Christianization of Anglo-Saxon England]], commonly placed in burials.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; After the conversion, which took most of the 7th century, the fusion of Germanic Anglo-Saxon, [[Celtic art|Celtic]] and Late Antique techniques and motifs, together with the requirement for books, created [[Hiberno-Saxon]] style, or [[Insular art]], which is also seen in illuminated manuscripts and some carved stone and ivory, probably mostly drawing from decorative metalwork motifs, and with further influences from the British Celts of the west and the [[Franks]].  The [[Kingdom of Northumbria]] in the far north of England was the crucible of Insular style in Britain, at centres such as [[Lindisfarne]], founded c. 635 as an offshoot of the [[Celtic Christianity|Irish monastery]] on [[Iona Abbey|Iona]], and [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey]] (674) which looked to the continent.  At about the same time as the Insular [[Lindisfarne Gospels]] was being made in the early 8th century, the [[Vespasian Psalter]] from [[Canterbury]] in the far south, which the missionaries from Rome had made their headquarters, shows a wholly different, classically based art. These two styles mixed and developed together and by the following century the resulting Anglo-Saxon style had reached maturity.

However Anglo-Saxon society was massively disrupted in the 9th century, especially the later half, by the [[Viking]] invasions, and the number of significant objects surviving falls considerably, and their dating becomes even vaguer than of those from a century before. Most monasteries in the north were closed for decades, if not forever, and after the [[Canterbury Bible]] of before 850, perhaps well before, "no major [[illuminated manuscript]] is known until well on into the tenth century".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 142 (quote), 60&lt;/ref&gt; [[King Alfred]] (r. 871–899) held the Vikings back to a line running diagonally across the middle of England, above which they settled in the [[Danelaw]], and were gradually integrated into what was now a unified Anglo-Saxon kingdom.  The final phase of Anglo-Saxon art is known as the Winchester School or style, though it was produced in many centres in the south of England, and perhaps the Midlands also.  Elements of this begin to be seen from around 900, but the first major manuscripts only appear around the 930s. The style combined influences from the continental art of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] with elements of older English art, and some particular elements including a nervous agitated style of drapery, sometimes matched by figures, especially in line drawings, which are the only images in many manuscripts, and were to remain especially prominent in medieval English art.

==Illuminated manuscripts==
[[File:CodexAureusCanterburyFolios9v10r.jpg|thumb|400px|left|The [[evangelist portrait]] and Incipit to Matthew from the [[Stockholm Codex Aureus]], one of the "Tiberius group", show the Northumbrian Insular and classicising continental styles that combined and competed in early Anglo-Saxon manuscripts.]] 
Early Anglo-Saxon manuscript illumination forms part of [[Insular art]], a combination of influences from Mediterranean, [[Celtic art|Celtic]] and [[Migration Period art|Germanic]] styles that arose when the Anglo-Saxons encountered Irish missionary activity in [[Northumbria]], at [[Lindisfarne]] and [[Iona]] in particular.  At the same time the [[Gregorian mission]] from Rome and its successors imported continental manuscripts like the Italian [[St. Augustine Gospels]], and for a considerable period the two styles appear mixed in a variety of proportions in Anglo-Saxon manuscripts. In the [[Lindisfarne Gospels]], of around 700–715, there are carpet pages and Insular initials of unprecedented complexity and sophistication, but the [[evangelist portrait]]s, clearly following Italian models, greatly simplify them, misunderstand some details of the setting, and give them a border with interlace corners.  The portrait of St Matthew is based on the same Italian model, or one extremely similar, used for the figure of [[Ezra]] that is one of the two large miniatures in the [[Codex Amiatinus]] (before 716), but the style there is very different; a far more illusionistic treatment, and an "attempt to introduce a pure Mediterranean style into Anglo-Saxon England", which failed, as "perhaps too advanced", leaving these images apparently as the only evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 40, 49 (quote)&lt;/ref&gt;

A different mixture is seen in the opening from the [[Stockholm Codex Aureus]] (mid-8th century, left) where the evangelist portrait to the left is in a consistent adaptation of Italian style, probably closely following some lost model, though adding interlace to the chair frame, while the text page to the right is mainly in Insular style, especially in the first line, with its vigorous Celtic spirals and interlace.  The following lines revert to a quieter style more typical of [[Franks|Frankish]] manuscripts of the period.  Yet the same artist almost certainly produced both pages, and is very confident in both styles; the evangelist portrait of John includes roundels with Celtic spiral decoration probably drawn from the enamelled escutcheons of [[hanging bowl]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Nordenfalk, 96–107, Wilson 94&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the so-called "Tiberius group" of manuscripts, which leant towards the Italian style, and appear to be associated with [[Kent]], or perhaps the kingdom of [[Mercia]] in the heyday of the [[Mercian Supremacy]].  It is, in the usual chronology, the last English manuscript in which "developed trumpet spiral patterns" are found.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 94&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Meister des Evangeliums des Grimbald 001.jpg|thumb|270px|Evangelist portrait from the [[Grimbald Gospels]], early 11th century, in the late Winchester style.]]

The 9th century, especially the latter half, has very few major survivals made in England, but was a period when Insular and Anglo-Saxon influence on [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] manuscripts was at its height, from [[scriptoria]] such as those at the [[Anglo-Saxon mission]]'s foundation at [[Abbey of Echternach|Echternach Abbey]] (though the important [[Echternach Gospels]] were created in Northumbria), and the major monastery at [[Tours]], where [[Alcuin of York]] was followed by another Anglo-Saxon abbot, between them covering the period from 796 to 834.  Although Tours' own library was destroyed by Norsemen, over 60 9th century illuminated manuscripts from the ''scriptorium'' survive, in a style showing many borrowings from English models, especially in initial pages, where Insular influence remained visible in northern France until even the 12th century. The Anglo-Saxon metalwork produced in the [[Salzburg]] area of modern [[Austria]] has a manuscript counterpart in the "Cutbercht Gospels" in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 131–133; Henderson, 63–71&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 10th century Insular elements were relegated to decorative embellishments in England, as the first phase of the "[[Winchester]] style" developed.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 90&lt;/ref&gt; The first plant ornament, with leaves and grapes, was already seen in an initial in the [[Leningrad Bede]], which can probably be dated to 746. The other large initial in the manuscript is the first [[historiated initial]] (one containing a portrait or scene, here Christ or a saint) in the whole of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 63&lt;/ref&gt; The classically derived vine or plant scroll was to largely oust interlace as the dominant filler of ornamental spaces in Anglo-Saxon art, just as it did in much of Europe beginning with [[Carolingian art]], though in England animals within the scrolls remained much more common than abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 63–67&lt;/ref&gt; For some long time scrolls, especially in metal, bone or ivory, are prone to have an animal head at one end and a plant element at the other.&lt;ref&gt;Seen by Wilson, 64–67, as "degeneration", this might also be seen as a return to the habits of [[La Tène style]].&lt;/ref&gt; All these changes were not restricted to manuscripts, and may not have been driven by manuscript style, but we have a greater number of manuscripts surviving than works in other media, even if in most cases illuminations are restricted to initials and perhaps a few miniatures.  Several ambitious projects of illumination are unfinished, such as the [[Old English Hexateuch]], which has some 550 scenes in various stages of completion, giving insight into working methods. The illustrations give Old Testament scenes an entirely contemporary setting and are valuable images of Anglo-Saxon life.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 118–120&lt;/ref&gt;

Manuscripts from the Winchester School or style only survive from about the 930s onwards; this coincided with a [[English Benedictine Reform|wave of revival and reform]] within English monasticism, encouraged by King [[Æthelstan]] (r. 924/5-939) and his successors.  Æthelstan promoted [[Dunstan]] (909–988), a practising illuminator, eventually to [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], and also [[Æthelwold of Winchester|Æthelwold]] and the French-trained Norseman [[Oswald of Worcester|Oswald]].  Illumination in a new style appears in a manuscript of the biographies by Bede of St [[Cuthbert]] given by Æthelstan to the monastery in [[Chester-le-Street]] about 937.  There is a [[dedication portrait]] of the king presenting his book to the saint, the two of them standing outside a large church.  This is the first real portrait of an English king, and heavily influenced by Carolingian style, with an elegant inhabited acanthus border.  However, the initials in the text combine Carolingian elements with animal forms in inventive fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 156–157; Dodwell (1993), 95–96&lt;/ref&gt; Miniatures added in England to the continental Aethelstan Psalter begin to show Anglo-Saxon liveliness in figure drawing in compositions derived from Carolingian and Byzantine models, and over the following decades the distinctive Winchester style with agitated draperies and elaborate acanthus borders develops.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 96–104&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Benedictional of St. Æthelwold]] is a masterpiece of the later Winchester style, which drew on Insular, Carolingian, and [[Byzantine art]] to make a heavier and more grandiose style, where the broad classicising [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] foliage sometimes seems over-luxuriant.  Anglo-Saxon illustration included many lively pen drawings, on which the Carolingian [[Utrecht Psalter]], in Canterbury from about 1000, was highly influential; the [[Harley Psalter]] is a copy of it. The [[Ramsey Psalter]] (c. 990) contains pages in both the painted and tinted drawing styles, including the first [[Beatus initial]] with a "lion mask", while the [[Tiberius Psalter]], from the last years before the Conquest, uses mainly the tinted.  Anglo-Saxon culture was coming into increasing contact with, and exchanging influences with, a wider Latin Mediaeval Europe. Anglo-Saxon drawing had a great influence in Northern France throughout the 11th century, in the so-called "Channel school", and Insular decorative elements such as [[interlace (art)|interlace]] remained popular into the 12th century in the [[Franco-Saxon]] style.

== Metalwork ==
[[File:Belt buckle.jpg|thumb|left|320px|[[Sutton Hoo]], gold and [[niello]] belt buckle]]
Pagan Anglo-Saxon metalwork initially uses the Germanic [[Animal Style]] I and II decoration that would be expected from recent immigrants, but gradually develops a distinctive Anglo-Saxon character, as in the [[Quoit Brooch Style]] of the 5th century. Round disk brooches were preferred for the grandest pieces, over continental styles of ''[[Fibula (brooch)|fibulae]]'' and Romano-British [[penannular brooch]]es, a consistent Anglo-Saxon taste throughout the period; the [[Harford Farm Brooch]] is a 7th-century example.  Decoration included [[cloisonné]] ("cellwork"), in gold and [[garnet]] for high-status pieces.  Despite a considerable number of other finds, the discovery of the ship-burial at [[Sutton Hoo]], probably interred in the 620s, transformed the history of Anglo-Saxon art, showing a level of sophistication and quality that was wholly unexpected at this date.  The most famous finds are the [[Sutton Hoo helmet|helmet]] and matching suite of [[Sutton Hoo purse-lid|purse-lid]], belt and other fittings of the king buried there, which made clear the source in Anglo-Saxon art, previously much disputed, of many elements of the style of Insular manuscripts.        
[[File:Brit Mus Fuller Brooch.jpg|thumb|The [[Fuller Brooch]]]]

By the 10th century Anglo-Saxon metalwork had a famous reputation as far afield as Italy, where English goldsmiths worked on plate for the altar of [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St Peter's]] itself,&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 135 for St Peter's; Dodwell (1982) as next ref. for the reputation.&lt;/ref&gt; but hardly any pieces have survived the depredations of the [[Norman Conquest]] in 1066, and the [[English Reformation]], and none of the large-scale ones, shrines, doors and statues, that we know existed, and of which a few contemporary continental examples have survived.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982):10–11, 44–47, 61–83, 216ff&lt;/ref&gt; The references to specific works by the 11th century monastic artist [[Spearhafoc]], none of which have identifiably survived, are about works in precious metal, and he is one of a small number of metalwork artists from the period whose name we know and whose work is described in any way. According to several sources, including the [[Normans|Norman]] chronicler [[Goscelin]], who knew him personally, Spearhafoc "was outstanding in painting, gold-engraving and goldsmithery", the painting very likely mainly in [[illuminated manuscript]]s. It was probably his artistic work which brought into contact with the royal family, and launched his rapid promotion in the church.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982):46 and 55, who quotes Goscelin, and Historia:ciii-cv for the other sources.&lt;/ref&gt; Even the imprecise details given, mostly by Goscelin, are therefore valuable evidence of what Anglo-Saxon metalwork was like. Anglo-Saxon skill in gold-engraving, designs and figures engraved on gold objects, is mentioned by many foreign sources, and the few remaining engraved figures closely parallel the far more numerous pen-drawn figures in manuscripts, also an Anglo-Saxon speciality. Wall-paintings, which seem to have sometimes contained gold, were also apparently often made by manuscript illuminators, and Goscelin's description of his talents therefore suggests an artist skilled in all the main Anglo-Saxon media for figurative art – of which being a goldsmith was then regarded as the most prestigious branch.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982):58, 79–83, 92–3&lt;/ref&gt; One 11th century lay goldsmith was even a ''[[thegn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 14&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Brit Mus 17sept 005-crop.jpg|thumb|left|Brooch from the [[Pentney Hoard]], in the Trewhiddle style.]]

Many monastic artists reached senior positions; Spearhafoc's career in metalwork was paralleled in less sensational fashion by his contemporary [[Mannig]], [[Abbot of Evesham]] (Abbot 1044–58, d. 1066),&lt;ref&gt;See Dodwell (1982), passim&lt;/ref&gt; and at the end of the previous century Saint [[Dunstan]] had been a very successful Archbishop of Canterbury. Like Spearhafoc, Mannig's biography, with some precise details, is given in the chronicle maintained by his abbey.&lt;ref&gt;Gransden:65. History&lt;/ref&gt; His work also had a miracle associated with it – the lay goldsmith Godric stabbed his hand with an [[scratch awl|awl]] during the work on the large shrine at Evesham, which was miraculously healed overnight.&lt;ref&gt;History:159 and Dodwell (1982):65–66&lt;/ref&gt; Spearhafoc and Mannig are the "only two goldsmiths of whom we have extended accounts", and the additional information given about Godric, the leader of a team brought in by Mannig for the shrine, is also unique among the surviving evidence. Some twenty years after the miracle, he joined the Abbey of Evesham, presumably in retirement, and his son later became [[Prior]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982):48, 80 and 65–67&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final century of the period some large figures in precious metal are recorded; presumably these were made of thin sheets over a wooden core like the [[Golden Madonna of Essen]], the largest example of this type of Early Medieval figure to survive from anywhere in Europe. These appear to have been life-size, or nearly so, and were mostly [[crucifix]]es, sometimes with figures of Mary and [[John the Evangelist]] on either side. Patronage by the great figures of the land, and the largest monasteries, became extravagant in this period, and the greatest late Anglo-Saxon churches must have presented a dazzling spectacle, somewhat in the style of [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches. Anglo-Saxon taste revelled in expensive materials and the effects of light on precious metals, which were also embroidered into fabrics and used on wall-paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; Sections of decorated elements from some large looted works such as reliquaries were sawn up by Viking raiders and taken home to their wives to wear as jewellery, and a number of these survive in Scandinavian museums.

While larger works are all lost, several small objects and fragments have survived, nearly all having been buried; in recent decades professional archaeology as well as [[metal-detecting]] and deep ploughing have greatly increased the number of objects known.  Among the few unburied exceptions are the secular [[Fuller Brooch]], and two works made in Anglo-Saxon style carried to Austria by the [[Anglo-Saxon mission]], the [[Tassilo Chalice]] (late 8th century) and the [[Rupertus Cross]].  Especially in the 9th century, Anglo-Saxon styles, sometimes derived from manuscripts rather than metal examples, are found in a great number of smaller pieces of jewellery and other small fittings from across northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 9, 133–137&lt;/ref&gt; From England itself, the [[Alfred Jewel]], with an enamel face, is the best known of a group of finely worked liturgical jewels, and there are a number of high quality disk brooches.  The most ornate of earlier ones are colourful and complicated with inlays and filigrees, but the 9th century [[Pentney Hoard]], discovered in 1978, contained six splendid brooches in flat silver openwork in the "[[Trewhiddle]] style".  In these small but fully formed animals, of no recognisable species, contort themselves in foliage and tendrils that interlace, but without the emphatic geometry of the earlier "ribbon" style.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/s/pentney_hoard_brooches.aspx British Museum] Six disc brooches from the Pentney hoard&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ædwen's brooch]], an 11th-century [[Anglo-Scandinavian]] silver disk brooch, shows influence from [[Viking art]], and a fall-off from the highest earlier standards of workmanship.

In 2009 the [[Staffordshire hoard]], a major hoard of over 1,500 fragments of 7th and ?8th century metalwork pieces, mostly gold and military in nature, many with gold and garnet cloisonné inlays of high quality, was found by a metal-detectorist in [[Staffordshire]], then in Mercia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/highlights-of-anglosaxon-hoard-1792388.html Highlights of Anglo-Saxon hoard], [[The Independent]], 24 September 2009, (retrieved 24 September 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Jewellery is far more often found from burials of the early pagan period, as Christianity discouraged grave-goods, even including the personal possessions of the deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 12&lt;/ref&gt; Early Anglo-Saxon jewellery includes various types of ''fibulae'' that are close to their Continental Germanic equivalents, but until [[Sutton Hoo]] rarely of outstanding quality, which is why that find transformed thinking about early Anglo-Saxon art.

The earliest Anglo-Saxon coin type, the silver ''[[sceat]]'', forced craftsmen, no doubt asked to copy Roman and contemporary continental styles, to work outside their traditional forms and conventions in respect of the heads on the [[obverse]], with results that are varied and often compelling.  Later silver [[Penny (English coin)|pennies]], with largely linear relief heads of kings in profile on the obverse, are more uniform, as representatives of what was a stable and respected currency by contemporary European standards.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, 170–171&lt;/ref&gt; A number of complete ''[[seax]]'' knives have survived with inscriptions and some decoration, and sword fittings and other military pieces are an important form of jewellery.  A treatise on social status needed to say that mere ownership of a gilded sword did not make a man a ''[[ceorle]]'', the lowest rank of free men.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), 190&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monumental sculpture and wall painting==
[[File:The 7th C Bewcastle Cross - geograph.org.uk - 1833413.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Bewcastle Cross]] ([[:File:The 7th C Bewcastle Cross (2) - geograph.org.uk - 1833421.jpg|alternative view]])]]
Apart from [[Anglo-Saxon architecture]], which survives entirely in churches, with only a handful of largely unaltered examples, monumental stone sculpture survives in large stone crosses, an equivalent to the [[high cross]]es of the Celtic areas of Britain. Most sculpture was probably once painted, clarifying the designs, which are mostly in relatively low relief and not finished with great precision, and now almost all badly worn and weathered.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 152 and passim.&lt;/ref&gt; Dating is usually difficult.  Sculpture in wood was very likely more common, but almost the only significant large survival is [[St Cuthbert's coffin]] in [[Durham Cathedral]], probably made in 698, with numerous linear images carved or incised in a technique that is a sort of large-scale engraving.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 50–53&lt;/ref&gt; The material of the earliest recorded crosses is unknown, but may well have been wood. From various references (to its destruction by Christians) there would seem to have been a tradition of Anglo-Saxon pagan monumental sculpture, probably in wood, of which no examples remain (as opposed to later [[Anglo-Scandinavian]] pagan imagery),&lt;ref&gt;No unmixed examples, that is to say. Scenes from Germanic mythology still appear in works of the Christian period, as in the Franks Casket and Gosforth Cross.&lt;/ref&gt; and with which the crosses initially competed.

The Anglo-Saxon crosses have survived less well than those in Ireland, being more subject to [[iconoclasm]] after the [[English Reformation]]. Some featured large figurative sculpture of considerable quality, as on the [[Ruthwell Cross]] and [[Bewcastle Cross]] (both probably around 800). Vine-scroll decoration and [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]] are seen in alternating panels on the early Northumbrian Ruthwell, Bewcastle and [[Easby Cross]]es, though the vine-scroll is already more prominent, and has faces to itself. Later [[Southumbria]]n crosses often only use vine-scrolls.  There may be inscriptions, in the runic or Roman scripts, and Latin or [[Old English]], most famously at Ruthwell, where some of the poem the ''[[Dream of the Rood]]'' is inscribed together with Latin texts; more often donors are commemorated. It has also been suggested that as well as paint, they may have been embellished with metalwork and gems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandbach.gov.uk/Guide/Crosses.htm Sanbach crosses]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Typically, Anglo-Saxon crosses are tall and slender compared to Irish examples, many with a nearly square section, and more space given to ornament than figures.  However, there are exceptions, like the massive [[Sandbach Crosses]] from Mercia, with oblong sections mostly covered by figures on the wider faces, like some Irish crosses.  The [[Gosforth Cross]], of 930–950, is a rare example to survive complete; most survivals are only a section of the shaft, and iconoclasts were more concerned to destroy imagery than ornament.  Many crosses must have just fallen over after some centuries; headpieces are the least common survivals, and the Easby Cross was repaired with lead in a way described in early documents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O93731/stone-carving-the-easby-cross/ V&amp;A Museum], Easby Cross, A.88–1930&lt;/ref&gt; Like many monuments from the area of the [[Danelaw]], the Gosforth Cross combines Christian images with those from pagan mythology; apart from a Crucifixion scene, and perhaps scenes of the [[Last Judgment|Last Judgement]], all the other images appear to belong to the Norse myth of ''[[Ragnarök]]'', the destruction of the gods, a theme detected in other Christian monuments in Britain and Scandinavia, and which could be turned to Christian advantage.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, 18–22; Wilson, 150&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[File:St Oswald's Priory Anglo-Saxon cross.jpg|thumb|Fragment of cross shaft from [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester]]; at right with added, but perhaps not inauthentic, colour.]]

Anglo-Scandinavians took up Anglo-Saxon sculptural forms with great enthusiasm, and in Yorkshire alone there are fragments from more than 500 monumental sculptures of the 10th and 11th centuries.  However quantity was not matched by quality, and even the products of the main city, York, are described by [[David M. Wilson]] as "generally miserable and slipshod".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 142–152; 142 "more than 500; 144 (quote)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages the successive styles of [[Norse art]] appear in England, but gradually as political and cultural ties weakened the Anglo-Scandinavians fail to keep up with trends in the homeland. So elements of the [[Borre style]] are seen, for example in the "ring-chain" interlace on the Gosforth Cross, and then the complex animals of the [[Jelling style]] are mostly rather incompetently depicted in England, but traces of the next [[Mammen style]] are hard to detect; they are much clearer on the [[Isle of Man]].  They are "perhaps, dimly" evident in the cross shaft from [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester]] (illustrated right).  In general the traces of these styles in other media are even fainter.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 142–149, quote 147&lt;/ref&gt; A uniquely Anglo-Scandinavian form is the [[Hogback (sculpture)|hogback]], low grave-marker shaped like a long house with a pitched roof, and sometimes muzzled bears clutching on to each end.  Ornament is sometimes a crude pattern of scoring, or scale-like elements presumably representing roofing shingles, but may include interlace and images.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 149; Laing's typology is shown in 3 pages of drawings [http://www.dur.ac.uk/sculpturecorpus/Corpus_Website_Main_Folder/grammar_pages/Chapter2/Hogbacks.htm here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015224136/http://www.dur.ac.uk/sculpturecorpus/Corpus_Website_Main_Folder/grammar_pages/Chapter2/Hogbacks.htm |date=15 October 2012 }} from the ''AS Sculpture Corpus'' website; [http://www.nrk.no/kanal/nrk_p2/1.6781563 photo of good examples from Brompton, Yorkshire]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many fragments, parts of friezes and panels with figure and ornamental carving, have been recovered by archaeology, usually after being reused in rebuilt churches.  The largest group of Anglo-Saxon sculpture is from a former abbey at [[Breedon-on-the-Hill]] in Mercia, with a number of elements of different dates, including lively narrow decorative strip friezes, many including human figures, and panels with saints and the Virgin.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; The most intriguing fragments are firstly a group, now at [[Canterbury Cathedral]], from [[St Mary's Church, Reculver]], in Kent, from a large composition with many figure scenes and groups on a curved surface, evidently of high quality, though uncertain date (perhaps early 10th century).  A ''Sacrifice of Isaac'' and an ''Ascension'' can be identified, and parts of standing groups of saints, prophets or apostles.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, 40–41; Wilson, 70–72&lt;/ref&gt;

Standing equally apart from other survivals is a late slab from the [[Old Minster, Winchester]] which appears to show a section of a large frieze with the story from Germanic mythology of [[Sigmund]], which it has been suggested may have been as long as eighty feet wide, and over four feet high.  There are literary references to secular narrative tapestries, a tradition of which the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] is the only survival, and this may have been a stone equivalent, celebrating Sigmund, who was believed to be an ancestor of the intermarried royal houses of both England and [[Denmark]], many of whom were buried in what was then the largest church in England.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, 133–134; Dodwell (1982), 137–138; Henderson, 171–173&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also clear from literary sources that wall paintings were not uncommon, although not a prestigious form, and fragments of painted plaster have been found, as well as a painted face on a reused stone at [[Winchester]], dating to before 903, and so an important early example of the Winchester figure style.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), 92–93; Wilson, 10–13, 155; Golden Age, 44&lt;/ref&gt; A metaphor in a letter of [[Alcuin]] speaks of "stars, like the painted ceiling of a great man's house".&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 131&lt;/ref&gt; However, no paintings that are at all complete have survived on either wall or panel.

==Ivory carving==
[[File:Brit Mus 17sept 010-crop.jpg|thumb|310px|Head of a [[tau cross]], with ''[[Christ Treading on the Beasts]]'', an especially popular subject in England]]
As in the rest of the Christian world, while monumental sculpture was slowly re-emerging from its virtual absence in the Early Christian period, small-scale sculpture in metalwork, [[ivory carving]] and also [[bone carving]] was more important than in later periods, and by no means a "minor art".  Most Anglo-Saxon ivory was from marine animals, especially the [[walrus]], imported from further north. The extraordinary early [[Franks Casket]] is carved from [[whalebone]], which a [[riddle]] on it alludes to. It contains a unique mixture of pagan, historical and Christian scenes, evidently attempting to cover a general history of the world, and inscriptions in [[rune]]s in both Latin and [[Old English]]. We have few Anglo-Saxon panels from book-covers compared to those from [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]] but a number of figures of very high quality in high relief or fully in the round.  In the last phase of Anglo-Saxon art two styles are apparent: one a heavier and formal one drawing from Carolingian and Ottonian sources, and the other the Winchester style, drawing from the [[Utrecht Psalter]] and an alternative Carolingian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, 88&lt;/ref&gt; A very late [[buxus|boxwood]] casket, now in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], is carved all over with scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ]]'' in a provincial but accomplished version of the Winchester style, possibly originating in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]], and is a unique survival of late Anglo-Saxon fine wood carving.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, 125–126;[http://www.clevelandart.org/collections/collection%20online.aspx?pid={91ADCD8F-992A-45A5-8599-70835467DF5E}&amp;coid=5870087&amp;clabel=highlights Cleveland Museum of Art], Accession No.: 1953.362&lt;/ref&gt;

==Textile art==
[[File:Fleeing bayeux tapestry.png|thumb|left|The English army flee, the final surviving scene of the [[Bayeux Tapestry]].]]   
The textile arts of embroidery and "tapestry", ''[[Opus anglicanum]]'', were apparently those for which Anglo-Saxon England was famous throughout Europe by the end of the period, but there are only a handful of survivals, probably partly because of the Anglo-Saxon love of using threads in precious metal, making the work valuable for scrap.  

The [[Bayeux Tapestry]] is embroidered in wool on [[linen]] and shows the story of the [[Norman conquest of England]]; it is surely the best known Anglo-Saxon work of art, and though made after the Conquest was both made in England and firmly in an Anglo-Saxon tradition, points now accepted by French art-historians.&lt;ref&gt;Golden Age, 195; Dodwell (1982), 138–139. However a number of fringe theories persist – see the article. See also Henderson, 168–177 for an extended appreciation.&lt;/ref&gt; Such tapestries adorned both churches and wealthy houses in England, though at 0.5 by 68.38 metres (1.6 by 224.3&amp;nbsp;ft, and apparently incomplete) the Bayeux Tapestry must be exceptionally large.  Only the figures and decoration are embroidered, on a background left plain, which shows the subject very clearly and was necessary to cover very large areas. All kinds of textile arts were produced by women, both nuns and laywomen, but many were probably designed by artists in other media. [[Byzantine silk]]s were available, though certainly expensive, in Anglo-Saxon England, and a number of pieces have been found used in burials and reliquaries.  Probably, as in later vestments, these were often married with locally embroidered borders and panels. If we had more Anglo-Saxon survivals, Byzantine influences would no doubt be apparent.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), Chapter V; Dodwell (1993), Chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The most highly valued embroideries were very different, fully worked in silk and gold of silver thread, and sometimes with gems of various sorts sewn in. These were used for vestments, altar-cloths and other church uses, and similar roles in the homes of the elite. Only a few pieces have survived, including three pieces at Durham placed in the coffin of St Cuthbert, probably in the 930s, after being given by [[King Athelstan]]; they were made in Winchester between 909 and 916. These are works "of breathtaking brilliance and quality", according to Wilson, including figures of saints, and important early examples of the Winchester style, though the origin of their style is a puzzle; they are closest to the wall-painting fragment from Winchester mentioned above, and an early example of acanthus decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 154–156, quote 155; Dodwell (1993), 26; Golden Age, 19, 44, though neither these nor any textiles could be lent for the exhibition; [https://trc-leiden.nl/trc-needles/individual-textiles-and-textile-types/religious-vestments-and-other-textiles/st-cuthbert-embroideries St. Cuthbert Embroideries], from Textile Research Centre, Leiden&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earliest group of survivals, now re-arranged and with the precious metal thread mostly picked out, are bands or borders from vestments, incorporating pearls and glass beads, with various types of scroll and animal decoration. These are probably 9th century and now in a church in [[Maaseik]] in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 108; Dodwell (1993), 27, who gives details of further fragments.&lt;/ref&gt; A further style of textile is a vestment illustrated in a miniature portrait of [[Saint Aethelwold]] in his Benedictional (see above), which shows the edge of what appears to be a huge acanthus "flower" (a term used in several documentary records) covering the wearer's back and shoulders.  Other written sources mention other large-scale compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), 183–185; [http://img49.imageshack.us/img49/5295/benedictional1am1.jpg portrait of Saint Aethelwold]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other materials==
[[File:Claw beaker from Ringmere Farm BM 2005.12-5.1.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Claw beaker]] in glass]]
[[Anglo-Saxon glass]] was mostly made in simple forms, with vessels always in a single colour, either clear, green or brown, but some fancy [[claw beaker]]s decorated with large "claw" forms have survived, mostly broken; these forms are also found in northern continental Europe.  Beads, common in early female burials, and some ecclesiastical window glass was more brightly coloured, and several monastic sites have evidence of glass production.  Vessel and bead production probably continued, at a much lower level, from the Romano-British industry, but Bede records that [[Benedict Biscop]] brought glass-makers from [[Gaul]] for window glass at his monasteries.  It is not clear how much Anglo-Saxon glass was imported, but canes of [[millefiori]] coloured glass almost certainly were; one of these was in the purse at Sutton Hoo.  Otherwise recycling of Roman glass may have avoided the need to import raw glass; evidence for the production of this is slender.  Glass is sometimes used as a substitute for garnet in jewellery, as in some pieces from Sutton Hoo. [[Vitreous enamel|Enamel]] was used, most famously in the [[Alfred Jewel]], where the image sits under carved [[rock crystal]], both materials are extremely rare in surviving Anglo-Saxon work.

The unique decorated leather cover of the small Northumbrian [[St Cuthbert Gospel]], the oldest Western [[bookbinding]] to survive unaltered, can be dated to 698 or shortly before.  It uses incised lines, some colours, and relief decoration built up over cord and [[gesso]] or leather pieces. Larger prestige manuscripts had metalwork [[treasure binding]]s, several of which are mentioned, but there may well have been much decorated leatherwork for secular satchels, purses, belts and the like, which contemporaries did not bother to mention and which represents a gap in our knowledge for the Early Medieval period throughout Europe.

==Aftermath==
[[File:The St Cuthbert Gospel of St John. (formerly known as the Stonyhurst Gospel) is the oldest intact European book. - Upper cover (Add Ms 89000) (cropped).jpg|thumb|250px|left|The front cover of the [[St Cuthbert Gospel]], 690s; the original tooled red goatskin binding is the earliest surviving Western [[bookbinding]]]]

Relatively little art survives from the rest of the century after 1066, or at least is confidently dated to that period.  The art of Normandy was already under heavy Anglo-Saxon influence, but the period was one of massive despoliation of the churches by the small new ruling class, who had almost entirely dispossessed the old Anglo-Saxon elite. Under these circumstances little significant art was produced, but when it was, the style often showed a slow development of Anglo-Saxon styles into a fully Romanesque version.&lt;ref&gt;Zarnecki, 17–23, 83–84, 232&lt;/ref&gt; The attribution of many individual objects has jumped around across the boundary of the Norman Conquest, especially for sculpture, including ivories. A number of objects are claimed for their period by both the "Golden Age of Anglo-Saxon Art" and the "English Romanesque art: 1066–1200" exhibition catalogues, despite both being published in 1984.  These include the ivory triangle mount with angels and the "Sigurd" stone relief fragment (discussed above), both from Winchester, and the ivory "pen-case" and ''Baptism'' (illustrated above), both in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Respectively numbers: Golden Age: 114, 140, 132, 117, and Zarnecki: 190, 97, 185, 180.  There are many other examples.&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy, love of complicated twining ornament, and refusal to wholly respect a dignified classical decorum that are displayed in both Insular and Winchester school art had already influenced continental style, as discussed above, where it provided an alternative to the heavy monumentality that [[Ottonian art]] displays even in small objects.  This habit of mind was an essential component of both the Romanesque and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] styles, where forms of Anglo-Saxon invention such as the inhabited and historiated initials became more important than they ever had in Anglo-Saxon art itself, and works like the [[Gloucester Candlestick]] (c. 1110) show the process in other media.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, 63–71&lt;/ref&gt;

Anglo-Saxon [[iconography|iconographical]] innovations include the animal [[Hellmouth]], the [[Ascension of Christ|ascending Christ]] shown only as a pair of legs and feet disappearing at the top of the image, the horned [[Moses]], St [[John the Evangelist]] standing at the foot of the cross and writing, and [[God the Father]] creating the world with a [[pair of compasses]].  All of these were later used across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 117&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest developed depiction of the ''[[Last Judgement]]'' in the West is also found on an Anglo-Saxon ivory, and a late Anglo-Saxon Gospel book may show the earliest example of [[Mary Magdalene]] at the foot of the cross in a ''Crucifixion''.&lt;ref&gt;It is the earliest cited by Schiller, II, 117&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Art for art's sake'''" is the usual [[English language|English]] rendering of a [[French language|French]] [[slogan]] from the early 19th century, "'''''l'art pour l'art'''''", and expresses a philosophy that the intrinsic value of art, and the only "true" art, is divorced from any [[didactic]], moral, or utilitarian function. Such works are sometimes described as "[[autotelic]]", from the Greek ''autoteles'', "complete in itself", a concept that has been expanded to embrace "inner-directed" or "self-motivated" human beings.

The term is sometimes used commercially. A Latin version of this phrase ("'''''ARS GRATIA ARTIS'''''") is used as a motto by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and appears in the circle around the roaring head of [[Leo the Lion (MGM)|Leo the Lion]] in its [[motion picture]] logo. &lt;!--Also, Delta House from the movie National Lampoon's Animal House use it as their motto, as can be seen on their fraternity flag.--&gt;

==History==
"''L'art pour l'art''" (translated as "art for art's sake") is credited to [[Théophile Gautier]] (1811–1872), who was the first to adopt the phrase as a slogan in the preface to his 1835 book, ''Mademoiselle de Maupin''. Gautier was not, however, the first to write those words: they appear in the works of [[Victor Cousin]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9125149/art-for-arts-sake retrieved 23 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Constant]], and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. For example, Poe argues in his essay "[[The Poetic Principle]]" (1850):

&lt;blockquote&gt;We have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poem's sake [...] and to acknowledge such to have been our design, would be to confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and force: – but the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor can exist any work more thoroughly dignified, more supremely noble, than this very poem, this poem per se, this poem which is a poem and nothing more, '''this poem written solely for the poem's sake'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

"Art for art's sake" was a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] [[creed]] in the nineteenth century, a slogan raised in defiance of those who – from [[John Ruskin]] to the much later [[Communism|Communist]] advocates of [[socialist realism]] – thought that the value of art was to serve some [[moral]] or [[Didacticism|didactic]] purpose. "Art for art's sake" affirmed that art was valuable ''as'' art, that artistic pursuits were their own justification and that art did not need moral justification – and indeed, was allowed to be morally neutral or subversive.

In fact, [[James McNeill Whistler]] wrote the following in which he discarded the accustomed role of art in the service of the state or official religion, which had adhered to its practice since the [[Counter-Reformation]] of the sixteenth century: "Art should be independent of all claptrap – should stand alone [...] and appeal to the artistic sense of eye or ear, without confounding this with emotions entirely foreign to it, as devotion, pity, love, patriotism and the like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Such a brusque dismissal also expressed the artist's distancing himself from [[Sentimentality|sentimentalism]]. All that remains of [[Romanticism]] in this statement is the reliance on the artist's own eye and sensibility as the arbiter.

The explicit slogan is associated in the history of English art and letters with [[Walter Pater]] and his followers in the [[aestheticism|Aesthetic Movement]], which was self-consciously in rebellion against [[Victorian Era|Victorian]] moralism. It first appeared in English in two works published simultaneously in 1868: Pater's review of [[William Morris]]'s poetry in the ''[[Westminster Review]]'' and in ''[[William Blake]]'' by [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]. A modified form of Pater's review appeared in his ''Studies in the History of the Renaissance'' (1873), one of the most influential texts of the Aesthetic Movement.

In Germany, the poet [[Stefan George]] was one of the first artists to translate the phrase ("''Kunst für die Kunst''") and adopt it for his own literary programme which he presented in the first volume of his literary magazine ''Blätter für die Kunst'' (1892). He was inspired mainly by [[Charles Baudelaire]] and the French [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]] whom he had met in Paris, where he was friends with Albert Saint-Paul and consorted with the circle around [[Stéphane Mallarmé]].

==Criticism==

[[George Sand]] wrote in 1872 that ''L'art pour l'art'' was an empty phrase, an idle sentence. She asserted that artists had a "duty to find an adequate expression to convey it to as many souls as possible," ensuring that their works were accessible enough to be appreciated.&lt;ref&gt;Letters of George Sand, Vol 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] claimed that there is no art for art’s sake:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the purpose of moral preaching and of improving man has been excluded from art, it still does not follow by any means that art is altogether purposeless, aimless, senseless — in short, ''l'art pour l'art'', a worm chewing its own tail. "Rather no purpose at all than a moral purpose!" — that is the talk of mere passion. A psychologist, on the other hand, asks: what does all art do? does it not praise? glorify? choose? prefer? With all this it strengthens or weakens certain valuations. Is this merely a "moreover"? an accident? something in which the artist's instinct had no share? Or is it not the very presupposition of the artist's ability? Does his basic instinct aim at art, or rather at the sense of art, at life? at a desirability of life? Art is the great stimulus to life: how could one understand it as purposeless, as aimless, as ''l'art pour l'art''?&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'', “Skirmishes of an Untimely Man,” §24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Contemporary [[postcolonial]] African writers such as [[Leopold Senghor]] and [[Chinua Achebe]] have criticised the slogan as being a limited and Eurocentric view on art and creation. In "Black African Aesthetics," Senghor argues that "art is functional" and that "in black Africa, 'art for art's sake' does not exist." Achebe is more scathing in his collection of essays and criticism entitled ''Morning Yet on Creation Day'', where he asserts that "art for art's sake is just another piece of deodorised dog shit" (sic).&lt;ref&gt;Achebe, Chinua. ''Morning Yet on Creation Day''. Michigan: Heinemann Educational, 1975. Page 19. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter Benjamin]] discusses the slogan in his seminal 1936 essay "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]." He first mentions it in regard to the reaction within the realm of traditional art to innovations in reproduction, in particular [[photography]]. He even terms the "L'art pour l'art" slogan as part of a "[[theology]] of art" in bracketing off social aspects. In the Epilogue to the essay Benjamin discusses the links between [[fascism]] and art. His main example is that of [[Futurism]] and the thinking of its mentor [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]]. One of the slogans of the Futurists was "Fiat ars - pereat mundus" ("Let art be created, though the world perish"). Provocatively, Benjamin concludes that as long as fascism expects war "to supply the artistic gratification of a sense of perception that has been changed by technology," then this is the "consummation," the realization, of "L'art pour l'art."&lt;ref&gt;Walter Benjamin, "The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction," in ''Illuminations'', Fontana Press, London, 1973, 23. {{ISBN|0-00-686248-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diego Rivera]] claims that the "art for art's sake" theory would further divide the rich from the poor. Rivera goes on to say that since one of the characteristics of so called "pure art" was that it could only be appreciated by a few superior people, the art movement would strip art from its value as a social tool and ultimately make art into a currency-like item that would only be available to the rich. &lt;ref&gt;http://photo-soup.org/wp2013/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Rivera-Diego-The-revolutionary-spirit-in-modern-art.pdf; pg.52&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] said: "There is in fact no such thing as art for art's sake, art that stands above classes, art that is detached from or independent of politics. [[Proletarian]] literature and art are part of the whole proletarian revolutionary cause; they are, as [[Lenin]] said, cogs and wheels in the whole revolutionary machine."&lt;ref&gt;"Talks at the Yenan Forum on Literature and Art" (May 1942), ''Selected Works'', Vol. III, p. 86. Via ''[[Quotations of Chairman Mao Zedong]]'', accessed via the [[Marxists Internet Archive]] [https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/mao/works/red-book/ch32.htm here].&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''auxochrome''' (from [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|αὐξάνω}} ''auxanō'' "increase" and {{wikt-lang|grc|χρῶμα}} ''chrōma'' "colour") is a group of atoms attached to a [[chromophore]] which modifies the ability of that chromophore to [[Absorption (light)|absorb light]]. They themselves fail to produce the colour; but when present along with the chromophores in an organic compound intensifies the colour of the [[chromogen]].&lt;ref name="Prince"&gt;{{cite book | title=Principles of Organic Chemistry | publisher=Jai Sai Publications | first=M. | last=Vishwanathan | location=Kollam, Kerala | page=2/30}}{{ISBN missing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[hydroxyl group]] (−OH), the [[amino group]] (−NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), the [[aldehyde]] group (−CHO), and the [[methyl mercaptan]] group (−SCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gronowitz|first=Salo J. O.|journal=Arkiv för Kemi|volume=27|page=239|date=1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An auxochrome is a [[functional group]] of atoms with one or more [[lone pair]]s of electrons when attached to a chromophore, alters both the [[wavelength]] and intensity of [[Absorption (light)|absorption]]. If these groups are in direct [[Conjugation (organic chemistry)|conjugation]] with the [[Pi-bond|pi]]-system of the chromophore, they may increase the wavelength at which the light is absorbed and as a result intensify the absorption. A feature of these auxochromes is the presence of at least one [[lone pair]] of electrons which can be viewed as extending the conjugated system by [[Resonance (chemistry)|resonance]].

==Effects on chromophore==

It increases the color of any [[organic compound]]. For example, [[benzene]] does not display color as it does not have a chromophore; but [[nitrobenzene]] is pale yellow color because of the presence of a [[nitro group]] (−NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) which acts as a chromophore. But [[p-Nitrophenol|''p''-hydroxynitrobenzene]] exhibits a deep yellow color, in which the [[hydroxyl|−OH]] group acts as an auxochrome. Here the auxochrome (−OH) is conjugated with the chromophore −NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Similar behavior is seen in [[azobenzene]] which has a red color, but [[p-Hydroxyazobenzene|''p''-hydroxyazobenzene]] is dark red in color.

The presence of an auxochrome in the [[chromogen]] molecule is essential to make a [[dye]]. However, if an auxochrome is present in the meta position to the chromophore, it does not affect the color.

An auxochrome is known as a compound that produces a [[bathochromic shift]], also known as red shift because it increases the wavelength of absorption, therefore moving closer to [[infrared light]]. [[Woodward's rules|Woodward−Fieser rules]] estimate the shift in wavelength of maximum absorption for several auxochromes attached to a [[conjugated system]] in an organic molecule.

An auxochrome helps a dye to bind to the object that is to be colored.  [[Electrolytic dissociation]] of the auxochrome group helps in binding and it is due to this reason a [[base (chemistry)|basic]] substance takes an [[acid]]ic dye.

==Explanation for the colour modification==
A molecule exhibits colour because it absorbs colours only of certain frequencies and reflects or transmits others. They are capable of absorbing and emitting light of various frequencies. Light waves with frequency very close to their [[natural frequency]] are absorbed readily. This phenomenon, known as [[resonance]], means that the molecule can absorb radiation of a particular frequency which is same as the frequency of electron movement within the molecule. The chromophore is the part of the molecule where the energy difference between two different [[molecular orbitals]] falls within the range of the [[visible spectrum]] and hence absorbs some particular colours from visible light. Hence the molecule appears coloured. When auxochromes are attached to the molecule, the natural frequency of the chromophore gets changed and thus the colour gets modified. Different auxochromes produce different effects in the chromophore which in turn causes absorption of light from other parts of the spectrum. Normally, auxochromes which intensify the colour are chosen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Dye Spectrum | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TaGZ6a_ZXEcC&amp;pg=PA52-IA2&amp;dq=Chromophore+intitle:New+intitle:Scientist&amp;hl=ml#v=onepage&amp;q=Chromophore&amp;intitle%3ANew&amp;intitle%3AScientist&amp;f=false | journal=New Scientist |date=May 1989 | volume=122 | issue=1665 | pages=52 | ISSN=0262-4079 | publisher=Reed Business Information}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==

There are mainly two types of auxochromes:

* [[Acid]]ic: [[Carboxyl|−COOH]], [[Hydroxyl|−OH]], [[Sulfonate|−SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H]]
* [[Base (chemistry)|Basic]]: [[Amino group|−NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[Secondary amine|−NHR]], [[Tertiary amine|−NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

[[File:Libros 2013 001.jpg|thumb|Cluttered bookshelf, one symptom of bibliomania]]
'''Bibliomania''' can be a symptom of [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] which involves the [[Book collecting|collecting]] or even [[Compulsive hoarding|hoarding]] of [[book]]s to the point where social relations or health are damaged.

Bibliomania is not to be confused with [[bibliophilia]], which is the usual love of books and is not considered a clinical psychological disorder.

==Description==
One of several unusual behaviors associated with books, bibliomania is characterized by the collecting of books which have no use to the collector nor any great intrinsic value to a genuine book collector. The purchase of multiple copies of the same book and edition and the accumulation of books beyond possible capacity of use or enjoyment are frequent symptoms of bibliomania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/in-excess/201309/hooked-and-booked|title=Hooked and Booked|website=Psychology Today|language=en|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bibliomania is not a psychological disorder recognized by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] in its DSM-IV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.inlifehealthcare.com/2015/09/09/a-detailed-study-about-bibliomania/|title=A Detailed Study About Bibliomania|last=Agrawal|first=Mukta|date=2015-09-09|website=InlifeHealthCare|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was coined by [[John Ferriar]] (1761–1815), a physician at the Manchester Royal Infirmary.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, Joshua. ''The man who made lists: love, death, madness, and the creation of [[Roget's Thesaurus]]'', Penguin Group, USA, 2008, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; Ferriar coined the term in 1809 in a poem he dedicated to his bibliomanic friend, [[Richard Heber]] (1773–1833).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferriar|first=John|title=The Bibliomania, An Epistle to Richard Heber, Esq.|year=1809|publisher=T. Cadell and W. Davies, in the Strand; J.

In 1809, the Reverend [[Thomas Frognall Dibdin]] published ''Bibliomania; or Book Madness'', a work described by literary critic Philip Connell as "a series of bizarre rambling dialogues which together comprised a kind of dramatized mock pathology, lavishly illustrated and, in the second edition, embellished with extensive footnotes on bibliography and the history of book collecting." The "symptoms" displayed by the biblomaniacs in Dibdin's work include "an obsession with uncut copies, fine paper or [[vellum]] pages, unique copies, [[first edition]]s, [[blackletter]] books, illustrated copies, association copies, and condemned or suppressed works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connell|first=Philip|title=Bibliomania: Book Collecting, Cultural Politics, and the Rise of Literary Heritage in Romantic Britain|journal=Representations|date=Summer 2000|volume=71|pages=24–47|doi=10.1525/rep.2000.71.1.01p00764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late nineteenth century, book collections and collectors of note were given regular coverage as curiosities.&lt;ref&gt;

Kingston SE is a hotbed of crayfishing and hosts the week-long Lobsterfest in ..."&lt;/ref&gt; the sculpture of a [[spiny lobster]] stands 17 metres tall, and is regarded as one of the most impressive of [[Australia's big things|Australia's Big Things]].&lt;ref name="AllThingBig2004"&gt;{{Harvnb|"All things big"|19 October 2004|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed and built by Paul Kelly for Ian Backler and Rob Moyse, it is made of [[steel]] and [[fibreglass]] and was intended to attract attention to the restaurant and visitor centre at which it is situated. The Big Lobster was opened on 15 December 1979 after six months of construction.

== History ==

The ''Big Lobster'' was originally conceived by Ian Backler. A local [[Lobster fishing|lobster fisherman]], he formulated a plan to build a [[Visitor center|visitor centre]] in Kingston SE while travelling in the [[United States]]. Upon returning to Australia he formed a partnership with Rob Moyse, and they engaged Ian Hannaford to develop the complex on a vacant block of land.&lt;ref name="Clark2004p181"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|2004|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Big Lobster'' was envisioned by the developers as a means of attracting attention to the centre, and initially the lobster was intended to "rear up" over the front of the complex. Unfortunately, the plans changed when [[Kingston District Council|local council]] regulations forced the lobster to be repositioned in front of the visitor centre. Paul Kelly, who had previously built the Big Scotsman in [[North Adelaide, South Australia|North Adelaide]], was employed to design and build the new structure. Kelly built the lobster in [[Edwardstown, South Australia]], and the final product was transported by road to the site, where it was opened by the [[Premiers of South Australia|South Australian Premier]] [[David Tonkin]] on 15 December 1979.&lt;ref name="Clark2004p181-182"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|2004|pp=181–182}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ian Backler and Rob Moyse ran the site for 15 years until selling it in 1984.&lt;ref name="Clark2004p183"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|2004|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new owners operated the complex until 1990, when it was sold to Eric and Kath Peltz.&lt;ref name="ForSale2001"&gt;{{Harvnb|"Big Lobster yours for $690,000"|2 October 2001|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current owners, Jenna Lawrie and Casey Sharpe, purchased the property from the Peltz' in 2007 after it had been on the market for six years.&lt;ref name="ForSale2001" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jenkin20071114"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jenkin|14 November 2007|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; They then renovated the site, making changes to the complex as well as steam cleaning the lobster, and formed plans to repaint "Larry" (as the lobster is locally known) as part of the process.&lt;ref name="Jenkin20071114" /&gt;

Radio duo [[Hamish &amp; Andy|Hamish and Andy]] launched the charity campaign #PinchAMate&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hamishandandy.com/2016/save-larry/|title=Save Larry! {{!}} Hamish &amp; Andy|last=Andy|first=Hamish &amp;|website=www.hamishandandy.com|access-date=2016-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; in early 2016 after a local man contacted the show with concern that, due to the Lobster's weathered condition, it would not survive the winter. The show started to raise awareness and collect funds for the Australian icon. However, the donations were lost after the duo bet on a horse race that they believed they had a "100% chance of winning". The Kingston's icon was somehow restored to its original beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design and construction ==

The ''Big Lobster'' is 17 metres high, 15.2 metres long and is 13.7 metres wide, with an approximate weight of 4 tonnes.&lt;ref name="Clark2004p181" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Scutt2009p93"&gt;{{Harvnb|Scutt|2009|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designer, Paul Kelly, modelled the structure on a lobster that he purchased and had [[Taxidermy|stuffed]] for the purpose, and built it at warehouse out of a steel frame with a fibreglass shell. The details were carved out of foam prior to the application of the fibreglass, before transporting it and having it reassembled on site. The process took approximately six months.&lt;ref name="Clark2004p182"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clark|2004|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visitor complex at which it was sited originally consisted of a restaurant, tourist area and a small theatrette.&lt;ref name="Clark2004p183" /&gt; Under the current management the restaurant has been altered to provide a more open-plan space, and it now incorporates the restaurant and a wine tasting area, with plans having been formulated to add accommodation and an accredited tourist centre to the venue.&lt;ref name="Jenkin20071114" /&gt;

{{wiktionary|camaieu}}
'''Camaïeu''' (also called ''en camaïeu'') is a technique that employs two or three [[tint]]s of a single [[color]], other than gray, to create a [[monochromatic]] image without regard to local or realistic color. When a picture is monochromatically rendered in gray, it is called [[grisaille]]; when in yellow, [[cirage]].{{ref|reference1}}

The term is also applied to monochrome painting in enamels. This technique uses a buildup of white enamel to create highlights and light areas. However, instead of using a black background, as in grisaille, transparent enamel is laid in first, beneath the whites. This technique is frequently used on [[snuffbox]]es, watches and medallions.

''{{lang|fr|Camaïeu}}'' can also refer, following the French usage, to [[chiaroscuro]] [[woodcut]] [[old master print|prints]] that imitate highlighted drawing on tinted paper. However, the correct term in English for these is ''chiaroscuro woodcuts''.

This French word once was synonymous with ''[[cameo (carving)|cameo]]'', but its meaning became restricted in the early eighteenth century.{{ref|reference2}}

Camaïeu is also a registered trademark of a manufacturer.

'''Cibola White Ware''' is a ceramic tradition of [[Arizona]] and [[New Mexico]], dating from 1225-1325 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Arleyn W. [http://archaeology.asu.edu/vm/southwest/salado/text.htm "Pottery and Pigments in Arizona: Salado Polychrome."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426021626/http://archaeology.asu.edu/vm/southwest/salado/text.htm |date=2012-04-26 }}  Department of Anthropology - Archaeological Research Institute Arizona State University (retrieved 4 Dec 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ware was produced roughly from the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]] south to the upper [[Gila River]] drainage, and from the [[White Mountains (Arizona)|White Mountains]] east to the [[Laguna Pueblo]] area (Goetze and Mills 1993:21)—and probably east into the Rio Grande drainage. Cibola White Ware shares its basic style (black designs painted on a white or light gray background) with a number of other regional wares, all produced by prehistoric [[Puebloan peoples]]. The various wares often shared stylistic ideas, and archaeologists make the various fine distinctions primarily to aid them in dating archaeological deposits and in tracing out prehistoric trade.

==Classification==
Most Cibola White Ware is distinguished from most other [[black-on-white]] wares by the use of crushed sherd temper in the preparation of clay for firing, along with the use of mineral-based black paint. If sherd temper is combined with black plant-based paint, the pottery is instead classified as Little Colorado White Ware (produced in the [[Little Colorado River]] drainage), with one exception, Chaco-McElmo Black-on-white. Also, some early Cibola White Ware vessels have mixed sand and sherd temper or all sand temper. The following table may help the reader understand where archaeologists have drawn the lines between one prehistoric ware and the next (see Goetze and Mills 1993:27–29 for further assistance).

'''Colombian [[folklore]]''' are beliefs, customs and [[Culture of Colombia|cultural traditions]] in [[Colombia]].

==Cultural influences==
[[Colombia]] has traditional [[Folklore|folk tale]]s and stories about [[legendary creatures]], which are transmitted orally and passed on to new [[generation]]s. Some of them are common with other [[Latin American]] countries. The Colombian folklore has strong influences from [[Spanish culture]], with elements of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American cultures]].

==Relevancy==
These folkloric entities are present in [[Festivals in Colombia|carnivals and festivals]] countrywide.  The “Desfiles de Mitos y Leyendas” ([[parade]]s of [[myth]]s and [[legend]]s) are an important part of these events in most of the Colombian cities and municipalities.  Examples of these parades are the [[Barranquilla Carnival]], [[Cali Fair]] and [[Festival of the Flowers]], where the legendary creatures parade takes place in [[Medellín]]'s Pueblito Paisa, at the top of [[Nutibara hill]]. Legendary creatures have also been accepted into many facets of [[popular culture]] and the [[collective memory]].  There are those who believe in their existence, claiming to have heard or even encountered them.

==Legendary figures==
[[File:Illustration Lonicera caprifolium0.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Lonicera]] plant is associated to the spirit of Madremonte]]
*The [[Tunda]] (La Tunda) is a myth of the [[Pacific Region of Colombia]], and particularly popular in the [[Afro-Colombian]] community, about a [[vampire]]-like [[doppelganger]] monster woman
*The [[Patasola]] or "one foot" is one of many myths in [[Latin American folklore]] about woman monsters from the jungle.
*The Boraro (The Pale Ones),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mythicalcreatureslist.com/mythical-creature/Boraro&lt;/ref&gt; is a more monstrous version of The [[Curupira]] from [[Brazilian Folklore]] in the mythology of the [[Tucano people]]. Much like the "Curupira" it has backwards facing feet to confuse it's foes and is a protector of wildlife. Beyond its feet however, it is far more grotesque in appearance. It is very tall to the extent it is tree sized, pale skinned but covered in black fur, has large forward facing ears, fangs and huge pendulous genitals. It has no joints in its knees, so if it falls down it has great trouble getting up. It uses two main ways to kills its victims, first its urine is a lethal poison .&lt;ref&gt;′′The Rainbow Serpent: AChromatic Piece′′-Ira R Buchler (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, if it catches a victim in its embrace it will crush them without breaking skin or bones, until their flesh is pulp. Then it drinks the pulp through a small hole made in the victims head, after which the victims empty skin is inflated like a balloon and are then sent home in a daze, where they subsequently die. It can be placated by tobacco, but to escape it one can either place their hands in its footprints which will cause its legs to stiffen and temporarily fell the monster, or alternatively run backwards while facing it, which confuses the monster.&lt;ref&gt;′′Latin American myths and legends′′-Javier Ocampo Lopez (2006), p.183&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Mohan (legendary)|Moan]] is a forest and river creature that protects the forests, steals women and disturbs fishing and hunting activities.
*The [[Llorona]] or the Weeping Woman is the [[ghost]] of a woman crying for her dead children that she drowned. Her appearances are sometimes held to presage [[death]].
*The Madremonte (Mother of the forest) or [[Marimonda]] is usually regarded as protective of nature and the [[forest]] animals and unforgiving when humans enter their domains to alter or destroy them. She can be identified with [[Mother Nature]] and [[Mistress of the Animals]].
*The Hombre Caiman, or Alligatorman, is a legendary creature that possesses both [[Alligator]] and human features. This South American folk tale is particularly popular in [[Plato, Magdalena]], especially in rural and less populated areas.  He is said to have been a [[fisherman]] converted by the spirit of the [[Magdalena river]] into an alligator, that returns every year on [[St. Sebastian]]´s day to hunt human victims, much like the [[werewolf]].
[[File:Inia.png|thumb|200px|1883 drawing of [[Boto]]. The [[Amazon river dolphin|pink dolphin]] is feared by the indigenous people as a mischievous spirit of water]]
*The Mohana (La Mojana) Mother of water or [[Mami Wata]] is a [[shapeshifting]] [[water]] spirit who usually appear in human form to seduce and take away the humans.  In the [[Amazon basin]] this features are applied to the [[Amazon river dolphin|Pink dolphin]]s representing the spirit of [[Amazon river]]. The discography of [[Music of Colombia#Traditional music|Colombian folkloric singer]] [[Totó la Momposina]] includes works about the Mohana.
*The evil chicken ("pollo maligno") is an [[evil spirit]] of the forest in the form of a bird that haunts the [[hunter]]s, attracting them to the deepest forest in order to devour them.
*The Candileja is said to be the spirit of a vicious old woman, who was in charge of her grandchildren but neglected to teach them any moral principles, so they grew up as murderers and thieves. In the [[afterlife]] she was damned to travel around the world surrounded by flames. It is related to the [[Will-o'-the-wisp]] phenomenon.
*The dark [[mule]] or Mula Retinta is an evil spirit that appears before [[arriero]]s as a [[pack animal]], causing violent winds and storms that make people fall off the precipices at the side of the pathways.
*The Viruñas or Mandingas (the Evil One), is considered a representation of [[Satan]], and appears as a handsome man who steals the souls of the people.

'''''Deep in My Heart''''' is a 1999 American [[television film|made-for-television]] [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] based on a true story, starring [[Anne Bancroft]] and [[Lynn Whitfield]] and directed by [[Anita W. Addison]]. Bancroft received a [[primetime Emmy]] for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie for her role. 

==Plot==
In [[Boston]] in the early 1960s, Geraldine Cummins was walking home alone from the movies when she was jumped and raped by a black man. Stunned, she returned home to her husband Bob, stating she had been raped. Sometime later, she finds she is pregnant. She keeps the baby for a few reasons: she is Catholic and she harbors a small hope that it could be her husband's baby. As the baby is black girl, she fears the social isolation she would receive and what people would think of her. She is heartbroken, but decides to give up her daughter. She names her newborn daughter Barbara Anne Cummins and gives her to foster mother Corrine Burrel, a black woman in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]].

Seven years later, Barbara is a happy little girl. A few months later, a social worker comes into their home and informs Corrine that Barbara will be adopted by Annalise and Paul, white people living in Wisconsin. Corrine seeks legal action, looking to adopt Barbara for herself, but as she is divorced with no job and many children, she is turned down.

Annalise becomes worried about Barbara's very detached nature and suggests to Paul they move to a suburban neighborhood where Barbara could be around other black kids. Paul is angry that they have to change everything for a child he did not want, but agrees, only to leave them after moving. Barbara has once again receded into herself after the neighborhood children make fun of her for being black with a white mother. Over the years until she is 16, she is alone without her mother or friends. At 16 she meets Don, a football playing choirboy. She falls in love with him and ultimately gets pregnant. 

Years later, in the middle of Barbara's third pregnancy, the doctor suggests she look into her birth family history for medical reasons. This leads her in search for her mother. She visits Corrine and later contacts the agency in charge of her adoption. By reading her adoption records, she comes to know the truth about her birth and her biological mother. After a night of contemplation, she decides to seek out her birth mother. 

Revitalized by the happiness of knowing she was wanted by both her birth mother and foster mother, Barbara reconciles with Annalise. Anxiously, Gerry and her 3 grown children wait at the airport for Barbara's arrival. Finally, after 34 years, mother and daughter meet. Barbara is angry as to why Gerry gave her up if she loves her, asking if it would have made a difference if she had been born white. Gerry says she only wanted the best for Barbara, to be with people who could teach her courage, which she could not, because Gerry felt ashamed for being raped and having a black daughter, though she loved her. Gerry apologizes to Barbara and the two reconcile as mother and daughter. Later, at a family reunion, Corrine, Gerry and Annalise meet again for the first time. The film ends with a picture of the entire side of Barbara's family, her mothers, her uncles, her brothers and sisters, her children, and her nieces and nephews, and Barbara no longer feels alone.

'''Earliest findings for Hominid art''' refers to archaeological findings that might be evidence of an artistic awareness and  artistic-like activities from  early ancestors of modern ''[[Human|Homo sapiens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archaeologyinfo.com/ ''Archaeology info''] → [http://archaeologyinfo.com/homo-sapiens/ ] Retrieved 16 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 
There is no known evidence to indicate artistic activity  in homonids of the [[Middle Stone Age]]. Artistic activity is defined as decorative production and production of either images or objects such as statues.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, B.D., B. Wood, A. Balkansky, J. Mercader, M. Panger -  ''Anthropology: The Study of Humanity''. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon. [http://www.ablongman.com/html/productinfo/millerwood/MillerWood_c08.pdf  html] ← [http://departments.columbian.gwu.edu/anthropology/people/183]  Retrieved 16 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Locating the earliest art work depends upon the suitability of the thing proposed as art with respect to a consensually agreed definition, as to those necessary factors characteristic of something fulfilling the purpose of artistic creation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Douglas Harper|Harper]] [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=art&amp;searchmode=none index] Retrieved 9 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest human artistic representations are thought by modern anthropologists to be African rock art made from red [[ochre]] around 100,000 B.C. in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/preh/hd_preh.htm Introduction to Prehistoric Art, 20,000–8000 B.C.] The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Retrieved 17 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The cave where the ochre mix was found, the [[Blombos Cave]], also contained snail shell jewellery and engraved stones dating from 75,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, T. 16 April 2004.

In September 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the earliest known drawing by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', which is estimated to be 73,000 years old, much earlier than the 43,000 years old artifacts understood to be the earliest known modern human drawings found previously.&lt;ref name="NYT-20180912"&gt;{{cite news |last=St. Fleur |first=Nicholas|title=Oldest Known Drawing by Human Hands Discovered in South African Cave |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/science/oldest-drawing-ever-found.html |date=12 September 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=15 September 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Editions of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''}}
{{see also|List of Dungeons &amp; Dragons rulebooks}}
Several different editions of the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' (''D&amp;D'') fantasy [[role-playing game]] have been produced since 1974. The current publisher of ''D&amp;D'', [[Wizards of the Coast]], produces new materials only for the most current edition of the game. Many ''D&amp;D'' fans, however, continue to play older versions of the game and some third-party companies continue to publish materials compatible with these older editions.

After the original edition of ''D&amp;D'' was introduced in 1974, the game was split into two branches in 1977: the rules-light system of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' and the more complex, rules-heavy system of ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' (''AD&amp;D''). The standard game was eventually expanded into a series of five box sets by the mid-1980s before being compiled and slightly revised in 1991 as the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia]]''. Meanwhile, the 2nd edition of ''AD&amp;D'' was published in 1989. In 2000, the 3rd edition, called simply ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', debuted. The 4th edition was published in 2008. The 5th edition was released in 2014.

==Version history==

===Original ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''===
{{main article|Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1974)}}
[[Image:D&amp;d Box1st.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The 1974 ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons (1974)|Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' box set]]
The original ''D&amp;D'' was published as a [[box set]] in 1974 and featured only a handful of the elements for which the game is known today: just three [[Character class (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|character classes]] ([[Warrior (character class)|fighting-man]], [[Wizard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|magic-user]], and [[Cleric (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|cleric]]); four races ([[Human (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|human]], [[Dwarf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|dwarf]], [[Elf (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|elf]], and [[Halfling (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|hobbit]]); only a few monsters; only three [[Alignment (role-playing games)|alignments]] (lawful, neutral, and chaotic). The rules assumed that players owned and played the [[Miniature wargaming|miniatures wargame]] ''[[Chainmail (game)|Chainmail]]'' and used its measurement and combat systems. An optional combat system was included within the rules that later developed into the sole combat system of later versions of the game. In addition, the rules presumed ownership of ''[[Outdoor Survival]]'', a board game by then-unaffiliated company [[Avalon Hill]] for outdoor exploration and adventure. ''D&amp;D'' was a radically new gaming concept at the time, and it was difficult for players without prior tabletop wargaming experience to grasp the vague rules. The release of the ''[[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]]'' supplement removed the game's dependency on the ''Chainmail'' rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Pulsipher | first = Lewis | title = An Introduction to Dungeons &amp; Dragons | periodical = [[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] | place = London, England | publisher = [[Games Workshop]] | date=February–March 1981 | issue = 23 | pages = 8–9 |quote=''Chainmail'' was needed to conduct combat...." "''Greyhawk'' introduced a new combat system....}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made it much easier for new, non-wargaming players to grasp the concepts of play. It also inadvertently aided the growth of competing game publishers, since just about anyone who grasped the concepts behind the game could write smoother and easier to use rules systems and sell them to the growing ''D&amp;D'' fanbase (''[[Tunnels &amp; Trolls]]'' being the first such).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Pulsipher | first = Lewis | title = Open Box: Tunnels and Trolls | periodical = [[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] | place = London, England | publisher = [[Games Workshop]] | date = August–September 1977 | issue = 2 | issn = 0265-8712 | postscript =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supplements such as ''[[Greyhawk (supplement)|Greyhawk]]'', ''[[Blackmoor (supplement)|Blackmoor]]'', ''[[Eldritch Wizardry]]'' and ''[[Gods, Demi-Gods &amp; Heroes]]'', published over the next two years, greatly expanded the rules, character classes, monsters and spells. For example, the original ''Greyhawk'' supplement introduced the [[Rogue (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|thief]] class, and weapon damage varying by weapon (as opposed to character class). In addition, many additions and options were published in the magazines ''The Strategic Review'' and its successor, ''[[Dragon (magazine)|The Dragon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dndclassics.com/product/17003/Players-Handbook-1e?it=1|title=Players Handbook (1e)|last=Appelcline|first=Shannon|website=dndclassics.com|accessdate=August 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons''===

{{Redirect|Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons|the "[[Community (TV series)|Community]]" episode|Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons (Community)}}
An updated version of ''D&amp;D'' was released between 1977 and 1979 as '''''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons''''' (''AD&amp;D''). The game rules were reorganized and re-codified across three hardcover rulebooks, compiled by [[Gary Gygax]], incorporating the original ''D&amp;D'' rules and many additions and revisions from supplements and magazine articles. The three core rulebooks were the ''[[Monster Manual]]'' (1977), the ''[[Player's Handbook]]'' (1978), and the ''[[Dungeon Master's Guide]]'' (1979). Major additions included classes from supplements like [[Assassin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|assassin]], [[Druid (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|druid]], [[Monk (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|monk]], [[Paladin (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|paladin]], and thief,&lt;ref name="WD10"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Turnbull | first =Don | authorlink =  | title = Open Box: Player's Handbook | journal = [[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] | issue = 10 | page = 17 | publisher = [[Games Workshop]] | date = December 1978 – January 1979 | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Bard (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|bard]], illusionist and [[Ranger (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|ranger]], which had previously only appeared in magazine articles, were added to the core rulebooks.

Later supplements for ''AD&amp;D'' included ''[[Deities &amp; Demigods]]'' (1980), ''[[Fiend Folio]]'' (another book of monsters produced semi-autonomously in the UK - 1981), ''[[Monster Manual II]]'' (1983), ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' and ''[[Unearthed Arcana]]'' (1985), the latter of which mostly compiled material previously published in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' magazine,&lt;ref name="DR95"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gygax |first=Gary |authorlink=Gary Gygax |journal=[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]] |date=March 1985 |issue=95 |publisher=TSR| title=Demi-Humans Get a Lift|pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

===''Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set'' and revisions===
{{main article|Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set}}
[[File:D&amp;d original.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The cover of the first ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' Basic Set]]

While ''AD&amp;D'' was still in the works, TSR was approached by an outside writer and ''D&amp;D'' enthusiast, [[John Eric Holmes]], who offered to re-edit and rewrite the original rules into an introductory version of ''D&amp;D''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Holmes|first1=John Eric|title=Fantasy Role Playing Games|date=1981|publisher=Hippocrene Books|location=New York|isbn=9780882545141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although TSR was focused on ''AD&amp;D'' at the time, the project was seen as a profitable enterprise and a way to direct new players to anticipate the release of the ''AD&amp;D'' game. It was published in July 1977 as the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set|Basic Set]]'', collecting together and organizing the rules from the original ''D&amp;D'' boxed set and ''Greyhawk'' supplement into a single booklet, which covered character levels 1 through 3, and included dice and a beginner's module. The booklet featured a blue cover with artwork by [[David C. Sutherland III]]. The "blue booklet" explained the game's concepts and method of play in terms that made it accessible to new players not familiar with tabletop miniatures wargaming. Unusual features of this version included an alignment system of five alignments as opposed to the three or nine alignments of the other versions. This ''Basic Set'' was very popular and allowed many to discover and experience the ''D&amp;D'' game for the first time. Although the ''Basic Set'' is not fully compatible with ''AD&amp;D'', as some rules were simplified to make the game easier for new players to learn, players were expected to continue play beyond third level by moving on to the ''AD&amp;D'' version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holmes|authorlink=John Eric Holmes|first=J. Eric|title=Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic Set|date=1977| page=6|quote="...experience levels that high are not discussed in this book and the reader is referred to the more complete rules in ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once ''AD&amp;D'' had been released, the ''Basic Set'' saw a major revision in 1981 by [[Tom Moldvay]], which was immediately followed by the release of an ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Expert Set|Expert Set]]'' written by [[David Cook (game designer)|David Cook]], to accompany the ''Basic Set'', extending it to levels 4 through 14, for players who preferred the simplified introductory ruleset. With this revision, the ''Basic'' rules became their own game, distinct both from original ''D&amp;D'' and ''AD&amp;D''. The revised ''Basic'' rules can be distinguished from the original ones by cover colors: the ''Basic'' booklet had a red cover, and the ''Expert'' booklet a blue one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title =D&amp;D Clones! | journal =[[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]] | issue = 24 | page =29 | publisher =[[Games Workshop]] |date=April–May 1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1983 and 1985 this system was revised and expanded by [[Frank Mentzer]] as a series of five boxed sets, including the ''Basic Rules'' (red cover), ''Expert Rules'' (blue), ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Companion Set|Companion Rules]]'' (green, supporting levels 15 through 25), ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Master Rules|Master Rules]]'' (black, supporting levels 26 through 36), and ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Immortals Rules|Immortals Rules]]'' (gold, supporting Immortals—characters who had transcended levels).

This version was compiled and slightly revised by [[Aaron Allston]] in 1991 as the ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rules Cyclopedia|Rules Cyclopedia]]'', a hardback book which included all the sets except ''Immortals Rules'' which was discontinued and replaced with the ''[[Wrath of the Immortals]]'' boxed set accessory. While the ''Rules Cyclopedia'' included all information required to begin the game, there was a revised introductory boxed set, named ''The New Easy-to-Master Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game'', nicknamed "the black box".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dndclassics.com/product/17171/DD-Rules-Cyclopedia-Basic?src=hottest_filtered&amp;it=1&amp;filters=0_0_44699|title=D&amp;D Rules Cyclopedia|last=Appelcline|first=Shannon|accessdate=June 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A final repackaging of the introductory set, titled ''The Classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons Game'' was released in 1994. By the end of 1995, TSR ended its support for the line.

===''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd edition''===
[[File:Advanced_Dungeons_and_Dragons_2nd_Edition_Player's_Handbook.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 2nd edition ''Player's Handbook'']]
In 1987, a small team of designers at TSR led by David "Zeb" Cook began work on the second edition of the ''AD&amp;D'' game, which would take two years to complete.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_History.asp| title=The History of TSR| publisher=[[Wizards of the Coast]]| accessdate=August 20, 2005| archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wizards.com%2Fdnd%2FDnDArchives_History.asp&amp;date=2008-10-04| archivedate=October 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, '''''Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2nd Edition''''' was published, featuring new rules and characters.&lt;ref name="D&amp;Dfaq"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.wizards.com/dnd/DnDArchives_FAQ.asp| title = ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' FAQ| accessdate = October 3, 2008| publisher = Wizards of the Coast| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wizards.com%2Fdnd%2FDnDArchives_FAQ.asp&amp;date=2008-10-03| archivedate = October 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of its first decade, ''AD&amp;D'' had expanded to several rulebooks, including three collections of monsters (''Monster Manual'', ''Monster Manual II'', ''Fiend Folio''), and two books governing character skills in wilderness and underground settings. Gygax had already planned a second edition for the game, which would also have been an update of the rules, incorporating the material from ''Unearthed Arcana'', ''[[Oriental Adventures]]'', and numerous new innovations from ''Dragon'' magazine in the ''Player's Handbook'' and ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' and would have consolidated the ''Monster Manual'', ''Monster Manual II'' and ''Fiend Folio'' into one volume.&lt;ref&gt;Gygax, Gary. "From the Sorcerer's Scroll: The Future of the Game". ''Dragon Magazine'', #103, November, 1985, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, the 2nd edition was planned to consolidate the game, but more changes were made during development, while still aiming at backwards compatibility with 1st edition.

The release of ''AD&amp;D 2nd Edition'' corresponded with important policy changes at TSR. An effort was made to remove aspects of the game which had attracted negative publicity, most notably the removal of all mention of [[Demon (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|demons]] and [[Devil (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|devils]], although equivalent fiendish monsters were included, renamed tanar'ri and baatezu, respectively. Moving away from the moral ambiguity of the 1st edition ''AD&amp;D'', the TSR staff eliminated character classes and races like the assassin and the [[half-orc]], and stressed heroic roleplaying and player teamwork. The target age of the game was also lowered, with most 2nd edition products being aimed primarily at teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web||url=http://www.dmsguild.com/product/16868|title=Player's Handbook, Revised (2e)|last=Applecline|first=Shannon|accessdate=February 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was again published as three core rulebooks which incorporated the expansions and revisions which had been published in various supplements over the previous decade. However, the ''Monster Manual'' was replaced by the ''[[Monstrous Compendium]]'', a loose-leaf binder in which every monster is given a full page of information. It was the intention that packs of new monsters (often setting-specific) could be purchased and added to the binder without the expense or inconvenience of a separate book, allowing the book to be updated and customized as needed. This format proved highly susceptibile to wear and tear, however, and presented difficulties in keeping alphabetic order when pages had been printed with monsters on each side. Subsequently, the loose leaf formatting was abandoned and the ''Compendium'' as a core book was replaced by single-volume hardcover ''[[Monstrous Manual]]'' in 1993, collecting popular monsters from the ''Compendium''. The edition also greatly increases the power of dragons to counter the impression of relative weakness of the game's titular monster.

Numerous mechanical changes were made to the game. The combat system was modified. The minimum number required to hit a target uses a mathematical formula in which the defender's [[armor class]] (AC) is subtracted from the attacker's THAC0 ("To Hit Armor Class '0'") number, a simplification of 1st edition's attack matrix tables that had appeared as an optional rule in the 1st edition ''DMG''. Distances are based on in-game units (feet) rather than miniatures-board ones (inches). Critical hits are offered as optional rules.

Character creation is modified in many ways. [[Character race (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Demi-human]] races are given higher level maximums to increase their long-term playability, though they are still restricted in terms of character class flexibility. Character classes are organized into four groups: warrior (fighter, paladin, ranger), wizard (mage, specialist wizard), priest (cleric, druid), and rogue (thief, bard). Assassins and monks were removed from the game as character classes, "magic-users" are renamed "mages", illusionists are made into a subtype of the wizard class, along with new classes specializing in the other schools of magic. Proficiencies are officially supported in the ''Player's Handbook'' and many supplements, rather than being an optional add-on. [[Psionics (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Psionics]] are no longer included in the ''Player's Handbook'', though they later appeared in their own supplement.

====Player's Option====
In 1995, TSR re-released the core rulebooks for 2nd Edition with new covers, art, and page layouts.&lt;ref name="2.5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dndclassics.com/product/16862/Player%27s-Option---Combat-%26-Tactics-%282e%29?term=players+option&amp;it=1|title=''Player's Option: Combat &amp; Tactics''|last=Appelcline|first=Shannon|website=dndclassics.com|accessdate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These releases were followed shortly by a series of volumes labelled ''Player's Option'', allowing for alternate rules systems and character options, as well as a ''Dungeon Master Option'' for high-level campaigns. They consisted of:
* ''[[Player's Option: Combat &amp; Tactics]]''
* ''[[Player's Option: Skills &amp; Powers]]''
* ''[[Player's Option: Spells &amp; Magic]]''
* ''[[Dungeon Master Option: High-Level Campaigns]]''

Some of the optional rules included the introduction of a point-based system to allow players to pick and choose parts of classes to make their own class, and a more tactical combat system including attacks of opportunity.

===''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 3rd edition===
[[File:Dungeons_and_Dragons_3rd_Edition_Player's_Handbook.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 3rd edition ''Player's Handbook'']]

A major revision of the ''AD&amp;D'' rules was released in 2000. As the ''Basic'' game had been discontinued some years earlier, and the more straightforward title was more marketable, the word "advanced" was dropped and the new edition was named just ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', but still officially referred to as 3rd edition (or ''3E'' for short). It is the basis of a broader role-playing system designed around 20-sided dice, called the [[d20 System]].

[[Monte Cook]], [[Jonathan Tweet]], and [[Skip Williams]] all contributed to the 3rd edition ''Player's Handbook'', ''Dungeon Master's Guide'', and ''Monster Manual'', and then each designer wrote one of the books based on those contributions.&lt;ref name="Dragon #275"&gt;{{cite journal| last = | first = | authorlink = | title = Profiles: Monte Cook| journal = [[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]| issue = #275| pages = 10, 12, 14| publisher = Wizards of the Coast| location = [[Renton, Washington]]|date=September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The d20 system uses a more unified mechanic than earlier editions, resolving nearly all actions with a d20 die roll plus appropriate modifiers. Modifiers based on ability scores follow a standardized formula. [[Saving throw]]s are reduced from five categories based on forms of attack to three based on type of defense.

The combat system is greatly expanded, adopting into the core system most of the optional movement and combat system of the 2nd edition ''Players Option: Combat and Tactics'' book. Third edition combat allows for a grid system, encouraging highly tactical gameplay and facilitating the use of miniatures.

New character options were introduced. The new [[Sorcerer (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|sorcerer]] class was introduced. The thief is renamed rogue, a term that 2nd edition uses to classify both the thief and bard classes, and introduces [[prestige class]]es, which characters can only enter at higher character levels, and only if they meet certain character-design prerequisites or fulfill certain in-game goals. Later products included additional and supplementary rules subsystems such as "epic-level" options for characters above 20th level, as well as a heavily revised treatment of psionics.

3rd edition removes previous editions' restrictions on class and race combinations that were intended to track the preferences of the race, and on the level advancement of non-human characters. [[Skills (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|Skills]] and the new system of [[Feat (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|feats]] are introduced replacing non-weapon proficiencies, to allow players to further customize their characters.

The d20 System is presented under the [[Open Game License]], which makes it an [[open source]] system for which authors can write new games and game supplements without the need to develop a unique rules system and, more importantly, without the need for direct approval from Wizards of the Coast. This makes it easier to market D&amp;D-compatible content under a broadly recognizable commercial license.

====''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' v3.5====
[[Image:Dnd v3 5 rulesbooks.png|thumb|right|The ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' v. 3.5 core rulebooks]]
In July 2003, a revised version of the 3rd edition ''D&amp;D'' rules (termed ''v. 3.5'') was released that incorporated numerous small rule changes, as well as expanding the ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' and ''Monster Manual''. This revision was intentionally a small one focusing on addressing common complaints about certain aspects of gameplay, hence the "half edition" version number. The basic rules are fundamentally the same, and many monsters and items are compatible (or even unchanged) between those editions. New spells are added, and numerous changes are made to existing spells, while some spells are removed from the updated ''Player's Handbook''.&lt;ref name="update"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dnd/20030718a |title=D&amp;D v3.5 Accessory Update Booklet |work=wizards.com |accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New feats are added and numerous changes are made to existing feats, while several skills are renamed or merged with other skills.

===''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 4th edition===
[[Image:Dungeons_and_Dragons_4th_Edition_Player's_Handbook.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' 4th edition ''Player's Handbook'']]
On August 15, 2007, Wizards of the Coast announced the development of ''D&amp;D'' 4th edition. In December 2007, the book ''[[Wizards Presents: Races and Classes]]'', the first preview of 4th Edition, was released. This was followed by a second book in January 2008 named ''[[Wizards Presents: Worlds and Monsters]]''. The ''Player's Handbook'', ''Monster Manual'', and ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' were released in June 2008.

[[Slashdot]] reported anger from some players and retailers due to the financial investment in v3.5 and the relatively brief period of time that it had been in publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/08/22/1847207| title=Gen Con 2007 In A Nutshell| author=Zonk | date=August 22, 2007| accessdate=August 23, 2007| publisher=[[Slashdot.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many players chose to continue playing older editions, or other games such as ''[[Pathfinder Roleplaying Game|Pathfinder]]'',&lt;ref name="wired1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harnish|first=MJ|title=5th Edition D&amp;D Is in Development — Should We Care?|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2012/01/5th-edition-dungeons-and-dragons/|work=Wired.com|publisher=Conde Nast|accessdate=October 1, 2013|date=January 9, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303225739/http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2012/01/5th-edition-dungeons-and-dragons/|archivedate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the initial print run of the 4th edition sold out during preorders, and Wizards of the Coast announced a second print run prior to the game's official release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icv2.com/articles/news/12654.html |title=D&amp;D 4E Back to Press |work=ICv2.com |date= May 30, 2008 |accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike previous editions with just three core rulebooks, 4th edition core rules include multiple volumes of the ''Player's Handbook'', ''Dungeon Master's Guide'', and ''Monster Manual'' that were released yearly, with each new book becoming a part of the core.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Dave Noonan, Mike Mearls, and James Wyatt |date=October 5, 2007|title=Episode 16: Monsters, Monsters, Monsters!|quote="So, one of the things that I thought a lot about when I was first putting together the outline for this book... this is not the core ''Monster Manual''.... So, there are some monsters that I very intentionally left out of this book so that when they appear in ''Monster Manual II'', that will help communicate, "Hey, look, this is a core ''Monster Manual''." You don't have frost giants if you don't have ''Monster Manual N''". |url=http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/4pod/20071005e16 |format= podcast|time= 1:57|publisher=Wizards of the Coast}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first ''Player's Handbook'', the [[Warlock (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|warlock]] and [[Warlord (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|warlord]] are included, while the barbarian, bard, druid, sorcerer and monk are not present. Of those classes, the first four were included in ''Player's Handbook 2'', while the monk class appears in ''Player's Handbook 3''.

Mechanically, 4th edition saw a major overhaul of the game’s systems. Changes in spells and other per-encounter resourcing, giving all classes a similar number of at-will, per-encounter and per-day ''powers''. Powers have a wide range of effects including inflicting status effects, creating zones, and forced movement, making combat very tactical for all classes but essentially requiring use of miniatures, reinforced by the use of squares to express distances. Attack rolls, skill checks and defense values all get a bonus equal to one-half level, rounded down, rather than increasing at different rates depending on class or skill point investment. Each skill is either trained (providing a fixed bonus on skill checks, and sometimes allowing more exotic uses for the skills) or untrained, but in either case all characters also receive a bonus to all skill rolls based on level. A system of “healing surges” and short and long rests are introduced to act as resource management.

The system of prestige classes is replaced. Characters at 11th level choose a "paragon path", a specialty based on their class, which defines some of their new powers through 20th level. At level 21, an "epic destiny" is chosen in a similar manner., the paragon path and the epic destiny replace the prestige class system of 3rd edition. Core rules extend to level 30 rather than level 20, bringing "[[epic level]]" play back into the core rules.

====''Dungeons &amp; Dragons Essentials''====
This product line debuted in September 2010 and consisted of ten products intended to lower the barrier of entry into the game. ''Essentials'' uses the ''D&amp;D'' 4th edition rule set and provides simple player character options intended for first-time players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://critical-hits.com/2010/01/29/dd-xp-2010-dungeons-dragons-essentials/ |title=D&amp;D XP 2010: Dungeons &amp; Dragons Essentials — Critical Hits |publisher=Critical-hits.com |date=January 29, 2010|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the new player character options emulated features from previous editions, such as schools of magic for the wizard class, as to appeal to older players who had not adopted 4th edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Complete Mike Mearls D&amp;D 4th Edition Essentials Interview |url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/columns/writersroom/8115-Complete-Mike-Mearls-D-D-4th-Edition-Essentials-Interview |title=&amp;#124; The Escapist |publisher=Escapistmagazine.com|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, Wizards of the Coast announced that a new edition of the game, at the time referred to as ''D&amp;D Next'', was under development.&lt;ref name="wired1"/&gt; In direct contrast to the previous editions of the game, ''D&amp;D Next'' was developed partly via a public open playtest.&lt;ref name="NYT remake"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/10/arts/video-games/dungeons-dragons-remake-uses-players-input.html | title=Players Roll the Dice for Dungeons &amp; Dragons Remake | work=[[The New York Times]] | author=Gilsdorf, Ethan | page=2 | date=January 9, 2012 | accessdate=January 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early build of the new edition debuted at the 2012 ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons Experience'' event to about 500 fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ohannessian|first=Kevin|title="Dungeons &amp; Dragons Next" Creators Look To Simplicity, Open Development To Regain Lost Gamers|url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/1679620/dungeons-dragons-next-creators-look-to-simplicity-open-development-to-regain-lost-gamers|accessdate=August 30, 2013|newspaper=Co.Create|date=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public playtesting began on May 24, 2012,&lt;ref name="Next playtest starts"&gt;{{cite web |author=Mike Mearls |url=http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4news/20120425a |title=Dungeons &amp; Dragons Roleplaying Game Official Home Page - Article (News on D&amp;D Next) |publisher=Wizards.com |date=April 25, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720201719/http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd%2F4news%2F20120425a |archivedate=July 20, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the final playtest packet released on September 20, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4news/20130920 |title=Final Playtest Packet |publisher=Wizards.com |date=September 20, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140721200345/http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Article.aspx?x=dnd%2F4news%2F20130920 |archivedate=July 21, 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5th edition's ''Basic Rules'', a free [[PDF]] containing complete rules for play and a subset of the player and DM content from the core rulebooks, was released on July 3, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules?x=dnd/basicrules |title=5E Basic Rules |publisher=Wizards.com |date=July 3, 2014|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Starter Set'' was released on July 15, featuring a set of pre-generated characters, a set of instructions for basic play, and the adventure module ''Lost Mine of Phandelver''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_starterset?x=dnd/products/dndacc/starterset |title=5E starter Set |publisher=Wizards.com |accessdate=August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Player's Handbook'' was released on August 19, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mearls |first=Mike |url=http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_playershandbook |title=Player's Handbook &amp;#124; Dungeons &amp; Dragons |publisher=Dnd.wizards.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth edition ''Monster Manual'' was released on September 30, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/monster-manual|title=Monster Manual|publisher=wizards.com|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dungeon Master's Guide'' was released on December 9, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mearls |first=Mike |url=http://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/dungeon-masters-guide |title=Dungeon Master's Guide &amp;#124; Dungeons &amp; Dragons |publisher=Dnd.wizards.com |date= |accessdate=2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The edition returns to having only three core rule books, with the ''Player’s Handbook'' containing most major races and classes.

Mechanically, 5th edition draws heavily on prior editions, while introducing some new mechanics intended to simplify and streamline play. Actions are now more dependent on checks made with the six core abilities with skills taking a more supportive role.

Skills, weapons, items, saving throws and other things that characters are trained in now all use a single proficiency bonus that increases as character level increases. Multiple defense values have been removed, returning to a single defense value of armor class and using more traditional saving throws. Saving throws are reworked to be situational checks based on the six core abilities instead of generic d20 rolls. Feats are now optional features that can be taken instead of ability score increases and are reworked to be occasional major upgrades instead of frequent minor upgrades.

The "advantage/disadvantage" mechanic was introduced, streamlining conditional and situational modifiers to a simpler mechanic: rolling two d20s for a situation and taking the higher of the two for "advantage" and the lower of the two for "disadvantage" and canceling each other out when both apply.

The power system of 4th edition was replaced with more traditional class features that are gained as characters level. Each spell-casting class uses a unique system to cast their spells, with wizards and clerics using a slightly modified version of the spell preparation system of previous editions. Healing Surges are replaced by Hit Dice, requiring a character to roll a hit die during a short rest instead of healing a flat rate of hit points.

==''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'' variants==
[[Kenzer &amp; Company]] received permission from Wizards of the Coast to produce a parody version of 1st and 2nd edition ''AD&amp;D''. They published the humorously numbered ''[[HackMaster]]'' 4th edition from 2001 until they lost their license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kenzer|first1=David S.|authorlink=David Kenzer|title=HackMaster: A History|url=http://www.kenzerco.com/hackmaster/pdf/hackmaster_history.pdf|website=[[Kenzer &amp; Company]]|accessdate=January 29, 2018|date=April 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was well received and won the [[Origins Award]] for ''Game of the Year 2001''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2001 - List of Winners|url=http://www.originsgames.com/awards/2001|website=The Academy of Adventure Gaming Arts &amp; Design|publisher=Wayback Machine|accessdate=January 29, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830114254/http://www.originsgames.com/awards/2001|archivedate=August 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new edition of ''Hackmaster'' was released in 2011 that no longer uses ''AD&amp;D'' mechanics as Kenzer &amp; Company's license expired. 

The publication of the [[System Reference Document]] (SRD) for 3rd edition under the [[Open Game License]] (OGL) allowed other companies to use the rules to create their own variants of ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons'', providing that they did not use anything Wizards of the Coast considered trade dress or signature content, known as "product identity" under the terms of the OGL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/d20/files/OGLv1.0a.rtf|title=Open Gaming License v1.0a|publisher=Wizards of the Coast|date=2000|accessdate=October 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Castles &amp; Crusades]]'', published in 2004 by [[Troll Lord Games]], is an early example of the OGL and SRD being used to recreate the experience of older editions.&lt;ref name="OSRhistory"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malisczewski|first1=James|title=Full Circle: A History of the Old School Revival|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/tabletop/columns/days-of-high-adventure/6412-Full-Circle-A-History-of-the-Old-School-Revival|accessdate=November 23, 2015|work=The Escapist|date=August 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons retro-clones|Retro-clones]]" are variants created to even more closely simulate previous editions, part of a movement known as the [[Old School Revival]].&lt;ref name="OSRhistory"/&gt; Prominent retro-clones include ''[[Labyrinth Lord]]'', ''[[OSRIC]]'', and ''[[Swords &amp; Wizardry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harnish|first1=MJ|title=Everything Old Is New Again: Old School D&amp;D|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/08/everything-old-is-new-again-old-school-dd/|accessdate=November 23, 2015|work=Wired|date=August 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[Pathfinder Roleplaying Game]]'' was first published in 2009 by [[Paizo Publishing]]. It is intended to be backward-compatible with ''D&amp;D'' v. 3.5 while adjusting some rules balance, and has been nicknamed "v. 3.75" by some fans.&lt;ref name="present"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tito|first=Greg|title=The State of D&amp;D: Present|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/features/9293-The-State-of-D-D-Present.2|work=The Escapist|accessdate=1 October 2013|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wired2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Baichtal|first=John|title=No D&amp;D 4E for Paizo?!?|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2008/03/no-dd-4e-for-pa/|work=Wired.com|publisher=Conde Nast|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717020004/http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2008/03/no-dd-4e-for-pa|archivedate=July 17, 2012 |accessdate=October 1, 2013|date=March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pathfinder has been one of the best-selling role playing games in the industry.&lt;ref name="wired1"/&gt;

''[[13th Age]]'' is a game designed by [[Jonathan Tweet]], a lead designer of the 3rd Edition, and [[Rob Heinsoo]], a lead designer of 4th Edition, and published by [[Pelgrane Press]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pelgranepress.com/?p=12345 |title=Pelgrane Press Ltd » Blog Archive » Through the Scrying Glass: 13th Age Released |publisher=Pelgranepress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International editions==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
The ''D&amp;D'' franchise has been translated and published in several languages around the world.

A particular challenge has been the word [[dungeon]], which in standard English means a single prison cell or [[oubliette]] originally located under a [[keep]]. Some languages, like Spanish, Italian, Finnish, and Portuguese, didn't translate the title of the game and kept it as it is in English: ''Dungeons &amp; Dragons''. In Spanish-speaking countries, the 1983 animated series was translated in [[Hispanic America]] as ''Calabozos y Dragones'' and in [[Spain]] as ''Dragones y Mazmorras'' (''calabozo'' and ''mazmorra'' have in all Spanish-speaking countries the same meaning: a dungeon). In [[Brazil]], the same animated series was translated as ''Caverna do Dragão'' (''Dragon's Cave''). This still brings great confusion amongst Spanish-speaking and Brazilian gamers about the name of the game, since all Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese translations of the game kept the original English title. In gaming jargon, however, a dungeon is not a single holding cell but rather a [[dungeon crawl|network of underground passages]] or [[Subterranea (geography)|subterranea]] to be explored, such as a [[cave]], [[ruins]] or [[catacombs]]. Some translations conveyed this meaning well, e.g. Chinese ''龙与地下城'' (''Dragons and Underground Castles'', or ''Dragons and Underground Cities''). Some translations used a [[false friend]] of "dungeon", even if it changed the meaning of the title, such as the French ''Donjons et dragons'' (''Keeps and Dragons''). In Hebrew, the game was published as ''מבוכים ודרקונים'' (''Labyrinths and Dragons''). Additionally, some translations adopted the English word "dungeon" as a game term, leaving it untranslated in the text as well.

{{about|theatre electricians|construction electricians|electrician}}
In [[theatre]], an  '''electrician''' is a person who works with the various aspects of lighting. Some of the positions among electricians include the lighting supervisor, master electrician, deck electrician, light board operator, moving light programmer, [[Spotlight (theatre lighting)|followspot]] operator, as well as simply electricians. This group is generally known as the "Electrics" Department or LX Department.  

These people are responsible for receiving the [[light plot]] from the [[lighting designer]] and translating the design as it is on paper to the lighting that is seen by the audience in the final [[theatrical|production]]. In small theatres, many of these roles may be filled by a single person, while in a large production such as those on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] or a large tour, there may be several people filling some of the roles.

== Duties  ==
[[Image:Focusing stage lights.jpg|thumb|right|An electrician focuses a light]]
Theatre electricians are responsible for all non-design aspects of the lighting in a theatrical production. They may also be responsible for special effects (such as fog) and powering other electrical items (such as motors) used in the production.

Electricians install (hang), point and shape the beam (focus), and connect to power (circuit) [[lighting instrument]]s. Additionally they may add gel to color the light, patterns (or gobos) to create texture or shape a light into pictures, and accessories that give the designer the ability to change some aspect of the light, such as scrollers (color changers) or pattern effects (gobo rotators).

In the past (and even in some theatres today) the electrics department was in charge of all water and water effects used on or offstage (i.e. rain, waterfalls, pools, etc.).

==  Positions ==
=== Lighting supervisor ===
The '''lighting supervisor''' is responsible for acting as the go-between for the designers, and the theatre's electrics staff. In the cases of shows done in repertory, they may have to adapt the designs of several designers to work together given the limits of the [[Theatre|venue]] and the equipment, budget, and time available. In the case of a re-mount, they may adapt a design to newer equipment or a different venue than the design was originally created for. While Broadway and high end Off-Broadway productions have this position, the Master Electrician is often responsible for these duties in smaller productions.

=== Deck electrician ===
The '''deck electrician''', '''"stage electrician"''', '''"floor electrician"''', '''"floor LX"''', '''"deck elec"'''or just "'''stage LX'''"  is a member of the [[running crew]] for a production and is responsible for all aspects of running the lighting for the show that happen on or backstage. This can include such things as changing color, focusing and readjusting lights that were moved, connecting and disconnecting [[Stage lighting instrument|practical units]] or set pieces which are electrified, and in some venues, assisting with motor control or effects.  On touring or musical productions this individual is also referred to as the '''Dimmer Technician''', as their responsibilities include supervising and maintaining portable dimmer racks.

=== Load in electrician ===
The '''Load in electrician''' or "'''production electrician'''" in the UK, often referred to simply as an electrician, is a person usually hired on a per day or per project basis (freelance) to hang, circuit and focus the lights. Once the show goes into tech, the Load in Electrician will usually leave, although they may stay around to do "notes" with the lighting designer which may include adding or taking away lights, refocusing, or re-gelling lights. Even small productions usually have at least one or two Load in Electricians who are supervised by the Master Electrician.

=== Light board operator ===
{{main|Light board operator}}
The '''light board operator''', '''lighting operator''', '''noard op''' or just '''LX op''' is the person who executes [[cue (theatrical)|cues]] for a production. This can range from adjusting light levels of individual dimmers, such as on a two scene preset board, to simply pressing a "Go" button on a computer controlled console. They may need to be able to write cues for their lighting board, and to make adjustments quickly to account for equipment failure, or people being in the wrong location. For some live events, such as concerts, this person may also be creating cues and looks on the fly, and functioning both as an operator and a designer simultaneously.

=== Master electrician ===
{{main|Master electrician}}
The '''master electrician''', '''M.E.''' or '''"chief electrician"''' in the UK, supervises all other Electricians working on a production or show.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite book | last = Parker | first = W. Oren | title = Scene Design and Stage Lighting | isbn = 0-03-028777-4 | publisher = [[Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc]] | date = 1990 | page = 263 }} &lt;/ref&gt; They are sometimes referred to as the ''Head Electrician'' or in a touring house, the ''House Electrician''. Their other duties include:

*Planning and implementing of the cabling (circuiting) of lights and electric power distribution for any given show or production. 
*Inventory and repair and maintenance of all stage lighting fixtures, cables, effects, power distribution, dimmers, networking and lighting control consoles. 
*Organization and purchasing of all consumables including [[Color_gel|gels]], [[Gobo_(lighting)|gobos]], and [[gaffer tape|gaff tape]]. 
*Documenting and tracking of all scenery, circuiting, addressing, and system configuration in cooperation with the Lighting Designer. 
*If there are no light board ops, the Master Electrician may need to patch the board according to the L.D.'s designs.
*Solving any problems or issues with the electrical equipment that the Deck Electricians cannot resolve by themselves.
*Occupational safety and health of workers and operational decisions as the Head of the Electrics department.

=== Lighting programmer ===
The '''lighting programmer''', is a person familiar with the lighting board being used who sits next to or in communication with the lighting designer during "tech". He or she is responsible for programming in the lighting cues as dictated to him or her by the lighting designer. This saves the designer the time and attention of using the light board and allows him or her to concentrate on building the cues. Often, especially in smaller theatres, this person is the Light Board Operator for the show's run.

=== Moving light programmer ===
The '''moving light programmer''' is a person who specializes in the sometimes complex creation of cues for [[Intelligent lighting|moving lights]]. For large productions with several moving lights, there may even be a separate control system for the moving lights from that of the "conventional" lighting. Some of these lights, in addition to being able to change focus from one location to another, can include many other features such as color and patterns. The coordinating of these fixtures can be complex enough to require a dedicated person to program.

=== Followspot operator ===
{{main|Spotlight operator}}
The ''' followspot operator''' is the person who operates the [[Spotlight (theatre lighting)|followspot]], or spotlight on a production. This is a light which is physically moved by the operator during the production to follow a performer's movement around the stage. A follow spot may also have mechanisms to change color, as well as an iris to change the diameter of the projected circle of light. The followspot operator may have to change several aspects of the beam from their unit simultaneously. This position is more common in [[musical theatre]] and concerts than for drama.

'''''Flora Graeca''''' was a publication of the plants of [[Greece]] in the late 18th century, resulting from a survey by [[John Sibthorp]] and [[Ferdinand Bauer]].  The botanical descriptions and illustrations were to become highly valued by the English audience; the finely crafted and illustrated work was of both scientific and horticultural interest.

Sibthorp met the [[botanical illustrator]] Bauer in Vienna, where he had made a voyage to study a copy of [[Dioscorides]]' early botanical work, the renowned [[Vienna Dioscurides]]. This was the first part of a journey, to identify medicinal plants used in Greece;  Bauer was to join the expedition as the illustrator. They were to record and collect a large number of novel specimens; their publication introduced these to an English audience. From March 1786 to December 1787 they surveyed the plants and animals of the eastern [[Mediterranean]], Sibthorp collecting and describing, Bauer making dried specimens and producing colour-coded sketches.  Bauer's work, including around a thousand intricate and annotated sketches, is now regarded as one of the finest examples of [[botanical illustration]].

Sibthorp's volumes were to become a botanical publication, the original intention to produce a [[herbal]] or medical volume was transformed into a scientific survey.  An accompanying volume, ''Fauna Graeca'', and other planned works on the region, was not realised.

Sibthorp assembled the descriptions and [[Lithography|plates]], at his death in 1796 his will included an endowment to see the book published.  The task of preparing the works was undertaken by [[James Edward Smith]], who issued the two volumes of the '''''Prodromus''''' in 1806 and 1813, and six volumes as '''''Flora Graeca Sibthorpiana''''' between 1806 and 1828. The seventh appeared in 1830, after Smith's death, and the remaining three were produced by [[John Lindley]] between 1833 and 1840.
E
Each volume contained a hundred plates, except the last, and these were engraved by [[James Sowerby]]. Only 30 copies of this set were issued, another 50 complete sets were reissued in 1845 by [[Henry George Bohn]]. The cost in 1830 was 620 pounds.  The scarcity of the early first editions led to doubt of their existence, the rare book is at the higher end of trade.  The inherent value has led the [[Bodleian Libraries]] to make available a digital scan of the complete set.

The publication was issued with tables and indices of the scientific name, the common name in Greek was in this concordance.
It was during a period of increasing interest in horticulture and highly desired exotic species were described, many would become perennials of the English [[flower garden]].

{{italic title}}[[Image:Agape feast 05.jpg|thumb|''Fractio panis'', in the [[Catacombs of Rome]]]]
'''''Fractio Panis''''' (English: ''Breaking of Bread'') is the name given to a [[fresco]] in the Greek Chapel (''Capella Greca'') in the [[Catacomb of Priscilla]], situated on the [[Via Salaria]] Nova in [[Rome]].  The fresco depicts seven persons at a table, six men and a woman.  Like the whole of the decorations of the chapel, the fresco dates from the first half of the 2nd century. The painting is found upon the face of the arch immediately over the altar tomb, upon which the sacrament of the [[Eucharist]] was performed.

==Discovery==
By chance this particular fresco, having been covered by a thick crust of [[stalactite]]s, escaped the notice of the early explorers of the catacombs. In 1893, [[Jesuit]] art historian Joseph Wilpert, one of a band of young scholars who looked upon [[Giovanni Battista de Rossi|De Rossi]] as their master, arrived at the conclusion that the roof and arches of this chapel were decorated with frescoes. Chemical reagents were used to remove the crust which covered the surface, and by the patient care of Wilpert this delicate operation was attended with complete success.  De Rossi described it as "the pearl of Catacomb discoveries".  Wilpert published a monograph in 1895 giving a full account of this discovery under the title ''Fractio Panis, die alteste Darstellung der eucharistischen Opfers'' (Freiburg in Breisgau).  This was translated into French the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It contains a collection of very carefully executed [[photogravure]]s of the frescoes in the ''Capella Greca''.

The scene represented is a picture of seven persons at a table, six men and a woman. It seems clear that six of these are reclining as the ancients reclined at their meals. But the seventh personage, a bearded and impressive figure, sits somewhat apart at the extremity of the table. His head is thrown back, he has a small loaf or cake in his hands, and his arms stretched out in front of him show that he is breaking it. Upon the table immediately before him is a two-handled cup. Further along the table there are two large plates, one containing two fishes, the other five loaves. At each extremity of the picture upon either side we notice baskets filled with loaves—four baskets at one end, three at the other.

==Interpretation==
The phrase "fractio panis" (Greek: ''klasis tou artou'') and its variants is not found in pagan literature but recurs frequently in early Christian literature, indicating particular Christian usage;&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Barry M., ''Fractio Panis: A History of the Breaking of Bread in the Roman Rite'', Studia Anselmiana 151/Analecta Liturgica 29, Rome: Pontificio Ateneo S. Anselmo [Sankt Ottilien: EOS], 2011. {{ISBN|978-3-8306-7426-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; not only is the "blessing and breaking" of the bread mentioned in each of the four accounts of the Last Supper, but repeatedly also in the other Apostolic writings. For example, in [[First Letter to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]], 10:16, "The cup of benediction, which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? And the bread, which we break, is it not the partaking of the body of the Lord?" So again in [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]], 2:42, "And they were persevering in the doctrine of the apostles and in the communication of the breaking of bread, and in prayers" (cf. Acts, 2:46). And particularly Acts, 2:7, "And on the first day of the week, when we were assembled to break bread", where this practice is closely associated with the observance of Sunday. (Cf. also the disciples at [[Emmaus]] on [[Easter Day]]--Luke 24:30-35, and Acts, 27:35). 

Similar prominence is given to this conception in other sub-Apostolic writings, notably in the [[Didache]] or "Teaching of the Apostles" (xiv, I), where it is associated with the observance of the Sunday as well as with the explicit mention of Sacrifice and with confession. "And on the Lord's day come together and break bread and give thanks, having first confessed your transgressions, that your sacrifice may be pure." Further, in ch. xi of the same early treatise the consecrated Host is clearly designated by the term ''klasma'', i.e. "broken bread". It seems natural than that, in the earliest form of the liturgy, the breaking of the bread should have been regarded as the climax of the ritual employed. This Eucharistic significance of the picture is borne out by all the accessories. The loaves and the fishes upon the table point directly to the [[Feeding the multitude]] twice performed by [[Jesus Christ]]. The association of this miracle with the Eucharist is familiar, not only in other archaeological monuments, but also in early Christian literature.&lt;ref&gt;See for example [[Origen]], "In Matt.", x, 25 (P.G. XIII, 902), and [[Ambrose]], "De Virgin.", I, 3 (P.L. , XVI, 219).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Regarding the symbolic significance of the fish and the anagram [[ichthys]], both the [[Inscription of Abercius]] of the close of the 2nd century and that of [[Diocese of Autun|Autun]] a little later, as well as the large number of allusions in early Christian literature, make it clear that Christ was indicated by this symbol.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. Mowat in the "Atti del Congresso Internnaz. d'Archeol. Crist.", Rome, 1902, pp. 2-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, the Abercius inscription clearly conveys that this "great fish" was to be the permanent food of the soul. We may also note that the one female fixture among the guests depicted in the ''Fractio Panis'' fresco is veiled, which is not the case with the female figures represented in those other banqueting scenes found in the catacombs and usually interpreted as symbolic of the joys of heaven.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} 

The fresco is neither entirely realistic or entirely symbolical. That the president (''proestos'') of the [[Synaxis]] (assembly) should break the bread seated, is probably not to be understood as implying that the bishops in the early Church were in fact seated when they offered the liturgy any more than the attitude of the guests implies that the early Christians reclined on couches when they assisted at Eucharist. On the other hand, the action of the breaking of the bread is clearly realistic. A further indication of the Eucharistic significance of the fresco is afforded by the fact that in the fresco next to it in the same chamber is depicted the [[Binding of Isaac]]. On the other side is a representation of [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] in the lions' den, to which Wilpert also attaches a Eucharistic significance on account of the supernatural feeding of Daniel through the intervention of the prophet [[Habakkuk]] (Daniel, 14:36).

Some art historians, for instance Dorothy Irvin, have viewed the fresco as archaeological evidence that women presided over the Eucharist in the early Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''hound''' or '''dog''' (also ''levrier, leverer''; French ''lévrier;&lt;ref&gt;in French heraldry, the ''lévrier'' is the collared greyhound;  the greyhound without collar is called ''levron'', and the female greyhound, i.e. a greyhound shown without penis, is called ''levrette''. d'Haucourt &amp; Durivault, ''Le Blason'' 4th ed. (1965).&lt;/ref&gt; dogue, chien'') is used as a [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] in classical [[heraldry]].
In [[English heraldry]], the  commonly used variant are  the ''[[talbot (dog)|talbot]]'', also blazoned as ''sleuth-hound'', e.g. in the arms of [[Wolseley baronets|Wolseley]] of [[Staffordshire]], the  ''[[greyhound]]'' and ''[[bloodhound]]''.
Rarely-seen variants are the ratch-hound, the mastiff (''alant'' or ''aland''&lt;ref&gt;Parker (1894): "[Span. alano., med. lat. Canes alani], a mastiff with short ears, appears to be used only as the supporter of the arms of Lord Dacre.  "About his char ther wenten white alauns."&amp;mdash;Chaucer, Knight's Tale. 2450."&lt;/ref&gt;), the foxhound, the spaniel and the terrier.
The "sea-dog" is a curious charge resembling the talbot but with scales, webbed feet and a broad tail, used in the arms of [[Baron Stourton|Stourton barony]], presumably originally depicting a [[beaver]] (as used in the [[Coat of arms of Oxford]]).&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies (1909:[https://archive.org/stream/completeguidetoh00foxdrich#page/204/mode/2up 204f])&lt;/ref&gt;
Similar charges include the ''wolf'' and the ''fox''.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies (1909:[https://archive.org/stream/completeguidetoh00foxdrich#page/196/mode/2up 196f])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[German heraldry]] distinguishes three variants of dogs: ''[[Sighthound|Windhund]]'' (greyhound), ''[[Deutsche Bracke|Bracke]]'' and ''[[:wikt:Rüde|Rüde]]'' (also ''[[Molosser|Dogge]]'').&lt;ref&gt;J. Siebmacher's grosses und allgemeines Wappenbuch, Einleitungsband, Abteilung B: Grundsätze der Wappenkunst verbunden mit einem Handbuch der heraldischen Terminologie ( M. Gritzner). Nürnberg: Bauer &amp; Raspe, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Attitude (heraldry)|Attitudes]] of the hound may be sejant, rampant, salient (its hind feet on the ground), passant (trippant), skipping, courant (sometimes blazoned "in full chase" or "in full course") or questing (i.e. pointing). The ears, tongue and claws may be in different tinctures. It is often shown gorged or collared.

An early example of a blazon involving a dog (''levrier'') is that of Sir Perez Burdeux in [[Walford's Roll]] (Harley MS. 6589, c. 1275): ''porte d'or ou ung lev'er de gules, ou le collere de sable ou le bordure de sable besante dor'' (i.e.: or  a hound gules collared sable, a border sable [[Roundel (heraldry)|besanty]] or).

'''''Lady Cockburn and Her Three Eldest Sons''''' (1775) is an [[oil on canvas]] [[portrait]] by [[Joshua Reynolds]]. Work began on the picture in 1773, and, in [[Grand Manner]] fashion, Reynolds exploited two classical paintings: the attitude of the child on the left was modelled on Cupid in [[Velázquez]]'s ''[[Rokeby Venus|Toilet of Venus]]'' whilst the general composition was inspired by [[Anthony van Dyck]]'s ''Charity''. The painting passed to Mister Cockburn's son George, and then to his daughter, Mister Hamilton, the wife of Sir James Hamilton.&lt;ref name=great&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CzQdLzuxWD4C&amp;pg=PA282&amp;dq=%22lady+cockburn%22&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA285,M1 Great Pictures as Seen and Described by Famous Writers], Esther Singleton, p285, 2007, accessed June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
It was bequeathed to London's [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] in 1906.&lt;ref name=ng&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/cgi-bin/WebObjects.dll/CollectionPublisher.woa/wa/work?workNumber=ng2077 Lady Cockburn and her Three Eldest Sons], [[National Gallery, London]]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting is one of the few signed by Reynolds: Lady Cockburn's dress bears his signature and the year 1775.&lt;ref name=great/&gt;

Lady Cockburn (Augusta Anne Ayscough, 1749–1837) was the daughter of [[Francis Ayscough]]&lt;ref name=burke/&gt; and his wife Anne. She married [[Sir James Cockburn, 8th Baronet|Sir James Cockburn]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|b|ər|n}}, [[Scottish English]]: {{IPA-endia|ˈkobʌɾn|}}) the 8th Baronet and became Lady Cockburn of [[Langton, County Durham|Langton]] in [[Berwick-upon-Tweed|Berwick]] in 1769.&lt;ref name=burke&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Cq8KAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA268&amp;lpg=PA268&amp;dq=ayscough+berwick+augusta&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fhCYrBUgAE&amp;sig=ANuOia0xH1Pox08WqTn3n6PvQZU&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=py4ySqe-AcOQjAftm5T5CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#PPA268,M1 A General and heraldic dictionary of the peerage and baronetage of the British Empire], p268, 1832, accessed June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was made as the result of a large marriage settlement of twenty thousand pounds which was arranged by her maternal uncle, [[George Lyttelton, 1st Baron Lyttelton|Sir George Lyttlelton]], her widowed mother and her brother George Edward Ayscough. The money was raised on her father's estate and included three houses in London and two farms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=046-ah&amp;cid=-1#-1 Marriage settlement], The National Archives, accessed June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Cockburn's first three sons are depicted in the portrait. The first son, [[Sir James Cockburn, 9th Baronet|James]] (b. 1771), became the 9th baronet and [[Governor of Bermuda]] (1811–1819), and her second son, [[George Cockburn|George]] (b. 1772) became an [[Admiral of the Fleet]] and the 10th Baronet. Her third son, [[Sir William Cockburn, 11th Baronet|William]] (b. 1773) became the [[Dean of York]], and her fourth son, Alexander (b. 1776), became [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Ambassador#Extraordinary postings|envoy extraordinary]] and minister [[plenipotentiary]] to [[Württemberg]] and the [[Columbia District]] whilst her fifth son, [[Francis Cockburn|Francis]], (b. 1776) became a general after being involved in the early history of Canada as a colony and serving in diplomatic positions in the Bahamas and British Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=4357 Cockburn, Sir Francis], Dictionary of Canadian Biography, accessed June 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Cockburn's daughter, Augusta, was wed in 1807.&lt;ref name=burke/&gt;

The '''Lion of Al-lāt''' ([[Arabic]] اللات) is an ancient statue that adorned the [[Temple of Al-Lat]] in [[Palmyra]], [[Syria]]. On 27 June 2015, it was [[Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL|severely damaged]] by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] after it had [[Palmyra offensive (2015)|captured Palmyra]].&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/02/isis-militants-destroy-palmyra-stone-lion-al-lat|title=Isis militants destroy 2,000-year-old statue of lion at Palmyra|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was removed to the [[National Museum of Damascus]] and underwent reconstruction work, and now stands again.&lt;ref name="restored"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sana.sy/en/?p=114930|title=Restoration works of Palmyra’s famous ancient statue of Lion of Allat completed – Syrian Arab News Agency|website=sana.sy|language=en-US|access-date=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The statue, of a lion holding a crouching gazelle, was made from [[limestone]] [[ashlar]]s in the early first century A.D. and measured {{convert|3.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height,&lt;ref name="Butcher"&gt;{{cite book|title=Roman Syria and the Near East|author=Kevin Butcher|publisher=Getty Publications|year=2003|isbn=0892367156|page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; weighing 15 tonnes.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt; The lion was regarded as the consort of Al-lāt.&lt;ref name="Butcher" /&gt; The gazelle symbolized Al-lāt's tender and loving traits, as bloodshed was not permitted under penalty of Al-lāt's retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Commemorative Figures|author=Theodorus Petrus van Baaren|publisher=Brill Archive|year=1982|isbn=9004067795|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lion's left paw had a partially damaged [[Palmyrene dialect|Palmyrene]] inscription (PAT 1122) which reads: ''tbrk ʾ''[''lt''] (Al-lāt will bless) ''mn dy lʾyšd'' (whoever will not shed) ''dm ʿl ḥgbʾ'' (blood in the sanctuary).&lt;ref&gt;Van Baaren (1982), p. 65 and Reinhard G.

== History ==
[[File:Damascus Museum lion.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Statue look before 2005 restoration.]]
The statue was discovered in 1977 by a group of Polish archeologists working under Dr. Michał Gawlikowski.&lt;ref name="Markowski"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.pcma.uw.edu.pl/fileadmin/pam/PAM_2004_XVI/248.pdf|title=The Lion of Allat in Palmyra New Museum Display Project|publisher=[[Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology]]| author=Bartosz Markowski| accessdate =3 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was
found in pieces, having been reused in antiquity for the temple's foundation.&lt;ref name="Markowski"/&gt; Subsequently, it was decided to reassemble the pieces in front of the entrance to the Palmyra Museum. The task was undertaken by restorer [[Józef Gazy]]. In 2005, it underwent restoration to eliminate problems from assemblage.&lt;ref name="Markowski"/&gt; Ultimately, the piece was restored in imitation of its original intended appearance – a relief jumping out from a wall.&lt;ref name="Markowski"/&gt; During the [[Syrian Civil War]] the statue was shielded with a metal plate and sandbags to protect it from fighting.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

On 27 June 2015, it was severely damaged by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] after it had [[Palmyra offensive (2015)|captured Palmyra]].&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; After the liberation of Palmyra by the Syrian army, Syria’s director-general of antiquities and museums Maamoun Abdulkarim declared that the pieces were still in place and it should be possible to put them back together, giving hopes for reconstruction.&lt;ref name="PostItalian"&gt;{{cite web | date=28 March 2016|url =http://www.ilpost.it/2016/03/28/palmira-prima-e-dopo-lisis/|title=Palmira prima e dopo l'ISIS|work=Il Post|language=Italian|access-date=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue was moved to Damascus in 2016, where it underwent complete restoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://tishreen.news.sy/?p=39218|title=تمثال أسد اللات.. من تدمر إلى المتحف الوطني في دمشق استعداداً لترميمه (In Arabic)|accessdate =21 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 October 2017, it was fully restored and is currently on display in the [[National Museum of Damascus]], until safety is assured in Palmyra to move it there again.&lt;ref name="restored" /&gt;

[[File:Lombardic capitals Ambraser Heldenbuch folio 75v.jpg|thumb|Lombardic capitals in a manuscript (the Ambraser Heldenbuch, fol. 75v, c.1516)]]
'''Lombardic capitals''' is the name given to a type of decorative [[Letter case|upper-case]] letters used in inscriptions and, typically, at the start of a section of text in medieval manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=David|title=The Art of Calligraphy: a practical guide to the skills and techniques|date=1995|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780751301496|pages=62–4|edition= 1st American}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Shaw describes it as a 'relative' of uncial writing.&lt;ref name="Black Letter Primer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Paul|title=Black Letter Primer: an introduction to Gothic alphabets|date=1982|publisher=Taplinger Pub.

[[File:Jenson De viris illustribus.jpg|thumb|Lombardic capitals in an early printed book ([[Cicero]]'s ''De viris illustribus'', [[Nicolas Jenson]] c.1470)]]
The term ''Lombardic'' comes from the study of [[Incunable|incunabula]].&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schneider|first1=Karin|title=Paläographie und Handschriftenkunde für Germanisten. Eine Einführung|date=2014|location=Berlin, Boston|isbn=978-3-11-033704-4|edition= 3rd|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lombardic Caps metal type.jpg|thumb|Goudy's Lombardic Capitals, metal type]]
A characteristic form of text decoration in manuscripts and early printed books with hand colouring was to use alternating red and blue Lombardic capitals for the start of each successive paragraph.&lt;ref name="Schneider" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hellinga|first1=Lotte|title=Incunabula in Transit: People and Trade|date=2018|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden, Boston|isbn=978-90-04-34036-7|pages=183–184|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CMZKDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike [[Historiated initial|historiated]] or [[inhabited initial]]s, Lombardic capitals are devoid of further decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Schneider|editor1-first=Ulrich Johannes|title=Textkünste. Buchrevolution um 1500.|date=2016|publisher=Wissenschafliche Buchgesellschaft|location=Darmstadt|isbn=978-3-8053-5100-3|page=219|edition= 2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, fonts of Lombardic capitals have been designed by many [[typographers]], such as [[Frederic Goudy]], who included a set as an alternative uppercase for his Goudy Text font.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goudy Text Lombardic Capitals|url=https://catalog.monotype.com/font/monotype/goudy-text/lombardic-capitals|publisher=Monotype|accessdate=27 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=First, Lombardic, or the national hand of Italy, which was a development of the uncial and was first used in northern Italy. The Lombardic character is a most useful and interesting form and presents less of the fixed quality of the Roman. There are many and wide variations of it as developed by the scribes in different countries. It was the favorite form selected for initials and versals in manuscripts, which were usually painted in, in colors and gold, the solidity of the bodystrokes making it especially adaptable for this purpose. At its best this Lombardic letter preserves much of the feeling of the uncials of the sixth and seventh centuries.

'''Long-nosed god maskettes''' are [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] made from bone, [[copper]] and marine shells ([[Lightning whelk]]) associated with the [[Mississippian culture]] (800 to 1600 CE) and found in [[archaeological site]]s in the American Midwest and Southeast. They are small shield-shaped faces with squared-off foreheads, circular eyes, and large noses of various lengths. They are often shown on [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]] representations of falcon impersonators as ear ornaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.museum.state.il.us/muslink/nat_amer/pre/htmls/miss.html|title=Native American:Prehistoric:Mississippian|accessdate=2010-07-30|publisher=Illinois State Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long and short nosed versions of the masks have been found in ten different states, with the majority found at sites in Illinois.&lt;ref name=LONG&amp;SHORT&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://lithiccastinglab.com/gallery-pages/2005octobergodmaskpage1.htm|title=Long &amp; Short Nosed God Masks|accessdate=2010-07-30|date=2005-09-30 |first=Peter A.|last= Bostrom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many archaeologists now associate them with the [[Ho-Chunk]] (Winnebago) stories of the mythological being [[Red Horn (Siouan deity)|Red Horn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=War Paths, Peace Paths: An Archaeology of Cooperation and Conflict in Native Eastern North America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fegpXvByVnQC&amp;pg=PA152&amp;dq=long-nosed+god+shell+maskettes&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rIBXTPapOIKB8gazwsW2BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=long-nosed%20god%20shell%20maskettes&amp;f=false|first=David H.|last=Dye|date=2009-02-16|publisher=AltaMira Press|isbn=978-0-7591-0745-8|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long nosed god horizon===
Archaeologists have long used the maskettes for dating different phases of the Mississippian culture. In the 1950s [[Stephen Williams (archeologist)|Stephen Williams]] and [[John Mann Goggin]] proposed the existence of an early Mississippian ''Long nosed god horizon'' based on the distribution and chronological positioning of the finds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_7737/is_200907/ai_n39230890/|title= CORRECTED PROVENANCE FOR THE LONG-NOSED GOD MASK FROM "A CAVE NEAR ROGANA, TENNESSEE"|accessdate=2010-07-30 | work=Southeastern Archaeology | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 Jon Muller of [[Southern Illinois University]] proposed reorganizing the classification of the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Theories and names|Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]] into five [[Archaeological horizon|horizons]], with each as a discrete tradition defined by the origin of specific motifs and ritual objects. The first horizon he defines for his [[Mississippian Ideological Interaction Sphere]] is the ''Developmental Cult Period'' which went from 900 to 1150 CE and is marked by the appearance of the Long nosed god maskettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor= Galloway, Patricia|author =Muller, Jon|  title=The Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, Artifacts and Analysis:The Cottonlandia Conference| article = The Southern Cult | publisher = University of Nebraska Press| year = 1989 | pages = 11–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories about uses==
[[File:Spiro Big Boy effigy pipe HRoe 02.jpg|thumb|upright|"Resting Warrior" from Spiro with short nosed god maskette earring]]
{{cquote|''The long-nosed god maskettes may have functioned in the Early Mississippian Period of the eastern United States within an adoption ritual much like that of the Calumet ceremony of the historic period.----to create fictions of kinship between the powerful leader of a large polity and his political clients in outlying areas.

Some archaeologists, including [[James Bennett Griffin|James B. Griffin]] of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], at first believed that the Long-nosed god masks were evidence of contact with [[Mesoamerica]]. They identified the masks as possible representations of the [[Aztec]] deity [[Yacatecuhtli]],&lt;ref name=FULLER2008&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://users.stlcc.edu/mfuller/indianhill.html | title=Indian Hill Mound in St. Louis County, Missouri| accessdate=2010-08-01|year=2008|author=Fuller, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; an aspect of [[Quetzalcoatl]] whose name means “The Lord Who Guides”. Yacatecuhtli was worshipped by the [[pochteca]], a class of professional long-distance traveling merchants. In the 1990s anthropologist [[Robert L. Hall]] proposed that the maskettes were used by Mississippian peoples as part of ritual [[adoption]]s in which important leaders extended [[fictive kinship]] to visiting leaders in order to cement political alliances and trade relationships.&lt;ref name=TEJAS&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/fundamentals/images/prec41.html|title=Tejas| accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall, an expert on Native American belief systems, theorised that the maskettes were used to identify individuals involved in the adoption rituals with the figures of [[Red Horn (Siouan deity)|Red Horn]] (who was also known as "He-Who-Wears-Human-Heads-As-Earrings") and his sons.&lt;ref name=AZTALAN&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mpm.edu/collections/artifacts/anthropology/aztalan/outpost/|title=Aztalan – Wisconsin's Middle Mississippian Outpost|publisher=Milwaukee Public Museum|accessdate=2010-07-30|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527175058/http://www.mpm.edu/collections/artifacts/anthropology/aztalan/outpost/|archivedate=2010-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HALL1997&gt;{{cite book|

In his guise as "He who Gets Hit with Deer Lungs", Red Horn is also associated with the ''[[Calumet (pipe)|Calumet ceremony]]'', which is another fictive kinship/adoption ritual.&lt;ref name=DIETERLE&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia| title = Redhorn (Wears Faces on His Ears)|first=Richard L.|last= Dieterle| encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Hočąk (Winnebago) Mythology| accessdate = 2010-08-19|url=http://www.hotcakencyclopedia.com/ho.Redhorn.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The differing shapes of the noses found on earpieces, including long, bent and short varieties, are explained by the myths as differing stages of the ritualized adoption process. In one [[Caddo]]an myth, the "[[Feral child|wild brother]]" of the Hero Twins possesses a long nose which is magically shortened by a medicine man. This has led some researchers to think the masks start as the long nosed variety, denoting the first stage in the initiation process. As the individual progresses through the rituals, the nose is symbolically bent and eventually trimmed in the final phase, denoting full acceptance into the kinship system.&lt;ref name=DUNCAN2000/&gt;

'''''Nautilus''''' is a black-and-white photograph taken by [[Edward Weston]] in 1927 of a single [[nautilus]] shell standing on its end against a dark background. It has been called "one of the most famous photographs ever made" and "a benchmark of modernism in the history of photography."&lt;ref name=Sotheby&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/lot/LotDetail.jsp?sale_number=N08624&amp;live_lot_id=122 |title=Sotheby's: Edward Weston - Nautilus|accessdate=2011-01-05}}{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inspiration==
In February, 1927, Weston visited the studio of local [[Carmel-by-the-Sea|Carmel]] artist [[Henrietta Shore]] and noticed several paintings she had made of sea shells. Only one of these paintings is known to still exist (as of January, 2011), and it shows a stark and solitary nautilus on a dark field, not unlike Weston's resulting photographs.&lt;ref name=Aiken&gt;{{cite journal|first =Roger |last=Aikin  |date=Winter 1992 | title =Henrietta Shore and Edward Weston| journal =American Art | volume =6 | issue =1  | pages =42–61 | doi=10.1086/424140}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made it clear in his writings that the paintings had a profound effect on him:

{{quote|I was awakened to shells by the painting of Henry [Henrietta Shore]. I never saw a Chambered Nautilus before. If I had, my response would have been immediate. If I merely copy Henry's expression, my work will not live. If I am stimulated and work with real ecstasy it will live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward |last=Weston|editor=Nancy Newhall |title= The Daybooks of Edward Weston, Volume II|publisher=NY: Horizon Press |year=1961| pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Photographing==
Within a month he began photographing several different large chambered nautiluses, either whole or cut in half to reveal their inner structure.  He used his Ansco 8 × 10 Commercial view camera with a Rapid Rectilinear lens stopped down to US256 (equivalent to f/64) . Notations he made about his exposures during this period indicate that the film he used would be rated approximately equivalent to 16 on today's [[Film speed|ISO scale]].&lt;ref name=Newhall&gt;{{cite book| first=Beaumont |last=Newhall|title=" Edward Weston's Technique", in Edward Weston Omibus|publisher=Layton, UT: Gibbs Smith|year=1984|ISBN=0-87905-131-0|pages=109–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the technical limitations of the film and the camera he used, he was forced to make extremely long exposures that were easily ruined by vibrations. Weston's grandson [[Kim Weston]] said his grandfather propped up the shell on the end of an oil drum (the arc of the drum can barely be seen in the background of the image),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.beautiful-landscape.com/Thoughts24.html |title=Notes on Photographing a - Nautilus|accessdate=2011-01-05|first=Brian |last=Pawlowski}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the thin metal oil drum head was sensitive to the slightest movement. Weston expressed his frustrations in his 'Daybooks'':

:Wednesday, June 15: "Yesterday I tried again: result, movement! The exposure was 4{{fraction|1|2}} hours, so to repeat was no joy, with all the preoccupation of keeping quiet children and cat, ‒ but I went ahead and await development."

:The next day: "The shells again moved! It must be the heavy trucks that pass jar the building ever so slightly. Anyway, I have quit trying: I can afford no more film." &lt;ref&gt;Daybooks, II, p28&lt;/ref&gt;

He recorded that over the next several months he made fourteen negatives of shells. It's not known exactly when he took this particular image, but it had to have been made between April 1 and June 8, 1927, when he recorded in his journal "Last evening I had printed, and am ready to show all shell negatives…".&lt;ref&gt;Daybooks, II, 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction==

''Nautilus'' is now recognized as one of Weston's greatest photographs, but all of his images of shells have a greater-than-life quality to them. Weston biographer Ben Maddow has said that what is so remarkable about them "is not in the closeness nor in the monumentality of the forms; or at least, not in these alone. It is instead in the particular light, almost an inward luminescence, that he saw implicit in them before he put them before the lens. Glowing with an interior life . .. one is seeing more than form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Den |last=Maddow |title= Edward Weston: Fifty Years|publisher=NY: Aperture|year=1973| page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One historian wrote "The nautilus shells proved a turning point in Weston’s career and marked a critical phase in his development as one of the greatest photographers of the 20th century, a pioneering modernist whose stunning simplicity and technical mastery are often imitated but never quite equaled." &lt;ref name=Sotheby2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photoinduced.com/144/edward-weston-exhibit/ |title=Debunking the Myth of Edward Weston |first=Deborah |last=Hornblow |accessdate=2011-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113135932/http://www.photoinduced.com/144/edward-weston-exhibit/ |archivedate=2011-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;"

Much has been said about Weston's intentions in photographing shells.  He recorded that some of the first people to see them had intensely erotic reactions:

:[[Tina Modotti]]: Edward ‒ nothing in art has affected like these photographs. I cannot look at them very long without feeling exceedingly perturbed, they disturb me not only mentally but physically. There is something so pure and at the same time so perverse about them…, They are mystical and erotic."&lt;ref name="DB II 31"&gt;Daybooks, II, p31&lt;/ref&gt;

:[[Diego Rivera]] (as described by Tina Modotti): "These photographs are biological, beside the aesthetic emotion they disturb me physically, ‒ see my forehead is sweating. Then ‒ 'Is W. very sensual?'"&lt;ref name="DB II 31"/&gt;

:[[Rene d'Harnoncourt]] (as described by Tina Modotti): "Without my saying a word he used 'erotic' also. Like me, he expressed the disturbance these prints caused in him. He felt 'weak at the knees'."&lt;ref name="DB II 31"/&gt;

At the same time, Weston strongly denied in his writings that he had any thought, much less intention, of recording erotic symbolism:

:"No! I had no physical thoughts, ‒ never have. I worked with clearer decision of sheer aesthetic form. I knew I was recording from within, my feeling for life as I never has before. Or better, when the negatives were actually developed, I realized what I felt, ‒ for when I worked, I was never more unconscious of what I was doing.

:No! The Shells are too much a sublimation of all of my works and life to be pigeon-holed. Others must get from them what they bring to them: evidently they do!"&lt;ref&gt;Daybooks, II, p32&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, in another entry about one of his nude images he said "I saw the repeated curves of thigh and calf, ‒ the shin bone, knee and thigh lines forming shapes not unlike great sea shells…"&lt;ref&gt;Daybooks, II, p10&lt;/ref&gt;

Weston wrote that he made twenty-eights prints of this image on at least four different types of paper,&lt;ref name=Conger&gt;{{cite book|first=Amy |last=Conger|title= Edward Weston: Photographs from the Center for Creative Photography|publisher=Tucson: Center for Creative Photography |year=1992| pages=Fig. 544}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a matte Kodak Azo and a semi-gloss Agfa Convira. In a few early versions he extended the bottom margin of the image down to the notches on the film negative.&lt;ref&gt;Conger, Fig. 544&lt;/ref&gt; Most prints measure approximately 9{{fraction|1|2}} by 7{{fraction|1|2}} in. (24 by 19&amp;nbsp;cm.)

On April 13, 2010, a print of this image made by Weston in year it was taken sold for $1,082,500 at an auction in New York. As of January, 2013, it was the fourteenth [[List of most expensive photographs|most expensive photograph]] ever sold. Weston originally sold it for $10.

Prints of this image are now in the collections of the [[Center for Creative Photography]], the [[George Eastman House]] and the [[Museum of Modern Art]].

Something about the Author. Ed. by Alan Hedblad. Vol. 112. Detroit: Gale Group, 2000. Pp. 160-164.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its publication, Kirkus Reviews praised it, saying that "there's a harmony about this book -- the telling of familiar episodes from the Paul Bunyan legend, the homespun look of the paper, the virility of the line illustrations. . . . [A] book to read aloud."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/glen-rounds-21/ol-paul-the-mighty-logger-2/&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the seventeen books selected in the inaugural class of [[Lewis Carroll Shelf Award]] recipients in 1958.

'''The psychology of art''' is an interdisciplinary field that studies the [[perception]], [[cognition]] and characteristics of art and its production. For the use of [[art materials]] as a form of [[psychotherapy]], see [[art therapy]].  The psychology of art is related to [[architectural psychology]] and [[environmental psychology]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

The work of [[Theodor Lipps]], a Munich-based research psychologist, played an important role in the early development of the concept of ''art psychology'' in the early decade of the twentieth century.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} His most important contribution in this respect was his attempt to theorize the question of Einfuehlung or "[[empathy]]", a term that was to become a key element in many subsequent theories of ''art psychology''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

== History ==

===1880-1950===
One of the earliest to integrate psychology with [[art history]] was [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] (1864–1945), a Swiss art critic and historian, whose dissertation ''Prolegomena zu einer Psychologie der Architektur'' (1886) attempted to show that architecture could be understood from a purely psychological (as opposed to a historical-progressivist) point of view.&lt;ref name=Jarzombek&gt;[[Mark Jarzombek]]. ''The Psychologizing of Modernity'' (Cambridge University Press, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important figure in the development of art psychology was [[Wilhelm Worringer]], who provided some of the earliest theoretical justification for expressionist art. The Psychology of Art (1925) by [[Lev Vygotsky]] (1896–1934) is another classical work. [[Richard Müller-Freienfels]] was another important early theorist.&lt;ref name="RMF"&gt;{{cite book | title=Psychologie der Kunst | author=Müller-Freienfels, R | publisher=Teubner | location=Leipzig, Germany | year=1923 | url=https://archive.org/details/psychologiederk00fregoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Numerous artists in the twentieth century began to be influenced by the psychological argument, including [[Naum Gabo]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and somewhat [[Josef Albers]] and [[György Kepes]]. The French adventurer and film theorist [[André Malraux]] was also interested in the topic and wrote the book [[La Psychologie de l'Art]] (1947-9) later revised and republished as ''The Voices of Silence''.

===1950-present===
Though the disciplinary foundations of art psychology were first developed in Germany, there were soon advocates, in psychology, the arts or in philosophy, pursuing their own variants in the USSR, England ([[Clive Bell]] and [[Herbert Read]]), France ([[André Malraux]], [[Jean-Paul Weber]], for example), and the US.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}

In the US, the philosophical premises of art psychology were strengthened—and given political valence—in the work of [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;Alan Ryan, ''John Dewey and the High Time of American Liberalism''. W.W. Norton 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Art as Experience'' was published in 1934, and was the basis for significant revisions in teaching practices whether in the kindergarten or in the university. Manuel Barkan, head of the Arts Education School of Fine and Applied Arts at Ohio State University, and one of the many pedagogues influenced by the writings of Dewey, explains, for example, in his book ''The Foundations of Art Education'' (1955), that the aesthetic education of children prepares the child for a life in a complex democracy. Dewey himself played a seminal role in setting up the program of the [[Barnes Foundation]] in Philadelphia, which became famous for its attempt to integrate art into the classroom experience.&lt;ref&gt;Wattenmaker, Richard J.; [[Distel, Anne]], et al. (1993). ''Great French Paintings from the Barnes Foundation''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. pp. 6, 13–14. {{ISBN|0-679-40963-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of art psychology between 1950 and 1970 also coincided with the expansion of art history and museum programs. The popularity of [[Gestalt psychology]] in the 1950s added further weight to the discipline. The seminal work was ''Gestalt Therapy: Excitement and Growth in the Human Personality'' (1951), that was co-authored by [[Fritz Perls]], Paul Goodman, and Ralph Hefferline. The writings of [[Rudolf Arnheim]] (born 1904) were also particularly influential during this period. His ''Toward a Psychology of Art'' (Berkeley: University of California Press) was published in 1966. [[Art therapy]] drew on many of the lessons of art psychology and tried to implement them in the context of ego repair.&lt;ref&gt;see for example: Arthur Robbins and Linda Beth Sibley, ''Creative Art Therapy''. (Brunner/Mazel, 1976).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marketing]] also began to draw on the lessons of art psychology in the layout of stores as well as in the placement and design of commercial goods.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, ''Creating images and the psychology of marketing communication'', Edited by Lynn R. Kahle &amp; Chung-Hyun Kim (Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Art psychology, generally speaking, was at odds with the principles of Freudian [[psychoanalysis]] with many art psychologists critiquing, what they interpreted as, its reductivism [[Sigmund Freud]] believed that the creative process is an alternative to neuroses. He felt that it was likely a sort of defence mechanism against the negative effects of neuroses, a way to translate that energy into something socially acceptable, which could entertain and please others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Jeff|title=Understanding Creativity: What Drives us to Create?|url=http://www.naturibeauty.com/understanding-creativity-drives-us-create/|publisher=Psychology of Beauty}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writings of [[Carl Jung]], however, had a favorable reception among art psychologists given his optimistic portrayal of the role of art and his belief that the contents of the personal unconscious and, more particularly, the collective unconscious, could be accessed by art and other forms of cultural expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Man and His Symbols |editor-last1=Jung |editor-first1=Carl |editor-first2=Marie-Luise |editor-last2=von Franz|year=1964 |publisher=Aldus Books Ltd. |location=London |isbn=0385052219 |oclc=224253 |titlelink=Man and His Symbols|pages=18–103 |chapter=Approaching the Unconscious|first=Carl|last=Jung}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Man and His Symbols |editor-last1=Jung |editor-first1=Carl |editor-first2=Marie-Luise |editor-last2=von Franz|year=1964 |publisher=Aldus Books Ltd. |location=London |isbn=0385052219 |oclc=224253 |titlelink=Man and His Symbols|pages=230–271 |chapter=Symbolism in the Visual Arts |last= Jaffe|first=Aniela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1970s, the centrality of art psychology in academy began to wane. Artists became more interested in [[psychoanalysis]]&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock (ed.), ''Psychoanalysis and the Image''. (Oxford: Blackwell. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[feminism]],&lt;ref&gt;Catherine de Zegher (ed.), ''Inside the Visible''. (MIT Press, Boston, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and architects in [[phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]] and the writings of [[Wittgenstein]], [[Lyotard]] and [[Derrida]]. As for art and architectural historians, they critiqued psychology for being anti-contextual and culturally naive. [[Erwin Panofsky]], who had a tremendous{{peacock term|date=June 2016}} impact on the shape of art history in the US, argued that historians should focus less on what is seen and more on what was thought.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Podro ''The Critical Historians of Art'' (Yale University Press, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dana Arnold and Margaret Iverson (eds.) ''Art and Thought''. Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, psychology still plays an important role in art discourse, though mainly in the field of art appreciation.&lt;ref name=Jarzombek/&gt;

Because of the growing interest in personality theory—especially in connection with the work of Isabel Briggs Myers and Katherine Briggs (developers of the [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]])—contemporary theorists are investigating the relationship between personality type and art. Patricia Dinkelaker and John Fudjack have addressed the relationship between artists’ personality types and works of art; approaches to art as a reflection of functional preferences associated with personality type; and the function of art in society in light of personality theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tap3x.net/EMBTI/j7readintro.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetic Experience==

Art is considered to be a subjective field, in which one composes and views artwork in unique ways that reflect one’s experience, knowledge, preference, and emotions.  The aesthetic experience encompasses the relationship between the viewer and the art object.  In terms of the artist, there is an emotional attachment that drives the focus of the art.  An artist must be completely in-tune with the art object in order to enrich its creation.&lt;ref name="M &amp; S"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/a0014292|title=An experiential account of the psychology of art|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|volume=3|issue=3|pages=181–187|year=2009|last1=Sullivan|first1=Paul|last2=McCarthy|first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the piece of art progresses during the creative process, so does the artist.  Both grow and change to acquire new meaning.  If the artist is too emotionally attached or lacking emotional compatibility with a work of art, then this will negatively impact the finished product.&lt;ref name="M &amp; S"/&gt;  According to Bosanquet (1892), the "aesthetic attitude" is important in viewing art because it allows one to consider an object with ready interest to see what it suggests.  However, art does not evoke an aesthetic experience unless the viewer is willing and open to it.  No matter how compelling the object is, it is up to the beholder to allow the existence of such an experience.&lt;ref name="B &amp; S"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Lloyd E.|last1=Sandelands|first2=Georgette C.|last2=Buckner|chapter=Of Art and Work: Aesthetic Experience and the Psychology of Work Feelings|chapter-url=http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/lsandel/PDFs/Of%20Art%20and%20Work.pdf|title=Research in Organizational Behavior|volume=11|pp=105–131|isbn=9780892329212|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073948/http://webuser.bus.umich.edu/lsandel/PDFs/Of%20Art%20and%20Work.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the eyes of Gestalt psychologist Rudolf Arnheim, the aesthetic experience of art stresses the relationship between the whole object and its individual parts.  He is widely known for focusing on the experiences and interpretations of artwork, and how they provide insight into peoples' lives.  He was less concerned with the cultural and social contexts of the experience of creating and viewing artwork.  In his eyes, an object as a whole is considered with less scrutiny and criticism than the consideration of the specific aspects of its entity.  Artwork reflects one’s "lived experience" of his/her life.  Arnheim believed that all psychological processes have cognitive, emotional, and motivational qualities, which are reflected in the compositions of every artist.&lt;ref name="M &amp; S"/&gt;

==Psychological research==

===Overview: bottom-up and top-down processing===
Cognitive psychologists consider both "bottom-up" and "top-down" processing when considering almost any area of research, including vision.&lt;ref name=Lindell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lindell|first=Annukka K.|author2=Mueller, Julia |title=Can science account for taste? Psychological insights into art appreciation|journal=Journal of Cognitive Psychology|date=1 June 2011|volume=23|issue=4|pages=453–475|doi=10.1080/20445911.2011.539556}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Solso&gt;{{cite book|last=Solso|first=Robert L.|title=The psychology of art and the evolution of the conscious brain|year=2003|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262194848|pages=2–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cog text"&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson-Riegler|first=Bridget Robinson-Riegler, Gregory|title=Cognitive psychology : applying the science of the mind|publisher=Pearson Allyn &amp; Bacon|location=Boston|isbn=9780205033645|edition=3rd|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to how these terms are used in [[Top-down and bottom-up design|software design]], "bottom-up" refers to how information in the stimulus is processed by the visual system into colors, shapes, patterns, etc.&lt;ref name=Lindell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Solso /&gt; "Top-down" refers to conceptual knowledge and past experience of the particular individual.&lt;ref name=Lindell /&gt;&lt;ref name=Solso /&gt; Bottom-up factors identified in how art is appreciated include abstract vs figurative painting, form, complexity, symmetry and compositional balance, laterality and movement.&lt;ref name=Lindell /&gt; Top-down influences identified as being related to art appreciation include prototypicality, novelty, additional information like titles, and expertise.&lt;ref name=Lindell /&gt;

=== Abstract versus figurative art ===
[[Abstract paintings]] are unique in the explicit abandonment of representational intentions.&lt;ref name=Landau&gt;{{cite journal|last=Landau|first=Mark J.|author2=Greenberg, Jeff |author3=Solomon, Sheldon |author4=Pyszczynski, Tom |author5= Martens, Andy |title=Windows Into Nothingness: Terror Management, Meaninglessness, and Negative Reactions to Modern Art|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=1 January 2006|volume=90|issue=6|pages=879–892|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.90.6.879|pmid=16784340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Figurative or [[representational art]] is described as unambiguous or requiring mild interpretation.&lt;ref name=Landau /&gt;

==== The importance of meaning ====
The popular distaste for abstract art is a direct consequence of [[semantic ambiguity]].&lt;ref name=Landau /&gt; Researchers have examined the role of [[Terror management theory|terror management theory (TMT)]] concerning meaning and the aesthetic experience of abstract versus figurative art. This theory suggests that humans, like all life forms are biologically oriented toward continued survival but are uniquely aware that their lives will inevitably end. TMT reveals that modern art is often disliked because it lacks appreciable meaning, and is thus incompatible with the underlying terror management motive to maintain a meaningful conception of reality.&lt;ref name=Landau /&gt;  [[Mortality salience]], or the knowledge of approaching death, was manipulated in a study aimed at examining how aesthetic preferences for seemingly meaningful and meaningless art are influenced by intimations of mortality. The mortality salience condition consisted of two opened ended questions about emotions and physical details concerning the participant’s own death.&lt;ref name=Landau /&gt; Participants were then instructed to view two abstract paintings and rate how attractive they find them.  A t test comparing the mortality salience condition and the control found that participants in the mortality salience condition found the art less attractive.&lt;ref name=Landau /&gt;

The meaning maintenance model of sociology states that when a committed meaning framework is threatened, people experience an arousal state that prompts them to affirm any other meaning framework to which they are committed.&lt;ref name="Absurd art"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Proulx|first=T.|author2=Heine, S. J. |author3=Vohs, K. D. |title=When Is the Unfamiliar the Uncanny? Meaning Affirmation After Exposure to Absurdist Literature, Humor, and Art|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=5 May 2010|volume=36|issue=6|pages=817–829|doi=10.1177/0146167210369896|pmid=20445024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers sought to illustrate this phenomenon by demonstrating a heightened personal need for structure following the experience of abstract artwork.&lt;ref name="Absurd art" /&gt;  Participants were randomly assigned to a between-subjects viewing of artwork (abstract vs. representational vs. absurd artwork), followed by allocation of the Personal Need for Structure scale. Personal Need for Structure scale is used to detect temporary increases in people’s need for meaning.&lt;ref name="Absurd art" /&gt; Theoretically, one should experience more need for structure when viewing abstract art than figurative art since unrelated meaning threats (abstract art) evoke a temporarily heightened general need for meaning.&lt;ref name="Absurd art" /&gt; However, results showed that overall scores for representational art, and abstract art did not differ significantly from one another.  Participants reported higher scores on the Personal Need for Structure scale in absurd rather than abstract art. Yet, the question remains as to whether the same kinds of results would be obtained with an expanded sample of abstract expressionist or absurd images.&lt;ref name="Absurd art" /&gt;

==== Complexity ====

Studies have shown that when looking at abstract art, people prefer complexity in the work to a certain extent.  When measuring "interestingness" and "pleasingness," viewers rated works higher for abstract works that were more complex.  With added exposure to the abstract work, liking ratings continued to rise with both subjective complexity (viewer rated) and judged complexity (artist rated).  This was only true up to a certain point.  When the works became too complex, people began to like the works less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=237–249|doi=10.1037/h0082029|title=Preference for non-representational art as a function of various measures of complexity|journal=Canadian Journal of Psychology/Revue canadienne de psychologie|volume=29|issue=3|year=1975|last1=Nicki|first1=R. M.|last2=Moss|first2=Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Neural evidence ====
Neuroanatomical evidence from studies using [[fMRI]] scans of aesthetic preference show that representational paintings are preferred over abstract paintings.&lt;ref name=Neuro&gt;{{cite journal|title=Neuroanatomical correlates of aesthetic preference for paintings|journal=Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuropsychology|year=2004|volume=15|issue=5|pages=893–897|doi=10.1097/00001756-200404090-00032|last1=Vartanian|first1=Oshin|last2=Goel|first2=Vinod}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is displayed through significant activation of brain regions related to preference ratings.&lt;ref name=Neuro /&gt;  To test this, researchers had participants view paintings that varied according to type (representational vs. abstract) and format (original vs. altered vs. filtered). Behavioral results demonstrated a significantly higher preference for representational paintings.&lt;ref name=Neuro /&gt; A positive correlation existed between preference ratings and response latency. FMRI results revealed that activity in the right [[caudate nucleus]] extending to [[putamen]] decreased in response to decreasing preference for paintings, while activity in the left [[cingulate sulcus]], [[Gyri|bilateral occipital gyri]], [[Gyri|bilateral fusiform gyri]], [[Gyri|right fusiform gyrus]], and [[Cerebellum|bilateral cerebellum]] increased in response to increasing preference for paintings.&lt;ref name=Neuro /&gt;  The observed differences were a reflection of relatively increased activation associated with higher preference for representational paintings.&lt;ref name=Neuro /&gt;

Brain wave studies have also been conducted to look at how artists and non-artists react in different ways to abstract and representational art.  EEG brain scans showed that while viewing abstract art, non-artists showed less arousal than artists.  However, while viewing figurative art, both artists and non-artists had comparable arousal and ability to pay attention and evaluate the art stimuli.  This suggests abstract art requires more expertise to appreciate it than does figurative art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Style and spectral power: Processing of abstract and representational art in artists and non-artists|journal=Perception|date=11 June 2010|volume=39|issue=12|pages=1659–1671|doi=10.1068/p6747|pmid=21425703|author1=Batt|first1=R|last2=Palmiero|first2=M|last3=Nakatani|first3=C|last4=Van Leeuwen|first4=C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Personality type ====
Individual personality traits are also related to aesthetic experience and art preference. Individuals chronically disposed to clear, simple, and unambiguous knowledge express a particularly negative aesthetic experience towards abstract art, due to the void of meaningful content.&lt;ref name=Landau /&gt; Studies have provided evidence that a person’s choice of art can be a useful measure of personality.&lt;ref name=Personality&gt;{{cite journal |title=Personality and judgments of abstract, pop art, and representational paintings|journal=European Journal of Personality|year=2001|volume=15|issue=1|pages=57–72|doi=10.1002/per.340|last1=Furnham|first1=Adrian|last2=Walker|first2=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Individual personality traits are related to aesthetic experience and art preference. Testing personality after viewing abstract and representational art was performed on the [[NEO-Five Factor Inventory|NEO Five-Factor Inventory]] which measures the [[Big Five personality traits|“big five” factors of personality]].&lt;ref name=Personality /&gt;  When referencing the “Big Five” dimensions of personality, Thrill and Adventure Seeking were positively correlated with a liking of representational art, while Disinhibition was associated with positive ratings of abstract art. Neuroticism was positively correlated with positive ratings of abstract art, while Conscientiousness was linked to liking of representational art. Openness to Experience was linked to positive ratings of abstract and representational art.&lt;ref name=Personality /&gt;

==== Automatic evaluation ====

Studies looking at implicit, automatic evaluation of art works have investigated how people react to abstract and figurative art works in the split-second before they had time to think about it.  In implicit evaluation, people reacted more positively to the figurative art, where they could at least make out the shapes.  In terms of explicit evaluation, when people had to think about the art, there was no real difference in judgement between abstract and representational art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mastandrea|first=Stefano |author2=Bartoli, Gabriella |author3=Carrus, Giuseppe|title=The Automatic Aesthetic Evaluation of Different Art and Architectural Styles|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|date=May 2011|volume=5|issue=2|pages=126–134|doi=10.1037/a0021126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Laterality and movement ===

==== Handedness and reading direction ====

Laterality and movement in visual art includes aspects such as interest, weight, and balance. Many studies have been conducted on the impact of handedness and reading direction on how one perceives a piece of art. Research has been conducted to determine if hemispheric specialization or reading habits affect the direction in which participants “read” a painting. Results indicate that both factors contribute to the process. Furthermore, hemispheric specialization leads individuals to read from left to right, giving those readers an advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maass|first=A|author2=Russo, A |title=Directional bias in the mental representation of spatial events: nature or culture?|journal=Psychological Science|date=July 2003|volume=14|issue=4|pages=296–301|pmid=12807400|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.14421}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Building off of these findings, other researchers studied the idea that individuals who are accustomed to reading in a certain direction (right to left, versus left to right) would then display a bias in their own representational drawings reflecting the direction of their reading habits. Results indicated that this prediction held true, in that participants’ drawings reflected their reading bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vaid|first=Jyotsna|author2=Rhodes, Rebecca |author3=Tosun, Sumeyra |author4= Eslami, Zohra |title=Script Directionality Affects Depiction of Depth in Representational Drawings|journal=Social Psychology|volume=42|issue=3|pages=241–248|doi=10.1027/1864-9335/a000068|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers also looked to see if one’s reading direction, left to right or right to left affects one’s preference for either a left to right directionality or a right to left directionality in pictures. Participants were shown images as well as its mirror image, and were asked to indicate which they found more aesthetically pleasing. Overall, results indicate that one’s reading directionality impacts one’s preference for pictures either with left to right directionality or right to left directionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chokron|first=Sylvie|author2=De Agostini, Maria|title=Reading habits influence aesthetic preference|journal=Cognitive Brain Research|volume=10|issue=1–2|pages=45–49|doi=10.1016/S0926-6410(00)00021-5|pmid=10978691|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study, researchers examined if the right-side bias in aesthetic preference is affected by handedness or reading/writing habits. The researchers looked at Russian readers, Arabic readers, and Hebrew readers that were right handed and non-right-handed. Participants viewed pictures taken from art books that were profiles or human faces and bodies in two blocks. Images were shown to participants as inward or outward facing pairs and then in the opposite orientation. After viewing each pair, participants were asked which image of the pair was more aesthetically pleasing. When looking at the results for handedness, right-handed participants had "left preferences" and non right-handed participants had "right preferences". These results indicated that “aesthetic preference for facial and bodily profiles is associated primarily with the directionality of acquired reading/writing habits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nachson|first=I.|author2=Argaman, E. |author3=Luria, A. |title=Effects of Directional Habits and Handedness on Aesthetic Preference for Left and Right Profiles|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology|volume=30|issue=1|pages=106–114|doi=10.1177/0022022199030001006|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Reading direction seems to impact how people of all ages view artwork. Using kindergarten to college aged participants, researchers tested viewers’ aesthetic preference when comparing an original piece of art with its mirror image. The original paintings followed the convention that viewers "read" paintings from left to right; therefore, the patterns of light directed the audience to view the painting in the same manner. Findings indicated that participants preferred the original paintings, most likely due to the western style of viewing paintings from left to right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swartz|first=Paul|author2=Hewitt, David |title=Lateral organization in pictures and aesthetic preference|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|year=1970|volume=30|issue=3|pages=991–1007|doi=10.2466/pms.1970.30.3.991|pmid=5429349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lighting direction====

The direction of the lighting placed on a painting also seems to have an effect on aesthetic preference. The left-light bias is the tendency for viewers to prefer artwork that is lit with lighting coming from the left hand side of the painting. Researchers predicted that participants would prefer artwork that was lit from the left side and when given the option, they would choose to place lighting on the upper left side of a piece of artwork. Participants found paintings with lighting on the left to be more aesthetically pleasing than when it was lighter on the right side and when given the opportunity to create light on an already existing painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDine|first=David A.|author2=Livingston, Ian J. |author3=Thomas, Nicole A. |author4= Elias, Lorin J. |title=Lateral biases in lighting of abstract artwork|journal=Laterality: Asymmetries of Body, Brain and Cognition|volume=16|issue=3|pages=268–279|doi=10.1080/13576500903548382|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Left and right cheek bias====

The left cheek bias occurs when viewers prefer portraits with the subject displaying their left cheek, while those that hold a right cheek bias prefer portraits displaying the right cheek. Studies have found mixed results concerning the left cheek bias and the right cheek bias. Male and female participants were shown male and female portraits, each displaying an equal number of left or right cheek positions.  Participants were shown each portrait in its original orientation and in its reversed orientation and asked which portrait they preferred more. Results indicated that the majority of participants chose portraits displaying the subject’s right cheek over the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLaughlin|first=John P.|author2=Murphy, Kimberly E. |title=Preference for Profile Orientation in Portraits|journal=Empirical Studies of the Arts|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.2190/MUD5-7V3E-YBN2-Q2XJ|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study explored which posing orientations conveyed certain messages. Scientists in the 18th century{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} more commonly displayed a right cheek bias, and were rated as “more scientific.” According to the researchers, showing one’s right cheek hides emotion, while the left cheek expresses it. The shift from right to left cheek bias post 18th century may represent more personal or open facial characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=175–192|doi=10.1023/A:1020713416442|year=2002|last1=ten Cate|first1=Carel|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|volume=26|issue=3|title=Posing as Professor: Laterality in Posing Orientation for Portraits of Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity===

Complexity can literally be defined as being "made up of a large number of parts that have many interactions."&lt;ref name="Simon (Econ)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Simon|first=H. A.|title=The Sciences of the Artificial|year=1996|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition has been applied to many subjects, such as art, music, dance, and literature. In aesthetics research, complexity has been divided into three dimensions that account for the interaction between the amount of elements, differences in elements, and patterns in their arrangement. Furthermore, this characteristic in aesthetics consists of a wide spectrum, ranging from low complexity to high complexity. Key studies have found through [[Galvanic skin response]] that more complex artworks produce greater physiological arousal and higher hedonic ratings,&lt;ref name=Krupinski&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krupinski|first=E|author2=Locher, P |title=Skin conductance and aesthetic evaluative responses to nonrepresentational works of art varying in symmetry|journal=Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society|year=1988|volume=26|issue=4|pages=355–358|doi=10.3758/bf03337681}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is consistent with other findings that claim that aesthetic liking increases with complexity. Most important, several studies have found that there exists a [[#Inverse U-Shape hypothesis|U-shape]] relationship between aesthetic preference and complexity.&lt;ref name="Berlyne 1971"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berlyne|first=D.E.|title=Aesthetics and Psychobiology|year=1971|publisher=Appleton-Century-Crofts|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Measuring complexity====
In general, complexity is a something that has many parts in an intricate progression. Some researchers break complexity down into two different subparts: objective complexity and perceived complexity. Objective complexity is any part of art that could be manipulated. For visual art that may be the size of the shapes, the number of patterns, or the number of colors used. For acoustic art that could include duration, loudness, number of different harmonies, number of changes in rhythmic activity, and rate of rhythmic activity.&lt;ref name=Orr&gt;{{cite journal|last=Orr|first=Mark|author2=Ohlsson, Stellan |title=Relationship Between Complexity and Liking as a Function of Expertise|journal=Music Perception|year=2005|volume=22|issue=4|pages=583–611|doi=10.1525/mp.2005.22.4.583}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another form of complexity is perceived complexity, or subjective complexity. In this form each individual person rates an object on the complexity they perceive. Therefore, subjective complexity might depict our view of complexity more accurately, however, the measure may change from person to person.

One form of using computer technology to rate complexity, is by using computer intelligence when rating an image.&lt;ref name=Zhang&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=K.|author2=Harrell, S. |author3=Ji, X. |title=Computational Aesthetics: On the Complexity of Computer-Generated Paintings|journal=Leonardo|year=2012|volume=45|issue=3|pages=243–248|doi=10.1162/leon_a_00366}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this format, the amount of computer intelligence used is assessed when creating a digital image. Computer intelligence is assessed by recording the mathematic formulas used in creating the images. Human involvement, adding or taking away aspects of the image, could also add or take away from the complexity of the image.&lt;ref name=Zhang /&gt;

One way to measure complexity is to manipulate original artwork to contain various levels of density.  This process is done by subtracting and adding pixels to change the density of black and white paintings. This technique allowed researchers to use authentic artwork, instead of creating artificial versions of artwork, to control stimuli.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neperud|first=Ronald|author2=Marschalek |title=Informational and Affect Bases of Aesthetic Response|journal=Leonardo|year=1988|volume=21|issue=3|pages=305–31|doi=10.2307/1578660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still others find it best to measure complexity based on the number of parts an artwork has.&lt;ref name=Chamorro&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chamorro-Premuzic|first=T|author2=Burke, C. |title=Personality Predictors of Artistic Preferences as a Function of Emotional Valence and Perceived Complexity of Paintings|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics Creativity, and the Arts|year=2010|volume=4|issue=4|doi=10.1037/a0019211|pages=196–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; More aspects to the art, such as more colors, details, shapes, objects, sounds, melodies, and the like, create a more complex artwork. However, there is limited research done on the comparison between part based complexity and human perception of complexity, making it unclear if people perceive images with more parts as being more complex.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

====Inverse U-Shape hypothesis====

[[File:Inverted u.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Inverted-U Graph.]]
The Inverted U-Shape Hypothesis suggests that aesthetic responses in relation to complexity will exhibit an inverted-shape distribution.  In other words, the lowest ratings in aesthetic responses correlate with high and low levels of complexity, which displays an "avoidance of extremes". Furthermore, the highest level of aesthetic response occurs in the middle level of complexity.&lt;ref name="Berlyne 1971" /&gt; Previous studies have confirmed the U-Shape hypothesis (see Inverted U-graph image). For instance, in a study of undergraduates’ ratings of liking and complexity of contemporary pop music reported an inverted U-shape relationship between liking and complexity.&lt;ref name=North /&gt;

Previous research, suggest that this trend of complexity could also be associated with ability to understand, in which observers prefer artwork that is not too easy or too difficult to comprehend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=P. J.|title=What Is Interesting? Exploring the Appraisal Structure of Interest|journal=Emotion|year=2005|volume=5|issue=1|pages=89–102|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.5.1.89|pmid=15755222}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other research both confirms and disconfirms predictions that suggest that individual characteristics such as artistic expertise and training can produce a shift in the inverted U-shape distribution.&lt;ref name=North /&gt;

====Aspects of art====

;Visual art

A general trend shows that the relationship between image complexity and pleasantness ratings form an inverted-U shape graph (see [[#Art and expertise|Expertise]] section for exceptions). This means that people increasingly like art as it goes from very simple to more complex, until a peak, when pleasantness ratings being to fall again.

A recent study had also found that we tend to rate natural environment and landscape images as more complex, hence liking them more than abstract images that we rate as less complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forsythe|first=A|author2=Nadal, M. |author3=Sheehy, C. |author4=Cela-Conde, C. |author5=Sawey, M. |title=Predicting beauty: Fractal dimension and visual complexity in art|journal=British Journal of Psychology|year=2011|doi=10.1348/000712610X498958 |pmid=21241285|volume=102 |issue=1|pages=49–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Music
Music shows similar trends in complexity vs. preference ratings as does visual art. When comparing popular music, for the time period, and perceived complexity ratings the known inverted-U shape relationship appears, showing that generally we like moderately complex music the most.&lt;ref name=North&gt;{{cite journal|last=North|first=A.C.|author2=Hargreaves, D.J. |title=Subjective Complexity, Familiarity, and Liking for Popular Music|journal=Psychomusicology|year=1995|volume=14|pages=77–93|doi=10.1037/h0094090}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the music selection gets more or less complex, our preference for that music dips. People who have more experience and training in popular music, however, prefer slightly more complex music.&lt;ref name=North /&gt; The inverted-U graph shifts to the right for people a stronger musical background. A similar pattern can be seen for [[jazz]] and [[bluegrass music]].&lt;ref name=Orr /&gt; Those with limited musical training in jazz and bluegrass demonstrate the typical inverted-U when looking at complexity and preference, however, experts in those fields do not demonstrate the same pattern. Unlike the popular music experts, jazz and bluegrass experts did not show a distinct relationship between complexity and pleasantness. Experts in those two genres of music seem to just like what they like, without having a formula to describe their behavior. Since different styles of music have different effects on preference for experts, further studies would need to be done to draw conclusions for complexity and preference ratings for other styles.

;Dance

Psychological studies have shown that the hedonic likings of dance performances can be influenced by complexity. One experiment used twelve dance choreographies that consist of three levels of complexity performed at four different tempos. Complexity in the dance sequences were created varying the sequence of six movement patterns (i.e. circle clockwise, circle counterclockwise, and approach stage). Overall, this studied showed that observers prefer choreographies with complex dance sequences and faster tempos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodchilds|first=Jacqueline|author2=Thornton B. Roby |author3=Momoyo Ise |title=Evaluative reactions to the viewing of pseudo-dance sequences: Selected temporal and spatial aspects.|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|year=1969|volume=79|issue=1|pages=121–133|doi=10.1080/00224545.1969.9922395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal differences====

It has been found that personality differences and demographic differences may lead different art preferences as well. One study tested peoples preferences on various art pieces, taking into account their personal preferences as well. The study found that gender diffences exist in art preference. Women generally prefer happy, colorful, and simple paintings whereas men generally prefer geometric, sad, and complex paintings. An age difference in complexity preferences exists as well, where preference for complex paintings increases as age increases.&lt;ref name=Chamorro /&gt;

Certain personality traits can also predict the relationship between art complexity and preference.&lt;ref name=Chamorro /&gt; In one study it was found that people who scored high on conscientiousness liked complex painting less than people who scored low on conscientiousness. This falls in line with the idea that conscientious people dislike uncertainty and enjoy control, thereby disliking artwork that might threaten such feelings. On the other hand, people who scored highly on openness to experience liked complex artworks more than those who didn't score highly on openness to experience. Individual differences are better predictors for preference of complex art than simple art, where no clear personality traits predict preference for simple art. Although educational level did not have a direct relationship with complexity, higher educational levels led to more museum visits, which in turn led to more appreciation of complex art.&lt;ref name=Chamorro /&gt; This shows that more exposure to complex art leads to greater preference, where indeed familiarity causes greater liking.

===Symmetry===
Symmetry and beauty have a strong biological link that influences aesthetic preferences. It has been shown that humans tend to prefer art that contains symmetry, deeming it more beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tinio|first=P. P. L.|author2=Leder, H. |title=Just how stable are stable aesthetic features? Symmetry, complexity, and the jaws of massive familiarisation|journal=Acta Psychologica|year=2009|volume=130|issue=3|pages=241–250|doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2009.01.001|pmid=19217589}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, symmetry directly correlates to the understanding of a face or artwork as beautiful.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=B.|author2=Lisa, D.M. |author3=Little, A. |title=The role of symmetry in attraction to average faces|journal=Perception|year=2007|volume=69|issue=8|pages=1273–1277|doi=10.3758/BF03192944}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The greater the symmetry within the work or the face, generally the more beautiful it appears to be.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; Research on aesthetic preference for geometric forms and the fluent processing of symmetry sheds light on the role that symmetry plays in the overall aesthetic judgment and experience.

Humans innately tend to see and have a visual preference for symmetry, an identified quality yielding a positive aesthetic experience that uses an automatic bottom-up factor.&lt;ref name=Rentschler&gt;{{cite journal|title=Innate and learned components of human visual preference|journal=Current Biology|year=1999|volume=9|issue=13|pages=665–671|doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(99)80306-6|pmid=10395537|author1=Rentschler|first1=I|last2=Jüttner|first2=M|last3=Unzicker|first3=A|last4=Landis|first4=T}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bottom-up factor is speculated to rely on learning experience and visual processing in the brain, suggesting a biological basis.&lt;ref name=Rentschler/&gt; Many studies have ventured to explain this innate preference for symmetry with methods including the [[Implicit Association Test]] (IAT).&lt;ref name=Makin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Makin|first=Alexis D. J. |author2=Pecchineda, A. |author3=Bertamini, M.|title=Implicit Affective Evaluation of Visual Symmetry|journal=Emotion|year=2012|doi=10.1037/a0026924|pmid=22251051 |volume=12|issue=5 |pages=1021–1030}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that we may prefer symmetry because it is easy to process; hence we have a higher perceptual fluency when works are symmetrical.&lt;ref name=Reber&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reber|first=Rolf|author2=Schwarz, Norbert |author3=Winkielman, Piotr |title=Processing Fluency and Aesthetic Pleasure: Is Beauty in the Perceiver's Processing Experience?|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|date=1 November 2004|volume=8|issue=4|pages=364–382|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0804_3|pmid=15582859}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluency research draws on evidence from humans and animals that point to the importance of symmetry regardless of biological necessity. This research highlights the efficiency with which computers recognize and process symmetrical objects relative to non-symmetrical models.&lt;ref name=Reber/&gt; There have been investigations regarding the objective features that stimuli contain that may affect the fluency and therefore the preferences.&lt;ref name=Reber/&gt; Factors such as amount of information given, the extent of symmetry, and figure-ground contrast are only a few listed in the literature.&lt;ref name=Reber/&gt; This preference for symmetry has led to question on how fluency affects our implicit preferences by using the [[Implicit Association Test]]. Findings suggest that perceptual fluency is a factor that elicits implicit responses, as shown with the [[Implicit Association Test]] results.&lt;ref name=Makin/&gt; Research has branched from studying aesthetic pleasure and symmetry on an explicit but also implicit level. In fact, research tries to integrate [[priming (psychology)]], cultural influences and the different types of stimuli that may elicit an aesthetic preference.

Further research investigating perceptual fluency has found a gender bias towards neutral stimuli.&lt;ref name=Shepherd&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shepherd|first=Kathrine|author2=Bar, Moshe |title=Preference for symmetry: Only on Mars?|journal=Perception|year=2011|volume=40|issue=10|pages=1254–1256|doi=10.1068/p7057|pmid=22308897|pmc=3786096}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies pertaining to generalizing symmetry preference to real-world versus abstract objects allow us to further examine the possible influence meaning may have on preference for a given stimuli.&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt; In order to determine whether meaning mattered for a given stimuli, participants were asked to view pairs of objects and make a forced-choice decision, evaluating their preference.&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt; The findings suggest that an overall preference for symmetric features of visual objects existed. Furthermore, a main effect for gender preference existed in the males that consistently indicated a preference for symmetry in both abstract and real objects.&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt; This finding did not transcend in the female participants.&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt; Further studies need to be conducted to investigate the factors that influence female preferences for visual stimuli as well as for why males showed a preference for symmetry in both abstract and real world objects.&lt;ref name=Shepherd/&gt;

Art containing geometric forms, as seen in much of Islamic art, has an inherent symmetry to the work. This symmetry can be correlated to the attractiveness associated with the art form, since there is a correlation between human preference and symmetry.&lt;ref name=Cardenas&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cárdenas|first=R.A.|author2=Harris, L.J. |title=Symmetrical decorations enhance the attractiveness of faces and abstract designs|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|year=2006|volume=27|pages=1–18|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In studies regarding facial attractiveness, symmetry is found to be a significant factor as well as the shape and coloration in determining attractiveness. The [[sexy son hypothesis#Good genes theory|good genes hypothesis]] for symmetry preference argues that symmetry is a biological indicator of stable development, mate quality and fitness and therefore explains why we choose symmetrical traits in our mates.&lt;ref name=Cardenas/&gt; The [[sexy son hypothesis#Good genes theory|good genes hypothesis]] does not, however, explain why this phenomenon is observed in our preferences for decoration art.&lt;ref name=Cardenas/&gt; Another proposed hypothesis is the [[the extended phenotype|extended phenotype hypothesis]] that argues that decoration art is not mate-irrelevant but rather a reflection of the fitness of the artist, as symmetrical forms are difficult to produce.&lt;ref name=Cardenas/&gt; These hypothesis and findings provide evidence for evolutionary biases on preference for symmetry and as reinforcement for cultural biases.&lt;ref name=Cardenas/&gt; Research suggests that symmetrical preference due to its evolutionary basis, biological basis and cultural reinforcement, might be replicable cross-culturally.&lt;ref name=Cardenas/&gt;

===Compositional balance===
Compositional balance refers to the placement of various elements in a work of art in relation to each other, through their organization and positioning, and based upon their relative weights.&lt;ref name="Balance definition"&gt;{{cite web|last=Esaak|first=Shelley|title=Balance|url=http://arthistory.about.com/cs/glossaries/g/b_balance.htm|work=Education: Art History|publisher=About.com|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The elements may include the size, shape, color, and arrangement of objects or shapes. When balanced, a composition appears stable and visually right.&lt;ref name=Lindell /&gt; Just as symmetry relates to aesthetic preference and reflects an intuitive sense for how things ‘should’ appear, the overall balance of a given composition contributes to judgments of the work.

The positioning of even a single object, such as a bowl or a light fixture, in a composition contributes to preferences for that composition. When participants viewed a variety of objects, whose vertical positions on a horizontal plane were manipulated, participants preferred objects that were lower or higher in the plane of vision, corresponding to the normal placement of the image (e.g., a light bulb should be higher and a bowl lower). The center bias manifests can explain the preference for the most important or functional part of an object to occupy the center of the frame, suggesting a bias for a "rightness" of object viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sammartino|first=Jonathan|author2=Palmer, Stephen E. |title=Aesthetic issues in spatial composition: Effects of vertical position and perspective on framing single objects.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|date=1 January 2012|volume=38|issue=4|pages=865–879|doi=10.1037/a0027736}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We are also sensitive to balance in both abstract and representational works of art. When viewing variations on original artwork, such as the manipulation of the red, blue, and yellow areas of color in several [[Piet Mondrian]] paintings, design-trained and untrained participants successfully identified the balance centers of each variation. Both groups were sensitive to the distribution of color, weight, and area occupied. Expertise (see [[#Art and expertise|Art and Expertise]]) does not seem to have a large effect on perceiving balance, though only the trained participants detected the variation between the original work and manipulated versions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Locher|first=Paul|author2=Overbeeke, Kees |author3=Stappers, Pieter Jan |title=Spatial balance of color triads in the abstract art of Piet Mondrian|journal=Perception|date=1 January 2005|volume=34|issue=2|pages=169–189|doi=10.1068/p5033|pmid=15832568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both experts and novices tend to judge original abstract works as more optimally balanced than experimental variations, without necessarily identifying the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Latto|first=Richard|author2=Brain, Douglas |author3=Kelly, Brian |title=An oblique effect in aesthetics: Homage to Mondrian (1872 - 1944)|journal=Perception|date=1 January 2000|volume=29|issue=8|pages=981–987|doi=10.1068/p2352|pmid=11145089}}&lt;/ref&gt; There appears to be an intuitive sense for experts and non-experts alike that a given representational painting is the original. Participants tend to deem original artwork as original versus the manipulated works that had been both subtly and obviously altered with respect to the balance of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Locher|first=Paul J|title=An empirical investigation of the visual rightness theory of picture perception|journal=Acta Psychologica|date=1 October 2003|volume=114|issue=2|pages=147–164|doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2003.07.001|pmid=14529822}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests some innate knowledge, perhaps not influenced by artistic expertise, of the rightness of a painting in its balance. Both masters and novices are equally susceptible to shifts in balance affecting preference for paintings, which may suggest that both artists viewers have an intuitive sense of balance in art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vartanian|first=Oshin|author2=Martindale, Colin |author3=Podsiadlo, Jacob |author4=Overbay, Shane |author5= Borkum, Jonathan |title=The link between composition and balance in masterworks vs. paintings of lower artistic quality|journal=British Journal of Psychology|date=1 November 2005|volume=96|issue=4|pages=493–503|doi=10.1348/000712605X47927|pmid=16248938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art and expertise===
{{primary sources|date=December 2012}}
Psychologists have found that a person's level of expertise in art influences how they perceive, analyze, and interact with art.&lt;ref name=Silvia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silvia|first=P. J.|title=Knowledge-based assessment of expertise in the arts: exploring aesthetic fluency|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|year=2007|volume=1|issue=4|pages=247–249|doi=10.1037/1931-3896.1.4.247}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To test psychologically, scales have been designed to test experience rather than just years of expertise by testing recognition and knowledge of artists in a number of fields, fluid intelligence, and personality with the [[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]] factor inventory.&lt;ref name=Silvia /&gt;  These found that people with high art expertise were not significantly smarter, nor had a college major in the arts.&lt;ref name=Silvia /&gt;   Instead, openness to experience, one of the Big Five factors, predicted someone's expertise in art.&lt;ref name=Silvia /&gt;

====Preferences====

In one study, experienced art majors and naive students were shown pairs of popular art paintings from magazines and high-art paintings, from museums.&lt;ref name=Winston&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winston|first=W. S.|last2=Cupchik|first2= G.

Naive participants preferred popular art over high-art, while expert participants preferred high-art over popular art.&lt;ref name=Winston/&gt; They also found that naive participants rated popular art as more pleasant and warm and the high-art paintings as more unpleasant and cold, while experts showed the opposite pattern.&lt;ref name="Winston"/&gt;  Experts look to art for a challenging experience, naive participants view art more for pleasure.&lt;ref name="Winston"/&gt; Systematic preferences for viewing portraiture (left or right 3/4 profiles) have been found across media, artists, styles, gender/sex, and historical epoch.&lt;ref name=Conesa&gt;{{cite journal|title=Incidence of the Half-Left Profile Pose in Single-Subject Portraits|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|year=1995|volume=81|issue=3|pages=920–922|pmid=8668453|author1=Conesa|first1=J|last2=Brunold-Conesa|first2=C|last3=Miron|first3=M|doi=10.2466/pms.1995.81.3.920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both experiential tendencies and innate predispositions have been proposed to account for pose preferences.&lt;ref name=2Conesa-Sevilla&gt;{{cite journal|title=Preference for the half-left profile pose: Three inclusive models|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|year=1996|volume=82|issue=3|pages=1070|pmid= 8823872 |author1=Conesa|first1=J|doi=10.2466/pms.1996.82.3c.1070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies controlling variables such as sex and handedness,&lt;ref name="3Conesa-Sevilla, et. al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conesa-Sevilla-et. al.|first=J.|title=Sex and differential hemispheric activation in directional and orientation preferences|journal=Presented at the 77th meeting of the Western Psychological Association, Tacoma, Washington|year=1997|volume=|issue=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as ongoing hemispheric activation, have shown that these preferences can be studied across several construct dimensions.&lt;ref name=4Conesa-Sevilla&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conesa-Sevilla|first=J.|title=Hemispheric activation and preference for the half-left profile|journal=Presented at the Western Psychological Association, Portland, Oregon, April 2000|year=2000|volume=|issue=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To investigate if experts and non-experts experience art differently even in their eye movements, researchers used an eye tracking device to see if there are any differences in the way they look at works of art.&lt;ref name=Pihko&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pihko|first=E.|title=Experiencing art: the influence of expertise and painting abstraction level|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|year=2011|volume=5|pages=1–10|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2011.00094|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After viewing each work, participants rated their liking and emotional reactions to the works.&lt;ref name="Pihko"/&gt; Some works were presented with auditory information about that work, half of which were neutral facts and the other half were emotional statements about the work.&lt;ref name="Pihko"/&gt; They found that non-experts rated the least abstract works more preferably, while abstraction level did not matter to the experts.&lt;ref name="Pihko"/&gt; Across both groups, the eye paths showed more fixations within more abstract work, but each fixation was shorter in time than those within less abstract work .&lt;ref name="Pihko"/&gt; Expertise influences how participants thought about works, but did not influence at all how they physically viewed them.&lt;ref name="Pihko"/&gt;

In another study using eye-movement patterns to investigate how experts view art, participants were shown realistic and abstract works of art under two conditions: one asking them to free scan the works, and the other asking them to memorize them.&lt;ref name=Vogt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vogt|first=S.|author2=S. Magnussen |title=Expertise in pictorial perception: eye-movement pattern and visual memory in artists and laymen|journal=Perception|year=2007|volume=36|issue=1|pages=91–100|doi=10.1068/p5262|pmid=17357707}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants' eye movements were tracked as they either looked at the images or tried to memorize them, and their recall for the memorized images was recorded.&lt;ref name=Vogt /&gt; The researchers found no differences in the fixation frequency or time between picture types for experts and nonexperts.&lt;ref name=Vogt /&gt;  However, across sessions, the non-experts had more short fixations while free scanning the works, and fewer long fixations while trying to memorize; experts followed the opposite pattern.&lt;ref name=Vogt /&gt;  There was no significant difference in the recall of the images across groups, except experts recalled abstract images better that non-experts, and more pictorial details.&lt;ref name=Vogt /&gt; These results show that people with arts expertise view repeated images less than non-experts, and can recall more details about images they have previously seen.&lt;ref name=Vogt /&gt;

====Levels of abstraction====

Aesthetic reactions to art can be measured on a number of different criteria, like arousal, liking, emotional content, and understanding. The art can be rated on its levels of abstraction or place in time. An experiment examining how these factors combine to create aesthetic appreciation included experts and nonexperts rating their [[Valence (psychology)|emotional valence]], arousal, liking, and comprehension of abstract, modern, and classical art works.&lt;ref name=Leder&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leder|first=H.|author2=G. Gerger |author3=S. G. Dressler |author4=A. Schabmann |title=How art is appreciated|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics, Creativity, and the Arts|year=2012|volume=6|issue=1|pages=2–10|doi=10.1037/a0026396}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts demonstrated a higher degree of appreciation with higher ratings on all scales, except for arousal with classical works.&lt;ref name=Leder /&gt; Classical artworks yielded the highest comprehension ratings, with abstract art receiving the lowest values.&lt;ref name=Leder /&gt; However, emotional valence was highest for classical and modern art, while arousal was highest for abstract works.&lt;ref name=Leder /&gt; Although experts rated the works higher overall, each factor influenced the nonexperts' ratings more, creating greater flexibility in their ratings than those of the experts.&lt;ref name=Leder /&gt;

Another experiment examined the effect of color and degree of realism on participants' perception of art with differing levels of expertise. Groups of experts, relative experts, and non-experts viewed stimuli consisting of generated versions of figurative paintings varying in color and abstraction.&lt;ref name=Hekkert&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hekkert|first=P.|author2=Van Wieringen, P. C.|title=The impact of level of expertise on the evaluation of original and altered versions of post-impressionistic paintings|journal=Acta Psychologica|year=1996|volume=94|issue=2|pages=117–131|doi=10.1016/0001-6918(95)00055-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants rated the stimuli on their overall preference, abstractness, color properties, balance, and complexity.&lt;ref name="Hekkert"/&gt; Figurative pictures were preferred over abstract pictures with decreasing expertise and colored pictures were preferred over black-and-white pictures.&lt;ref name="Hekkert"/&gt; However, experts were more likely to prefer black-and-white pictures over colored ones than non-experts and relative experts.&lt;ref name="Hekkert"/&gt; This suggests that experts may view art with cognitive models, while non-experts view art looking for familiarity and pleasure.&lt;ref name="Hekkert"/&gt;

====Other factors====

An experiment studying the effect of expertise on the perception and interpretation of art had art history majors and psychology students view ten contemporary art paintings of diverse styles. Then, they grouped them into whatever labels they thought to be appropriate.&lt;ref name=Augustin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Augustin|first=M. D.|author2=Leder, H. |title=Art expertise: a study of concepts and conceptual spaces|journal=Psychology Science|year=2006|volume=48|issue=2|pages=135–156|url=http://www.pabst-publishers.de/psychology-science/2-2006/05_Augustin.pdf|format=PDF|issn=1614-9947|publisher= Pabst Science Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data were coded to classify the categorizations and compared between experts and non-experts.&lt;ref name=Augustin /&gt; Experts broke down their classifications into more groups than the non-experts and categorized by style, while the non-experts depended on personal experiences and feelings.&lt;ref name=Augustin /&gt;

This style-related processing, which leads to a mastery of the artwork, is important in viewing modern abstract art and is affected by expertise.&lt;ref name=Belke&gt;{{cite journal|last=Belke|first=B.|author2=Leder, H. |author3=Augustin, M.D. |title=Mastering style - effects of explicit style-related information, art knowledge and affective state on appreciation of abstract paintings|journal=Psychology Science|year=2006|volume=48|issue=2|pages=115–134|url=http://cognitivefluency.com/research/mastering.style.pdf|format=PDF|issn=1614-9947|publisher= Pabst Science Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants viewed and rated their liking on three sets of paintings, half of which included information about the style of the painting, such as artistic technique, stylistic features, and the materials used.&lt;ref name=Belke /&gt; The next day, participants viewed new paintings, saw a blank screen, and estimated how long they had viewed the paintings.&lt;ref name=Belke /&gt; Participants also completed questionnaires indicating interest in art, a questionnaire indicating expertise in art, and the “Positive and Negative [[Affect (psychology)|Affect]] Schedule” mood questionnaire.&lt;ref name=Belke /&gt; The effects of style-related information depended on art expertise, where non-experts liked the paintings more after receiving information about the paintings and the experts liked the paintings less after receiving style-related information.&lt;ref name=Belke /&gt; Explicit style information provoked mood changes in liking, where the high Positive Affect group liked the paintings more with information and the low Positive Affect group liked the paintings less with information.&lt;ref name=Belke /&gt; Art expertise did not, however, affect the estimations of presentation time.

===Title information===

Titles do not simply function as a means of identification, but also as guides to the pleasurable process of interpreting and understanding works of art.&lt;ref name=Russell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russell|first=Phil A.|title=Effort after meaning and the hedonic value of paintings|journal=British Journal of Psychology|date=1 February 2003|volume=94|issue=1|pages=99–110|doi=10.1348/000712603762842138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing title information about a painting does not seem to affect eye movement when looking at it or how subjects interpret its spatial organization. However, titles influence a painting’s perceived meaning.  In one study, participants were instructed to describe paintings while using flashlight pointers to indicate where they were looking. The participants repeated this task for the same set of paintings in two sessions. During the second session, some of the paintings were presented with new titles to evaluate the consistency in their descriptions. As expected, subjects did not change where their eye-gaze focused, but they did change their descriptions by making them more consistent with a given title.&lt;ref name=Franklin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franklin|first=Margery B.|author2=Becklen, Robert C. |author3=Doyle, Charlotte L. |title=The Influence of Titles on How Paintings Are Seen|journal=Leonardo|date=1 January 1993|volume=26|issue=2|pages=103|doi=10.2307/1575894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though descriptions might fluctuate, aesthetically appreciating both abstract and representative art remains stable, regardless of different title information.&lt;ref name=leder&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leder|first=Helmut|author2=Carbon, Claus-Christian |author3=Ripsas, Ai-Leen |title=Entitling art: Influence of title information on understanding and appreciation of paintings|journal=Acta Psychologica|date=1 February 2006|volume=121|issue=2|pages=176–198|doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2005.08.005|pmid=16289075}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that word/image relations can promote different modes of understanding art, but do not account for how much we like a particular piece.&lt;ref name=Franklin /&gt;

A famous example of title confusion that altered a work’s title/image relationship, and thus its ostensive meaning, is a painting titled ''[[La trahison des images]]'' (''The treachery of images''), by [[René Magritte]], that is often referred to as "This is not a pipe". It contains an image of a pipe as well as the legend "This is not a pipe," even though that was not meant to be its title. In this case, two different understandings of the artists’ intentions and the content depend on which title is chosen to go with it.&lt;ref name=Yeazell&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yeazell|first=Ruth Bernard|authorlink=Ruth Yeazell|title=This Is Not a Title|journal=The Yale Review|date=April 2011|volume=99|issue=2|pages=134–143|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9736.2011.00709.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9736.2011.00709.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, random titles, other than the original, decrease understanding ratings, but do not necessarily alter the significance of aesthetic experience.&lt;ref name=Millis&gt;{{cite journal|last=Millis|first=Keith|title=Making meaning brings pleasure: the influence of titles on aesthetic experiences|journal=Emotion|date=1 September 2001|volume=1|issue=3|pages=320–329|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.1.3.320|pmid=12934689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborative, as opposed to descriptive, titles are particularly important in helping viewers assign meaning to abstract art. Descriptive titles increase understanding of abstract art only when viewers are presented with an image for a very short period of time (less than 10 seconds). Because art can have a variety of multi-leveled meanings, titles and other additional information can add to its meaningfulness and consequently, its hedonic value.&lt;ref name=Russell /&gt;

==Applications==

Discoveries from the psychology of art can be applied to various other fields of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alfirevic | first1 = Dj | year = 2011 | title = Visual Expression in Architecture | url = http://scindeks-clanci.ceon.rs/data/pdf/0354-6055/2011/0354-60551131003A.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Arhitektura i urbanizam | volume = 31 | issue = 31| pages = 3–15 | doi=10.5937/arhurb1131003a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Markovic | first1 = S. | last2 = Dj | first2 = Alfirevic | year = 2015 | title = Basic dimensions of experience of architectural objects' expressiveness: Effect of expertise | url = https://www.academia.edu/11541805/Basic_dimensions_of_experience_of_architectural_objects_expressiveness_Effect_of_expertise | journal = Psihologija | volume = 48 | issue = 1| pages = 61–78 | doi=10.2298/psi1501061m}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The creative process of art yields a great deal of insight about the mind.  One can obtain information about work ethics, motivation, and inspiration from an artist’s work process.  These general aspects can transfer to other areas of one’s life.  Work ethic in art especially, can have a significant impact on one’s overall productivity elsewhere.  There is a potential in any kind of work that encourages the aesthetic frame of mind.  Moreover, art defies any definite boundaries.  The same applies to any such work that is aesthetically experienced.&lt;ref name="B &amp; S"/&gt;

==Criticisms==
The psychology of art can be a criticized field for numerous reasons.  Art is not considered a science, so research can be scrutinized for its accuracy and relativity.  There is also a great deal of criticism about art research as psychology because it can be considered subjective rather than objective.  It embodies the artist’s emotions in an observable manner, and the audience interprets the artwork in multiple ways.  The aims of an artist differ dramatically from the aims of a scientist.  The scientist means to propose one outcome to a problem, whereas an artist means to give multiple interpretations of an object.  The inspirations of an artist are fueled through his/her experiences, perceptions, and perspectives of the world art movements such as Expressionism are known for the artist’s release of emotions, tension, pressure, and inner spiritual forces that are transcribed to external conditions.  Art comes from within oneself, and it is expressed in the external world for the entertainment of others.  Everyone can appreciate a piece of artwork because it speaks to each individual in unique ways—therein lies the criticism of subjectivity.&lt;ref name="R &amp; T"&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Saeid|last1=Rahmatabadi|first2=Reza|last2=Toushmalani|title=Physical Order and Disorder in Expressionist Architecture Style|url=http://ajbasweb.com/old/ajbas/2011/September-2011/406-409.pdf|journal=Australian Journal of Basic and Applied Sciences|volume=5|issue=9|pp=406–409|year=2011|issn=1991-8178|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160613234028/http://ajbasweb.com/old/ajbas/2011/September-2011/406-409.pdf|archivedate=13 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the aesthetic experience of art is heavily criticized because it cannot be scientifically determined.  It is completely subjective, and it relies on an individual’s bias.  It cannot be fundamentally measured in tangible forms.  In contrast, aesthetic experiences can be deemed "self-motivating" and "self-closing".&lt;ref name="B &amp; S"/&gt;

'''Puritan New England Funerary Art''' reached its peak during the 16th and 17th centuries after the arrival of English Puritans in the Colonies. These iconic images such as death’s head and the willow and the urn illustrate the simplistic artistry that the period strived towards. Reasoning for this is because after the Reformation, the English Puritans wished  for greater purity and distance from the Catholic Church.

==Cultural background==

The primary objective was to extol the virtues of paradise and the transformation of the flesh to spirit.  There was a distinct shift that emphasized the inappropriateness of scriptural art.  The narrative style of England had changed to one of emblems. Puritans were adamantly against attributing human form to spiritual beings such as God, angels, or spirits, so iconography such as death was preferable and did not violate the second commandment.

Our modern view of death and burial recoil from the Puritan’s use of coffins, skulls, shovels, barred teeth, and empty eyes that were typically seen on gravestones. To the Puritans, these were traditional symbols brought from England. Death was to be depicted as the transformation from the flesh to the spiritual realm without the gritty naturalistic detail.
Early New England stones have emblems derived from English morality and the baroque style. Later gravestones are simpler and depict the stages between death and new life, where the soul moves from the body.

==Iconic Images==

===Winged Death Head===
Though seemingly frightening, the symbol of death in Puritan New England was much closer to depicting the symbolic voyage from life to death. Death is first a winged head, but with careful analysis of gravestones, there is a distinct transformation to the glorification of the soul. Another common depiction of death is a full skeletal body, typically clad with a scythe or the moon and sun in his hands.

This picture of death was meant to instill the terrors of death. In the corners of a typical stone with this depiction are angels at the top and bats of the underworld at the bottom.  The scythe is most often mid swing among flowers symbolizes the flowering of a man’s life cut off by death and time.

A winged death head can be seen to the right and symbolizes the triumph of death.  A typical image of death has serrated teeth, “hole eyes,” a thin elongated jaw, and a slash for a mouth. This image has been commonly used since Elizabethan times.

Within fifty years the depiction of death changes. The death’s head has become crowned, the lower jaw eliminated, and serrations of teeth appear on the upper row, a characteristic carving of the mid-18th century.  Particularly, the eyes become more animated—almond shaped and with pupils—seeming more soul-like than deathlike. Extra imagery such as foliage, grapes and vines, and hearts suggest new life through sacraments and Resurrection.
This transition cannot be clearly, or easily, seen through the gravestones. The changes are very minute and gradual leaving some stones at a disturbing image in between an empty skull and a lively soul.

===Willow and Urn===
Typically seen as a European symbol, the tree of life has been significant since Sumerian times. The Puritans took this symbol and created their own versions. The tree can be interpreted as life in celestial paradise or as the human life; however, during the 18th century the two were used interchangeably by the New Englanders. In the 19th century, the weeping willow made a distinctive entrance.

The willow suggests a Greek revival in architecture and a shift in emphasis away from the fate of the soul of the deceased, but instead the mourning of those left behind. The urn is a container to hold ashes used by Imperial Roman. Usage of these icons was part of a larger style toward sentimentality in mourning art. This redirected the emotional output of those left behind. Instead of fearing their loved ones damnation, this depiction is much more peaceful. For example, "Here lies the body of" is replaced by "In memory of." There was also a transition from slate to marble.
The evolution of style of death's head, and urn and willow design is to be found in almost every cemetery in New England. The emblems of death shifted as the societal interpretation of life and hereafter changed from terror to peace.

'''Qalaat Tannour''' (also known as '''Qalaat et Tannoûr''') is a [[Shepherd Neolithic]] archaeological site located halfway between [[Britel]] and [[Haour Taala]], {{convert|12|km|mi}} southwest of [[Baalbek]] in the [[Baalbek District]] of the [[Beqaa Governorate]] in [[Lebanon]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"&gt;{{cite book|author1=L.

The surface site was discovered by  M. Besançon in 1966 on a hill of exposed limestone rocks. It was the furthest south of all of the Shepherd Neolithic sites catalogued at the time. [[Flint]] tools found at the location were generally in a brown or grey, some showing a white [[patina]]. Blade types were typically short but also included thin and backed varieties, steep-scrapers and cores. The material was stored with the [[Saint Joseph University]], [[Museum of Lebanese Prehistory]].&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"/&gt;

Several [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[tomb]]s were also noted at the site.&lt;ref name="CopelandWescombe1966"/&gt;

[[File:St John Evangelist-Francesco Furni-MBA Lyon 1987-3-IMG 0334.jpg|thumb|300px]]
'''''Saint John the Evangelist''''' is a 1635–1636 painting by [[Francesco Furini]], which has been in the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]] since 1987.

It was inspired by the work of [[Caravaggio]] and was commissioned by the painter's patron marquess Vitelli. The facial features show it was based on the same model as the artist's ''Apollo the Archer'' ([[Columbia University]]) and for various female allegorical figures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="845">[[Wilhelm Furtwängler]]'s '''Symphony No. 1 in B minor''', written between 1938 and 1941, is based on an earlier piece he wrote, a Largo in B minor from 1908. To this he added three more movements for a 4-movement work:

# Largo
# Scherzo. Allegro
# Adagio
# Moderato assai

==Discography==

Unlike his later two symphonies, Furtwängler himself never recorded this one. The work lasts about 80 minutes, so [[George Alexander Albrecht]]'s interpretation on Arte Nova Classics requires two discs, while [[Alfred Walter]] conducting the Slovak State Philharmonic Orchestra, Košice only needs one Marco Polo CD.

[[File:The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb, and a detail, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|550px|right|''The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb'' (and detail, lower) 30.5 cm × 200 cm. Öffentliche Kunstsammlung, [[Basel]]]] 

'''''The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb''''' is an oil and [[tempera]] on limewood painting created by the German artist and [[printmaker]] [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] between 1520–22. The work shows a life-size, [[grotesque]] depiction of the stretched and unnaturally thin body of [[Jesus Christ]] lying in his tomb. Holbein shows the dead Son of God after he has suffered the fate of an ordinary human.

==Description==
The painting is especially notable for its dramatic dimensions (30.5&amp;nbsp;cm x 200&amp;nbsp;cm),&lt;ref name="tate"&gt;Onfray, Michel. "[http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue8/messagesfromamaster.htm The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb (1521)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513021450/https://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue8/messagesfromamaster.htm |date=2009-05-13 }}". [[Tate Etc.]], 2006. Retrieved on May 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and the fact that Christ's face, hands and feet, as well as the wounds in his torso, are depicted as realistic dead flesh in the early stages of [[decomposition|putrefaction]]. His body is shown as long and emaciated while eyes and mouth are left open.&lt;ref name="Bat88"&gt;Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 88&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb Detail.jpg|thumb|Detail]]

Christ is shown with three visible wounds; on his hand, side and feet. Discussing the artist's use of unflinching realism, Bätschmann and Griener noted that Christ's raised and extended middle finger appears to "reach towards the beholder", while his strands of hair "look as if they are breaking through the surface of the painting".&lt;ref name="Bat88" /&gt; Above the body, angels holding instruments of [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion]] bear an inscription in brush on paper inscribed with the Latin words "&lt;small&gt;[[INRI|IESVS·NAZARENVS·REX·IVDÆORVM]]" (''Jesus [[Nazarene (title)|of Nazareth]], King of the Jews''&lt;/small&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/h/holbein/hans_y/1525/03deadch.html The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb]".

[[File:Matthias Grünewald - The Crucifixion - WGA10723.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Centerpiece of [[Matthias Grünewald]]'s ''[[Isenheim Altarpiece]]'']]

==Background==
In common with many artists of the early [[Protestant Reformation]], Holbein was fascinated with the macabre. His father, [[Hans Holbein the Elder]], took him to see [[Matthias Grünewald]]'s  [[Isenheim Altarpiece|altarpiece]] in [[Isenheim]], a city in which the elder also received a number of commissions from the local hospice.&lt;ref name="Bat88" /&gt; In common with the religious traditions of the 1520s the work was intended to evoke [[piety]] and follows the intentions of Grünewald, who in his altarpiece set out to instill feelings of both guilt and empathy in the viewer.&lt;ref name="Bat89" /&gt; 

[[File:Mathis Gothart Grünewald 028.jpg|500px|thumb|[[Matthias Grünewald]], ''Lamentation and Entombment of Christ''; ([[predella]] of the [[Isenheim Altarpiece]]), 1512–15, Musee d'Unterlinden, [[Colmar]].]]

It is unknown for what purpose the painting was created. Various suggestions have been offered, including as a [[predella]] for an [[altarpiece]], a free-standing work, or an ornament for a [[sepulchre]].&lt;ref name="tate" /&gt; In 1999, the art historians Oskar Bätschmann and Pascal Griener raised the possibility that the panel was intended to form part of a [[Funerary art|Holy Tomb]], perhaps as a lid to be laid over a sepulchre.&lt;ref name="Bat89" /&gt; It is known that Holbein used a body fished out of the Rhine as a model for the work.

==Commentary==
The panel has attracted fascination and praise since it was created. The Russian author [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] was captivated by the work. In 1867, his wife had to drag him away from the panel lest its grip on him induce an epileptic fit.&lt;ref name="Bat89"&gt;Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 89&lt;/ref&gt; Dostoevsky saw in Holbein an impulse similar to one of his own main literary preoccupations: the pious desire to confront Christian faith with everything that negated it, in this case the laws of nature and the stark reality of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frank|first1=Joseph|title=Dostoevsky A Writer in His Time|date=2010|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=550}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1869 novel ''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]]'', the character [[Prince Myshkin]], having viewed a copy of the painting in the home of Rogozhin, declares that it has the power to make the viewer lose his faith.&lt;ref&gt;Meyers, 136–147&lt;/ref&gt; The character of Ippolit Terentyev, an articulate exponent of atheism and nihilism who is himself near death, engages in a long philosophical discussion of the painting, claiming that it demonstrates the victory of 'blind nature' over everything, including even the most perfect and beautiful of beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dostoevsky|first1=Fyodor|title=The Idiot|date=2004|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=475-477}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Literary theorist [[Julia Kristeva]] included a psychoanalysis of the painting in her book ''Black Sun: Depression and Melancholia''.  "Does Holbein forsake us, as Christ, for an instant, had imagined himself forsaken?," she asks. "Or does he, on the contrary, invite us to change the Christly tomb into a living tomb, to participate in the painted death and thus include it in our own life, in order to live with it and make it live?"&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, Julia (1989). p 113&lt;/ref&gt;  

The effect of the open eyes and mouth has been described by the art critic [[Michel Onfray]] as giving the impression that "the viewer sees Christ seeing: he might also perceive what death has in store, because he's staring at the heavens, while his soul is probably there already. No-one has taken the trouble to close his mouth and his eyes. Or else Holbein wants to tell us that, even in death, Christ still looks and speaks."&lt;ref name="tate" /&gt;

'''''The Hiroshima Panels''''' (原爆の図, ''Genbaku no zu'') are a series of fifteen painted folding panels by the collaborative husband and wife artists Maruki Iri and Maruki Toshi completed over a span of thirty-two years (1950–1982).  The ''Panels'' depict the consequences of the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], as well as other nuclear disasters of the 20th century. Each panel stands 1.8 metres x 7.2 metres. 

The paintings depict people wrenched by the violence and chaos of the atomic bombing; some wandering aimlessly, their bodies charred, while others are still being consumed by atomic fire.  Dying lovers embrace and mothers cradling their dead children.  Each painting portrays the inhumanity, brutality, and hopelessness of war, and the cruelty of bombing [[civilians]]. The people depicted in the paintings are not only [[Japanese people|Japanese]] citizens but also [[Koreans|Korean]] residents and [[United States|American]] [[POWs]] who suffered or died in the atomic bombings as well.  

The Marukis tried to represent all those affected so as to make their cause an international one and above that one of universal importance to all human beings.  The use of traditional Japanese black and white ink drawings, [[sumi-e]], contrasted with the red of atomic fire produce an effect that is strikingly [[anti-war]] and [[anti-nuclear]].

The panels also depict the accident of the ''[[Daigo Fukuryu Maru]]'' on the [[Bikini Atoll]] in 1954 which the Marukis believed showed the threat of a nuclear bomb even during peace time.

'''The 15 ''Hiroshima Panels''''':

*''I Ghosts'' (幽霊, ''Yūrei'', 1950)
*''II Fire'' (火, ''Hi'', 1950)
*''III Water'' (水, ''Mizu'', 1950)
*''IV Rainbow'' (虹, ''Niji'', 1951)
*''V Boys and Girls'' (少年少女, ''Shōnen shōjo'', 1951)
*''VI Atomic Desert'' (原子野, ''Genshi-no'', 1952)
*''VII Bamboo Thicket'' (竹やぶ, ''Takeyabu'', 1954)
*''VIII Rescue'' (救出, ''Kyūshutsu'', 1954)
*''IX Yaizu'' (焼津, ''Yaizu'', 1955)
*''X Petition'' (暑名, ''Shomei'', 1955)
*''XI Mother and Child'' (母子像, ''Boshi-zō'', 1959)
*''XII Floating Lanterns'' (とうろう流し, ''''Tōrō nagashi'', 1969)
*''XIII Death of American Prisoners of War'' (米兵捕虜の死, ''Beihei-horyo no shi'', 1971)
*''XIV Crows'' (からす, ''Karasu'', 1972)
*''XV Nagasaki'' (長崎, ''Nagasaki'', 1982)

Short prose-like poems written by the artists to further explain the subject of their visual work also accompany each painting.

In 1967, the Maruki Gallery for the Hiroshima Panels, was established in [[Higashimatsuyama|Higashi-Matsuyama]], [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]], [[Japan]], as a permanent home for ''The Hiroshima Panels''.  The fifteenth panel, ''Nagasaki'', is on permanent display at the Nagasaki International Cultural Hall.  Also available for view at the Maruki Gallery are the Marukis' further collaborative paintings on [[Auschwitz]], the [[Nanking massacre]], the [[battle of Okinawa]], [[Minamata]], and their summary collaborative painting entitled [[Hell]].

It was for these monumental works, along with their continued peace education efforts that the Marukis received a nomination for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1995.

''The Hiroshima Panels'' have also been the subject of the 1987 [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominated documentary ''[[Hellfire: A Journey from Hiroshima]]''.

The Japanese composer [[Masao Ohki]] composed in 1953 his 5th Symphony. The first six panels that have been painted until then were turned into six movements.

The '''''Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew'''''  is a painting by [[Jusepe de Ribera|Lo Spagnoletto]] conserved at the [[National Art Museum of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Guide of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. MNAC, 2004. {{ISBN|84-8043-136-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The painting illustrates [[martyrdom]] and physical torment. The almost naked apostle Bartholomew looks at us helplessly, while a sadistic drunken executioner delightedly flays him. On the ground, a classical sculpture, which has been identified as the god Baldach, and in the background two priests, their heads covered, are witnesses to the torture. The painting follows the text by [[Jacobus de Voragine]] in the 'Golden Legend', which is the Christian version of the fable of the satyr [[Marsyas]], who suffered the same punishment as [[Saint Bartholomew]]. This is a work demonstrating the excellent art of ''Lo Spagnoletto''. Before entering the MNAC it belonged to the illustrator [[Alexandre de Riquer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130115174258/http://art.mnac.cat/fitxatecnica.html;jsessionid=47ebcd8e6d370c6926ffc938f57f3dd871295ffedac166160908977bcfde952b?inventoryNumber=024162-000 The artwork at MNAC's Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Quick and the Dead''''' is a 1995 American [[western film]] directed by [[Sam Raimi]], and starring [[Sharon Stone]], [[Gene Hackman]], [[Russell Crowe]] and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]. The screenplay was written by [[Simon Moore (writer)|Simon Moore]] but includes contributions from [[Joss Whedon]].&lt;ref name=Whedon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/2013/03/06/sam-raimi-explains-why-spider-man-4-didnt-happen/|title=Sam Raimi Explains Why Spider-Man 4 Didn’t Happen|publisher=Spinoff Online |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story focuses on "The Lady" (Stone), a [[gunfighter]] who rides into the [[American frontier|frontier]] town of Redemption, controlled by John Herod (Hackman). The Lady joins a deadly dueling competition in an attempt to exact revenge for her father's death.

Simon Moore's script was purchased by [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] in May 1993, and actress Sharon Stone signed on as both star and co-producer. Development was [[wikt:Fast track|fast tracked]] after director Sam Raimi's hiring, and [[principal photography]] began in [[Old Tucson Studios]] in [[Arizona]] on November 21, 1993. The film was distributed by [[TriStar Pictures]] and was released in the US on February 10, 1995, to a dismal [[box office]] performance, receiving lukewarm reviews from critics.

This was Russell Crowe's American film debut and was [[Woody Strode]]'s final performance (the film is dedicated to him), as well as the last theatrical release of [[Roberts Blossom]] who died in 2011. The phrase "[[The quick and the dead (idiom)|the quick and the dead]]" is from the [[Second Epistle to Timothy]] (2 Timothy 4:1) in various Bible versions, including the [[King James Bible]], describing the final judgment. The plot of this film bears no resemblance to that of the [[The Quick and the Dead (1987 film)|1987 film of the same name]], which was based on a western novel by [[Louis L'Amour]].

==Plot==
In 1881, a female gunslinger known only as The Lady arrives in the Old West town of Redemption, where she enters a [[bracket (tournament)|single elimination]] quick-draw contest held by Redemption's ruthless mayor and former outlaw, John Herod. She encounters the Blind Shoeshine Boy and a repulsive escaped convict named Scars, whose proposition she harshly rebuffs. At a sign-up meeting in the town saloon that night, the rules are explained: any contestant may challenge any other, no challenge can be refused, every contestant must fight once per day, and a fight continues until one contestant either yields or dies. While there she meets Cort, a former Herod henchman turned preacher whom Herod has captured and forced to enter the contest. The Lady saves Cort's life by shooting through the rope with which Herod's men try to hang him, then drunkenly spends the night with "The Kid", a brash young man who runs a gun store and hopes to impress Herod. Believing Herod to be his father, The Kid hopes to earn his respect by entering and winning the tournament.

In the first round of duels, The Kid defeats a Swedish quick-draw champion while Herod kills a braggart named Ace Hanlon, who had taken credit for some of Herod's own accomplishments. The Lady defeats Dog Kelly, an enemy she had previously left shackled to a wagon. Since Cort has no money, Herod buys him a cheap, rusty gun and declares that he can only have one bullet at a time so that he cannot shoot his way out of town. Even though Cort has renounced violence, he draws on his exceptional skill as a gunfighter and wins his first-round duel.

Before the second round begins, Herod meets with Clay Cantrell, a professional gunfighter hired by the townspeople to kill him. Before they duel, Herod changes the rules and proclaims that all contests are now to the death. After killing Cantrell, Herod angrily addresses the townspeople and informs them that he will continue to raise his taxes on them until they understand that he is in charge of everything. During a rainstorm that evening The Lady faces off with Eugene Dred after he rapes the saloon owner's young daughter. She shoots him in the genitals but spares his life and returns to the bar, but Dred ambushes her and she is ultimately forced to kill him.  

The next day, Cort is slated to fight Spotted Horse, a Native American who claims he "cannot be killed by a bullet". The Lady, still upset over killing Dred the night before, saddles up and rides out of town before Cort's fight. Cort narrowly beats Spotted Horse after having to beg for a second bullet. The Lady is found at a nearby cemetery by Doc Wallace, who tells her that he recognizes her and knows why she is there. During flashbacks, it is revealed that the Lady's real name is Ellen, and her father used to be the Marshal in Redemption until Herod invaded, killed all the deputies and had him strung up. Herod gave Ellen a pistol and three shots to try and break the rope her father was hanging from, but she accidentally killed him. Doc Wallace tells her that Herod's men dug up her father's body, burned it, and smashed his tombstone. He hands Ellen her father's old badge and begs her to come back and help rid the town of Herod, as she and Cort are now Redemption's only hope. 

Ellen rides back to town and directly challenges Herod but is sickened to hear that he has already accepted a fight against The Kid. Ellen and Cort are the only other fighters left and are ordered by Herod to face off, threatened with execution if neither of them draws on the other. The Kid turns down Herod's suggestion to withdraw from the contest; during their duel, Herod kills The Kid while suffering a wound to the neck. When Cort and Ellen face off, Cort begs her to kill him, then draws and fires on her. Doc Wallace declares Ellen dead; Cort angrily demands to fight Herod immediately, but settles for dawn of the next day. Ratsy, one of Herod's henchmen, beats Cort severely that night and breaks his right hand.

The next morning, Herod angrily dismisses Ratsy from his service upon seeing Cort's injury, then kills him with a rifle as he tries to flee. He offers to fight Cort left-handed, but tells his henchmen to kill Cort if he wins. At the moment Herod draws, several buildings explode, including Herod's house and the clock tower. Ellen emerges from the smoke and flames, having faked her death with the help of Cort, Doc Wallace, and a bottle of red ink procured from the Blind Boy and having used The Kid's stash of dynamite. Cort kills Herod's men, and Ellen faces off against Herod, revealing her identity by throwing her father's badge at his feet. Herod wounds Ellen, but she shoots him through the chest and finishes him off with a bullet to the eye. Tossing the badge to Cort, she says, "The law's come back to town," then saddles up and rides away.

==Production==

===Development===
Writer [[Simon Moore (writer)|Simon Moore]] finished his [[spec script]] for ''The Quick and the Dead'' in late 1992, writing it as a [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the [[Spaghetti Western]]s of [[Sergio Leone]], particularly the ''[[Dollars Trilogy]]'' starring [[Clint Eastwood]]. The writer decided the lead character should be a female. "When you introduce women into that kind of world, something very interesting happens and you have an interesting dynamic straight away," Moore commented.&lt;ref name=first/&gt; The names of the lead villain ([[Herod the Great|Herod]]) and the town (Redemption) were intentional allusions to the Bible.&lt;ref name=first/&gt; Moore considered directing his own script as an [[independent film]] and shooting ''The Quick and the Dead'' on a $3–4 million budget in either Spain or Italy.&lt;ref name=first/&gt;

[[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] purchased Moore's script in May 1993 and approached [[Sharon Stone]] to star in the lead role in July 1993.&lt;ref name=first&gt;Muir, pp. 171-179&lt;/ref&gt; Because Stone also signed on as co-producer, she had approval over the choice of director. [[Sam Raimi]] was hired to direct because Stone was impressed with his work on ''[[Army of Darkness]]'' (1992). The actress told the producers that if Raimi did not direct the film, she would not star in it. Although she had mixed emotions on Raimi's previous work, she believed that the director still had yet to showcase his talents, feeling that ''The Quick and the Dead'' would be a perfect opportunity to "stretch the limits of his technical and creative ability."&lt;ref name=Comp&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Bill Warren (film historian and critic)|Bill Warren]] | title = The Evil Dead Companion | month = | year = 2000 | publisher = [[Titan Books]] | location = London | chapter = Blood Still in the Veins | pages = 162–179 | ISBN = 0-312-27501-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore was also enthusiastic over Raimi's hiring, based on his previous work with the [[The Evil Dead (franchise)|''Evil Dead'' film series]].&lt;ref name=first/&gt;

When Sony began [[wikt:Fast track|fast tracking]] development ''The Quick and the Dead,'' the studio commissioned a series of rewrites from Moore. The writer was eventually dismissed and replaced with [[John Sayles]], who, according to Moore, took Sony's orders of "making more of an [[American Old West]] film."&lt;ref name=second/&gt; Moore was rehired with filming to begin in three weeks because Sayles' script was approaching a 2.5 hour runtime. When rewriting the [[shooting script]], Moore simply omitted Sayles' work without Sony noticing. A week before shooting, Sony considered the script good so that Moore described the rewrites "a completely fucking pointless exercise."&lt;ref name=second/&gt;

===Filming===
[[Russell Crowe]] originally auditioned for a different role in the film before Sharon Stone asked that the actor try for the lead male role. "When I saw ''[[Romper Stomper]]'' (1992), I thought Russell was not only charismatic, attractive and talented but also fearless," Stone reasoned. "And I find fearlessness very attractive. I was convinced I wouldn't scare him."&lt;ref name=new/&gt; Raimi found Crowe to be "bold and challenging. He reminds me of what we imagine the American cowboy to have been like."&lt;ref name=new&gt;{{cite news | author = Jamie Diamond | title = Straight Out of Australia, to L.A. | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 1995-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On working with Raimi, Crowe later described the director as "sort of like the fourth [[The Three Stooges|Stooge]]."&lt;ref name=first/&gt;

[[Image:Sam Raimi by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|145px|left|Director Sam Raimi]]
Sony Pictures was dubious over Stone's choice of Crowe because he was not a famous actor in the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=first/&gt; To cast [[Gene Hackman]] in the role of Herod, [[TriStar Pictures]] changed the shooting location from [[Durango]], Mexico to [[Tucson, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Army Archerd]] | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862241 | title = Douglas wows 'Greedy' cast, crew | date = 1993-08-16 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Rockwell]] auditioned for The Kid, a role which ended up going to [[Leonardo DiCaprio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Rebecca Murray; Fred Topel | url = http://movies.about.com/library/weekly/aaconfessionsintb.htm | title = Sam Rockwell Talks About ''Confessions of a Dangerous Mind'' | work = [[About.com]] | accessdate = 2009-03-07 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090227215636/http://movies.about.com/library/weekly/aaconfessionsintb.htm | archivedate = 2009-02-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sony was also dubious over DiCaprio's casting. As a result, Stone decided to pay for the actor's salary herself.&lt;ref name=first/&gt;

Filming was originally set to begin in October 1993,&lt;ref name=film/&gt; but was delayed because Crowe was busy on another film in Australia.&lt;ref name=first/&gt; [[Principal photography]] for ''The Quick and the Dead'' lasted from November 21, 1993 to February 27, 1994.&lt;ref name=film&gt;{{cite news | author = Army Archerd | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862363 | title = Lemmon enjoying fruitful outings | date = 1993-10-13 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Army Archerd | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862435 | title = Friends stunned, saddened by Shore's death | date = 1994-02-25 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locations included [[Old Tucson Studios]] in Arizona&lt;ref name=first/&gt; and Mescal, 40 miles southeast of Tucson.&lt;ref name=second/&gt; Production was briefly halted at times over weather problems.&lt;ref name=third/&gt; [[Thell Reed (Shooter)|Thell Reed]], who was hired as the gun coach and [[weapons master]],&lt;ref name=first/&gt; worked with the cast through over three months of training.&lt;ref name=second/&gt; To age Cort's [[Colt 1851 Navy Revolver]] and the other guns used, Reed experimented with simple measures. "I took them out by my swimming pool and dipped them in chlorine water to let them rust," he explained. "They looked rusty and old, but were brand new guns."&lt;ref name=third/&gt; Such detail, including the [[nickel]] plating and ivory handles on Ellen's [[Colt Single Action Army|Colt Peacemakers]], was accurate to the time period.&lt;ref name=third&gt;Muir, pp.190-197&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of Redemption was designed by [[Patrizia von Brandenstein]], known for her work on ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'' (1984) and ''[[The Untouchables (film)|The Untouchables]]'' (1987).&lt;ref name=second/&gt; Raimi's first choice as the [[visual effects supervisor]] was William Mesa, his collaborator on ''[[Darkman]]'' (1991) and ''[[Army of Darkness]]'' (1993). Instead, Sony chose [[Framestore|The Computer Film Company]] to create the VFX sequences.&lt;ref name=first/&gt; [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|Pick-up]] scenes took place through November - December 1994. This included an extended duel between Sharon Stone and Gene Hackman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Army Archerd | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117862606 | title = H'w'd pumped for sequel to 'Gump' | date = 1994-12-20 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone had a love scene removed from the final cut of ''The Quick and the Dead'' before the film's release in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Ck9WAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vOsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6765,2873726&amp;dq=quick-and-the-dead+stone&amp;hl=en |title=Winnie Mandela Caught in New Flap|publisher=Eugene Register-Guard|accessdate=2011-02-19|date= 1995-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The actress/co-producer thought the scene did not fit in with the picture's established reality.&lt;ref name=second/&gt; It was restored for the home cinema releases of the film.

===Soundtrack===
The original motion picture soundtrack for ''The Quick and the Dead'', was released by the [[Varèse Sarabande]] music label on February 14, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000014WE |title=The Quick and the Dead Soundtrack |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score for the film was composed and conducted by [[Alan Silvestri]] and mixed by [[Dennis S.

===Box office===
''The Quick and the Dead'' was released in the U.S. on February 10, 1995 in 2,158 theaters, earning $6,515,861 in its opening weekend. The film eventually grossed $18,636,537 in at the US box office&lt;ref name="BoxOfficeMojo" /&gt; and was declared to be a [[box office bomb]]. Writer Simon Moore noted that the film performed modestly in Europe.&lt;ref name="second" /&gt;

''The Quick and the Dead''' faced competition at the box office from ''[[Billy Madison]]'', ''[[The Brady Bunch Movie]]'', ''[[Just Cause (film)|Just Cause]]'' and ''[[Heavyweights]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.the-numbers.com/charts/weekly/1995/19950217.php | title = The Top Movies, Weekend of February 17, 1995 | work = The Numbers | accessdate = 2009-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director Sam Raimi later blamed himself and his visual style for the film's failure. "I was very confused after I made that movie. For a number of years I thought, I'm like a dinosaur. I couldn't change with the material."&lt;ref name=second/&gt; [[TriStar Pictures]] also showed ''The Quick and the Dead'' as an "out-of-competition" film at the May [[1995 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3381/year/1995.html |title=Festival de Cannes: The Quick and the Dead |accessdate=2009-09-08|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Stone was nominated for the [[Saturn Award for Best Actress]], but lost to [[Angela Bassett]] in ''[[Strange Days (film)|Strange Days]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saturnawards.org/past.html |title=Past Saturn Awards |work=Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy &amp; Horror Films |accessdate=2009-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207072429/http://www.saturnawards.org/past.html |archivedate=2008-02-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[novelization]] written by [[Jack Curtis (writer)|Jack Curtis]] was published by [[HarperCollins]] in September 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.amazon.com/dp/0006496512 | title = The Quick and the Dead (Paperback) | work = [[Amazon.com]] | accessdate = 2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[DVD region code|Region 1 DVD]] release came in September 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.amazon.com/dp/0767817710/ | title = The Quick and the Dead (1995) | work = [[Amazon.com]] | accessdate = 2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Stone's presence nicely underscores the genre-bending tactics of Raimi, the [[cult film]]maker now doing his best to reinvent the [[B movie]] in a spirit of self-referential glee."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Janet Maslin]] | title=The Quick and the Dead | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=1995-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' criticized the film for being overtly [[cliché]], but praised Raimi's direction and [[Dante Spinotti]]'s [[cinematographer|cinematography]].&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite news | author = [[Roger Ebert]] | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19950210/REVIEWS/502100302/1023 | title = The Quick and the Dead | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = 1995-02-10 | accessdate = 2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic and Raimi biographer [[Bill Warren (film historian and critic)|Bill Warren]] wrote that the film "is a very conscious (though not self-conscious) attempt to recreate some of the themes, style and appeal of [[Sergio Leone]]'s majestically operatic [[Spaghetti Western]]s of the 1960s, especially the [[Man with No Name]] trilogy that starred [[Clint Eastwood]]. It's brisker, more romantic and somehow more American than Leone's movies."&lt;ref name=Comp/&gt;

| style="text-align: left;" |"The cinematographer, Dante Spinotti (''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1992 film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'') makes the material look terrific. The lowering skies around the isolated town make it look ripe for vengeance of biblical proportions, and there are quiet satirical touches, as when a man stands in a saloon door and his shadow seems about 6 miles long."

[[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] of the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' observed that "Raimi tries to do a Sergio Leone, and though ''The Quick and the Dead'' is highly enjoyable in spots, it doesn't come across as very convincing, perhaps because nothing can turn Sharon Stone into [[Charles Bronson]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] | title=The Quick and the Dead | url=http://onfilm.chicagoreader.com/movies/capsules/12414_QUICK_AND_THE_DEAD | work=[[Chicago Reader]] | accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Travers]] of [[Rolling Stone]] felt that "''The Quick and the Dead'' plays like a crazed compilation of highlights from famous westerns. Raimi finds the right look but misses the heartbeat. You leave the film dazed instead of dazzled, as if an expert marksman had drawn his gun only to shoot himself in the foot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Peter Travers]] | title=The Quick and the Dead | url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/the-quick-and-the-dead-19950101 | work=[[Rolling Stone]] | date=1995-03-09 | accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Tall Man''''' is a half-hour American [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television series]] about Sheriff [[Pat Garrett]] and the gunfighter [[Billy the Kid]] that aired seventy-five episodes on [[NBC]] from 1960 to 1962, filmed by [[Revue Productions]]. It was also &lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinanews.com/tp/hd2011/2012/09-21/U399P4T426D134544F16470DT20120921103210.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; theatrically released and dubbed in [[North Korea]] in the 1960s.

The series is set in the late 1870s and early 1880s, and also depicts other figures of the period, such as [[John Tunstall]] and [[Lew Wallace]].

==Synopsis==
[[File:Pat Garrett2.jpg|left|thumb|125px|The real [[Pat Garrett]]]]
''The Tall Man'' stars 6'3" [[Barry Sullivan (actor)|Barry Sullivan]] as Sheriff [[Pat Garrett]], and [[Clu Gulager]] as [[Billy the Kid]].    Gulager was 32 in 1960, 11 years older than Billy the Kid was at the time of his death in 1881 at the age of 21.  The highly fictionalized series provides a more humane image of the Kid than has history itself.  In real life Garrett eventually shot Billy dead in a night-time ambush at a farmhouse in [[Fort Sumner, New Mexico|Fort Sumner]], [[New Mexico]], but no concluding episode depicting the grim conclusion was filmed.  Set in and about [[Lincoln, New Mexico]], the series opens with a view of the extremely long shadow cast by Sullivan on a Western street, hence the name "the tall man".

In the premiere episode, "Garrett and the Kid" (September 10, 1960), Garrett arrives in Lincoln, depicted in the series as a gold-mining [[boomtown]], as the new deputy sheriff, only to learn that a crooked saloon owner, Paul Mason ([[Robert Middleton]]), dominates the community, including the marshal, Dave Leggert ([[Denver Pyle]]). When he sees his power threatened, Mason tries to hire Billy to kill Garrett, unaware that the two were then on friendly terms. [[Vaughn Taylor (actor)|Vaughn Taylor]] is cast in this episode as Judge Riley, and [[King Donovan]] appears as a Mason henchman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717585/|title=Garrett and the Kid|publisher=[[Internet Movie Data Base]]|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marianna Hill]] was cast in several episodes as one of Billy's girlfriends, Rita. In one episode, [[Robert Lansing (actor)|Robert Lansing]] played the frontier dentist, gambler, and gunfighter [[Doc Holliday|John H. "Doc" Holliday]].

==Selected episodes==

[[Andy Clyde]] was cast in five episodes as Pa McBeam; [[Judy Nugent]] plays McBean's daughter, June. Different actress were cast as the other daughter, May.

Hannah is lured to Lincoln through a fraudulent letter written by the McBeam daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717626/|title="The Reluctant Bridegroom", February 18, 1961|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In "Substitute Sheriff" (January 6, 1962), the McBeam daughters enlist their father as an acting sheriff in a scheme to thwart the seizure of their property for right-of-way by the railroad.

In "The Reversed Blade" (February 4, 1961), [[Murray Matheson]] portrays Billy's employer, John Tundall, though the name of the historical person is [[John Tunstall]]. Tundall grows indignant when the con-man Ben Webster ([[John Archer (actor)|John Archer]]), who stole his wife and $10,000 eight years earlier, arrives in Lincoln. [[Jeanne Cooper]] plays Tundall's former wife, now Mrs. Elmira Webster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717627/|title="The Reversed Blade", February 4, 1961|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=February 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Tunstall died at twenty-four, but Matheson was forty-nine when he assumed the role as Billy's employer.

Two episodes focus on visits to Lincoln by [[governor of New Mexico|Governor]] [[Lew Wallace]] of the [[New Mexico Territory]].

In "Death or Taxes" (May 27, 1961), Garrett rides into a railroad [[company town]] that abuses its workers, runs illegal gambling halls, and refuses to pay its taxes. Character actor [[Will Wright (actor)|Will Wright]] plays Mayor Hackett in this episode, which features [[James Seay]] as Holman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0717579/|title="Death or Taxes", May 27, 1961|publisher=Internet Movie Data Base|accessdate=February 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "The Runaway Groom" (April 28, 1962), the Tugwell Brothers seek the husband of their sister, Sally ([[Roberta Shore]]), who deserted his wife right after the marriage a year earlier.

Tingatinga is one of the most widely represented forms of tourist-oriented paintings in Tanzania, [[Kenya]] and neighboring countries. The genre is named after its founder, Tanzanian painter [[Edward Said Tingatinga]].

Tingatinga is traditionally made on [[masonite]], using several layers of bicycle paint, which makes for a brilliant and highly saturated colors. Many elements of the style are related to requirements of the tourist-oriented market; for example, the paintings are usually small so they can be easily transported, and subjects are intended to appeal to the Europeans and Americans (e.g., the [[Big Five Game|big five]] and other wild fauna). In this sense, Tingatinga paintings can be considered a form of "[[airport painting]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-star.co.ke/news/article-112811/exploring-tingatinga-art-movement-tanzania Exploring the Tingatinga Art Movement in Tanzania]&lt;/ref&gt; The drawings themselves can be described as both [[naive art|naïve]] and [[caricature|caricatural]], and [[humor]] and [[sarcasm]] are often explicit.

==History==
Edward Tingatinga began painting around 1968 in [[Oyster Bay, Tanzania|Tanzania]] (Dar es Salaam).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tingatinga.org/tingatinga_art.html |title=Tinga Tinga art |publisher=Tingatinga.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He employed low cost materials such as [[masonite]] and [[bicycle paint]] and attracted the attention of tourists for their colorful, both [[naive art|naïve]] and [[surrealism|surrealistic]] style. When Tingatinga died in 1972, his style was so popular that it had started a wide movement of imitators and followers, sometimes informally referred to as the "Tingatinga school".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africancontemporary.com/the%20tingatinga%20school.htm The tingatinga school of painting]. This is an informal term (i.e., those who paint after Tingatinga's example) and not to be confused with the Tingatinga Arts Cooperative Society, which is a specific organization, although sometimes also referred to as a "school".  {{cite web |url=http://www.africancontemporary.com/the%20tingatinga%20school.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917035235/http://www.africancontemporary.com/the%20tingatinga%20school.htm |archivedate=17 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first generation of artists from the Tingatinga school basically reproduced the works of the school's founder. In the 1990s new trends emerged within the Tingatinga style, in response to the transformations that the Tanzanian society was undergoing after independence. New subjects related to the new urban and multi-ethnic society of Dar es Salaam (e.g., crowded and busy streets and squares) were introduced, together with occasional technical novelties (such as the use of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]]). One of the most well known second-generation Tingatinga painters is Edward Tingatinga's brother-in-law, [[Simon Mpata]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://africancontemporary.com/Edward%20Saidi%20Tingatinga%20first%20students.htm Tingatinga first students]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507131843/http://africancontemporary.com/Edward%20Saidi%20Tingatinga%20first%20students.htm |date=7 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his short artistic life, Tingatinga left only a relatively small number of paintings, which are sought-after by collectors. Today it is known that fakes were produced from all famous Tingatinga paintings like ''The lion'', ''Peacock on the Baobab Tree'', ''Antelope'', ''Leopard'', ''Buffalo'', or ''Monkey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alexdrummerafrica.blog.com |title=Are Tingatinga fakes a problem today? |publisher=Alexdrummerafrica.blog.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314042953/http://alexdrummerafrica.blog.com/ |archivedate=14 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
[[File:wall painting ngapa1.JPG|thumb|Wall paintings in [[Ngapa, Mozambique|Ngapa]], the village of E.S.Tingatinga's father]]
[[File:wall painting ngapa3.JPG|thumb|Wall paintings in Ngapa depict animals in a [[naive art|naïve style]] that might resemble Tingatinga art]]

It is controversial whether Tingatinga's style is completely original or a derivative of traditional forms of East Africa. In his seminal paper ''Tingatinga and His Followers'', [[Sweden|Swedish]] critic Berit Sahlström claimed that Tingatinga was of [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] origin and thus suggested that his style might have connections with modern Mozambique. The claim that Tingatinga was of Mozambican descent is nevertheless rejected by most scholars and by the Tingatinga Society. Art trader Yves Goscinny suggested that Edward Tingatinga might have been influenced by [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese]] paintings that were sold in [[Dar es Salaam]] at his times.&lt;ref&gt;"Art in Tanzania 2010"&lt;/ref&gt; The source of this claim could be some articles by Merit Teisen, where she also claims that Tingatinga decorated two house walls for payment before he started painting on masonite boards.

The claim by Teisen about Tingatinga decorating house walls might also be interpreted as a clue of another origin of Tingatinga's paintings, namely the traditional [[hut (dwelling)|hut]] wall decorations of [[Makua people|Makua]] and [[Makonde people]]. These paintings were first witnessed by [[Karl Heule]] in 1906 and described in his book ''Negerleben in Deutsch-Ost Afrika''.&lt;ref&gt;K. Weule (1908), ''Negerleben in Deutsch-Ost Afrika'', Leipzig.&lt;/ref&gt; Also [[ethnology|ethnologist]] [[Jesper Kirknaes]] and Japanese painting curator [[Kenji Shiraishi]], as well as modern travellers, have seen and documented these paintings in several locations of southern Tanzania, including [[Ngapa, Mozambique|Ngapa]], a village where many relatives of Tingatinga's father still live today.

Jesper Kirknaes also documented those painting being done in Dar es Salaam by Makua and Makonde migrants. Shiraishi is one of the scholars who most firmly supported the theory that Tingatinga's art is connected to traditional Makua wall paintings. Among other considerations, Shiraishi observed that it is unlikely that a style emerged and spread so quickly over most East Africa without any connection to traditional art. He claimed that his studies provided evidence for this claim.&lt;ref&gt;Kenji Shiraishi, ''Commentary to Tingatinga II''; article: ''Tinga TingaContemporary African Art and Mural''; ''Tingatinga: Afurikan poppu-ato no sekai'' / Kenji Shiraishi and Fumiko Yamamoto. Tokyo: Kodansha, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Hanne Thorup interviewed Tingatinga student Omari Amonde, who confirmed that Tingatinga used to paint on hut walls as a young boy (around 12 years old).&lt;ref&gt;Hanne Thorup and Chitra Sundaram (2010), ''Tingatinga, Kitsch or Art'', p. 22; article: ''Off the walls to Hard Board and Canvas; What inspired Tingatinga?''&lt;/ref&gt;

Further elaborating on the Makua painting hypothesis, Shiraishi also suggested a connection between hut walls painting and traditional [[rock art|rock paintings]], an art form that in Africa has continued past [[stone age]] to at least the 19th century. Based on this connection, Shiraishi concludes that Tingatinga art might be seen as the "longest artist trend ever".&lt;ref&gt;Kenji Shirashi, ''Lilanga's Cosmos'', Africa Hoy, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Tingatinga Cooperative Society==
After Tingatinga's death, his direct 6 followers Ajaba Abdallah Mtalia, Adeusi Mandu, January Linda, Casper Tedo, [[Simon Mpata]], and Omari Amonde &lt;ref&gt;Mwasanga, National Arts Council, Mture Publishers, Tingatinga, p 30&lt;/ref&gt; tried to organize themselves. Relatives of Tingatinga also joined this group, which would be later called the "Tingatinga (or Tinga Tinga) Partnership". Not all of Tingatinga followers agreed to be in the partnership; some created a new group at Slipway.&lt;ref&gt;Abdellahamani Hasani&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the Tingatinga Partnership constituted itself into a society, renamed to '''Tingatinga Arts Cooperative Society''' (TACS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tingatinga.org/tingatinga_cooperative.html |title=Tingatinga Co-operative Society |publisher=Tingatinga.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the TACS is usually recognized as the most authoritative representative of the Tingatinga heritage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SomaliPress.com |url=http://www.somalipress.com/guides/culture/tanzania-tingatinga-arts-achievement.html |title=Tingatinga Arts Achievement |publisher=Somalipress.com |date=2009-11-24 |accessdate=2013-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; only a small fraction of Tingatinga artists are directly linked to this society.

The Tingatinga Arts Cooperative Society launched their own website on May 2018: [Http://Www.tingatingaArt.com www.tingatingaArt.com]

==Tingatinga and George Lilanga==

Although the internationally acclaimed Tanzanian artist [[George Lilanga]] was not a student of the Tingatinga school, nor a member of the Tingatinga Society, he's known to have frequented Tingatinga artists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Lilanga| first = George| title = Colors of Africa| year = 2007| isbn = 978-88-89298-32-9| page = 136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some influence of Tingatinga is evident in his work, for what concerns painting (an art form that Lilanga approached in 1974).&lt;ref&gt;''George Lilanga'', Kamphausen&lt;/ref&gt; This influence has been recognized by Lilanga himself in an interview with Kenji Shiraishi, specifically in reference to the use of [[enamel paint]] and square [[hardboard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;See K. Shiraishi, ''Lilanga's Cosmos, Africa Hoy'', p. 7. The book reports Lilanga's words as follow: ''It was entirely my own idea to incorporate this style. Nobody suggest I do it. In the Tingatinga style, I use enamel paint on hardboard. This board is excellent for achieving vivid color."&lt;/ref&gt; Besides using materials and techniques originally adopted by Tingatinga painters, Lilanga's art resembles Tingatinga also in its use of vibrant colors&lt;ref&gt;Enrico Masceloni, ''Catalogue Raisonne, George Lilanga'', p. XII&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] style, that shares the same [[horror vacui]] of Tingatinga art. It has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Thorup| first1 = Tine| last2 = Sam| first2 = Cuong| title = Tingatinga Kitch Or Quality Bicycle Enamel on Board &amp; Canvas| year = 2011| isbn = 978-87-992635-2-3| page = 68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that Lilanga (who was originally a sculptor) actually learned to paint from Tingatinga painters such as [[Noel Kapanda]] and later [[Mchimbi Halfani]], who collaborated with him.&lt;ref&gt;See also the [http://www.lilanga.org Lilanga.org] and [http://www.makonde-carvings.info Makonde Carvings] websites&lt;/ref&gt; The collaboration between Lilanga and Kapanda lasted several years.&lt;ref&gt;K. Shiraishi, ''Tingatinga and Lilanga'', The Museum of Art, Kochi, Japan 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trafalgar Square''' ({{IPAc-en|t|r|ə|ˈ|f|æ|l|ɡ|ər}} {{respell|trə|FAL|gər}}) is a [[public square]] in the [[City of Westminster]], [[Central London]], built around the area formerly known as [[Charing Cross]]. Its name commemorates the [[Battle of Trafalgar]], a [[Royal Navy|British naval]] victory in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] with France and Spain that took place on 21 October 1805 off the coast of [[Cape Trafalgar]].

The site of Trafalgar Square had been a significant landmark since the 13th century and originally contained the [[Royal Mews|King's Mews]]. After [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] moved the mews to [[Buckingham Palace]], the area was redeveloped by [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]], but progress was slow after his death, and the square did not open until 1844. The {{convert|169|ft|adj=on}} [[Nelson's Column]] at its centre is guarded by four lion statues. A number of commemorative statues and sculptures occupy the square, but the [[Fourth Plinth]], left empty since 1840, has been host to contemporary art since 1999.

The square has been used for community gatherings and political [[demonstration (people)|demonstrations]], including [[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]] in 1887, the culmination of the first [[Aldermaston March]], anti-war protests, and campaigns against [[climate change]]. A [[Christmas tree]] has been donated to the square by Norway since 1947 and is erected for twelve days before and after Christmas Day. The square is a centre of annual celebrations on [[New Year's Eve]]. It was well known for its [[feral pigeon]]s until their removals in the early 21st century.

Building work on the south side of the square in the late 1950s revealed deposits from the last [[interglacial]].

The site of Trafalgar Square has been a significant location since the 13th century. During [[Edward I of England|Edward&amp;nbsp;I]]'s reign, the area was the site of the [[King's Mews]], running north from the original [[Charing Cross]], where the [[Strand, London|Strand]] from [[City of London|the City]] met [[Whitehall]] coming north from [[Westminster]].{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=934}} From the reign of [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] to that of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], the mews was at the western end of the Strand. The name "Royal Mews" comes from the practice of keeping [[hawk]]s here for [[moulting]]; "mew" is an old word for this. After a fire in 1534, the mews were rebuilt as stables, and remained here until [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] moved them to [[Buckingham Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/visit/royalmews/about/the-history-of-the-royal-mews|title=The History of the Royal Mews|publisher=Royal Collection Trust|accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clearance and development ===
After 1732, the King's Mews were divided into the Great Mews and the smaller Green Mews to the north by the Crown Stables, a large block, built to the designs of [[William Kent]]. Its site is occupied by the National Gallery.{{sfn|Mace|1976|p=29}} 

In 1826 the Commissioners of H.M. Woods, Forests and Land Revenues instructed [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] to draw up plans for clearing a large area south of Kent's stable block, and as far east as St Martin's Lane. His plans left open the whole area of what became Trafalgar Square, except for a block in the centre, which he reserved for a new building for the Royal Academy.&lt;ref name=survey /&gt; The plans included the demolition and redevelopment of buildings between St Martin's Lane and the Strand and the construction of a road (now called Duncannon Street) across the churchyard of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]].{{sfn|Mace|1976|p=37}} The Charing Cross Act was passed in 1826 and clearance started soon after.&lt;ref name=survey /&gt; Nash died soon after construction started, impeding its progress. The square was to be named for [[William IV of the United Kingdom|William IV]] commemorating his ascent to the throne in 1830.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=176}} Around 1835, it was decided that the square would be named after the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] as suggested by architect [[George Ledwell Taylor]], commemorating [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Nelson]]'s victory over the French and Spanish in 1805 during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=934}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9TBOcU1WXEcC&amp;pg=PA209&amp;dq=%22trafalgar+square|title=Wanderlust: Based on the true-life journals of Sydney Taylor|first=Marc|last=Cardinal|publisher=AuthorHouse|p=209|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4490-7907-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the clearance, development progressed slowly. The National Gallery was built on the north side between 1832 and 1838 to a design by [[William Wilkins (architect)|William Wilkins]],&lt;ref name=survey&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=68408&amp;strquery=wilkins%20trafalgar%20square%20national |title=Trafalgar Square and the National Gallery |author=G.

Trafalgar Square was opened to the public on 1 May 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cunningham|first1=Peter|title=Handbook of London Past and Present|date=1849|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=lxv|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yKoxAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PR65&amp;dq|chapter=London Occurrences 1837–1843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nelson's Column ===
[[File:Lion-nelson-column-trafalgar-london-uk.jpg|thumb|left|The lions at [[Nelson's Column]] were not finished until nearly 30 years after the square opened.| alt=The lions at Nelson's Column]]
[[Nelson's Column]] was planned independently of Barry's work. In 1838 a Nelson Memorial Committee had approached the government proposing that a monument to the victor of Trafalgar, funded by public subscription, should be erected in the square. A competition was held and won by the architect [[William Railton]], who proposed a {{convert|218|ft|3|in|m}} [[Corinthian order|Corinthinan]] column topped by a statue of Nelson and guarded by four sculpted lions. The design was approved, but received widespread objections from the public. Construction went ahead beginning in 1840 but with the height reduced to {{convert|145|ft|3|in|m}}.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=177}} The column was completed and the statue raised in November 1843.{{sfn|Mace|1976|page= 90}}

The last of the bronze reliefs on the column's pedestals was not completed until May 1854, and the four lions, although part of the original design, were only added in 1867.{{sfn|Mace|1976|pp=107–8}} Each lion weighs seven tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Bow Bells - A Magazine of General Literature|year=1867 |publisher=John Dicks|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=5M0aAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=Landseer+seven+tons&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo04T8-YPTAhWM1ywKHSVhD00Q6AEIJjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Landseer%20seven%20tons&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hoarding remained around the base of Nelson's Column for some years and some of its upper scaffolding remained in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Opening of Trafalgar Square |newspaper=The Times |date=31 July 1839 |page=6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Landseer, the sculptor, had asked for a lion that had died at the [[London Zoo]] to be brought to his studio. He took so long to complete sketches that its corpse began to [[decomposition|decompose]] and some parts had to be improvised. The statues have paws that resemble cats more than lions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/uk/london/11268400/Londons-secret-sights-16-more-odd-attractions-you-never-knew-were-there.html?frame=3155177|title=The faulty lions of Trafalgar Square|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry was unhappy about Nelson's Column being placed in the square. In July 1840, when its foundations had been laid, he told a parliamentary select committee that "it would in my opinion be desirable that the area should be wholly free from all insulated objects of art".&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{Citation |title=Report from the Select Committee on Trafalgar Square together with the Minutes of Evidence|year=1840 |publisher=Printed by the House of Commons |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xFcAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940 the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] developed secret plans to transfer Nelson's Column to [[Berlin]]{{efn|Hitler had specifically requested that all of [[Rembrandt]]'s paintings in the National Gallery be seized as part of the move, as he particularly admired the artist's work.{{sfn|Longmate|2012|p=137}}}} after an expected [[Operation Sea Lion|German invasion]], as related by [[Norman Longmate]] in ''If Britain Had Fallen'' (1972).{{sfn|Longmate|2012|p=137}}

The square has been Grade I listed on the [[Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England|Register of Historic Parks and Gardens]] since 1996.&lt;ref name=NHLEGarden&gt;{{NHLE|num=1001362|desc=Trafalgar Square|access-date=11 July 2017|mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Redevelopment ===
A major 18-month redevelopment of the square led by [[Atkins (company)|W.S. Atkins]] with [[Foster and Partners]] as sub-consultants was completed in 2003. The work involved closing the eastbound road along the north side and diverting traffic around the other three sides of the square, demolishing the central section of the northern retaining wall and inserting a wide set of steps to the pedestrianised terrace in front of the National Gallery. The construction includes two lifts for disabled access, public toilets and a café. Access between the square and the gallery had been by two crossings at the northeast and northwest corners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trafalgar Square redevelopment|publisher=Foster+Partners|url=http://www.fosterandpartners.com/projects/trafalgar-square-redevelopment/|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=935}}

Barry's scheme provided two plinths for sculptures on the north side of the square.&lt;ref name=gn /&gt; A bronze [[equestrian statue]] of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] by Sir [[Francis Chantrey]], originally intended to be placed on top of the [[Marble Arch]],&lt;ref name=survey /&gt; was installed on the eastern plinth in 1844, while the other remained empty until late in the 20th century.&lt;ref name=gn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov-news.org/gov/uk/news/270_suggestions_for_trafalgar_squares_vacant/40121.html|title=Suggestions for Trafalgar Square's Vacant Plinth|publisher=Government News|date=27 December 1999|accessdate=27 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208134336/http://www.gov-news.org/gov/uk/news/270_suggestions_for_trafalgar_squares_vacant/40121.html|archive-date=8 December 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two other statues on plinths, both installed during the 19th century: General Sir [[Charles James Napier]] by [[George Cannon Adams]] in the south-west corner in 1855, and Major-General Sir [[Henry Havelock]] by [[William Behnes]] in the south-east in 1861.&lt;ref name=survey /&gt; In 2000, the [[Mayor of London]], [[Ken Livingstone]], suggested replacing the statues with figures more familiar to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Paul Kelso|title=Mayor attacks generals in battle of Trafalgar Square|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk_news/story/0,3604,385413,00.html|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 October 2000|accessdate=25 May 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fourth plinth ====
{{Main|Fourth plinth, Trafalgar Square}}
In the 21st century, the empty plinth in the north-west corner of the square, the "Fourth Plinth", has been used to show specially commissioned temporary artworks. The scheme was initiated by the [[Royal Society of Arts]] and continued by the Fourth Plinth Commission, appointed by the Mayor of London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/arts-and-culture/art-and-design/fourth-plinth|title=Fourth Plinth|publisher=Greater London Council|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other sculptures ===
There are three busts of admirals against the north wall of the square. Those of [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Lord Jellicoe]] (by Sir [[Charles Wheeler (sculptor)|Charles Wheeler]]) and [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Lord Beatty]] (by [[William McMillan (sculptor)|William MacMillan]]) were installed in 1948 in conjunction with the square's fountains, which also commemorate them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Discovering London Statues and Monuments |last=Baker |first=Margatet |year=2008 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=McMillan,_William_(1887–1977),_sculptor|title=McMillan, William (1887–1977)|publisher=Your Archives, [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third, of the [[World War II|Second World War]] [[First Sea Lord]] [[Andrew Cunningham, 1st Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope|Admiral Cunningham]] (by [[Franta Belsky]]) was unveiled alongside them on {{Nowrap|2 April}} 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=|first=|title=Bust of Viscount Cunningham of Hyndhope by Franta Belsky|url=http://yourarchives.nationalarchives.gov.uk/index.php?title=Bust_of_Viscount_Cunningham_of_Hyndhope_by_Franta_Belsky|volume=|pages=|publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)#"Your Archives"|Your Archives, The National Archives]]|accessdate=27 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the south side of Trafalgar Square, on the site of the original Charing Cross, is a bronze [[Equestrian statue of Charles I, Charing Cross|equestrian statue of Charles I]] by [[Hubert Le Sueur]]. It was cast in 1633, and placed in its present position in 1678.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Gorton (writer)|John Gorton]]: ''A Topographical Dictionary of Great Britain and Ireland'', 1833, p. 687&lt;/ref&gt;

The two statues on the lawn in front of the National Gallery are the [[Statue of James II, Trafalgar Square|statue of James II]] by [[Grinling Gibbons]] to the west of the portico, and of one [[George Washington]], a [[George Washington (Houdon)|replica of a work]] by [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], to the east.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=935}} The latter was a gift from the Commonwealth of [[Virginia]], installed in 1921.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=875}}

Two statues erected in the 19th century have since been removed. One of [[Edward Jenner]], pioneer of the [[smallpox vaccine]], was set up in the south-west corner of the square in 1858, next to that of Napier. Sculpted by [[William Calder Marshall]], it showed Jenner sitting in a chair in a relaxed pose, and was inaugurated at a ceremony presided over by [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. It was moved to [[Kensington Gardens]] in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1858 |title=The Jenner Monument |journal=Dublin Hospital Gazette |volume=5 |page=176 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45228 |title=Kensington Gardens |author=Edward Walford |publisher=Institute of Historical Research |year=1878 |work=Old and New London: Volume 5 |accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other, of General [[Charles George Gordon]] by [[Hamo Thornycroft]], was erected on an 18-foot high pedestal between the fountains in 1888. It was removed in 1943 and re-sited on the [[Victoria Embankment]] ten years later.{{sfn|Mace|1976|pp=125–126}}

== Fountains ==
[[File:Trafalgar square fountain, June 7 2014.JPG|thumb|Fountain at Trafalgar Square, 2014|alt=Fountain at Trafalgar Square, 2014]]
In 1841, following suggestions from the local paving board, Barry agreed that two fountains should be installed to counteract the effects of reflected heat and glare from the asphalt surface. The First Commissioner of Woods and Forests welcomed the plan because the fountains reduced the open space available for public gatherings and reduced the risk of riotous assembly.{{sfn|Mace|1976|p=87}} The fountains were fed from two wells, one in front of the National Gallery and one behind it connected by a tunnel. Water was pumped to the fountains by a steam engine housed in a building behind the gallery.&lt;ref name=survey /&gt;

In the late-1930s it was decided to replace the pump and the centrepieces of the fountains. The new centrepieces, designed by Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]], were memorials to [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|Lord Jellicoe]] and [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|Lord Beatty]], although busts of the admirals, initially intended to be placed in the fountain surrounds were placed against the northern retaining wall when the project was completed after the Second World War.{{sfn|Mace|1976|pp=130–1}} The fountains cost almost £50,000. The old ones were presented to the Canadian government and are now located in [[Ottawa]]'s [[Confederation Park]] and [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]]'s [[Wascana Centre]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 20090529"&gt;{{citation|title=Trafalgar Square fountain spurts to new heights|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/29/trafalgar-square-fountains-reopen|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 May 2009 | location=London | first=Maev | last=Kennedy | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GardenFoundation"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trafalgar Square fountains|url=http://www.garden-fountain.co.uk/trafalgar.asp|year=2003|accessdate=16 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A programme of restoration was completed by {{Nowrap|May 2009}}. The pump system was replaced with one capable of sending an {{convert|80|ft|m|adj=on}} jet of water into the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2009/may/29/trafalgar-square-fountains-reopen|title=Trafalgar Square fountain spurts to new heights|first=Maev|last=Kennedy|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 May 2009|accessdate=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[light-emitting diode|LED]] lighting system that can project different combinations of colours on to the fountains was installed to reduce the cost of lighting maintenance and to coincide with the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="Guardian 20090529" /&gt;

[[File:People feeding pigeons in Trafalgar Square c.1993.jpg|thumb|People sitting on lions and feeding pigeons in the square|alt=Pigeons flocking to London's Trafalgar Square]]
The square was once famous for [[feral pigeon]]s and feeding them was a popular activity. Pigeons began flocking to the square before construction was completed and feed sellers became well known in the Victorian era.{{sfn|Moore|2003|p=181}} The desirability of the birds' presence was contentious: their droppings disfigured the stonework and the flock, estimated at its peak to be 35,000, was considered a [[Rock pigeon#Human health|health hazard]].&lt;ref name=pidgeons /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=House Guests, House Pests: A Natural History of Animals in the Home|first=Richard|last=Jones|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2015|p=85|isbn=978-1-4729-0624-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stall seller, Bernie Rayner, infamously sold bird seed to tourists at inflated prices.&lt;ref name=ipidgeon&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/the-pigeons-have-gone-but-visitors-are-flocking-to-trafalgar-square-2041675.html|title=The pigeons have gone, but visitors are flocking to Trafalgar Square|first=Andy|last=McSmith|newspaper=The Independent|date=23 October 2011|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Events ==

=== New Year ===
For many years, revellers celebrating the [[New Year]] have gathered in the square despite a lack of celebrations being arranged. The lack of official events was partly because the authorities were concerned that encouraging more partygoers would cause overcrowding. Since 2003, a firework display centred on the [[London Eye]] and [[South Bank]] of the [[River Thames|Thames]] has been provided as an alternative. Since 2014, New Year celebrations have been organised by the Greater London Authority in conjunction with the charity [[Unicef]], who began ticketing the event to control crowd numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/get-involved/events/london-nye-2015-fireworks|title=London New Year's Eve with Unicef.|work=Greater London Authority|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Christmas ===
{{See also|Trafalgar Square Christmas tree}}
[[File:Trafalgar Square Christmas tree8.jpg|thumb|upright|The Trafalgar Square Christmas tree in 2008|alt=The Trafalgar Square Christmas tree]]

A [[Christmas]] ceremony has been held in the square every year since 1947.&lt;ref name=bbctree /&gt; A [[Norway spruce]] (or sometimes a [[fir]]) is presented by Norway's capital city, [[Oslo]] as London's [[Christmas tree]], a token of gratitude for Britain's support during World War&amp;nbsp;II.&lt;ref name=bbctree /&gt; (Besides war-time support, Norway's [[Olav V of Norway|Prince Olav]] and the country's government lived in exile in London throughout the war.&lt;ref name=bbctree /&gt;)

The Christmas tree is decorated with lights that are switched on at a seasonal ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/events/tree-lighting#?tab=map&amp;map=SignificantWeather&amp;zoom=8&amp;lon=-0.12&amp;lat=51.51&amp;fcTime=1362477600|title=Trafalgar Square tree lighting ceremony|publisher=Met Office|accessdate=25 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually held twelve days before Christmas Day.

The tree is selected by the Head Forester from Oslo's [[municipal forest]] and shipped, across the [[North Sea]] to the [[Port of Felixstowe]], then by road to Trafalgar Square. The first tree was {{convert|48|ft|m}} tall, but more recently has been around {{convert|75|ft|m}}. In 1987, protesters chained themselves to the tree.&lt;ref name=bbctree /&gt; In 1990, a man sawed into the tree with a chainsaw a few hours before a New Year's Eve party was scheduled to take place. He was arrested and the tree was repaired by [[Arborist|tree surgeons]] who removed gouged sections from the trunk while the tree was suspended from a crane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-12-31/news/mn-5771_1_tree-square-trafalgar|title=Man Takes Chain Saw to Trafalgar Square Tree, but Tannenbaum Stands|author=Associated Press|date=31 December 1990|accessdate=22 December 2015|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political demonstrations ===
[[File:Rally in Trafalgar Square.jpg|thumb|left|A demonstration in Trafalgar Square|alt=A demonstration in Trafalgar Square]]
The square has become a social and political focus for visitors and Londoners, developing over its history from "an [[esplanade]] peopled with figures of national heroes, into the country's foremost ''place politique''", as historian Rodney Mace has written. Since its construction, it has been a venue for political demonstrations.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=935}} The great [[Chartism|Chartist]] rally in 1848, a campaign for social reform by the working class began in the square.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=935}} A ban on political rallies remained in effect until the 1880s, when the emerging [[Labour movement]], particularly the [[Social Democratic Federation]], began holding protests. On {{Nowrap|8 February}} 1886 (also known as "Black Monday"), protesters rallied against unemployment leading to a riot in [[Pall Mall, London|Pall Mall]]. A larger riot (''"[[Bloody Sunday (1887)|Bloody Sunday]]"'') occurred in the square on {{Nowrap|13 November}} 1887.{{sfn|Crick|1994|p=47}}

The [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]'s first [[Aldermaston Marches|Aldermaston March]], protesting against the [[Atomic Weapons Establishment]] (AWE), began in the square in 1958.{{sfn|Weinreb et al.|2008|p=935}} One of the first significant demonstrations of the modern era was held in the square on {{Nowrap|19 September}} 1961 by the [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)|Committee of 100]], which included the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]].
