      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11616">'''Agroecosystem analysis''' is a thorough analysis of an [[agricultural]] environment which considers aspects from [[ecology]], [[sociology]], [[economics]], and [[politics]] with equal weight. There are many aspects to consider; however, it is literally impossible to account for all of them. This is one of the issues when trying to conduct an analysis of an agricultural environment. In the past, an agroecosystem analysis approach might be used to determine the [[sustainability]] of an agricultural system. It has become apparent, however, that the "sustainability" of the system depends heavily on the definition of sustainability chosen by the observer. Therefore, agroecosystem analysis is used to bring the richness of the true complexity of agricultural systems to an analysis to identify reconfigurations of the system (or ''holon'') that will best suit individual situations.

[[Agroecosystem]] analysis is a tool of the multidisciplinary subject known as [[Agroecology]]. Agroecology and agroecosystem analysis are not the same as [[sustainable agriculture]], though the use of agroecosystem analysis may help a farming system ensure its viability. Agroecosystem analysis is not a new practice, [[agriculturalists]] and [[farmers]] have been doing it since societies switched from hunting and gathering ([[hunter-gatherer]]) for food to settling in one area. Every time a person involved in agriculture evaluates their situation to identify methods to make the system function in a way that better suits their interests, they are performing an agroecosystem analysis.

== Agroecosystem analysis and sustainable agriculture differ ==

It is difficult to discuss these differences without the aid of an example. Consider the case of a conventional (see [[conventional agriculture]]) apple farmer. This farmer may choose to change his farm to conform to the standards of [[USDA]] approved [[organic agriculture]] because he felt motivated by social or moral norms or the potential of increased profits or a host of other reasons. This farmer evaluated his situation and reconfigured it to try to improve it. Some might look at this situation and conclude that the apple farmer chose organic apple production because it is more sustainable for the environment. But, what if a few years later the farmer finds that he is struggling to make a profit and decides to go back to conventional agriculture?  The farmer performed another agroecosystem analysis and arrived at a reconfiguration that some might see as unsustainable. This example illustrates how agroecosystem analysis is not required to lead a more environmentally sustainable form of agriculture. Agroecosystem analysis might produce a reconfiguration that is more economically sustainable or socially sustainable or politically sustainable for a farmer (or other actor). By definition, however, agroecosystem analysis is not required to produce an environmentally sustainable configuration for an agricultural system.

== Approach to analysis ==

William L. Bland, from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], developed the idea of a farm as a [[Holon (philosophy)]] This term, ''holon'', was originally introduced by [[Arthur Koestler]] in 1966, in which he referred to a ''holon'' as an entity in which it is a part by itself, a ''holon'', while contributing to a larger entity, which is also a ''holon''.&lt;ref&gt;* Koestler, Arthur, 1967. ''The Ghost in the Machine''. London: Hutchinson. 1990 reprint edition, Penguin Group. {{ISBN|0-14-019192-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bland develops this for an agricultural environment or [[farm]] as, "The farm holon is both the whole in which smaller holons exists, and a part of larger entities, themselves holons." This idea was expanded upon by Bland and Michael M. Bell [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in their 2007 article "A holon approach to agroecology,"&lt;ref&gt;*Bland, W.L. and Bell, M.M., (2007) A holon approach to agroecology ''International Journal of Agricultural Sustainability'' 5(4), 280-294. [http://www.drs.wisc.edu/documents/articles/bell/bland-bell-2007.pdf abstract available here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426051309/http://www.drs.wisc.edu/documents/articles/bell/bland-bell-2007.pdf |date=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because it is difficult to account for boundary and change when using a [[systems thinking]] approach. One major difference between Koestler's holon and the holon idea developed for agroecosystem analysis is that the latter can only be defined as a holon if it has [[intentionality]].

The farm itself is a holon and within the [[farm]] holon, other holons exist. For example, a [[Livestock|farm animal]], the farm [[family]], and a [[farmworker]] can all be considered holons within the farm. Additionally, the farm is considered a holon which is inpart connected to other holons such as the [[county]] in which the farm resides, the [[bank]] from which the [[farmer]] borrowed money, or the [[grain elevator]] where the farmer can sell goods. Things like the [[tractor]] or the [[barn]] are not holons because they lack [[intentionality]].

When conducting an agroecosystem analysis, the analyst should approach the farm as the farm itself and the "[[ecology of contexts]]" in which the farm and the farmer function. A "context" is anything that might influence functioning of the farm and cause it to change. According to Bland and Bell, examples of contexts include, "family, farm business, genetic heart disease, and spiritual beliefs." These examples illustrate the breadth of contexts that could influence why farmers do what they do. Bland concluded his model of a [[farm]] as a ''holon'' by stating, "A farm is not [[sustainable]] (disintegrates) when it cannot find an overall configuration that is simultaneously viable in all contexts."

==Questions to consider==

There is no right or wrong way to evaluate an agroecosystem. It is important to identify all actors in a holon before beginning the analysis. When an analyst accepts the task of analyzing the agroecosystem, first and foremost, it must be approached as to incorporate all elements involved and should derive questions that should be answered. Questions such as:

*What defining factors (holons and contexts) determine the present configuration of the agroecosystem?
*How does one quantify the sustainability of the farm holon (economic, social, political, ecological and/or other)?
*How does the farmer or farm family perceive an agroecosystem?
*What is the farmer doing now, and how do those practices or actions affect the viability of the agroecosystem?
*Can the farmer maintain his livelihood continuing with current practices?
*What does the farmer value and where do those values come from?
*Will the farmer consider alternative farm configurations?

These are the types of questions an analyst could consider. There are no preset questions to ask, and usually more questions are derived than answered. However, the most important task an analysts can do, is to start the analysis with an open mind and under no presumptions about what is and is not sustainable for the farm holon.

== Analysis types ==

J. Visser of [[Dordt College]] uses a diagram, "Wealth Creation Wheel"&lt;ref&gt;*[http://cari.unl.edu/Presentations/wealthwheel.pdf Wealth Creation Wheel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907235848/http://cari.unl.edu/Presentations/wealthwheel.pdf |date=September 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to emphasize and account for the parameters of developing a thorough analysis. His diagram is more emphasized on [[economics]]; however, it is a useful tool to reference when starting to analyze an agroecoystem. His interest is to create a functioning wheel which will ''roll'' when all parameters are met equally. If one parameter is not functioning in context with the other parameters, then the wheel will be out of balance and ineffective, thus unsustainable. When referring to an [[agroecosystem]], if one parameter is out of balance, this could lead to an unproductive cropping season and loss of income and/or livelihood.

National regulations are coordinated under international standards, maintained by bodies such as the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO). The maintenance tasks, personnel and inspections are all tightly regulated and staff must be licensed for the tasks they carry out.

==Market==
[[File:Luftwaffe GR-4 Tornado undergoing maintenance during Cooperative Cope Thunder 2004.JPEG|thumb|A [[Panavia Tornado]] undergoing maintenance]]

The [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul]] (MRO) Market was US$135.1 Billion in 2015, three quarters of the $180.3 B aircraft production market. Of this, 60% is for [[civil aviation]] : [[air transport]] 48%, business and [[general aviation]] 9%, [[rotorcraft]] 3% ; and [[military aviation]] is 40% : fixed wing 27% and rotary 13%. Of the $64.3 Billion air transport MRO market, 40% is for engines, 22% for components, 17% for line, 14% for airframe and 7% for modifications. Its is projected to grow at 4.1% per annum till 2025 to $96B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.aeromontreal.ca/download/fca8adddfff353/01-MRO+Industry+Outlook_Kevin+Michaels.pdf |title= MRO Industry Outlook |author= Kevin Michaels |publisher= ICF International |date= April 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Airliner]] MRO should reach $74.3 Billion in 2017 : 51% (${{#expr:74.3*.51round1}}B) [[single-aisle]]s, 21% (${{#expr:74.3*.21round1}}B) long range [[twin-aisle]]s, 8% (${{#expr:74.3*.08round1}}B) medium range twin-aisles, 7% (${{#expr:74.3*.07round1}}B) [[large aircraft]], 6% (${{#expr:74.3*.06round1}}B) [[regional jet]]s as turboprop [[regional airliner]]s and 1% (${{#expr:74.3*.01round1}}B) short range twin-aisles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.mro-network.com/maintenance-repair-overhaul/2017-mro-market-share-category |title= 2017 MRO Market Share by Category |date= Jul 12, 2017 |work= Aviation Week Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Over the 2017-2026 decade, the worldwide market should reach over $900 billion, led  by 23% in North America, 22% in Western Europe, and 19% in Asia Pacific.&lt;ref name=MRO16aug2017&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.mro-network.com/maintenance-repair-overhaul/top-10-engine-mro-demand-2017-26 |title= Top 10 Engine MRO Demand: 2017-26 |date= Aug 16, 2017 |work= Aviation Week Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, of the $70 billion spent by airlines on maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO), 31% were for engines, 27% for components, 24% for line maintenance, 10% for modifications and 8% for the airframe; 70% were for mature airliners ([[Airbus A320]] and [[A330]], [[Boeing 777]] and [[737NG]]), 23% were for “sunset” aircraft ([[MD-80]], [[Boeing 737 Classic]], [[B747]] or [[B757]]) and 7% was spent on modern models ([[Boeing 787]], [[Embraer E-Jet]], [[Airbus A350XWB]] and [[A380]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/opinion-oems-focus-mature-aircraft-aftermarket-growth |title= Opinion: OEMs Focus On Mature Aircraft For Aftermarket Growth |date= Jan 16, 2018 |author= Kevin Michaels |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the commercial aviation industry will need $88 billion for MRO while military aircraft should need $79.6 billion including field maintenance for 46.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/commercial-spending-will-lead-mro-field-2018 |title= Commercial Spending Will Lead MRO Field In 2018 |at= Comparing civil, helicopter, business aviation and military MRO forecasts for 2018 |date= Jan 2, 2018 |author= Lee Ann Shay |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Airliner MRO should reach $115 billion by 2028, a 4% [[compound annual growth rate]] from $77.4 billion in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/global-mro-spend-to-reach-115-billion-by-2028-wym-445243/ |title= Global MRO spend to reach $115 billion by 2028 - Wyman |date= 26 Jan 2018 |author= Aaron Chong |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Major [[Aircraft manufacturer|airframer]]s [[Airbus]], [[Boeing]] and [[Embraer]] enter the market, growing concerns about their [[intellectual property]] sharing, while shared data-supported [[predictive maintenance]] can reduce operational disruptions: among other factors, prognostics helped [[Delta Air Lines]] reduce maintenance cancellations by 98% from 5,600 in 2010 to 78 in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/analysis-airframers-set-out-on-differing-aftermarke-448014/ |title= Airframers set out on differing aftermarket paths |date= 25 Apr 2018 |author= Jon Hemmerdinger |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Insourcing|Insourced]] maintenance can be inefficient for small airlines with a fleet below 50-60 aircraft.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=MRO12mar2018&gt;--&gt; They have to either [[outsource]] it or sell its MRO services to other carriers for better resource utilization.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=MRO12mar2018&gt;--&gt;
For example, the maintenance on [[Comair (South Africa)|South African Comair]]'s 26 [[Boeing 737]]s is outsourced to [[South African Airways|South African Airways']] Technical Department.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=MRO12mar2018&gt;--&gt;
Another example is Spain’s [[Air Nostrum]] operates 45 [[Canadair Regional Jet|CRJ]]s and [[ATR72]]s and its 300-person maintenance department provides line, base maintenance and limited component repair for other airlines 20% of the time.&lt;ref name=MRO12mar2018&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.mro-network.com/airlines/outsourcing-versus-sourcing-small-fleets |title= Outsourcing Versus In-Sourcing For Small Fleets |author= Henry Canaday |date= Mar 12, 2018 |work= Aviation Week Network - MRO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engines ==

The commercial aviation engine MRO market is anticipated by [[Aviation Week]] to be $25.9 billion in 2018, a 2.5 billion increase from 2017, led by 21% for the [[Boeing 737NG]]' CFM56-7B and the A320's CFM56-5B and IAE V2500 (also on the MD-90) tied for second, followed by the mature widebody engines: the GE90 then the Trent 700.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.mro-network.com/maintenance-repair-overhaul/life-old-dogs-yet |title= Life In The Old Dogs Yet |author=James Pozzi |date= Nov 24, 2017 |work= Aviation Week Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the 2017-2026 decade, the largest markets for [[turbofan]]s will be the B737NG's [[CFM56]]-7 with 23%, the [[V2500]]-A5 with 21%, the [[GE90]]-115B with 13%, the A320's CFM56-5B with 13%, the [[PW1000G]] with 7%, the [[Trent 700]] with 6%, the [[CF6]]-80C2 with 5%, the [[CFM LEAP]] with 5% and the [[CF34]]-8 with 4%.&lt;ref name=MRO16aug2017/&gt;
Between 2018 and 2022, the largest MRO demand will be for CFM engines with 36%, followed by GE with 24%, Rolls with 13%, IAE with 12% and Pratt with 7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.mro-network.com/engines-engine-systems/engine-mro-demand-top-5-engine-oem-2018-22 |title= Engine MRO Demand - Top 5 Engine OEM: 2018-22 |date= May 30, 2018 |work= MRO Network |publisher= Aviation Week Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an aircraft gets older, more of its value is transferred to its [[Aircraft engine|engine]]s.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=MRO16oct2017&gt;--&gt;
Along the engine life it is possible to put value back in it with [[repair and overhaul]], to sell it for its remaining useful time, or to disassemble it for its used parts, to extract its remaining value.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=MRO16oct2017&gt;--&gt;
Its maintenance value include the value of [[Aircraft_part#Life_limited_parts|life-limited parts]] (LLPs) and the on-wing time before its performance [[Rebuilding|restoration]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=MRO16oct2017&gt;--&gt;
The core value is the value of its [[Serial number|data plate]] and non-LLPs.&lt;ref name=MRO16oct2017&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.mro-network.com/maintenance-repair-overhaul/keeping-eye-engine-values |title= Keeping An Eye On Engine Values |author= Alex Derber |date= Oct 16, 2017 |work= Aviation Week network}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Engine makers deeply [[Discounts and allowances|discount]] their sales, up to 90%, to win the multi-year stream of spares and services, resembling the [[razor and blades model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.airinsight.com/the-meaningless-game-of-list-prices/ |title= The Meaningless Game of List Prices |date= January 19, 2018 |author= Ernest S.

==Regulation==
Aircraft maintenance is highly regulated, because the smallest slip can lead to an aircraft crashing with consequent loss of life. The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) sets global standards which are then implemented by national and regional bodies around the world.

Local airworthiness authorities include:
*[[Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil]] (ANAC) Brazil
*[[Civil Aviation Administration of China]] (CAAC) China
*[[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)]]  (CAA) United Kingdom
*[[Civil Aviation Safety Authority]] (CASA) Australia
*[[Directorate General of Civil Aviation (India)]] (DGCA) India
*[[European Aviation Safety Agency]] (EASA) Europe
*[[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) United States
*[[Transport Canada]] (TC) Canada

==Personnel==
[[File:Field maintenance on a 1956 model Cessna 172.JPG|thumb|Field maintenance on a [[Cessna 172]] being conducted from a van used to carry tools and parts]]

The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) defines the licensed role of aircraft maintenance (technician/engineer/mechanic), noting that "''The terms in brackets are given as acceptable additions to the title of the license. Each Contracting State is expected to use in its own regulations the one it prefers.''"&lt;ref&gt;ICAO; Doc 7300, ''Convention on International Civil Aviation'' (also referred to as the ''Chicago Convention''), 9th Edn. (2006), [http://www.bucharestairports.ro/files/pages_files/Personnel_Licensing_-_10th_ed_-_July_2006.pdf Annex 1], Chapter 4. Licenses and ratings for personnel other than flight crew members.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, aircraft maintenance technicians, engineers and mechanics all perform essentially the same role. However different countries use these terms in different ways to define their individual levels of qualification and responsibilities.

Recognised licenses for aircraft maintenance personnel include:
*[[Aircraft Maintenance Engineer]] (AME), also called Licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (LAME or L-AME).
*[[Aircraft Maintenance Technician]] (AMT), or colloquially Airframe and Powerplant (A&amp;P).
*Aircraft Maintenance Mechanic (AMM).

As there will be 41,030 new [[airliner]]s by 2036, [[Boeing]] expects 648,000 new commercial airline maintenance technicians from 2017 till then: 256,000 in Asia Pacific (39%), 118,000 in North America (19%) and 111,000 in Europe (17%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Pilot and Technician Outlook |date= 2017 |publisher= Boeing |url= http://www.boeing.com/commercial/market/long-term-market/pilot-and-technician-outlook/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European authorities ===
Aircraft maintenance personnel in Europe must comply with Acceptable Means of Compliance (AMC) Part 66, Certifying Staff, issued by the [[European Aviation Safety Agency]] (EASA).

AMC Part 66 is based on Joint Aviation Regulations (JAR) promulgated by the [[Joint Aviation Authorities]] and on [[Air Transport Association]] (ATA) Specification 104. There are four levels of authorization:
*Level 1: General Familiarisation, Unlicensed
*Level 2: [[Airport ramp|Ramp]] and Transit, Category A
**can only certify own work performed for tasks which he/she has received documented training
*Level 3: Line Certifying Staff and Base Maintenance Supporting Staff, Category B1 (electromechanic) and/or B2(Avionics)
**can certify all work performed on an aircraft/engine for which he/she is type rated excluding base maintenance(generally up to and including A-Check)
*Level 4: Base Maintenance Certifying Staff, Category C
**can certify all work performed on an aircraft/engine for which he/she is type rated, but only if it is base maintenance (additional level-3 staff necessary)
**this authorization does not automatically include any level 2 or level 3 license.

==Checks and inspections==
[[File:Bombardier Maintenance (6240614231).jpg|thumb|Technicians work on a [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] airplane in Dallas, Texas]]
===Routine checks===
{{Main|Aircraft maintenance checks}}
Aircraft maintenance checks are periodic inspections that have to be done on all commercial/civil aircraft after a certain amount of time or usage.

Airbus has indicated that data [[Machine Fault Diagnostics|diagnostic]]s could put an end to aircraft unscheduled grounding for fault repairs around 2025, supported by [[big data]] and operational [[experience]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight12dec2107&gt;--&gt;  [[Predictive maintenance]], diagnostics and [[Health and usage monitoring systems|health monitoring]] could eliminate unscheduled groundings, by making [[Planned maintenance|maintenance schedule]] intervals more frequent to avoid [[Aircraft on ground|AOG]]s and the associated operational interruptions, ultimately eliminating them.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight12dec2107&gt;--&gt; Data or [[Condition monitoring|monitoring]] can tell that some parts do not need a scheduled check, but a full transition to this model will need much greater experience.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Flight12dec2107&gt;--&gt; With more history, examples and [[regulatory]] confidence, the maintenance manual could become a dynamic document for each specific aircraft with every check and interval based on its operational history.&lt;ref name=Flight12dec2107&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/airbus-sees-big-data-delivering-zero-aog-goal-wit-444100/ |title= Airbus sees big data delivering 'zero-AOG' goal within 10 years |date= 12 Dec 2017 |author= Max Kingsley-Jones |work= Flightglobal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maintenance release===
At the completion of any maintenance task a person authorized by the national airworthiness authority signs a maintenance release stating that maintenance has been performed in accordance with the applicable airworthiness requirements. In the case of a [[type certificate|certified aircraft]] this may be an [[Aircraft Maintenance Engineer]] or [[Aircraft Maintenance Technician]], while for [[homebuilt aircraft|amateur-built aircraft]] this may be the owner or builder of the aircraft.&lt;ref name="CAR571.10"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/civilaviation/regserv/cars/part5-standards-571s-1827.htm |title= Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs)Part V - Standard 571 - Maintenance |at= 571.10 Maintenance Release |publisher= [[Transport Canada]] |date= 2010-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashesi University''' is a private college located in [[Ghana]], [[West Africa]].

The mission of Ashesi University is to educate ethical, entrepreneurial leaders in Africa.

In 2017, Ashesi was awarded the World Innovation Summit in Education Prize,{{cn|date=November 2018}} one of the world’s biggest prizes in education, for its impact on higher education in Africa. In 2018, Ashesi was also awarded a Charter by the President of Ghana, granting it full independence as a nationally recognised degree-granting institution. It was the youngest university to have been granted a Presidential Charter in Ghana’s history, a rare accomplishment.

Ashesi offers a four-year bachelors programme grounded in a multidisciplinary core curriculum, featuring majors in [[Business Administration]], [[Management Information Systems]], [[Computer science|Computer Science]], Electrical and [[Electronic engineering|Electronic Engineering]], [[Computer engineering|Computer Engineering]] and [[Mechanical engineering|Mechanical Engineering.]] With an academic program designed in collaboration with some of the world's best universities and organisations, Ashesi continues to shape an educational experience like no other in Africa.

==Membership==
* Association of American Colleges and Universities
* Council of Independent Universities
* Association of African Universities

==History==
Ashesi was founded by [[Patrick Awuah]], a Ghanaian who spent over 15 years living and working in the United States. [[Patrick Awuah, Jr.|Awuah]] left Ghana in 1985 to attend [[Swarthmore College]] on a full scholarship, after which he worked for [[Microsoft|Microsoft Corporation]] as an engineer and a program manager for eight years. Experiencing first hand the dramatic impact that education can have on one's life, [[Patrick Awuah, Jr.|Awuah]] embarked on a mission in 1997 to provide greater educational opportunities in [[Ghana]]. He enrolled in business school at the University of California at Berkeley's Haas School of Business, both to evaluate the feasibility of his goal and to gain managerial skills with which to found and manage a university.

*1997: Founder Patrick Awuah gives up his US software career to return to [[Africa]]. He decides to create a new kind of African university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wesler|first1=Ellen|title=A Winner of MacArthur Award Brought Liberal-Arts Education to Ghana|url=http://chronicle.com/article/A-Winner-of-MacArthur-Award/233894?cid=gn&amp;elq=449cf51f5a15482cbc18c4579bfa7459&amp;elqCampaignId=1711&amp;elqaid=6713&amp;elqat=1&amp;elqTrackId=86232f7ba38a439ab8bcaf43ddaae8e9|accessdate=4 December 2015|work=Chronicle of Higher Education|date=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Meaning of Ashesi==
 [[File:Ashesi_Todd_&amp;_Ruth_Warren_Library.jpg |frame|The Todd &amp; Ruth Warren Library at Ashesi|alt=The Todd &amp; Ruth Warren Library at Ashesi]]
"If there is anything you can do, or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it. Begin it now."
 
These words by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe are the inspiration behind the university's name, Ashesi, which means "beginning" in Fante, a native Ghanaian language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashesi.edu.gh/about/history.html#Meaning_of_Ashesi History: Meaning of Ashesi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117100304/http://www.ashesi.edu.gh/about/history.html#Meaning_of_Ashesi |date=17 November 2011 }}. ''ashesi.edu.gh''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feasibility study==
During the summer of 1998, a team of four MBA students from UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business travelled to Ghana to conduct extensive market research and evaluate the feasibility of establishing a new university. With the goal of gathering data to provide a foundation for business decisions, the team administered over 3,300 surveys to students and parents; conducted interviews and focus groups with parents, teachers and business leaders; and gathered secondary information from local and international sources. The result was a comprehensive feasibility study,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashesi.edu.gh/NEWS/BULLETIN/EARLIEST_YEARS/FEASIBILITY_STUDY/feasibility_study.html Early years feasibility study] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106021317/http://www.ashesi.edu.gh/NEWS/BULLETIN/EARLIEST_YEARS/FEASIBILITY_STUDY/feasibility_study.html |date=6 January 2011 }}. ''ashesi.edu.gh''.&lt;/ref&gt; analysing Ghanaian tertiary education.

==Ashesi campus==
Set on 100 acres in Berekuso, overlooking Ghana's capital city of Accra, Ashesi’s campus unites traditional Ghanaian design, modern technology and environmental best practices. The  campus has interconnected courtyards, that emphasize a sense of community. The architecture borrows from the Ghanaian vernacular, with echoes of traditional compound houses, as well as elements of traditional Northern dwellings. The natural contours of the site are used in concert with buildings to create exterior gathering spaces throughout campus, as well as ramps that provide wheel chair access to buildings.  Buildings are designed to maximize natural views, light and ventilation.

Ground water is supplemented with harvested rainwater, filtered and treated to provide potable water all year round. A community-scale sewage and organic treatment plant provides environmental and economic benefits by converting waste to biogas for some of the campus’ cooking needs and recycling treated water for landscaping.

==Global Recognition==
On Wednesday 3 May 2018, [[President of the Republic of Ghana]], H.E [[Nana Akufo-Addo]] awarded Ashesi University a Presidential Charter meaning the University will now award degrees to its graduated in its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.myjoyonline.com|title=Akufo-Addo grants Ashesi University Presidential Charter|last=Ibrahim|first=Abubakar|date=3 May 2018|work=Myjoyonline|access-date=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashesi, until this year was affiliated to the University of Cape Coast(UCC), Ghana meaning its graduates were awarded a UCC degree.

In 2012, the university was ranked by [[PwC]] as the seventh most respected organisation in Ghana, becoming the first university to make the list. Ashesi's President, Dr. Patrick Awuah, was also ranked the 4th Most Respected CEO in Ghana.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thechronicle.com.gh/ut-bank-rlg-bosses-outshine-rivals-at-ghanas-most-respected-ceo-awards/ UT Bank, Rlg bosses outshine rivals –at Ghana’s Most Respected CEO awards].

''http://africa.com''. February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been ranked as one of Ghana's 50 Best Places to work (2015), according to a survey by Ghanaian consulting firm Goodman AMC; it was again, the only university on the list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goodmanamc.blogspot.com/2015/03/top-50-best-places-to-work-in-ghana.html Top 50 Best Places to Work in Ghana]. ''http://goodmanamc.blogspot.com''. March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[CNN]] shared the story of Ashesi and its founder on its African Voices programme. In the interview, Ashesi's President said: "If you come back in 30 years, universities will be competing for the best and brightest students. I hope that universities will also be competing on things such as whose students are the most ethical. If that happens, it will change the continent."&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/05/01/world/africa/patrick-awuah-ashesi-ghana/ Millionaire who quit Microsoft to educate Africa's future leaders]. ''http://cnn.com''. May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Ashesi's President was ranked by [[Fortune (magazine)]] as one of the World's 50 Greatest Leaders, together with the likes of [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates]], [[Pope Francis]] and founder of [[Amazon.com]], [[Jeff Bezos]]. The list according to Forbes, was made up of men and women who "in an era that feels starved for leadership, will inspire you—some famous, others little known, all of them energizing their followers and making the world better." &lt;ref&gt;[http://fortune.com/2014/03/20/worlds-50-greatest-leaders/ The World's 50 Greatest Leaders: 2015]. ''http://fortune.com''. March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Ashesi was awarded the [https://www.wise-qatar.org/2017-wise-prize-education-patrick-awuah World Innovation Summit in Education Prize], one of the world’s biggest prizes in education, for its impact on higher education in Africa. In 2018, Ashesi was also awarded a Charter by the President of Ghana, granting it full independence as a nationally recognised degree-granting institution. It was the youngest university to have been granted a Presidential Charter in Ghana’s history, a rare accomplishment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3089">'''Asian studies''', a term used usually in [[North America]] for [[Oriental studies]] and is concerned with the  [[Asia]]n people, their cultures, languages, history and politics. Within the Asian sphere, Asian studies combines aspects of [[sociology]], [[history]], [[cultural anthropology]] and many other disciplines to study political, cultural and economic phenomena in Asian traditional and contemporary societies. Asian studies forms a field of [[post-graduate study]] in many universities.

It is a branch of [[area studies]], and many Western universities combine Asian and [[African studies]] in a single faculty or institute, like [[SOAS]] in London.  It is often combined with [[Islamic studies]] in a similar way.  The history of the discipline in the West is covered under [[Oriental studies]].

{{Atmospheric sciences| atmophys=true}}
'''Atmospheric physics''' is the application of [[physics]] to the study of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Atmospheric physicists attempt to model [[Earth's atmosphere]] and the atmospheres of the other [[planet]]s using [[fluid dynamics|fluid flow]] equations, [[chemistry|chemical]] models, [[radiation budget]], and energy transfer processes in the atmosphere (as well as how these tie into other systems such as the oceans). In order to model weather systems, atmospheric physicists employ elements of [[scattering theory]], wave propagation models, [[cloud physics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[spatial statistics]] which are highly mathematical and related to physics. It has close links to [[meteorology]] and [[climatology]] and also covers the design and construction of instruments for studying the atmosphere and the interpretation of the data they provide, including [[remote sensing]] instruments. At the dawn of the space age and the introduction of sounding rockets, [[aeronomy]] became a subdiscipline concerning the upper layers of the atmosphere, where dissociation and ionization are important.

== Remote sensing ==
[[Image:weather radar.jpg|thumb|left|Brightness can indicate reflectivity as in this 1960 [[weather radar]] image (of [[1960 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Abby|Hurricane Abby]]). The radar's frequency, pulse form, and antenna largely determine what it can observe.]]

{{Main|Remote sensing}}
Remote sensing is the small or large-scale acquisition of information of an object or phenomenon, by the use of either recording or real-time sensing device(s) that is not in physical or intimate contact with the object (such as by way of [[aircraft]], [[spacecraft]], [[satellite]], [[buoy]], or [[ship]]). In practice, remote sensing is the stand-off collection through the use of a variety of devices for gathering information on a given object or area which gives more information than sensors at individual sites might convey.&lt;ref&gt;COMET program (1999). [http://www.comet.ucar.edu/nsflab/web/remote/121.htm Remote Sensing.] [[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]]. Retrieved on 2009-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Earth observation]] or [[weather satellite]] collection platforms, ocean and atmospheric observing [[weather buoy]] platforms, monitoring of a pregnancy via [[ultrasound]], [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI), [[Positron Emission Tomography]] (PET), and [[space probes]] are all examples of remote sensing. In modern usage, the term generally refers to the use of imaging sensor technologies including but not limited to the use of instruments aboard aircraft and spacecraft, and is distinct from other imaging-related fields such as [[medical imaging]].

There are two kinds of remote sensing. Passive sensors detect natural radiation that is emitted or reflected by the object or surrounding area being observed. Reflected sunlight is the most common source of radiation measured by passive sensors. Examples of passive remote sensors include film [[photography]], infra-red, [[charge-coupled devices]], and [[radiometer]]s. Active collection, on the other hand, emits energy in order to scan objects and areas whereupon a sensor then detects and measures the radiation that is reflected or backscattered from the target. [[radar]], [[lidar]], and [[SODAR]] are examples of active remote sensing techniques used in atmospheric physics where the time delay between emission and return is measured, establishing the location, height, speed and direction of an object.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology (2009). [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=radar1 Radar.] [[American Meteorological Society]]. Retrieved on 2009-24-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remote sensing makes it possible to collect data on dangerous or inaccessible areas. Remote sensing applications include monitoring [[deforestation]] in areas such as the [[Amazon Basin]], the effects of [[climate change]] on [[glacier]]s and Arctic and Antarctic regions, and [[depth sounding]] of coastal and ocean depths. Military collection during the [[cold war]] made use of stand-off collection of data about dangerous border areas. Remote sensing also replaces costly and slow data collection on the ground, ensuring in the process that areas or objects are not disturbed.

Orbital platforms collect and transmit data from different parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], which in conjunction with larger scale aerial or ground-based sensing and analysis, provides researchers with enough information to monitor trends such as [[El Niño]] and other natural long and short term phenomena. Other uses include different areas of the [[earth science]]s such as [[natural resource management]], agricultural fields such as land usage and conservation, and national security and overhead, ground-based and stand-off collection on border areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[NASA]] (2009).

== Radiation ==
[[Image:seasons.svg|frame|right|This is a diagram of the seasons.  In addition to the density of incident light, the [[dissipation]] of light in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is greater when it falls at a shallow angle.]]
{{see also|Radiation|Effect of sun angle on climate}}
Atmospheric physicists typically divide radiation into solar radiation (emitted by the sun) and terrestrial radiation (emitted by Earth's surface and atmosphere). 

Solar radiation contains variety of wavelengths. Visible light has wavelengths between 0.4 and 0.7&amp;nbsp;micrometers.&lt;ref&gt;Atmospheric Science Data Center. [http://science-edu.larc.nasa.gov/EDDOCS/Wavelengths_for_Colors.html What Wavelength Goes With a Color?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720105431/http://science-edu.larc.nasa.gov/EDDOCS/Wavelengths_for_Colors.html |date=2011-07-20 }} Retrieved on 2008-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Shorter wavelengths are known as the [[ultraviolet]] (UV) part of the spectrum, while longer wavelengths are grouped into the [[infrared]] portion of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Windows to the Universe. [http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/Atmosphere/earth_atmosph_radiation_budget.html Solar Energy in Earth's Atmosphere.] Retrieved on 2008-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone is most effective in absorbing radiation around 0.25&amp;nbsp;micrometers,&lt;ref name="UDE"&gt;[[University of Delaware]].

This increases the temperature of the nearby [[stratosphere]]. Snow reflects 88% of UV rays,&lt;ref name="UDE"/&gt; while sand reflects 12%, and water reflects only 4% of incoming UV radiation.&lt;ref name="UDE"/&gt; The more glancing the angle is between the atmosphere and the [[sun]]'s rays, the more likely that energy will be reflected or absorbed by the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheeling Jesuit University. [http://www.cet.edu/ete/modules/ozone/ozatmo.html Exploring the Environment:  UV Menace.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830094306/http://www.cet.edu/ete/modules/ozone/ozatmo.html |date=August 30, 2007 }} Retrieved on 2007-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrestrial radiation is emitted at much longer wavelengths than solar radiation. This is because Earth is much colder than the sun.   Radiation is emitted by Earth across a range of wavelengths, as formalized in [[Planck's law]]. The wavelength of maximum energy is around 10 micrometers.

== Cloud physics ==
{{Main|Cloud physics}}
Cloud physics is the study of the physical processes that lead to the formation, growth and precipitation of [[cloud]]s. Clouds are composed of microscopic droplets of water (warm clouds), tiny crystals of ice, or both (mixed phase clouds). Under suitable conditions, the droplets combine to form [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], where they may fall to the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Oklahoma Weather Modification Demonstration Program. [http://www.evac.ou.edu/okwmdp/physics.html CLOUD PHYSICS.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723154301/http://www.evac.ou.edu/okwmdp/physics.html |date=2008-07-23 }} Retrieved on 2008-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The precise mechanics of how a cloud forms and grows is not completely understood, but scientists have developed theories explaining the structure of clouds by studying the microphysics of individual droplets. Advances in radar and satellite technology have also allowed the precise study of clouds on a large scale.

== Atmospheric electricity ==
[[Image:Lightning over Oradea Romania 3.jpg|thumb|right|Cloud to ground [[Lightning]] in the global atmospheric electrical circuit.]]

Atmospheric electricity is the term given to the electrostatics and electrodynamics of the atmosphere (or, more broadly, the atmosphere of any [[planet]]).

Sound and Fury.] Retrieved on 2008-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Atmospheric tide ==
{{Main|Atmospheric tide}}
The largest-amplitude atmospheric tides are mostly generated in the [[troposphere]] and [[stratosphere]] when the atmosphere is periodically heated as water vapour and ozone absorb solar radiation during the day. The tides generated are then able to propagate away from these source regions and ascend into the [[mesosphere]] and [[thermosphere]]. Atmospheric tides can be measured as regular fluctuations in wind, temperature, density and pressure. Although atmospheric tides share much in common with ocean tides they have two key distinguishing features:

i) Atmospheric tides are primarily excited by the Sun's heating of the atmosphere whereas ocean tides are primarily excited by the Moon's gravitational field. This means that most atmospheric tides have periods of oscillation related to the 24-hour length of the solar day whereas ocean tides have longer periods of oscillation related to the lunar day (time between successive lunar transits) of about 24 hours 51 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=atmospheric-tide1 Atmospheric Tide.] Retrieved on 2008-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

ii) Atmospheric tides propagate in an atmosphere where density varies significantly with height. A consequence of this is that their amplitudes naturally increase exponentially as the tide ascends into progressively more rarefied regions of the atmosphere (for an explanation of this phenomenon, see below). In contrast, the density of the oceans varies only slightly with depth and so there the tides do not necessarily vary in amplitude with depth.

Note that although solar heating is responsible for the largest-amplitude atmospheric tides, the gravitational fields of the Sun and Moon also raise tides in the atmosphere, with the lunar gravitational atmospheric tidal effect being significantly greater than its solar counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific American. [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=does-the-moon-have-a-tida Does the Moon have a tidal effect on the atmosphere as well as the oceans?.] Retrieved on 2008-07-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

At ground level, atmospheric tides can be detected as regular but small oscillations in surface pressure with periods of 24 and 12 hours.  Daily pressure maxima occur at 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. local time, while minima occur at 4 a.m. and 4 p.m. local time.  The absolute maximum occurs at 10 a.m. while the absolute minimum occurs at 4 p.m.&lt;ref&gt;Dr James B. Calvert. [http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/geol/tides.htm Tidal Observations.] Retrieved on 2008-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at greater heights the amplitudes of the tides can become very large. In the [[mesosphere]] (heights of ~ 50 – 100&amp;nbsp;km) atmospheric tides can reach amplitudes of more than 50&amp;nbsp;m/s and are often the most significant part of the motion of the atmosphere.

== Aeronomy ==
{{Main|Aeronomy}}
[[Image:Upperatmoslight1.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Representation of upper-atmospheric lightning and electrical-discharge phenomena]]
Aeronomy is the science of the upper region of the atmosphere, where dissociation and ionization are important. The term aeronomy was introduced by Sydney Chapman in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew F. Nagy, p. 1-2 in ''Comparative Aeronomy'', ed. by Andrew F. Nagy ''et al.'' (Springer 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-387-87824-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the term also includes the science of the corresponding regions of the atmospheres of other planets.  Research in aeronomy requires access to balloons, satellites, and [[sounding rockets]] which provide valuable data about this region of the atmosphere.  [[Atmospheric tide]]s play an important role in interacting with both the lower and upper atmosphere.  Amongst the phenomena studied are [[upper-atmospheric lightning]] discharges, such as luminous events called red [[sprites (lightning)|sprites]], sprite halos, blue jets, and elves.

== Centers of research ==
In the UK, atmospheric studies are underpinned by the [[Met Office]], the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] and the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]]. Divisions of the U.S. [[NOAA|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)]] oversee research projects and [[weather]] modeling involving atmospheric physics. The US [[Arecibo Observatory|National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center]] also carries out studies of the high atmosphere. In [[Belgium]], the [[Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy]] studies the atmosphere and [[outer space]].

{{Redirect|Brackish|the Kittie song|Brackish (song)}}
{{Water salinity}}
'''Brackish water''' is water that has more [[salt]]  than [[freshwater]], but not as much as [[seawater]]. It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water, as in [[estuary|estuaries]], or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers. The word comes from the Middle Dutch root "[[:wikt:brak#Dutch|brak]]". Certain human activities can produce brackish water, in particular civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish water pools for freshwater prawn farming. Brackish water is also the primary waste product of the [[Osmotic power|salinity gradient power]] process. Because brackish water is hostile to the growth of most terrestrial plant species, without appropriate management it is damaging to the environment (see article on [[shrimp farms]]).

Technically, brackish water contains between 0.5 and 30&amp;nbsp;grams of [[salt]] per litre—more often expressed as 0.5 to 30 [[parts per thousand]] (‰), which is a [[specific gravity]] of between 1.005 and 1.010. Thus, ''brackish'' covers a range of [[Salinity#Systems of classification of water bodies based upon salinity|salinity regimes]] and is not considered a precisely defined condition. It is characteristic of many brackish surface waters that their salinity can vary considerably over space or time.

== Brackish water habitats ==

=== Estuaries ===
[[File:Monodactylus argenteus.JPG|thumb|A brackish water fish: ''[[Silver moony|Monodactylus argenteus]]'']]

Brackish water condition commonly occurs when fresh water meets seawater. In fact, the most extensive brackish water habitats worldwide are [[estuary|estuaries]], where a river meets the sea.

The [[River Thames]] flowing through [[London]] is a classic river estuary. The town of [[Teddington]] a few miles west of London marks the boundary between the tidal and non-tidal parts of the Thames, although it is still considered a freshwater river about as far east as [[Battersea]] insofar as the average salinity is very low and the fish fauna consists predominantly of freshwater species such as [[Rutilus|roach]], [[Common dace|dace]], [[carp]], [[perch]], and [[pike (fish)|pike]]. The [[Thames Estuary]] becomes brackish between Battersea and [[Gravesend, Kent|Gravesend]], and the diversity of freshwater fish species present is smaller, primarily roach and dace; [[euryhaline]] marine species such as [[flounder]], [[European seabass]], [[mullet (fish)|mullet]], and [[Smelt (fish)|smelt]] become much more common. Further east, the salinity increases and the freshwater fish species are completely replaced by euryhaline marine ones, until the river reaches Gravesend, at which point conditions become fully marine and the fish fauna resembles that of the adjacent [[North Sea]] and includes both euryhaline and [[stenohaline]] marine species. A similar pattern of replacement can be observed with the aquatic plants and invertebrates living in the river.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-river-thames.co.uk/thames.htm The River Thames – its geology, geography and vital statistics from source to sea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100516000937/http://www.the-river-thames.co.uk/thames.htm |date=2010-05-16 }}, The-River-Thames.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-river-thames.co.uk/wildlife.htm The River Thames – its natural history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818220921/http://www.the-river-thames.co.uk/wildlife.htm |date=2006-08-18 }} The-River-Thames.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of [[ecological succession]] from a freshwater to marine [[ecosystem]] is typical of river estuaries. River estuaries form important staging points during the migration of [[Fish migration|anadromous and catadromous]] fish species, such as [[salmon]], [[American shad|shad]], and [[eel]]s, giving them time to form social groups and to adjust to the changes in salinity. Salmon are anadromous, meaning they live in the sea but ascend rivers to spawn; eels are catadromous, living in rivers and streams, but returning to the sea to breed. Besides the species that migrate through estuaries, there are many other fish that use them as "nursery grounds" for spawning or as places young fish can feed and grow before moving elsewhere. [[Herring]] and [[plaice]] are two commercially important species that use the Thames Estuary for this purpose.

Estuaries are also commonly used as fishing grounds, and as places for fish farming or ranching.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eattilapia.com/tilapia-farming.php  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929170847/http://www.eattilapia.com/tilapia-farming.php |date=September 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[Atlantic salmon]] farms are often located in estuaries, although this has caused controversy, because in doing so, fish farmers expose migrating wild fish to large numbers of external [[parasitism|parasites]] such as [[sea lice]] that escape from the pens the farmed fish are kept in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saveourseatrout.com/|title=脱毛の口コミまとめ|work=saveourseatrout.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717032912/http://www.saveourseatrout.com/|archivedate=2006-07-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mangroves ===
Another important brackish water habitat is the [[mangrove swamp]] or '''mangal'''. Many, though not all, mangrove swamps fringe estuaries and lagoons where the salinity changes with each tide. Among the most specialised residents of mangrove forests are [[mudskippers]], fish that forage for food on land, and [[archer fish]], perch-like fish that "spit" at insects and other small animals living in the trees, knocking them into the water where they can be eaten. Like estuaries, mangrove swamps are extremely important breeding grounds for many fish, with species such as [[Lutjanidae|snappers]], [[halfbeak]]s, and [[tarpon]] spawning or maturing among them. Besides fish, numerous other animals use mangroves, including such species as the  [[saltwater crocodile]], [[American crocodile]], [[proboscis monkey]], [[diamondback terrapin]], and the [[Crab-eating Frog|crab-eating frog]], ''Fejervarya cancrivora'' (formerly ''Rana cancrivora''). Mangroves represent important nesting site for numerous birds groups such as herons, storks, spoonbills, ibises, kingfishers, shorebirds and seabirds.

Although often plagued with [[mosquito]]es and other insects that make them unpleasant for humans, mangrove swamps are very important buffer zones between land and sea, and are a natural defense against hurricane and tsunami damage in particular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&amp;itemid=1823&amp;language=1 Mangrove forests 'can reduce impact of tsunamis'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618043027/http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readnews&amp;itemid=1823&amp;language=1 |date=2006-06-18 }}, Science and Development Network, December 30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sundarbans]] and [[Bhitarkanika Mangroves]] are two of the large mangrove forests in the world, both on the coast of the [[Bay of Bengal]].

=== Brackish seas and lakes ===
Some seas and lakes are brackish. The [[Baltic Sea]] is a brackish sea adjoining the [[North Sea]]. Originally the [[confluence]] of [[Eridanos (geology)|two major river systems]] prior to the [[Pleistocene]], since then it has been flooded by the North Sea but still receives so much freshwater from the adjacent lands that the water is brackish. Because the salt water coming in from the sea is denser than freshwater, the water in the Baltic is stratified, with salt water at the bottom and freshwater at the top. Limited mixing occurs because of the lack of tides and storms, with the result that the fish fauna at the surface is freshwater in composition while that lower down is more marine. [[Cod]] are an example of a species only found in deep water in the Baltic, while [[Northern pike|pike]] are confined to the less [[saline water|saline]] surface waters.

The [[Caspian Sea]] is the world's largest lake and contains brackish water with a salinity about one-third that of normal [[seawater]]. The Caspian is famous for its peculiar animal fauna, including one of the few non-marine seals (the [[Caspian seal]]) and the great [[sturgeon]]s, a major source of [[caviar]].

The [[Hudson Bay]] is a brackish [[marginal sea]] of the [[arctic ocean]], it remains brackish due its limited connections to the open ocean, very high levels freshwater [[surface runoff]] input from the large [[Hudson Bay drainage basin]], and low rate of evaporation due to being completely covered in ice for over half the year.

In the [[Black Sea]] the surface water is brackish with an average salinity of about 17-18 parts per thousand compared to 30 to 40 for the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;Lüning, K., Yarish, C. &amp; Kirkman, H. ''Seaweeds: their environment, biogeography, and ecophysiology.'' Wiley-IEEE, 1990. p. 121. {{ISBN|978-0-471-62434-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deep, [[anoxic event|anoxic]] water of the Black Sea originates from warm, salty water of the [[Mediterranean]].

'''Cladistics''' ({{IPAc-en|k|l|ə|ˈ|d|ɪ|s|t|ɪ|k|s}}, from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|κλάδος}}, ''cládos'', "branch")&lt;ref name="OnlineEtDict"&gt;{{cite web|title=clade|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=clade&amp;searchmode=none|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an approach to [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]] in which [[organism]]s are categorized in groups ("[[clade]]s") based on the [[most recent common ancestor]]. Hypothesized relationships are typically based on shared derived characteristics ([[synapomorphies]]'')'' that can be traced to the most recent common ancestor and are not present in more distant groups and ancestors. A key feature of a clade is that a common ancestor and all its descendants are part of the clade. Importantly, all descendants stay in their overarching ancestral clade. For example, if within a ''strict'' cladistic framework the terms animals, bilateria/worms, fishes/vertebrata, or monkeys/anthropoidea would be used, these terms would include humans. Many of these terms are normally used [[Paraphyly|paraphyletically]], outside of cladistics, e.g. as a '[[Evolutionary grade|grade]]'. [[Evolutionary radiation|Radiation]] results in the generation of new subclades by bifurcation.&lt;ref name=ce&gt;Columbia Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ucmp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/clad/clad1.html |title=Introduction to Cladistics |publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2014-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ode&gt;Oxford Dictionary of English&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oed&gt;Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

The techniques and nomenclature of cladistics have been applied to other disciplines.  (See [[phylogenetic nomenclature]].)

Cladistics is now the most commonly used method to classify organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/clad/clad5.html|title=The Need for Cladistics|website=www.ucmp.berkeley.edu|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original methods used in cladistic analysis and the school of taxonomy derived from the work of the German [[entomologist]] [[Willi Hennig]], who referred to it as '''phylogenetic systematics''' (also the title of his 1966 book); the terms "cladistics" and "clade" were popularized by other researchers. Cladistics in the original sense refers to a particular set of methods used in [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analysis, although it is now sometimes used to refer to the whole field.{{sfn|ps=|Brinkman|Leipe|2001|p=323}}

What is now called the cladistic method appeared as early as 1901 with a work by [[Peter Chalmers Mitchell]] for birds&lt;ref&gt;Schuh, Randall. 2000. Biological Systematics: Principles and Applications, p.7 (citing Nelson and Platnick, 1981).

Div. 225-52 (kfolinsb.public.iastate.edu)&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently by [[Robert John Tillyard]] (for insects) in 1921,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Trees of life: Essays in the philosophy of biology|last = Craw|first = RC|publisher = Kluwer Academic|year = 1992|isbn = 978-94-015-8038-0|location = Dordrecht|pages = 65–107|editor-last = Griffiths|editor-first = PE|chapter = Margins of cladistics: Identity, differences and place in the emergence of phylogenetic systematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Walter Max Zimmerman|W. Zimmermann]] (for plants) in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Schuh, Randall. 2000. Biological Systematics: Principles and Applications, p.7. Cornell U. Press&lt;/ref&gt;
The term "[[clade]]" was introduced in 1958 by [[Julian Huxley]] after having been coined by [[Lucien Cuénot]] in 1940,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cuénot|1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; "cladogenesis" in 1958,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Webster's 9th New Collegiate Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; "cladistic" by [[Arthur Cain|Cain]] and Harrison in 1960,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cain|Harrison|1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; "cladist" (for an adherent of Hennig's school) by [[Ernst Mayr|Mayr]] in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dupuis|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "cladistics" in 1966.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Hennig referred to his own approach as "phylogenetic systematics". From the time of his original formulation until the end of the 1970s, cladistics competed as an analytical and philosophical approach to phylogenetic inference with [[phenetics]] and so-called [[evolutionary taxonomy]]. Phenetics was championed at this time by the [[Numerical taxonomy|numerical taxonomists]] [[Peter Sneath]] and [[Robert Sokal]] and the evolutionary taxonomist [[Ernst Mayr]].

Originally conceived, if only in essence, by Willi Hennig in a book published in 1950, cladistics did not flourish until its translation into English in 1966 (Lewin 1997). Today, cladistics is the most popular method for constructing phylogenies from morphological and molecular data. Unlike phenetics, cladistics is specifically aimed at reconstructing evolutionary histories.

In the 1990s, the development of effective [[polymerase chain reaction]] techniques allowed the application of cladistic methods to [[biochemical]] and [[molecular genetics|molecular genetic]] traits of organisms, as well as to anatomical ones, vastly expanding the amount of data available for phylogenetics. At the same time, cladistics rapidly became the dominant set of methods of phylogenetics in evolutionary biology, because [[computer]]s made it possible to process large quantities of data about organisms and their characteristics.

The way for [[computational phylogenetics]] was paved by [[phenetics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1982|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; a set of methods commonly used from the 1950s to 1980s and to some degree later. Phenetics did not try to reconstruct phylogenetic trees; rather, it tried to build [[dendrograms]] from similarity data; its algorithms required less computer power than phylogenetic ones.

== Methodology ==
{{Main|Phylogenetics|Cladogram}}
{{See also|Phylogenetic tree}}
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}

The cladistic method interprets each character state transformation implied by the distribution of shared character states among taxa (or other terminals) as a potential piece of evidence for grouping. The outcome of a cladistic analysis is a [[cladogram]] – a [[Tree (graph theory)|tree]]-shaped diagram ([[dendrogram]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weygoldt|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is interpreted to represent the best hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships. Although traditionally such cladograms were generated largely on the basis of morphological characters and originally calculated by hand, [[DNA sequencing|genetic sequencing]] data and [[computational phylogenetics]] are now commonly used in phylogenetic analyses, and the [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|parsimony]] criterion has been abandoned by many phylogeneticists in favor of more "sophisticated" but less parsimonious evolutionary models of character state transformation. Cladists contend that these models are unjustified.{{Why|date=May 2013}}

Every cladogram is based on a particular dataset analyzed with a particular method. Datasets are tables consisting of [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular]], morphological, [[Ethology|ethological]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jerison|2003|p=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; and/or other characters and a list of [[operational taxonomic unit]]s (OTUs), which may be genes, individuals, populations, species, or larger taxa that are presumed to be monophyletic and therefore to form, all together, one large clade; phylogenetic analysis infers the branching pattern within that clade. Different datasets and different methods, not to mention violations of the mentioned assumptions, often result in different cladograms. Only scientific investigation can show which is more likely to be correct.

Until recently, for example, cladograms like the following have generally been accepted as accurate representations of the ancestral relations among turtles, lizards, crocodilians, and birds:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Vertebrate Palaeontology |last=Benton |first=Michael J. |authorlink=Michael Benton |year=2005 |publisher=Blackwell |isbn=978-0-632-05637-8 |pages=214, 233}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
{{clade

         }}
      }}
   }}
}}
&lt;/center&gt;

If this phylogenetic hypothesis is correct, then the last common ancestor of turtles and birds, at the branch near the {{color|LimeGreen|▼}} lived earlier than the last common ancestor of lizards and birds, near the {{font|size=150%|color=OrangeRed|text=♦}}. Most [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular evidence]], however, produces cladograms more like this:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Lyson |first1=Tyler |last2=Gilbert |first2=Scott F. |date=March–April 2009 |title=Turtles all the way down: loggerheads at the root of the chelonian tree |journal=Evolution &amp; Development |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=133–135 |doi=10.1111/j.1525-142X.2009.00325.x |url=http://www.mrfdigs.com/publications/2009_lyson-gilbert-loggerheads.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
{{clade
|label1=[[Diapsid]]a&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{font|size=150%|color=OrangeRed|text=♦}}

         |2=[[bird]]s
         }}
      }}
   }}
}}
&lt;/center&gt;

If this is accurate, then the last common ancestor of turtles and birds lived later than the last common ancestor of lizards and birds. Since the cladograms provide competing accounts of real events, at most one of them is correct.

[[File:Monophyly, paraphyly, polyphyly.png|thumb|400px|right|Cladogram of the [[primate]]s, showing a [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] taxon (a [[clade]]: the simians or Anthropoidea, in yellow), a [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] taxon (the prosimians, in blue, including the red patch), and a [[Polyphyly|polyphyletic]] taxon (the nocturnal primates – the [[loris]]es and the [[tarsier]]s – in red)]]

The cladogram to the right represents the current universally accepted hypothesis that all [[primate]]s, including [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhines]] like the [[lemur]]s and [[loris]]es, had a common ancestor all of whose descendants were primates, and so form a clade; the name Primates is therefore recognized for this clade. Within the primates, all anthropoids (monkeys, apes and humans) are hypothesized to have had a common ancestor all of whose descendants were anthropoids, so they form the clade called Anthropoidea. The "prosimians", on the other hand, form a paraphyletic taxon. The name Prosimii is not used in [[phylogenetic nomenclature]], which names only clades; the "prosimians" are instead divided between the clades [[Strepsirrhini|Strepsirhini]] and [[Haplorhini]], where the latter contains Tarsiiformes and Anthropoidea.

== Terminology for character states ==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2016}}
The following terms, coined by Hennig, are used to identify shared or distinct character states among groups:&lt;ref name="Patterson 1982"&gt;{{harvnb|Patterson|1982|pp=21–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Patterson 1988"&gt;{{Harvnb|Patterson|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="de Pinna 1991"&gt;{{Harvnb|de Pinna|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{anchor|plesiomorphy}} A '''[[plesiomorphy]]''' ("close form") or '''ancestral state''' is a character state that a taxon has retained from its ancestors. When two or more taxa that are not nested within each other share a plesiomorphy, it is a '''symplesiomorphy''' (from ''syn-'', "together"). Symplesiomorphies do not mean that the taxa that exhibit that character state are necessarily closely related. For example, Reptilia is traditionally characterized by (among other things) being [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]] (i.e., not maintaining a constant high body temperature), whereas birds are [[Homeothermy|warm-blooded]]. Since cold-bloodedness is a plesiomorphy, inherited from the common ancestor of traditional reptiles and birds, and thus a symplesiomorphy of turtles, snakes and crocodiles (among others), it does not mean that turtles, snakes and crocodiles form a clade that excludes the birds.
* {{anchor|apomorphy}}{{anchor|synapomorphy}} An '''[[apomorphy]]''' ("separate form") or '''derived state''' is an innovation. It can thus be used to diagnose a clade – or even to help define a clade name in [[phylogenetic nomenclature]]. Features that are derived in individual taxa (a single species or a group that is represented by a single terminal in a given phylogenetic analysis) are called '''autapomorphies''' (from ''auto-'', "self"). Autapomorphies express nothing about relationships among groups; clades are identified (or defined) by '''synapomorphies''' (from ''syn-'', "together"). For example, the possession of [[Digit (anatomy)|digits]] that are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] with those of ''Homo sapiens'' is a synapomorphy within the vertebrates. The [[tetrapod]]s can be singled out as consisting of the first vertebrate with such digits homologous to those of ''Homo sapiens'' together with all descendants of this vertebrate (an apomorphy-based [[Phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetic definition]]).&lt;ref name="LaurinAnderson2004"&gt;{{Harvnb|Laurin|Anderson|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, snakes and other tetrapods that do not have digits are nonetheless tetrapods: other characters, such as amniotic eggs and diapsid skulls, indicate that they descended from ancestors that possessed digits which are homologous with ours.
* A character state is '''homoplastic''' or "an instance of '''[[homoplasy]]'''" if it is shared by two or more organisms but is absent from their common ancestor or from a later ancestor in the lineage leading to one of the organisms. It is therefore inferred to have evolved by convergence or reversal. Both mammals and birds are able to maintain a high constant body temperature (i.e., they are warm-blooded). However, the accepted cladogram explaining their significant features indicates that their common ancestor is in a group lacking this character state, so the state must have evolved independently in the two clades. Warm-bloodedness is separately a synapomorphy of mammals (or a larger clade) and of birds (or a larger clade), but it is not a synapomorphy of any group including both these clades. Hennig's Auxiliary Principle &lt;ref name="Hennig 1966"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hennig|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that shared character states should be considered evidence of grouping unless they are contradicted by the weight of other evidence; thus, homoplasy of some feature among members of a group may only be inferred after a phylogenetic hypothesis for that group has been established.

The terms plesiomorphy and apomorphy are relative; their application depends on the position of a group within a tree. For example, when trying to decide whether the tetrapods form a clade, an important question is whether having four limbs is a synapomorphy of the earliest taxa to be included within Tetrapoda: did all the earliest members of the Tetrapoda inherit four limbs from a common ancestor, whereas all other vertebrates did not, or at least not homologously? By contrast, for a group within the tetrapods, such as birds, having four limbs is a plesiomorphy. Using these two terms allows a greater precision in the discussion of homology, in particular allowing clear expression of the hierarchical relationships among different homologous features.

It can be difficult to decide whether a character state is in fact the same and thus can be classified as a synapomorphy, which may identify a monophyletic group, or whether it only appears to be the same and is thus a homoplasy, which cannot identify such a group. There is a danger of circular reasoning: assumptions about the shape of a phylogenetic tree are used to justify decisions about character states, which are then used as evidence for the shape of the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|James|Pourtless IV|2009|p=25}}: "Synapomorphies are invoked to defend the hypothesis; the hypothesis is invoked to defend the synapomorphies."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phylogenetics]] uses various forms of [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|parsimony]] to decide such questions; the conclusions reached often depend on the dataset and the methods. Such is the nature of empirical science, and for this reason, most cladists refer to their cladograms as hypotheses of relationship. Cladograms that are supported by a large number and variety of different kinds of characters are viewed as more robust than those based on more limited evidence.

== Terminology for taxa ==
Mono-, para- and polyphyletic taxa can be understood based on the shape of the tree (as done above), as well as based on their character states.&lt;ref name="Patterson 1988" /&gt;&lt;ref name="de Pinna 1991" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Patterson|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are compared in the table below.

{| class="wikitable"
|+
! Term
! Node-based definition
! Character-based definition
|- valign="top"
| [[Monophyly]]
| A [[clade]], a monophyletic taxon, is a taxon that includes all descendants of an inferred ancestor.
| A clade is characterized by one or more '''apomorphies''': derived character states present in the first member of the taxon, inherited by its descendants (unless secondarily lost), and not inherited by any other taxa.
|- valign="top"
| [[Paraphyly]]
| A paraphyletic assemblage is one that is constructed by taking a clade and removing one or more smaller clades.&lt;ref&gt;Many sources give a verbal definition of 'paraphyletic' that does not require the missing groups to be monophyletic. However, when diagrams are presented representing paraphyletic groups, these invariably show the missing groups as monophyletic. See e.g.{{Harvnb|Wiley|Siegel-Causey|Brooks|Funk|1991|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Removing one clade produces a singly paraphyletic assemblage, removing two produces a doubly paraphylectic assemblage, and so on.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Taylor|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
| A paraphyletic assemblage is characterized by one or more '''plesiomorphies''': character states inherited from ancestors but not present in all of their descendants. As a consequence, a paraphyletic assemblage is truncated, in that it excludes one or more clades from an otherwise monophyletic taxon. An alternative name is ''[[evolutionary grade]]'', referring to an ancestral character state within the group. While paraphyletic assemblages are popular among paleontologists and evolutionary taxonomists, cladists do not recognize paraphyletic assemblages as having any formal information content – they are merely parts of clades.
|- valign="top"
| [[Polyphyly]]
| A polyphyletic assemblage is one which is neither monophyletic nor paraphyletic.
| A polyphyletic assemblage is characterized by one or more '''[[Homoplasy|homoplasies]]''': character states which have converged or reverted so as to be the same but which have not been inherited from a common ancestor. No systematist recognizes polyphyletic assemblages as taxonomically meaningful entities, although ecologists sometimes consider them meaningful labels for functional participants in ecological communities (e. g., primary producers, detritivores, etc.).

== Criticism ==

Cladistics, either generally or in specific applications, has been criticized from its beginnings. Decisions as to whether particular character states are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]], a precondition of their being synapomorphies, have been challenged as involving [[circular reasoning]] and subjective judgements.&lt;ref name="AdraEdgeLieb02"&gt;{{Harvnb|Adrain|Edgecombe|Lieberman|2002|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transformed cladistics]] arose in the late 1970s in an attempt to resolve some of these problems by removing phylogeny from cladistic analysis, but it has remained unpopular.

However, homology is usually determined from analysis of the results that are evaluated with homology measures, mainly the consistency index (CI) and retention index (RI), which, it has been claimed,{{by whom|date=October 2013}} makes the process objective. Also, homology can be equated to synapomorphy, which is what Patterson has done.&lt;ref&gt;Forey, Peter et al. 1992. Cladistics,1st ed., p. 9, Oxford U. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In disciplines other than biology ==
The comparisons used to acquire data on which [[cladograms]] can be based are not limited to the field of biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mace|Clare|Shennan|2005|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any group of individuals or classes that are hypothesized to have a common ancestor, and to which a set of common characteristics may or may not apply, can be compared pairwise. Cladograms can be used to depict the hypothetical descent relationships within groups of items in many different academic realms. The only requirement is that the items have characteristics that can be identified and measured.

[[Cultural anthropology|Anthropology]] and [[archaeology]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lipo|O'Brien|Collard|Shennan|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cladistic methods have been used to reconstruct the development of cultures or artifacts using groups of cultural traits or artifact features.

[[Comparative mythology]] and [[Folklore|folktale]] use cladistic methods to reconstruct the protoversion of many myths. Mythological phylogenies constructed with mythemes clearly support low horizontal transmissions (borrowings), historical (sometimes Palaeolithic) diffusions and punctuated evolution.&lt;ref&gt;d'Huy 2012a, b; d'Huy 2013a, b, c, d&lt;/ref&gt; They also are a powerful way to test hypotheses about cross-cultural relationships among folktales.&lt;ref&gt;Ross and al. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tehrani 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Literature]]: Cladistic methods have been used in the classification of the surviving manuscripts of the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Canterbury Tales Project |url=http://www.canterburytalesproject.org |accessdate=2009-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707103441/http://www.canterburytalesproject.org/ |archivedate=7 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the manuscripts of the Sanskrit ''[[Charaka Samhita]]''.&lt;ref name="Maas 2010"&gt;{{Harvnb|Maas|2010–2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Historical linguistics]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Oppenheimer|2006|pp=290–300, 340–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cladistic methods have been used to reconstruct the phylogeny of languages using linguistic features. This is similar to the traditional [[comparative method (linguistics)|comparative method]] of historical linguistics, but is more explicit in its use of [[Occam's razor|parsimony]] and allows much faster analysis of large datasets ([[computational phylogenetics]]).

[[Textual criticism]] or [[stemmatics]]:&lt;ref name="Maas 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Robinson|O’Hara|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cladistic methods have been used to reconstruct the phylogeny of manuscripts of the same work (and reconstruct the lost original) using distinctive copying errors as apomorphies. This differs from traditional historical-comparative linguistics in enabling the editor to evaluate and place in genetic relationship large groups of manuscripts with large numbers of variants that would be impossible to handle manually. It also enables [[Maximum parsimony (phylogenetics)|parsimony]] analysis of contaminated traditions of transmission that would be impossible to evaluate manually in a reasonable period of time.

[[Astrophysics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Fraix-Burnet|Choler|Douzery|Verhamme|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; infers the history of relationships between galaxies to create branching diagram hypotheses of galaxy diversification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12542">'''Contextual design''' ('''CD''') is a [[user-centered design]] process developed by Hugh Beyer and [[Karen Holtzblatt]]. It incorporates [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] methods for gathering data relevant to the product via field studies, rationalizing [[workflow]]s, and designing [[human-computer interface]]s. In practice, this means that researchers aggregate data from customers in the field where people are living and applying these findings into a final product.&lt;ref name="primary"&gt;Beyer, H. &amp; Holtzblatt, K. (1998). Contextual Design: Defining Customer-Centered Systems. San Francisco: Morgan Kaufmann. {{ISBN|1-55860-411-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contextual design can be seen as an alternative to engineering and feature driven models of creating new systems.

==Process overview==

The contextual design process consists of the following top-level steps: contextual inquiry, interpretation, data consolidation, visioning, storyboarding, user environment design, and prototyping.

===Collecting data – contextual inquiry===
{{main|Contextual inquiry}}
Contextual inquiry is a field data collection technique used to capture detailed information about how users of a product interact with the product in their normal work environment. This information is captured by both observations of user behavior and conversations with the user while she or he works. A key aspect of the technique is to partner with the user, letting their work and the issues they encounter guide the interview. Key takeaways from the technique are to learn what users actually do, why they do it that way, latent needs, desires, and core values.&lt;ref name="primary"/&gt;

===Interpretation===

[[Image:Flow model.gif|thumb|Simplified flow model]]

Data from each interview is analyzed and key issues and insights are captured. Detailed work models are also created in order to understand the different aspects of the work that matter for design. Contextual design consists of five work models which are used to model the work tasks and details of the working environment. These work models are:&lt;ref name="secondary"&gt;Holtzblatt, K: Contextual Design: Experience in Real Life. Mensch  &amp; Computer 2001. (online {{cite web |url=http://mc.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/konferenzbaende/mc2001/Holtzblatt.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050816180340/http://mc.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/konferenzbaende/mc2001/Holtzblatt.pdf |archivedate=2005-08-16 |df= }})&lt;/ref&gt;

* Flow model – represents the coordination, communication, interaction, roles, and responsibilities of the people in a certain work practice
* Sequence model – represents the steps users go through to accomplish a certain activity, including breakdowns
* Cultural model – represents the norms, influences, and pressures that are present in the work environment
* Artifact model – represents the documents or other physical things that are created while working or are used to support the work. Artifacts often have a structure or styling that could represent the user's way of structuring the work
* Physical model – represents the physical environment where the work tasks are accomplished; often, there are multiple physical models representing, e.g., office layout, network topology, or the layout of tools on a computer display.

===Data consolidation===

[[Image:Affinity wall.png|thumb|Part of an affinity diagram]]

Data from individual customer interviews are analyzed in order to reveal patterns and the structure across distinct interviews. Models of the same type can be consolidated together (but not generalized—detail must be maintained). Another method of processing the observations is making an affinity diagram ("wall"), as described by Beyer &amp; Holtzblatt:&lt;ref name="primary"/&gt;

* A single observation is written on each piece of paper.
* Individual notes are grouped according to the similarity of their contents.
* These groups are labeled with colored Post-it notes, each color representing a distinct level in the hierarchy.
* Then the groups are combined with other groups to get the final construct of observations in a hierarchy of up to three levels.

Beyer &amp; Holtzblatt propose the following color-coding convention for grouping the notes, from lowest to highest level in the hierarchy:&lt;ref name="primary"/&gt;

* White notes &amp;ndash; individual notes captured during interpretation, also known as "affinity notes" 
* Blue notes &amp;ndash; summaries of groups of white notes that convey all the relevant details
* Pink notes &amp;ndash; summaries of groups of blue notes that reveal key issues in the data
* Green notes &amp;ndash; labels identifying an area of concern indicated by pink notes

Beyer &amp; Holtzblatt emphasize the importance of building the entire affinity diagram in one or two sessions rather than building smaller affinity diagrams over many sessions. This immersion in the data for an extended period of time helps teams see the broad scope of a problem quickly and encourages a paradigm shift of thought rather than assimilation of ideas.&lt;ref name="primary"/&gt;

The design ideas and relevant issues that arise during the process should be included in the affinity diagram. Any holes in the data and areas that need more information should also be labeled. After completing the wall, participants "walk" the affinity diagram to stimulate new ideas and identify any remaining issues or holes in data. The affinity diagram is a bottom-up method. Consolidated data may also be used to create a [[cause-and-effect diagram]] or a set of [[Persona (marketing)|personas]] describing typical users of the proposed system.

===Visioning===

In visioning, a cross-functional team comes together to create stories of how new product concepts, services, and technology can better support the user work practice. The visioning team starts by reviewing the data to identify key issues and opportunities. The data walking session is followed by a group visioning session during which the visioning team generates a variety of new product concepts by telling stories of different usage scenarios based on the data collected. A vision includes the system, its delivery, and support structures to make the new work practice successful, but is told from the user's point of view.

===Storyboarding===

After visioning, the team develops the vision in [[storyboards]], capturing scenarios of how people will work with the new system. Understanding the current way of working, its structure and the complete [[workflow]] helps the design team address the problems and design the new workflow. Storyboards work out the details of the vision, guided by the consolidated data, using pictures and text in a series of hand-drawn cells.

===User Environment Design===

The User Environment Design captures the floor plan of the new system. It shows each part of the system, how it supports the user's work, exactly what function is available in that part, and how the user gets to and from other parts of the system. Contextual design uses the User Environment Design (UED) diagram, which displays the focus areas, i.e., areas which are visible to the user or which are relevant to the user. Focus areas can be defined further as functions in a system that support a certain type or part of the work. The UED also presents how the focus areas relate to each other and shows the links between focus areas.&lt;ref name="primary"/&gt;

===Prototyping===

Testing the design ideas with [[paper prototypes]] or even with more sophisticated interactive prototypes before the implementation phase helps the designers communicate with users about the new system and develop the design further. Prototypes test the structure of a User Environment Design and initial user interface ideas, as well as the understanding of the work, before the implementation phase.&lt;ref name="secondary"/&gt; Depending on the results of the prototype test, more iterations or alternative designs may be needed.

==Uses and adaptations==

Contextual design has primarily been used for the design of computer information systems, including hardware,&lt;ref&gt;Curtis, P., Heiserman, T., Jobusch, D., Notess, M., &amp; Webb, J. (1999). Customer-focused design data in a large, multi-site organization. In Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems: the CHI Is the Limit (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, May 15–20, 1999). CHI '99.

Customer connection creates a winning product: building success with contextual techniques. interactions 6, 1 (Jan. 1999), pp. 50-57.&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of contextual design have been adapted for use as a [[usability]] evaluation method&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, S., Monahan, K., and Cockton, G. 2006. Modified contextual design as a field evaluation method. In Proceedings of the 4th Nordic Conference on Human-Computer interaction: Changing Roles (Oslo, Norway, October 14–18, 2006). A. Mørch, K. Morgan, T. Bratteteig, G. Ghosh, and D. Svanaes, Eds. NordiCHI '06, vol. 189. ACM Press, New York, NY, 437-440.&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[contextual application design]]. Contextual design has also been applied to the design of digital libraries and other learning technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Notess, M. 2005. "[http://www.dlib.org/dlib/july05/khoo/07_notess.pdf Using Contextual Design for Digital Library Field Studies.]" Position paper presented at the JCDL 2005 workshop, "Studying Digital Library Users In the Wild: Theories, Methods, and Analytical Approaches" in Denver, June 10–11.

"Applying Contextual Design to Educational Software Development." In ''Instructional Design in the Real World: A View from the Trenches'', Anne-Marie Armstrong, ed. Hershey, PA: Idea Group Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contextual design has also been used as a means of teaching [[user-centered design]]/[[Human–computer interaction]] at the university level.&lt;ref&gt;Lárusdóttir, M. K. "Using Rapid Contextual Design at Reykjavik University", accepted paper for the workshop named "HCIEd.2006-1 inventivity: Teaching theory, design and innovation in HCI" held by British Computer Society HCI Group (BHCIG), the International Federation of Information Processing (IFIP) WG13.1 Education, and the Irish Computer Society" in Limrick in Ireland, 23–24 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weinberg, J. B. and Stephen, M. L. 2002. [[Participatory design]] in a human-computer interaction course: teaching ethnography methods to computer scientists.

A more lightweight approach to contextual design has been developed by its originators to address an oft-heard criticism that the method is too labor-intensive or lengthy for some needs.&lt;ref&gt;Holtzblatt, K., Wendell, J.B., &amp; Wood, S. 2005. Rapid Contextual Design: A How-to guide to key techniques for user-centered design. San Francisco: Morgan-Kaufmann.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet others find the designer/user engagement promoted by contextual design to be too brief.&lt;ref&gt;Hartswood, M., Procter, R., Slack, R., Soutter, J., Voß, A., and Rouncefield, M. 2002. The benefits of a long engagement: from contextual design to the co-realisation of work affording artefacts.

'''Cornwall Archaeological Society''' is an amateur archaeological society based in [[Cornwall]], [[United Kingdom]] for the study of [[archaeology]] in Cornwall and the [[Isles of Scilly]]. It was founded in 1961 by members of the West Cornwall Field Club.&lt;ref name="cas"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://cornisharchaeology.org.uk/about-us/history/|website=Cornwall Archaeological Society|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===West Cornwall Field Club===
The West Cornwall Field Club was founded by [[Lt Col]] F C Hirst and six of the volunteers who were excavating a site at [[Porthmeor]], in the [[Zennor|parish of Zennor]] from 1933 to 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Porthmeor|url=http://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=423591|website=Pastscape|publisher=Historic England|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Membership increased to nineteen in 1937 and averaged fifty in the 1950s. Between 1953 and 1961 the club produced twenty-seven publications including six field guides and an annual journal, and the club members took part in forty excavations. During the fifties many members lived in mid and east Cornwall and the field club was publishing increasingly more articles from those areas. It was felt that the name no longer relevant to the scope of the field club and at the [[annual general meeting]] on 10 August 1961 it was unanimously approved to change the title to Cornwall Archaeological Society.&lt;ref name=v1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=A C|title=Editorial|journal=Cornish Archaeology|volume=1|pages=1–4|url=http://cornisharchaeology.org.uk/volume-1-1962/|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cornwall Archaeological Society===
The first President of the society was [[Ralegh Radford|C A Ralegh Radford]] an English archaeologist and historian who specialised in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]].&lt;ref name=v1/&gt;

==Excavations==
The Society has organised a number of excavations. One, considered to be outstanding was at [[Carn Brea, Redruth|Carn Brea]] led by [[Roger Mercer]] from 1970 to 1973, which established a new class of site — the [[Neolithic Europe|Early Neolithic]] [[tor enclosure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carn Brea, Early Neolithic tor enclosure, c 3700 BC|url=http://www.royalarchinst.org/jubilee/cas|website=Royal Archaeology Society|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1963 [[The Rumps]]
* 1964 [[Carn Euny]]

==Publications==
The Society publishes a journal ''Cornish Archaeology Hendhyscans Kernow'' in most years. The first was published in 1962 and the latest, number 54, was published in 2015. A newsletter is published three times a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newsletter|url=http://www.cornisharchaeology.org.uk/newsletter.htm|website=Cornwall Archaeological Society|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminology and penology |theory}}

'''Criminalization''' or '''criminalisation''', in [[criminology]], is "the process by which behaviors and individuals are transformed into [[crime]] and criminals".&lt;ref&gt;Michalowski p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously legal acts may be transformed into crimes by [[legislation]] or judicial decision. However, there is usually a formal presumption in the rules of [[statutory interpretation]] against the [[Ex post facto law|retrospective application of laws]] and only the use of express words by the legislature may rebut this presumption. The power of judges to make new law and retrospectively criminalise behaviour is also discouraged. In a less overt way, where laws have not been strictly enforced, the acts prohibited by those laws may also undergo ''de facto'' criminalization through more effective or committed legal enforcement.

==The problems==
There has been some uncertainty as to the nature and extent of the contribution to be made by the victims of crime. But, as Garkawe (2001) indicates, the relationship between [[victimology]] and [[criminology]] has become problematic. The concern is that, within the [[dialectic]] of [[Right Realism]] and [[Left realism|Left Realism]],&lt;ref&gt;Walklate (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; a focus on the victim promotes rights selectively for certain victims, and advocates the assumption that some victim rights are more important than competing rights or values in society.&lt;ref&gt;Elias (1993).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an [[Islamic]] [[feminism|feminist]] might seek consistency of treatment for women as victims and, therefore, demand the decriminalization of abortion, adultery, and seduction ([[Zina]] is a [[Hudud]] offense in [[sharia|sharia law]]), and the criminalization of [[domestic violence]] and [[sexual harassment]].

In formal academically published theory, the real ruling class of a society reaches a temporary view on whether certain acts or behavior are harmful or criminal. Historically this one theory will be modified by scientific, medical evidence, by political change, and the criminal justice system may or may not treat those matters as crimes.

Conversely, when local politics determines that it is no longer a crime, they may be decriminalized. For example, Recommendation No. R (95) 12 adopted by the [[Council of Europe Committee of Ministers|Committee of Ministers]] of the Council of Europe on the management of criminal justice, advocates that crime policies such as decriminalization, depenalisation or diversion, and mediation should be adopted wherever possible. But the law and order debate between right and left politicians is often superficial and unscientific, formulating policies based on their appeal to an uniformed electorate rather than properly conducted research.&lt;ref&gt;Currie (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
Several principles may underpin decisions about criminalization. These include the ''[[de minimis]]'' principle, that of the minimum criminalization.&lt;ref name="ashworth67"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Under this principle, the general harm principle fails to consider the possibility of other sanctions and the effectiveness of criminalization as a chosen option. Those other sanctions include civil courts, laws of [[tort]] and [[regulation]]. Having criminal remedies in place is seen as a "last resort" since such actions often infringe personal liberties &amp;ndash; [[incarceration]], for example, prevents the freedom of movement. In this sense, law making that places a greater emphasis on human rights. Most crimes of direct actions ([[murder]], [[rape]], [[assault]], for example) are generally not affected by such a stance, but it does require greater justification in less clear cases.&lt;ref name="ashworth67"/&gt;

The policy of "social defense" can be seen as an opposing view. It argues that criminalization is used against "any form of activity which threatens good order or is thought reprehensible". The minimization principle may unwittingly prevent the adaptation of the law to new situations.&lt;ref name="ashworth67"/&gt; In general, worldwide policy makers have created a myriad of smaller offences, in contradiction to the minimization principle and more in keeping with the [[social defence]].&lt;ref name="ashworth68"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harm===
{{see also|Victimless crimes}}
Leading criminal law philosophers, such as Dennis Baker and Joel Feinberg have argued that conduct should only be criminalized when it is fair to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis J. Baker, The Right Not to be Criminalized: Demarcating Criminal Law's Authority (Ashgate 2011) at chapter 3; Dennis J. Baker Dennis, "The Moral Limits of Criminalizing Remote Harms", (2007) 11(3) New Criminal Law Review 371, Joel Feinberg, Harm to Others: The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law, OUP, 1984: New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, such theorists assert that objective reasons are needed to demonstrate that it is fair to criminalize conduct in any given case. The commonly cited objective justification for invoking the criminal law is harm to others, but it cannot deal with all situations. For example, people are not necessarily harmed by public nudity. Feinberg suggests that offence to others also provides an objective reason for invoking the criminal law, but it clearly does not as offence is determined according to conventional morality. Prostitution is another grey area, as some countries allow it in different forms, and it is hard to say whether or not it specifically harms the public in general.  One argument may be that prostitution perpetuates the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, and therefore harms the public which partakes in the act of prostitution.  However, the legalization of prostitution would change the way it is regulated, and law enforcement could find a way to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted disease, thus eliminating the health issue and the question of the morality of the profession would be weakened.

People experience a range of physical and social injuries in different contexts which will vary according to the level of economic and political development of their country. Some will be injured out of [[poverty]] and [[malnutrition]], others by [[violence]] which might stem from a major conflict such as [[war]] or from the personal violence in a [[robbery]]. The [[natural environment|environment]] may be damaged by [[pollution]], there may be hazards at work. Many of these sources of injury will be ignored while the state may delegate powers of control to a number of different agencies within an international framework where [[supranationalism|supranational]] agencies and [[human rights]] organisations may offer assistance in responding to the causes of those injuries.

===Moral approaches and autonomy===
The extent to which behaviours considered [[morally wrong]] in a given jurisdiction should be criminalized is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 42&amp;ndash;43.&lt;/ref&gt; Lying or breaking promises are not in general criminalised, for example. [[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Patrick Devlin]] believed that moral behaviour was essential in maintaining the cohesion of a state, and so lawmakers should be entitled to criminalise immoral behaviour.&lt;ref name="ashworth43"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; However, opponents of this approach typically suggest use of a harm principle only and that immorality is not a reason in itself since outcomes of such activity can be used to come to a conclusion alone. Devlin's argument uses the disgust of the general public as a definition of morality; however, issues involving [[prejudice]] have shown this to be flawed and opponents push for a much stricter definition if this approach is to be used.&lt;ref name="ashworth43"/&gt; Devlin suggested a jury to give an indication of immoral behaviour. As well as prejudice, views were likely to vary widely on issues such as [[homosexuality]], [[contraception]] and other matters, particularly those influenced by religion. Agreement would be hard to find.&lt;ref name="ashworth43"/&gt; Other opposition has been from liberal groups which favour approaches which maximise individual rights.&lt;ref name="ashworth44"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; A moral basis for criminalization would be [[paternalistic]], thereby contrasting with personal autonomy. The [[European Convention of Human Rights]], in the most part supporting individual rights from government interferences, still includes a provision for interference "for the protection of health and morals"&lt;ref name="ashworth44"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://conventions.coe.int/treaty/en/Treaties/Html/005.htm |title=Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms Measures |publisher=[[Council of Europe]] |year=2010 |accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as legally requiring [[seat belt]]s to be worn (in some jurisdictions) are hard to justify if an individualistic approach is taken, since, if public health provision is ignored, little harm is caused to others.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 44&amp;ndash;45.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Raz]] argues that the state cannot and should not enforce morality; rather, any attempt to limit individual autonomy should be done only to limit harm. Certain moral ideals may be justifiable if they extend autonomy. If the immoral conduct of others impinges on someone else's autonomy, then that can be legislated against.&lt;ref name="ashworth45"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; There are some groups for whom the principle of autonomy is weakened: those under an [[age of majority]] and those people who are impaired by, for example, a [[mental disorder]].&lt;ref name="ashworth45"/&gt; In general, these people are protected from activities with significant consequences, if they are not in a position to make reasoned decisions themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 45&amp;ndash;46.&lt;/ref&gt; This may involve the criminalization of [[under-age drinking]], [[smoking]], [[gambling]] and [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]]. Such criminalization is rarely challenged.&lt;ref name="ashworth45"/&gt;

In [[British law]], a distinction between public and private acts was made in the [[Wolfenden report]], which examined sexual activities (particularly homosexuality and [[prostitution]]). Some acts would effectively become legal within private settings, but illegal in public settings.&lt;ref name="ashworth46"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The justification for this was the concept of shock or offensive to the public. Such a line was favoured by [[Joel Feinberg]], who argued that it was a good reason in support of legislation if it effectively prevented "serious offence" to persons other than the [[actor (law)|actor]].&lt;ref name="ashworth46"/&gt; Philosophers such as Feinberg struggle to quantify the ideology behind the illegality of acts which in another setting would be acceptable (that acts themselves not causing harm, for example), for example [[nudity]]. Since such acts publicly are made illegal on the basis of shock, then whether to criminalise depends on a shifting body of public opinion, which varies from place to place and from time to time. The concept of "insult" rather than "offensive" may be more specific.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 46&amp;ndash;47.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Omission===
{{main|Omission (criminal law)}}
[[Common law]] does not often find an actor liable for omission &amp;ndash; failing to do something required by the law. Where this has applied it has typically been in industrial [[regulation]], in matters of [[social security]] or some personal regulated activity such as driving (for example, in the case of a [[hit and run (vehicular)|hit and run]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 47&amp;ndash;48.&lt;/ref&gt; These form conditions placed upon operating in a particular manner and are thus understood in that context. There are few general duties in common law jurisdictions, although these do include the responsibility of a parent to safeguard their children, to a landowner to prevent offences being carried out there, and to someone creating a dangerous situation to attempt to limit that danger.&lt;ref name="ashworth48"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of limited liability for omissions suggest that the wording for such a law would be vague, possibly involving "reasonable" care or action, and so would be hard to enforce. This would give prosecutors wide discretion, which may be opposed to justice.&lt;ref name="ashworth48"/&gt; Morally, omission is viewed by many as a far lesser problem than act; compared to murder, allowing someone to die is seen as much smaller.&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 48&amp;ndash;49.&lt;/ref&gt; A requirement to spend one's time and energy helping others would seem to contradict the autonomy many other laws aim to provide the individual with.&lt;ref name="ashworth49"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents point out these arguments fail to consider the harm that such omissions may cause, in contradiction to the harm principle many legal systems start out with. Life and physical integrity are often the highest priorities of a legal system.&lt;ref name="ashworth49"/&gt; Difficulties in definition are in common with many other areas, theorists such as Feinburg point out. A non-burdensome rescue is likely to be less valuable than freedom of action.&lt;ref name="ashworth49"/&gt; Limited liability is considered as article 223 of the [[French Penal Code]], which criminalises: "(1) a person who voluntarily neglects to prevent a serious crime of offense against that person, if that crime could be prevented without personal risk or risk to others; and (2) a person who voluntarily neglects to give, to a person in peril,  assistance which could be rendered without personal risk or risk to others."&lt;ref&gt;Ashworth (1999). pp. 49&amp;ndash;50.&lt;/ref&gt; This is common with several other European jurisdictions. Whilst open to the criticisms of vagueness and prosecutor discretion, it has not been seen as overly oppressive.&lt;ref name="ashworth50"&gt;Ashworth (1999). p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Procedure===
When a state debates whether to respond to a source of injury by criminalising the behaviour that produces it, there are no pre-set criteria to apply in formulating social policy. There is no ontological reality to crime. The criminal justice system responds to a substantial number of events that do not produce significant hardship to individual citizens. Moreover, events which do cause serious injuries and perhaps should be dealt with as crimes, e.g. situations of [[corporate manslaughter]], are either ignored or dealt with as civil matters.

The criminalization process defines and classifies behaviour. It broadcasts the laws so that no-one may have the [[excuse]] of [[ignorantia juris non excusat|ignorance]], and disposes of those who will not obey. There are now more criminal laws and they are penetrating deeper into the social structures of modern societies. Crime control has become an industry, yet it remains ineffective in providing protection to all its citizens from harm. Such as it is, the process is made up of three components:
#Creation of a social order. This is both a socio-economic process, a "...fundamental ordering of social relations so that those things necessary for social survival can be produced and distributed in some predictable fashion" and an ideological process so that there can be a "...development of values, beliefs, and ideas related to the concrete tasks of production and distribution."(p.&amp;nbsp;6). Thus, society must develop the apparatus of law creation, law enforcement and [[punishment]] and the system must be acceptable to the majority of those who live in the community. If the laws do not match the general [[mores]], their enforcement will be a source of friction and disharmony. Conformity to the social order must, for the most part, be self-enforced.
#For the times when self-enforcement fails, society must create a legal order. This part of the process sees the centralisation of power within the institutions of the political state.  Some states justified the criminalization process as demonstrating their concerns about safety and security, the policy of control, policing, criminal justice, and penal practice. The modern state is [[decentralisation|decentralising]] and [[privatisation|privatising]] its functions. This is changing the character and content of the remaining institutions of the state which must now work co-operatively with other for-profit agencies.
#The political order must realign so that the remaining political entities such as [[legislature]]s and [[judge]]s set agreed targets for state control and then produce actual outputs of the legal order, i.e. of people defined as criminal and processed through that system.

==Ontological basis of crime==

Put in the most simple terms, ontology deals with or establishes the clear grounds for being. (Heidegger, Martin, Being and Time, introduction, referencing Plato's Parmenides.) In some of the traditional schools, such as those of the post-1688 English or Americans (many of the writings of the American Founding Fathers, but especially The Federalist) and their Dutch predecessors (see Kossmann, E. H. Political Thought in the Dutch Republic, 2004) ontology proper is deemed beyond the scope of legal thought, in accord with the modern distinction between society and state (which some consider based in the distinction the Romans made between themselves and their Italian allies, the socii, but not given the theoretical articulation we recognize today until emphasized by Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan. See [[State (polity)|state]].) However, some classical theorists, such as Aristotle, in his Politics and Metaphysics, and to a lesser degree in his Topics,{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} suggest that the distinction is at least problematic. One need consider no further than the claim that man is a political animal to see this is so.

As a political animal, man has come to see himself as possessed of rights,&lt;ref&gt;UN Human Rights Council, http://www.ohchr.org/english/bodies/hrcouncil/&lt;/ref&gt; whether these are the [[Rights of Englishmen]] of old, or the universal human rights advocated vigorously toward establishment today through the matrix of commercialism.&lt;ref&gt;International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/a_cescr.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; At least in the today dominant American model, deprivation of right amounts to injury (consider especially Justice Stevens dissenting opinion in [[Castle Rock v. Gonzales]]), and injury—so goes the prevailing theory—amounts, when coupled with requisite intent, in most cases, to crime, when it does not admit of civil redress. Thus, again in simple terms, and to the extent that human beings are indeed political beings, crime does seem to have an ontological basis. (For one approach to the question of criminal ontology, see "Understanding Crime and Social Control in Market Economies: Looking Back and Moving Forward" by Robert Bohm in Jeffrey Ian Ross, ed. Cutting the Edge: Current Perspectives in Radical/Critical Criminology and Criminal Justice. Westport, Conn: Praeger, 1998.) This, further, seems to hold if ontology itself is divided into political and trans- or supra- or meta- political ontology—i.e., what once was the realm of Christian theology. Of course, it does not matter whether that theology is Christian or belonging to some other apolitical belief. The point is that one may, with some justice, argue persuasively that being is divided. This need not, however, force the question of meta-political crimes. Our purposes here, in this article, are limited to the political. For the question in general see [[Ontology]].

Baker  argues that only objective harms and other objective bad consequences (or actions in the case of inchoate and endangerment offenses) are prima facie criminalizable. By other bad consequences Baker means privacy violations and conduct that does not necessarily result in tangible harm, but does result in unwanted consequences. Baker argues that the privacy violations that result from being forced to receive unwanted obscene information in public places (exhibitionism) would amount to a sufficient bad consequence for the purposes of invoking the criminal law,  but argues that proportionate punishment means that such conduct should only be punished with fines rather than jail terms.

[[Image:DIboxweb.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A high-quality, expensive passive DI box. It is "passive" because it does not need battery power or external power to operate. DI boxes which require a battery or external power (e.g., [[phantom power]]) are called "active" DI boxes]]
A '''DI unit''' (direct input) is an electronic device typically used in [[recording studio]]s and in [[sound reinforcement system]]s to connect a high-[[output impedance]], [[line level]], unbalanced output signal to a low-impedance, microphone level, [[Balanced audio|balanced]] input, usually via an [[XLR connector]] and XLR cable. DIs are frequently used to connect an [[electric guitar]] or [[bass guitar|electric bass]] to a [[mixing console]]'s microphone input jack. The DI performs level matching, balancing, and either active [[buffer amplifier|buffering]] or passive [[impedance matching]]/[[impedance bridging]] to minimize unwanted noise, distortion, and [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loops]]. DI units are typically metal boxes with input and output jacks and, for more expensive units, “ground lift” and attenuator switches.

DI boxes are extensively used with professional and semi-professional [[PA system]]s, professional [[sound reinforcement system]]s and in [[sound recording]] studios. Manufacturers produce a wide range of units, from inexpensive, basic, passive units to expensive, sophisticated, active units. DI boxes may provide numerous features and user-controllable options (e.g., a user-selectable 0dB, 20dB or 40dB pad and/or a "[[ground lift]]" switch). They may come in different types of enclosures, usually a metal chassis that helps to protect against electrical interference.  Some [[bass amplifier]]s have built-in DI units, so that the bass amp's output signal can be connected directly to a mixing board in a sound reinforcement/live show or recording context.

==Terminology==
DI units are also referred to as a '''DI box''', '''direct box''', or simply '''DI''', with each letter pronounced, as in "Dee Eye." The term is variously claimed to stand for ''direct input'', ''direct injection'', ''direct induction'' or ''direct interface''.

==History==
[[Image:WolfBox2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A vintage Wolfbox custom-made by audio engineer Ed Wolfrum in the 1960s.]]
Passive direct boxes first appeared in the United States in the middle 1960s, most notably in Detroit at radio stations and recording studios like "[[Motown]]", "[[United Sound Systems]]", "[[Golden World Records]]", Tera Shirma Studios and the Metro-Audio Capstan Roller remote recording truck. These DIs were custom made by engineers like Ed Wolfrum with his "[[Wolfbox]]" and by concert sound companies to solve certain problems associated with amplifying electric musical instruments, especially [[electric guitar]]s. These boxes typically contained an [[audio transformer]] (like the Triad A11J through 1974) with a turns ratio from approximately 8:1 to 12:1, and thus an impedance ratio of around 144:1. With this kind of transformer, the output voltage of the instrument is stepped down to a range compatible with the typical [[mixing console]]'s [[microphone preamp]]. The typical console preamp input impedance of 1,500 ohms would appear to the electronic instrument as a high input impedance of 216,000 ohms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Audio Transformers |last=Whitlock |first=Bill |editor=Glen Ballou |title=Handbook for Sound Engineers |edition=3 |year=2001 }} Section 2.2.3: Line to Microphone Input or 'Direct Box'.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The passive direct box was suitable for most electronic musical instruments but it negatively colored the sound of ones with weaker output signals, such as Fender [[Rhodes piano]]s and [[Fender Precision Bass]]es with single-coil pickups. To accommodate these instruments, active direct boxes were designed containing powered electronic circuitry which increased the input impedance from about 200,000 to above 1,000,000 ohms. In 1975, a 48-volt [[phantom power]]ed active direct box was designed for [[Leon Russell]]'s recording studio, its circuitry published in ''dB'', the sound engineering magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=dB |volume=9 |title=A Remote Powered Direct Box }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sound company [[Tycobrahe]], known for supporting large rock festivals such as [[California Jam]], offered an active direct box for sale in 1977, a model capable of +9&amp;nbsp;dBm line level output, with a built-in attenuator to compensate for various input levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=DB: The Sound Engineering Magazine |volume=111 |year=1977 |title=Advertisement}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |page=117 |work=High Fidelity |title=Equipment Reports |volume=27 |year=1977 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
The direct box takes a high impedance, unbalanced signal and converts it to a low impedance, balanced signal. This allows the signal to be sent over long cable runs with significantly less signal loss (especially in high frequencies) due to the lowering of the impedance, and greater rejection of interference due to the benefit of common mode rejection in a balanced signal.  Furthermore, the lower impedance (around 600 ohms is normal) allows an insignificant load to the input of a mixing console or preamp which is also designed to accept input from low impedance microphones.

Because all cables used in live sound and recording are "capacitive", long cables used without a DI box can become a "[[low‑pass filter]]" which reduces the high end frequencies.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/q-why-do-i-need-use-di-box&lt;/ref&gt; Using a DI box provides a balanced cable, which reduces radio frequency noise and electromagnetic problems coming from lighting systems.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/q-why-do-i-need-use-di-box&lt;/ref&gt; Mic cables are typically [[balanced cable|balanced]] XLR cables; on the other hand, the output from an electric bass or electric guitar is usually a 1/4" unbalanced cable.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/q-why-do-i-need-use-di-box&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage of DI units is that the DI contains a "...balancing transformer" that reduces "ground‑loop problems and potential electrical safety issues under fault conditions".&lt;ref&gt; http://www.soundonsound.com/sound-advice/q-why-do-i-need-use-di-box&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passive units==
[[Image:passivedi.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A very simple, inexpensive passive DI]]

[[Image:Radial JDI Mk 3.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A passive DI with "throughput" in addition to XLR output]]
A [[Passive component|passive]] DI unit typically consists of an audio [[transformer]] used as a [[balun]].  The term "passive" indicates that the unit does not require a battery or other power source to operate. This makes passive DIs less expensive, but it also means that they cannot include preamplifier features which enable the user to boost the gain. The turns ratio on a passive DI is typically chosen to convert a [[nominal impedance|nominal]] 50 kΩ signal source (such as the magnetic pickup of an electric guitar or electric bass) to the 100–200 Ω expected by the mic input of an [[audio mixer]]. Typical turns ratios are in the range of 10:1 to 20:1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=11561 AES E-Library: ''Interfacing Electronics and Transformers'' by Finnern, Thomas]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://emusician.com/mag/emusic_going_direct/ Electronic Musician, Nov 1, 2001. Scott Wilkinson. ''Going Direct'']&lt;/ref&gt; Less commonly, a passive DI unit may consist of a [[resistor|resistive]] load, with or without [[capacitor]] coupling. Such units are best suited to outputs designed for [[headphone]]s or [[loudspeaker]]s.

The less expensive passive DI units are more susceptible to hum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.prosoundweb.com/index.php/topic,78474.msg715164.html#msg715164 ProSoundWeb Community. ''Cheepie DI's'' response by Andy Peters]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.prosoundweb.com/index.php/topic,76753.msg699354.html#msg699354 ProSoundWeb Community. ''Behringer Ultra DI-120'' response by Andy Peters]&lt;/ref&gt; and passive units tend to be less versatile than active. However, they require no batteries, are simpler to use, and the better units are extremely reliable when used as designed. The lack of batteries in passive DIs means that users do not have to worry about batteries losing their power in the middle of a live show or recording session.

Some models have no settings or switches, while others can have a [[ground lift]] switch (to avoid [[Ground loop (electricity)|ground loop]] problems or hums), a [[Attenuator (electronics)|pad]] switch (to accommodate different source levels and attenuate too-strong signals) and a passive filter/equalization switch for coloring the sound or tone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whirlwindusa.com/dirbox.html Whirlwind Direct Boxes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Active units==
[[Image:activedi.jpg|right|thumb|150px|An active stereo DI with pass-through in mono mode only]]
An [[Active component|active]] DI unit contains a [[preamplifier]]. Active DI units can therefore provide gain, and are inherently more complex and versatile than passive units. Active DI units require a power source, which is normally provided by batteries or a standard AC outlet connection, and may contain the option for [[phantom power]] use. Most active DI units provide switches to enhance their versatility. These may include gain or level adjustment, ground lift, power source selection, and mono or stereo mode. Ground lift switches often disconnect phantom power. Some active DI units also have electronic [[effects unit]]s.

A '''pass-through''' connector is a second jack, sometimes simply paralleled to the input connector, that delivers the input signal unchanged, to allow the DI unit to be inserted into a signal path without interrupting it. This allows a user, such as an electric bass player, to plug their bass into a DI unit, which routes the bass signal to the mixing board, and at the same time plug the bass into an onstage [[bass amp]] for monitoring purposes. Pass-through is also commonly referred to as a '''bypass'''. True-bypass occurs when the signal goes straight from the input jack to the output jack with no circuitry involved and no loading of the source impedance. False bypass (or simply 'bypass') occurs when the signal is routed through the device circuitry with [[buffer amplifier|buffering]] and no other intentional change to the signal. However, due to the nature of electrical designs there is almost always some slight change in the signal. The extent of change and how noticeable it may be can vary from unit to unit.
==Preamplifiers==
A number of companies make combination [[preamplifier]]-DI units for [[electric bass]], [[double bass]], or for acoustic instruments which use piezoelectric pickups (e.g., a violin, acoustic guitar, mandolin, etc.). These units may be housed in a "stompbox" pedal format, in a small rackmount unit (often less than a full rack space), or in units designed to be clipped to a belt or attached to an instrument. These devices are often marketed as preamplifiers, even though they also contain DI box features. 

Preamplifiers for electric bass typically contain gain knobs, sometimes including an [[fuzz bass|overdrive]] [[effect unit]], equalizer knobs and, for some higher-end units, multiple channels (e.g., a "clean" channel and a "dirty" channel, with the latter containing an overdrive effect). 

Preamp-DI units for double bass and other acoustic instruments often omit the overdrive features, but add additional features that help to produce a good sound and tone for acoustic instruments, such as an [[Dynamic range compression|audio compression]] effect, a phase inverter switch and a notch filter (the latter two features designed to help reduce unwanted [[audio feedback]] "howls"). Preamp-DIs for acoustic instruments often include two channels and a simple mixer, to enable the player to use both a pickup and a [[condensor microphone]]. Some preamp-DIs provide [[phantom power]], in case this is required to power a condenser microphone. Preamp-DI units may be battery powered, have an [[AC mains]] plug, or both.

==Typical applications==
Direct boxes are typically used with electric instruments or other electronic musical devices that only contain an unbalanced [[Phone connector (audio)|1/4" phone output]] which needs to be connected to an [[XLR connector|XLR]] input of a mixing board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jdbsound.com/art/art504.htm Direct Boxes]&lt;/ref&gt;Multiple direct box circuits can be mounted inside one housing. These are used for multiple unbalanced outputs, such as for a bank of electronic keyboards.

===Acoustic or electric instruments===
DI boxes can be used on instruments with electronic circuitry and [[pickup (music technology)|pickup]]s that do not contain an XLR balanced output. An example of this application would be an electric keyboard that needs to be connected to a mixing board, either directly or through an [[Audio multicore cable|audio snake]]. Another example would be an acoustic guitar with pickups, an electric guitar or bass guitar, or a double bass with piezoelectric pickups. These instruments could be plugged into a DI box, and the DI signal would be mixed through a mixing console into a main or monitor mix.

===Instrument amplifiers===
Some [[instrument amplifier]]s, particularly [[bass amplifier]]s, contain built-in DI units, and can be connected to a mixing console directly without needing an external direct box. This would be a typical setup for a bassist who wanted to connect their instrument through a [[public address system]] (PA system) or [[sound reinforcement system]] at a live show, while keeping the unique sound of the amplifier's [[preamplifier]] and [[Equalization (audio)|equalizer]] circuitry and the custom settings. In comparison, if an external DI box is used, with the bassist plugging her/his bass into the DI box and sending the signal to their bass amp, the DI box signal would be the direct signal from the bass' pickups. With the external DI box approach, the sound shaping added to the bass' signal on the amplifier (e.g. boosting the preamplifier, adding [[distortion (music)|overdrive]], or adjusting the equalization to change the tone) would not be present in the external DI box signal. Some instrument amplifiers have the ability to turn off the amplifier's equalizer (EQ) through a pre-eq/post-eq switch. This can be used if a "clean" direct output from the amplifier is desired, which does not contain the tone shaping created by the bassist's adjustment of the EQ controls.

It is common to use both a DI signal and a microphone in front of the speaker cabinet or combo amp, in both live sound and recording settings. One method is to connect a bass guitar amplifier's speaker level output (via a pad, to attenuate the signal) to a DI and then run it to one channel of the mixing console, and run a miked guitar speaker cabinet signal into another channel of the mixing console. Another method is to connect a DI between the guitar and the amplifier. The DI signal and mic'd guitar speaker can then be selectively blended, with the DI providing a more immediate, present, bright, un-equalized sound, and the microphone providing a more 'live' sound, with instrument amplifier and [[speaker enclosure]] characteristics and some room ambience (natural [[reverb]]).

==Examples of use==
Direct-input tracking is used on almost every electric bass part on ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', most prominently on "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds|Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds]]", "[[When I'm Sixty-Four]]", "[[Lovely Rita]]", and "[[A Day in the Life|A Day in The Life]]", as well as "[[Only a Northern Song|Only A Northern Song]]", "[[I Me Mine]]", and the lead-guitar introducing "[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]".&lt;ref name="Hodgson"&gt;Hodgson, Jay (2010). ''Understanding Records'', p.47. {{ISBN|978-1-4411-5607-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other clear examples include [[Dave Matthews Band]]'s "[[So Much to Say|So Much To Say]]" and [[Adele]]'s "[[19 (Adele album)|Daydreamer]]".&lt;ref name="Hodgson"/&gt;
The main guitar riff on [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Black Dog (song) |Black Dog]]" was recorded directly through a mic-preamp and fed through a pair of [[1176 Peak Limiter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uaudio.com/webzine/2003/april/index8.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also a member of the [[International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration]] or [[INSDC]]. It exchanges its data with [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] at the [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] and with [[GenBank]] at the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] on a daily basis. Thus these three databanks contain the same data at any given time.

DDBJ began data bank activities in 1986 at NIG and remains the only nucleotide sequence data bank in Asia. Although DDBJ mainly receives its data from Japanese researchers, it can accept data from contributors from any other country. DDBJ is primarily funded by the Japanese [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT). DDBJ has an international advisory committee which consists of nine members, 3 members each from Europe, US, and Japan. This committee advises DDBJ about its maintenance, management and future plans once a year. Apart from this DDBJ also has an international collaborative committee which advises on various technical issues related to international collaboration and consists of working-level participants.

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Dance of Death (CCLXIIIIv).jpg|thumb|right|''The Dance of Death'' (1493) by [[Michael Wolgemut]], from the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' of [[Hartmann Schedel]]]]

The '''''Danse Macabre''''' (from the [[French language]]), also called the '''''Dance of Death''''', is an artistic genre of [[allegory]] of the [[Late Middle Ages]] on the universality of [[death]]: no matter one's station in life, the Dance Macabre unites all.

The Danse Macabre consists of the dead or a [[Death (personification)|personification of death]] summoning representatives from all walks of life to dance along to the [[grave]], typically with a [[pope]], [[emperor]], [[monarch|king]], [[child]], and [[laborer]]. They were produced as [[memento mori|mementos mori]], to remind people of the fragility of their lives and how vain were the glories of earthly life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04617a.htm | title=Dance of Death | date=2007-02-20 | work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its origins are postulated from illustrated sermon texts; the earliest recorded visual scheme was a now-lost mural at [[Holy Innocents' Cemetery]] in Paris dating from 1424 to 1425.

==Paintings==
The earliest recorded visual example is the lost mural on the south wall of the cemetery of the Holy Innocents in Paris, which was painted in 1424-25 during the regency of [[John, Duke of Bedford]]: with its emphatic inclusion of a dead crowned king at a time when France did not have a crowned king, the mural may well have had a political subtext.&lt;ref&gt;Oosterwijk (2008)&lt;/ref&gt; There were also painted schemes in [[Basel]] (the earliest dating from c.1440); a series of paintings on canvas by [[Bernt Notke]], in [[Lübeck]] (1463); the initial fragment of the original Bernt Notke painting (accomplished at the end of the 15th century) in the [[St. Nicholas' Church, Tallinn|St Nicholas' Church]], [[Tallinn]], [[Estonia]] ([[Danse Macabre (Notke)|Danse Macabre]]); the painting at the back wall of the chapel of Sv. Marija na Škrilinama in the [[Istria]]n town of Beram (1471), painted by Vincent of [[Kastav]]; the painting in the [[Holy Trinity Church (Hrastovlje)|Holy Trinity Church, Hrastovlje]], Istria by [[John of Kastav]] (1490).  

A notable example was painted on the cemetery walls of the Dominican Abbey in [[Bern]] by [[Niklaus Manuel Deutsch]] in 1516/7.
This work was destroyed when the wall was torn down in 1660, but a 1649 copy by [[Albrecht Kauw]] is extant.
There was also a Dance of Death painted around 1430 and displayed on the walls of Pardon Churchyard at Old [[St Paul's Cathedral]], London, with texts by [[John Lydgate]], known as the 'Dauce of (St) Poulys', which was destroyed in 1549.

[[File:Danse Macabre - Guyot Marchand9 (Abbot and Bailiff).jpg|thumb|''La Danse macabre'' ([[Abbot]] and [[Bailiff]]). Paris, [[Guy Marchant]], 1486]]

The deathly [[crisis of the Late Middle Ages|horrors of the 14th century]] such as recurring [[famine]]s, the [[Hundred Years' War]] in [[France]], and, most of all, the [[Black Death]], were culturally assimilated throughout Europe. The omnipresent possibility of sudden and painful death increased the religious desire for [[penance]], but it also evoked a hysterical desire for amusement while still possible; a last dance as cold comfort. The danse macabre combines both desires: in many ways similar to the mediaeval [[mystery play]]s, the dance-with-death allegory was originally a [[didacticism|didactic]] dialogue poem to remind people of the inevitability of death and to advise them strongly to be prepared at all times for death (see ''[[memento mori]]'' and ''[[Ars moriendi]]'').

Short verse dialogues between Death and each of its victims, which could have been performed as plays, can be found in the direct aftermath of the Black Death in [[Germany]] and in [[Spain]]  (where it was known as the ''Totentanz'' and ''la Danza de la Muerte'', respectively). The French term ''danse macabre'' may derive from the Latin ''Chorea Machabæorum'', literally "dance of the Maccabees."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/233217?rskey=m8A5At&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false# OED.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/macabre Dictionary.reference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2 Maccabees]], a [[deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical book]] of the [[Bible]], the grim [[martyr]]dom of a [[woman with seven sons|mother and her seven sons]] is described and was a well-known mediaeval subject. It is possible that the Maccabean Martyrs were commemorated in some early French plays or that people just associated the book's vivid descriptions of the martyrdom with the interaction between Death and its prey.

An alternative explanation is that the term entered France via Spain, the {{lang-ar |مقابر}}, ''maqabir'' (cemetery) being the root of the word. Both the dialogues and the evolving paintings were ostensive penitential lessons that even illiterate people (who were the overwhelming majority) could understand.

==Frescoes==
[[Fresco]]es and murals dealing with death had a long tradition and were widespread, e.g. the legend of the Three Living and the Three Dead: on a ride or hunt, three young gentlemen meet three cadavers (sometimes described as their ancestors) who warn them, ''Quod fuimus, estis; quod sumus, vos eritis'' (What we were, you are; what we are, you will be). Numerous mural versions of that legend from the 13th century onwards have survived (for instance, in the [[:de:Heiligen-Geist-Hospital (Wismar)|Hospital Church]] of [[Wismar]] or the residential [[Longthorpe Tower]] outside [[Peterborough]]). Since they showed pictorial sequences of men and corpses covered with shrouds, those paintings are sometimes regarded as cultural precursors of the new genre.

A ''danse macabre'' painting may show a round dance headed by Death or a chain of alternating dead and live dancers. From the highest ranks of the mediaeval hierarchy (usually [[pope]] and [[emperor]]) descending to its lowest (beggar, peasant, and child), each mortal's hand is taken by a skeleton or an extremely decayed body. The famous ''Totentanz'' by Bernt Notke in [[St. Mary's Church, Lübeck]] (destroyed during the Allied [[bombing of Lübeck in World War II]]), presented the dead dancers as very lively and agile, making the impression that they were actually dancing, whereas their living dancing partners looked clumsy and passive. The apparent class distinction in almost all of these paintings is completely neutralized by Death as the ultimate equalizer, so that a sociocritical element is subtly inherent to the whole genre. The ''Totentanz'' of [[Metnitz]], for example, shows how a pope crowned with his [[mitre]] is being led into Hell by the dancing Death.

{{Wide image|Totentanz LübeckR.jpg|2000px|''Lübecker Totentanz'' by [[Bernt Notke]] (around 1463, destroyed in a bombing raid in 1942)|alt=A mural depicting a chain of alternating living and dead dancers}}

Usually, a short dialogue is attached to each victim, in which Death is summoning him (or, more rarely, her) to dance and the summoned is moaning about impending death. In the first printed ''Totentanz'' textbook (Anon.: Vierzeiliger oberdeutscher Totentanz, Heidelberger Blockbuch, approx. 1460), Death addresses, for example, the emperor:
[[File:Bernt Notke Danse Macabre.jpg|thumb|500px|Bernt Notke: ''Surmatants'' (''Totentanz'') in [[St. Nicholas' Church, Tallinn]].]]  
[[File:Totentanz in Hrastovlje.JPG|thumb|The famous Danse Macabre in [[Hrastovlje]] in the [[Holy Trinity Church (Hrastovlje)|Holy Trinity Church]]]]

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
Emperor, your sword won't help you out
Sceptre and crown are worthless here
I've taken you by the hand
For you must come to my dance
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

At the lower end of the ''Totentanz'', Death calls, for example, the peasant to dance, who answers:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;
I had to work very much and very hard
The sweat was running down my skin
I'd like to escape death nonetheless
But here I won't have any luck
&lt;/poem&gt;}}

}}{{anchor|Holbein}}The famous designs by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] (1497–1543) for his Dance of Death series were drawn in 1526 while he was in [[Basel]].  They were cut in wood by the accomplished [[Formschneider]] (block cutter) [[Hans Lützelburger]].  William Ivins (quoting W.J. Linton) writes of Lützelburger's work: "'Nothing indeed, by knife or by graver, is of higher quality than this man's doing,' for by common acclaim the originals are technically the most marvelous woodcuts ever made." &lt;ref&gt;Ivins, p.234.&lt;/ref&gt;  These woodcuts soon appeared in proofs with titles in German.  The first book edition, containing forty-one woodcuts, was published at Lyons by the Treschsel brothers in 1538.  The popularity of the work and the currency of its message are underscored by the fact that there were eleven editions before 1562 and over the sixteenth century perhaps as many as a hundred unauthorized editions and imitations.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1947), p.32&lt;/ref&gt;  Ten further designs were added in later editions.

The ''Dance of Death'' (1523–26) refashions the late-medieval [[allegory]] of the ''danse macabre'' as a reformist satire, and one can see the beginnings of a gradual shift from traditional to reformed religion.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 96–103.&lt;/ref&gt;  That shift had many permutations however, and in a thoroughly detailed study Natalie Zemon Davis has shown that the contemporary reception and afterlife of Holbein's designs lent themselves to neither purely Catholic or Protestant doctrine, but could be outfitted with different surrounding prefaces and sermons as printers and writers of different political and religious leanings took them up.  Most importantly, it was "The pictures and the Bible quotations above them were the main attractions ... Both Catholics and Protestants wished, through the pictures, to turn men's thoughts to a Christian preparation for death.".&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1538 edition which contained Latin quotations from the Bible above Holbein's designs, and a French quatrain below composed by [[Gilles Corrozet]], actually did not credit Holbein as the artist.  It bore the title: Les simulachres &amp; / HISTORIEES FACES / DE LA MORT, AUTANT ELE/gammēt pourtraictes, que artifi/ciellement imaginées. / A Lyon. / Soubz l'escu de COLOIGNE. / M.D. XXXVIII. ("Images and Illustrated facets of Death, as elegantly depicted as they are artfully conceived.")&lt;ref&gt;See External links to access to this work, including English translation, online.&lt;/ref&gt;  These images and workings of death as captured in the phrase "historiees faces" of the title "are the particular exemplification of the way death works, the individual scenes in which the lessons of mortality are brought home to people of every station." &lt;ref&gt;Gundersheimer, introduction, p.xi.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his preface to the work Jean de Vauzèle, the Prior of Montrosier, addresses Jehanne de Tourzelle, the Abbess of the Convent at St. Peter at Lyons, and names Holbein's attempts to capture the ever-present, but never directly seen, abstract images of death "simulachres."  He writes: "... simulachres les dis ie vrayement, pour ce que simulachre vient de simuler, &amp; faindre ce que n'est point." ("Simulachre they are most correctly called, for simulachre derives from the verb to simulate and to feign that which is not really there.")  He next employs a trope from the [[memento mori]] (remember we all must die) tradition and a metaphor from printing which well captures the undertakings of Death, the artist, and the printed book before us in which these simulachres of death barge in on the living: "Et pourtant qu'on n'a peu trouver chose plus approchante a la similitude de Mort, que la personne morte, on d'icelle effigie simulachres, &amp; faces de Mort, pour en nos pensees imprimer la memoire de Mort plus au vis, que ne pourroient toutes les rhetoriques descriptiones de orateurs." &lt;ref&gt;As reproduced in Gundersheimer, 1971. p.5. Register Aiii of original.&lt;/ref&gt; ("And yet we cannot discover any one thing more near the likeness of Death than the dead themselves, whence come these simulated effigies and images of Death's affairs, which imprint the memory of Death with more force than all the rhetorical descriptions of the orators ever could.").

[[File:Holbein Danse Macabre 37.jpg|right|thumb|Hans Holbein, Simolachri, Historie, e Figure de la Morte.  In Lyone Appresso.  Giovan Frellone, M.D. XLIX. (1549)]]

Holbein's series shows the figure of "Death" in many disguises, confronting individuals from all walks of life. None escape Death's skeletal clutches, not even the pious.&lt;ref&gt;Bätschmann &amp; Griener, 56–58, and Landau &amp; Parshall, 216.&lt;/ref&gt;  As Davis writes, "Holbein's pictures are independent dramas in which Death comes upon his victim in the midst of the latter's own surroundings and activities.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, p.101&lt;/ref&gt;  This is perhaps nowhere more strikingly captured than in the wonderful blocks showing the plowman earning his bread by the sweat of his brow only to have his horses speed him to his end by Death.  The Latin from the 1549 Italian edition pictured here reads: "In sudore vultus tui, vesceris pane tuo." ("Through the sweat of thy brow you shall eat your bread"), quoting Genesis 3.19.  The Italian verses below translate: ("Miserable in the sweat of your brow,/ It is necessary that you acquire the bread you need eat,/ But, may it not displease you to come with me,/ If you are desirous of rest.").   Or there is the nice balance in composition Holbein achieves between the heavy-laden traveling salesman insisting that he must still go to market while Death tugs at his sleeve to put down his wares once and for all: "Venite ad me, qui onerati estis." ("Come to me, all ye who [labor and] are heavy laden"), quoting Matthew 11.28.  The Italian here translates: ("Come with me, wretch, who are weighed down,/ Since I am the dame who rules the whole world:/ Come and hear my advice,/ Because I wish to lighten you of this load.").&lt;ref&gt;Simolachri, Historie, e Figure de la Morte.

=="Death and the Maiden" and other allusions==
The motif ''[[Death and the Maiden (motif)|Death and the Maiden]]'', is related to, and may have been derived from, the ''Danse Macabre''. It has received numerous treatments in various media—most prominently Schubert's quartet of that name. Further developments of the ''Danse Macabre'' motif include ''[[Death and the King's Horseman]]'', "[[Death and the Senator]]", "[[Death and the Compass]]", and ''Death and the Physician''.

'''Detransitioning''' is the process of changing one's [[Gender expression|gender presentation]] and/or [[sex characteristics]] back to one's [[assigned sex]], following an earlier [[transgender transition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detransitioning: Going From Male To Female To Male Again|url=http://www.vocativ.com/culture/lgbt/detransitioning-male-female-male-again/|website=Vocativ|accessdate=1 September 2017|date=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Detransitioning is also termed '''retransitioning'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transitioning Back To One’s Assigned Sex At Birth|url=http://transadvocate.com/transitioning-back-to-ones-assigned-sex-at-birth_n_9946.htm|website=The TransAdvocate|accessdate=1 September 2017 |language=en|date=7 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinician experiences==
A review of more than 100 international medical studies of post-operative transsexuals by the [[University of Birmingham]] found no robust scientific evidence that sex reassignment surgery is clinically effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jul/30/health.mentalhealth|work=[[The Guardian]]|title = Sex changes are not effective, say researchers }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some studies find that sex reassignment surgery improves the quality of life of most of those who undergo it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=van de Grift |first1=Tim C. |last2=Elaut |first2=Els |last3=Cerwenka |first3=Susanne C. |last4=Cohen-Kettenis |first4=Peggy T. |last5=Kreukels |first5=Baudewijntje P.

Genital reconstructive surgeon [[Miroslav Đorđević|Miroslav Dordevic]] said that some [[transgender]] people regret having undergone the procedure and want to detransition. He said that this is particularly so for [[transgender women]] over 30,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/transgender-women-transgender-men-sex-change-sex-reassignment-surgery-676777  |title=Transgender surgery: regret rates highest in male-to-female reassignment operations |author=Borreli, Lizette|date=3 October 2017|work=[[Newsweek]]|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Dordevic"&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://nationalpost.com/news/world/the-new-taboo-more-people-regret-sex-change-and-want-to-detransition-surgeon-says | title =The new taboo: More people regret sex change and want to ‘detransition’, surgeon says  | last =Shute  | first =Joe  | date =2 October 2017  | website =[[National Post]]  | publisher =Postmedia  | access-date =1 November 2017  | quote =Dr [[Miroslav Đorđević|Miroslav Ðordevic]] says more people, particularly transgender women over 30, are asking for reversal surgery, yet their regrets remain taboo. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that there is a "taboo" in talking about issues relating to "regret".&lt;ref name = "Dordevic"/&gt;

In August 2017, the Philadelphia-based [[Mazzoni Center]]'s Trans Health Conference, which is an annual meeting of transgender people, advocates, and health care providers, canceled a panel discussion on detransitioning.  The conference organisers said, "When a topic becomes controversial, such as this one has turned on social media, there is a duty to make sure that the debate does not get out of control at the conference itself. After several days of considerations and reviewing feedback, the planning committee voted that the workshops, while valid, cannot be presented at the conference as planned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mazzonicenter.org/blog/response-cancellation-workshops  |title=Response to the cancellation of workshops |author=|date=29 August 2017|work=[[Mazzoni Center]]|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2017, [[Bath Spa University]]  refused permission for James Caspian, a counsellor who specialises in transgender therapy, to undertake research relating to people who had decided to reverse their gender reassignment operations. Caspian alleged that the reason for the refusal was that it was, "a potentially politically incorrect piece of research [which] carries a risk to the university".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-41384473  |title=Bath Spa University 'blocks transgender research' |author=|date=25 September 2017|work=[[BBC]]|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/sep/25/bath-spa-university-transgender-gender-reassignment-reversal-research |title=University 'turned down politically incorrect transgender research' |author=Weale, Sally|date=26 September 2017|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''edcamp''' is a participant-driven conference - commonly referred to as an "[[unconference]]". Edcamps are designed to provide participant-driven professional development for K-12 educators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edcampfoundation.org/|title=Vision and mission|date=The edcamp foundation|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edcamps are modeled after [[BarCamp]]s, free participant-driven conferences with a primary focus on technology and computers.  Educational technology is a common topic area for edcamps, as are pedagogy, practical examples in instructional use of modern tools, and solving the problems technology can introduce into the classroom environment.  

Edcamps are generally free or very low-cost, built around ''[[ad hoc]]'' community participation. Sessions are not planned until the day of the event, when participants can volunteer to facilitate a conversation on a topic of their choice or simply choose an idea they are interested in learning more about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edutopia.org/blog/about-edcamp-unconference-history|title=Introduction to Edcamp: A New Conference Model Built on Collaboration|date=September 29, 2010|publisher=Edutopia|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edcamps operate "without keynote speakers or vendor booths, encourage participants to find or lead a conversation that meet their needs and interests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.courant.com/2012-08-07/community/hc-simsbury-ed-camp-20120806_1_educators-ethel-walker-participants|title=Ethel Walker To Host 'EdCamp' Conference Friday|date=August 7, 2012|work=Hartford Courant|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first edcamp was held in May 2010 in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edcampphilly.org|title=Edcamp Philly Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that time, there have been over [http://edcamp.wikispaces.com/complete+edcamp+calendar 1,000 edcamp events] held throughout the world. The [http://www.edcamp.org Edcamp Foundation] was formed in December 2011 to help teachers and other stakeholders who organize edcamps. The vision of the Edcamp Foundation is to "promote organic, participant-driven professional development for K-12 educators worldwide." The Edcamp Foundation is still located in Conshohocken, PA. The Foundation has implemented a variety of programs to help participants and organizers get the most out of edcamps like Impact Grants, Edcamp-In-A-Box, and the Urban Initiative. 

The first edcamps that were held in languages other than English were '''edcamp Stockholm''' on October 31, 2011 (in Swedish) and [http://edcamp.wikispaces.com/edcamp+Montréal edcamp Montreal] on November 1, 2011 (in French). There has also been International edcamps in Spain, China, Indonesia, Canada, and more.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="824">'''Edgeoscopy''' is a method of identification through the examination of the unique details and characteristics found along the edges of individual [[fingerprint]] ridges. These characteristics are the result of the alignment and shape of the individual ridge units and the relationship between them, as well as the effects of [[Sweat pore|pore]]s that are close to the edge of the ridges. These shapes are only of use when quality of the [[friction]] ridges found in both the latent fingerprint and the exemplar print is high. The method was pioneered by Salil Chatterjee in 1962, who created it while researching the possibility of a new [[criminal]] identification method.&lt;ref&gt;The Fingerprint Science and Ridgeology, Kuhn, Kurt E.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential''''' is published by the [[Union of International Associations]] (UIA). It is available online since 2000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://uia.org/encyclopedia?qt-encyclopedia=1#qt-encyclopedia UIA Online Encyclopedia]. Union of International Associations.&lt;/ref&gt; and was previously available as a CD-ROM and as a three-volume book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uia.org/encyclopedia?qt-encyclopedia=2#qt-encyclopedia Hardcover edition of the Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential]. Union of International Associations.&lt;/ref&gt; The online Encyclopedia is currently in a redevelopment phase.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uia.org/projects/encyclopedia UIA Encyclopedia redevelopment].

The ''Encyclopedia'' was started in 1972 and now comprises more than 100,000 entries and 700,000 links, as well as 500 pages of introductory notes and commentaries. The Encyclopedia collects information on [[problem]]s, [[strategy|strategies]], [[value (ethics)|values]], concepts of [[personal development|human development]], and various intellectual resources.

== Databases, entries, and interlinks ==
The ''Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential'' is made up from data gathered from many sources.

== Notes and commentaries within the ''Encyclopedia'' projects ==
The ''Encyclopedia of World Problems and Human Potential'' contains nearly 500 pages&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/319419 Expanding Resources on International Organizations], a review by Chadwick F. Alger, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; of introductory notes and commentaries. Some of them just provide readers with usual information about the work content and its organization. Most of them, however, represent extensive reports on the exploratory work done by the editors in eight projects (also called research areas, or sections). Here are those projects, with illustrative examples of key ideas figuring in the notes and commentaries.

=== Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project ===
A first objective of the editors in that project&lt;ref name=encycintro&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/164014 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; is to collect and present information on the following topics: the problems with which humanity perceives itself to be faced; the organizational, human, and intellectual resources it believes it has at its disposal; the values by which it is believed any change should be guided; the concepts of human development considered to be either the means or the end of any such social transformation. A second objective is to clarify the conceptual challenge of interrelating such plentiful and disparate or even contradictory information. A third objective is to enable alternation between viewpoints from different cultures, ideologies, beliefs and even "facts", as a way for individuals and societies to become empowered with an appropriate response to the problematic conditions of the moment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=5 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Overview: significance]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=4 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Overview: objectives]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/224156 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Scope and challenge]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the disagreement amongst the advocates of different approaches to problems or solutions which hinders the formation of any consensual strategy and the mobilization of adequate resources. That is why the ''Encyclopedia'' uses an approach that is as general and minimally structured as is feasible without losing coherence and utility. The intent is first to contribute to clarify the nature, extent, and interrelationships of problems and solutions. Even the distinction between problems and solutions is not always clear. For instance, housing an increasing number of people is a solution that may aggravate the problem of urban overcrowding, and the death of individuals is a problem that contributes to the solution of reducing ecological impact of overpopulation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=2 World problems project – Significance: constraints on a problem-focused approach]. Uia.be (21 May 1973). Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=23 World problems project – Comments: general]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia'' databases are much about how problems, strategies, values, development concepts, and organizations are linked together. As a result, the possibility of focusing on [[feedback|feedback loops]] has proven to be an important feature of the ''Encyclopedia'', and a program has been carried out to identify "''vicious problem loops''". A vicious problem loop is a chain of problems, each aggravating the next, and with the last looping back to aggravate the first in the chain.  Here is an example: Man-made disasters, Vulnerability of ecosystem niches, Natural environment degradation, Shortage of natural resources, Unbridled competition for scarce resources, Man-made disasters. Solutions that focus on only one problem in a chain may fail or even be harmful, because the cycle has the capacity to regenerate itself, and also because several cycles may interlock, forming tangled skeins of interlinked global problems. The loop detection program detected more than 50,000 loops (of up to 9 elements) in more than 12,000 problem profiles. It is thought that a similar work could be done about mutually facilitating or constraining strategy loops, so as to constitute a dynamic response to aggravating or reducing loops of problems through a circle of matching strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=19 Global strategies project – Strategic ecosystem: feedback loops and dependent co-arising]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-intelligible.org/projects/ecolynx/final%20report%20complete_2000.pdf Information Context for Biodiversity Conservation]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Other examples of loops can be seen at [http://www.uia.be/node/157?kap=7 Transformative approaches project – Analysis: Vicious cycles and loops] and [http://www.uia.be/node/157?kap=9 Transformative approaches project – Examples of vicious problem cycles and loops]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World problems and global issues ===
That project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/285958 World problems project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; endeavors to present all the phenomena in society that are perceived negatively by groups transcending national frontiers. Those phenomena constitute a challenge to creative remedial action. Groups are strongly motivated by the [[problem]]s that infringe their values and arouse their indignation. As such, problems are a major stimulus driving the development of society. Although there is agreement that problems are numerous and that many are really serious, little effort has been made to determine how many problems there are. Likewise, while it is becoming increasingly evident that problems interact with one another, and constitute complex networks or systems, little effort has been made to map that [[complexity]]. The perceptions documented in that project raise useful questions concerning the nature and existence of problems, especially when other groups consider that one perception or another is irrelevant, misleading or misinformed. An aim of that research area, then, is to assemble information whose significance is collectively repressed, displaced onto some less threatening problems, or projected in the form of blame onto some other social group.&lt;ref name=sections&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/163?kap=11 Encyclopedia of world problems and human potential project – Content: sections and sub-sections].

Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Views concerning problems are extremely varied. Several pages in the notes and commentaries deal with that variety. Problems are agenda items for assemblies or conferences; action targets for organizations; issues for political parties or governments; events or topics for the media; markets for businesses; sins for religions; puzzles for sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=8 World problems project – Criteria: problem disguises and problem evasion]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Problems can be viewed as synonymous with chaos and disorder, or as elements in an ordered array; as static or dynamic entities; as discrete or continuous phenomena; as objective things or subjective experiences; as directly experienceable phenomena or as indirect implications of seemingly innocent phenomena; as inherently comprehensible or incomprehensible entities; as the results of due processes or as spontaneous phenomena. For many people in the West problems may be considered as artifacts of concerned minds, about which reason, principles, or history are relevant, while in the East to conceive of life as presenting problems to be solved may be seen as a misconception of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=7 World problems project – Criteria: assumptions]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Other pages of notes and commentaries deal extensively with the variety of points of view under headings such as ''Approaches to problems'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=24 World problems project – Comments: approaches to problems]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Beyond the problem-lobby mindset'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=25 World problems project – Comments: beyond the problem-lobby mindset].

Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global strategies and solutions ===
That project&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/190 Global strategies project]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; aims at identifying the complete range of [[strategy|strategies]] perceived by constituencies acting at the international level.

The conventional way of addressing any problem situation is to elaborate a strategy, but given the number, variety and interrelationships of the problems, it is uncertain whether any conventional strategy could be adequate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/304593 Global strategies project – Rationale]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, many groups have "answers" to the current crisis. The proponents of each such answer naturally attach special importance to their own as being of crucial relevance at this time, or even as being the only appropriate basis for a viable world society in the future. However, that focus on "answer production", a vital moving force in society, obscures the manner in which such answers, in the absence of integration between them, undermine each other’s significance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/165?kap=1 World problems project – Significance: acknowledgement of the universe of problems]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears to the editors that the elements of the strategic challenge at this time include:
*a vast and changing network of perceived problems, on which no single body has (or possibly could have) adequate control;
*a vast and changing network of conceptual tools and knowledge resources, which is not (and possibly could not be) controlled by any single body;
*a vast and changing [[social network|network]] of agencies, organizations, groups and active individuals spanning every conceivable human interest and extending from the community level to the international level, and on which no single body has (or possibly could or should have) adequate control.
The strategic problem therefore is how to ensure that the appropriate organizational resources emerge, and are supported with appropriate conceptual tools, in response to emerging problem complexes. But it would seem that this must be achieved without organizing such response – for to the extent that any part of the network is organized, other parts will develop (and probably should develop) which favor alternative approaches. The challenge is therefore to clarify the conditions of a network strategy, i.e. an approach which facilitates or catalyses (rather than organizes) the development of organizational networks in response to problem networks, in the light of values perceived in various parts of the social system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=20 Global strategies project – Strategic ecosystem: network strategy]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many pages of notes and commentaries describe in details various approaches to global strategies, and their limits. Such are ''Strategic ecosystem: beyond "The Plan"'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=18 Global strategies project – Strategic ecosystem: beyond "The Plan"]. Union of International Associations.

Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A long series of pages explores how to "move beyond the unimodal answer and recognize that because each form of action has both strengths and weaknesses, the key to a more effectively multimodal answer lies in finding how to interrelate the various unimodal answers so that they correct for each others weaknesses and counteract each others excesses.” But, it must also be asked, is integrated action of any type feasible at this time? The exploration begins with ''Strategic appropriateness: questionable answers'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=44 Global strategies project – Strategic appropriateness: questionable answers]. Union of International Associations. Retrieved on 23 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and finishes with ''Action implications: consensus, uncertainty and action formulation''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/159?kap=72 Global strategies project – Action implications: consensus, uncertainty and action formulation].

Work on the first edition started with funds from Mankind 2000, matching those of the [[Union of International Associations|UIA]]. The publisher [[K G Saur Verlag|Klaus Saur]], of Munich, provided funds, in conjunction with those from the UIA, for work on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th editions. Seed funding for the third volume of the 4th edition was also provided on behalf of Mankind 2000.&lt;ref name=backstrat /&gt; In the nineties, seed funding was provided, again on behalf of Mankind 2000, for computer equipment which subsequently allowed the UIA to develop a large website and make progressively available for free the ''Encyclopedia'' databases as from the 1994–1995 edition. In turn, this proven [[knowledge management]] capacity enabled the UIA, on the initiative of Nadia McLaren, a consultant ecologist who has been a primary editor for the ''Encyclopedia'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.be/node/164090 Nadia McLaren].

The ''Encyclopedia'' was the fruit of a continuing processing of documents gathered from many of the thousands of the [[international organization]]s profiled in the ''[[Yearbook of International Organizations]]''. Many such bodies regularly produce a wide range of material on the areas of their concern, many regularly send documents to the UIA, and many, when requested more specifically, supplied documents for the ''Encyclopedia''. The following organizations provided documents in the greatest quantity: FAO, ILO, UNICEF, UNESCO, UNCTD, WHO, Commonwealth Secretariat, Council of Europe, OECD, World Bank group.

He reports in ''Encyclopedia Illusions''&lt;ref name=illusions /&gt; how the narrow focus of the [[Club of Rome]] on a few socio-economic aspects of futures research prompted the much vaster exploration concerning world problems and human potential.

Anthony Judge was the architect and managing editor of the ''Encyclopedia''. He was also the main author of the notes and commentaries. The principal editors over the years have been, for different editions, Jon Jenkins and Maureen Jenkins (who had also worked at the Institute of Cultural Affairs), Owen Victor, Jacqueline Nebel, Nadia McLaren, and Tomáš Fülöpp. There were also enthusiastic editorial contributions from volunteers.

[[Richard Slaughter]] emphasized that the significance of the work is not its size or the scope of its references, impressive though these are. It is rather in the nature of what has been attempted. The accompanying notes and commentaries, he said, are good enough to be published separately because they contain highly cogent observations on the "global problematique", commentaries on the work of numerous great thinkers from a wide variety of fields, and an impressive array of insights about the epistemology, symbolism, metaphysics, metaphors and linguistic representations of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uia.org/reviews/slaught.php A meta-linguistic resource] Richard A.

There are two types of '''exhibition catalogue''' (or '''exhibition catalog'''): a printed list of exhibits at an [[Art exhibition|art]] exhibition; and a directory of exhibitors at a [[trade fair]] or business-to-business event.

==Art or museum exhibition catalogues==
Catalogues for art or museum exhibitions may range in scale from a single printed sheet to a lavish [[hardcover]] "[[coffee table book]]". The advent of cheap colour-[[printing]] in the 1960s transformed what had usually been simple "handlists" with several works to each page into large scale "descriptive catalogues" that are intended as both contributions to scholarship and books likely to appeal to many general readers.  The catalogues for exhibitions held at a museum are now often far more detailed than the catalogues of their permanent collections. 
  
In the early 21st century, exhibitions that gather items from other institutions (museums, galleries, libraries, etc.) and that are elaborately publicized very often have catalogues in the form of substantial books.

===Format of art catalogues===
Book-sized exhibition catalogues in the West typically have a colour photograph of every item on display, and also of other relevant works not in the exhibition (these usually smaller and often in black and white).  There will be a short formal catalogue description of each item, and usually interpretative text often amounting to one or more pages.  The resulting book will have at least one introductory essay, often several, footnotes, [[bibliography]] and other [[critical apparatus]].  It is usually only in the language of the location, although if the exhibition is travelling internationally, local translated editions will be produced for each location.  The book may be published by the institution that hosts the exhibition (or one of these institutions), but is distributed by and often co-published with a larger publisher.  It will not dwell on the fact that it is the catalogue of a particular exhibition, and often will not contain a plan of the exhibition.  Visitors to the exhibition will anyway know this, and the intention - often successful - is to create a book which has a permanent usefulness.  Nearly all are produced in [[paperback]]; a hardback edition is a sign of serious intentions.  Most major catalogues are sold in at least some bookshops, and are available for order more widely through the booktrade.  Many receive specific sponsorship to finance them, and usually a number of authors contribute.
[[File:Bibliotheca Zriniana (Croatia) - katalog.jpg|thumb|Front cover of the 2008 [[Čakovec]] exhibition catalogue of ''[[Bibliotheca Zriniana]]'' library from 1662, owned by [[Nikola Zrinski]], Ban (Viceroy) of Croatia]]

In recent decades, exhibition catalogues have grown to prodigious sizes and may be the most comprehensive sources for even rather large subject areas.  Probably the largest to be produced were in the 1970s in a competitive spree by Italian provinces and German [[States of Germany|lander]] to promote the significance of their region by mounting huge exhibitions on the period when its cultural production was at its peak.  A typical example is the three-volume ''Die ''Parler'' und der schöne Stil 1350-1400. Europäische Kunst unter den Luxemburgern'' from [[Cologne]] of 1978, with a further two volumes published in 1980 on a colloquium held in conjunction with the exhibition.  The three volumes covering the exhibition proper amount to over a thousand pages and it would have been unfeasible to have taken them into the exhibition itself.  Another example is ''The History of Japanese Photography,'' 432 pages long and with over four hundred plates.

This trend was led in Britain by the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] and in the USA by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington.

===Japanese catalogues===
Japanese exhibition catalogues often provide captions, a certain amount of text, or both in a second language (usually English), and occasionally also a smaller amount in a third language. This is not always so: the large catalogue (over 360 pages) for a major exhibition of the [[Woodblock printing in Japan|wood-block]] artist [[Yasunori Taninaka]] is in Japanese alone. Meanwhile, ''Works by 25 Photographers in their 20s'' is completely bilingual, Japanese and English.

The great majority of Japanese exhibition catalogues are only available directly from the galleries or museums that host or hosted the exhibitions. These catalogues are acquired and shelved by libraries together with other books and are available on the used book market, but lack [[ISBN]]s. However, exceptions do exist: the catalogue of an exhibition of the photographs of [[Nakaji Yasui]] was produced via an independent publisher and distributed as a regular book.

==Catalogues for trade fairs==
Exhibition catalogues are used at commercial exhibitions and trade fairs to profile all the exhibitors at the event. They serve not only as a guide for visitors on the day, but also as an industry directory used afterwards by visitors (and others) to find suppliers and business partners.

Many exhibition catalogues are used by market researchers because they contain good quality information about companies that are active in a particular market place.

A typical exhibition catalogue contains the following: 
* Introduction and welcome message from the event organiser
* Floor plan showing the location of each exhibition stand
* Summary alphabetical list of exhibitors
* Exhibitor profiles (normally a textual description of each exhibitor plus their contact details)
* A ‘buyer’s guide’ where exhibitors are listed under relevant product or service categories
* Details of seminars or conference sessions running alongside the exhibition
* Advertisements promoting the exhibitors

The format of exhibition catalogues for trade fairs can range from A5-sized ‘saddle-stitched’ publications with descriptions of as few as 30-40 exhibitors, to much larger perfect-bound ‘stretched A5’ or A4-sized directories containing profiles on thousands of companies exhibiting at major international trade events such as The [[London Book Fair]], SIAL (the Paris-based food exhibition), and [[Nuremberg International Toy Fair]] (Spielwarenmesse).

The exhibition organiser is ultimately responsible for publishing the catalogue for their own event. However, many organisers outsource the design, production and advertising sales for these publications to specialist exhibition catalogue contract publishers operating within the exhibitions industry.

Other common terms to describe the exhibition catalogue at a trade fair include 'event guide', 'show guide', 'show catalogue', 'exhibition directory', 'fair guide' or 'exhibition guide'. Often exhibition organisers will add the word 'official' to the front of the name of the publication (e.g. 'Official exhibition catalogue') to distinguish their publication from unofficial exhibition catalogues for their event produced by trade magazine publishers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1376">The '''First Things First''' manifesto was written 29 November 1963 and published in 1964 by [[Ken Garland]]. It was backed by over 400 graphic designers and artists and also received the backing of [[Tony Benn]], radical left-wing MP and activist, who published it in its entirety in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper.

Reacting against a rich and affluent Britain of the 1960s, it tried to re-radicalise a design industry which the signatories felt had become lazy and uncritical. Drawing on ideas shared by [[critical theory]], the [[Frankfurt School]] and the counter-culture of the time it explicitly reaffirmed the belief that design is not a neutral, value-free process.

It rallied against the consumerist culture that was purely concerned with buying and selling things and tried to highlight a [[Humanism|Humanist]] dimension to graphic design theory. It was later updated and republished with a new group of signatories as the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto]].

'''Fluxomics''' describes the various approaches that seek to determine the rates of [[metabolic]] reactions within a biological entity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winter|first=Gal|last2=Krömer|first2=Jens O.|date=2013-07-01|title=Fluxomics – connecting 'omics analysis and phenotypes|journal=Environmental Microbiology|language=en|volume=15|issue=7|pages=1901–1916|doi=10.1111/1462-2920.12064|issn=1462-2920|pmid=23279205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While metabolomics can provide instantaneous information on the metabolites in a biological sample, metabolism is a dynamic process.&lt;ref name="Cascante 67–82"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cascante|first=Marta|last2=Marin|first2=Silvia|date=2008-09-30|title=Metabolomics and fluxomics approaches|url=http://essays.biochemistry.org/content/45/67|journal=Essays in Biochemistry|language=en|volume=45|pages=67–82|doi=10.1042/bse0450067|issn=0071-1365|pmid=18793124}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance of fluxomics is that metabolic fluxes determine the cellular phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fluxomics|last=Cascante|first=Marta|last2=Benito|first2=Adrián|last3=Mas|first3=Igor Marín de|last4=Centelles|first4=Josep J.|last5=Miranda|first5=Anibal|last6=Atauri|first6=Pedro de|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=9783319010076|editor-last=Orešič|editor-first=Matej|pages=237–250|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-01008-3_12|editor2-last=Vidal-Puig|editor2-first=Antonio}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has the added advantage of being based on the [[metabolome]] which has fewer components than the genome or proteome.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raamsdonk|first=Léonie M.|last2=Teusink|first2=Bas|last3=Broadhurst|first3=David|last4=Zhang|first4=Nianshu|last5=Hayes|first5=Andrew|last6=Walsh|first6=Michael C.|last7=Berden|first7=Jan A.|last8=Brindle|first8=Kevin M.|last9=Kell|first9=Douglas B.|date=2001-01-01|title=A functional genomics strategy that uses metabolome data to reveal the phenotype of silent mutations|url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v19/n1/full/nbt0101_45.html|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=en|volume=19|issue=1|pages=45–50|doi=10.1038/83496|issn=1087-0156|pmid=11135551}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fluxomics falls within the field of [[systems biology]] which developed with the appearance of high throughput technologies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aon|first=Miguel A.|last2=Cortassa|first2=Sonia|date=2015-07-22|title=Systems Biology of the Fluxome|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/3/3/607|journal=Processes|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=607–618|doi=10.3390/pr3030607}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Systems biology recognizes the complexity of biological systems and has the broader goal of explaining and predicting this complex behavior.&lt;ref name="Cascante 67–82"/&gt;

== Metabolic flux ==
Metabolic flux refers to the rate of metabolite conversion in a metabolic network.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349514030690|title=From Metabolomics to Fluxomics: A Computational Procedure to Translate Metabolite Profiles into Metabolic Fluxes|access-date=2016-04-11|doi=10.1016/j.bpj.2014.11.1857|volume=108|issue=1|pages=163–172|journal=Biophysical Journal|pmid=25564863|pmc=4286601 | last1 = Cortassa | first1 = S | last2 = Caceres | first2 = V | last3 = Bell | first3 = LN | last4 = O'Rourke | first4 = B | last5 = Paolocci | first5 = N | last6 = Aon | first6 = MA|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For a reaction this rate is a function of both enzyme abundance and enzyme activity.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Enzyme concentration is itself a function of transcriptional and translational regulation in addition to the stability of the protein.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Enzyme activity is affected by the kinetic parameters of the enzyme, the substrate concentrations, the product concentrations, and the effector molecules concentration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  The genomic and environmental effects on metabolic flux are what determine healthy or diseased phenotype.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Fluxome ==
Similar to genome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome, the fluxome is defined as the complete set of metabolic fluxes in a cell.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  However, unlike the others the fluxome is a dynamic representation of the phenotype.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This is due to the fluxome resulting from the interactions of the metabolome, genome, transcriptome, proteome, post-translational modifications and the environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Flux analysis technologies ==
Two important technologies are [[flux balance analysis]] (FBA) and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-fluxomics.  In FBA metabolic fluxes are estimated by first representing the metabolic reactions of a metabolic network in a numerical matrix containing the stoichiometric coefficients of each reaction.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Orth|first=Jeffrey D.|last2=Thiele|first2=Ines|last3=Palsson|first3=Bernhard Ø|date=2010-03-01|title=What is flux balance analysis?|url=http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v28/n3/full/nbt.1614.html|journal=Nature Biotechnology|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=245–248|doi=10.1038/nbt.1614|issn=1087-0156|pmc=3108565|pmid=20212490}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stoichiometric coefficients constrain the system model and are why FBA is only applicable to steady state conditions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Additional constraints can be imposed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  By providing constraints the possible set of solutions to the system are reduced.  Following the addition of constraints the system model is optimized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Flux-balance analysis resources include the BIGG database,&lt;ref name="KingLu2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Zachary A.|last2=Lu|first2=Justin|last3=Dräger|first3=Andreas|last4=Miller|first4=Philip|last5=Federowicz|first5=Stephen|last6=Lerman|first6=Joshua A.|last7=Ebrahim|first7=Ali|last8=Palsson|first8=Bernhard O.|last9=Lewis|first9=Nathan E.|title=BiGG Models: A platform for integrating, standardizing and sharing genome-scale models|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=44|issue=D1|year=2016|pages=D515–D522|issn=0305-1048|doi=10.1093/nar/gkv1049|pmid=26476456|pmc=4702785}}&lt;/ref&gt; the COBRA toolbox,&lt;ref name="SchellenbergerQue2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schellenberger|first1=Jan|last2=Que|first2=Richard|last3=Fleming|first3=Ronan M T|last4=Thiele|first4=Ines|last5=Orth|first5=Jeffrey D|last6=Feist|first6=Adam M|last7=Zielinski|first7=Daniel C|last8=Bordbar|first8=Aarash|last9=Lewis|first9=Nathan E|last10=Rahmanian|first10=Sorena|last11=Kang|first11=Joseph|last12=Hyduke|first12=Daniel R|last13=Palsson|first13=Bernhard Ø|title=Quantitative prediction of cellular metabolism with constraint-based models: the COBRA Toolbox v2.0|journal=Nature Protocols|volume=6|issue=9|year=2011|pages=1290–1307|issn=1754-2189|doi=10.1038/nprot.2011.308|pmid=21886097|pmc=3319681}}&lt;/ref&gt; and FASIMU.&lt;ref name="HoppeHoffmann2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoppe|first1=Andreas|last2=Hoffmann|first2=Sabrina|last3=Gerasch|first3=Andreas|last4=Gille|first4=Christoph|last5=Holzhütter|first5=Hermann-Georg|title=FASIMU: flexible software for flux-balance computation series in large metabolic networks|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|volume=12|issue=1|year=2011|pages=28|issn=1471-2105|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-12-28|pmid=21255455|pmc=3038154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-fluxomics, metabolic precursors are enriched with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C before being introduced to the system.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krömer | first1 = J. | last2 = Quek | first2 = L. E. | last3 = Nielsen | first3 = L. | year = 2009 | title = 13C-Fluxomics: a tool for measuring metabolic phenotypes | url = | journal = Aust Biochem | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 17–20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using an imaging technique such as mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy the level of incorporation of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C into metabolites can be measured and with stoichiometry the metabolic fluxes can be estimated.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Stoichiometric and kinetic paradigms==
A number of different methods, broadly divided into [[stoichiometric]] and [[Chemical kinetics|kinetic]] paradigms.

Within the stoichiometric paradigm, a number of relatively simple linear algebra methods use restricted [[metabolic network]]s or genome-scale [[metabolic network modelling|metabolic network models]] to perform [[flux balance analysis]] and the array of techniques derived from it.  These linear equations are useful for steady state conditions.  Dynamic methods are not yet usable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Fluxomics – connecting 'omics analysis and phenotypes|journal = Environmental Microbiology|date = 2013-07-01|issn = 1462-2920|pages = 1901–1916|volume = 15|issue = 7|doi = 10.1111/1462-2920.12064|language = en|first = Gal|last = Winter|first2 = Jens O.|last2 = Krömer|pmid=23279205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the more experimental side, [[metabolic flux analysis]] allows the empirical estimation of reaction rates by [[Isotopic labeling|stable isotope labelling]].

Within the kinetic paradigm, kinetic modelling of metabolic networks can be purely theoretical, exploring the potential space of dynamic metabolic fluxes under perturbations away from steady state using formalisms such as [[biochemical systems theory]]. Such explorations are most informative when accompanied by empirical measurements of the system under study following actual perturbations, as is the case in [[metabolic control analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Demin | first1 = O. | last2 = Goryanin | first2 = I. | title = Kinetic Modelling in Systems Biology | year = 2010 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | isbn = 9781420011661 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constraint based reconstruction and analysis==
Collected methods in fluxomics have been described as "COBRA" methods, for ''co''nstraint ''b''ased ''r''econstruction and ''a''nalysis. A number of software tools and environments have been created for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Klamt | first1 = S. | last2 = Saez-Rodriguez | first2 = J. | last3 = Gilles | first3 = E.

Although it can only be measured indirectly, [[Flux (metabolism)|metabolic flux]] is the critical link between genes, proteins and the observable phenotype.  This is due to the fluxome integrating mass-energy, information, and signaling networks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Systems Biology of the Fluxome|url = http://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/3/3/607|journal = Processes|date = 2015-07-22|pages = 607–618|volume = 3|issue = 3|doi = 10.3390/pr3030607|language = en|first = Miguel A.|last = Aon|first2 = Sonia|last2 = Cortassa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluxomics has the potential to provide a quantifiable representation of the effect the environment has on the phenotype because the fluxome describes the genome environment interaction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In the fields of metabolic engineering&lt;ref name="Kildegaard-2013"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Kildegaard | first1 = HF. | last2 = Baycin-Hizal | first2 = D. | last3 = Lewis | first3 = NE. | last4 = Betenbaugh | first4 = MJ. | title = The emerging CHO systems biology era: harnessing the 'omics revolution for biotechnology | journal = Curr Opin Biotechnol | volume =  24| issue =  6| pages =  1102–7|date=Mar 2013 | doi = 10.1016/j.copbio.2013.02.007 | pmid = 23523260 | url = http://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/the-emerging-cho-systems-biology-era-harnessing-the-omics-revolution-for-biotechnology(3d14cbfe-7a58-4483-8e29-db98b61fd906).html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and systems biology,&lt;ref name="Carlson-2012"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Carlson | first1 = RP. | last2 = Oshota | first2 = OJ. | last3 = Taffs | first3 = RL. | title = Systems analysis of microbial adaptations to simultaneous stresses | journal = Subcell Biochem | volume = 64 | issue =  | pages = 139–57 | month =  | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1007/978-94-007-5055-5_7 | pmid = 23080249 | series = Subcellular Biochemistry | isbn = 978-94-007-5054-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; fluxomic methods are considered a key enabling technology due to their unique position in the ontology of biological processes, allowing genome scale stoichiometric models to act as a framework for the integration of diverse biological datasets.&lt;ref name="Duarte-2007"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Duarte | first1 = NC. | last2 = Becker | first2 = SA. | last3 = Jamshidi | first3 = N. | last4 = Thiele | first4 = I. | last5 = Mo | first5 = ML. | last6 = Vo | first6 = TD. | last7 = Srivas | first7 = R. | last8 = Palsson | first8 = BØ. | title = Global reconstruction of the human metabolic network based on genomic and bibliomic data | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 104 | issue = 6 | pages = 1777–82 |date=Feb 2007 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0610772104 | pmid = 17267599 | pmc=1794290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of use in research ==
One potential application of fluxomic techniques is in drug design.  Rama et al.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raman|first=Karthik|last2=Rajagopalan|first2=Preethi|last3=Chandra|first3=Nagasuma|title=Flux Balance Analysis of Mycolic Acid Pathway: Targets for Anti-Tubercular Drugs|journal=PLoS Computational Biology|volume=1|issue=5|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010046|pmc=1246807|pmid=16261191|pages=e46|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; used FBA to study the mycolic acid pathway in ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis''.

A '''gay bathhouse''', also known as a '''gay sauna''' or a '''gay steambath''', is a commercial space for [[men who have sex with men|men to have sex with other men]]. In [[gay slang]], a bathhouse may be called just "the baths," "the sauna" or "the tubs". In general, a gay bath is mainly used for having [[sexual activity]] rather than only [[bathing]].&lt;ref name="Prior2007"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender |date=2007 |page=121 |chapter=Baths, Public: III.&amp;#160;West, Middle Ages–Present |last=Prior |first=Jason |editor1-last=Malti‑Douglas |editor1-first=Fedwa |editor2-last=Choksy |editor2-first=Jamsheed K. |editor3-last=Roof |editor3-first=Judith |editor4-last=Sautman |editor4-first=Francesca Canadé |editor5-last=Jones |editor5-first=Sumie |editor6-last=Zhou |editor6-first=Liana |publisher=Thomson Gale |location=Farmington Hills, Michigan |volume=1:&amp;#160;A–C |isbn=978-0-02-865961-9 |lccn=2007020796 |oclc=894526708}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Colker1994"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-10/local/me-32240_1_gay-bathhouse |title=Within the Walls of Gay Bathhouse Lies a World of Their Own |work=Los Angeles Times |date=1994-03-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222212010/http://articles.latimes.com/1994-03-10/local/me-32240_1_gay-bathhouse |archive-date=2014-12-22 |dead-url=no |last=Colker |first=David |issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all men who visit a gay bathhouse are considered [[homosexuality|gay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Woods|Binson|2003|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Graham Gremore, "Straight guys in gay bathhouses? Yep, it happens. Former employee tells all," ''[[Quora]]'', August 10, 2017, https://www.queerty.com/straight-guys-gay-bathhouses-yep-happens-former-employee-tells-20170810.&lt;/ref&gt; Bathhouses offering similar services for women are rare, but some men's bathhouses occasionally have a "[[lesbian]]" or "women only" night.

Bathhouses vary considerably in size and amenities{{spnd}}from small establishments with 10 or 20 rooms and a handful of lockers to multi-story saunas with a variety of room styles or sizes and several steam baths, [[Jacuzzi]] tubs, and sometimes [[swimming pool]]s. Most have a steam room (or wet sauna), dry sauna, showers, lockers, and small private rooms.

Many bathhouses are, for legal reasons, "membership only", though membership is generally open to any [[Age of consent|adult]] who seeks it, usually after paying a small fee. Unlike [[brothel]]s, customers pay only for the use of the facilities. Sexual activity, if it occurs, is not provided by staff of the establishment but is between customers, and no money is exchanged. Many gay bathhouses, for legal reasons, explicitly prohibit or discourage [[prostitution]] and ban known prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Let's emphasize 'safe' part of safe sex |work=Plain Dealer (Cleveland) |date=July 21, 2006 |author=Regina Brett |quote=The Flex club opens in August.

Records of men meeting for sex with other men in bathhouses date back to the 15th century. A tradition of public baths dates back to the 6th century BC, and there are many ancient records of [[Homosexuality in ancient Greece|homosexual activity in Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|De Bonneville|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Western world|West]], gay men have been using bathhouses for sex since at least the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a time when homosexual acts were illegal in most Western countries and men who were caught engaging in homosexual acts were often arrested and publicly humiliated. Men began frequenting [[Cruising for sex|cruising]] areas such as bathhouses, public parks, alleys, train and bus stations, adult theaters, public lavatories ([[cottaging|cottages or tearooms]]), and gym changing rooms where they could meet other men for sex. Some bathhouse owners tried to prevent sex between patrons while others, mindful of profits or prepared to risk prosecution, overlooked discreet homosexual activity.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

===Early records===
; 1492 Florence
: In [[Florence]], [[Italy]], in 1492 there was a purge against the "vice of sodomy". The places used for homosexual acts were to be taverns, baths, and ''casini'' (sheds or houses used for illicit sex and gambling). The ''Eight of Watch'' (the city's leading criminal court) issued several [[decree]]s associated with [[sodomy]] and on April 11, 1492 they warned the managers of bathhouses to keep out "suspect boys" on penalty of a fine. In the short period from April 1492 to February 1494 they convicted 44 men for homosexual relations not involving violence or aggravating circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Rocke|1998|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; 1876 Paris
: In France the first recorded [[police raid]] on a [[Paris]]ian bathhouse was in 1876 in the ''Bains de Gymnase'' on the ''Rue du Faubourg-Poissonnière''. Six men aged 14 to 22 were prosecuted for an ''offence against public decency'' and the manager and two employees for ''facilitating [[pederasty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Higgs|1999|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; 1903 New York
: In the [[United States]] on February 21, 1903, [[New York City Police|New York police]] conducted the first recorded raid on a gay bathhouse, the ''Ariston Hotel Baths''. 26 men were arrested and 12 brought to trial on sodomy charges; 7 men received sentences ranging from 4 to 20 years in prison.&lt;ref name=Chauncey&gt;{{harv|Chauncey|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New York City]], the ''[[Everard Baths|Everard]]'' (nicknamed the ''Everhard'')&lt;ref name=Stein2004&gt;{{harv|Stein|2004|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; was converted from a church to a bathhouse in 1888 and was patronized by gay men before the 1920s and by the 1930s had a reputation as the "classiest, safest, and best known of the baths".&lt;ref name=neilmiller/&gt; It was damaged by fire on May 25, 1977, when nine men died and several others were seriously injured. The Everard closed in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/03/nyregion/4-new-york-bathhouses-still-operate-under-city-s-program-of-inspections.html |title=4 New York Bathhouses still operate under city's program of inspections |work=The New York Times |date=May 3, 1987 |accessdate=22 December 2006 |last=Bronstein |first=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also popular in the 1910s were the ''Produce Exchange Baths'' and the ''Lafayette Baths'' (403–405 Lafayette Street, which from 1916 was managed by [[Ira Gershwin|Ira]] &amp; [[George Gershwin]]). American [[:Category:Precisionism|precisionist]] painter [[Charles Demuth]] used the Lafayette Baths as his favourite haunt. His 1918 homoerotic self-portrait set in a [[Turkish bath]] is likely to have been inspired by it.&lt;ref name=neilmiller/&gt; The ''Penn Post Baths'' in a hotel basement (the  [[Penn Post Hotel]], 304 West 31st Street) was a popular gay location in the 1920s despite a seedy condition and the lack of private rooms.&lt;ref name=neilmiller&gt;{{harv|Miller|1995|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American composer [[Charles Griffes]] (1884–1920) wrote in his diaries about visits to the [[New York City]] bathhouses and the [[YMCA]]. His biography states: "So great was his need to be with boys, that though his home contained two pianos, he chose to practice at an instrument at the Y, and his favourite time was when the players were coming and going from their games."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gustav-Wrathall|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|When a friend with "little experience but great desire" confided his homosexual longings to Charles Griffes in 1916, Griffes took him to the Lafayette so that he could meet other gay men and explore his sexual interests in a supportive environment: the friend was "astounded and fascinated" by what he saw there. The baths also encouraged more advanced forms of sexual experimentation. Griffes himself had had his first encounter with a man interested in sadomasochism at the Lafayette two years earlier (he found the man "interesting" but the experience unappealing), and several men interviewed in the mid-1930s referred to experimenting in the baths and learning of new pleasures.&lt;ref name=Chauncey/&gt;|George Chauncey|Gay New York 1995}}

In [[London]], the Savoy Turkish Baths at 92 Jermyn Street became a favourite spot (opening in 1910 and remaining open until September 1975).&lt;ref name=Potvin2008&gt;{{citation |year=2008 |title=Material and visual cultures beyond male bonding, 1870–1914: bodies, boundaries and intimacy |first1=John |last1=Potvin |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=9780754656654 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8KCxAAAAIAAJ |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist A.J. Langguth wrote: "...[The baths at Jermyn Street] represented a twilight arena for elderly men who came to sweat poisons from their systems and youths who came to strike beguiling poses in Turkish towels... although they were closely overseen by attendants, they provided a discreet place to inspect a young man before offering a cup of tea at [[J.

In the 1950s the [[Bermondsey]] Turkish Baths were rated by [[Kenneth Williams]] as "quite fabulous" in his diaries.&lt;ref name=houlbrook/&gt;
{{Quotation|''Steambaths in the 1930s: ''The steambaths that had been well known to me were those of East Ham, Greenwich and Bermondsey. In the first two it was frequently possible to indulge in what the Spartacus Guide coyly describes as 'action', but behaviour at all times had to be reasonably cautious.

===Modern gay bathhouses===
[[File:Crew Club - Washington, D.C..JPG|thumb|Crew Club, in the [[Logan Circle, Washington, D.C.|Logan Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
In the 1950s exclusively gay bathhouses began to open in the United States. Though subject to [[Vice squad|vice raids]], these bathhouses were "oases of homosexual camaraderie"&lt;ref name=History/&gt; and were, as they remain today, "places where it was safe to be gay",&lt;ref name=History/&gt; whether or not patrons themselves identified as homosexual. The gay baths offered a much safer alternative to [[public sex|sex in other public places]].&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

In the late 1960s and 1970s, gay bathhouses{{spnd}}now primarily gay-owned and operated{{spnd}}became fully licensed gay establishments which soon became major gay institutions. These bathhouses served as informal gay meeting places, places where friends could meet and relax. Gay bathhouses frequently threw parties for [[Gay pride|Pride Day]] and were usually open, and busy, on public holidays such as [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] and [[Christmas]], when some gay men, particularly those who had been rejected by their families due to their [[sexual orientation]], had nowhere else to go. The American writer [[Truman Capote]] was a regular at New York City baths in the 1970s, in particular the sauna at West 58th Street.&lt;ref name=TGM&gt;{{harv|Kaiser|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another service offered by the baths was [[voting|voter registration]]. In the run-up to the [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980 election]], the [[New St. Mark's Baths]] in New York City, with the assistance of the [[League of Women Voters]], conducted a voter registration drive on its premises.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

In Australia, the first gay steam bath was opened in [[Sydney]] in 1967.

Gay [[saunas]], as they are more commonly known in Australia and New Zealand, were present in most large cities in those countries by the late 1980s. As homosexuality was [[Homosexual Law Reform Act 1986|decriminalised in New Zealand]] and [[LGBT rights in Australia#The gay rights movement|most Australian states]] during the 1970s and 1980s, there was no criminal conduct occurring on the premises of such "sex on site venues".

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]] gay saunas were routinely raided by police up until the end of the 1980s (for example raids in May 1988 on Brownies in [[Streatham]], the owner getting a six-month jail sentence and a £5,000 fine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Policing Gay Sex |journal=Gay Times |issue=138 |publisher=Millivres |date=March 1990 |issn=0950-6101}} 'The draconian sentence (six months jail and a £5,000 fine) on the owner and manager of Brownies sauna for keeping a [[disorderly house]] is a case in point'.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sauna owner appeals against prison sentence |journal=Gay Times |issue=127 |publisher=Millivres |date=April 1989 |issn=0950-6101 |quote=‘There was also’, he said, an ‘element of corruption’. ‘Anyone who came off the street merely to take a sauna&amp;#160;... would be able to see what was going on and be invited to take part. The possibilities are quite devastating and the sentence must demonstrate society’s shock and horror at what was going on.’}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Brooklyn House Hotel sauna in [[Manchester]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Christian sect joins police attack on gay sauna |journal=Gay Times |issue=117 |publisher=Millivres |date=June 1988 |issn=0950-6101}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CS286621807"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/keywordsearch.arc?queryKeywords=Raids+on+sauna+clubs |title=Raids on sauna clubs |work=The Times |date=15 March 1977 |last=Caswell |first=W.H. |page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, with increasing scrutiny of the costs of such operations (charges of [[Decency|gross indecency]] in a sauna normally needing the expense of undercover officers), a reduced likelihood of successful prosecution, concerns of being perceived as [[homophobic]], and little [[public interest]] in [[victimless crime]], gay saunas became free to operate without the risk of being raided by police. Also, police attitudes meant that they were more willing to turn a blind eye because they preferred such activity to take place in a contained environment rather than outdoors even though users were still committing the homosexual sexual offence of [[Labouchere Amendment|gross indecency]], until gross indecency was wiped from the statute books following the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]].

==Bathhouses today==
[[File:Sailors health club.jpg|thumb|Sailors leaflet in 1998]]

Gay bathhouses today continue to fill a similar function as they did historically. The community aspect has lessened in some territories, particularly those where gay men increasingly tend to [[Coming out|come out]].

Some men still use bathhouses as a convenient, safe place to meet other men for sex.&lt;ref&gt;"Guys Reveal Best.and Worst Bathhouse Experiences," ''[[Queerty]]'', February 7, 2016, https://www.queerty.com/guys-reveal-their-best-and-worst-bathhouse-experiences-20160207.&lt;/ref&gt; In areas where homosexuality is more accepted, safety may no longer be a primary attraction.

Many bathhouses are open twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. There is typically a single customer entrance and exit. After paying at the main entrance, the customer is buzzed through the main door. This system allows establishments to screen potential troublemakers; many bathhouses refuse entry to those who are visibly [[drunk|intoxicated]], as well as known prostitutes. In some areas, particularly where homosexuality is illegal, considered immoral, or viewed with hostility, this is a necessary safety precaution.

Sexual encounters at bathhouses are frequently, but not always, anonymous. Some feel that the anonymity adds to the erotic excitement: that is what, for these patrons, one goes to the bathhouse ''for''. Bathhouse encounters sometimes lead to relationships, but usually do not.&lt;ref name=Shneer2006&gt;{{citation |year=2006 |title=American queer, now and then |editor1=David Shneer |editor2=Caryn Aviv |publisher=Paradigm Publishers |isbn=9781594511714 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lATaAAAAMAAJ |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bathhouses are still used by [[men who have sex with men]] and do not identify as gay or [[bisexuality|bisexual]], including those that are closeted or in [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] relationships.

In many bathhouses the customer has a choice between renting a room or a locker, often for fixed periods of up to 12 hours. A room typically consists of a locker and a single bed (though doubles are sometimes available) with a thin vinyl mat supported on a simple wooden box or frame, an arrangement that facilitates easy cleaning between patrons. In many bathhouses (particularly those outside the United States), some or all of the rooms are freely available to all patrons.

Some bathhouses have areas designed to facilitate impersonal sex. These areas{{spnd}}rooms or hallways{{spnd}}are illuminated only by a (dim) red exit sign. It is possible to have sex, but not to see with whom. Other bathhouses, such as the [[Continental Baths]] in New York or the [[Club Baths]] in Washington, D.C., have two or more bunkbeds in close proximity, in a public area. This provides a place to have sex for those who could afford only a locker, and facilitated [[exhibitionism]] and [[voyeurism]] for those so inclined. Baths often have a (porn) TV room or snack bar where patrons can recuperate between orgasms.

Some men use the baths as a cheaper alternative to hotels,&lt;ref name="KLYT"&gt;{{cite news |title=Best Places To Get Serviced With Zeal And Abandon |work=LA Weekly (California) |date=October 8, 2004 |author1=Ron Athey |author2=Vaginal Davis |page=39 |quote=Have you noticed that besides the deluxe safe-sex kits, every sauna we've visited has an on-site clinic for counseling and disease testing? Hopefully, they'll survive the current wave of attacks. The real survivor is the KLYT, having stayed open for almost an entire century as the Palace Turkish Baths... Nowadays, the KLYT is sexual in the day and at night they rent all the rooms (which are really just cubicles) to the homeless, which at $11 is cheaper than a hotel.}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the limitations of being potentially crowded public venues with only rudimentary rooms and limited or non-existent pass out privileges.

Bathhouses are not always identifiable as such from the outside. Some bathhouses are clearly marked and well lit, others have no marking other than a street address on the door. Bathhouses sometimes display the [[Rainbow flag (gay movement)|rainbow flag]], which is commonly flown by businesses to identify themselves as gay-run or gay-friendly. Bathhouses commonly advertise widely in the [[gay press]] and sometimes advertise in mainstream newspapers and other media. In 2003 Australia began airing possibly the world's first [[television]] advertisements for a gay bathhouse when advertisements on [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial television]] in Melbourne promoted ''Wet on Wellington'', a sauna in [[Wellington Street, Collingwood|Wellington Street]], [[Collingwood, Victoria|Collingwood]].

In many countries, being identified in such a sauna was still viewed by the press as scandalous. In [[Ireland]] in November 1994, the ''Incognito'' sauna made mainstream press as the gay sauna where a priest had died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] and two other priests were on hand to help out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Priest's body lay undetected for over two hours on floor of gay club, Medical student tried to revive curate who is thought to have had heart attack |work=Irish Times |date=November 14, 1994 |author=Alison O'Connor |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scott Capurro]] is known for his deliberately provocative comedy material and often refers to [[gay sex]]ual culture including gay bathhouses.&lt;ref name="Capurro"&gt;{{cite news |title=The hate issue – London's Least Wanted; We asked you to tell us which Londoners or London institutions drove you round the twist and you replied with gusto. |work=Time Out |date=February 13, 2008 |author=Nina Caplan |quote='I hate groups of drunk blokes who behave like arseholes towards women.

I've gotten scabies there, THREE TIMES! And no, before you ask, it wasn't worth it.' Scott Capurro, comedian.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout and typical amenities==
On being buzzed in, the customer receives a towel (to wear, around the waist) and the key for his room or locker. The customer undresses, storing his clothing in the locker provided, and is then free to wander throughout the public areas of the bathhouse, which typically include the amenities of a traditional bathhouse or [[steambath]] ([[:it:File:Il bagno turco.JPG|Picture from the movie ''Hamam'']]).

Many bathhouses also provide free [[condoms]] and [[lubricant]].&lt;ref name=KLYT/&gt; Some establishments require a piece of identification or an item of value to be left with the front desk on entry. ''Homosexualities''&lt;ref name=Bell1979&gt;{{harv|Bell|1979|p=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized the importance of a towel: {{Quotation|Visiting a downtown gay bath was in many ways like revisiting a high-school gym – everyone wearing the same towel, in the same color, on the same part of the body. There was no status consciousness in the social-stratification sense; the towel or loincloth created a sort of equal-status social group.|a paragraph|Homosexualities, p239, 1979}}

Bathhouses are often designed with imagery and/or music to create surroundings that are arousing to the visitors.

Bathhouses are usually dimly lit and play music, although an outdoors, enclosed rooftop or pool area is not uncommon. They are often laid out in a manner that allows or encourages customers to wander throughout the establishment; a space laid out in this way is often referred to as a "maze".&lt;ref name="Woods GB"&gt;{{cite book |last=Woods |first=William J. |author2=Diane Binson |title=Gay Bathhouses and Public Health Policy |publisher=Haworth Press, {{ISBN|1560232730}} |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t2MsjlZT1LcC |accessdate=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some bathhouses have a space where random, anonymous sex is all that can occur. These spaces{{spnd}}rooms, hallways, or [[maze]]s, sometimes with [[glory hole (sexual slang)|glory holes]]{{spnd}}have as their only illumination a (dim) red "Exit" sign, so one can have sex but one cannot see with whom. Other clubs, such as the Continental Baths or the Club Baths of Washington, D.C., would have two or more bunk beds placed near each other, in a public area, thus providing a place to have sex for those who can afford only to rent a locker, and also maximizing the chances of being watched, for the [[exhibitionism|exhibitionists]] so inclined. Rooms are usually grouped together, as are lockers. Bathhouses are frequently decorated with posters of nude or semi-nude men, and sometimes explicit depictions of sex. It is not uncommon to see [[pornographic movie]]s playing on wall-mounted televisions throughout the bathhouse.

Most men typically just wear the towel provided. According to bathhouse etiquette, it is perfectly acceptable, even friendly, to put one's hand under someone else's towel to feel his penis, which, if well received, is the first step in sexual intimacy. Some bathhouses permit and others not only permit but encourage total nudity. In some bathhouses nudity is forbidden in the common areas of the establishments. Some men may wear underwear or [[Fetish clothes|fetish-wear]], but it is unusual for customers to remain fully or even partially dressed in street clothes. Bare feet are customary, though some men prefer to wear [[flip flops]] or [[sandals]], sometimes provided by the establishment, for foot protection. The room or locker key is usually suspended from an [[Rubber band|elastic band]] which can be worn around the wrist or ankle.&lt;ref name="Reynolds GM"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=Robert |author2=Gerard Sullivan |title=Gay Men's Sexual Stories: Getting It! |publisher=Haworth Press, {{ISBN|1560233192}} |year=2003 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o5-5kyZ94LgC |accessdate=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some bathhouses require customers to purchase yearly memberships and many offer special entry rates to members, students, military, or other groups.&lt;ref name="Woods GB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bedfellows PPS"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bedfellows |first=Dangerous |author2=Ephen Glenn Colter |author3=Wayne Hoffman |author4=Eva Pendleton |author5=Alison Redick |author6=David Serlin |title=Policing Public Sex: Queer Politics and the Future of AIDS Activism |publisher=South End Press Press, {{ISBN|089608549X}} |year=1996 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FqMoLytiNlUC |accessdate=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, bathhouses can restrict entrance to men of certain age ranges (apart from the general requirement of being an adult) or physical types, although in other places this would be considered illegal [[discrimination]]. Some bathhouses hold occasional "leather", "underwear", or other theme nights.

In the 1970s bathhouses began to install "fantasy environments" which recreated erotic situations that were illegal or dangerous:&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web |last=Coronado |first=Eddie |title=The history of gay bathhouses |publisher=Gaytubs.com |url=http://www.gaytubs.com/ahistory.htm |accessdate=23 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020010356/http://gaytubs.com/ahistory.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=20 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quotation|Orgy rooms . . . encouraged group sex, while glory holes recreated (public) toilets, and mazes took the place of bushes and undergrowth (in public parks).

==Etiquette==
Customers typically divide their time between the showers/saunas/jacuzzis and the main areas of the establishment. Customers who have rented rooms have free access to their room.

Customers who have rooms may leave their room doors open to signal that they are available for sex. An open door can also be an invitation for others to watch or join in sexual activity that is already occurring.

When a room is occupied only by a single person, some men will position themselves to suggest what they might like from someone joining them in the room: those who would like to be [[anal sex|penetrated anally]] ("bottoms") will sometimes lie face down on the bed with the door open, while those who prefer to penetrate others ("tops") or to receive [[fellatio]] might lie face up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/08.29.96/gay-bath-9635.html Both Sides Now]; Richard Sine; Metro: Silicon Valley's Weekly Newspaper; August 29&amp;#160;– September 4, 1996 issue. Retrieved 4 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, the baths served as community spaces for gay men. Even now, some men choose to go to the baths with their friends (even though they may not necessarily have sex with each other).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Chauncey|1995|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many men talk to each other at the baths, even forming long-lasting friendships or relationships, many others do not, preferring, for various reasons, anonymity.

In this highly sexualized environment a look or nod is frequently enough to express interest. In darkened areas of the establishment including the mazes, video rooms, group sex areas, and the saunas or hot tubs (but not generally in the showers, toilets, hallways, gyms, café areas, and lounges), men are usually free to touch other patrons; it is expected, and often welcomed. A shake of the head, or pushing away the other's hand, means that the attention is not welcomed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bathhouseblues.com/bathhouse_etiquette.html Bathhouse Etiquette].

Some establishments allow or encourage sex in specific group sex areas. In some jurisdictions such activity is prohibited, and sex must be confined to private rooms. Some forbid sex in pools for hygiene reasons. In the United Kingdom, the requirement is often set by the local authority's Environmental Health department{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}.

==High-risk behavior==

===Sexually transmitted diseases===
[[File:Pleasuredrome condoms.jpg|thumb|250px|Pleasuredrome condoms]]
From the mid-1980s onward there was lobbying against gay bathhouses blaming them for being a [[focus of infection]] encouraging the spread of [[sexually transmitted disease]]s (STDs), in particular [[HIV]], and this forced their closure in some jurisdictions (see Legal issues, below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/14/nyregion/bathhouses-reflect-aids-concerns.html |title=Bathhouses reflect AIDS concerns |work=The New York Times |date=October 14, 1985 |accessdate=26 December 2006 |last=Gross |first=Jane |quote=At the St. Marks Baths, for the price of a locker or a room, patrons now get a free condom, enclosed in a package that bears the legend ''the contents of this envelope could save your life.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Woods|Binson|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, fears about the spread of STDs have prompted the closing of bathhouses{{spnd}}with their private rooms{{spnd}}in favour of [[sex club]]s, in which all sexual activity takes place in the open, and can be observed by monitors whose job it is to enforce safe-sex practices. However, proponents of bathhouses point out that closing these facilities does not prevent people from engaging in unsafe sex.&lt;ref name="Woods GB"/&gt;

Neither the claim that bathhouses are responsible for the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, nor the claim that they are not, has been conclusively proved, but it is known that STDs are spread via [[unprotected sex]], and as part of their membership agreement, or as a condition of entry, some bathhouses now require customers to affirm in writing that they will only practice [[safe sex]] on the premises, and venues frequently provide free [[condom]]s, [[latex glove]]s, and [[sexual lubricant|lubrication]] (and/or have them available for purchase).&lt;ref name="Woods GB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richard Sine"&gt;{{cite web |last=Sine |first=Richard |title=Both Sides Now: The South Bay's only gay bathhouse profits while promoting protected sex. Bathhouse opponents wonder if casual sex can really be safe. |publisher=Metro Active |date=August 29, 1996 |url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/08.29.96/gay-bath-9635.html |accessdate=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand and Australia, the [http://www.nzaf.org.nz/ New Zealand AIDS Foundation] and constituent members of the [http://www.afao.org.au/ Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations] provide safe sex information for sex on site venue users.

Some anti-bathhouse activists argue that these measures are not enough, especially given that it is virtually impossible to monitor sexual activity in a bathhouse; however, while they acknowledge that closing gay bathhouses may force some men into unsafe or illegal situations in public parks and lavatories, they point out that they may be less likely to engage in anal or multipartner sex{{spnd}}both of which put participants at risk for contracting STDs{{spnd}}in such situations.&lt;ref&gt;Santana, Hedimo and Richters, Juliet: ''Sites of Sexual Activities among Men. Sex-on-premises venues in Sydney'', Monograph 5/1998, National Centre in HIV [[Social research]], Sydney&lt;/ref&gt;

Others counter these claims by pointing out that bathhouses are a major source of safer sex information{{spnd}}they provide pamphlets and post safer sex posters prominently (often on the walls of each room as well as in the common areas), provide free condoms and lubricants, and often require patrons to affirm that they will only have safer sex on the premises. In cities with larger gay populations, STD and [[HIV test]]ing and counseling may be offered on-site for no charge.&lt;ref name="Alex Westerfelt "&gt;{{cite web|last=Westerfelt |first=Alex |title=Bathhouse Norms: What goes on in the Bathhouse? |publisher=Healthy Living |date=August 2005 |url=http://www.4healthyliving.org/05aug.htm |accessdate=10 July 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305045451/http://4healthyliving.org/05aug.htm/ |archivedate=March 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharon Bernstein"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bernstein |first=Sharon |title=Rising Rate of HIV Infection Renews Bathhouse Debate |work=Los Angeles Times |date=March 23, 2004 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/23/local/me-bathhouse23 |accessdate=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-5752.html |title=NHS to hold STI testing in gay sauna |work=Pink News |date=October 15, 2007 |accessdate=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="QX758"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://viewer.zmags.com/showmag.php?mid=rqqwpg#/page44 |title=QX Magazine London Issue 758 |journal=QX Magazine London |issue=758 |date=September 17, 2009 |publisher=QX |page=44 |accessdate=25 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126013815/http://viewer.zmags.com/showmag.php?mid=rqqwpg#/page44 |archivedate=26 November 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drugs and alcohol===
In some countries bathhouses are prohibited from selling alcohol. (In Canada, where some bathhouses serve alcohol, a bathhouse holding a liquor license may be required to submit to liquor inspections, which activists claim are often a pretext for regulating gay sexual activity.) Many bathhouses deny entry to those who are visibly intoxicated but do not{{spnd}}or cannot{{spnd}}regulate the consumption of drugs (typically [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], [[poppers]], [[ecstasy (drug)|ecstasy]], [[cocaine]], and [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]]) by their patrons. The use of drugs and alcohol may make people more likely to engage in unsafe sex.&lt;ref name="Nichols MAA"&gt;{{cite book |last=Nichols |first=Eve K. |title=Mobilizing Against AIDS: The Authoritative Edition from the Institute of Medicine; Academy of Sciences |publisher=Harvard University Press; {{ISBN|0674577620}} |year=1989 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-h3_h0WK6QC |accessdate=10 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex clubs with no private areas potentially find it easier to regulate consumption of drugs on their premises.

The use of [[Methamphetamine|crystal meth]] is also known to lead to riskier sexual behaviour, but since gay crystal meth users tend to seek out other users to engage in sexual activity, they often prefer to make such arrangements via the internet.&lt;ref name="Honigsbaum2005"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/mar/26/aids.usa |title=Special report: West Side story: a tale of unprotected sex which could be link to new HIV superbug |work=The Observer |date=26 March 2005 |last=Honigsbaum |first=Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rowe2007&gt;{{cite web |title=Meth Use Among Gay Men Decreasing; Other Drug Use Holding Steady |last=Rowe |first=Aaron |date=26 July 2007 |publisher=Wired News |accessdate=22 October 2009 |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2007/07/meth-and-gay-se/ |quote=Researchers from the [[San Francisco]] Department of Public Health report that meth use among men who have sex with men has decreased over the past three years.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prostitution===
In some countries straight and gay bathhouses are used by [[rent boy]]s to find customers by offering massage services, the "complete service" is often used as a euphemism for sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Aggleton|1999|pp=116–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation |All interviewees were asked whether or not they used condoms, and all with the exception of Fabian, said they used them when having penetrative sex with clients.

; Toronto bathhouse raids of 1981
{{Main article|Operation Soap}}
: On February 5, 1981, 150 police raided four gay bathhouses in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]: the Club Baths, the ''Romans II Health and Recreation Spa'', the ''Richmond Street Health Emporium'', and ''The Barracks''. The ''Richmond Health Emporium'' was so badly damaged in the raid that it never reopened. Nicknamed ''Operation Soap'', the raid resulted in the arrests of 268 men. There was an immediate and angry response from both the gay and lesbian community and over 3,000 people gathered in protest. A second demonstration which took place on February 20, included over 4,000 people who gathered at Queen's Park and marched to Metro Toronto Police's 52 Division.&lt;ref name="Gulliver HA"/&gt;

===United States===
In [[California]] the "[[Consenting Adult Sex Bill]]", passed in January 1976, made gay bathhouses and the sex that took place within them legal for the first time. During the 1970s, the two most popular gay bathhouses in San Francisco, both located in the [[South of Market, San Francisco, California|SOMA]] neighborhood, were the ''Ritch Street Health Club'' at 330 Ritch St., the interior of which was designed like a [[Minoan palaces|Minoan palace]], and ''The Barracks'', a [[BDSM]] bathhouse at 72 Hallam near Folsom in which each room was designed to accommodate a different BDSM [[sexual fantasy]]. In 1978 a group of police officers raided the ''Liberty Baths'' in the [[Polk Gulch]] neighborhood of [[San Francisco]] and arrested three patrons for "lewd conduct in a public place", but the District Attorney's office soon dropped the charges against them.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; In 1984, however, fear of [[AIDS]] caused the [[San Francisco]] [[Health department]], with the support of some gay activists such as [[Randy Shilts]], and against the opposition of other gay activists, to ask the courts to close gay bathhouses in the city. The court, under Judge Roy Wonder, instead issued a [[court order]] that limited sexual practices and disallowed renting of private rooms in bathhouses, so that sexual activity could be monitored, as a public health measure. Some of the bathhouses tried to live within the strict rules of this court order, but many of them felt they could not easily do business under the new rules and closed. Eventually, the few remaining actual bathhouses succumbed to either economic pressures or the continuing legal pressures of the city and finally closed. Several sex clubs, which were not officially bathhouses, continued to operate indefinitely and operate to this day, though following strict rules under the court order and city regulations. Bathhouses themselves, however, operate just outside the city, thus outside of their laws, such as in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].

In 1985, the [[New York City]] Health Department ordered that the city's gay bathhouses be closed. As a result, heterosexual sex clubs such as [[Plato's Retreat]] had to shut down as well because the city had just passed a [[gay rights]] ordinance, and allowing the heterosexual clubs to remain open while closing the gay establishments would have been a violation of that ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wmob.com/artpages/platos1.html |title=Swinging doors shut: City probe KO's Plato's |work=Daily News |accessdate=8 November 2007 |last=Golubski |first=Suzanne |last2=Kappstatter |first2=Bob |location=New York |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927043031/http://www.wmob.com/artpages/platos1.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 2010 ten patrons and one employee were arrested during a [[police raid]] at Club Dallas in [[Texas]].  The patrons were charged with either [[public lewdness]] or [[indecent exposure]] while the employee was charged with interfering with the police. The [[Dallas Police Department]]'s liaison to the gay community stated that their actions were in response to a complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dallasvoice.com/11-arrested-raid-club-dallas-1048387.html|title=11 arrested in raid at Club Dallas|language=en-us|access-date=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- please check Continental Baths page before extending further --&gt;
Singer [[Bette Midler]] is well known for getting her start at the famous Continental Baths in New York City in the early 1970s, where she earned the nickname Bathhouse Betty. It was there, accompanied by pianist [[Barry Manilow]] (who, like the bathhouse patrons, sometimes wore only a white towel&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''The History of Gay Bathhouses.'' Online. Retrieved February 23, 2004. Available: {{cite web|url=http://www.gaytubs.com/ahistory.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 23, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020010356/http://gaytubs.com/ahistory.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=October 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), that she created her stage persona "the Divine Miss M."

On getting her start in bathhouses, Midler has remarked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite the way things turned out [with the AIDS crisis], I'm still proud of those days [when I got my start singing at the gay bathhouses]. I feel like I was at the forefront of the [[Gay Liberation|gay liberation movement]], and I hope I did my part to help it move forward. So, I kind of wear the label of 'Bathhouse Betty' with pride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.houstonvoice.com |title=Bette Midler |work=Houston Voice |date=October 23, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other famous performers who appeared at the Continental include [[Eleanor Steber]], [[Melba Moore]], [[Labelle]], [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]], [[Cab Calloway]], [[The Manhattan Transfer]], [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]], and [[Wayland Flowers]].{{cn|date=August 2017}}

The '''Graduate Management Admission Test''' ('''GMAT''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|iː|m|æ|t}} ({{respell|JEE|mat}}))) is a [[Computerized adaptive testing|computer adaptive test]] (CAT) intended to assess certain analytical, writing, quantitative, verbal, and reading skills in written English for use in admission to a graduate management program, such as an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/gmat/the-gmat-advantage.aspx|title=The GMAT Advantage}}&lt;/ref&gt; It requires knowledge of certain specific grammar and knowledge of certain specific algebra, geometry, and arithmetic. According to the test owning company, the [[Graduate Management Admission Council]] (GMAC), the GMAT assesses analytical writing and problem-solving abilities, while also addressing data sufficiency, logic, and critical reasoning skills that it believes to be vital to real-world business and management success.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/gmat/learn-about-the-gmat-exam.aspx|title=Learn About the GMAT Exam|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council(GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be taken up to five times a year.  Attempts must be at least 16 days apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.mba.com/us/frequently-asked-questions/gmat-exam-policies.aspx| title =GMAT Exam Policies| website =MBA.com| publisher =GMAC| access-date =March 8, 2016| quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GMAT is a registered trademark of the Graduate Management Admission Council. More than 7,000 programs at approximately 2,300 graduate business schools around the world accept the GMAT as part of the selection criteria for their programs. [[Business schools]] use the test as a criterion for admission into a wide range of graduate [[management]] programs, including [[MBA]], [[Master of Accountancy]], [[Master of Finance]] programs and others. The GMAT is administered in standardized test centers in 114 countries around the world.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; According to a survey conducted by Kaplan Test Prep, the GMAT is still the number one choice for MBA aspirants despite the increasing acceptability of [[Graduate Record Examinations|GRE]] scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-26/study-few-mba-applicants-consider-taking-the-gre |title=Study: Few MBA Applicants Consider Taking the GRE |author=Alison Damast |date=April 26, 2012 |publisher=Businessweek |accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to GMAC, it has continually performed validity studies to statistically verify that the exam predicts success in business school programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/gmat/about-the-gmat-exam/validity-reliability-fairness.aspx|title=Validity, Reliability and Fairness|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council(GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1953, the organization now called the [[Graduate Management Admission Council]] (GMAC) began as an association of nine [[business schools]], whose goal was to develop a standardized test to help business schools select qualified applicants. In the first year it was offered, the assessment (now known as the Graduate Management Admission Test), was taken just over 2,000 times; in recent years, it has been taken more than 230,000 times annually.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/why-gmac/gmac-interactive-map/gmac-statistics-video.aspx|title=GMAC Statistics Video|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504061935/http://www.gmac.com/why-gmac/gmac-interactive-map/gmac-statistics-video.aspx|archivedate=May 4, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially used in admissions by 54 schools, the test is now used by more than 7,000 programs at approximately 2,300 graduate business schools around the world.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; On June 5, 2012, GMAC introduced an integrated reasoning section to the exam that aims to measure a test taker’s ability to evaluate information presented in multiple formats from multiple sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing/integrated-reasoning.aspx | title =Integrated Reasoning Section | website =MBA.com | publisher =GMAC | access-date =March 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The intended purpose of the GMAT is to predict student success in graduate business programs.  According to GMAC, there is a .459 correlation (21% variance) between total GMAT scores and mid-program student grades based on data it collected between 1997 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmac.com/market-intelligence-and-research/research-library/validity-and-testing/research-reports-validity-related/gmat-validity-study-summary-report-for-1997-to-2004.aspx |title=GMAT Validity Study Summary Report for 1997 to 2004 |publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent research has shown significantly different results.  Independent research has shown that the GMAT can explain only 4.4% of the variance in final MBA GPA (Grade Point Average) while undergraduate GPA can explain 17.4% of the variance in final MBA GPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bedsole |first=Charles B. |url=https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/bedsole_charles_b_201312_edd.pdf |title=Apples to Apples?: Comparing the Predictive Validity of the GMAT and GRE for Business Schools and Building a Better Admissions Formula |publisher=University of Georgia. |date=December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, more recent independent research has shown that the GMAT does not add predictive validity after undergraduate GPA and work experience have been considered and that even undergraduate GPA alone can be used in lieu of considering the GMAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pratt |first=William R. |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08832323.2015.1027164 |title=Predicting MBA Student Success and Streamlining the Admissions Process |publisher=Journal of Education for Business |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format and timing==
The GMAT exam consists of four sections: an analytical writing assessment, an integrated reasoning section, a quantitative section, and a verbal section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=  https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/18/us/gmat-adds-new-thinking-cap.html?_r=1&amp;ref=education |title=GMAT Adds New Thinking Cap|publisher=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Total testing time is three hours and seven minutes. Test takers have 30 minutes for the analytical writing assessment and another 30 minutes to work through 12 questions, which often have multiple parts, on the integrated reasoning section and are given 62 minutes to work through 31 questions in the quantitative section and another 65 minutes to get through 36 questions in the verbal section.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Section !! Duration in minutes !! Number of questions
|-
| Analytical writing assessment || 30 || 1 essay
|-
| Integrated reasoning || 30 || 12
|-
| Quantitative || 62 || 31
|-
| Verbal || 65 || 36
|}

The quantitative and verbal sections of the GMAT exam are both multiple-choice and are administered in the computer-adaptive format, adjusting to a test taker’s level of ability. At the start of the quantitative and verbal sections, test takers are presented with a question of average difficulty. As questions are answered correctly, the computer presents the test taker with increasingly difficult questions and as questions are answered incorrectly the computer presents the test taker with questions of decreasing difficulty. This process continues until test takers complete each section, at which point the computer will have an accurate assessment of their ability level in that subject area and come up with a raw score for each section.

On July 11, 2017, the GMAC announced that from now on the order in which the different parts of the GMAT are taken can be chosen at the beginning of the exam.

Three options will be available at the test center:
* Analytical Writing Assessment, Integrated Reasoning, Quantitative, Verbal (original order)
* Verbal, Quantitative, Integrated Reasoning, Analytical Writing Assessment
* Quantitative, Verbal, Integrated Reasoning, Analytical Writing Assessment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing.aspx|title=GMAT changes order of sections.|last=|first=|date=|website=GMAT Exam Format and Timing|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2018, the GMAC officially shortened the test by half an hour, shortening the verbal and quant sections from 75 minutes each to 65 and 62 minutes, respectively, and shortening some of the instruction screens.

===Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA)===
The AWA consists of one 30-minute writing task—analysis of an argument. It is important to be able to analyze the reasoning behind a given argument and write a critique of that argument. The essay will be given two independent ratings and these ratings are averaged together to determine the test taker's AWA score. One rating is given by a computerized reading evaluation and another is given by a person at GMAC who will read and score the essay themselves without knowledge of what the computerized score was. The automated essay-scoring engine is an electronic system that evaluates more than 50 structural and linguistic features, including organization of ideas, syntactic variety, and topical analysis. If the two ratings differ by more than one point, another evaluation by an expert reader is required to resolve the discrepancy and determine the final score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.gmac.com/gmat/understand-gmat-exam-scores/how-to-use-the-analytical-writing-assessment-score.aspx |title=How to use the Analytical Writing Assessment Score|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analytical writing assessment is graded on a scale of 0 (minimum) to 6 (maximum) in half-point intervals (a score of zero means the answer was gibberish or obviously not written on the assigned topic or the test taker failed to write anything at all on the AWA).

===Integrated reasoning===
Integrated Reasoning (IR) is a section introduced in June 2012 and is designed to measure a test taker’s ability to evaluate data presented in multiple formats from multiple sources. The skills being tested by the integrated reasoning section were identified in a survey of 740 management faculty worldwide as important for today’s incoming students.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-05-21/the-new-gmat-gets-put-to-the-test|title=The GMAT gets put to the Test|publisher=Business Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; The integrated reasoning section consists of 12 questions (which often consist of multiple parts themselves) in four different formats: graphics interpretation, two-part analysis, table analysis, and multi-source reasoning. Integrated reasoning scores range from 1 to 8. Like the Analytical Writing Assessment (AWA), this section is scored separately from the quantitative and verbal section. Performance on the IR and AWA sections do not contribute to the total GMAT score.

The integrated reasoning section includes four question types: table analysis, graphics interpretation, multi-source reasoning, and two-part analysis.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; In the table analysis section, test takers are presented with a sortable table of information, similar to a spreadsheet, which has to be analyzed. Each question will have several statements with opposite-answer options (e.g., true/false, yes/no), and test takers click on the correct option. Graphics interpretation questions ask test takers to interpret a graph or graphical image. Each question has fill-in-the-blank statements with pull-down menus; test takers must choose the options that make the statements accurate. Multi-source reasoning questions are accompanied by two to three sources of information presented on tabbed pages. Test takers click on the tabs and examine all the relevant information, which may be a combination of text, charts, and tables to answer either traditional multiple-choice or opposite-answer (e.g., yes/no, true/false) questions. Two-part analysis questions involve two components for a solution. Possible answers are given in a table format with a column for each component and rows with possible options. Test takers have to choose one response per column.

===Quantitative section===
The quantitative section of the GMAT seeks to measure the ability to reason quantitatively, solve quantitative problems, interpret graphic data, and analyze and use information given in a problem. Questions require knowledge of certain algebra, geometry, and arithmetic. There are two types of quantitative questions: problem solving and data sufficiency. The use of calculators is not allowed on the quantitative section of the GMAT. Test takers must do their math work out by hand using a wet erase pen and laminated graph paper which are given to them at the testing center.  Scores range from 0 to 60, although GMAC only reports scores between 6 and 51.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence|first=Rudner|title=Demystifying the GMAT: Scale Scores|url=http://www.gmac.com/~/media/Files/gmac/Research/validity-and-testing/demystifyingthegmat_scalescores.pdf|publisher=GMAC|accessdate=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problem solving questions are designed to test the ability to reason quantitatively and to solve quantitative problems. Data sufficiency is a question type unique to the GMAT designed to measure the ability to understand and analyze a quantitative problem, recognize what information is relevant or irrelevant and determine at what point there is enough information to solve a problem or recognize the fact that there is insufficient information given to solve a particular problem.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/the-gmat/gmat-scores-and-score-reports/understanding-your-score-report.aspx|title=Understanding Your Score Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verbal section===
The verbal section of the GMAT exam includes the following question types: reading comprehension, critical reasoning, and sentence correction. Each question type gives five answer options from which to select. Verbal scores range from 0 to 60; however, scores below 9 or above 44 are rare.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

According to GMAC, the reading comprehension question type tests ability to analyze information and draw a conclusion. Reading comprehension passages can be anywhere from one to several paragraphs long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing/verbal/sample-reading-comprehension-question.aspx | title =Sample Reading Comprehension Question | website =MBA.com | publisher =Graduate Management Admission Council | access-date =March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to GMAC, the critical reasoning question type assesses reasoning skills.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing/verbal/sample-critical-reasoning-question.aspx | title =Sample Critical Reasoning Question | website =MBA.com | publisher =Graduate Management Admission Council | access-date =March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to GMAC, the sentence correction question type tests grammar and effective communication skills. From the available answer options, the test taker should select the most effective construction that best expresses the intent of the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-blog-hub/the-official-gmat-blog/2011/sep/idioms-sentence-correction-and-the-gmat-exam.aspx|title=Idioms, Sentence Correction, and the GMAT Exam|work=The Official GMAT Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-format-timing/verbal/sample-sentence-correction-question.aspx|title=Sample Sentence Correction Question|work=The Official GMAT Web Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring==
The total GMAT score ranges from 200 to 800 and measures performance on the quantitative and verbal sections together (performance on the AWA and IR sections do not count toward the total score, those sections are scored separately). Scores are given in increments of 10 (e.g. 540, 550, 560, 570, etc.).

The score distribution conforms to a [[Normal distribution|bell curve]] with a [[standard deviation]] of approximately 120 points, meaning that about 68% of examinees score between 430 and 670.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; More precisely, over the three-year period 2014--2017 the mean score was 556.04 with a standard deviation of 120.45 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/the-gmat/gmat-scores-and-score-reports/what-your-percentile-ranking-means.aspx|title=What Your Percentile Ranking Means. Retrieved October 5th, 2017.|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final score is not based solely on the last question the examinee answers (i.e. the level of difficulty of questions reached through the computer adaptive presentation of questions). The algorithm used to build a score is more complicated than that. The examinee can make a mistake and answer incorrectly and the computer will recognize that item as an anomaly. If the examinee misses the first question his score will not necessarily fall in the bottom half of the range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Talento-Miller|first1=Eileen|title=The CAT in the GMAT|url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-blog-hub/the-official-gmat-blog/2010/jan/the-cat-in-the-gmat.aspx|website=MBA.com|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council|accessdate=November 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After previewing his/her unofficial GMAT score, a GMAT test taker has two minutes to decide whether to keep or cancel a GMAT score at the test center.  A test taker can also cancel a score online within the 72 hours after the scheduled exam start time.  A cancelled score can be reinstated for 4 years and 11 months after the date of the test for a fee of $50.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/us/frequently-asked-questions/gmat-scores-and-score-reports.aspx|website=MBA.com|title=GMAT Scores and Score Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scheduling and preparing for the exam==
Test takers may register for the GMAT either online at mba.com or by calling one of the test centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mba.com/the-gmat/schedule-a-gmat-appointment/scheduling-information.aspx|title=Scheduling Information|publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council(GMAC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; To schedule an exam, an appointment must be made at one of the designated test centers. The GMAT may not be taken more than once within 16 days but no more than five times in a rolling 12-month period and no more than eight times total, even if the scores are canceled. Official GMAT exam study materials are available on the mba.com online store and through third-party vendors. The cost of the exam is $250. All applicants are required to present valid ID when taking the test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/prepare-for-the-gmat-exam/plan-for-test-day/presenting-proper-identification.aspx |title=Presenting proper Identification}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion of the test, test takers have the option of canceling or reporting their scores.  As of July 2014, test takers were allowed to view their score before making this decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mba.com/us/the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-scoring/your-score-report/preview-your-gmat-score.aspx |title=Preview Your GMAT Score  |accessdate=January 15, 2015 |publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are [[test preparation]] companies that offer GMAT courses. Other available test preparation resources include university text books, GMAT preparation books, sample tests, and free web resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmac.com/reach-and-recruit-students/prepare-candidates-for-the-exam-classroom.aspx| |title=Prepare Candidates for the GMAT® Exam &amp; the Classroom |publisher=Graduate Management Admission Council |accessdate=November 26, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== GMAT Waiver ==
In order to effectively evaluate all candidates, some graduate schools offer GMAT Waivers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/articles/2017-06-05/what-mba-applicants-should-know-about-test-waivers-test-optional-programs|title=What MBA Applicants Should Know|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A GMAT waiver is designed for working professionals who have multiple years of experience and would like to forego taking the GMAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://onlinebusiness.syr.edu/mba/gmat-waiver-policy/|title=Why Our Online MBA Doesn't Require the GMAT I MBA@Syracuse GMAT Waiver Policy|access-date=2018-06-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If requesting a GMAT waiver, you must include a letter with your professional experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mastersportal.com/articles/2205/4-easy-steps-to-get-a-gmat-waiver.html|title=4 Easy Steps to Get a GMAT Waiver - MastersPortal.com|website=www.mastersportal.com|access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programs evaluate GMAT waivers on a case-by-case basis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2232">In [[telecommunications]], '''insertion loss''' is the loss of [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] [[power (physics)|power]] resulting from the insertion of a device in a [[transmission line]] or [[optical fiber]] and is usually expressed in [[decibel]]s (dB).  

If the power transmitted to the load before insertion is ''P''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; and the power received by the load after insertion is ''P''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;, then the insertion loss in dB is given by,

:&lt;math&gt;IL(\mathrm{dB}) = 10 \log_{10} {P_\mathrm T \over P_\mathrm R}&lt;/math&gt;

==Electronic filters==

Insertion loss is a [[figure of merit]] for an [[electronic filter]] and this data is generally specified with a filter.  Insertion loss is defined as a ratio of the signal level in a test configuration without the filter installed (|''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|) to the signal level with the filter installed  (|''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|).  This ratio is described in [[decibel|dB]] by the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Insertion loss (dB)} = 10 \log_{10} {\left|V_1\right|^2 \over \left|V_2\right|^2} = 20 \log_{10} {\left|V_1\right| \over \left|V_2\right|}&lt;/math&gt;

For passive filters, |''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;| will be smaller than |''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;|. In this case, the insertion loss is positive and measures how much smaller the signal is after adding the filter.

==Link with scattering parameters==

In case the two measurement ports use the same reference impedance, the insertion loss (&lt;math&gt;IL&lt;/math&gt;) is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;Pozar, David M.; ''Microwave Engineering, Third Edition''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collin, Robert E.; ''Foundations For Microwave Engineering, Second Edition''&lt;/ref&gt; 

:&lt;math&gt; IL = -20\log_{10}\left|S_{21}\right| \,\text{dB}&lt;/math&gt;.

Here &lt;math&gt;S_{21}&lt;/math&gt; is one of the [[Scattering parameters#Insertion loss|scattering parameters]]. Insertion loss is the extra loss produced by the introduction of the [[Device under test|DUT]] between the 2 reference planes of the measurement. The extra loss can be introduced by intrinsic loss in the DUT and/or mismatch. In case of extra loss the insertion loss is defined to be positive.

The '''Institute of Mathematical Sciences''' (Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas – ICMAT) is a mixed institute belonging to the Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones, [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]]) together with three [[Madrid]] universities: the Autonomous University of Madrid ([[Universidad Autónoma de Madrid]], UAM), the Carlos III University of Madrid ([[Universidad Carlos III de Madrid]], UC3M) and the Complutense University of Madrid ([[Universidad Complutense de Madrid]], UCM). The ICMAT headquarters is located in a new building on the UAM [[Cantoblanco]] campus ([[Madrid]], [[Spain]]).

The ICMAT is composed of the mathematicians belonging to the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] and researchers from the three Madrid universities. The structure and composition of the center was based on an initial selection carried out with the assistance of the National Agency for Public Education ([[Agencia Nacional de Evaluación y Prospectiva]] – ANEP) after a public call issued to all interested parties.

==Research at the ICMAT==
The ICMAT is an institute where work on a broad range of mathematics is conducted, including the transfer of knowledge and results. Initially the main fields of research are as follows: [[Mathematical Analysis]], [[Differential Geometry]], [[Algebraic Geometry]], [[Partial Differential Equations]], [[Fluid Mechanics]], [[Dynamical Systems]], [[Geometric Mechanics]] and [[Mathematical Physics]]. In addition to the inclusion of research lines in [[Number Theory]], [[Group Theory]] and [[Combinatorics]] in 2011.

Among the research results obtained by researchers from the Institute that have so far had the greatest impact, it is worth mentioning the [solution to the Nash problem in Singularity Theory http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2012/176-3/p11] by Javier Fernández de Bobadilla and María Pe; the [solution to the Sidon problem in Number Theory by Javier Cilleruelo and Carlos Vinuesa https://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.5024.pdf]; the [solution to the Arnold conjecture in Hydrodynamics http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2012/175-1/p09] by Daniel Peralta Salas and Alberto Enciso; the [construction of the mathematical model for explaining how water waves break http://www.pnas.org/content/109/3/733.short] by the research team led by Diego Córdoba, and the recent results on [Lagrangian transport and their applications to the study of the ozone layer http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JAS-D-12-0274.1] by the team led by Ana María Mancho.

== History of the ICMAT ==

=== Background to the ICMAT ===

The ICMAT emerged from the Department of Mathematics at the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] [[Institute of Mathematics and Fundamental Physics]], to which mathematicians belonging to the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] were assigned. The agreement for the creation of the center was signed in November, 2007, after assessment through the 2006–2009 Strategic Plan, to which all the centers connected with the CSIC are subject and in which the international commission recommended the establishment of a separate institute.

A look back over the long history of the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] reveals what may be regarded as forerunners of the ICMAT: the Laboratorio Seminario Matemático of the [[Junta de Ampliación de Estudios]] (JAE) created in 1915, and the [[Instituto Jorge Juan de Matemáticas]], created in 1939 by the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]].

=== The ICMAT, Severo Ochoa Center of Excellence ===

In 2011 the ICMAT was chosen as one of the eight centers of excellence in the [[Severo Ochoa Program]] call for submissions issued by the then [[Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology]] (MICYT).

Among other distinctions, six ICMAT researchers have obtained [[European Research Council]] (ERC) [[Starting Grants]], which places the Institute in the foremost position in Europe in mathematics.

== Outreach at the ICMAT ==

Every year the ICMAT participates in the [[Science and Technology Week]], the [[Science in Action (competition)|Science in Action]] competition (the ICMAT being one of the organizing institutions) and since 2012 has participated in [[Researchers’ Night]] (in collaboration with the UAM).

Furthermore, the ICMAT has launched the Matemáticas en la Residencia program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmat.es/press%20outreach/outreach/MathResidence |title=Mathematics at the Residencia &amp;#124; Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas |publisher=Icmat.es |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in collaboration with the [[Residencia de Estudiantes]] and the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]]) in which international figures for the public understanding of science such as [[Marcus du Sautoy]], [[Jesús María Sanz-Serna]], [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]], [[Guillermo Martínez (writer)|Guillermo Martínez]], [[Edward Frenkel]], [[Christiane Rousseau]], [[Antonio Durán]] and [[John Allen Paulos]] have taken part, as well as the Graffiti and Maths competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmat.es/press%20outreach/outreach/GraffitiMaths |title=Grafiti y Matemáticas &amp;#124; Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas |publisher=Icmat.es |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is aimed at secondary school students. The blog Mathematics and its Frontiers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madrimasd.org/blogs/matematicas/ |title=Matemáticas y sus fronteras |publisher=Madrimasd.org |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; has an annual readership of 150,000, in addition to the presence of the Institute in social networks: Facebook &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Instituto-de-Ciencias-Matem%C3%A1ticas-ICMAT/317339304969896 |title=Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas (ICMAT) |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Twitter. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/_ICMAT |title=Inst Cc. Matemáticas (_ICMAT) on Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2013-07-31 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, 2013, the ICMAT officially became a Scientific Culture Unit recognized by the [[FECYT]] (Spanish Foundation for Science and Technology), and is the only mathematical institution to enjoy this distinction.

== Location and facilities ==

=== ICMAT facilities ===

The ICMAT is located in a new building on the UAM campus and has one auditorium with a capacity for 270 people, a lecture hall that holds 140 and another that holds 80, as well as three more with a capacity of 50, 40 and 30 people, respectively. It also has a library of 1,100 square meters, a large computation area and offices for some 200 researchers. 
These facilities are ideal for the celebration of thematic programs, congresses, schools and seminars.

=== The ICMAT on the UAM+CSIC International Campus of Excellence ===

The ICMAT forms part of the Theoretical Physics and Mathematics strategic axis on the [[UAM+CSIC International Campus of Excellence]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15683">'''Interactive machine translation''' ('''IMT'''), is a specific sub-field of [[computer-aided translation]]. Under this [[translation]] paradigm, the [[computer software]] that assists the human translator attempts to predict the text the user is going to input by taking into account all the information it has available. Whenever such prediction is wrong and the user provides [[feedback]] to the system, a new prediction is performed considering the new information available. Such process is repeated until the translation provided matches the  user's expectations.

Interactive machine translation is specially interesting when [[translation|translating]] texts in domains where it is not admissible to output a translation containing errors, hence requiring a human user to amend the translations provided by the system.  In such cases, interactive machine translation has been proved to provide benefit to potential users.&lt;ref name="Casacuberta 2009"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Nevertheless, there are few [[commercial software]] that implements interactive machine translation and work done in the field is mostly restrained to [[academic research]].

== History ==

Historically, interactive machine translation is born as an evolution of the [[computer-aided translation]] paradigm, where the human translator and the machine translation system were intended to work as a [[tandem]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |last1=Foster |first1=George |last2=Isabelle |first2=Pierre |last3=Plamondon |first3=Pierre
               |year=1997 |title=Target-text mediated interactive machine translation
               |journal=Machine Translation |volume=12 |issue=1 |pages=175–194
               |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/xu9r6752215w9275/fulltext.pdf |doi=10.1023/a:1007999327580}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
This first work was extended within the TransType research project, funded by the Canadian government. In this project, the [[Human–computer interaction|human interaction]] was aimed towards producing the target text for the first time by embedding data-driven [[machine translation]] techniques within the interactive translation environment with the goal of achieving the best of both actors: the efficiency of the automatic system and the reliability of human translators.

Later, a larger-scale research project, TransType2,&lt;ref name="Casacuberta 2009" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="Barrachina 2009" /&gt; funded by the [[European Commission]] extended such work by analyzing the incorporation of a complete  [[machine translation system]] into the process, with the goal of producing a complete translation hypothesis, which the human user is allowed to amend or accept. If the user decides to amend the hypothesis, the system then attempts to make the best use of such [[feedback]] in order to produce a new translation hypothesis that takes into account the modifications introduced by the user.

More recently, CASMACAT,&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; also funded by the [[European Commission]], aimed at developing novel types of assistance to human translators and integrated them into a new workbench, consisting of an editor, a server, and analysis and visualisation tools. The workbench was designed in a modular fashion and can be combined with existing computer aided translation tools. Furthermore, the CASMACAT workbench can learn from the interaction with the human translator by updating and adapting its models instantly based on the translation choices of the user.&lt;ref&gt;

Recent work on involving an extensive evaluation with human users&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite conference |url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N/N10/N10-1078.pdf
      |title=Enabling Monolingual Translators: Post-Editing vs. Options

&lt;/ref&gt; revealed the fact that interactive machine translation may even be used by users that do not speak the source language in order to achieve near professional translation quality. Moreover, it also elucidated the fact that an interactive scenario is more beneficial than a classic post-edition scenario.

The previously described approaches rely on a tightly coupled underlying corpus-based machine translation system (usually, a [[Statistical machine translation]] system) that is used as a [[White_box_(software_engineering)|glass box]], therefore inheriting the [[Statistical machine translation#Shortcomings|shortcomings of the translation systems]] and limiting the usage of interactive machine translation for some scenarios. For this reason, an approach that uses any kind of bilingual resource (not limited to machine translation) as a [[black-box]] to provide interactive machine translation was developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W14-0309

      |booktitle=Proceedings of the EACL 2014 Workshop on Humans and Computer-assisted Translation}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is not able to extract as much information from the bilingual resources used, due to the black-box nature of the interaction, but can use any resource available to the user. Forecat is a black-box interactive machine translation implementation that is available both as a web application (that includes a webpage and a web services interface) and as a plugin for [[OmegaT]] (Forecat-OmegaT).

== Process ==

The interactive machine translation process starts with the system suggesting a
translation hypothesis to the user. Then, the user may accept the complete
sentence as correct, or may modify it if he considers there is some error.
Typically, when modifying a given word, it is assumed that the prefix until
that word is correct, leading to a left-to-right interaction scheme. Once the
user has changed the word considered incorrect, the system then proposes a new
suffix, i.e. the remainder of the sentence. Such process continues until the
translation provided satisfies the user.

Although explained at the word level, the previous process may also be implemented at the character level, and hence the system provides a suffix whenever the human translator types in a single character. In addition, there is ongoing effort towards changing the typical left-to-right interaction scheme in order to make [[human-machine interaction]] easier.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar approach is used in the [[Caitra]] translation tool.

== Evaluation ==

Evaluation is a difficult issue in interactive machine translation. Ideally,
evaluation should take place in experiments involving human users. However,
given the high monetary cost this would imply, this is seldom the case.
Moreover, even when considering human translators in order to perform a true
evaluation of interactive machine translation techniques, it is not clear what
should be measured in such experiments, since there are many different
variables that should be taken into account and cannot be controlled, as is 
for instance the time the user takes in order to get used to the process.
In the CASMACAT project, some field trials have been carried out to study some of these variables.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

For quick evaluations in laboratory conditions, interactive machine translation is measured by using the ''key stroke ratio'' or the ''word stroke ratio''. Such criteria attempt to measure how many key-strokes  or words did the user need to introduce before producing the final translated  document.&lt;ref name="Barrachina 2009" /&gt;

== Differences with classical computer-aided translation ==
Although interactive machine translation is a sub-field of [[computer-aided translation]], the main attractive of the former with respect to the latter is the interactivity. In classical computer-aided translation, the translation system may suggest one translation hypothesis in the best case, and then the user is required to [[postediting|post-edit]] such hypothesis. In contrast, in interactive machine translation the system produces a new translation hypothesis each time the user interacts with the system, i.e. after each word (or letter) has been introduced.

'''Mainland''' is a [[Geographic contiguity|contiguous]] [[landmass]] that is larger and often [[human geography|politically, economically and/or demographically]] more significant than [[political geography|politically associated]] [[Outlying territory|remote territories]], such as [[exclaves]] or [[oceanic islands]] situated outside the [[continental shelf]]. 

In geography, "mainland" can denote the [[continent]]al (i.e. non-insular) part of any [[polity]] or the main island within an [[island nation]]. In [[geopolitics]], "mainland" is sometimes used interchangeably with terms like [[Metropolis#Metropolis as a mainland area|Metropole]] as an antonym to [[overseas territories]]. In the sense of "[[wikt:heartland|heartland]]", mainland is the opposite of [[wikt:periphery|periphery]].

The term is relative- in [[Tasmania]], continental [[Australia]] is the mainland, while to residents of [[Flinders Island]], the main island of Tasmania is also "the mainland".

[[HRH Prince Michael of Kent]] is the charity's royal patron.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100924233848/http://www.princemichael.org.uk/charities/maritime/] HRH Prince Michael of Kent GCVO, KStJ&lt;/ref&gt;

==National level==
[[File:New HQ.jpg|thumb|right|The MVS Headquarters (MVS HQ) are based in Warrington at the International Business Centre.]]
At a National level the MVS Headquarters (MVS HQ) are based in [[Warrington]] at the International Business Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mvs.org.uk/news/new-mvs-hq-warrington MVS opens new national HQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150128115715/http://www.mvs.org.uk/news/new-mvs-hq-warrington |date=28 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

All decisions on policy or national regulation are formulated by the directors and trustees.

Under the stewardship of chairman David Hughes,they also oversee the governance of the charitable aspects of the MVS.
 
The MVS is headed operationally by the Chief Volunteer Officer (CVO) who is also the chair of the Committee of Management (CoM).

CoM also takes the reports of the national managers and coordinators, including:

•	MVS Training Manager: Responsible for all  training matters.

•	MVS Resilience Manager: Responsible for liaison nationally and regionally to develop and implement resilience strategies and co-ordinate efforts in community support.

==History of the Service==
[[File:RNLI Exercise 03.jpg|thumb|right|The MVS and RNLI on a joint exercise in Sussex.]]
The MVS was formed on 1 April 1994, a day after the [[Royal Naval Auxiliary Service]] was disbanded.

The RNXS operated small ships such as fleet tenders and inshore minesweepers and ran Naval Control of Shipping centres ashore but was disbanded following the end of the Cold War.

While many of the best aspects of RNXS operating procedures and traditions survive in the MVS, it is emphatically a civilian, but uniformed, charity whose vessels fly a defaced Red Ensign.

However constructive links with the [[Royal Navy]] continue at many levels, including University RN Units.

There are many ex-RN members in the MVS, and more are always welcome.

Over the years MVS volunteers have achieved much.

Among the many occasions when they made a difference was during the MSC Napoli salvage when the MVS played a significant role ashore and afloat and was commended by the then SOSREP, Robin Middleton.

More recently the MVS had a supporting role during the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].

Its London Units were involved in an extended deployment as part of the Environment Agency's security operation for the Olympic Rowing and Kayak Sprint events held at Eton Dorney Lake.

The City of London Unit's Nelson 45 launch, Londinium 1 and three RIBs were based at Boveney Lock on the Non-tidal Thames for two weeks.

The MVS craft had the privilege of being invited to take part in celebratory processions for Team GB's many gold medal winners down the river, from the Olympic Venue to Team GB's riverside hotel.

The MVS also assisted Weymouth Harbour Authority during the Olympics.

Poole Unit's ex-Customs launch Avocet, and RIBS from Portsmouth, Christchurch, Bournemouth, Weymouth and Portland Units worked to the Weymouth Harbour Master's instructions, patrolling the port's busy anchorages and approaches.

The MVS's national training vessel East Sussex 1 sailed to Weymouth to act as a floating hotel and control centre for the crews of the other craft.

The MVS's work supporting the Olympics was one of the major factors that led to it receiving the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Volunteering Award 2012.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvs.org.uk/queens-diamond-jubilee-volunteering-award-2012 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213015440/http://www.mvs.org.uk/queens-diamond-jubilee-volunteering-award-2012 |archivedate=13 December 2014 |df= }} Maritime Volunteer Services recognised at St. James Palace&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maritime Volunteer Service has around 400 members in 27 units around the United Kingdom.

Most units meet weekly for training, which is put into practice afloat using a range of craft including RIBs, launches, dories, and the national training vessel East Sussex 1.

The MVS maintains strong links with local authorities, harbour boards and other maritime organisations.

In 2014 the MVS marked its 20th Anniversary at an official dinner in Portsmouth, where the guest of honour was Vice-Admiral Sir Alan Massey KCB, CBE, RN Chief Executive of the MCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvs.org.uk/news/mvs-20th-anniversary-speech-sir-alan-massey |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119183432/http://www.mvs.org.uk/news/mvs-20th-anniversary-speech-sir-alan-massey |archivedate=19 January 2015 |df= }} MCA Chief Executive guest of honour at MVS 20th Anniversary Dinner&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
On 7 May 1997, the then Armed Forces Minister, Dr John Reid, announced during a visit to the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth that the Royal Navy would give formal recognition to the Maritime Volunteer Service.

In his remarks, he said that the Royal Navy's recognition is a tribute to the important role that the MVS play in the education and training of young people in nautical skills. 
&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980507/text/80507w04.htm Formal Recognition], publications.parliament.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016 the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Philip Jones KCB ADC issued a new Defence Instruction and Notice again recognising the MVS.

==The Defaced Ensign==
[[File:0005 Defaced Red Ensign.jpg|thumb|right|The MVS Defaced Ensign]]
On 2 September 1998, a Warrant was issued giving permission for the MVS to wear a Red Ensign bearing the Service's "V" and "Anchor" logo and naval crown.

The logo was designed by Commander Bruce Nicholls OBE RN, and this is only the thirty-fifth designed Red Ensign approved for use worldwide.

Of that total six are flown by UK public institutions such as Trinity House, the RNLI and the Scout Association, six by dependent territories and five by Commonwealth countries and provinces.

The remainder have been granted to privileged yacht clubs around the world.

The MVS Ensign accurately reflects the Service's aims in promoting maritime skills amongst local communities in ports and harbours around Britain's coast.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb~mvs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims &amp; Objectives==
The MVS objects are:

To advance the education and training of the members of the charity and the general public in all aspects of maritime and communication skills and knowledge.

The protection and preservation of life and property primarily, but not exclusively, within the maritime environment.

==Training==
Each member is issued an individual training log book and members can train in variety of RYA courses including:

•	RYA Basic Navigation and Safety Course

•	RYA Day Skipper Theory Course

•	RYA Coastal Skipper / Yachtmaster Offshore Theory Course

•	RYA Diesel Engine Course

•	RYA Marine Radio Short Range Certificate Course

•	RYA First Aid

Members can also train with materials produced by the MVS covering:

•	Safety at Sea

•	Operation of Inboard and Outboard Motors

•	Boat Handling

•	Vessel Repair and Maintenance

•	Chart Work and Navigation including use of navigation equipment

•	Emergency Response such as pollution, incidents and afloat patrols

•	Operations room skills including Command and Control

•	Use of meteorological information

•	Operation of craft electrical systems including fault diagnosis and rectification

•	Large craft engines and auxiliary systems

•	Control of berthing and berthing parties

•	Small ship command and handling

•	Deck and Engineering watch keeping

Members progress through the various levels in their own time dependent on the amount of time they can commit to their training.

==Future==
Looking to the future, the MVS intend to continue to change lives both for the “Maritime Volunteer” and for their local community.

'''Marston Mat''', properly  '''pierced''' (or '''perforated''') '''steel planking (PSP)''', is standardized, perforated steel [[mat]]ting material developed by the [[United States]] at the [[Waterways Experiment Station]] shortly before [[World War II]], primarily for the rapid construction of temporary runways and landing strips (also misspelled as '''Marsden matting'''). The nickname came from [[Marston, North Carolina]], adjacent to [[Camp Mackall]] airfield where the material was first used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mathis|first1=S. J.|title=Mat "Seabees are Wizards at Building Battle-Front Air Bases|journal=Aviation Week|date=March 1943|volume=43|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:Marsden matting Alexai Point Attu Island Alaska.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A section of Marston Mat used to construct the [[Alexai Point Landing Field]] in 1943, [[Attu Island]], Alaska, c. 2006]]
Pierced(Pressed, Steel Planking, named after the manufacturing process) steel planking consisted of steel strips with punched [[lightening holes]] in it. These holes were in rows, and a formation of ''U''-shaped channels between the holes. Hooks were formed along one long edge and slots along the other long edge so that adjacent mats could be connected. The short edges were cut straight with no holes or hooks. To achieve lengthwise interlocking, the mats were laid in a staggered pattern.

The hooks were usually held in the slots by a steel clip that filled the part of the slot that is empty when the adjacent sheets are properly engaged. The holes were bent up at their edges so that the beveled edge stiffened the area around the hole. In some mats a ''T''-shaped stake could be driven at intervals through the holes to keep the assembly in place on the ground. Sometimes the sheets were welded together.

A typical later PSP was the M8 landing mat. A single piece weighed about 66 pounds and was {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|15|in|m|abbr=on}} wide. The hole pattern for the sheet was three holes wide by 29 holes long, resulting in 87 holes per mat.

The M9 mat, made from aluminum, was produced to allow easier transportation by aircraft, since it weighed about two-thirds as much. Aluminum plank was referred to as PAP, for perforated aluminum planking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mechanicalmetals.com/perforatedmetals.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612045658/http://www.mechanicalmetals.com/perforatedmetals.html |archivedate=2011-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was and is not as common. Aluminum was a controlled [[strategic material]] during World War II, so much less was made; it was typically only able to handle half as many loading cycles as steel, and its high scrap value and short usable life led to recycling rather than reuse.

After the war, PSP was used by many southeastern U.S. auto racing teams, since it was manufactured in the area, and available from many abandoned military airfields. It was also used during a similar period when NASCAR teams used car trailers.

==History==

===World War II===
[[File:AWM 026647 P-40 Milne.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk]] piloted by Squadron Leader Keith "Bluey" Truscott of [[No. 76 Squadron RAAF]] taxiing along Marston Mat at [[Milne Bay]], [[Papua New Guinea]] in September 1942]]
Marston Mat was extensively used during [[World War II]] by Army engineers and [[Seabee (US Navy)|Seabee]]s (construction battalions) to build [[runway]]s and other readily usable surfaces over all kinds of terrain. An early in-theater use of PSP was in constructing a 5,000 foot runway on Greenland's 'Bluie West One' (BW-1), an Allied Ferry Command and U.S.A.A.F airfield located on the extreme southwest corner of Greenland, at the termination of Eriksfjord, and near the coastal community of [[Narsarsuaq]].  Construction began in early fall 1941, and the first aircraft landed on Jan 24, 1942. Deemed a success, it was then used extensively in the Pacific Theater of Operations.  A [[C-47 Skytrain]] supply aircraft was the first plane to land on the first steel-mat runway constructed in France after the [[invasion of Normandy]].&lt;ref name=Gurney&gt;{{Cite document |last=Gurney |first=Gene (Major, USAF) |year=1962 |title=The War in the Air: a pictorial history of World War II Air Forces in Combat |location=New York City  |publisher=Bonanza Books |page=175 |quote=U.S. Air Force photo |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Pacific islands the matting was typically covered with crushed and rolled [[coral]] or soil to form a level surface. The perforated and channeled design of the matting created strength and rigidity and facilitated drainage. A runway two hundred feet wide and 5000 feet (1500 m) long could be created within two days by a small team of engineers.

===Berlin Airlift===
At the start of the [[Berlin Airlift]] the runways at [[Tempelhof Airport]] in the US Zone of Berlin were made of PSP. Designed to support fighters and smaller cargo aircraft, the [[Douglas C-54 Skymaster]] that formed the backbone of the U.S. effort was too heavy for the PSP. Berliners were hired to fix the runway between the three-minute arrivals, running onto the runways with bags of sand to dump onto the mats and soften the surface.

===Vietnam era===
With the deployment of jet aircraft and helicopters, [[foreign object damage]] (FOD) became a larger hazard. In moist tropical areas, such as Vietnam, vegetation growing through the mats also became an issue. Jet blast or rotor downdraft could stir up loose materials on the ground, which might then be sucked into jet inlets, and vegetation required mowing or herbicides. The M8A1 mat was developed to prevent this, omitting the pierced holes that exposed the soil beneath.&lt;ref name="Calumet, Runway mats" &gt;{{Cite web | title=Portable Runways Using Landing Mats | url=http://www.calumetindustries.com/?page_id=174 | website=Calumet Industries}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mat has a solid surface, strengthened by corrugations that also encouraged the drainage of rainwater. The mat size also changed to be {{convert|22|x|144|inch}}.

Later mats were developed in a lightweight aluminum version, {{convert|24|x|144|inch}}.&lt;ref name="Calumet, Runway mats" /&gt; This was made as a hollow extrusion, rather than pressed. Aluminum matting allows greater quantities to be airlifted. Its greater scrap value encourages theft, so steel is preferred for larger or long-term installations.

Landing mats of all types were widely used for construction of bunker roofs and for reinforcing field fortifications, as well as service roads inside fire support bases.

===Legacy===
[[File:MarsdenMattingRepurposed.jpg|thumb|right|Marston Mat repurposed for storage of empty wine bottles on a farm in Normandy in 2007. Hooks and slots along long edges clearly visible]]
[[File:Marston mat re-purposed as fencing in the philippines.jpg|thumb|right|A huge quantity of Marston matting was left in the Philippines by the U.S. forces after World War II. Many of these were re-purposed as fencing material in housing projects that were built after the war. This one, behind the little boy, is located in a housing development in the 1950s that was initially referred to as "Project One", but later came to be known as Kamuning, Quezon City, near Manila. Photo is dated May 1965.]]
Large quantities of matting were produced; approximately 2 million tons costing more than US$200 million (in the 1940s).&lt;ref name="ace"&gt;[http://140.194.76.129/publications/eng-pamphlets/ep870-1-42/c-3-4.pdf U.S. Army Corps of Engineers article on Landing Mat Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724120156/http://140.194.76.129/publications/eng-pamphlets/ep870-1-42/c-3-4.pdf |date=2009-07-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the war a large amount of the material remained as [[war surplus]] and was pressed into use in various civil engineering applications such as road and bridge construction. As they were made from steel with a high [[manganese]] content, the matting was also highly resistant to corrosion.&lt;ref&gt;[[Manganese#Metal alloy|Manganese alloy properties]]&lt;/ref&gt; In various countries located in the [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]], particularly in the Philippines and Papua New Guinea, matting still remains in use as fencing&lt;ref&gt;[http://tarawatheaftermath.com/Photos27.html Tarawa Photos]&lt;/ref&gt; or roadway barriers, in some cases stretching for miles.

Surplus sections of Vietnam War-era mats were used to construct fences along the U.S.-Mexico border in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Carcamo |first1=Cindy |title=Border wall built in 1990s cut illegal immigration, but it also brought problems for small town |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-jacumba-border-fence-20180309-htmlstory.html |accessdate=2 June 2018 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ISBN|0791457850}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]] group of multiple [[universe]]s including the universe in which we live. Together, these universes comprise everything that exists: the entirety of [[space]], [[time]], [[matter]], [[energy]], the [[physical law]]s and the [[Physical constant|constants]] that describe them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Planck/Planck_reveals_an_almost_perfect_Universe "Planck reveals an almost perfect Universe"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2013/03/Planck_CMB "Space in Images"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.si.edu/sisearch/search-all-else?edan_q=multiple%2Buniverses "Multiple universes"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=multiple+universes+principle&amp;btnG=&amp;as_sdt=1%2C14&amp;as_sdtp=&amp;oq=multiple+universes "Multiple universes principle"].&lt;/ref&gt; The different universes within the multiverse are called "parallel universes", "other universes", or "alternative universes".&lt;ref&gt;[https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap101114.html "Multiverses: Do Other Universes Exist?"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170401.html "Split the Universe"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/sunearth/news/mag-portals.html "Hidden Portals in Earth's Magnetic Field"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the concept ==
In his book, ''[[Opticks]]'' (1704), [[Isaac Newton]] suggested the idea of a multiverse:&lt;ref name="Opticks"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newton|first1=Isaac|title=Opticks|publisher=Project Gutenberg|pages=403–404|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/33504}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; And since Space is divisible in infinitum, and Matter is not necessarily in all places, it may be also allow'd that God is able to create Particles of Matter of several Sizes and Figures, and in several Proportions to Space, and perhaps of different Densities and Forces, and thereby to vary the Laws of Nature, and make Worlds of several sorts in several Parts of the Universe. At least, I see nothing of Contradiction in all this.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[Dublin]] in 1952, [[Erwin Schrödinger]] gave a lecture in which he jocularly warned his audience that what he was about to say might "seem lunatic". He said that when his equations seemed to describe several different histories, these were "not alternatives, but all really happen simultaneously".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/9188438/Erwin-Schrodinger-and-the-Quantum-Revolution-by-John-Gribbin-review.html "Erwin Schrödinger and the Quantum Revolution by John Gribbin: review"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief explanation ==
The structure of the multiverse, the nature of each universe within it, and the relationships among these universes vary from one multiverse theory to another.

Multiple universes have been hypothesized in [[cosmology]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[religion]], [[philosophy]], [[transpersonal psychology]], and [[literature]], particularly in [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]]. In these contexts, parallel universes are also called "alternate universes", "quantum universes", "interpenetrating dimensions", "parallel dimensions", "parallel worlds", "parallel realities", "quantum realities", "alternate realities", "[[alternate timeline]]s", "alternate dimensions" and "dimensional planes".

The physics community has debated the various multiverse theories over time. Prominent physicists are divided about whether any other universes exist outside of our own.

Some physicists say the multiverse is not a legitimate topic of scientific inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00033790903047725| title = Contemporary History of Cosmology and the Controversy over the Multiverse| journal = Annals of Science| volume = 66| issue = 4| pages = 529–551| year = 2009| last1 = Kragh | first1 = H. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Concerns have been raised about whether attempts to exempt the multiverse from experimental verification could erode public confidence in science and ultimately damage the study of fundamental physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.nature.com/news/scientific-method-defend-the-integrity-of-physics-1.16535 |title= Scientific Method: Defend the Integrity of Physics |last1= Ellis  |first1= George |last2=Silk |first2=Joe |date=16 December 2014   |journal= Nature |publisher=  |location=  |issn= |oclc= |doi=10.1038/516321a |volume=516 |issue= 7531 |pages=321–323|bibcode = 2014Natur.516..321E |pmid=25519115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have argued that the multiverse is a [[philosophical]] rather than a [[Hypothesis|scientific hypothesis]] because it cannot be [[falsifiability|falsified]]. The ability to disprove a theory by means of scientific experiment has always been part of the accepted [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="Richard P.

In 2007, Nobel laureate [[Steven Weinberg]] suggested that if the multiverse existed, "the hope of finding a rational explanation for the precise values of quark masses and other constants of the standard model that we observe in our [[Big Bang]] is doomed, for their values would be an accident of the particular part of the multiverse in which we live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2013/nov/07/physics-what-we-do-and-dont-know/|title= Physics: What we do and don't know  |last1= Weinberg  |first1= Steven |date= 20 November 2007 |magazine= The New York Review of Books |publisher=  |location= |issn= |oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments against multiverse theories ==
In his 2003 ''New York Times'' opinion piece, "A Brief History of the Multiverse", author and cosmologist [[Paul Davies]] offered a variety of arguments that multiverse theories are non-scientific:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=''A Brief History of the Multiverse'' |first=Paul |last=Davies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/12/opinion/a-brief-history-of-the-multiverse.html?pagewanted=all |newspaper=New York Times |date=12 April 2003 |accessdate=16 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quotation|For a start, how is the existence of the other universes to be tested? To be sure, all cosmologists accept that there are some regions of the universe that lie beyond the reach of our telescopes, but somewhere on the slippery slope between that and the idea that there are an infinite number of universes, credibility reaches a limit. As one slips down that slope, more and more must be accepted on faith, and less and less is open to scientific verification. Extreme multiverse explanations are therefore reminiscent of theological discussions. Indeed, invoking an infinity of unseen universes to explain the unusual features of the one we do see is just as ad hoc as invoking an unseen Creator. The multiverse theory may be dressed up in scientific language, but in essence it requires the same leap of faith.|Paul Davies|''[[The New York Times]]''|"A Brief History of the Multiverse"}}

[[George F. R. Ellis|George Ellis]], writing in August 2011, provided a criticism of the multiverse, and pointed out that it is not a traditional scientific theory. He accepts that the multiverse is thought to exist far beyond the [[List of cosmological horizons|cosmological horizon]]. He emphasized that it is theorized to be so far away that it is unlikely any evidence will ever be found. Ellis also explained that some theorists do not believe the lack of [[Empiricism|empirical]] [[testability]] [[falsifiability]] is a major concern, but he is opposed to that line of thinking: {{quotation|Many physicists who talk about the multiverse, especially advocates of the [[string landscape]], do not care much about parallel universes per se. For them, objections to the multiverse as a concept are unimportant. Their theories live or die based on internal consistency and, one hopes, eventual laboratory testing.}}

Ellis says that scientists have proposed the idea of the multiverse as a way of explaining the nature of [[existence]]. He points out that it ultimately leaves those questions unresolved because it is a [[metaphysical]] issue that cannot be resolved by empirical science. He argues that observational testing is at the core of science and should not be abandoned:&lt;ref name="SciAmer-9723382"&gt;{{cite magazine |first=George F.

== Classification schemes ==
[[Max Tegmark]] and [[Brian Greene]] have devised classification schemes for the various theoretical types of multiverses and universes that they might comprise.

=== Max Tegmark's four levels ===
{{anchor|Tegmark's classification}}
[[Cosmology|Cosmologist]] [[Max Tegmark]] has provided a [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] of universes beyond the familiar [[observable universe]]. The four levels of Tegmark's classification are arranged such that subsequent levels can be understood to encompass and expand upon previous levels. They are briefly described below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | first=Max| last=Tegmark| magazine=Scientific American|date=May 2003| title=Parallel Universes| doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0503-40| volume=288| pages=40–51| pmid=12701329| url=http://cds.cern.ch/record/604580|arxiv = astro-ph/0302131 |bibcode = 2003SciAm.288e..40T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==== Level I: An extension of our Universe ====
A prediction of [[chaotic inflation]] is the existence of an infinite [[ergodic hypothesis|ergodic]] universe, which, being infinite, must contain [[Hubble volume]]s realizing all initial conditions.

Accordingly, an infinite universe will contain an infinite number of Hubble volumes, all having the same [[physical law]]s and [[physical constant]]s. In regard to configurations such as the distribution of [[matter]], almost all will differ from our Hubble volume. However, because there are infinitely many, far beyond the [[cosmological horizon]], there will eventually be Hubble volumes with similar, and even identical, configurations. Tegmark estimates that an identical volume to ours should be about [[Double exponential function|10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]] meters away from us.&lt;ref name="X0302131"/&gt;

Given infinite space, there would, in fact, be an infinite number of Hubble volumes identical to ours in the universe.&lt;ref name="TegmarkPUstaple"&gt;"Parallel universes. Not just a staple of science fiction, other universes are a direct implication of cosmological observations.", Tegmark M., Sci Am. 2003 May;288(5):40–51.&lt;/ref&gt; This follows directly from the [[cosmological principle]], wherein it is assumed that our Hubble volume is not special or unique.

==== Level II: Universes with different physical constants ====
[[File:Multiverse - level II.svg|thumb|[[Eternal inflation|Bubble universes]] – every disk represents a bubble universe. Our universe is represented by one of the disks.&lt;br&gt;Universe 1 to Universe 6 represent bubble universes. Five of them have different [[physical constant]]s than our universe has.]]
In the [[Eternal inflation|chaotic inflation]] theory, which is a variant of the [[Inflation (cosmology)|cosmic inflation]] theory, the multiverse or space as a whole is stretching and will continue doing so forever,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |title=[[How the Universe Works#Season 3|How The Universe Works 3]]|episode=First Second of the Big Bang |network=[[Science (TV network)|Discovery Science]] |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some regions of space stop stretching and form distinct bubbles (like gas pockets in a loaf of rising bread). Such bubbles are embryonic level I multiverses.

Different bubbles may experience different [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]], which results in different properties, such as different [[physical constant]]s.&lt;ref name="TegmarkPUstaple"/&gt;

Level II also includes [[John Archibald Wheeler]]'s [[oscillatory universe]] theory and [[Lee Smolin]]'s [[fecund universes theory]].

==== Level III: Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics ====
[[Hugh Everett III]]'s [[many-worlds interpretation]] (MWI) is one of several mainstream [[interpretations of quantum mechanics]].

In brief, one aspect of quantum mechanics is that certain observations cannot be predicted absolutely. Instead, there is a range of possible observations, each with a different [[probability]]. According to the MWI, each of these possible observations corresponds to a different universe. Suppose a six-sided {{dice|die}} is thrown and that the result of the throw corresponds to a quantum mechanics [[observable]]. All six possible ways the die can fall correspond to six different universes.

Tegmark argues that a Level III multiverse does not contain more possibilities in the Hubble volume than a Level I or Level II multiverse. In effect, all the different "worlds" created by "splits" in a Level III multiverse with the same physical constants can be found in some Hubble volume in a Level I multiverse. Tegmark writes that, "The only difference between Level I and Level III is where your [[doppelgänger]]s reside. In Level I they live elsewhere in good old three-dimensional space. In Level III they live on another quantum branch in infinite-dimensional [[Hilbert space]]."

Similarly, all Level II bubble universes with different physical constants can, in effect, be found as "worlds" created by "splits" at the moment of spontaneous symmetry breaking in a Level III multiverse.&lt;ref name="TegmarkPUstaple"/&gt; According to [[Yasunori Nomura]],&lt;ref name="Nomura"/&gt; [[Raphael Bousso]], and [[Leonard Susskind]],&lt;ref name="BoussoSusskind"/&gt; this is because global spacetime appearing in the (eternally) inflating multiverse is a redundant concept. This implies that the multiverses of Levels I, II, and III are, in fact, the same thing. This hypothesis is referred to as "Multiverse = Quantum Many Worlds".

Related to the ''many-worlds'' idea are [[Richard Feynman]]'s ''[[multiple histories]]'' interpretation and [[H. Dieter Zeh]]'s [[many-minds interpretation|''many-minds'' interpretation]].

==== Level IV: Ultimate ensemble ====
The ultimate [[mathematical universe hypothesis]] is Tegmark's own hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Tegmark2014"&gt;{{cite book |first=Max |last=Tegmark |date=2014 |title=[[Our Mathematical Universe: My Quest for the Ultimate Nature of Reality]] |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |isbn=9780307599803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This level considers all universes to be equally real which can be described by different mathematical structures.

Tegmark writes: {{quotation|[[Abstract mathematics]] is so general that any [[theory of everything|Theory Of Everything (TOE)]] which is definable in purely formal terms (independent of vague human terminology) is also a mathematical structure. For instance, a TOE involving a set of different types of entities (denoted by words, say) and relations between them (denoted by additional words) is nothing but what mathematicians call a [[Set theory|set-theoretical]] model, and one can generally find a [[formal system]] that it is a model of.}}

He argues that this "implies that any conceivable parallel universe theory can be described at Level IV" and "subsumes all other ensembles, therefore brings closure to the hierarchy of multiverses, and there cannot be, say, a Level V."&lt;ref name="X0302131"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tegmark |first=Max |arxiv=astro-ph/0302131 |title=Parallel Universes |journal=In "Science and Ultimate Reality: from Quantum to Cosmos", honoring John Wheeler's th birthday.

[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]], however, says that the set of mathematical structures is not even [[well-defined]] and that it admits only universe representations describable by [[constructive mathematics]]—that is, [[computer programs]].

Schmidhuber explicitly includes universe representations describable by non-halting programs whose output bits converge after finite time, although the convergence time itself may not be predictable by a halting program, due to the [[Undecidable problem|undecidability]] of the [[halting problem]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J.

=== Brian Greene's nine types ===
{{anchor|Brian Greene's nine types of multiverses}}
The American [[theoretical physicist]] and [[Super-string theory|string theorist]] [[Brian Greene]] discussed nine types of multiverses:&lt;ref&gt;In [[The Hidden Reality: Parallel Universes and the Deep Laws of the Cosmos]], 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Quilted ====
The quilted multiverse works only in an [[infinity|infinite]] universe. With an infinite amount of space, every possible event will occur an infinite number of times. However, the speed of light prevents us from being aware of these other identical areas.

==== Inflationary ====
The [[Eternal inflation|inflationary multiverse]] is composed of various pockets in which inflation fields collapse and form new universes.

==== Brane ====
The [[Brane cosmology|brane multiverse]] version postulates that our entire universe exists on a membrane ([[Brane multiverse|brane]]) which floats in a higher dimension or "bulk". In this bulk, there are other membranes with their own universes. These universes can interact with one another, and when they collide, the violence and energy produced is more than enough to give rise to a [[Big Bang|big bang]]. The branes float or drift near each other in the bulk, and every few trillion years, attracted by gravity or some other force we do not understand, collide and bang into each other. This repeated contact gives rise to multiple or "cyclic" [[Big Bang|big bangs]]. This particular hypothesis falls under the string theory umbrella as it requires extra spatial dimensions.

==== Cyclic ====
The [[cyclic model|cyclic multiverse]] has multiple [[brane]]s that have collided, causing [[Big Bang]]s. The universes bounce back and pass through time until they are pulled back together and again collide, destroying the old contents and creating them anew.

==== Landscape ====
The [[String theory landscape|landscape multiverse]] relies on string theory's [[Calabi–Yau manifold|Calabi–Yau]] spaces. Quantum fluctuations drop the shapes to a lower energy level, creating a pocket with a set of laws different from that of the surrounding space.

==== Quantum ====
The [[Many-worlds interpretation|quantum multiverse]] creates a new universe when a diversion in events occurs, as in the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of quantum mechanics.

==== Holographic ====
The [[Holographic principle|holographic multiverse]] is derived from the theory that the surface area of a space can simulate the volume of the region.

==== Simulated ====
The [[Simulated reality|simulated multiverse]] exists on complex computer systems that simulate entire universes.

==== Ultimate ====
The [[Mathematical universe hypothesis|ultimate multiverse]] contains every mathematically possible universe under different laws of physics.

=== Cyclic theories ===
{{main|Cyclic model}}
In several theories, there is a series of infinite, self-sustaining cycles (for example, an [[eternity]] of [[Big Bang]]s, [[Big Crunch]]es, and/or [[Big Freeze]]s).

== M-theory ==
{{see also|Introduction to M-theory|M-theory|Brane cosmology|String theory landscape}}
A multiverse of a somewhat different kind has been envisaged within [[string theory]] and its higher-dimensional extension, [[Introduction to M-theory|M-theory.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=hep-th/0511037v1|last1=Weinberg|first1=Steven|title=Living in the Multiverse|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These theories require the presence of 10 or 11 spacetime dimensions respectively. The extra 6 or 7 dimensions may either be compactified on a very small scale, or our universe may simply be localized on a dynamical (3+1)-dimensional object, a [[D3-brane]]. This opens up the possibility that there are other [[brane]]s which could support other universes.&lt;ref name="Richard J Szabo 2004"&gt;Richard J Szabo, ''An introduction to string theory and D-brane dynamics'' (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maurizio Gasperini 2007"&gt;Maurizio Gasperini, ''Elements of String Cosmology'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Black-hole cosmology ==
{{main|Black-hole cosmology}}
Black-hole [[Physical cosmology|cosmology]] is a cosmological model in which the [[observable universe]] is the interior of a [[black hole]] existing as one of possibly many universes inside a larger universe.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} This includes the theory of [[white hole]]s, which are on the opposite side of [[space-time]].

== Anthropic principle ==
{{main|Anthropic principle}}
The concept of other universes has been proposed to explain how our [[Observable universe|own universe]] appears to be [[Fine-tuned Universe|fine-tuned]] for [[Consciousness|conscious life]] as we experience it.

If there were a large (possibly infinite) number of universes, each with possibly different physical laws (or different [[dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constants]]), then some of these universes (even if very few) would have the combination of laws and fundamental parameters that are suitable for the development of [[matter]], astronomical structures, elemental diversity, stars, and planets that can exist long enough for life to emerge and evolve.

The [[weak anthropic principle]] could then be applied to conclude that we (as conscious beings) would only exist in one of those few universes that [[Selection bias|happened to be]] finely tuned, permitting the existence of life with developed consciousness. Thus, while the probability might be extremely small that any particular universe would have the requisite conditions for life ([[Carbon chauvinism|as we understand life]]), those conditions do not require [[intelligent design]] as an explanation for the conditions in the Universe that promote our existence in it.

An early form of this reasoning is evident in [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s 1844 work "Von der Nichtigkeit und dem Leiden des Lebens", where he argues that our world must be the worst of all possible worlds, because if it were significantly worse in any respect it could not continue to exist.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, "Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung," supplement to the 4th book "Von der Nichtigkeit und dem Leiden des Lebens". see also R.B. Haldane and J. Kemp's translation [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_World_as_Will_and_Representation/Supplements_to_the_Fourth_Book "On the Vanity and Suffering of Life"] pp 395-6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occam's razor ==
Proponents and critics disagree about how to apply [[Occam's razor]]. Critics argue that to postulate an almost infinite number of unobservable universes, just to explain our own universe, is contrary to [[Occam's razor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Trinh |first= Xuan Thuan |title= Science &amp; the Search for Meaning: Perspectives from International Scientists |editor= Staune, Jean |publisher= [[Templeton Foundation]] |location= West Conshohocken, PA |page= 186 |isbn= 1-59947-102-7 |date= 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, proponents argue that in terms of [[Kolmogorov complexity]] the proposed multiverse is simpler than a single idiosyncratic universe.&lt;ref name="TegmarkPUstaple"/&gt;

For example, multiverse proponent [[Max Tegmark]] argues: {{quotation|[A]n entire [[Statistical ensemble (mathematical physics)|ensemble]] is often much simpler than one of its members. This principle can be stated more formally using the notion of [[algorithmic information]] content. The algorithmic information content in a number is, roughly speaking, the length of the shortest computer program that will produce that number as output. For example, consider the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of all [[integer]]s. Which is simpler, the whole set or just one number? Naively, you might think that a single number is simpler, but the entire set can be generated by quite a trivial computer program, whereas a single number can be hugely long. Therefore, the whole set is actually simpler... (Similarly), the higher-level multiverses are simpler. Going from our universe to the Level I multiverse eliminates the need to specify [[initial condition]]s, upgrading to Level II eliminates the need to specify [[physical constants]], and the Level IV multiverse eliminates the need to specify anything at all... A common feature of all four multiverse levels is that the simplest and arguably most elegant theory involves parallel universes by default. To deny the existence of those universes, one needs to complicate the theory by adding experimentally unsupported processes and ad hoc postulates: [[finite space]], [[Wavefunction collapse|wave function collapse]] and ontological asymmetry. Our judgment therefore comes down to which we find more wasteful and inelegant: many worlds or many words. Perhaps we will gradually get used to the weird ways of our cosmos and find its strangeness to be part of its charm.&lt;ref name="TegmarkPUstaple"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | last1 = | first1 =  | date = May 2003 | title = Parallel universes.

== Modal realism ==
[[Possible world]]s are a way of explaining probability and hypothetical statements. Some philosophers, such as [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], believe that all possible worlds exist and that they are just as real as the world we live in (a position known as [[modal realism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:''For the Japanese aerospace laboratory, see [[National Aerospace Laboratory of Japan]], for the Indian aerospace laboratory, see [[National Aerospace Laboratories]] of India''

The '''Netherlands Aerospace Centre''' (NLR) (former Nationaal Lucht- en Ruimtevaartlaboratorium)  is the National Aerospace Laboratory of the [[Netherlands]] and is one of its major technological institutes. These institutes perform a large part of the applied research in the Netherlands, each within its own specific field of technology. As an independent [[non-profit organisation]], the NLR is the aerospace-knowledge enterprise in the Netherlands and provides high-quality technical support to the aerospace sector (NLR is [[ISO 9000|ISO 9001:2000]]/AQAP-110 certified).

==Organisation==

NLR's activities are market-oriented, independent, socially relevant and without profit priority. By acting so, NLR can adequately respond to the need for scientific knowledge and technology in the field of aviation and space travel, which arises from the government, public and industry. Thus being the natural partner for aerospace research.
Work under research contracts (national and international, government and industry) amounts to 75 percent of NLR's activities, the remaining 25 percent is funded by the Dutch government for basic demand-oriented research programmes and development of research equipment. Depending on the project and the customer's preferences, NLR acts as a sole contractor or as a subcontractor co-operating with other institutes or partners from industry.
Research and development work is carried out on a project basis with great synergy between divisions and departments. Strong emphasis is laid on a customer oriented approach.

==History==

The RSL, the predecessor of NLR, was officially founded on 5 April 1919, shortly after the [[First World War]]. Although air power did not play a decisive role during this war, [[aeronautics]] had nevertheless progressed very rapidly during that period.
Aeronautics developed slowly in the Netherlands during the first two decades of this century when compared to the neighbouring countries, as for example France.
After the [[Armistice]], 11 November 1918, the aeronautical community started to concentrate on the application of the newly obtained skills and experience. The Government appointed a committee to review the possibilities of aerial applications. The year 1919 saw many new initiatives.
On Saturday 5 April 1919 (when Saturday was a normal working day), the new Laboratory of the RSL was officially opened in the presence of representatives of the Government in a building at the Navy Yard in [[Amsterdam]]. However, at this official opening there was already a laboratory in operation. The laboratory RSL was given an excellent start, although the human and material resources were limited.

In his opening speech Prof. L.A. van Royen emphasized that the RSL should develop free and open communications with the aeronautical world and in turn the RSL should be assisted to come into contact with those who are interested in the activities of RSL. The interested parts should also be able to influence the activities of RSL.
The RSL was originated at offices belonging to the Ministry of Defence mainly as a result of the aviation activities of the Army (since 1913) and the Navy (since 1917). The groundwork for the foundation of RSL started during World War I in 1917, when civil aviation in the Netherlands was non-existent. On 1 January 1920 the RSL was transfer from the Ministry of Defence to the Ministry of Public Works because after the war the defence spending was cut drastically and [[civil aviation]] appeared in the horizon.
As early as 1922, the Minister of Public Works proposed to terminate RSL. The main argument was that the annual funding was considered extravagant. Fortunately nothing happened immediately and the dispute continued for many years.
When in 1918 the RSL was planned, the location at the Navy Yard in Amsterdam was meant as a temporary site only. Prof. van Royen intended to establish a permanent laboratory in Delft, in close association with Delft University of Technology ([[TU Delft]]). However, the university apparently was not too eager to accommodate the RSL, probably because of the problems encountered in the 1920s after the RSL became part of the Ministry of Public Works. Also, flight testing had become an important part of the activities and several people felt that a location close to [[Schiphol]] and [[Fokker]] was more important than being close to TU Delft.
The RSL essentially developed along the lines as planned during 1918-1919, till it was converted in the independent Foundation NLL in 1937. The only major change in its formal task took place when a separate Department of Civil Aviation (RLD) was created to supervise [[airworthiness]] and aircraft operations in the Netherlands. However this did not have much effect on the technical content of the work of the RSL; it was a separation of responsibilities. This shift of responsibilities was related to the desire of the aircraft industry in the 1930s to have a national laboratory to which all interested parts would have access on an equal basis, according to Ir. A.J. Marx.

The centre piece of the laboratory was an Eiffel type [[wind tunnel]]. The construction of the wind tunnel was complicated because with only limited information available, Dr. Ir. E.B. Wolff managed to produce an operational tunnel by March 1919 and it was shown at the official opening of the RSL.

The tunnel – essentially a pipe with two open ends – had the air drawn from the room in which the tunnel was placed and it was exhausted into that same room at the other end. It must be assumed that he decided on an Eiffel type tunnel because of the size and limitations of the building and on the results published by Eiffel. Through this arrangement he achieved at least a facility of reasonable size and [[Reynolds Number]]. The tunnel had an open test section and, with a maximum power of 30 [[Horsepower]], the mean velocity at the 1.6 meter diameter test section was 25&amp;nbsp;m/s. However, the uniformity of the flow across the test section was quite unsatisfactory and large fluctuations in time occurred.
After investigations of the flow in the wind tunnel, several modifications were introduced. The result was that by July 1920 a fairly uniform and steady air flow of about 35&amp;nbsp;m/s in the test section was obtained. This tunnel was used extensively for a period of 20 years for a variety of aeronautical and non-aeronautical tests and, apart from smaller research facilities which were built at TU Delft, it was the only wind tunnel available for aeronautical development in the Netherlands till 1940.
In the meantime Wolff and Koning carried out studies for new wind tunnel facilities. As a result, two closed type wind tunnels were built in the new laboratory at Sloterweg in Amsterdam that became fully operational in 1940. One was the LST 3 x 2 m² which was large enough to simulate powered aircraft flight and a smaller, the LST 1.5 x 1.5 m² tunnel for research purposes and non-aeronautical wind tunnel testing. They were the main low speed aerodynamics facilities for over 40 years till the DNW (the joint venture with the German sister organisation [[German Aerospace Center|DLR]]) became operational in 1980, followed by the LST 3 x 2.25 m² of NLR, both in the [[Noordoostpolder]].

During the five years of the [[Second World War]] the total contract work-load of the laboratory decreased dramatically although the personnel increased by 40%.&lt;ref name="Reports4445"&gt;NLR Annual Reports of 1944 and 1945&lt;/ref&gt; However, it appears that a large number of subjects were studied in depth.&lt;ref name="Reports4445"/&gt; When the Allied Forces entered the Netherlands in September 1944 the situation changed very dramatically. The food and fuel supply, already at a bare minimum, practically stopped. Everybody at the laboratory was mentally occupied with the problems of war, survival, food and fuel. 
It took several months after the Liberation Day on 5 May 1945 for the normal operations of the laboratory to become re-established. Although the laboratory did not incur physical damage during the war, it was not in good condition after the war. Above that, until 1952 there was a political climate unfavourable to NLL especially in terms of financial support for the expansion plans of the NLL that included a HST, among other facilities.

The year 1950 marked the beginning of international co-operation and cross utilisation of facilities between NLL and [[ONERA]]. On 23 February 1955 a contract between AICMA-CIPS and NLL was signed which stipulated that NLL would make available the HST to members of AICMA for up to 50% of the available testing time. Later, in 1976, a two-nation aeronautical test facility, the DNW of Germany and the Netherlands, became a reality, and it took until 1988 when finally a four-nation (France, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands) aeronautical test facility, the ETW, was opened.
In 1957, after a period of deliberations and negotiations, an area of 2 square kilometres was purchased in the Noordoostpolder (NOP). In 1958 the first NLR employees started working there. Since then there has been a gradual shift of activities from Amsterdam the NOP and several buildings were added.

==Sites==

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Sites NLR.jpg|thumb|Figure 7: NLR locations {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;

A staff of approximately 650 people is employed at two sites, one located in Amsterdam, and the other in Marknesse (about 100&amp;nbsp;km north-east of Amsterdam). Over two-thirds of the staff are graduates from universities or technical colleges, with a large variety in specialised professions such as [[aerospace engineer]]s, [[psychologists]], [[mathematicians]] and [[physicist]]s. Such variety is necessary for ensuring the broad expertise that is needed for coping with the most challenging problems in the aerospace sector.

At its two sites NLR owns several sophisticated aerospace research facilities, including different wind tunnels, such as the Low Speed Wind tunnel, the Transonic and the Supersonic Wind Tunnel. Exploitation of these wind tunnels and the wind tunnels of DLR have been entrusted to the foundation German-Dutch wind tunnels (DNW), which also includes a large facility in the Noordoostpolder in which Germany and the Netherlands have a share of 50%.

==Facilities==

NLR has a laboratory airplane, a [[Cessna Citation II]] (PH-LAB), latter shared with Delft University of Technology (TU Delft).

NLR has developed different [[flight simulators]] for research on aircraft and helicopters.

NLR conducts research on future concepts in Air Traffic Management (ATM) and Air Traffic Control (ATC) using its advanced proprietary simulation platform, the NLR ATC Research Simulator (NARSIM). NARSIM consists of two physical instantiations, one for en-route ATC (NARSIM-Radar) and one for airport tower controllers (NARSIM-Tower) with a 360-degrees field-of-view visual system. NARSIM is also used for performance of technology verification and validation activities as well as air traffic controller training.

NLR has installations in which airplane constructions on full scale, components and test samples can be tested. Equipment and software for development of construction of parts for airplanes and space vehicles are also available. For development and construction of composites a special laboratory has been arranged. Moreover, the NLR has instrumentation for flight tests, and several specialized apparatus for development of avionics. Facilities for testing antenna and conduction of so-called environmental tests are used to test several equipments. In the micromechanics workplace the NLR develops models and instruments for wind tunnel tests. The computer network of the NLR contains a supercomputer for the implementation of extensive aerodynamic and structural calculations.

{{Music Education|major}}

The '''Orff Schulwerk''', or simply the '''Orff Approach''', is a developmental approach used in [[music education]]. It combines [[music]], movement, [[drama]], and [[speech]] into lessons that are similar to [[child]]'s world of play. It was developed by the [[Germany|German]] composer [[Carl Orff]] (1895–1982) and colleague [[Gunild Keetman]] during the 1920s. Carl Orff worked until the end of his life to continue the development and spread of his teaching method. 

The Orff Approach is now used throughout the world to teach students in a natural and comfortable environment. The term "schulwerk" is [[German language|German]] for (literally) "school work" or "schooling", in this regard in the area of [[music]].

==Foundations==
The Orff Approach of [[music education]] uses very rudimentary forms of everyday activity for the purpose of music creation by music students. The Orff Approach is a "child-centered way of learning" music education that treats music as a basic system like [[language]] and believes that just as every child can learn language without formal instruction so can every child learn music by a gentle and friendly approach.&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;Campbell, Patricia Sherman. Musician and Teacher. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often called "Elemental Music making" because the materials needed to teach students are "basic, natural, and close to a child’s world of thought and fantasy".&lt;ref name="Shamrock"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shamrock|first=Mary|title=Orff- Schulwerk: An Integrated Method|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=83|issue=6|date=May 1997|pages=41–44|jstor=3399024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for the Orff Approach to effectively work teachers must create an atmosphere that is similar to a child’s world of play. This allows participating children to feel comfortable learning a new and often abstract musical skill, greater exploration of a [[musical instrument]] or musical skill, and keeps a student from feeling [[evaluate]]d or judged by his or her peers and teachers. A child participating in an Orff classroom does not feel the pressure of [[performing]] that is often in tandem with music because every student in an Orff classroom is treated as an equal, even when performing a solo. 

The Orff Approach is used by teachers to encourage their students to enjoy making music as individuals as well as in groups. Children realize the joys of [[Group (sociology)|group]] co-ordination and cohesion. It also involves the participation of other adults and parents in music making. Thus it brings the role of [[parent]] in child education in a central position. From a teacher’s aspect Orff-Schulwerk is also a process of breaking down each activity into its simplest form and then presenting those steps one at a time to eventually become a completed performance.

In the Orff Approach "all concepts are learned by ‘doing'".&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;"The Orff Approach to Music Education" By Gloria Day&lt;/ref&gt; Students of the Orff Approach learn music by experiencing and participating in the different musical lessons and activities. These lessons stimulate not only the paraxial concepts of music like rhythm and tempo, but also the aesthetic qualities of music. “Orff activities awaken the child’s total awareness” and “sensitize the child’s awareness of space, time, form, line, color, design, and mood- aesthetic data that musicians are acutely aware of, yet find hard to explain to musical novices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Banks|first=Susan|title=Orff- Schulwerk Teaches Musical Responsiveness|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=68|issue=7|date=March 1982|pages=42–43|jstor=3395939}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[Simply Music]] or the [[Suzuki Method]], the Orff Schulwerk approach is not a method. There is no systematic stepwise procedure to be followed.  There are fundamental principles, clear models and basic processes that all intuitive and creative teachers use to guide their organization of musical ideas.&lt;ref&gt;"Orff." Miranda, Martina MENC Meeting, February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==

The music generated in the Orff Approach is largely improvisational and uses original tonal constructions that build a sense of confidence and interest in the process of creative thinking. Students of the Orff Approach sing, play instruments, and dance alone as well as in groups. Songs are usually short, contain [[ostinato]]s, are within singing range, can be manipulated to be played in a round or ABA form. "Music is chosen with strong nationalistic flavor, being related to folk songs and music of the child’s own heritage".&lt;ref name="Day"/&gt; Music can also be anything from nursery rhymes to songs that are invented by the children themselves. Orff-Schulwerk music is largely based on simple but forceful variations on rhythmic patterns. This makes for very simple and beautiful musical forms, which are easily learned by young children, and is also useful for adults and thus it has a universal appeal.  Composer [[David Hewson (composer)|David Hewson]] was exposed to Orff Schulwerk and this influence helped to shape a lot of his later music.

The music is largely modal, beginning with pentatonic (both major and minor) scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Orff - Keetman|title=Music for Children Vol I|year=1958|publisher=Schott}}&lt;/ref&gt; (English version adapted by Margaret Murray) The drone or bordun, is quickly established as the ground bass that supports most melodies and melodic ostinati add energy and colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Goodkin|first=Doug|title=Play, Sing and Dance|year=2004|publisher=Schott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume II in Part One, covers hexachordal (added fa)melodies over Major Drone Bass Triads, and then seven notes: Ionian mode. Note, this is not major scale, as the drone bass enforces a non-functional harmony. Parallel thirds and sixths (paraphony) are used liberally here. Part Two introduces the use of triads as following: I - ii, and some I - vi.

Goodkin (p172) discusses the progression of the volumes:  I-II-III-IV-V as opposed to I-II-IV-III-V. Volume III introduces Major Dominant and Subdominant triads (That is to say: functional harmony). However Volume IV can be viewed as more logically the next step as it introduces Dorian, Aeolian and Phrygian modes with similar shifting drones and triads to those found previously in Vol II.

Vol IV, Part One: Minor-Drone Bass Triads. Aeolian, Dorian and Phrygian mode, i-ii shifting drones and triads. Part Two: Tonic and Leading Note triads, i-IV and decoration of the third.

Vol III Major Dominant and Subdominant Triads. This harmonic world is more challenging for children and improvising than the modes, hence the importance of leaving until skills have developed appropriately.

Volume V follows III, but explores Minor Dominant and Subdominant Chords.

And finally, almost as an afterthought, Paralipomena which explores the worlds of Lydian I-II, and Mixolydian I-VII.

When interesting original music has been generated by the groups or individual child a desire to record it may arise. Thus, the desire to develop musical skills emerges by itself and the child may be intrinsically propelled to learn formal music.

==Instruments and tools==
[[File:Intrumentarium Orff-Schulwerkde la société Studio 49.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Some typical teaching instruments ''Orff-Schulwerk'']]
Orff considered the percussive [[rhythm]] as a natural basic form of [[human]] expression. Carl Orff and colleague [[Gunild Keetman]] co-composed much of the music for the five volume series, ''Music for Children.''  These volumes, first published in 1950, are still available and used today. Music played on Orff instruments is often very simple and easy to play even for first time musicians.

Some of the instruments within the approach include miniature [[xylophones]], [[marimbas]], [[glockenspiels]], and [[metallophones]]; all of which have removable bars, resonating columns to project the sound, and are easily transported and stored. Orff teachers also use different sized [[drums]], [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorders]], and non- pitched percussion instruments "to round out the songs that are sung and played".&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; The Orff approach also requires that children sing, chant, clap, dance, pat, and snap fingers along to melodies and rhythms.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt;

==Spread==

In 1923 Carl Orff met [http://www.orff.de/en/life/educational-works/guenther-school.html Dorothee Günther] while working at a theater in [[Munich]], [[Germany]]. Günther "believed that most students did not get enough chances to do art and music and movement activities".&lt;ref name="Gray"&gt;Gray, Esther. "Orff- Schulwerk: Where Did it Come From?" The Orff Beat-Centenary Issue XXIV (June 1995). Victorian Orff Schulwerk Association. 3 May 2009 &lt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vosa.org/paul/orff_history.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090915154530/http://www.vosa.org/paul/orff_history.htm |archivedate=15 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her extensive background in gymnastics and the arts Gunter was able to open the Gunter-Schule in 1924. Even though [[Carl Orff]] never worked with the students of the Gunter-Schule directly, this was the first institution to teach what would later be known as the Orff Approach.

Students of the Günther-Schule later went on to be dancers and teachers of note. One of these students, Gunild Keetman, began as a student and became a teacher at the school. The Gunter-Schule originally only taught older students; however, Keetman later worked on developing the ideas of the school to teach younger children as well. Together she and [[Carl Orff]] created the five volume series "Music for Children" which is still used by teachers today. The Gunter-Schule ran until 1944 when [[Nazis]] confiscated it. In 1945 the building was destroyed in an Allied bomb attack and all materials (instruments, costumes, photographs, and its library and archives) were destroyed.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;

After the war, two serendipitous events brought Orff's approach back into the educational field.  A series of [[radio]] programs aimed at children was broadcast in [[Bavaria]]. Orff wrote the music and re-united with Keetman to work on these broadcasts. The second event was the Mozartariums' request to have Keetman teach classes to children between 8 and 10 years old. Traude Schrattenecker who was also a graduate of the Gunter-Schule, joined Keetman in running this school.&lt;ref name="Gray"/&gt;

There are Orff Schulwerk associations in different countries across the [[world]] including [[Germany]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[Korea]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[South Africa]], [[France]], [[Finland]] and [[New Zealand]]. All of these organisations promote the teachings of [[Carl Orff]] and [[Gunild Keetman]] and the spread of the Approach. Through all of these organizations teachers interested in teaching the Orff Approach can become certified in the Approach.

==The American model ==

The American Orff-Schulwerk Association offers three different levels of training, each of which takes 60 hours to complete. Level one focuses on the "necessary skills to plan and implement a variety of Orff Schulwerk [[music]] and movement activities in the classroom." "Levels two and three are concerned with development of conceptual understanding of music and movement elements as they are presented in the Schulwerk elemental music context, as well as the skill needed to implement them".&lt;ref&gt;American Orff-Schulwerk. Association&lt;/ref&gt;

In America there are four stages in the Orff Approach:  [[imitation]], exploration, [[improvisation]], and composition.&lt;ref name="Campbell"/&gt; Through imitation, the teacher, group leader, or even the students perform for the class and the class in turn repeats what was played for them. Exploration allows students to seek out the musical aspects that the Orff instruments offer and explore [[aural]]/[[Mouth|oral]] skills and the motions and expressions that the body is capable of. Literacy is taught by learning musical notation and becoming familiar with forms of music like [[rondo]] and ABA. Improvisation is the act of creating something, especially music, without prior preparation.&lt;ref name="Shamrock"/&gt; To improvise, a student must have "a preliminary knowledge and comprehension of concepts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Judith|title=Orff-Based Improvisation|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=66|issue=5|date=January 1980|pages=58–61|jstor=3395777}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students of the Orff Approach learn to create their own melodies in a comfortable environment that allows for mistakes and promotes creativity.

==Orff Schulwerk in Aotearoa/New Zealand==

[http://www.orffnz.org Orff New Zealand Aotearoa (ONZA)] is a professional society dedicated to the promotion of the Orff Schulwerk approach in New Zealand. The organisation is a member of the [http://www.orff-schulwerk-forum-salzburg.org Orff Schulwerk Forum Salzburg]. In association with the [https://education.waikato.ac.nz/about/departments/arts-and-language-department/orff-schulwerk/ University of Waikato], ONZA offers a four-tiered course of study in the Orff approach, which includes practical workshops and critical investigation.

==Other applications==

The Orff Approach was originally intended to teach music to children but because of the different benefits that it offers with [[motor coordination|coordination]], [[dexterity]], and [[concentration]] the technique is often used to teach individuals with [[special needs]]. The simplicity of the technique allows all ranges of [[handicapped]] students to participate in the learning process. [[Mentally handicapped]] students can easily perform the tasks without fear of being ridiculed or being left behind. The [[visually impaired]]/[[blindness|blind]] who tend to have "hesitant, jerky, and over controlled" movements because they "often breathe quite shallowly" can use the different breathing and movement exercises to relax their body and breathing.&lt;ref name="Bitcon"&gt;Bitcon, Carol Hampton. Alike and Different: The Clinical and Educational Use or Orff Schulwerk. Santa Ana, CA: Rosha Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Students with a [[hearing impairment]]  can use the Orff Approach by feeling the [[vibrations]] that are created by different [[musical instrument|instruments]]. Since music is mostly resilient, students who have had injuries that have mentally impaired them can use the Approach as a form of [[therapy]]. Even elderly individuals who often become weak with old age can use the Orff Approach to help with [[memory]], [[dexterity]], and [[agility]].&lt;ref name="Bitcon"/&gt;

'''Partial impact theory''' is an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] theory describing the partial collision of two [[star]]s and the temporary creation of a bright third [[star]] as a consequence. The theory was explained in [[Alexander William Bickerton]]'s book ''The Romance of the Heavens'' published in 1901.

In ''The Romance of the Heavens'' [[Alexander William Bickerton|Bickerton]] states that a slight ''"grazing"'' collision between stars would be much more common than a head on impact between stars. So he believed this phenomenon needed to be explained to account for the appearance of bright new stars that would appear in the night sky and disappear within a year or even days.

The theory explains that when the two [[Star|stellar]] bodies graze each other, the grazed parts will shear off from the main body of each star. Their velocity will cancel each other's out transforming this energy into heat. While the main mass of each star will continue moving as they did before the collision. The third body created from the two sheared parts of the stars will form between the two original stars.

The temporary star expands after the impact displaying an intense increase in light, after all molecular reactions have taken place the light is replaced by a hollow shell of gas or possibly a [[planetary nebula]], and eventually dissipates into [[space]]. [[Alexander William Bickerton|Bickerton]] explains this bright temporary star by saying that it doesn't disappear due to cooling, but that it was too hot to hold together.

The temperature of the third star, isn't dependent on the amount of contact between the two original stars, but rather the chemical makeup of the stars and their velocities going into the collision. The stability of the third body depends on the size of the contact of the original stars, if the contact was small then the mass of the newly created third body will find it harder to attract [[molecules]] to it. Rather than if it had a larger mass where molecules would find it more difficult to escape from its larger gravitational pull.&lt;ref&gt;Bickerton, A.W, (1901).''The Romance of the Heavens''. London. Swan Sonnencchein &amp; Co., Lim.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phototrophic biofilms''' occur on contact surfaces in a range of terrestrial and aquatic environments. Phototrophic biofilms can best be described as surface attached microbial communities (see also [[Biofilm]] and [[Chemistry of Biofilm Prevention]]) mainly driven by light as the energy source with [[phototroph]]ic organisms clearly present. Eukaryotic [[algae]] and [[cyanobacteria]] generate energy and reduce carbon dioxide, providing organic substrates and [[oxygen]]. The [[photosynthetic]] activity fuels processes and conversions in the total biofilm community, including the [[heterotrophic]] fraction.

Thick laminated multilayered phototrophic biofilms are usually referred to as [[microbial mat]]s or phototrophic mats (see also [[biofilm]]). Phototrophic biofilms and microbial mats have been described in extreme environments like thermal springs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roeselers G, Norris TB, Castenholz RW |title=Diversity of phototrophic bacteria in microbial mats from Arctic hot springs (Greenland) |journal=Environmental Microbiology |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=26–38 |date=Jan 2007 |pmid=17227409 |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2006.01103.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; hyper saline ponds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sørensen KB, Canfield DE, Teske AP, Oren A |title=Community composition of a hypersaline endoevaporitic microbial mat |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=71 |issue=11 |pages=7352–65 |date=Nov 2005 |pmid=16269778 |pmc=1287706 |doi=10.1128/AEM.71.11.7352-7365.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; desert soil crusts, and in lake ice covers in Antarctica. The 3.4-billion-year fossil record of [[benthic]] phototrophic communities, such as microbial mats and [[stromatolites]], indicates that these associations represent the Earth's oldest known ecosystems. It is thought that these early ecosystems played a key role in the build-up of [[oxygen]] in the [[Earth’s atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoehler TM, Bebout BM, Des Marais DJ |title=The role of microbial mats in the production of reduced gases on the early Earth |journal=Nature |volume=412 |issue=6844 |pages=324–7 |date=Jul 2001 |pmid=11460161 |doi=10.1038/35085554 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a growing interest in the application of phototrophic biofilms, for instance in wastewater treatment in [[constructed wetlands]], [[bioremediation]], [[aquaculture]], and [[biohydrogen]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roeselers G, van Loosdrecht MC, Muyzer G |title=Phototrophic biofilms and their potential applications |journal=Journal of Applied Phycology |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=227–35 |date=Jun 2007 |doi=10.1007/s10811-007-9223-2|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n518x09k16133052/ |pmid=19396356 |pmc=2668646}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Phytic acid''' (known as '''inositol hexakisphosphate''' ('''IP6'''), '''inositol polyphosphate''', or '''phytate''' when in [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] form) is the phosphate ester of [[inositol]]. It contains six phosphate groups.  At physiological pH, these phosphates are partially ionized.  The resulting anion is a colorless species that has significant nutritional role as the principal storage form of [[phosphorus]] in many [[plant]] [[Biological tissue|tissue]]s, especially [[bran]] and [[seed]]s.&lt;ref name="schlemmer"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19774556|year=2009|last1=Schlemmer|first1=U.|title=Phytate in foods and significance for humans: Food sources, intake, processing, bioavailability, protective role and analysis|journal=Molecular Nutrition &amp; Food Research|volume=53 Suppl 2|pages=S330–75|last2=Frølich|first2=W.|last3=Prieto|first3=R.

[[Catabolism|Catabolites]] of phytic acid are called lower inositol polyphosphates. Examples are inositol penta- (IP5), tetra- (IP4), and triphosphate (IP3).

==Significance in agriculture==
Phosphorus and inositol in phytate form are not, in general, [[bioavailability|bioavailable]] to non[[ruminant]] animals because these animals lack the digestive [[enzyme]] [[phytase]] required to hydrolyze (break) the inositol-phosphate linkages. [[Ruminant]]s are readily able to digest phytate because of the phytase produced by [[rumen]] [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref name="CAST"&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=Terry J. |last1=Klopfenstein |first2=Rosalina |last2=Angel |first3=Gary |last3=Cromwell |first4=Galen E. |last4=Erickson |first5=Danny G. |last5=Fox |first6=Carl |last6=Parsons |first7=Larry D. |last7=Satter |first8=Alan L. |last8=Sutton |first9=David H. |last9=Baker | name-list-format = vanc |date=July 2002 |title=Animal Diet Modification to Decrease the Potential for Nitrogen and Phosphorus Pollution |journal=Council for Agricultural Science and Technology |volume=21 |url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/animalscifacpub/518/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most commercial [[agriculture]], non-ruminant [[livestock]], such as [[swine]], [[fowl]], and [[fish]],&lt;ref name="CASTI"&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Romarheim OH, Zhang C, Penn M, Liu YJ, Tian LX, Skrede A, Krogdahl Å, Storebakken T  |year=2008 |journal=Aquaculture Nutrition|title=Growth and intestinal morphology in cobia (Rachycentron canadum) fed extruded diets with two types of soybean meal partly replacing fish meal |volume=14 |issue=2 |pages=174–180 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2095.2007.00517.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; are fed mainly [[grain]]s, such as [[maize]], [[legume]]s, and [[soybean]]s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Because phytate from these grains and beans is unavailable for absorption, the unabsorbed phytate passes through the [[gastrointestinal tract]], elevating the amount of phosphorus in the manure.&lt;ref name="CAST" /&gt; Excess phosphorus excretion can lead to environmental problems, such as [[eutrophication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1023690824045 |jstor=27503850| year = 2003 |title=Industrialized Animal Production—A Major Source of Nutrient and Microbial Pollution to Aquatic Ecosystems| vauthors = Mallin MA | journal = Population and Environment| volume = 24| issue = 5| pages = 369–385}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of sprouted grains will reduce the quantity of phytic acids in feed, with no significant reduction of nutritional value.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01092036 |title=Nutritive value of malted millet flours |year=1986 |last1=Malleshi |first1=N. G. |journal=Plant Foods for Human Nutrition |volume=36 |pages=191–6 |last2=Desikachar |first2=H. S. R.|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, viable low-phytic acid mutant lines have been developed in several crop species in which the seeds have drastically reduced levels of phytic acid and concomitant increases in inorganic phosphorus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Guttieri MJ, Peterson KM, Souza EJ |doi=10.2135/cropsci2006.03.0137 |title=Milling and Baking Quality of Low Phytic Acid Wheat | journal=Crop Science |volume=46 |pages=2403–8|issue=6|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, germination problems have reportedly hindered the use of these cultivars thus far. This may be due to phytic acid's critical role in both phosphorus and metal ion storage.{{Citation needed|date=April  2007}} Phytate variants also have the potential to be used in soil remediation, to immobilize [[uranium]], nickel and other inorganic contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seaman JC, Hutchison JM, Jackson BP, Vulava VM | title = In situ treatment of metals in contaminated soils with phytate | journal = Journal of Environmental Quality | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 153–61 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12549554 | doi = 10.2134/jeq2003.0153 }}{&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological and physiological roles==
Although indigestible for many animals, phytic acid and its metabolites as they occur in seeds and grains have several important roles for the seedling plant.

Most notably, phytic acid functions as a phosphorus store, as an energy store, as a source of cations and as a source of myoinositol (a cell wall precursor). Phytic acid is the principal storage form of phosphorus in plant seeds.&lt;ref name="Reddy"&gt;{{Cite book | vauthors = Reddy NR, Sathe SK, Salunkhe DK | title = Phytates in legumes and cereals | journal = Advances in Food Research | volume = 28 | pages = 1–92 | year = 1982 | pmid = 6299067 | doi = 10.1016/s0065-2628(08)60110-x | isbn = 9780120164288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In animal cells, myoinositol polyphosphates are ubiquitous, and phytic acid (myoinositol hexakisphosphate) is the most abundant, with its concentration ranging from 10 to 100 µM in mammalian cells, depending on cell type and developmental stage.&lt;ref name="Szwergold"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Szwergold BS, Graham RA, Brown TR | title = Observation of inositol pentakis- and hexakis-phosphates in mammalian tissues by 31P NMR | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 149 | issue = 3 | pages = 874–81 | date = December 1987 | pmid = 3426614 | doi = 10.1016/0006-291X(87)90489-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sasakawa"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sasakawa N, Sharif M, Hanley MR | title = Metabolism and biological activities of inositol pentakisphosphate and inositol hexakisphosphate | journal = Biochemical Pharmacology | volume = 50 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–46 | date = July 1995 | pmid = 7543266 | doi = 10.1016/0006-2952(95)00059-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This compound is not obtained from the animal diet, but must be synthesized inside the cell from phosphate and inositol (which in turn is produced from glucose, usually in the kidneys). The interaction of intracellular phytic acid with specific intracellular proteins has been investigated ''in vitro'', and these interactions have been found to result in the inhibition or potentiation of the physiological activities of those proteins.&lt;ref name="Hanakahi"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hanakahi LA, Bartlet-Jones M, Chappell C, Pappin D, West SC | title = Binding of inositol phosphate to DNA-PK and stimulation of double-strand break repair | journal = Cell | volume = 102 | issue = 6 | pages = 721–9 | date = September 2000 | pmid = 11030616 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)00061-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norris"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norris FA, Ungewickell E, Majerus PW | title = Inositol hexakisphosphate binds to clathrin assembly protein 3 (AP-3/AP180) and inhibits clathrin cage assembly in vitro | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 270 | issue = 1 | pages = 214–7 | date = January 1995 | pmid = 7814377 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.270.1.214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best evidence from these studies suggests an intracellular role for phytic acid as a cofactor in DNA repair by nonhomologous end-joining.&lt;ref name="Hanakahi"/&gt; Other studies using yeast mutants have also suggested intracellular phytic acid may be involved in mRNA export from the nucleus to the cytosol.&lt;ref name="York"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = York JD, Odom AR, Murphy R, Ives EB, Wente SR | title = A phospholipase C-dependent inositol polyphosphate kinase pathway required for efficient messenger RNA export | journal = Science | volume = 285 | issue = 5424 | pages = 96–100 | date = July 1999 | pmid = 10390371 | doi = 10.1126/science.285.5424.96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shears1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shears SB | title = Assessing the omnipotence of inositol hexakisphosphate | journal = Cellular Signalling | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 151–8 | date = March 2001 | pmid = 11282453 | doi = 10.1016/S0898-6568(01)00129-2 | url = https://zenodo.org/record/1260121 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inositol hexaphosphate facilitates the formation of the six-helix bundle and assembly of the immature HIV-1 Gag lattice. IP6 makes ionic contacts with two rings of lysine residues at the centre of the Gag hexamer. Proteolytic cleavage then unmasks an alternative binding site, where IP6 interaction promotes the assembly of the mature capsid lattice. These studies identify IP6 as a naturally occurring small molecule that promotes both assembly and maturation of HIV-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dick RA, Zadrozny KK, Xu C, Schur FK, Lyddon TD, Ricana CL, Wagner JM, Perilla JR, Ganser-Pornillos BK, Johnson MC, Pornillos O, Vogt VM | title = Inositol phosphates are assembly co-factors for HIV-1 | journal = Nature | volume = 560 | issue = 7719 | pages = 509–512 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30069050 | doi = 10.1038/s41586-018-0396-4 | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0396-4#article-info }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:HRDiagram.png|thumb|upright=1.4|The red clump is the prominent group of [[red giant]] stars at about 5,000 K and {{solar luminosity|75}}.]]
The '''red clump''' is a clustering of [[red giant]]s in the [[Hertzsprung–Russell diagram]] at around 5,000 K and [[absolute magnitude]] (M&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) +0.5, slightly hotter than most [[red giant branch|red-giant-branch]] stars of the same luminosity.  It is visible as a more dense region of the red giant branch or a bulge towards hotter temperatures.  It is most distinct in many, but not all, galactic [[open cluster]]s, but it is also noticeable in many intermediate-age [[globular cluster]]s and in nearby field stars (e.g. the Hipparcos stars).

The red clump giants are cool [[horizontal branch]] stars, stars originally similar to the Sun which have undergone a [[helium flash]] and are now [[helium fusion|fusing helium]] in their cores.

==Properties==
Red clump stellar properties vary depending on their origin, most notably on the [[metallicity]] of the stars, but typically they have early K spectral types and [[effective temperature]]s around 5,000 K.  The absolute [[visual magnitude]] of red clump giants near the sun has been measured at an average of +0.81 with metallicities between &amp;minus;0.6 and +0.4 dex.&lt;ref name=soubirain&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20021615|title=Vertical distribution of Galactic disk stars|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=398|pages=141|year=2003|last1=Soubiran|first1=C.|last2=Bienaymé|first2=O.|last3=Siebert|first3=A.|arxiv = astro-ph/0210628 |bibcode = 2003A&amp;A...398..141S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a considerable spread in the properties of red clump stars even within a single population of similar stars such as an open cluster.  This is partly due to the natural variation in temperatures and luminosities of horizontal branch stars when they form and as they evolve, and partly due to the presence of other stars with similar properties.&lt;ref name=girardi&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1999MNRAS.308..818G|arxiv=astro-ph/9901319|title=A secondary clump of red giant stars: Why and where|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|volume=308|issue=3|pages=818|author1=Girardi|first1=Léo|year=1999|doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.1999.02746.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although red clump stars are generally hotter than red-giant-branch stars, the two regions overlap and the status of individual stars can only be assigned with a detailed chemical abundance study.&lt;ref name=ree/&gt;&lt;ref name=nataf&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2010ApJ...721L..28N|arxiv=1007.5065|title=The Split Red Clump of the Galactic Bulge from OGLE-III|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|volume=721|pages=L28|author1=Nataf|first1=D.

==Evolution==
{{main article|Horizontal branch}}
[[File:Open cluster HR diagram ages.gif|thumb|upright=1.0|Old open clusters showing barely detectable red clumps&lt;ref name=WIYN&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1999AJ....118.2321S|title=WIYN Open Cluster Study.

Modelling of the horizontal branch has shown that stars have a strong tendency to cluster at the cool end of the zero age horizontal branch (ZAHB).  This tendency is weaker in low metallicity stars, so the red clump is usually more prominent in metal-rich clusters.  However, there are other effects, and there are well-populated red clumps in some metal-poor globular clusters.&lt;ref name=zhao&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2001ApJ...551L..85Z|title=High-Resolution Spectroscopic Observations of Hipparcos Red Clump Giants: Metallicity and Mass Determinations|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=551|pages=L85|author1=Zhao|first1=G.|last2=Qiu|first2=H. M.|last3=Mao|first3=Shude|year=2001|doi=10.1086/319832}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dantona&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2004ApJ...611..871D|arxiv=astro-ph/0405016|title=The Early Evolution of Globular Clusters: The Case of NGC 2808|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=611|issue=2|pages=871|author1=d'Antona|first1=Francesca|last2=Caloi|first2=Vittoria|year=2004|doi=10.1086/422334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stars with a similar mass to the sun evolve towards the tip of the red giant branch with a [[degenerate matter|degenerate]] helium core.  More massive stars leave the red giant branch early and perform a blue loop, but all stars with a degenerate core reach the tip with very similar core masses, temperatures, and luminosities.  After the helium flash they lie along the ZAHB, all with helium cores just under {{solar mass|0.5}} and their properties determined mostly by the size of the hydrogen envelope outside the core.  Lower envelope masses result in weaker [[CNO cycle|hydrogen shell fusion]] and give hotter and slightly less luminous stars strung along the horizontal branch.  Different initial masses and natural variations in mass loss rates on the red giant branch cause the variations in the envelope masses even though the helium cores are all the same size.  Low-metallicity stars are more sensitive to the size of the hydrogen envelope, so with the same envelope masses they are spread further along the horizontal branch and fewer fall in the red clump.

Although red clump stars lie consistently to the hot side of the red giant branch that they evolved from, red clump and red-giant-branch stars from different populations can overlap.  This occurs in [[Omega Centauri|ω Centauri]] where metal-poor red-giant-branch stars have the same or hotter temperatures as more metal-rich red clump giants.&lt;ref name=ree&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2002ASPC..265..101R|title=Synthetic Color-Magnitude Diagrams for ω Centauri and Other Massive Globular Clusters with Multiple Populations|journal=Omega Centauri|volume=265|pages=101|author1=Ree|first1=C. H.|last2=Yoon|first2=S.-J.|last3=Rey|first3=S.-C.|last4=Lee|first4=Y.-W.|year=2002|arxiv = astro-ph/0110689 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other stars, not strictly horizontal branch stars, can lie in the same region of the H-R diagram.  Stars too massive to develop a degenerate helium core on the red giant branch will ignite helium before the [[tip of the red giant branch]] and perform a blue loop.  For stars only a little more massive than the sun, around {{solar mass|2}}, the blue loop is very short and at a luminosity similar to the red clump giants.  These stars are an order of magnitude less common than sun-like stars, even rarer compared to the sub-solar stars that can form red clump giants, and the duration of the blue loop is far less than the time spent by a red clump giant on the horizontal branch.  This means that these imposters are much less common in the H-R diagram, but still detectable.&lt;ref name=girardi/&gt;

Stars with {{solar mass|2 - 3}} will also pass through the red clump as they evolve along the [[subgiant branch]].  This is again a very rapid phase of [[stellar evolution|evolution]], but stars such as [[OU Andromedae]] are found in the red clump region (5,500&amp;nbsp;K and {{solar luminosity|100}}) even though it is thought to be a subgiant crossing the [[Hertzsprung gap]].&lt;ref name=girardi/&gt;

==Standard candles==
In theory, the [[bolometric luminosity|absolute luminosities]] of stars in the red clump are fairly independent of stellar composition or age so that consequently they make good [[standard candle]]s for estimating astronomical distances both within our galaxy and to nearby galaxies and clusters.  Variations due to metallicity, mass, age, and [[Extinction (astronomy)|extinctions]] affect visual observations too much for them to be useful, but the effects are much smaller in the infrared.  [[Near infrared]] [[Photometric system#Photometric letters|I band]] observations in particular have been used to establish red clump distances.  Absolute magnitudes for the red clump at solar metallicity have been measured at &amp;minus;0.22 in the [[UBVRI|I band]] and &amp;minus;1.54 in the [[K band (infrared)|K band]].&lt;ref name=groenewegen&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:200810201|title=The red clump absolute magnitude based on revised Hipparcos parallaxes|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=488|issue=3|pages=935|year=2008|last1=Groenewegen|first1=M. A. T.|arxiv = 0807.2764 |bibcode = 2008A&amp;A...488..935G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The distance to the [[galactic centre]] has been measured in this way, giving a result of 7.52 kpc in agreement with other methods.&lt;ref name=nishiyama&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=2006ApJ...647.1093N|arxiv=astro-ph/0607408|title=The Distance to the Galactic Center Derived from Infrared Photometry of Bulge Red Clump Stars|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=647|issue=2|pages=1093|author1=Nishiyama|first1=Shogo|last2=Nagata|first2=Tetsuya|last3=Sato|first3=Shuji|last4=Kato|first4=Daisuke|last5=Nagayama|first5=Takahiro|last6=Kusakabe|first6=Nobuhiko|last7=Matsunaga|first7=Noriyuki|last8=Naoi|first8=Takahiro|last9=Sugitani|first9=Koji|last10=Tamura|first10=Motohide|year=2006|doi=10.1086/505529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Red bump==
The red clump should not be confused with the "red bump" or red-giant-branch bump, which is a less noticeable clustering of giants partway along the [[red giant branch]], caused as stars ascending the red giant branch temporarily decrease in luminosity because of internal convection.&lt;ref name=alves&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1999ApJ...511..225A|title=The Age-dependent Luminosities of the Red Giant Branch Bump, Asymptotic Giant Branch Bump, and Horizontal Branch Red Clump|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=511|pages=225|author1=Alves|first1=David R.|last2=Sarajedini|first2=Ata|year=1999|doi=10.1086/306655|arxiv = astro-ph/9808253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Roger Carl Schank''' (born 1946) is an American [[artificial intelligence]] theorist, [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologist]], [[learning sciences|learning scientist]], educational reformer, and [[entrepreneur]].

Beginning in the late 1960s, he pioneered [[conceptual dependency theory]] (within the context of [[natural language understanding]]) and [[case-based reasoning]], both of which challenged [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] views of memory and reasoning.

In 1989, Schank was granted $30 million in a 10-year commitment to his research and development by [[Andersen Consulting]], through which he founded the Institute for the Learning Sciences (ILS) at [[Northwestern University]] in Chicago.

==Academic career==
For his undergraduate degree, Schank studied mathematics at [[Carnegie Mellon University]]&lt;ref name="shank_tank"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Freedman|first1=David|title=The Schank Tank|url=https://www.wired.com/1994/08/schank/|website=Wired|publisher=Wired|accessdate=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh PA]], and later was awarded a PhD in [[linguistics]] at the [[University of Texas]] in Austin and went on to work in faculty positions at [[Stanford University]] and then at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name=freedman&gt;{{Cite news| volume = 2| issue = 8| last = Freedman| first = David H.| title = The Schank Tank| work = Wired| accessdate = 2011-10-04| date = August 1994| url = https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.08/schank_pr.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, he became professor of [[computer science]] and [[psychology]] at Yale University. In 1981, Schank became Chairman of Computer Science at Yale and director of the Yale Artificial Intelligence Project.&lt;ref name=bio1&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography: Part 1 of 2|work=RogerSchank.com|url=http://www.rogerschank.com/biography.html|year=2009|accessdate=October 9, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006130700/http://www.rogerschank.com/biography.html|archivedate=October 6, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Schank was granted $30 million in a 10-year commitment to his research and development by [[Accenture|Andersen Consulting]], allowing him to leave Yale and set up the Institute for the Learning Sciences (ILS) at [[Northwestern University]] in Chicago, bringing along 25 of his Yale colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Glenn|last=Rifkin|title= Andersen Consulting's Culture of 'Clones'|work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/06/business/andersen-consulting-s-culture-of-clones.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|date=September 6, 1992|accessdate= September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ILS attracted other corporate sponsors such as [[IBM]] and [[Ameritech]], as well as government sponsors such as the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] and the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]],&lt;ref name=bio2 /&gt; leading to a focus on the development of educational software,&lt;ref name=freedman /&gt; especially in employee training.&lt;ref name=bio2&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography: Part 2 of 2|work=RogerSchank.com|url=http://www.rogerschank.com/biography-part2.html|year=2009|accessdate=October 9, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006151508/http://www.rogerschank.com/biography-part2.html|archivedate=October 6, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ILS was later absorbed by the School of Education as a separate department.

When Carnegie Mellon University's [[Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley|Silicon Valley campus]] was established in 2002, Schank came to serve as Chief Educational Officer at the institution.&lt;ref name=socratic /&gt;

==Entrepreneurship==
While at Yale in 1979, Schank was among the first to "capitalize on the expected boom"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Pollack|work= New York Times|title=Selling artificial intelligence |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/13/business/selling-artificial-intelligence.html|date=September 13, 1982|accessdate=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in AI when he founded Cognitive Systems, a company that went public in 1986. Schank resigned as chairman and chief executive in 1988 for personal reasons, but stayed as a board member and advisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top officer resigns at Cognitive Systems|work=New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/24/business/business-people-top-officer-resigns-at-cognitive-systems.html|date=June 24, 1988|accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Schank founded Cognitive Arts Corporation&lt;ref name=socratic&gt;{{cite web|title=Roger Schank|work=Socratic Arts |url=http://www.socraticarts.com/about.cfm?lead=Roger-Schank|accessdate=October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (originally named Learning Sciences Corporation) to market the software developed at ILS, and led the company until it was sold in 2003.

From 2005 to 2007, Schank was the chief learning officer of Trump University.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/trump-university-i-state-accreditation-issue-roger-schank&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 he founded Socratic Arts, a company that sells e-learning software to both businesses and schools.&lt;ref name=bio2 /&gt;

In 2008, Schank built a story-centered curriculum (SCC) at the Business Engineering School of La Salle International Graduate School of [[Ramon Llull University]], Barcelona to teach MBA students to launch their own businesses or to go to work.&lt;ref name=bio2 /&gt;

In 2012, Schank founded XTOL (Experiential Training Online) which "designs learn-by-doing experiential short courses for use by universities, corporations and professional organizations, as well as Master's programs in partnership with degree-granting universities around the world."&lt;ref name=xtol&gt;{{cite web|title=XTOL (Experiential Training Online)|url=http://www.xtolcorp.com/|accessdate=January 21, 2014| website=XTOL Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational reform==
Schank believes that the educational system is fundamentally broken and that software will need to replace conventional teaching methods.&lt;ref name=green&gt;{{cite news|first=Joshua|last=Green|title=No Lectures or Teachers, Just Software|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20000811friday.html| date=August 11, 2000|accessdate=October 10, 2011|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; To serve this purpose, he founded Engines for Education in 2001, a not-for-profit organization which designs and implements curricula for primary and secondary schools&lt;ref name=bio2 /&gt; and hosts the Virtual International Science and Technology Academy (VISTA).

==Influence==
Schank was a leading pioneer of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive psychology]] in the 1970s and 1980s. His innovations in these fields were [[conceptual dependency theory]] and [[case-based reasoning]], both of which challenged [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] views of memory and reasoning.

In 1969 Schank introduced the [[conceptual dependency theory]] for [[natural language understanding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| pages = 1–3| last = Schank| first = Roger| title = A conceptual dependency parser for natural language| booktitle =  Proceedings of the 1969 conference on Computational linguistics| location = Sång-Säby, Sweden| year = 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model, partly based on the work of [[Sydney Lamb]], was extensively used by Schank's students at [[Yale University]], such as [[Robert Wilensky]], Wendy Lehnert, and [[Janet Kolodner]].

Case-based reasoning (CBR) is based on Schank's model of dynamic memory&lt;ref name="ref_schank"&gt;Roger Schank, Dynamic Memory: ''A Theory of Learning in Computers and People'' (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1982)&lt;/ref&gt; and was the basis for the earliest CBR systems: [[Janet Kolodner|Janet Kolodner's]] CYRUS&lt;ref name="ref_kolodner"&gt;Janet Kolodner, "Reconstructive Memory: A Computer Model," ''Cognitive Science'' 7 (1983): 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and Michael Lebowitz's IPP.&lt;ref name="ref_lebowitz"&gt;Michael Lebowitz, "Memory-Based Parsing," ''Artificial Intelligence'' 21 (1983), 363-404.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other schools of CBR and closely allied fields emerged in the 1980s, investigating such topics as CBR in legal reasoning, memory-based reasoning (a way of reasoning from examples on massively parallel machines), and combinations of CBR with other reasoning methods.  In the 1990s, interest in CBR grew, as evidenced by the establishment of an International Conference on Case-Based Reasoning in 1995, as well as European, German, British, Italian, and other CBR workshops.

CBR technology has produced a number of successful deployed systems, the earliest being Lockheed's CLAVIER,&lt;ref name="ref_mark"&gt;Bill Mark, "Case-Based Reasoning for Autoclave Management," ''Proceedings of the Case-Based Reasoning Workshop'' (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; a system for laying out composite parts to be baked in an industrial convection oven. CBR has been used extensively in [[help desk]] applications such as the Compaq SMART system&lt;ref name="ref_nguyen"&gt;Trung Nguyen, Mary Czerwinski, and Dan Lee, "COMPAQ QuickSource: Providing the Consumer with the Power of Artificial Intelligence," in ''Proceedings of the Fifth Annual Conference on Innovative Applications of Artificial Intelligence'' (Washington, DC: AAAI Press, 1993), 142-151.&lt;/ref&gt; and has found a major application area in the health sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1109/TSMCC.2010.2071862| issn = 1094-6977| volume = 41| issue = 4| pages = 421–434| last = Begum| first = S.|author2=M.

A '''slide library''' is a library that houses a collection of photographic [[reversal film|slides]], either as a part of a larger [[library]] or standing alone within a larger organization, such as an academic department of a college or university, a museum, or a corporation.  Typically, a "slide library" contains slides depicting [[Visual arts|artwork]], [[architecture]], or cultural objects, and is typically used for the study, teaching, and documentation of [[art history]], architectural history, and visual culture. Other academic disciplines, such as [[biology]] and other sciences, also maintain image collections akin to slide libraries. Corporations may also have image libraries to maintain and document their publications and history. Increasingly, these types of libraries are known as "Visual Resources Collections," as they may be responsible for all "visual" materials for the study of a subject and include still and moving images in a variety of physical and virtual formats. They may contain:

* 35mm slides
* lantern slides
* mounted study photographs
* born digital images
* 35mm, 8mm film
Many educational institutions have changed the names of their slide libraries over the years, to a variety of titles like Visual Resources Center, Imaging &amp; AV Center, Digital Collections Center, etc. The titles and duties of slide librarians have therefore expanded greatly. As keepers of these important historical images, visual resources librarians have continuously [[Library catalog|cataloged]] and [[Archive|inventoried]] slide collections, circulated them to faculty for teaching, and more recently, [[Digitizing|digitized]] slides and placed them online via [[content management systems]]. 

== History of visual resources collections ==

The first American [[lantern slide]] collections, developed by [[museum]]s to reflect and augment their collections, got their start between 1860 and 1879: the American Natural History Museum, the New York State Military Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, and the Winterthur Museum. American colleges and universities began their collections during the same period of time: [[DePauw University]], [[Columbia University]], [[Oberlin College]], [[Princeton University]], [[University of Rochester]]. Colleges and university collections were used primarily for classroom instruction.

The first illustrated architectural history course west of the [[Mississippi]] was John Galen Howard's Architecture 5A-F at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1905.  The six-semester course was required for all architecture students, and like other architectural history courses of its time, at [[MIT]] and [[Cornell]] at least, were multi-year in duration. Of course, the lecture was illustrated by lantern slides.  In the U.S., lantern slides generally measured 3"x 4.25".

The 1950s was a period of transition from black and white lantern slides, which heretofore had often been hand colored, to color positive film.  Lantern slides were shot directly onto color film, and the 35mm slide (2"x2" with an image of 24mm x 36mm) gained in popularity.

The heyday of the lantern slide lasted one hundred years, more or less, from 1860 to 1960.  The reign of the 35mm slide, more or less, was about half as long, fifty years, 1955–2005.

== Timeline: Development of visual resources (collections and profession) in the U.S.==

1865. First lantern slide collections begin developing in the U.S. These 3.25" x 4.0" glass slides projected clearly with great detail. However, projectors required [[lime light]] which was dirty and dangerous
 
1887. First transparent, flexible nitrocellulose film base developed
 
1888. First perforated film stock developed
 
1889. Eastman combined nitrocellulose film stock, perforated edges, and dry-gelatino-bromide emulsion to create the first paperless film stock
 
1902. Court denies Eastman's exclusive patent, allowing any company to develop 35mm film

1905. UC Berkeley’s Architecture Library acquires its first lantern slide, the tree of architecture, made from Banister Fletcher’s book, ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''

1909. 35mm adopted as the international standard gauge by Motion Picture Patents Company, an Edison trust
 
1913. 35mm film format introduced into still photography
 
1925. Leica Camera introduced, using 35mm still film
 
1930.  Safety film introduced (cellulose diacetate)
 
1934-1936. Kodachrome 35mm slide film introduced, but not widely adopted by colleges and universities. Film stock was either flammable or brittle
 
1949. Kodak replaces all nitrate-based films with its safety film, a cellulose-triacetate base
 
1952. All camera film is now triacetate based, paving the way for widespread adoption of 35mm film in both amateur and academic markets

1952+ American faculty widely divided in their allegiances to lantern slides for their clarity or to 35mm slides for their ease of production and transport to class. Huge debates begin about whether 35mm color film is stable enough for adoption and whether the loss of clarity will ruin the teaching of art history. Younger faculty adopt 35mm film, while older faculty prefer lantern slides

[[File:Amaryllis stamens aka.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Stamens of a ''[[Hippeastrum]]'' with white filaments and prominent anthers carrying [[pollen]]]]

The '''stamen''' ([[plural]] ''stamina'' or ''stamens'') is the [[pollen]]-producing [[reproductive organ]] of a [[flower]]. Collectively the stamens form the '''androecium'''.&lt;ref name=Been10&gt;{{Citation |mode=cs1 |last=Beentje |first=Henk |year=2010 |title=The Kew Plant Glossary |publication-place=Richmond, Surrey |publisher=[[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] |isbn=978-1-84246-422-9 }}, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology and terminology==
A stamen typically consists of a stalk called the '''filament''' and an '''anther''' which contains ''[[sporangium|microsporangia]]''. Most commonly anthers are two-lobed and are attached to the filament either at the base or in the middle area of the anther. The sterile tissue between the lobes is called the '''connective'''. A pollen grain develops from a [[microspore]] in the microsporangium and contains the male [[gametophyte]].

The stamens in a flower are collectively called the '''androecium'''. The androecium can consist of as few as one-half stamen (i.e. a single [[locule]]) as in ''[[Canna (plant)|Canna]]'' species or as many as 3,482 stamens which have been counted in ''[[Carnegiea gigantea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Charles E. Bessey in SCIENCE Vol. 40 (November 6, 1914) p. 680.&lt;/ref&gt; The androecium in various species of plants forms a great variety of patterns, some of them highly complex.&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, R. 1973. ''Organogenesis of Flowers. A Photographic Text-Atlas''. University of Toronto Press. {{ISBN|0-8020-1864-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, R. 1988. A dynamic multidimensional approach to floral morphology. In: Leins, P., Tucker, S. C. and Endress, P. (eds) ''Aspects of Floral Development''. J. Cramer, Berlin, pp. 1-6. {{ISBN|3-443-50011-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greyson, R. I. 1994. ''The Development of Flowers''.

Schweizerbart Science Publishers, Stuttgart. {{ISBN|978-3-510-65261-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It generally surrounds the [[gynoecium]] and is surrounded by the [[perianth]]. A few members of the family [[Triuridaceae]], particularly ''[[Lacandonia schismatica]]'', are exceptional in that their gynoecia surround their androecia.

==Etymology==
* '''Stamen''' is the [[Latin]] word meaning "thread" (originally thread of the [[warp (weaving)|warp]], in weaving).&lt;ref name="Lewis &amp; Short"/&gt;
* '''Filament''' derives from [[classical Latin]] ''filum'', meaning "thread"&lt;ref name="Lewis &amp; Short"&gt;Lewis, C.T. &amp; Short, C. (1879). ''A Latin dictionary founded on Andrews' edition of Freund's Latin dictionary.'' Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variation in morphology==
[[File:Mature flower diagram.svg|thumb|right|Stamens, with distal anther attached to the filament stalk, in context of floral anatomy]]
Depending on the species of plant, some or all of the stamens in a flower may be attached to the petals or to the [[floral axis]]. They also may be free-standing or fused to one another in many different ways, including fusion of some but not all stamens. The filaments may be fused and the anthers free, or the filaments free and the anthers fused. Rather than there being two locules, one locule of a stamen may fail to develop, or alternatively the two locules may merge late in development to give a single locule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Goebel, K.E.v.|origyear=1905|year=1969|volume=Part 2 Special organography|title=Organography of plants, especially of the Archegoniatae and Spermaphyta|publisher=Hofner publishing company|location=New York|url=https://archive.org/details/organographyofpl02goeb}} pages 553–555&lt;/ref&gt; Extreme cases of stamen fusion occur in some species of ''[[Cyclanthera]]'' in the family [[Cucurbitaceae]] and in section ''Cyclanthera'' of genus ''[[Phyllanthus]]'' (family [[Euphorbiaceae]]) where the stamens form a ring around the gynoecium, with a single locule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rendle, A.B.|year=1925|title=The Classification of Flowering Plants|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521060578|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fuo8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA624&amp;lpg=PA624&amp;dq=%22cyclanthera+flower%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cyclanthera%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antera Lilium.jpg|thumb|right|Cross section of a ''Lilium'' stamen, with four locules surrounded by the tapetum]]

==Pollen production==
A typical anther contains four microsporangia. The ''microsporangia'' form sacs or pockets (''locules'') in the anther (anther sacs or pollen sacs). The two separate locules on each side of an anther may fuse into a single locule. Each microsporangium is lined with a nutritive tissue layer called the ''tapetum'' and initially contains diploid pollen mother cells. These undergo meiosis to form [[haploid]] spores. The spores may remain attached to each other in a tetrad or separate after meiosis. Each microspore then divides mitotically to form an immature [[Gametophyte|microgametophyte]] called a [[Pollen|pollen grain]].

The pollen is eventually released when the anther forms openings ([[dehiscence (botany)#Anther dehiscence|dehisces]]). These may consist of longitudinal slits, pores, as in the [[Erica|heath]] family ([[Ericaceae]]), or by valves, as in the [[barberry]] family ([[Berberidaceae]]). In some plants, notably members of [[Orchidaceae]] and [[Asclepiadoideae]], the pollen remains in masses called [[Pollinium|pollinia]], which are adapted to attach to particular pollinating agents such as birds or insects. More commonly, mature pollen grains separate and are dispensed by wind or water, pollinating insects, birds or other pollination vectors.

Pollen of angiosperms must be transported to the stigma, the receptive surface of the ''[[Gynoecium|carpel]]'', of a compatible flower, for successful [[pollination]] to occur. After arriving, the pollen grain (an immature microgametophyte) typically completes its development. It may grow a pollen tube and undergoing mitosis to produce two sperm nuclei.

== Sexual reproduction in plants ==
{{Main article|Sexual reproduction in plants}}
[[File:Phalaenopsis orchid-Stipe.jpg|thumb|right|Stamen with [[pollinia]] and its [[anther]] cap. ''[[Phalaenopsis]]'' orchid.]]
In the typical flower (that is, in the majority of flowering plant species) each flower has both '''[[Gynoecium|carpels]]''' and '''stamens'''. In some species, however, the flowers are unisexual with only carpels or stamens. ('''[[monoecious]]''' = both types of flowers found on the same plant; '''[[dioecious]]''' = the two types of flower found only on different plants). A flower with only stamens is called '''androecious'''. A flower with only carpels is called '''gynoecious'''.

A flower having only functional stamens and lacking functional carpels is called a '''staminate flower''', or (inaccurately) male.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica.com"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/461851/pistillate-flower Encyclopædia Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  A plant with only functional [[carpel]]s is called [[pistillate]], or (inaccurately) female.&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica.com"/&gt;

An abortive or rudimentary stamen is called a '''staminodium''' or '''[[staminode]]''', such as in ''[[Scrophularia|Scrophularia nodosa]]''.

The [[Gynoecium|carpels]] and stamens of [[orchid]]s are fused into a [[column (botany)|column]]. The top part of the column is formed by the anther, which is covered by an '''anther cap'''.

== Descriptive terms ==
[[File:Penta anther.jpg|thumb|right|Scanning electron microscope image of ''[[Pentas lanceolata]]'' anthers, with pollen grains on surface]]
[[File:Lily stamens.jpg|thumb|[[Lily]] stamens with prominent red anthers and white filaments]]
* A column formed from the fusion of multiple filaments is known as an '''''androphore'''''.

The anther can be attached to the filament's connective in two ways:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hickey, M. |author2=King, C. |year=1997|title=Common Families of Flowering Plants|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521576093|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nhQQho64fxYC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=basifixed+poricidal+dehiscence#v=onepage&amp;q=basifixed%20poricidal%20dehiscence&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''basifixed''': attached at its base to the filament
** '''pseudobasifixed''': a somewhat misnomer configuration where connective tissue extends in a tube around the filament
* '''dorsifixed''': attached at its center to the filament, usually '''versatile''' (able to move)
Stamens can be '''connate''' (fused or joined in the same whorl):
* '''extrorse''': anther [[Dehiscence (botany)|dehiscence]] directed away from the centre of the flower. Cf. '''introrse''', directed inwards, and '''latrorse''' towards the side.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SuUVYOFCTwYC William G. D'Arcy, Richard C. Keating (eds.) The Anther: Form, Function, and Phylogeny. Cambridge University Press, 1996] {{ISBN|9780521480635}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''monadelphous''': fused into a single, compound structure
* '''declinate''': curving downwards, then up at the tip (also – declinate-descending)
* '''diadelphous''': joined partially into two androecial structures
* '''pentadelphous''': joined partially into five androecial structures
* '''synandrous''': only the anthers are connate (such as in the [[Asteraceae]]). The fused stamens are referred to as a '''synandrium'''.
Stamens can also be '''adnate''' (fused or joined from more than one whorl):
* '''epipetalous''': adnate to the [[Corolla (flower)|corolla]]
* '''epiphyllous''': adnate to undifferentiated [[tepal]]s (as in many [[Liliaceae]])
They can have different lengths from each other:
* '''didymous''': two equal pairs
* '''didynamous''': occurring in two pairs, a long pair and a shorter pair
* '''tetradynamous''': occurring as a set of six stamens with four long and two shorter ones
or respective to the rest of the flower ([[perianth]]):

They may be arranged, with respect to the [[petals]]:
* '''diplostemonous''': in two [[Whorl (botany)|whorls]], the outer alternating with the petals, while the inner is opposite the petals.
* '''obdiplostemonous''': in two whorls, the outer opposite the petals

'''System integration testing''' ('''SIT''') involves the overall [[Test method|testing]] of a complete [[system]] of many [[subsystem]] components or elements.  The system under test may be composed of  [[Computer hardware|hardware]], or [[software]], or hardware with [[embedded software]], or hardware/software with [[human-in-the-loop]] testing. 

SIT consists, initially, of the "process of assembling the constituent parts of a system in a logical, cost-effective way, comprehensively checking system execution (all nominal &amp; exceptional paths), and including a full functional check-out."&lt;ref name=houser2011/&gt;  Following integration, system test is a process of "[[Verification and validation|verifying]] that the system meets its requirements, and [[Verification and validation|validating]] that the system performs in accordance with the customer or user expectations."&lt;ref name=houser2011&gt;
{{cite web |url=https://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2011system/13007_HouserThursday.pdf |title=Best Practices for Systems Integration |last=Houser |first=Pete |publisher=dtic.mil |date=November 2011 |accessdate=15 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- other definition's wording could be used, or this could be paraphrased, but this is a good overview of a standard textbook definition, and can be located on the web. --&gt;

In [[technology]] [[new product development|product development]], the beginning of system integration testing is often the first time that an entire system has been assembled such that it can be tested as a whole.  In order to make system testing most productive, the many constituent assemblies and subsystems will have typically gone through a subsystem test and successfully verified that each subsystem meets its requirements at the subsystem interface level. 

In the context of [[software system]]s and [[software engineering]], ''system integration testing'' is a testing process that exercises a software system's coexistence with others. With multiple integrated systems, assuming that each have already passed system testing,&lt;ref&gt;[http://istqbexamcertification.com/what-is-system-integration-testing/ What is System integration testing?]&lt;/ref&gt; SIT proceeds to test their required interactions. Following this, the [[deliverable]]s are passed on to acceptance testing.

== Software system integration testing ==
For [[software]] SIT is part of the [[software testing]] life cycle for collaborative projects. Usually, a round of SIT precedes the [[user acceptance test]] (UAT) round. Software providers usually run a pre-SIT round of tests before consumers run their SIT test cases.

For example, if an integrator (company) is providing an enhancement to a customer's existing solution, then they integrate the new application layer and the new database layer with the customer's existing application and database layers.
After the integration is complete, users use both the new part (extended part) and old part (pre-existing part) of the integrated application to update data. A process should exist to exchange data imports and exports between the two data layers. This data exchange process should keep both systems up-to-date. The purpose of system integration testing is to ensure all parts of these systems successfully co-exist and exchange data where necessary.

There may be more parties in the integration, for example the primary customer (consumer) can have their own customers; there may be also multiple providers.

=== Data driven method ===
{{howto|date=November 2011}}
A simple method of SIT which can be performed with minimum usage of software testing tools. Data imports and exports are exchanged before the behavior of each data field within each individual layer is investigated. After the software collaboration, there are three main states of data flow.

==== Data state within the integration layer ====
Integration layer can be a [[middleware]] or [[Web service|web service(s)]] which acts as a medium for data imports and data exports. Data imports and exports performance can be checked with the following steps:{{cn|date=March 2016}}
# Cross-checking of the data properties within the Integration layer with technical/business specification documents.
#* For web service involvement with the integration layer, WSDL and XSD can be used against web service request for the cross check.
#* Middleware involvement with the integration layer allows for [[data mapping]]s against middleware logs for the cross check.
# Execute some unit tests. Cross check the data mappings (data positions, declarations) and requests (character length, data types) with technical specifications.
# Investigate the server logs/middleware logs for troubleshooting.

Reading knowledge of [[WSDL]], [[XSD]], [[Document Type Definition|DTD]], [[XML]], and [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]] might be required for this.

==== Data state within the database layer ====
System integration testing of a database layer might proceed as follows:{{cn|date=March 2016}}

# First check whether all the data have committed to the database layer from the integration layer.
# Then check the data properties with the table and column properties with relevant to technical/business specification documents.
# Check the data validations/constrains with business specification documents.
# If there are any processing data within the database layer then check Stored Procedures with relevant specifications.
# Investigate the server logs for troubleshooting.

Knowledge in SQL and reading knowledge in [stored procedures] might be required for this{{according to whom|date=March 2016}}

==== Data state within the application layer ====

There is not that much to do with the application layer when we perform a system integration testing:{{cn|date=March 2016}}
# Mark all the fields from business requirement documents which should be visible in the UI.
# Create a data map from database fields to application fields and check whether necessary fields are visible in UI.
# Check data properties by some positive and negative test cases.

There are many combinations of data imports and export which we can perform by considering the time period for system integration testing. Testers must select best combinations to perform with the limited time and when repeat some of the steps to test those combinations.

'''''The Principles of Exercise Therapy''''' is a 1953 book by M. Dena Gardiner. 

==About the book==
The Principles of Exercise Therapy book is explained in detailed about exercises. Physical training is physical activity that improves physical condition and health. Physical training protects the health of a person and regulates the patient's health. Physical training mechanics plays a major medicine. Walking, running, swimming, ice skating, bicycling, playing, dance, yoga, and physical exercise are all physical exercises. Heart disease, diabetes and obesity can be controlled by exercise. The book also alleges that exercise helps to reduce mental retardation and reduce the risk of mental retardation in the exercise. It is essential to exercise immune organs or adequate vascular organs in a coherent blood circulation.

==Reception==
The ''[[British Journal of Occupational Therapy]]'' reviewed the book in 1954, stating that "Miss Gardiner is to be congratulated on an excellent piece of work which should prove invaluable to all engaged in the rehabilitation of the physically unfit."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=January 1, 1954|title=Book Review: The Principles of Exercise Therapy|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/030802265401700109|journal=British Journal of Occupational Therapy|volume=17|issue=1|pages=16-17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Physical Therapy (journal)|Physical Therapy]]'' also reviewed the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=December 1, 1954|title=The Principles of Exercise Therapy|url=https://academic.oup.com/ptj/article-abstract/34/12/649/4669090?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Physical Therapy|volume=34|issue=12|pages=649|doi=10.1093/ptj/34.12.649|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It differs from dissimilarity measures such as [[Bray-Curtis dissimilarity]] in that it incorporates information on the relative relatedness of community members by incorporating phylogenetic distances between observed organisms in the computation.

==Research methods==
The distance is calculated between pairs of samples (each sample represents an organismal community). All taxa found in one or both samples are placed on a phylogenetic tree. A branch leading to taxa from both samples is marked as "shared" and branches leading to taxa which appears only in one sample are marked as "unshared". The distance between the two samples is then calculated as (the sum of "unshared" branch lengths)/(the sum of all tree branch lengths (= shared+unshared)), i.e. the fraction of total branch length which is unshared. This definition satisfies the requirements of a [[distance metric]], being non-negative, zero only when entities are identical, transitive, and conformant to the [[triangle inequality]].

If there are several different samples, a distance matrix can be created, by making a tree for each pair of samples and calculating their UniFrac measure. Later, standard multivariate statistical methods such as [[data clustering]] and [[principal co-ordinates analysis]] can be used.

One can determine the statistical significance of the Unifrac distance between two  samples using [[Monte Carlo simulation]]s. By randomizing the sample classification of each taxa on the tree (leaving the branch structure unchanged) and creating a distribution of UniFrac distance values, one can obtain a distribution of UniFrac values. From this, a p-value can be given to the actual distance between the samples.

Additionally, there is a weighted version of the UniFrac metric which accounts for the relative abundance of each of the taxa within the communities. This is commonly used in [[metagenomic]] studies, where the number of metagenomic reads can be in the tens of thousands, and it is appropriate to 'bin' these reads into [[operational taxonomic unit]]s, or OTUs, which can then be dealt with as taxa within the UniFrac framework.

In 2012, a generalized UniFrac version,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; which unifies the weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance in a single framework, was proposed.  The weighted and unweighted UniFrac distance place too much weight on either abundant lineages or rare lineages. Their power to detect environmental influence is limited under some setting, where the moderately abundant lineages are mostly affected. The generalized UniFrac distance corrects the limitation of the weighted/weighted UniFrac distance by down-weighting their emphasis on either abundant or rare lineages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7055">In a [[database]], a '''view''' is the [[result set]] of a ''stored'' [[Query language|query]] on the [[data]], which the [[database]] users can query just as they would in a persistent database collection object. This pre-established query command is kept in the database dictionary. Unlike ordinary ''base tables'' in a [[relational database]], a view does not form part of the [[database design|physical schema]]: as a result set, it is a virtual table computed or collated dynamically from data in the database when access to that view is requested. Changes applied to the data in a relevant ''underlying table'' are reflected in the data shown in subsequent invocations of the view. In some [[NoSQL]] databases, views are the only way to query data.

Views can provide advantages over tables:
* Views can represent a subset of the data contained in a table. Consequently, a view can limit the degree of exposure of the underlying tables to the outer world: a given user may have permission to query the view, while denied access to the rest of the base table.
* Views can [[Join (SQL)|join]] and simplify multiple tables into a single virtual table.
* Views can act as aggregated tables, where the [[database engine]] aggregates data ([[summation|sum]], [[average]], etc.) and presents the calculated results as part of the data.
* Views can hide the complexity of data. For example, a view could appear as Sales2000 or Sales2001, transparently [[Partition (database)|partitioning]] the actual underlying table.
* Views take very little space to store; the database contains only the definition of a view, not a copy of all the data that it presents.
* Depending on the [[SQL]] engine used, views can provide extra security.

Just as a [[function (computing)|function]] (in programming) can provide [[Abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]], so can a database view. In another parallel with functions, database users can manipulate nested views, thus one view can aggregate data from other views. Without the use of views, the [[Database normalization|normalization]] of databases above [[second normal form]] would become much more difficult. Views can make it easier to create lossless join decomposition.

Just as [[Row (database)|rows]] in a base table lack any defined ordering, rows available through a view do not appear with any default sorting.  A view is a relational table, and the relational model defines a table as a set of rows. Since sets are not ordered &amp;mdash; by definition &amp;mdash; neither are the rows of a view. Therefore, an [[order by (SQL)|ORDER BY]] clause in the view definition is meaningless; the SQL standard ([[SQL:2003]]) does not allow an ORDER BY clause in the subquery of a CREATE VIEW command, just as it is refused in a CREATE TABLE statement. However, sorted data can be obtained from a view, in the same way as any other table &amp;mdash; as part of a query [[Statement (programming)|statement]] on that view. Nevertheless, some DBMS (such as [[Oracle Database]]) do not abide by this SQL standard restriction.

== Read-only vs. updatable views ==
Database practitioners can define views as [[file system permissions|read-only]] or updatable.  If the database system can determine the reverse mapping from the view schema to the schema of the underlying base tables, then the view is updatable.  [[Insert (SQL)|INSERT]], [[Update (SQL)|UPDATE]], and [[Delete (SQL)|DELETE]] operations can be performed on updatable views.  Read-only views do not support such operations because the DBMS cannot map the changes to the underlying base tables.  A view update is done by key preservation.

Some systems support the definition of INSTEAD OF [[Database trigger|triggers]] on views.  This technique allows the definition of other logic for execution in place of an insert, update, or delete operation on the views.  Thus database systems can implement data modifications based on read-only views. However, an INSTEAD OF trigger does not change the read-only or updatable property of the view itself.

==Materialized views==
{{details|Materialized view}}

Various [[database management system]]s have extended the views from read-only subsets of [[data]], particularly [[materialized view]]s: pre-executed, non-virtual views commonly used in [[Data warehouse|data warehousing]]. They give a static snapshot of the data and may include data from remote sources. The accuracy of a materialized view depends on the frequency of trigger mechanisms behind its updates.

Materialized views were introduced by [[Oracle Database]], while [[IBM DB2]] provides so-called "materialized query tables" (MQTs) for the same purpose. [[Microsoft SQL Server]] introduced in its 2000 version indexed views which only store a separate index from the table, but not the entire data. [[PostgreSQL]] implemented materialized views in its 9.3 release.

== Equivalence ==

A view is equivalent to its source query. When queries are run against views, the query is modified. For example, if there exists a view named accounts_view with the content as follows:

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
accounts_view:
-------------
SELECT name,
       money_received,
       money_sent,
       (money_received - money_sent) AS balance,
       address,
	   ...
  FROM table_customers c 
  JOIN accounts_table a 
    ON a.customer_id = c.customer_id
&lt;/source&gt;

then the application could run a simple query such as:

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
Simple query
------------
SELECT name,
       balance
  FROM accounts_view
&lt;/source&gt;

The RDBMS then takes the simple query, replaces the equivalent view, then sends the following to the [[query optimizer]]:

&lt;source lang="sql"&gt;
Preprocessed query:
------------------
SELECT name,
       balance
  FROM (SELECT name,
               money_received,
               money_sent,
               (money_received - money_sent) AS balance,
               address,
			    ...
          FROM table_customers c JOIN accounts_table a
               ON a.customer_id = c.customer_id        )
&lt;/source&gt;

The optimizer then removes unnecessary fields and complexity (for example: it is not necessary to read the address, since the parent invocation does not make use of it) and then sends the query to the SQL engine for processing.

{{Infobox Observatory}}
The '''Warkworth Radio Astronomical Observatory''' is located just south of [[Warkworth, New Zealand]], off [[New Zealand State Highway 1|State Highway 1]], about 50&amp;nbsp;km north of Auckland.  It is operated by the Institute for Radio Astronomy and Space Research, [[Auckland University of Technology]]. The [[Warkworth Radio Telescope|WARK12M 12m Radio Telescope]] was constructed in 2008. In 2010, a licence to operate the New Zealand Telecom 30m dish was granted, which led to the construction of the [[Warkworth 2 dish|WARK30M 30m Radio Telescope]]. First observations with the Australian Long Baseline Array took place in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;D., Dickey, 3 March 2011, Rodney Times,p.11, Warkworth in control as telescopes link up.A historic link-up of six Australian radio telescope sites with the Warkworth Radio Observatory could be the start of a very fast broadband speed.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Hydrogen maser]] is installed on-site for very accurate time required by VLBI observations. The observatory has a 1Gbit/s connection to the [[Kiwi Advanced Research and Education Network]], providing high speed data transfers for files and e-VLBI.&lt;ref&gt;Weston, S., Natusch, T., Gulyaev, S., 2010, in Proceedings of

[[File:Golden hour graph.png|thumb|upright=1.6|Critical windows in emergency medicine]]

A '''window of opportunity''' (also called a '''margin of opportunity''' or '''critical window''') is a period of time during which some action can be taken that will achieve a desired outcome. Once this period is over, or the "window has closed", the specified outcome is no longer possible.&lt;ref name="Sull"/&gt;

==Examples==
Examples of windows of opportunity include:
*The '''[[critical period]]''' in the development of an organism, during which [[neuroplasticity]] is greatest and key neurological functions, such as [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] and [[language]], are acquired which may be impossible to acquire at a later stage&lt;ref name="Robson"/&gt;
*The '''[[golden hour (medicine)|golden hour]]''' or '''golden time''', used in [[emergency medicine]] to describe the period following traumatic injury in which life-saving treatment is likely to be successful&lt;ref name="ACS"/&gt;
*'''[[Market opportunity|Market opportunities]]''', in which one may be positioned to take advantage of a gap in a particular [[market (economics)|market]],&lt;ref name="boundless"/&gt;&lt;ref name="investopedia"/&gt; the timing of which may depend on the activities of customers, competitors, and other market context factors&lt;ref name="Sull"/&gt;
*'''[[Sowing|Planting]] and [[harvest]]ing seasons''', in agriculture
*'''Space [[launch window|launch]] and [[orbital maneuver|maneuver]] windows''', which are determined by [[orbital dynamics]] and constrained by [[rocket propellant|fuel]]/[[delta-v]] budgets&lt;ref name="Heiney"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wheeler"/&gt;
*The theorized '''[[tipping point (climatology)|tipping point]]''' in climatology, after which the Earth's climate is predicted to shift to a new stable equilibrium&lt;ref name="ipcc"/&gt;

==Variations==
===Timing===
The length of a critical window may be well known (as in the case of launch windows) or poorly known (in the case of medical emergencies or climate change). In some cases, there may be multiple windows during which a goal can be achieved.

===Automation===
In situations with very brief or unpredictable windows of opportunity, [[automation]] may be employed to take advantage of these windows, as in [[algorithmic trading]].&lt;ref name="Lin"/&gt; [[Real-time computing]] systems can guarantee responses on the order of milliseconds or less.&lt;ref name="Ben-Ari-pg164"/&gt;

===Costs===
In some time-critical situations, failure to act may entail a continuously increasing cost over time, or a continuously decreasing probability over time of achieving the desired outcome. This may be represented in real-time computing systems by [[time-utility function]]s.

===Use as a marketing tactic===
In some cases, critical windows may be artificially imposed (or even falsely implied) as a [[marketing]] tactic to encourage action, in what is known as a "limited time offer".&lt;ref name="adage"/&gt;
