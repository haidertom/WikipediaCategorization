{{Advanced Placement}}

'''Advanced Placement World History''' (also known as '''AP World History''', '''WHAP''', '''AP World''' or '''APWH''') is a college-level course and examination offered to high school students through the [[College Board|College Board's]] [[Advanced Placement|Advanced Placement Program]] designed to help students develop a greater understanding of the evolution of global processes and contacts as well as interactions between different types of human society. The course advances this understanding through a combination of selective factual knowledge and appropriate analytical skills. Students study all prehistory and history, especially from 8000 [[Common Era|BC]]E to the present day. It was announced in July 2018 that the test would be changed to an AP World History: Modern exam that only contains content since 1200 CE, starting in the 2019-2020 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-world-history/course/2019-20-changes|title=SA:WH:2019-20 AP World History Changes|work=AP Central|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AP World History exam was first administered in 2002. The course has undergone multiple changes with the latest changes effective Fall 2017. Often times in the United States, students take the course in their sophomore year of high school, but this is not a requirement.

==Course Structure==

The multiple choice section is weighted as 40% of one's  total score (Section I Part A). It consists of 55 questions to be answered in 55 minutes based on the accompanying sources.

While previously the exam deducted 1/4 of a point for every incorrect answer, starting from 2011 on, the penalty for incorrect answers had been removed. It is to one's advantage to attempt every question possible within the time limit.  Note also that the number of multiple choice options is being reduced from five to four at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AP World History Course and Exam Description|url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/AP_WorldHistoryCED_Effective_Fall_2011.pdf|publisher=College Board}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This test underwent a major re-haul for the 2017 exam, however, due to the prodigious number of students that struggled with the free response section, the College Board decided to initiate yet another round of sweeping reform, to be put in effect in May 2018. Currently it has the same format as [[Advanced Placement United States History]] and [[Advanced Placement European History]]. The exam features a new section (Section I Part B) that requires three short answer questions, one of which is selected from two options. Each question has three parts, making for a total of 9 parts within the SAQ section. Students have forty minutes to answer these, and they count for twenty percent of the exam score.

Section II lasts for a total of 100 minutes, and it includes a document-based question (DBQ) and a long essay question (LEQ). Students are allowed to work on either essay within this total time period. The section begins with a 15-minute reading period where students are advised to read both the documents for DBQ. However, students may begin writing during this time; most students take notes on the documents in order to plan out the DBQ. Students are advised to spend 45 minutes writing the DBQ and then 40 writing the LEQ, but there are no rules on when each essay must be worked on. There are three prompts for the LEQ, but only one needs to be chosen. Each LEQ prompt addresses a different period, with one addressing periods 1 &amp; 2, another addressing periods 3 &amp; 4, and a third addressing periods 5 &amp; 6.

The DBQ counts for 25% of the total exam score, and the LEQ is 15%. The essays are out of seven points and six points, respectively. Students are required to analyze and synthesize the documents of the DBQ, but some outside information is still needed. The LEQ only provides a prompt and no sort of stimulus, so a large amount of outside information is necessary.

In 2012, the head of AP Grading, Trevor Packer, stated that the reason for the low percentages of 5s is that "AP World History is a college-level course, &amp; many sophomores aren't yet writing at that level." 10.44 percent of all seniors who took the exam in 2012 received a 5, while 6.62 percent of sophomores received a 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AP_Trevor/status/215559243930144770|title=Trevor Packer|work=Twitter|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfred University''' is a small, comprehensive university in the [[Alfred (village), New York|Village of Alfred]], [[Allegany County, New York|Allegany County]] in [[Western New York|Western]] [[New York (state)|New York]], United States, south of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]] and southeast of [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]. Alfred has an undergraduate population of around 2,000, and approximately 300 graduate students. The institution has five schools and colleges.

==Background==
Alfred was founded in 1836 as the '''Select School''' by [[Seventh Day Baptists]] as a [[non-sectarian]] institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://herr.alfred.edu/special/archives/univ_hist/history_of_au.cfm |title=History of AU |publisher=Herr.alfred.edu |date=October 25, 1990 |accessdate=April 15, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312100609/http://herr.alfred.edu/special/archives/univ_hist/history_of_au.cfm |archive-date=March 12, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual for the time, the school was [[co-educational]]. It was also racially integrated, and enrolled its first African-American student and two Native American students in the 1850s, becoming the second college in the nation after [[Berea College]] in Berea, Kentucky, to do so.

The origin of the name "Alfred" is uncertain. Residents of the town and students at the two schools believe that the town received its name in honor of [[Alfred the Great]], king of the Saxons, although the first documented occurrence of this connection was in 1881, 73 years after the first record of the name being used to describe the geophysical area during assignments by the state legislature. State records which might have verified the connection between the Saxon king and the university were lost in a fire in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alfred's Town Name |url=http://www.herr.alfred.edu/special/archives/histories/alfreds_town_name.asp |accessdate=August 12, 2007 |first=Susan |last=Strong |year=1997 |work=Herrick Library Special Collections and Archives |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070719034206/http://www.herr.alfred.edu/special/archives/histories/alfreds_town_name.asp |archivedate=July 19, 2007 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of whether the connection is historically accurate, Alfred University has embraced King Alfred as a [[symbol]] of the school's values, and a statue of the king stands in the center of the campus quad.

Since its founding, Alfred University has hosted guest lecturers, artists and musicians from [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=E. H.|title=Allen of Alfred: Some of His Words|year=2007|publisher=Kessinger Press|isbn=978-0-548-05765-0|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Ghostface Killah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community: Events: Hot Dog Day 2011|url=http://www.alfred.edu/community/hdd.cfm|work=Alfred University Website|publisher=AU ITS|accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2000, Alfred University received national attention when freshman, Eric Zuckerman, orchestrated a campus visit from then–First Lady, [[Hillary Clinton]], during her campaign for the United States Senate.&lt;ref&gt;http://dspace.alfred.edu/bitstream/handle/10829/3023/20000503.pdf?sequence=1{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred University, together with [[Corning Incorporated]] and the State of [[New York (state)|New York]] created the [[Ceramic Corridor]], a high-tech incubator project designed to take advantage of the emerging ceramics industry and to create new jobs. This unique industrial development program is the only one in the United States concentrating on one single aspect of technology – high-tech ceramics – and it is the only major industrial development project centered in a rural area in the U.S.

Extending to the 20th and 21st centuries, Alfred has continued its progressive history of defending equal rights for members of the community. In 1971, Alfred became only the fourth municipality in the U.S. to ban employment discrimination based on sexuality. In the mid-1990s, the university became one of the first to strip credit for ROTC programs, which exhibit prejudice on basis of sexual orientation. However, students attending Alfred University are still free to receive an Army ROTC contract with full tuition paid and attend military science classes through St. Bonaventure University. Amidst the dissolution of the AU Greek System, the [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity chapter at Alfred University led an overwhelmingly successful effort to ban discrimination based on religion, age, disability, and sexual orientation in the constitution of the 210 chapter international fraternity in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Brotherhood: Gay Life in College Fraternities | first = Shane L. | last = Windmeyer | publisher = Alyson Publications | year = 1998 | isbn = 1-55583-409-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That action triggered several other national fraternities and sororities to follow suit.

==History==
[[File:Kanakadea Hall at Alfred University.jpg|thumb|right|Originally built in 1884, Kanakadea Hall served as Alfred's schoolhouse until a large fire destroyed the tower and devastated the second floor in 1907. It was sold to Alfred University and repaired in 1908. The exterior has since been restored to its original appearance, although the interior has been fully modernized. The building now houses the Division of Human Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Edward G. Coll and Carole Hulse Coll Center at Kanakadea | url = http://alfred.edu/map/kanakadea.html | accessdate =April 27, 2008 | author = Alfred University | work = Alfred University Campus Map}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Statue of King Alfred at Alfred University.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The statue of King Alfred stands at the center of AU's quad, and is often decorated by students.

Alfred University is not to be confused with the [[Alfred State College]]. Although autonomous, both institutions have their origins in the Alfred Select School, and were heavily shaped by Boothe C. Davis. In 1908 Davis petitioned the New York State Legislature to fund the New York State College of Agriculture at Alfred University.

In 1941 Alfred State College became an autonomous junior college due to increased enrollment and increasing needs, which Alfred University could not accommodate, and in 1948 became a member of the State University of New York (SUNY) system. Students of both schools still share a few Alfred peculiarities including: a physical education requirement for most programs, a short break in October dubbed "minibreak", sharing of clubs and organizations (excluding Greek lettered organizations), and cross-registration of classes not offered at the other institution.

==Mascot, events and culture==

Alfred University's mascot is the [[Saxon people|Saxon]], a [[knight]] in shining armor. Since the year 871 is when King Alfred the Great succeeded his brother, [[Æthelred of Wessex|Ethelred I]] as King of [[Wessex]] and [[Mercia]] (see [[Alfred the Great#Childhood|Alfred the Great's childhood]]), the [[telephone exchange]] of Alfred University is 871 (i.e., all AU phone numbers take the form 1-607-871-xxxx).

[[Hot dog day|Hot Dog Day]] is held in early April of each year since 1972 at Alfred to raise money for local charities and community-based civic organizations. It is a joint project with [[Alfred State College]] coordinated by students and staff from both schools. Typical events include a carnival, small amusement park rides, mud olympics, concerts, a parade, and the consumption of hot dogs. In recent years approximately $7,000 to $8,000 has been raised for charities including the local fire departments, public library, and day care centers.

Alfred's [http://www.alfred.edu/map/carillon.html Davis Memorial Carillon], erected in 1937 as a tribute to longtime president [http://www.herr.alfred.edu/special/archives/people/davis.shtml Boothe C. Davis], can often be heard while on campus. The bells of the [[carillon]], purchased from [[Antwerp]], were thought to be the oldest bells in the western hemisphere. Research later (2004) showed that the bells were of a more recent vintage, and that Alfred had been the victim of a fraud. On the brighter side, the non-historic nature of the bells allows the university to replace those that have poor tonal quality. Concerts continue four times a week when school is in session (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 12:30&amp;nbsp;pm and Saturday at 4&amp;nbsp;pm), and during the summer months at least once a week. Besides the resident carilloneur, guest carilloneurs have in the past frequently visited and played during the summer.

The Black Knight&lt;ref&gt;[http://herrick.alfred.edu/special/archives/traditions/black_knight_story.shtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126004757/http://herrick.alfred.edu/special/archives/traditions/black_knight_story.shtml |date=November 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has been a part of Alfred University folklore for a long time. The relic was originally part of a parlor stove in a classroom in Kanakadea Hall. When the stove was discarded, the figure was claimed by the Class of 1908 as their mascot. They passed it on to the Class of 1910, thus causing a "war of possession" between the even and odd numbered classes. Many times over the years it disappeared and re-appeared on campus. After a particularly long time away it was returned in 1977 and placed in the University Archives. In 2005 it was transferred to a glass case in the Powell Campus Center along with a plaque describing its history. Many students had heard of the Black Knight during their freshmen orientation and were delighted to have him on display. However, after only a few months, the glass enclosure was destroyed in the middle of the night and the Black Knight stolen.

Alfred University was mentioned on [[Saturday Night Live]] once in 1975 by host and Alfred University alumnus [[Robert Klein]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75eklein.phtml |title=SNL Transcripts: Robert Klein: 11/15/75: Robert Klein |publisher=Snltranscripts.jt.org |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Klein hosted SNL again in 1977, he talked at length about Alfred University in his monologue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/77/77jmono.phtml |title=SNL Transcripts: Robert Klein: 01/21/78: Robert Klein's Monologue |publisher=Snltranscripts.jt.org |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
[[File:Miller Performing Arts Center at Alfred University.jpg|thumb|right|The Miller Performing Arts Center]]
[[File:Alfred University Powell Campus Center.jpg|thumb|right|The Powell Campus Center]]

Alfred is especially well known for its programs in ceramic art, ceramic engineering, glass engineering, and has a strong astronomy program due in part to the presence on campus of the 7-telescope [[Stull Observatory]], which has one of the largest optical telescope in [[New York (state)|New York state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://las.alfred.edu/physics |title=Alfred University - College of Liberal Arts and Sciences - Physics &amp; Astronomy |publisher=Las.alfred.edu |date= |accessdate=April 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Asteroid [[31113 Stull]] was named for John Stull, founder and caretaker of the observatory.

There are two libraries on Alfred's campus, the [http://www.herr.alfred.edu/ Herrick Memorial Library], which primarily serves the private colleges, and the [http://scholes.alfred.edu/ Scholes Library], which primarily serves the New York State College of Ceramics. The Alfred Ceramic Art Museum has a collection of 8,000 ceramic objects, including both ancient and modern ceramic art and craft.

The Bromley-Daggett Equestrian Center, located at the Maris Cuneo Equine Park, was constructed in 2005. It hosts equine classes, an intramural equestrian team, varsity and JV for both [[English riding|English]] and [[Western riding|Western]] disciplines, clinics, and horse shows. Stalls are available for boarding by university students. The facility has an indoor arena of 16000&amp;nbsp;ft² and lighted outdoor arenas of {{convert|28800|and|10800|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}; the entire property consists of {{convert|400|acre|km2}} of land.

The Miller Performing Arts Center was dedicated in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Miller Performing Arts Center wins international recognition | url = http://www.alfred.edu/pressreleases/viewrelease.cfm?ID=1511 | accessdate =September 17, 2007 | publisher = Alfred University | date = February 5, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alumni Hall===
[[File:AlumniHall2004.JPG|thumb|Alumni Hall]]
Now used primarily to house the Admissions Department, [[Alumni Hall (Alfred, New York)|Alumni Hall]] has a place on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The former University academy building, with cathedral ceilings, and offices far up into the cupola is a beautiful example of 19th-century American architecture in Alfred. In the 1990s, Alumni Hall was saved through a restoration effort. Alfred University was once associated with the Seventh Day Baptist Church, and included a school of theology. While the religious connection no longer exists, the architecture of Alumni Hall and other buildings on campus reflect this heritage.

==Colleges and schools==
Alfred University offers over 60 majors and areas of concentration at its four colleges and schools. Alfred's four private colleges are [http://las.alfred.edu/ The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences], [http://ps.alfred.edu/ The College of Professional Studies], [http://engineering.alfred.edu/ The Inamori School of Engineering], and [http://www.alfred.edu/gradschool The Graduate School]. [http://business.alfred.edu/ The School of Business] is part of The College of Professional Studies.

The [[New York State College of Ceramics]] (NYSCC) consists of the School of Art and Design, with its own dean, and four state-supported materials programs cross-organized within Alfred University's School of Engineering. The College of Ceramics is functioning technically as a "holding entity" for the fiscal support of the state programs and the NYSCC mission. The unit head assists with budget preparation for the two aforementioned AU schools and the NYSCC-affiliated Scholes Library of Ceramics (part of the campuswide, unified AU library system), and acts in a liaison role to SUNY.

The School of Art and Design, technically a sub-unit of the College of Ceramics but autonomously run with its own dean, is further subdivided into divisions. A visit to the school in 2009 led media historian Siegfried Zielinski to state that Alfred is "the center of alchemy for the 21st century."&lt;ref&gt;Edizel, Gerar (2009). "Process is Concept", p.3. St Vincent Press, Rochester, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Alfred's School of Engineering (also autonomously run with its own dean) currently has four state-supported programs and two privately endowed programs.

==Museums and galleries==

Alfred University and The New York State College of Ceramics (NYSCC) are associated with five galleries: [[Alfred Ceramic Art Museum]], The Cohen Center for the Arts Gallery, The Fosdick-Nelson Gallery, Robert C. Turner Gallery, and Institute for Electronic Art's (IEA) John Woods Studios. Other mentionable exhibition spaces for undergraduate and graduate students to show work include the Sculpture Dimensional Studies Exhibition Spaces (the Cube, the Box and the Cell Space), the Printmaking Critique Room, Flex Space, the New Deal, and Rhodes Room. Work from permanent collections are also on exhibition in the Saxon Inn and around campus in the offices of faculty.

===The Robert C. Turner Gallery===
Alfred University's student-run gallery, the Robert C. Turner Gallery was founded in 2011. The gallery has two floors; the main space and the catwalk in which also has the "black box" interactive space for expanded (electronic) media. This gallery space is named after Internationally acclaimed artist and Alfred University alumnus, [[Robert Chapman Turner|Robert C. Turner]]. Turner was a professor of ceramic art at Alfred University with a sixty-year-long career in ceramics. Turner once said,&lt;ref&gt;"What part, if any, can and should the art world play in revitalizing people of a perhaps degenerative culture, a culture in which people seem to be morally soft, often, and unaware of their actions, insensitive to the moral religious values in situations. Have not art and those people who know its value more to say than they have said, not only to make art a more vital and integral part of community life, but to minister to the spiritual needs in the broadest sense of the term?"&lt;/ref&gt;

===IEA John Wood Studios===

NYSCC is host to the John Wood Studios of the Institute of Electronic Arts (IEA) within the School of Art and Design (SoAD), NYSCC which offers a residency program for up to two weeks for international artists.

===Greek social organizations===
{{further|List of hazing deaths in the United States}}
Fraternities and sororities were established at Alfred University for nearly 100 years prior to 2002, when they were discontinued, partially in response to the death of [[Zeta Beta Tau]] (ZBT) fraternity member Benjamin Klein under suspicious circumstances and charges of gross negligence on behalf of the fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Alfred University implements new requirements for Greek organizations | url = http://www.alfred.edu/pressreleases/viewrelease.cfm?ID=1042 | accessdate =August 12, 2007 | publisher = Alfred University | date = February 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eliminating_frats"&gt;{{cite press release | title = Alfred University trustees vote to eliminate fraternities and sororities | url = http://www.alfred.edu/pressreleases/viewrelease.cfm?ID=1701 | accessdate =August 12, 2007 | publisher = Alfred University | date = May 20, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Klein's death in 1978, student [[Chuck Stenzel]] died in a [[hazing]]-related incident at Alfred's Klan Alpine fraternity. After Stenzel's death, his mother, Eileen Stevens, created a lobbying organization to increase awareness of hazing and promote anti-hazing laws, as documented in Hank Nuwer's book "Broken Pledges" and a later TV movie of the same name (in which Alfred was not named for legal reasons). Stevens later served as an advisor to Alfred on hazing-related issues, and received an honorary doctorate from the school in 1999.

During the summer of 2002, all [[Fraternities and sororities|Greek social organizations]] lost recognition after an in-depth analysis of the Alfred University Greek system by an eight-member task force appointed by the Board of Trustees. More than 50% of the task force were themselves members of a fraternity or sorority while in college, and 82% of the Board of Trustees are Alfred University alumni.&lt;ref name="eliminating_frats"/&gt;

At the time of closing in 2002, the Greek system at Alfred University included national and international fraternities [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], since 1909, [[Sigma Alpha Mu]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Alpha Chi Rho]], [[Delta Sigma Phi]], and [[Zeta Beta Tau]]; as well as local fraternities Kappa Psi Upsilon, and Klan Alpine. The sororities included [[Delta Zeta]], Theta Theta Chi, Alpha Kappa Omicron, and Sigma Chi Nu. The overall Greek community made significant contributions to Alfred University, Alfred, NY, and the surrounding communities, such as annual food drives that raised more than {{convert|2000|lb|abbr=on}} of food each fall for the Hornell food bank. Hot Dog Day Weekend, one of the largest and most successful community gatherings in Alfred,  was created by the brothers of Lambda Chi Alpha, as a way to raise money for charity efforts.  The event was organized and run by the fraternities and sororities at Alfred University for nearly 30 years. Many of the societies have highly active alumni associations, some of which gather at Alfred University reunions, or at independent functions.

===Other organizations===
[[Alpha Phi Omega]] is still recognized, as are academic fraternities, because they do not fall under the same category of restrictions as social fraternities. {{As of|2010}}, Alfred has over 90 student organizations and clubs.&lt;ref name=so&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alfred.edu/students/involvement/clubs_organizations.cfm|title=Student Life: Clubs and Organizations|publisher=Alfred University|accessdate=December 23, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101119094212/http://alfred.edu/students/involvement/clubs_organizations.cfm| archivedate= November 19, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student media include: AU TV, the Kanakadea Yearbook, and WALF 89.7FM.&lt;ref name=so/&gt;

AU has been granted chapters of a number of [[honor society|honor societies]], including [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] (the Alpha Gamma chapter of New York, granted in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Phi Beta Kappa at Alfred University | date = March 2006 | publisher = Alfred University | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Phi Kappa Phi]], and [[Alpha Lambda Delta]]; Alfred also has chapters of the service societies [[Alpha Phi Omega]] and [[Omicron Delta Kappa]]. Other honor societies include [[Alpha Iota Delta]], [[Beta Gamma Sigma]], [[Delta Mu Delta]], [[Omicron Delta Epsilon]], [[Pi Gamma Mu]], [[Pi Mu Epsilon]] (the Alpha Iota chapter of New York, chartered in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mathematics: Student Organizations | publisher = Alfred University | accessdate =December 17, 2008 | url = http://las.alfred.edu/math/organizations.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Pi Sigma Alpha]], [[Sigma Tau Delta]], [[Tau Beta Pi]], [[Phi Alpha Theta]], [[Phi Sigma Iota]], [[Psi Chi]], Keramos, and the [[Financial Management Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Honor Societies | accessdate =December 17, 2008 | publisher = Alfred University | url = http://alfred.edu/honors/societies.cfm| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081221172218/http://www.alfred.edu/honors/societies.cfm| archivedate= December 21, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athletics===
{{Main|Alfred Saxons}}
Alfred teams participate as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]], with the exception of alpine skiing which is governed by the [[United States Collegiate Ski and Snowboard Association|USCSA]] and the equestrian team which is governed by the IHSA. The Saxons are a member of the [[Empire 8 Athletic Conference]] (Empire 8). They compete in the following sports: alpine skiing, basketball, cross country, equestrian, football, lacrosse, soccer, swimming and diving, tennis, and track and field, women's volleyball, and women's softball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saxons.alfred.edu/|title=Alfred University Saxons|accessdate=December 13, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223232112/http://saxons.alfred.edu/|archivedate=December 23, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1154">'''Automatism''', in [[toxicology]], refers to a tendency to take a drug over and over again, forgetting each time that one has already taken the dose. This can lead to a cumulative overdose. A particular example is [[barbiturates]] which were once commonly used as [[hypnotic]] (sleep inducing) drugs. Among the current hypnotics, [[benzodiazepines]], especially [[midazolam]] might show marked automatism, possibly through their intrinsic [[anterograde amnesia]] effect. Barbiturates are known to induce [[hyperalgesia]], i.e. aggravation of pain and for sleeplessness due to pain, if barbiturates are used, more pain and more disorientation would follow leading to drug automation and finally a "pseudo"suicide. Such reports dominated the medical literature of 1960s and 1970s; a reason replacing the barbiturates with benzodiazepines when they became available.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Family Health, edition 3, from Marshall Cavendish&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lexicon of Psychiatry, Neurology, and the Neurosciences by Frank J Ayd from Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2000

[[File:The Scientific Universe.png|thumb|450px|The scale of the Universe mapped to branches of science and the [[hierarchy of the sciences|hierarchy of the sciences]].]]

The '''branches of science''', also referred to as [[Science|sciences]], "scientific fields", or "scientific disciplines," are commonly divided into three major groups:

*'''[[Formal science|Formal sciences]]''': the study of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], which use an ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', as opposed to [[fact]]ual, [[methodology]].
*'''[[Natural science]]s''': the study of natural phenomena (including cosmological, geological, chemical, and biological factors of the universe)
*'''[[Social science]]s''': the study of [[human behavior]] and [[Society|societies]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Social science|Social Science]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=March 2018}}

Natural and social sciences are [[empirical]] sciences, meaning that the knowledge must be based on observable phenomena and must be capable of being verified by other researchers working under the same conditions.
{{sfn|Popper|2002|p=20}} This verifiability may well vary even ''within'' a scientific discipline &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author=Davide Castelvecchi, Nature Magazine | date=2015-12-23 | url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-string-theory-science/ | title=Is String Theory science? | publisher=Scientific American | accessdate=2018-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author=Editorial Staff | date=2016-03-03 | url=https://www.nature.com/news/psychology-s-reproducibility-problem-is-exaggerated-say-psychologists-1.19498 | title=Psychology's reproducibility problem | publisher=Nature | accessdate=2018-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural, social, and formal science make up the [[fundamental science]]s, which form the basis of [[interdisciplinary]] and applied sciences such as [[engineering]] and [[medicine]]. Specialized scientific disciplines that exist in multiple categories may include parts of other scientific disciplines but often possess their own terminologies and expertises.&lt;ref&gt;see: {{Cite web| author=Editorial Staff | date=March 7, 2008 | url=http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2007/03/scientific_method_relationship.php | title=Scientific Method: Relationships among Scientific Paradigms | publisher=Seed magazine | accessdate=2007-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|limit=3}}

== Natural/Pure Science ==
{{Main article|Natural science|Outline of natural science}}

Natural science is a branch of [[science]] that seeks to [[wiktionary:elucidate|elucidate]] the rules that govern the [[nature|natural]] world by applying an [[Empirical method|empirical]] and [[scientific method]] to the study of the [[universe]]. The term natural sciences is used to distinguish it from the [[social sciences]], which apply the scientific method to study [[human behavior]] and [[social]] [[patterns]]; the [[humanities]], which use a [[critical theory|critical]], or [[Analytic philosophy|analytical approach]] to the study of the [[human condition]]; and the [[formal sciences]].

=== Physical science ===
{{Main article|Physical science|Outline of physical science}}

Physical science is an encompassing term for the branches of natural science and science that study non-living systems, in contrast to the life sciences. However, the term "physical" creates an unintended, somewhat arbitrary distinction, since many branches of physical science also study biological phenomena. There is a difference between physical science and physics.

==== Physics ====

''Physics''(from {{lang-grc|φύσις|[[physis]]|nature}}) is a [[natural science]] that involves the study of [[matter]]&lt;ref name = "feynman"&gt;
[[Richard Feynman]] begins [[The Feynman Lectures on Physics|his ''Lectures'']] with the [[atomic theory|atomic hypothesis]], as his most compact statement of all scientific knowledge: "If, in some cataclysm, all of scientific knowledge were to be destroyed, and only one sentence passed on to the next generations ..., what statement would contain the most information in the fewest words? I believe it is ... that ''all things are made up of atoms – little particles that move around in perpetual motion, attracting each other when they are a little distance apart, but repelling upon being squeezed into one another. ...''" {{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note: The term 'universe' is defined as everything that physically exists: the entirety of space and time, all forms of matter, energy and momentum, and the physical laws and constants that govern them. However, the term 'universe' may also be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting concepts such as the [[cosmos]] or the [[world (philosophy)|philosophical world]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Physics is one of the oldest [[academic discipline]]s, perhaps the oldest through its inclusion of [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Evidence exists that the earliest civilizations dating back to beyond 3000&amp;nbsp;BCE, such as the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Ancient Egyptians]], and the [[Indus Valley Civilization]], all had a predictive knowledge and a very basic understanding of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the last two millennia, physics was a part of [[natural philosophy]] along with [[chemistry]], certain branches of [[mathematics]], and [[biology]], but during the [[Scientific Revolution]] in the 16th century, the [[natural science]]s emerged as unique research programs in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon]]'s 1620 ''[[Novum Organum]]'' was critical in the [[History of scientific method|development of scientific method]].&lt;/ref&gt; Certain research areas are [[interdisciplinary]], such as [[biophysics]] and [[quantum chemistry]], which means that the boundaries of physics are not [[demarcation problem|rigidly defined]]. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries [[physicalism]] emerged as a major unifying feature of the [[philosophy of science]] as physics provides fundamental explanations for every [[observation|observed]] natural [[phenomenon]]. New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms of other sciences, while opening to new research areas in mathematics and philosophy.

==== Chemistry ====
{{Main article|Chemistry|Outline of chemistry}}

''Chemistry'' (the etymology of the word has been much disputed)&lt;ref&gt;'''See:''' [[Chemistry (etymology)]] for possible origins of this word.&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[science]] of [[matter]] and the changes it undergoes. The science of matter is also addressed by [[physics]], but while physics takes a more general and fundamental approach, chemistry is more specialized, being concerned by the composition, behavior (or reaction), structure, and properties of [[matter]], as well as the changes it undergoes during [[chemical reaction]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Chemistry Chemistry]. (n.d.). Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved August 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[physical science]] which studies various [[chemical substance|substance]]s, [[atom]]s, [[molecule]]s, and matter (especially carbon based); [[biochemistry]], the study of [[chemical substance|substances]] found in [[organisms|biological organisms]]; [[physical chemistry]], the study of chemical processes using physical concepts such as [[thermodynamics]] and [[quantum mechanics]]; and [[analytical chemistry]], the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their [[chemical composition]] and [[Chemical structure|structure]]. Many more specialized disciplines have emerged in recent years, e.g. [[neurochemistry]] the chemical study of the [[nervous system]] (see [[#Subdisciplines|subdisciplines]]).

''Earth science'' (also known as ''geoscience'', ''the geosciences'' or ''the Earth sciences'') is an all-embracing term for the [[science]]s related to the [[planet]] [[Earth (planet)|Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=Earth+science&amp;sub=Search+WordNet&amp;o2=&amp;o0=1&amp;o7=&amp;o5=&amp;o1=1&amp;o6=&amp;o4=&amp;o3=&amp;h=0 Wordnet Search: Earth science]&lt;/ref&gt; It is arguably a special case in [[planetary science]], the Earth being the only known [[life]]-bearing planet. There are both [[reductionist]] and [[holism|holistic]] approaches to Earth sciences. The formal discipline of Earth sciences may include the study of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, oceans and biosphere, as well as the solid earth. Typically Earth scientists will use tools from [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geography]], [[chronology]] and [[mathematics]] to build a quantitative understanding of how the Earth system works, and how it evolved to its current state.

===== Ecology=====
{{Main article|Ecology|Outline of ecology}}

Ecology (from Greek: οἶκος, "house"; -λογία, "study of") is the [[scientific]] study of the relationships that living [[organisms]] have with each other and with their abiotic [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Topics of interest to ecologists include the composition, distribution, amount ([[biomass]]), number, and changing states of organisms within and among [[ecosystems]].

===== Oceanography =====
{{Main article|Oceanography}}

Oceanography, or marine biology, is the branch of [[Earth science]] that study of the ocean . It covers a wide range of topics, including [[marine organisms]] and [[ecosystem]] dynamics; [[ocean currents]], [[water waves|waves]], and geophysical fluid dynamics; [[plate tectonics]] and the geology of the sea floor; and [[flux|fluxes]] of various chemical substances and physical properties within the ocean and across its boundaries. These diverse topics reflect multiple disciplines that oceanographers blend to further knowledge of the world ocean and understanding of processes within it: [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[meteorology]], and [[physics]] as well as [[geography]].

===== Geology =====
{{Main article|Geology|Outline of geology}}

Geology (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] γῆ, gê, "earth" and λόγος, [[logos]], "study") is the science comprising the study of solid [[Earth]], the [[rocks]] of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change.

===== Meteorology=====
{{Main article|Meteorology|Outline of meteorology}}

Meteorology is the [[interdisciplinary]] scientific study of the [[atmosphere]]. Studies in the field stretch back millennia, though significant progress in meteorology did not occur until the 17th century. The 19th century saw breakthroughs occur after observing networks developed across several countries. After the development of the computer in the latter half of the 20th century, breakthroughs in [[weather forecasting]] were achieved.

==== Space Science or Astronomy ====
{{Main article|Space Science|Outline of space science}}

Space science or Astronomy is the study of everything in outer space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/space+science space science – definition of space science by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This has sometimes been called [[astronomy]], but recently astronomy has come to be regarded as a division of broader space science, which has grown to include other related fields,&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/planetary-science/planetary-science-data/national-space-science-data-center-nssdc/ National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) – NASA Science&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; such as studying issues related to [[Spaceflight|space travel]] and [[space exploration]] (including [[space medicine]]), [[space archaeology]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/space+science Space science | Define Space science at Dictionary.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and science performed in [[outer space]] (see [[space research]]).

=== Life science ===
{{Main article|Life science|Outline of life sciences}}

''Life science'' comprises the branches of science&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemirror.com/branches-of-science-the-complete-list Branches of Science]&lt;/ref&gt; that involve the scientific study of living organisms, like plants, animals, and human beings. However, the study of behavior of organisms, such as practiced in ethology and psychology, is only included in as much as it involves a clearly biological aspect. While biology remains the centerpiece of life science, technological advances in molecular biology and biotechnology have led to a burgeoning of specializations and new, often interdisciplinary, fields.

==== Biology ====
{{Main article|Biology|Outline of biology}}

''Biology'' is the branch of [[natural science]] concerned with the study of [[life]] and living [[organism]]s, including their structure, function, growth, origin, evolution, distribution, and taxonomy.&lt;ref&gt;Based on definition from [http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html Aquarena Wetlands Project glossary of terms.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040608000000/http://www.bio.txstate.edu/~wetlands/Glossary/glossary.html |date=June 8, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Biology is a vast subject containing many subdivisions, topics, and disciplines.

===== Zoology =====
{{Main article|Zoology|Outline of zoology}} 

Zoology, occasionally spelled zoölogy, is the branch of science that relates to the animal kingdom, including the structure, embryology, evolution, classification, habits, and distribution of all animals, both living and extinct. The term is derived from Ancient Greek ζῷον (zōon, "animal") + λόγος (logos, "knowledge"). Some branches of zoology include: [[anthrozoology]], [[arachnology]], [[archaeozoology]], [[cetology]], [[embryology]], [[entomology]], [[helminthology]], [[herpetology]], [[histology]], [[ichthyology]], [[malacology]], [[mammalogy]], [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[nematology]], [[ornithology]], [[palaeozoology]], [[pathology]], [[primatology]], [[protozoology]], [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and [[zoogeography]].

=====Human biology=====
{{main article|Human biology}}
Human biology is an interdisciplinary academic field of biology, biological anthropology, nutrition and medicine which focuses on humans; it is closely related to primate biology, and a number of other fields.

Some branches of biology include: [[microbiology]], [[anatomy]], [[neurology]] and [[neuroscience]], [[immunology]], [[genetics]], [[physiology]], [[pathology]], [[biophysics]], [[biolinguistics]], and [[ophthalmology]].

===== Botany=====
{{Main article|Botany|Outline of botany}}

Botany, plant science, or plant biology is a branch of biology that involves the scientific study of plant life. Botany covers a wide range of scientific disciplines including structure, growth, reproduction, metabolism, development, diseases, chemical properties, and evolutionary relationships among taxonomic groups. Botany began with early human efforts to identify edible, medicinal and poisonous plants, making it one of the oldest sciences. Today botanists study over 550,000 species of living organisms.
The term "botany" comes from Greek βοτάνη, meaning "pasture, grass, fodder", perhaps via the idea of a livestock keeper needing to know which plants are safe for livestock to eat.

== Social sciences ==
{{Main article|Social sciences|Outline of social science}}

The ''social sciences'' are the [[field of study|fields]] of [[Scholarly method|scholarship]] that study society. "Social science" is commonly used as an [[umbrella term]] to refer to a plurality of fields outside of the [[natural sciences]]. These include: [[anthropology]], [[archaeology]], [[business administration]], [[communication]], [[criminology]], [[economics]], [[education]], [[government]], [[linguistics]], [[international relations]], [[political science]], some branches of [[psychology]] (results of which can not be replicated or validated easily - e.g. [[social psychology]]), [[public health]], [[ theology]], [[sociology]] and, in some contexts, [[geography]], [[history]] and [[law]].&lt;ref name="issues"&gt;{{cite book |last=Verheggen |year=1999 |chapter=From shared representations to consensually coordinated actions |title=Theoretical Issues in Psychology |editor-first=John |editor-last=Morrs |publisher=International Society for Theoretical Psychology |location= |isbn= |display-authors=etal|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.staff.u-szeged.hu/~garai/Vygotskyboom.htm |first=L. |last=Garai |first2=M. |last2=Kocski |title=Another crisis in the psychology: A possible motive for the Vygotsky-boom |journal=Journal of Russian and East-European Psychology |year=1995 |volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=82–94 |doi=10.2753/RPO1061-0405330182 |pmid= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Formal sciences ==
{{Main article|Formal sciences|Outline of formal science}}

The ''formal sciences'' are the branches of science that are concerned with [[formal system]]s, such as [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[theoretical computer science]], [[information theory]], [[systems theory]], [[decision theory]], [[statistics]], and [[theoretical linguistics]].

Unlike other sciences, the formal sciences are not concerned with the validity of [[Scientific theory|theories]] based on [[observation]]s in the [[Reality|real world]] ([[empirical knowledge]]), but rather with the properties of [[formal system]]s based on [[definition]]s and [[Rule of inference|rule]]s. Methods of the formal sciences are, however, essential to the construction and testing of [[scientific model]]s dealing with observable reality,{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=79&amp;ndash;82}} and major advances in formal sciences have often enabled major advances in the empirical sciences.

=== Decision theory ===
{{Main article|Decision theory}}

''Decision theory'' in economics, psychology, philosophy, mathematics, and statistics is concerned with identifying the values, uncertainties and other issues relevant in a given decision, its rationality, and the resulting optimal decision. It is very closely related to the field of game law.

=== Logic ===
{{Main article|Logic|Outline of logic}}

''Logic'' (from the Greek ''[[wiktionary:λογική|λογική]]'' logikē)&lt;ref&gt;"possessed of reason, intellectual, dialectical, argumentative", also related to ''[[wiktionary:λόγος|λόγος]]'' (logos), "word, thought, idea, argument, account, reason, or principle" (Liddell &amp; Scott 1999; Online Etymology Dictionary 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; is the formal systematic study of the [[principle]]s of valid [[inference]] and correct [[reasoning]]. Logic is used in most intellectual activities, but is studied primarily in the disciplines of [[philosophy]], [[mathematics]], [[semantics]], and [[computer science]].  Logic examines general forms which [[argument]]s may take, which forms are valid, and which are [[fallacies]]. In philosophy, the study of logic figures in most major areas: [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[metaphysics]]. In mathematics and computer science, it is the study of valid [[inference]]s within some [[formal language]].&lt;ref name=stanford-logic-onthology&gt;{{cite book | last = Hofweber | first = T. | year = 2004 | chapter = Logic and Ontology |  title = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | editor-first = Edward N | editor-last = Zalta | editor-link = Edward N. Zalta | chapterurl = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ontology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Logic is also studied in [[argumentation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first = J. Robert | editor1-last = Cox | editor2-first = Charles Arthur | editor2-last = Willard | editor2-link = Charles Arthur Willard | title = Advances in Argumentation Theory and Research | publisher = [[Southern Illinois University Press]] | year = 1983 | isbn = 978-0-8093-1050-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematics ===
{{Main article|Mathematics|Outline of mathematics}}

''Mathematics'', first of all known as The Science of numbers which is classified in Arithmetic and Algebra, is classified as a formal science,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item1173067/?site_locale=en_GB Marcus Tomalin (2006) ''Linguistics and the Formal Sciences'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Benedikt Löwe]] (2002) [https://www.jstor.org/pss/20117289 "The Formal Sciences: Their Scope, Their Foundations, and Their Unity"]&lt;/ref&gt; has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] rather than empirical methods.{{sfn|Popper|2002|pp=10&amp;ndash;11}}

=== Statistics ===
{{Main article|Statistics|Outline of statistics}}

''Statistics'' is the study of the collection, organization, and interpretation of [[data]].&lt;ref name=Dodge&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dict.asp?Word=statistics The Free Online Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; It deals with all aspects of this, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of [[Statistical survey|surveys]] and [[experimental design|experiments]].&lt;ref name=Dodge/&gt;

A [[statistician]] is someone who is particularly well versed in the ways of thinking necessary for the successful application of statistical analysis. Such people have often gained this experience through working in any of a [[list of fields of application of statistics|wide number of fields]]. There is also a discipline called ''[[mathematical statistics]]'', which is concerned with the theoretical basis of the subject.

The word ''statistics'', when referring to the scientific discipline, is singular, as in "Statistics is an art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/statistics | title = Statistics | work = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; This should not be confused with the word ''statistic'', referring to a quantity (such as [[mean]] or [[median]]) calculated from a set of data,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/statistic | title = Statistic | work = Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose plural is ''statistics'' ("this statistic seems wrong" or "these statistics are misleading").

=== Systems theory ===
{{Main article|Systems theory}}

''Systems theory'' is the [[Interdisciplinary|interdisciplinary]] study of [[system]]s in general, with the goal of elucidating principles that can be applied to all types of systems in all fields of research. The term does not yet have a well-established, precise meaning, but systems theory can reasonably be considered a specialization of [[systems thinking]] and a generalization of [[systems science]]. The term originates from [[Ludwig con Albertan|Bernays]]'s [[#General systems research and systems inquiry|General System Theory]] (GS) and is used in later efforts in other fields, such as the [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] of [[Alcott Parsons]] and the system-theory of [[Nickolas McLuhan]].

In this context the word ''systems'' is used to refer specifically to self-regulating systems, i.e. that are self-correcting through [[feedback]]. Self-regulating systems are found in nature, including the physiological systems of our body, in local and global ecosystems, and in climate.

=== Theoretical computer science ===
{{Main article|Theoretical computer science}}

''Theoretical computer science'' (TCS) is a division or subset of general [[computer science]] and focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing.

These divisions and subsets include [[analysis of algorithms]] and [[formal semantics of programming languages]]. Technically, there are hundreds of divisions and subsets besides these two. Each of the multiple parts have their own individual personal leaders (of popularity) and there are many associations and professional social groups and publications of distinction.

== Applied sciences==
{{Main article|Applied science|Outline of applied sciences}}

''Applied science'' is the application of scientific knowledge transferred into a physical environment. Examples include testing a theoretical model through the use of formal science or solving a practical problem through the use of natural science.

Applied science differs from [[fundamental science]], which seeks to describe the most basic objects and forces, having less emphasis on practical applications. Applied science can be like biological science and physical science.

Example fields of applied science include
* [[Engineering]]
* [[Applied mathematics]]
* [[Applied physics]]
* [[Medicine]]
* [[Computer science]]

Fields of [[engineering]] are closely related to applied sciences. Applied science is important for [[technology]] development. Its use in industrial settings is usually referred to as [[research and development]] (R&amp;D).

'''Brescia University College''' is a [[Catholic higher education|Catholic]] [[Liberal arts college|liberal arts]] [[women's college]] located in [[London, Ontario|London]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].  Affiliated with the [[University of Western Ontario]], Brescia is the only [[university]]-level women's college in Canada. It has approximately 1,100 [[undergraduate]] students. According to the 2017 Ranking Web of Universities, Brescia was ranked 150 in a list of post-secondary institutions in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.webometrics.info/en/North_america/Canada?page=1|title=Canada {{!}} Ranking Web of Universities|website=www.webometrics.info|access-date=2017-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Brescia is an officially Catholic institution,&lt;ref name="Leishman2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rory Leishman|title=Against Judicial Activism: The Decline of Freedom and Democracy in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9aoPksJ0dj4C&amp;pg=PA60|year=2006|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-6001-7|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; it accepts students of all faiths and backgrounds.

==History==
Brescia was founded in 1919 as '''Ursuline College''' by the [[Ursulines]], an organization of women of Catholic faith.&lt;ref name="Fay2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Terence J. Fay|title=History of Canadian Catholics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vwNvfUGvRqsC&amp;pg=PA119|date=9 May 2002|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP|isbn=978-0-7735-6988-1|page=119}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berger2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Teresa Berger|title=Dissident Daughters: Feminist Liturgies in Global Context|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u37ZRKrTj3kC&amp;pg=PA106|date=1 January 2001|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|isbn=978-0-664-22379-3|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally located in an old converted house at 556 Wellington Street in downtown [[London, Ontario]].&lt;ref name="LutmanGallery1978"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John H.

''The Canadian Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the graduates received University of Western Ontario degrees.&lt;ref name="BoutilierPrentice2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Beverly Boutilier|author2=Alison Prentice|title=Creating Historical Memory: English-Canadian Women and the Work of History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ryT0gX7czfUC&amp;pg=PA307|date=1 November 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-4164-1|page=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ursuline Sisters named the [[Roman Catholic]] college after the [[Italy|Italian]] city of [[Brescia]] where their [[religious institute]] was founded. The first class was of seven young women who each paid $50 for tuition.

The Ursuline Superior General, Mother Clare Gaukler, bought a piece of land at 1285 Western Road in London, and construction began on a permanent building in 1923.  The building was built by contractor Joseph Michael Piggot, opened for classes and residence in 1925, and was named Brescia Hall.  Brescia Hall was later renamed "Ursuline Hall".

Brescia was known as a liberal arts school and the courses taught were: English, French, Spanish, Philosophy, History, Classics, and Religious Knowledge. Brescia students took other courses such as Science, Mathematics, Political Economy at [[University of Western Ontario|Western]]. Over time, Brescia adapted some of the courses (e.g., Philosophy) to be appropriate for Catholic women. In 1936, a Home Economics program was begun, it evolved into what is known today as the Department of Food and Nutritional Sciences.

Ursuline College was renamed "Brescia College" in 1963, and in 2001 renamed "Brescia University College".

In September 2007, Brescia started the first graduate program.  In 2017, the college began offering a degree in non-profit management.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/business-education/new-degree-breaks-ground-for-non-profit-sector/article25402352/ "New degree breaks ground for non-profit sector"].  Jennifer Lewington, ''The Globe and Mail'', July 10, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

*Bachelor of Arts (English, French, Psychology, Sociology, Family Studies, Philosophy and Religious Studies, Community Development, Political Science, Human Ecology and Dimensions of Leadership)
*Bachelor of Management &amp; Organizational Studies
*Bachelor of Science (Foods &amp; Nutrition and Human Ecology)
*Master of Foods and Nutritional Sciences
*Certificate in Community Development
*Certificate in Religious Education

The Honours Bachelor of Science in Foods and Nutrition at Brescia is accredited by [[Dietitians of Canada]], making graduates eligible to apply for dietetic internship placements.

Brescia offers a Master of Foods and Nutritional Sciences program, which is divided into two streams: The internship MSc stream, available to those who have graduated from a programme accredited by Dietitians of Canada, combines a master's degree with an internship and graduates can write the exam needed to become a registered dietitian.  The second stream is for people who are already a Registered Dietitian in Canada.

Brescia also offers a Preliminary Year, a co-educational one-year university preparatory program taught by university professors on the College campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brescia.uwo.ca/future/pre-university/index.html Preliminary Year] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515005324/http://www.brescia.uwo.ca/future/pre-university/index.html |date=May 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The College also offers an English as a Second Language programme called  CultureWorks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lfpress.com/2016/08/02/assyrian-brother-and-sister-fled-syria-and-got-scholarships-to-londons-western-university/wcm/2f1f8455-6330-1690-df73-10beb37986a0 "Assyrian brother and sister fled Syria and got scholarships to London's Western University"]. ''London Free Press'', By Dale Carruther, August 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==
The Preliminary Year programme and the Masters of Science are co-education; all undergraduate programs are women-only. However, all courses are accessible to UWO students, male or female, including students from Western's two other affiliated university colleges.

==Buildings==
James Carlisle Pennington designed Brescia Hall (1924–25) for the Ursuline Sisters, near Western Road at Sarnia Road, on the campus of the University of Western Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1385 James Carlisle Pennington&lt;/ref&gt; The Mother St. James memorial building (completed in 1963) is the main building on campus; it houses classrooms, offices, student services, the business office, the Beryl Ivey Library and computer lab, the Mother St. James Memorial Auditorium, a coffee shop and the Circle Women's Centre resource centre. The Ursuline hall is the residence for 170 female students.  Ursuline Hall also has the cafeteria (Castle Café), some professors' offices, the food laboratories and a few classrooms. In September 2013, Brescia opened its new residence building and dining pavilion, Clare Hall, which houses just over 300 students and includes an eatery called the Mercato.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brescia.uwo.ca/campus_life/residence/overview.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928112843/http://www.brescia.uwo.ca/campus_life/residence/overview.html |archivedate=2013-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''challenge''' can serve as a dare or an exhortation, motivating a person or persons by "[a]n invitation or summons to a trial or contest of any kind" and thus to "a difficult or demanding task, esp[ecially] one seen as a test of one's abilities or character".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite OED | challenge}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, speakers or writers can use challenges to [[motivation | motivate]] - to convince people "to perform an action they otherwise [might] not".&lt;ref&gt; 
Compare https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/challenge
&lt;/ref&gt;
A challenge can thus become a [[Rhetorical device | tool]] of [[rhetoric]]: a '''rhetorical challenge'''.&lt;ref&gt;

Through this device, the speaker could shift from describing issues into a mode of exhortation, epitomized by the repetition of 'I challenge' twenty-five times, and its context-specific entailments - for example, 'I urge,' 'I invite,' and so on.

''Not to be confused with [[computer engineering]].''

'''Computational science and engineering''' (CSE) is a relatively new discipline that deals with the development and application of computational models and simulations, often coupled with [[high-performance computing]], to solve complex physical problems arising in engineering analysis and design (computational engineering) as well as natural phenomena ([[computational science]]). CSE has been described as the "third mode of discovery" (next to theory and experimentation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.cseprograms.gatech.edu/sites/default/files/CSEHandbook-Students-v11.pdf |title=Computational Science and Engineering Program: Graduate Student Handbook | website=cseprograms.gatech.edu |date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many fields, computer simulation is integral and therefore essential to business and research. Computer simulation provides the capability to enter fields that are either inaccessible to traditional experimentation or where carrying out traditional empirical inquiries is prohibitively expensive. CSE should neither be confused with pure [[computer science]], nor with [[computer engineering]], although a wide domain in the former is used in CSE (e.g., certain algorithms, data structures, parallel programming, high performance computing) and some problems in the latter can be modeled and solved with CSE methods (as an application area).

It is typically offered as a [[Master of Science|masters]] or [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] program at several institutions.

==Methods==
Computational Science and Engineering methods and frameworks include:
* [[High performance computing]] and techniques to gain efficiency (through change in computer architecture, parallel algorithms etc.)
* [[Computer model|Modeling]] and [[simulation]]
* [[Algorithms]] for solving discrete and continuous problems
* Analysis and visualization of data
* Mathematical foundations: Numerical and applied linear algebra, initial &amp; boundary value problems, Fourier analysis, optimization
* [[Data_science|Data Science]] for developing methods and algorithms to handle and  extract  knowledge from large scientific data
With regard to computing, computer programming, algorithms, and parallel computing play a major role in CSE. The most widely used programming language in the scientific community is [[FORTRAN]]. Recently, [[C++]] and C have increased in popularity over FORTRAN. Due to the wealth of legacy code in FORTRAN and its simpler syntax, the scientific computing community has been slow in completely adopting C++ as the lingua franca. Because of its very natural way of expressing mathematical computations, and its built-in visualization capacities, the proprietary language/environment [[MATLAB]] is also widely used, especially for rapid application development and model verification. [[Python (programming language)|Python]] along with external libraries (such as [[NumPy]], [[SciPy]], [[Matplotlib]]) has gain some popularity as a free and [[Copycenter]] alternative to MATLAB.
==Applications==
[[File:Elmer-pump-heatequation.png|thumb|right|A numerical solution to the [[heat equation]] on a pump casing [[Mathematical model|model]] using the [[finite element method]].]]
Computational Science and Engineering finds diverse applications, including in:
*  [[Aerospace Engineering]] and [[Mechanical Engineering]]: [[Combustion models for CFD|combustion simulations]], [[structural dynamics]], [[computational fluid dynamics]], [[computational thermodynamics]], computational solid mechanics, vehicle crash simulation, biomechanics, trajectory calculation of satellites
* Astrophysical systems

* [[Biology]] and [[Medicine]]: protein folding simulations (and other macromolecules), bioinformatics, genomics, computational neurological modeling, modeling of biological systems (e.g., ecological systems), 3D CT ultrasound, MRI imaging, molecular bionetworks, cancer and seizure control
* [[Chemistry]]: calculating the structures and properties of chemical compounds/molecules and solids, computational chemistry/cheminformatics, molecular mechanics simulations, computational chemical methods in solid state physics, chemical pollution transport
* [[Civil Engineering]]: [[finite element analysis]], structures with random loads, construction engineering, water supply systems, transportation/vehicle modeling
* [[Computer Engineering]], [[Electrical Engineering]], and [[Telecommunications]]: VLSI, computational electromagnetics, semiconductor modeling, simulation of microelectronics, energy infrastructure, RF simulation, networks
* [[Epidemiology]]: influenza spread
* [[Environmental Engineering]] and [[Numerical weather prediction]]: [[climate research]], [[Computational geophysics]] (seismic processing), modeling of natural disasters
* [[Finance]]: derivative pricing, risk management
* [[Industrial Engineering]]: discrete event and Monte-Carlo simulations (for logistics and manufacturing systems for example), queueing networks, [[mathematical optimization]]
* [[Material Science]]: glass manufacturing, polymers, and crystals
* [[Nuclear Engineering]]: nuclear reactor modeling, radiation shielding simulations, fusion simulations
* [[Petroleum engineering]]: petroleum reservoir modeling, oil and gas exploration

'''Computational particle physics''' refers to the methods and computing tools developed in and used by  [[particle physics]] research. Like [[computational chemistry]] or [[computational biology]], it is, for [[particle physics]] both a specific branch and an interdisciplinary field relying on computer science, theoretical and experimental particle physics and mathematics.
The main fields of computational particle physics are: [[lattice field theory]] (numerical computations), [[automatic calculation of particle interaction or decay]] (computer algebra) and [[event generator]]s (stochastic methods).

==Computing tools==
* [[Computer algebra]]: Many of the computer algebra languages were developed initially to help particle physics calculations: [[Reduce (computer algebra system)|Reduce]], [[Mathematica]], [[Schoonschip]], [[Form (computer algebra system)|Form]], [[GiNaC]].&lt;ref&gt;''Stefan Weinzierl:- [http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/582375/files/0209234.ps.gz "Computer Algebra in Particle Physics."]  pgs 5-7. Accessed 1 January 2012; (alternative link) : [https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ph/0209234v1.pdf "Computer Algebra in Particle Physics ."]  [[arXiv]]:hep-ph/0209234. Accessed 1 January 2012. "Seminario Nazionale di Fisica Teorica", Parma, September 2002.''&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://eu-datagrid.web.cern.ch/eu-datagrid/ Data Grid]: The largest planned use of the [[Grid computing|grid systems]] will be for the analysis of the [[LHC]] - produced data. Large software packages have been developed to support this application like the [[LHC Computing Grid|LHC Computing Grid (LCG)]] . A similar effort in the wider [[e-Science]] community is the [[GridPP]] collaboration, a consortium of particle physicists from UK institutions and CERN.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.gridpp.ac.uk/ GridPP website] '' : accessed 19 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Data_analysis#Nuclear_and_particle_physics|Data Analysis Tools]]:  These tools are motivated by the fact that particle physics experiments and simulations often create large datasets, e.g. see references.&lt;ref&gt;'' Dirk Duellmann, ''  [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/availability/s291499-2-duellmann-134596.pdf/ "Oracle Streams for the Large Hadron Collider"] '', page 3.

Accessed 20 February 2012.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
''David Rousseau, "The Software behind the Higgs Boson Discovery," IEEE Software, pp. 11-15, Sept.-Oct., 2012''
&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include [[ROOT]], [[Java Analysis Studio]] and [[SCaViS]].
* Software Libraries: Many [[software libraries]] are used for particle physics computations. Examples include [[FreeHEP]], [[CLHEP]]. Also important are packages that simulate particle physics interactions using [[Monte Carlo simulation]] techniques (i.e. event generators). Prominent examples of these include [[PYTHIA]], [[Geant4]] and its Fortran predecessor, [[GEANT (program)|GEANT]].

==History==

Particle physics played a role in the early history of the internet, the [[World-Wide Web]] was created by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] when working at CERN in 1991.

=== Computer Algebra ===
Note: This section contains an excerpt from 'Computer Algebra in Particle Physics' by Stefan Weinzierl

Particle physics is an important field of application for computer algebra and exploits the capabilities of Computer Algebra Systems (CAS). This leads to valuable feed-back for the development of CAS. Looking at the history of [[computer algebra systems]], the first programs date back to the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;''Stefan Weinzierl, [[Computational particle physics#cite note-1|op. cit.]] :  pgs 3-5.''&lt;/ref&gt; The first systems were almost entirely based on [[LISP| LISP ("LISt Programming language")]]. LISP is an [[interpreted language]] and, as the name already indicates, designed for the manipulation of [[List (abstract data type)|lists]]. Its importance for [[symbolic computing|symbolic computer programs]] in the early days has been compared to the importance of FORTRAN for numerical programs in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;''Stefan Weinzierl, [[Computational particle physics#cite note-1|op. cit.]] :  pgs 3-5.''&lt;/ref&gt; Already in this first period, the program [[REDUCE]] had some special features for the application to high energy physics. An exception to the LISP-based programs was [[SCHOONSHIP]], written in [[assembler language]] by [[Martinus J. G. Veltman]] and specially designed for applications in particle physics. The use of assembler code lead to an incredible fast program (compared to the interpreted programs at that time) and allowed the calculation of more complex [[scattering]] processes in high energy physics. It has been claimed the program's importance was recognized in 1998 by awarding the half of the Nobel prize to Veltman.&lt;ref&gt;''Stefan Weinzierl, [[Computational particle physics#cite note-1|op. cit.]] :  pgs 3-5.''&lt;/ref&gt; Also the program [[MACSYMA]]  deserves to be mentioned explicitly, since it triggered important development with regard to algorithms. In the 1980s new computer algebra systems started to be written in [[C (programming language)|C]]. This enabled the better exploitation of the [[computer memory|resources]] of the computer (compared to the interpreted language LISP) and at the same time allowed to maintain [[Software portability|portability]] (which would not have been possible in assembler language). This period marked also the appearance of the first commercial computer algebra system, among which Mathematica and [[Maple (software)|Maple]]  are the best known examples. In addition, also a few dedicated programs appeared, an example relevant to particle physics is the program FORM by J. Vermaseren as a (portable) successor to SCHOONSHIP. More recently issues of the [[software maintenance|maintainability]] of large projects became more and more important and the overall [[programming paradigm]]a changed from [[procedural programming]] to [[object-oriented]] design. In terms of programming languages this was reflected by a move from C to [[C++]]. Following this change of paradigma, the library GiNaC was developed. The GiNac library allows symbolic calculations in C++. 

[[Automatic_programming#Implementations|Code generation for computer algebra]] can also be used in this area.

=== Lattice field theory ===

[[Lattice field theory]] was created by [[Kenneth G. Wilson|Kenneth Wilson]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;'' Kenneth G. Wilson, Confinement of quarks, Physical Review D, 10, 1974, p. 2445–59 ''&lt;/ref&gt; Simulation techniques were later developed from statistical mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;'' David J. E. Callaway and Aneesur Rahman (1982). "Microcanonical Ensemble Formulation of Lattice Gauge Theory". Physical Review Letters 49 (9): 613–616. Bibcode 1982PhRvL..49..613C. doi:10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.613.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'' David J. E. Callaway and Aneesur Rahman (1983). "Lattice gauge theory in the microcanonical ensemble". Physical Review D28 (6): 1506–1514. Bibcode 1983PhRvD..28.1506C. doi:10.1103/PhysRevD.28.1506. ''&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the early 1980s, LQCD researchers have pioneered the use of [[massively parallel]] computers in large scientific applications, using virtually all available computing systems including traditional main-frames, large [[computer cluster|PC clusters]], and high-performance systems. In addition, it has also been used as a [[Benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] for [[high-performance computing]], starting with the IBM [[Blue Gene]] supercomputer.

Eventually national and regional QCD grids were created: LATFOR (continental Europe), UKQCD and USQCD. The ILDG (International Lattice Data Grid) is an international venture comprising grids from the UK, the US, Australia, Japan and Germany, and was formed in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;'' C.M.

The '''Cool Climate [[Oenology]] and [[Viticulture]] Institute''' (CCOVI) is a [[research institute]] at [[Brock University]] in [[St. Catharines]], [[Ontario]], Canada. It was established in 1996 and is a partnership with the Wine Council of Ontario (WCO) and the Ontario Grape Growers Marketing Board, now the Grape Growers of Ontario (GGO).  In addition to its research programs, it offers  academic programs  through the Department of Biological Sciences. CCOVI has had several graduates complete the undergraduate, graduate, and certificate programs, and announced their first PhD graduate in 2007.

Graduates from CCOVI have established careers in winegrowing regions around the globe including France, New Zealand, Australia, and California. Many graduates have chosen to help further establish and improve the Canadian wine industry in the [[Niagara Peninsula]], [[British Columbia]], [[Lake Erie]] North Shore region, [[Prince Edward County, Ontario|Prince Edward County]], and [[Nova Scotia]]. CCOVI graduates have had great success in many fields including winemaking, viticulture, research and development, and academia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6660">'''Dispositif''' is a term used by the French intellectual [[Michel Foucault]], generally to refer to the various institutional, physical, and administrative mechanisms and knowledge structures which enhance and maintain the exercise of [[Power (philosophy)|power]] within the social body.

==Translation==
Dispositif is translated variously, even in the same book, as 'device', 'machinery', 'apparatus', 'construction', and 'deployment'.

== Definition ==

Foucault uses the term in his 1977 "The Confession of the Flesh" interview, where he answers the question, "What is the meaning or methodological function for you of this term, [[Apparatus theory|apparatus]] (dispositif)?" as follows:

:''"What I'm trying to pick out with this term is, firstly, a thoroughly heterogeneous ensemble consisting of discourses, institutions, architectural forms, regulatory decisions, laws, administrative measures, scientific statements, philosophical, moral and philanthropic propositions–in short, the said as much as the unsaid. Such are the elements of the apparatus. The apparatus itself is the system of relations that can be established between these elements."''&lt;ref&gt;"The Confession of the Flesh" (1977) interview. In Power/Knowledge Selected Interviews and Other Writings (ed Colin Gordon), 1980: pp. 194–228.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://foucaultblog.wordpress.com/2007/04/01/what-is-the-dispositif "What is the ''dispositive''?"] Foucault Blog, April 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German linguist [[Siegfried Jäger]] defines Foucault's ''dispositif'' as

:''"the interaction of discursive behavior (i. e. speech and thoughts based upon a shared knowledge pool), non-discursive behavior (i. e. acts based upon knowledge), and manifestations of knowledge by means of acts or behaviors ''...''. ''Dispositifs'' can thus be imagined as a kind of ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'', the complexly interwoven and integrated ''dispositifs'' add up in their entirety to a ''dispositif'' of all society."''&lt;ref&gt;''"das Zusammenspiel diskursiver Praxen (= Sprechen und Denken auf der Grundlage von Wissen), nichtdiskursiver Praxen (= Handeln auf der Grundlage von Wissen) und „Sichtbarkeiten“ bzw. „Vergegenständlichungen“ (von Wissen durch Handeln/Tätigkeit) ''...''. Dispositive kann man sich insofern auch als eine Art „Gesamtkunstwerke“ vorstellen, die – vielfältig  miteinander verzahnt und verwoben – ein gesamtgesellschaftliches Dispositiv ausmachen."'', [http://www.diss-duisburg.de/Internetbibliothek/Artikel/Aspekte_einer_Kritischen_Diskursanalyse.htm Siegfried Jäger: Theoretische und methodische Aspekte einer Kritischen Diskurs- und Dispositivanalyse]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish philosopher Raffnsøe "advances the 'dispositive' (le dispositif) as a key conception in Foucault's work" and "a resourceful approach to the study of contemporary societal problems."&lt;ref&gt;What is a dispositive? Foucault's historical mappings of the networks of social reality" https://www.academia.edu/9838825/What_is_a_dispositive_Foucault_s_historical_mappings_of_the_networks_of_social_reality&lt;/ref&gt; According to Raffnsøe, "the dispositionally prescriptive level is a crucial aspect of social reality in organizational life, since it has a determining effect on what is taken for granted and considered real. Furthermore, it determines not only what is and can be considered possible but also what can even be imagined and anticipated as potentially realizable, as something one can hope for, or act to bring about".&lt;ref&gt;Foucault's dispositive: The perspicacity of dispositive analytics in organizational Research": 21

=== Agamben's delineation ===
The Italian political philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] traces the trajectory of the term to [[Aristotle]]'s ''oikonomia—the effective management of the household''  and the early Church Fathers' attempt to save the concept of the Trinity from the allegation of polytheism, as the triplicity of the God is his oikonomia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=jDGrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=dispositif+agamben+dictionary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=98j4y5vhL5&amp;sig=QBqpf3kZtb92q246YMByRdoidmE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwieqfWgz_7PAhUIL48KHYe9DoIQ6AEIHTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=dispositif%20agamben%20dictionary&amp;f=false|title=Agamben Dictionary|last=Murray|first=Alex|date=2011-06-06|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9780748646982|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Agamben defines the ''apparatus''/''dispositif'' as

:''"Further expanding the already large class of Foucauldian apparatuses, I shall call an apparatus literally anything that has in some way the capacity to capture, orient, determine, intercept, model, control, or secure the gestures, behaviors, opinions, or discourses of living beings. Not only, therefore, prisons, madhouses, the panopticon, schools, confession, factories, disciplines, judicial measures, and so forth (whose connection with power is in a certain sense evident), but also the pen, writing, literature, philosophy, agriculture, cigarettes, navigation, computers, cellular telephones and—why not—language itself, which is perhaps the most ancient of apparatuses—one in which thousands and thousands of years ago a primate inadvertently let himself be captured, probably without realizing the consequences that he was about to face."''&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio Agamben, "What is an Apparatus?" in ''What is an Apparatus? And Other Essays''. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2009: p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian scholar Matteo Pasquinelli criticises Agamben's genealogy with these words

:''"The dispositif is traced back, theoretically and philologically, to the definition of social normativity that Foucault takes from Canguilhem's The Normal and the Pathological (1966) and to the use of the term dispositif by Canguilhem himself in the essay "Machine and Organism" (1952). Both these lineages proceed from the notion of organic normativity that Canguilhem adopts from the German-Jewish neurologist Kurt Goldstein, that is from a tradition of Lebensphilosophie that appears to be incompatible with Agamben's theological thesis."''&lt;ref&gt;Matteo Pasquinelli, "What an Apparatus is Not: On the Archeology of the Norm in Foucault, Canguilhem, and Goldstein". Parrhesia 22,  2015, 79-89. [http://matteopasquinelli.com/what-an-apparatus-is-not/ PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ukrainian SSR===

[[Drohobych]] Petroleum and Gas College was founded as [[Drohobych]] Petroleum Technical College on January 20, 1945 (Decree №58 of the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian Government]]). Since its establishment the school trained over 20 thousand specialists in oil, gas and their refining industry.

The first graduation ceremony was held in 1948.

Given the increasing demand for industry specialists by [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] region companies, college opened a branch department in [[Boryslav]] in, 1953.  Evening courses were dedicated to specialists training in the fields of "Exploitation of oil and gas wells" and "The technology of oil and gas".

In 1957 Drohobych Petroleum Technical College was merged with [[Lviv]] College of Petroleum Refining.

In 1958 college established distance-learning department, conducting training of specialists in the fields of "Drilling oil and gas wells", "Exploitation of oil and gas wells", "Equipment of oil and gas industries" and "Chemical technology of oil and gas".

In 1959 a new branch (evening school) was opened in [[Dolyna]] with following desiplines offered: "Exploitation of oil and gas wells", "Equipment oil and gas industry" and "Oil and gas industry enterprises planning".

Due to the decrease in the number of applicants for evening departments, [[Boryslav]] and [[Dolyna]] branches ceased operations in 1973 and 1975 respectively.

===Post-Declaration===

In 1997 Petroleum Technical College received a license qualifying it for training junior specialists in the field of "Banking" and "Gas and oil exploitation and storage management".

Currently, the college prepares specialists in nearly all specialties related to oil and gas extraction and processing.

In December 2006, the [[Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine]] (Decree №64) accredited Petroleum Technical College as a higher educational institution of the first level and issued its first certificate of accreditation (license serial no. AB482982) granting college the right to provide educational services related to obtaining higher education level qualification "junior specialist".

In August 2012 college was renamed to "State Higher Educational Institution "[[Drohobych]] Petroleum and Gas College" (Decree №870 of the [[Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine|Ministry of Education of Ukraine]]).

==College today==

College training is based on primary and secondary education on a full-time, part-time and distance learning basis. Total student population: 1600.

'''Elephant hunting''' or '''elephant [[poaching]]''' and exploitation of the [[ivory trade]] are illegal in [[Chad]] and pose a major threat to elephant populations. The profitable [[ivory]] industry is also a threat to the lives of rangers, even in the national parks, such as [[Zakouma National Park]], the worst-affected area.

==History==
Elephants are often massacred in herds in and around the parks by organized poachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.co.uk/news/2006/08/060830-elephants-chad.html|title=African Elephants Slaughtered in Herds Near Chad Wildlife Park|first=Brian|last=Handwerk|work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date=30 August 2006|accessdate=17 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017173341/http://news.nationalgeographic.co.uk/news/2006/08/060830-elephants-chad.html|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem is worsened by the fact that the parks are understaffed and that a number of wardens have been murdered by poachers.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/world/africa/central-africas-wildlife-rangers-face-deadly-risks.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1382003098-yauBx4MSdHcb4DxeUgSrUw|title=Rangers in Isolated Central Africa Uncover Grim Cost of Protecting Wildlife|first=Jeffrey|last=Gettleman|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=31 December 2012|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, since the mid-1980s the elephant population has declined from 150,000 to a reported figure of just 2,000 in the Chad-[[Cameroon]] region by one source&lt;Ref name=Guard&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/mar/19/86-elephants-chad-poaching-massacre|title= 86 elephants killed in Chad poaching massacre|first=Celeste|last=Hicks|date=19 March 2013|accessdate=18 October 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 500 in Chad alone in 2013 according to another source&lt;ref name = IvoryCurse&gt;Vera, Varun and Ewing, Thomas (April 2014) [http://www.bornfreeusa.org/downloads/pdf/Ivorys-Curse-2014.pdf Ivory's Curse] Born Free USA and C4ADS, Retrieved 16 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; because of intense poaching. American journalist [[Lisa Ling]] has visited Chad to explore the country's elephant poaching problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nocostl.com/2012/03/journalist-lisa-ling-speaking-the-touhill/ |title=Renowned journalist Lisa Ling speaking @ UMSL |first=Shannon |last=Howard |date=3 March 2012 |publisher=NOCO ~ The online magazine of North St. Louis County |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194325/https://nocostl.com/2012/03/journalist-lisa-ling-speaking-the-touhill/ |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a July 2012 attack by mounted poachers near the SOS Elephants camp in the [[Chari-Baguirmi Region]], 28 elephants were slaughtered and most of their tusks were removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enn.com/wildlife/article/44721/print|title=Dozens of elephants massacred in Chad|first=Laurel |last=Neme|publisher=Environmental News Network|date=27 July 2012|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another attack in September 2012, about {{convert|50|mi}} from the boundaries of the Zakouma National Park, five rangers were killed; one is still missing and presumed dead. The [[Sudanese Armed Forces|Sudanese military]] have been blamed for the attacks and the slaughtering of elephants not only in Zakouma and elsewhere in Chad, but also in other African nations, including Cameroon.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; As of 2012, a small team was responsible for battling to protect the remaining 450 elephants in Zakouma. One of the worst massacres took place in 14–15 March 2013 when 89 elephants, including 33 pregnant females and 15 calves, were slaughtered by poachers near the town of [[Gamba, Chad|Gamba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldwildlife.org/press-releases/poachers-kill-at-least-89-elephants-in-chad|title=Poachers Kill at Least 89 Elephants in Chad|publisher=[[World Wildlife Fund]]|date=19 March 2013|accessdate=17 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation efforts==
Stephanie Vergniault, a French lawyer, screenwriter, and conservationist who has been working in Chad since 2009, founded the SOS Elephants organization to protect the elephant population. In an interview in 2010, Vergniault stated that the population of elephants in Chad had declined by 85 percent in the previous three decades, and that if the same rate of poaching continues, "not a single elephant" would be alive in Chad within three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.mongabay.com/2010/0512-hance_chad.html#Ll676J36vAfPYtVV.99|title=A nation of tragedies: the unseen elephant wars of Chad |first=Jeremy |last=Hance|date=12 May 2010|accessdate=18 October 2013|publisher= Mongabay.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Friedrich A. Kittler''' (June 12, 1943 &amp;ndash; October 18, 2011) was a literary scholar and a media theorist. His works relate to [[Mass media|media]], [[technology]], and the [[military]].

==Biography==
Friedrich Adolf Kittler was born in 1943 in [[Rochlitz]] in [[Saxony]]. His family fled with him to [[West Germany]] in 1958, where from 1958 to 1963 he went to a [[natural sciences]] and [[modern languages]] ''[[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'' in [[Lahr]] in the [[Black Forest]], and thereafter, until 1972, he studied [[German studies]], [[Romance languages|Romance]] [[philology]] and [[philosophy]] at the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg]] in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]. During his studies, he was especially influenced by the writings of [[Jacques Lacan]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Martin Heidegger]].

In 1976, Kittler received his doctorate in philosophy after a thesis on the poet [[Conrad Ferdinand Meyer]]. Between 1976 and 1986 he worked as academic assistant at the university's ''Deutsches Seminar''. In 1984, he earned his [[Habilitation]] in the field of Modern German Literary History.

He had several stints as a Visiting Assistant Professor or Visiting Professor at universities in the [[United States]], such as the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] and [[Stanford University]].

From 1986 to 1990, he headed the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft|DFG's]] ''Literature and Media Analysis'' project in [[Kassel]] and in 1987 he was appointed Professor of Modern German Studies at the [[Ruhr University]]. In 1993 he was appointed to the chair for Media Aesthetics and History at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]].

In 1993, Kittler was awarded the "Siemens Media Arts Prize" (''Siemens-Medienkunstpreis'') by [[Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie|ZKM Karlsruhe]] (''Zentrum für Kunst und Medientechnologie'', or "Centre for Art and Media Technology") for his research in the field of media theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://on1.zkm.de/zkm/stories/storyReader%241107 Siemens Medienkunstpreis 1993/ Friedrich Kittle] ZKM. Museum für Neue Kunst.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was recognized in 1996 as a Distinguished Scholar at [[Yale University]] and in 1997 as a Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City|New York]]. Kittler was a member of the Hermann von Helmholtz Centre for Culture and the research group ''Bild Schrift Zahl'' ("Picture Writing Number") (DFG).  

Among Kittler's theses was his tendency to argue, with a mixture of polemicism, apocalypticism, erudition, and humor, that technological conditions were closely bound up with epistemology and ontology itself. This claim and his style of argumention is aptly summed up in his dictum "Nur was schaltbar ist, ist überhaupt"—a phrase that could be translated as "Only that which is switchable, exists" or more freely, "Only that which can be switched, can be." This phrase plays both on the concept that in principle any representation can be presented according to the on/off binary logic of computing. Kittler goes one step further by suggesting that, conversely, anything that can't be "switched" can't really "be," at least under current technical conditions. He invoked this doctrine on his deathbed in 2011. Dying in a hospital in Berlin and sustained only by a medical instruments, his final words were "Alle Apparate ausschalten", which translates as "switch off all apparatuses".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/2011/11/09/tom-mccarthy/kittler-and-the-sirens/ London Review of Books article].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Friedrich Kittler is influential in the new approach to [[media influence|media theory]] that grew popular starting in the 1980s, [[new media]] ({{lang-de|technische Medien}}, which translates roughly to "technical media"). Kittler's central project is to "prove to the human sciences [...] their technological-media ''a priori''" ([[Hartmut Winkler]]), or in his own words: "Driving the human out of the humanities",&lt;ref&gt;This loses something in the translation, since "spirit" is "Geist" in [[German language|German]], and "[[humanities]]" is "Geisteswissenschaften", or "spiritual sciences".&lt;/ref&gt; a title that he gave a work that he published in 1980.

Kittler sees an autonomy in technology and therefore disagrees with [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s reading of the media as "extensions of man": "Media are not pseudopods for extending the human body. They follow the logic of escalation that leaves us and written history behind it. (Kittler in ''Geschichte der Kommunikationsmedien''. In: Jörg Huber, Alois Martin Müller (publishers): ''Raum und Verfahren''.)

Consequently, he sees in writing literature, in writing programmes and in burning structures into [[silicon chip]]s a complete continuum: "As we know and simply do not say, no human being writes anymore. [...] Today, human writing runs through inscriptions burnt into silicon by electronic lithography [...]. The last historic act of writing may thus have been in the late seventies when a team of Intel engineers [plotted] the hardware architecture of their first integrated microprocessor." (Kittler, ''Es gibt keine Software''. In: ders.: ''Draculas Vermächtnis. Technische Schriften''.)

{{cquote|And Kittler is a good friend of mine – I sponsored a chair at the Humboldt University for two years. He is not mainstream. Historians of music come and say, “But he did not write his thesis on [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina|Palestrina]].” And all the professors of philosophy say, “But did he write a thesis on [[Kant]] or Heidegger?” No, Kittler is a mixture: Kittler is in between philosophy, the history of music, computer science, and media theory. That’s why he is completely outstanding. We have some fundamental heroes in Germany, really outstanding people on the level of [[Deleuze]], [[Derrida]], Lacan, [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]] … Among these are [[Bazon Brock]], Friedrich Kittler, [[Peter Sloterdijk|Sloterdijk]], [[Horst Bredekamp|Bredekamp]], or [[Hans Belting]]. These people will last longer than I will in this book. In 50 years, each of them will be known as people who had been very sensitive to changes of the media.—[[Hubert Burda]], 2011&lt;ref&gt;[[David Woodard|Woodard, D.]], "In Media Res," ''[[032c]]'', Sum 2011, [http://032c.com/2012/in-media-res/ pp. 180–189].&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|180–189}}}}

In [[gender studies]], '''hegemonic masculinity''' is part of [[Raewyn Connell|R.&amp;nbsp;W. Connell]]'s gender order theory, which recognizes multiple [[masculinities]] that vary across time, culture and the individual. Hegemonic masculinity is defined as a practice that legitimizes men's dominant position in society and justifies the subordination of women, and other marginalized ways of being a man.&lt;ref name=Con2005/&gt; Conceptually, hegemonic masculinity proposes to explain how and why men maintain dominant social roles over women, and other gender identities, which are perceived as "feminine" in a given society.

As a [[sociology|sociologic]] concept, the nature of hegemonic masculinity derives from the theory of [[cultural hegemony]], by Marxist theorist [[Antonio Gramsci]], which analyses the [[Power (social and political)|power relations]] among the [[social classes]] of a society. Hence, in the term ''hegemonic masculinity'', the adjective ''hegemonic'' refers to the cultural dynamics by means of which a social group claims, and sustains, a leading and dominant position in a social hierarchy; nonetheless, hegemonic masculinity embodies a form of social organization that has been sociologically challenged and changed.

The conceptual beginnings of hegemonic masculinity represented the culturally idealized form of manhood that was socially and hierarchically exclusive and concerned with bread-winning; that was anxiety-provoking and differentiated (internally and hierarchically); that was brutal and violent, pseudo-natural and tough, [[Cognitive dissonance|psychologically contradictory]], and thus crisis-prone; economically rich and socially sustained.&lt;ref name=Don1993&gt;{{cite journal |last= Donaldson | first = Mike | title = What is hegemonic masculinity? | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 22 | issue = 5 | pages = 643&amp;ndash;657 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/BF00993540 | jstor = 657988 | date = October 1993 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00993540 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many sociologists criticized that definition of ''hegemonic masculinity'' as a fixed character-type, which is analytically limited, because it excludes the complexity of different, and competing, forms of masculinity. Consequently, hegemonic masculinity was reformulated to include gender [[hierarchy]], the geography of masculine configurations, the processes of social embodiment, and the psycho-social dynamics of the varieties of masculinity. Moreover, proponents argue that hegemonic masculinity is conceptually useful for understanding gender relations, and is applicable to life-span development, [[education]], [[criminology]], the representations of masculinity in the mass communications media, the health of men and women, and the functional [[Organizational structure|structure of organizations]].&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Pattern of Hegemonic Masculinity.jpg|thumb|The cyclical pattern of how hegemonic masculinity is produced, reproduced, and perpetuated]]
Terry Kupers of [[The Wright Institute]] describes the concept of hegemonic masculinity in these terms: {{quote|In contemporary American and European culture, [hegemonic masculinity] serves as the standard upon which the "real man" is defined. According to [R.&amp;nbsp;W.] Connell, contemporary hegemonic masculinity is built on two legs, domination of women and a hierarchy of intermale dominance. It is also shaped to a significant extent by the stigmatization of homosexuality. Hegemonic masculinity is the stereotypic notion of masculinity that shapes the socialization and aspirations of young males. Today’s hegemonic masculinity in the United States of America and Europe includes a high degree of ruthless competition, an inability to express emotions other than anger, an unwillingness to admit weakness or dependency, devaluation of women and all feminine attributes in men, homophobia, and so forth.&lt;ref name="Kupers 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Kupers | first = Terry A. | title = Toxic masculinity as a barrier to mental health treatment in prison | journal = [[Journal of Clinical Psychology]] | volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pages = 713&amp;ndash;724 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1002/jclp.20105 | date = June 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jclp.20105 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

===History===
The concept of hegemonic masculinity was first proposed in field reports from a study of [[social inequality]] in Australian high schools;&lt;ref name=Kessler1982&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Connell | first1 = R.&amp;nbsp;W. | last2 = Kessler | first2 = Sandra J. | last3 = Ashenden | first3 = Dean | last4 = Dowsett | first4 = Gary | author-link1 = Raewyn Connell | title = Ockers &amp; disco-maniacs: a discussion of sex, gender and secondary schooling | publisher = Inner City Education Centre | location = Stanmore, New South Wales | year = 1982 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 9780908274246 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in a related conceptual discussion of the making of masculinities and the experiences of men's bodies;&lt;ref name=Con1983&gt;{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&amp;nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Which way is up? Essays on sex, class, and culture | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin | location = Sydney Boston | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780868613741 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a debate over the role of men in Australian labour politics.&lt;ref name=Con1982&gt;{{cite journal | last = Connell | first = R.&amp;nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Class, patriarchy, and Sartre's theory of practice | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = 305&amp;ndash;320 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/BF00211660 | jstor = 657273 | date = May 1982 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00211660 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; These beginnings were organized into an article&lt;ref name=Carrigan1985&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carrigan | first1 = Tim | last2 = Connell | first2 = R.&amp;nbsp;W. | last3 = Lee | first3 = John | author-link2 = Raewyn Connell | title = Toward a new sociology of masculinity | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 14 | issue = 5 | pages = 551&amp;ndash;604 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/BF00160017 | jstor = 657315 | date = September 1985 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00160017 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; which critiqued the "[[gender role|male sex role]]" literature and proposed a model of multiple masculinities and power relations. This model was integrated into a systematic sociological theory of gender. The resulting six pages in ''Gender and Power'' by [[Raewyn Connell|R.&amp;nbsp;W. Connell]]&lt;ref name=Con1987&gt;{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&amp;nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Gender and power: society, the person and sexual politics | publisher = Allen &amp; Unwin | location = Sydney Boston | year = 1987 | isbn = 9780041500868 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on "hegemonic masculinity and emphasized femininity" became the most cited source for the concept of hegemonic masculinity.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Connell | first1 = R.&amp;nbsp;W. | last2 = Messerschmidt | first2 = James W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Hegemonic masculinity: rethinking the concept | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 19 | issue = 6 | pages = 829&amp;ndash;859 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0891243205278639 | date = December 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0891243205278639 | ref = harv}} [http://xyonline.net/sites/default/files/Connell,%20Hegemonic%20masculinity_0.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; This concept draws its theoretical roots from the [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramscian]] term ''[[cultural hegemony|hegemony]]'' as it was used to understand the stabilization of class relations. The idea was then transferred to the problem of gender relations.

Hegemonic masculinity draws some of its historical roots from both the fields of social psychology and sociology which contributed to the literature about the male sex role that had begun to recognize the social nature of masculinity and the possibilities of change in men's conduct.&lt;ref name=Hack1957&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hacker | first = Helen Mayer | title = The new burdens of masculinity | journal = [[Journal of Marriage and Family|Marriage and Family Living]] | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 227&amp;ndash;233 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.2307/348873 | jstor = 348873 | date = August 1957 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; This literature preceded the [[Feminist movement|Women's Liberation Movement]] and [[feminist theory|feminist theories]] of [[patriarchy]] which also played a strong role in shaping the concept of hegemonic masculinity. The core concepts of power and difference were found in the [[gay liberation]] movement which had not only sought to analyse the oppression of men but also oppression by men.&lt;ref name=Alt1972&gt;{{cite book | last = Altman | first = Dennis | title = Homosexual: oppression and liberation | publisher = Angus and Robertson | location = Sydney, Australia | year = 1972 | isbn = 9780207124594 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea of a hierarchy of masculinities has since persisted and strongly influenced the reformulation of the concept.

Empirical social research also played an important role as a growing body of field studies documented local gender hierarchies and local cultures of masculinities in schools,&lt;ref name=Willis1977&gt;{{cite book | last = Willis | first = Paul | author-link = Paul Willis | title = [[Learning to Labour|Learning to Labor: How Working Class Kids Get Working Class Jobs]] | publisher = Saxon House | location = Farnborough, England | year = 1977 |oclc = 692250005}}&lt;/ref&gt; male-dominated workplaces,&lt;ref name=Cockburn1983&gt;{{cite book | last = Cockburn | first = Cynthia | title = Brothers: male dominance and technological change | publisher = Pluto Press | location = London | year = 1983 | isbn = 9780861043842 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and village communities.&lt;ref name=Herdt1981&gt;{{cite book | last = Herdt | first = Gilbert | title = Guardians of the flutes: idioms of masculinity | publisher = McGraw-Hill | location = New York | year = 1981 | isbn = 9780070283152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the concept was influenced by [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] produced the first analytic biographies of men and showed how adult personality was a system under tension and the psychoanalyst Robert J. Stoller&lt;ref name=Stoller1968&gt;{{cite book | last = Stoller | first = Robert J. | title = Sex and gender: the development of masculinity and femininity | publisher = Karnac Books | location = London | year = 1984 |origyear = 1968 | isbn = 9780946439034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; popularized the concept of [[gender identity]] and mapped its variation in boys' development.

===Original framework===

The particular normative form of masculinity that is the most honoured way of being a man, which requires all other men to position themselves in relation to it, is known as hegemonic masculinity.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; Originally, hegemonic masculinity was understood as the pattern of practice that allowed men's dominance over women to continue. In Western society, the dominant form of masculinity or the cultural ideal of manhood was primarily reflective of white, heterosexual, largely middle-class males. The ideals of manhood espoused by the dominant masculinity suggested a number of characteristics that men are encouraged to internalize into their own personal codes and which form the basis for masculine scripts of behaviour. These characteristics include: [[violence]] and [[aggression]], [[stoicism]] (emotional restraint), [[courage]], toughness, physical strength, athleticism, [[risk]]-taking, [[adventure]] and [[wikt:thrill|thrill]]-seeking, [[competition|competitiveness]], and achievement and [[Social status|success]].&lt;ref name=Don1993/&gt; Hegemonic masculinity is not completely dominant, however, as it only exists in relation to non-hegemonic, subordinated forms of masculinity.&lt;ref name="Con1987" /&gt; The most salient example of this approach in contemporary European and American society is the dominance of heterosexual men and the subordination of homosexual men. This was manifested in political and cultural exclusion, legal violence, street violence, and economic discrimination.&lt;ref name=Con2005&gt;{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&amp;nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Masculinities | edition = 2nd | location = Berkeley, California | publisher = University of California Press | year = 2005 | isbn=9780745634265 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W8h1h8wa2yQC  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gay masculinity was the most conspicuous subordinated masculinity during this period of time, but not the only one. Heterosexual men and boys with effeminate characteristics ran the risk of being scorned as well.

Hegemonic masculinity is neither normative in the numerical sense, as only a small minority of men may enact it, nor in an actual sense, as the cultural ideal of masculinity is often a fantasy figure, such as [[John Wayne]] or [[John Rambo]].&lt;ref name="Con1987" /&gt; Hegemonic masculinity may not even be the commonest pattern in the everyday lives of men. Rather, hegemony can operate through the formation of exemplars of masculinity, symbols that have cultural authority despite the fact that most men and boys cannot fully live up them.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; Hegemonic masculinity imposes an ideal set of traits which stipulate that a man can never be unfeminine enough. Thus, fully achieving hegemonic masculinity becomes an unattainable ideal.

Complicity to the aforementioned masculine characteristics was another key feature of the original framework of hegemonic masculinity. Yet still since men benefit from the patriarchal dividend, they generally gain from the overall subordination of women. However, complicity is not so easily defined as pure subordination since marriage, fatherhood, and community life often involve extensive compromises with women rather than simple domination over them. In this way hegemony is not gained through necessarily violent or forceful means, but it is achieved through culture, institutions, and persuasions.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt;

The interplay of gender with class and race creates more extensive relationships among masculinities. For example, new information technology has redefined middle-class masculinities and working-class masculinities in different ways. In a racial context, hegemonic masculinity among whites sustains the institutional oppression and physical terror that have framed the making of masculinities in black communities.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; It has been suggested that historically suppressed groups like inner city African-American males exhibit the more violent standards of hegemonic masculinity in response to their own subordination and lack of control.&lt;ref name=Con2005/&gt; This idea of [[marginalization]] is always relative to what is allowed by the dominant group, therefore creating subsets of hegemonic masculinity based on existing social hierarchies.

==Criticisms==

As the earliest model of this concept grew, so did the scrutiny and criticisms surrounding it. The following principal criticisms have been identified since debate about the concept began in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt;

===Underlying concept of masculinity===

The underlying concept of masculinity has been argued as flawed from both a [[literary realism|realist]] and a [[post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] point of view. To Hearn,&lt;ref name=Hearn&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hearn | first = Jeff | title = From hegemonic masculinity to the hegemony of men | journal = [[Feminist Theory (journal)|Feminist Theory]] | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 49&amp;ndash;72 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1464700104040813 | date = April 2004 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1464700104040813 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of masculinity is blurred, uncertain in its meaning, and tends to deemphasize issues of power and domination. To Petersen,&lt;ref name=Petersen&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Petersen | first = Alan | title = Research on men and masculinities: Some implications of recent theory for future work | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 54&amp;ndash;69 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1097184X02250843 | date = July 2003 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1097184X02250843 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; the concept of masculinity is flawed because it reduces the character of men or imposes a false unity of a fluid and contradictory reality. The concept of masculinity is criticized for being framed within a [[heteronormative]] conception of gender that oversimplified male-female difference and ignores differences and exclusions within the gender categories. The concept of masculinity is said to rest logically on a dichotomization of sex (biological) and gender (cultural) and thus marginalizes or naturalizes the body. Brod&lt;ref name=Brod&gt;{{cite book  | last = Brod | first = Harry | author-link = Harry Brod |chapter = Some thoughts on some histories of some masculinities: Jews and other others |chapterurl=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=gXk5DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82| editor-last1 = Brod | editor-first1 = Harry | editor-last2 = Kaufman | editor-first2 = Michael | editor-link1 = Harry Brod | editor-link2 =  Michael Kaufman (author) | title = Theorizing masculinities | pages = 82&amp;ndash;96 | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780803949041 }}&lt;/ref&gt; observes that there is a tendency in men's studies field to proceed as if women were not a relevant part of the analysis and therefore to analyse masculinities by looking only at men and relations among men. Therefore, a consistently relational approach to gender is being called upon.

===Ambiguity and overlap===

Early criticisms of the concept raised the question of who actually represents hegemonic masculinity.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; Many men who hold great social power do not embody an ideal masculinity. Martin&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Martin | first = Patricia Yancey | title = Why can't a man be more like a woman? Reflections on Connell's ''Masculinities'' | journal = [[Gender &amp; Society]] | volume = 12 | issue = 4 | pages = 472&amp;ndash;474 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/089124398012004008 | date = August 1998 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/089124398012004008 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticizes the concept for leading to inconsistent applications sometimes referring to a fixed type and other times to whatever the dominant form is. Wetherell and Edley&lt;ref name=Weth&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wetherell | first1 = Margaret | last2 = Edley | first2 = Nigel | title = Negotiating hegemonic masculinity: Imaginary positions and psycho-discursive practices | journal = [[Feminism &amp; Psychology]] | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 335&amp;ndash;356 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0959353599009003012 | date = August 1999 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959353599009003012 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; contend this concept fails to specify what conformity to hegemonic masculinity actually looks like in practice. Similarly Whitehead&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite book | last = Whitehead | first = Stephen M. | title = Men and masculinities: key themes and new directions | publisher = Polity Press | location = Cambridge Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745624679 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests there is confusion over who actually is a hegemonically masculine man. Inspired by Gramsci's differentiation between hegemony as a form of ideological consent and dominance as an expression of conflict Groes-Green&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Groes-Green | first = Christian | title = Hegemonic and subordinated masculinities: Class, violence and sexual performance among young Mozambican men | journal = Nordic Journal of African Studies | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 286&amp;ndash;304 | publisher = Nordic Association of African Studies | date = 2009 | url = http://www.njas.helsinki.fi/abstracts/vol18num4/abstract_18_4_2.html | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; has argued that when hegemonic masculinities are challenged in a society dominant masculinities are emerging based on bodily powers, such as violence and sexuality, rather than based on economic and social powers. Through examples from his fieldwork among youth in Maputo, Mozambique he shows that this change is related to social polarization, new class identities and the undermining of breadwinner roles and ideologies in a neoliberal economy.

===The problem of realness===

It has also been argued that the concept of hegemonic masculinity does not adequately describe a realness of power. Holter&lt;ref name=Holter&gt;{{cite book | last = Holter | first = Øystein Gullvåg | title = Can men do it? Men and gender equality: the Nordic experience | publisher = Nordic Council of Ministers | location = Copenhagen | year = 2003 | isbn = 9789289308458 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that the concept constructs power from the direct experience of women rather than from the structural basis of women's subordination. Holter believes in distinguishing between [[patriarchy]] and [[gender]] and argues further that it is a mistake to treat a hierarchy of masculinities constructed within gender relations as logically continuous with the patriarchal subordination of women. In response to the adverse connotations surrounding the concept, Collier&lt;ref name=Collier&gt;{{cite book | last = Collier | first = Richard | title = Masculinities, crime, and criminology: men, heterosexuality, and the criminal(ised) other | publisher = Sage Publications | location = London Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1998 | isbn = 9780803979970 }}&lt;/ref&gt; remarks that hegemonic masculinity is solely associated with negative characteristics that depict men as unemotional, aggressive, independent, and non-nurturing without recognizing positive behaviours such as bringing home a wage or being a father.

===The masculine subject===

Several authors have argued that the concept of hegemonic masculinity is based on an unsatisfactory theory of the subject because it does not rely enough upon discourses of masculinity.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; Wetherell and Edley argue that hegemonic masculinity cannot be understood as the characteristics that constitute any group of men.&lt;ref name=Weth/&gt; To Whitehead the concept fails to specify how and why some heterosexual men legitimate, reproduce, and generate their dominance and do so as a social minority since they are outnumbered by women and other men they dominate.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; A related criticism also derives from psychoanalysis which has criticized the lack of attention given to how men actually psychologically relate to hegemonic masculinity. For example, Laurie argues that the hegemonic masculinity framework lends itself to a modified essentialism, wherein the "achievement of masculine goals is frequently attributed to a way of thinking understood as inherent to the male psyche, and in relation to an innate disposition for homosocial bonding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Laurie|first=Timothy | title = Masculinity studies and the jargon of strategy: ''hegemony, tautology, sense'' | journal = [[Angelaki|Angelaki: Journal of the Theoretical Humanities]], special issue: Geophilosophies of masculinity: remapping gender, aesthetics and knowledge | volume = 20 | issue = 1 | pages = 13&amp;ndash;30 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | date = 2015 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/0969725X.2015.1017373 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.academia.edu/10912537/Masculinity_Studies_and_the_Jargon_of_Strategy_Hegemony_Tautology_Sense Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The pattern of gender relations===

There is considerable evidence that hegemonic masculinity is not a self-reproducing form. Demetriou suggests this is because a kind of simplification has occurred.&lt;ref name=Deme&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Demetriou | first = Demetrakis Z. | title = Connell's concept of hegemonic masculinity: A critique | journal = [[Theory and Society]] | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 337&amp;ndash;361 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1023/A:1017596718715 | jstor = 657965 | date = June 2001 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A%3A1017596718715 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; He identifies two forms of hegemony, internal and external. External hegemony relates to the institutionalization of men's dominance over women and internal hegemony refers to the position of one group of men over all other men. Scholars commonly do not clarify or acknowledge the relationship between the two. This suggests that subordinated and marginalized masculinities do not impact the construction of hegemonic masculinity as much as critics suggest it should.

==Reformulation==

In one of the most widely cited works analysing the concept, Connell and Messerschmidt sought to reformulate their theory of hegemonic masculinity in light of certain criticisms.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; They readjusted their framework to address four main areas: the nature of gender hierarchy, the geography of masculine configurations, the process of social embodiment, and the dynamics of masculinities.

===Gender hierarchy===
{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}

Gender hierarchy seeks to explain not only why men hold a superior position to women but how each group influences one another. Research has documented the durability of nonhegemonic patterns of masculinity, which may represent well-crafted responses to racial/ethnic marginalization, physical disability, class inequality, or stigmatized sexuality. Hegemony may be accomplished by the incorporation of such masculinities into functioning gender order rather than by active oppression in the form of degradation or violence.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; An example would include that of the mainstream adoption of black hip hop culture which was created in response to urban structural inequalities. Another example is that of "protest masculinity", in which local working-class settings, sometimes involving ethnically marginalized men, embodies the claim to power typical of regional hegemonic masculinities in Western countries, but lack the economic resources and institutional authority that underpins the regional and global patterns.

This new emphasis on gender hierarchy seeks to take a more relational approach to women as well. Women are central in many of the processes constructing masculinities, as mothers, schoolmates, girlfriends, sexual partners, wives, and workers in the gender division of labour. Gender hierarchies are affected by new configurations of women's identity and practice so more attention has been given to the historical interplay of femininities and masculinities.

===Geography of masculinities===

Change in locally specific constructions of hegemonic masculinity has been a consistent theme of masculinity research, but given the growing attention to globalization, the significance of transnational arenas for the construction of masculinity has also been argued. Hooper described the deployment of masculinities in the arenas of [[international relations]],&lt;ref name=Hoop&gt;{{cite book | last = Hooper | first = Charlotte | title = Manly states : masculinities, international relations, and gender politics | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780231120753 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Connell proposed a model of "transnational business masculinity" among jet-setting corporate executives.&lt;ref name=Con2005/&gt; Because of this, Connell and Messerschmidt have proposed hegemonic masculinities be analysed at three levels: local, regional, and global.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; The links between these levels are critical to gender politics since interventions at any level giving women more power and representation can influence from the top down or from the bottom up. Additionally, adopting a framework that distinguishes between the three levels allows one to recognize the importance of place without making generalizations about independent cultures or discourses.

===Social embodiment===

Social embodiment calls for a more rigid definition of what a hegemonically masculine man is and how the idea is actually carried out in real life. The pattern of embodiment involved in hegemony has been recognized in the earliest formulations of the concept but called for more theoretical attention. The importance of masculine embodiment for identity and behaviour emerges in many contexts. For example, in youth, skill in physical activity becomes a prime indicator of masculinity. This notion continues to manifest itself into many different health and sexual practices such as eating meat or having multiple sexual partners. The emergence of transgender issues has made it particularly clear that embodiment be given more focus in reconceptualizations.&lt;ref name=Rubin&gt;{{cite book | last = Rubin | first = Henry | title = Self-made men: identity and embodiment among transsexual men | publisher = Vanderbilt University Press | location = Nashville, Tennessee | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780826514349 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circuits of social embodiment may be very direct and simple or may be long and complex, passing through institutions, economic relations, cultural symbols, and so forth without ceasing to involve material bodies.&lt;ref name=Con2002&gt;{{cite book | last = Connell | first = R.&amp;nbsp;W. | author-link = Raewyn Connell | title = Gender | publisher = Polity Blackwell Publishers | location = Cambridge, England | year = 2002 | isbn = 9780745627168 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamics of masculinities===

New theory has recognized the layering and potential internal contradictions within all practices that construct masculinities. This is a departure from a unitary masculinity and focus on compromised formations between contradictory desires or emotions. Masculinities are configurations of practice that are constructed, unfold, and change through time.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; One area of focus may represent that of Western fathers given the gender division of labour in child care, the "long hours culture" of professions and management, and the preoccupation of rich fathers with managing their wealth.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; While these practices may adhere to conventional Western ideas of hegemonic masculinity, this may not necessarily translate into a satisfying life experience. As gender relations evolve and women's movements grow stronger, the dynamics of masculinities may see a complete abolition of power differentials and a more equitable relationship between men and women and between men and other men.&lt;ref name=Deme/&gt; This positive hegemony remains a key strategy for contemporary efforts at reforming gender relations.&lt;ref name=Collier/&gt; Groes-Green has argued that Connell's theory of masculinities risks excluding the possibility of more gender equitable or "philogynous" forms of masculinity such as those he has identified in Mozambique. He urges social researchers to begin developing theories and concepts that can improve an understanding of how more positive, alternative and less dominant masculinities may develop even if these are always embedded in local gender power relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Groes-Green | first = Christian | title = Philogynous masculinities: contextualizing alternative manhood in Mozambique | journal = [[Men and Masculinities]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 91&amp;ndash;111 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/1097184X11427021 | date = June 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1097184X11427021 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifespan development==

===Early childhood===
Children learn at an early age, mostly through educational and peer interactions, what it means to be a boy and what it means to be a girl, and are quick to demonstrate that they understand these roles.&lt;ref name="Laemmle, J. 2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Laemmle | first = Julie | title = Barbara Martin: ''Children at Play: Learning Gender in the Early Years'' (book review) | journal = [[Journal of Youth and Adolescence]] | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 305&amp;ndash;307 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | doi = 10.1007/s10964-012-9871-7 | date = February 2013 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10964-012-9871-7 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}
*''Review of'': {{cite book | last = Martin | first = Barbara | title = Children at play: learning gender in the early years | publisher = Trentham Books | location = Stoke-on-Trent Sterling, Virginia | year = 2011 | isbn = 9781858564845 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This notion of "doing" gender involves differentiating between boys and girls from the day they are born and perpetuating the discourses of gender difference.&lt;ref name="Bhana, D. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bhana | first = Deevia | title = "Boys will be boys": what do early childhood teachers have to do with it? | journal = Educational Review | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 327&amp;ndash;339 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/00131910903045963 | date = 2009 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00131910903045963 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of dualism of the genders are misconstrued by [[dominant ideology]] and feeds into social norms of masculinity. Children learn and show development of gender identity as an ongoing process, based on social situations. Gendered toys can play a large role in demonstrating the preferred actions and behaviour of young boys in [[early childhood]]. The male role is also reinforced by observing older boys and reactions of authority figures, including parents.  The promotion of idealized masculine roles emphasizing toughness, dominance, self-reliance, and the restriction of emotion can begin as early as infancy. Such norms are transmitted by parents, other male relatives, and members of the community.{{refn|name=Levant 1996}}{{refn|name=Weir}} Media representations of masculinity on websites such as [[YouTube]] often promote similar stereotypical gender roles.{{refn|name=Weir}}

Although gender socialization is well underway before children reach preschool, stereotypical differences between boys and girls are typically reinforced, rather than diminished, by their early educational childhood experiences.&lt;ref name="Gelb, S. 1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gelb | first = Steven A. | title = Language and the problem of male salience in early childhood classroom environments | journal = [[Early Childhood Research Quarterly]] | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 205&amp;ndash;215 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/S0885-2006(89)80003-1 | date = June 1989 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0885-2006(89)80003-1 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers have a large role in reinforcing gender stereotypes by limiting children's choices at this young age, thus not allowing boys to explore their feelings or their understandings about gender freely. This is done through the endorsement of hegemonic masculinity embodying physical domination, strength, competitiveness, sport, courage, and aggression.&lt;ref name="Bhana, D. 2009"/&gt; These gendered performances are based on society's construction of femininity and masculinity in relation to heterosexuality. [[Heteronormativity]] is the standard for children; despite their obvious sexual innocence, heterosexuality is ingrained in children in their acting of gender from an early age.&lt;ref name="Laemmle, J. 2013"/&gt;

Another factor that contributes to gendered behaviour and roles is the greater visibility, importance, and presence of males than females in literature, and in the language that teachers use for communication and instruction. Male-generic pronouns are a special problem in early childhood settings.&lt;ref name="Gelb, S. 1989"/&gt; A recommended method to help gender barriers disappear is specific training for teachers and more education on the topic for parents. Though, an ultimate conclusion by one author notes that young children know, feel, and think gender despite the wishes of adults to make gender disappear in their lives.&lt;ref name="Bhana, D. 2009"/&gt;

===Middle childhood===
A lifespan perspective must be considered when discussing gender normalization. But one must also consider [[cultural hegemony]] in this stage of the lifespan as a child develops more of an understanding of their culture and begins to display original ideas of cultural norms as well as social norms.&lt;ref name="Liben"/&gt; According to the constructivist emphasis, the man/woman dichotomy is not the "natural" state, but rather a potent metaphor in Western cultures.&lt;ref name="Spector-Mersel, G. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Spector-Mersel | first = Gabriela | title = Never-aging stories: Western hegemonic masculinity scripts | journal = [[Journal of Gender Studies]] | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | pages = 67&amp;ndash;82 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/09589230500486934 | date = 2006 | url = https://doi.org/10.1080/09589230500486934 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building social relationships and developing individuality are essential benchmarks for this age of middle childhood, which ranges from eight years old to puberty.  A young boy is trying to navigate falling within the [[social structure]] that has been laid out for him, which includes interacting with both sexes, and a dominant notion of maleness.  The gender environmentalism, which emphasizes the role of societal practices in generating and maintaining gender differentiation, still plays a part in this stage of life, but is possibly more influenced by immediate and close interactions with boys close to their age.&lt;ref name="Liben"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Liben | first1 = Lynn S. | last2 = Bigler | first2 = Rebecca S. | title = The developmental course of gender differentiation: Conceptualizing, measuring, and evaluating constructs and pathways | journal = Monographs of The Society for Research in Child Development | volume = 67 | issue = 2 | pages = i&amp;ndash;viii and 1&amp;ndash;183 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | jstor = 3181530 | pmid = 12465575 | date = 2002 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mono.2002.67.issue-2/issuetoc | ref = harv | postscript = . | doi=10.1111/mono.2002.67.issue-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boys organize themselves in a hierarchical structure in which the high-status boys decide what is acceptable and valued – that which is hegemonically masculine – and what is not. A boy's rank in the hierarchy is chiefly determined by his athletic ability.&lt;ref name="McGuffey, S. 2011"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = McGuffey | first1 = C. Shawn | last2 = Rich | first2 = B. Lindsay | chapter = Playing in the gender transgression zone: Race, class, and hegemonic masculinity in middle childhood|chapterurl= https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mKn99NiaSZQC&amp;pg=PA166 | editor-last1 = Spade | editor-first1 = Joan Z. | editor-last2 = Valentine | editor-first2 = Catherine G. | title = The kaleidoscope of gender: prisms, patterns, and possibilities | pages = 166&amp;ndash;176 | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Los Angeles, California | year = 2011 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 9781412979061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One site where gender is performed and socialized is in sport. Violent sports such as football are fundamental in naturalizing the equation of maleness with violence.&lt;ref name="Messner, Michael A 1990"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Messner | first = Michael A. | author-link = Michael Messner | title = When bodies are weapons: Masculinity and violence in sport | journal = [[International Review for the Sociology of Sport]] | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 203&amp;ndash;220 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/101269029002500303 | date = September 1990 | url = https://doi.org/10.1177/101269029002500303 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Displays of strength and violence, through sports like football, help to naturalize elements of competition and hierarchy as inherently male behaviour.&lt;ref name="Messner, Michael A 1990" /&gt; There is considerable evidence that males are hormonally predisposed to higher levels of aggression on average that females, due to the effects of testosterone.&lt;ref name="Batrinos, Menelaos L 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Batrinos | first = Menelaos L. | title = Testosterone and aggressive behavior in man | journal = International Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 563&amp;ndash;568 | publisher = Kowsar Medical (Tehran) | pmc = 3693622 | date = Summer 2012 | ref = harv | postscript = . | pmid=23843821 | doi=10.5812/ijem.3661}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the violent and competitive nature of sports like football can only be an exclusively masculine domain if girls and women are excluded from participating altogether. The only means through which women are permitted to participate in football is as the passive spectator or cheerleader, although women do sometimes participate in other violent contact sports, such as boxing.

When a child engages in behaviour or uses something that is more often associated with the opposite sex, this is referred to as crossing gender borders. When gender borders are crossed in adolescence, the children are policed by themselves.&lt;ref name="Laemmle, J. 2013"/&gt; Conflicts and disagreements between boys are resolved by name-calling and teasing, physical aggression, and exclusion from the group.&lt;ref name="McGuffey, S. 2011"/&gt; This brings confusion to the natural order of building their individualism, and stifles their creativity and freeplay, critical to developing lifelong skills in problem solving and decision making.&lt;ref name="Oransky, M. 2009"/&gt; Another notion which further confuses youth is "multiple masculinities" is introduced where variables such as social class, race, ethnicity, generation, and family status determines how these young men must perform their masculinity.&lt;ref name="Spector-Mersel, G. 2006"/&gt; Boys who fail to fit the social norm are forced to enter adolescence having experienced alienation from their social group and marginalized from the social order they strive to achieve in this stage of life.&lt;ref name="McGuffey, S. 2011"/&gt;

===Adolescence===

The last stage of [[childhood]], [[adolescence]], marks the onset of puberty and the eventual beginning of adulthood. Hegemonic masculinity then positions some boys, and all girls, as subordinate or inferior to others.&lt;ref name="Laemmle, J. 2013"/&gt; [[Bullying]] is another avenue in which young men assert their dominance over less "masculine" boys. In this bullying schema, adolescent boys are motivated to be at the top of the scale by engaging in more risk taking activities as well. Oftentimes bullying is motivated by social constructs and generalized ideas of what a young man should be. [[Gendered sexuality]] in adolescence refers to the role gender takes in the adolescent's life and how it is informed by and impacts others' perceptions of their sexuality. This can lead to gay bashing and other forms of discrimination if young men seem not to perform the appropriate masculinity.

The male gender role is not biologically fixed, yet it is a result of the internalization of culturally defined gender norms and ideologies.&lt;ref name="Oransky, M. 2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Oransky | first1 = Matthew | last2 = Fisher | first2 = Celia | title = The development and validation of the meaning of adolescent masculinity scale | journal = [[Psychology of Men and Masculinity]] | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 57&amp;ndash;72 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/a0013612 | date = 2009 | url = https://doi.org/10.1037/a0013612 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this stage this is an important point as developmental psychologists recognize change in relations with parents, peers, and even their own self-identity. This is a time of confusion and disturbance; they feel influenced as a result of asserted hegemonic masculinity as well as social factors that lead them to become more self-conscious. De Visser et al.,&lt;ref name="de Visser"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = de Visser | first1 = Richard O. | last2 = McDonnell | first2 = Elizabeth J. | title = Man points: masculine capital and young men's health | journal = [[Health Psychology (journal)|Health Psychology]] | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 5&amp;ndash;14 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/a0029045 | pmid = 22888820  | date = January 2013 | url = https://doi.org/10.1037/a0029045 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; show that although men need not engage in all masculine behaviour to be considered masculine, enacting in more masculine behaviours increases the likelihood they will be considered more masculine, otherwise known as building "masculine capital". It has been suggested that boys' emotional stoicism leaves them unable to recognize their own and others' emotions, which leaves a risk for developing psychological distress and empty interpersonal skills.&lt;ref name="Oransky, M. 2009"/&gt; Boys in their adolescence are pressured to act masculine in order to fit the hegemonic ideals, yet the possibility of suffering long-term psychological damage as a result looms overhead.&lt;ref name ="de Visser"/&gt;

== Media representations ==
The 1995 documentary, ''[[The Celluloid Closet]]'' discusses the depictions of homosexuals throughout film history. Furthermore, considering the media so heavily associates masculinity with heterosexual sex, it is no wonder that gay men in the media are given more feminine attributes, such as fragility, sensitivity, and a disregard for violence. Their disinterest in objectifying women's bodies makes them appear unmasculine. In [[Jackson Katz]]'s film ''Tough Guise'': ''Violence, Media &amp; the Crisis in Masculinity'', he explains:
{{quote|We can't show any emotion except anger. We can't think too much or seem too intelligent. We can't back down when someone disrespects us. We have to show we're tough enough to inflict physical pain and take it in turn. We're supposed to be sexually aggressive with women. And then we're taught that if we step out of this box, we risk being seen as soft, weak, feminine, or gay&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Jhally|first=Sut|title=Tough Guise: Violence, Media &amp; the Crisis in Masculinity|date=1 January 2000|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1139643/|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Applications==

===Education===

Hegemonic masculinity has been used in education studies to understand the dynamics of classroom life, including patterns of resistance and bullying among boys. It was also used to explore relations to the curriculum and the difficulties in gender-neutral pedagogy.&lt;ref name=Martino&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Martino | first = Wayne | title = Boys and literacy: Exploring the construction of hegemonic masculinities and the formation of literate capacities for boys in the English classroom | journal = [[Australian Association for the Teaching of English#Publications|English in Australia]] | volume = 112 | pages = 11&amp;ndash;24 | publisher = [[Australian Association for the Teaching of English]] | date = July 1995 | url = https://www.aate.org.au/journals/sample-journal-articles | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used to understand teaching strategies and teacher identities among such groups as physical education instructors.&lt;ref name=Skelton&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Skelton | first = A. | title = On becoming a male physical education teacher: the informal culture of students and the construction of hegemonic masculinity | journal = [[Gender and Education]] | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 289&amp;ndash;303 | publisher = [[Taylor and Francis]] | doi = 10.1080/0954025930050305 | date = 1993 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0954025930050305 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept has also been helpful in structuring violence-prevention programs for youth.&lt;ref name=Denbor&gt;{{citation | last = Denborough | first = David | contribution = Step by step: Developing respectful and effective ways of working with young men to reduce violence | editor-last1 = McLean | editor-first1 = Christopher | editor-last2 = Carey | editor-first2 = Maggie | editor-last3 = White | editor-first3 = Cheryl | title = Men's ways of being | pages = 91&amp;ndash;116 | publisher = Westview Press | location = Boulder, Colorado | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780813326535 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and emotional education programs for boys.&lt;ref name=SalisJack&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Salisbury | first1 = Jonathan | last2 = Jackson | first2 = David | title = Challenging macho values: practical ways of working with adolescent boys | publisher = Falmer Press | location = London | year = 1996 | isbn = 9780750704847 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminology===

Hegemonic masculinity has greatly influenced criminology as data reflects that men and boys perpetuate more conventional crimes and more serious crimes than women and girls. Moreover, men are responsible for much more [[white-collar crime]]s than women as well. The concept of hegemonic masculinity helped in theorizing the relationship among masculinities and a variety of crimes.&lt;ref name=Mess1993&gt;{{cite book | last = Messerschmidt | first = James W. | title = Masculinities and Crime : Critique and Reconceptualization of Theory | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | location = Lanham, Maryland | year = 1993 | isbn = 9780847678693 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used in studies on specific crimes by boys and men, such as rape in Switzerland, murder in Australia, football hooliganism and white-collar crime in England, and assaultive violence in the United States.&lt;ref name=NewStank&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Newburn | first1 = Tim | last2 = Stanko | first2 = Elizabeth A. | title = Just boys doing business? Men, masculinities, and crime | publisher = Routledge | location = London New York | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780415093200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding costs and consequences, research in criminology showed how particular patterns of aggression were linked with hegemonic masculinity, not because criminals already had dominant positions, but because they were pursuing them.&lt;ref name=Bufkin&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Bufkin | first = Jana L. | title = Bias crime as gendered behavior | journal = [[Social Justice (journal)|Social Justice]], special issue: Human Rights, Gender Politics &amp; Postmodern Discourses | volume = 26 | issue = 1 | pages = 155&amp;ndash;176 | publisher =  | jstor = 29767117 | date = Spring 1999 | url = http://www.socialjusticejournal.org/?product=jana-bufkin-2 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media and sports===
Hegemonic masculinity has also been employed in studying media representations of men. Because the concept of hegemony helps to make sense of both the diversity and the selectiveness of images in mass media, media researchers have begun mapping the relations between different masculinities.&lt;ref name=Hanke&gt;{{cite book | last = Hanke | first = Robert | chapter = Redesigning men: Hegemonic masculinity in transition | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GJA7CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT6 | editor-last = Craig | editor-first = Steve | title = Men, masculinity and the media | publisher = SAGE Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780803941632 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Portrayals of masculinity in men's lifestyle magazines have been studied and researchers found elements of hegemonic masculinity woven throughout them.&lt;ref name=Ricc&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ricciardelli | first1 = Rosemary | last2 = Clow | first2 = Kimberley A. | last3 = White | first3 = Philip | title = Investigating hegemonic masculinity: Portrayals of masculinity in men’s lifestyle magazines | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 63 | issue = 1&amp;ndash;2 | pages = 64&amp;ndash;78 | publisher = [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11199-010-9764-8 | date = July 2010 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-010-9764-8 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rose_Ricciardelli/publication/225204116_Investigating_Hegemonic_Masculinity_Portrayals_of_Masculinity_in_Men's_Lifestyle_Magazines/links/02e7e538e358f2b2d3000000.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Commercial sports are a focus of media representations of masculinity, and the developing field of sports sociology found significant use of the concept of hegemonic masculinity.&lt;ref name=Messner1992&gt;{{cite book | last = Messner | first = Michael A. | author-link = Michael Messner | title = Power at play: sports and the problem of masculinity | publisher = Beacon Press | location = Boston | year = 1992 | isbn = 9780807041048 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was deployed in understanding the popularity of body-contact confrontational sports which function as an endlessly renewed symbol of masculinity and in understanding the violence and homophobia frequently found in sporting environments.&lt;ref name=MessSabo&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Messner | editor-first1 = Michael A. | editor-last2 = Sabo | editor-first2 = Donald F. | editor-link1 = Michael Messner | title = Sport, men, and the gender order: critical feminist perspectives | publisher = Human Kinetics Books | location = Champaign, Illinois | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780873224215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; American football, and the prevalence of concussions in the sport, is a particularly salient example of the impacts of hegemonic masculinity. With the dominant mode of hegemonic masculinity valuing emotionlessness, invulnerability, toughness, and risk-taking, concussions have become normalized. Players have accepted them as simply "part of the game". If a man does not play through a concussion, he risks being blamed for the team's loss, or labelled as effeminate. It is noble to play in pain, nobler to play in agony, and noblest if one never exhibits any sign of pain at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Burton Nelson | first = Mariah | title = The stronger women get, the more men love football: sexism and the American culture of sports | publisher = Harcourt Brace | location = New York | year = 1994 | isbn = 9780151813933 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coaches buy into this unwritten code of masculinity as well, by invoking euphemisms such as "he needs to learn the difference between injury and pain", while also questioning a player's masculinity to get him back on the field quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Fainaru | first1 = Steve | last2 = Fainaru-Wada | first2 = Mark | title = League of denial: the NFL, concussions, and the battle for truth | publisher = Three Rivers Press | location = New York | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780770437565 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Players, coaches, and trainers subscribe to the hegemonic model, thus creating a culture of dismissiveness, often resulting in concussions, which can lead to brain diseases like CTE.

===Health===

Hegemonic masculinity has been increasingly used to understand men's health practices and determinants. Practices such as playing through physical injuries and risk-taking sexual behaviour such as unprotected sex with multiple partners have been studied.&lt;ref name=SaboGor&gt;{{cite book | editor-last1 = Sabo | editor-first1 = Donald F. | editor-last2 = Gordon | editor-first2 = David F. | title = Men's health and illness: gender, power, and the body | publisher = Sage Publications | location = Thousand Oaks, California | year = 1995 | isbn = 9780803952751 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has also been used to understand men's exposure to risk and their difficulty in responding to disability and injury.&lt;ref name=Gerschick&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gerschick | first1 = Thomas J. | last2 = Miller | first2 = Adam Stephen | title = Gender identities at the crossroads of masculinity and physical disability | journal = Masculinities | volume =  2 | issue = 1 | pages = 34&amp;ndash;55 | publisher = Men's Studies Association | issn = 1072-8538 | oclc = 936771714 | date = 1994 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}

Men are less likely than women to seek professional services psychiatrists or counsellors, informal help through friends, and are more likely to report that they would never seek psychotherapy for depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Addis | first1 = Michael E. | last2 = Mahalik | first2 = James R. | title = Men, masculinity, and the  contexts of help seeking | journal = [[American Psychologist]] | volume = 58 | issue = 1 | pages = 5&amp;ndash;14 | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] via [[PsycINFO|PsycNET]] | doi = 10.1037/0003-066X.58.1.5 | pmid = 12674814 | date = 5 January 2003 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.58.1.5 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10822409_Men_Masculinity_and_the_Contexts_of_Help_Seeking Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, men who adhere to the masculine norm of stoicism have difficulty in identifying grief, sadness, or a depressed mood, some of the conventional diagnostic symptoms of depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Addis | first = Michael E. | title = Gender and depression in men | journal = Clinical Psychology: Science and Practice | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 153&amp;ndash;168 | publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley]] | doi = 10.1111/j.1468-2850.2008.00125.x | date = September 2008 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2850.2008.00125.x | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognition of weakness would be a recognition of femininity, and as such, men distract themselves, avoid the problem, or get angry – one of the few emotions permissible under hegemonic masculine norms – when depressive symptoms surface.

===Organizations===

Hegemonic masculinity has proved significant in organizational studies as the gendered character of workplaces and bureaucracies has been increasingly recognized.&lt;ref name=ConMes2005/&gt; A particular focus has been placed on the military, where specific patterns of hegemonic masculinity have been entrenched but have been increasingly problematic.&lt;ref name=Mes2010&gt;{{cite book | last = Messerschmidt | first = James W. | title = Hegemonic masculinities and camouflaged politics: unmasking the Bush dynasty and its war against Iraq | publisher = Paradigm Publishers | location = Boulder, Colorado | year = 2010 | isbn = 9781594518171 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies found that negative hegemonically masculine characteristics related to violence and aggression were required to thrive in the military at all ranks and in all branches. Additionally homophobic ideals were commonplace and further subordinated men in these positions. Studies have also traced the institutionalization of hegemonic masculinities in specific organizations and their role in organizational decision making.&lt;ref name=Mess1995&gt;{{cite journal | last = Messerschmidt | first = James W. | title = Managing to kill: Masculinities and the Space Shuttle Challenger explosion | journal = Masculinities | volume =  3 | issue = 4 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;22 | publisher = Men's Studies Association | issn = 1072-8538 | oclc = 936763962 | date = 1995 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}

"Tough guy" attributes like unwillingness to admit ignorance, admit mistakes, or ask for help can undermine [[safety culture]] and productivity, by interfering with exchange of useful information. A Harvard Business School study found an intervention to improve the culture at [[Shell Oil]] during the construction of the [[Ursa tension leg platform]] contributed to increased productivity and an 84% lower accident rate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/06/17/482203447/invisibilia-how-learning-to-be-vulnerable-can-make-life-safer Invisibilia: How Learning To Be Vulnerable Can Make Life Safer]&lt;/ref&gt;

===War, international relations, and militarism===
Hegemonic masculinity has impacted both conflict and [[international relations]], serving as a foundation for [[militarism]]. Charlotte Hooper discusses how [[US foreign policy]], following the [[Vietnam War]], was seen as a way of bolstering America's manhood.&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hooper | first = Charlotte | title = Masculinities, IR and the 'gender variable': a cost-benefit analysis for (sympathetic) gender sceptics | journal = [[Review of International Studies]] | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | pages = 475&amp;ndash;480 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | doi = 10.1017/s0260210599004751 | date = July 1999 | url = https://doi.org/10.1017/s0260210599004751 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that the Vietcong, often categorized "as a bunch of women and children", had humiliated and emasculated America.&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; In order to regain its manhood – both domestically and internationally – America needed to develop a [[hypermasculinity|hyper-masculinized]] and aggressive breed of foreign policy. Hooper also discusses the idea that since the international sphere is largely composed of men, it may greatly shape both "the production and maintenance of masculinities."&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; War, then, exists in a unique feedback loop whereby it is not only perpetuated by hegemonic masculinity, but also legitimates masculinity.

Hooper discusses how military combat has been fundamental to the very composition of masculinity "symbolically, institutionally", and culturally through body shape.&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; Moreover, Hooper discusses how women are seen as life givers, while men are believed to be life takers.&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; As a result, men can only exist as men if they are willing to charge into war, thereby expressing their "enduring 'natural aggression'."&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; Furthermore, this perception also explains the traditional "exclusion of women from combat", while furthering the myth "that military service is the fullest expression of masculinity."&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; This has troubling implications for the continuation of war, and for the enshrinement of masculine norms. Hooper also ideates about the instillation of militarized masculinity in boys, discussing how military service is a "rite of passage" for young men.&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; As such, "war and the military represent one of the major sites where hegemonic masculinities" are formed and enshrined.&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt;

Militarized hegemonic masculinity has also impacted perceptions of citizenship as well as the [[LGBT community]]. Conscription is fairly common throughout the world, and has also been utilized in America during key conflicts. The majority of men expect conscription to be the price of adult citizenship, but religious objectors and homosexuals have been largely excluded from this.&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; These restrictions have led to the perceived subordinate status of these groups, and their subsequent exclusion from full citizenship, in the same fashion that women have been excluded.&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; This is reflective of the notion that men unable to, or unwilling to fight for their country are more effeminate, as they are breaking with hegemonic norms. The perceptions that homosexuals are unfit for service, and that women have a responsibility at home, is reflective of the heteronormative nature of the military. The institutional composition of the military, itself, reinforces this hegemony through the armed branch's subordination to a "dominating and organizationally competent" branch.&lt;ref name="Hooper 1999 475–480"/&gt; Essentially, there is an armed wing, which is masculinized through conflict, and there is a dominating branch that is masculinized through power. The hierarchical nature of the military is used to enforce, replicate, and enhance hegemonic masculinity.

Male rape is especially prevalent in male dominant environments, such as in the military and prison. In a 2014 ''[[GQ]]'' article titled "'Son, Men Don't Get Raped'",&lt;ref name="Penn 2014"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Penn |first=Nathaniel |year=2014 |title='Son, Men Don't Get Raped' |url=https://www.gq.com/story/male-rape-in-the-military |magazine=GQ |volume=84 |issue=9 |access-date=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; nearly 30 sexual assault survivors come forward to discuss rape in the military.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} According to the Pentagon, 38 military men are sexually assaulted every day.&lt;ref name="Penn 2014"/&gt; The majority of the victims' stories involve a highly ranked perpetrator, such as senior aides, recruiters, or sergeants, which are positions that young soldiers look up to. Some victims describe being weaker than the attacker and physically unable to stop the rape, while others felt too mentally dominated to speak up. Either way, the men were met with defeat and emasculation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} In the article, the psychologist James Asbrand, who specializes in [[posttraumatic stress disorder]], explains, "The rape of a male soldier has a particular symbolism. 'In a hyper masculine culture, what's the worst thing you can do to another man?' Force him into what the culture perceives as a feminine role. Completely dominate and rape him."&lt;ref name="Penn 2014"/&gt; Asbrand refers to the military as a hypermasculine environment,&lt;ref name="Penn 2014"/&gt; which is consistent with its media portrayal. Joining the army is considered a noble act for men, which military movies, advertisements, and video games reinforce. Because of this, it is no surprise that recruits would likely embody stereotypical masculine personas, and therefore contribute to an environment of competition.

==Toxic masculinity==

Connell argues that a salient feature of hegemonic masculinity is the use of "toxic" practices such as physical violence, which may serve to reinforce men's dominance over women in Western societies.{{refn|name=ConMes2005}} Other scholars have used the term ''toxic masculinity'' to refer to stereotypically masculine  [[gender role]]s that restrict the kinds of [[emotion]]s allowable for boys and men to express, including social expectations that men seek to be dominant (the "[[alpha male]]") and limit their emotional range primarily to expressions of [[anger]].{{refn|name=Liu 2016}}

===In psychology===

Terry Kupers defines toxic masculinity as "the constellation of socially regressive male traits that serve to foster domination, the devaluation of women, homophobia and wanton violence".{{refn|name=Kupers 2005}}{{refn|name=Kupers 2010}} According to Kupers, toxic masculinity serves to outline aspects of hegemonic masculinity that are socially destructive, "such as [[misogyny]], homophobia, greed, and violent domination". These traits are contrasted with more positive aspects of hegemonic masculinity such as "pride in [one's] ability to win at sports, to maintain solidarity with a friend, to succeed at work, or to provide for [one's] family".{{refn|name=Kupers 2005}}

Toxic masculine norms are a feature of life for men in American [[prison]]s, where they are reflected in the behaviour of both staff and inmates. The qualities of extreme self-reliance, domination of other men through violence, and avoiding the appearance of either [[femininity]] or weakness, comprise an unspoken code among prisoners.{{refn|name=Kupers 2004}}{{refn|name=Kupers 2007}} Suppressing vulnerable emotions is often adopted in order to successfully cope with the harsh conditions of prison life, defined by [[punishment]], social isolation, and aggression. These factors likely play a role in [[Prisoner suicide|suicide among male prisoners]].{{refn|name=Kupers 2004}}{{refn|name=Mankowski &amp; Smith}}

Bullying of boys by their peers and domestic violence experienced by boys at home can also be expressions of toxic masculinity.{{refn|name=Keith}} The often violent socialization of boys produces psychological trauma through the promotion of aggression and lack of interpersonal connection. Such trauma is often disregarded, such as in the saying "boys will be boys" with regard to bullying.{{refn|name=Liu 2017}}

===Health effects===

Men who adhere to traditionally masculine cultural norms, such as risk-taking, [[violence]], dominance, primacy of work, need for emotional control, desire to win, and pursuit of [[social status]], tend to be more likely to experience psychological problems such as [[depression (mood)|depression]], [[stress (psychology)|stress]], [[body image]] problems, [[substance abuse]], and poor social functioning.{{refn|name=Wong et al.}} The effect tends to be stronger in men who also emphasize masculine norms, such as self-reliance, seeking power over women, and sexual promiscuity or "playboy" behaviour.{{refn|name=Kaplan}}{{refn|name=Panko}}

The social value of self-reliance has diminished over time as modern American society has moved more toward interdependence.{{refn|name=Weir}} Both self-reliance and the stifling of emotional expression can work against [[mental health]], as they make it less likely for men to seek psychological help or to possess the ability to deal with difficult emotions.{{refn|name=Weir}} Preliminary research suggests that cultural pressure for men to be stoic and self-reliant may also shorten men's lifespans by causing them to be less likely to discuss health problems with their physicians.{{refn|name=Horowitz}}{{refn|name=Ellis}}

===Men's movements===

Some authors associated with the [[mythopoetic men's movement]] have referred to the social pressures placed upon men to be violent, competitive, independent, and unfeeling as a "toxic" form of masculinity, in contrast to a "real" or "deep" masculinity that they say men have lost touch with in modern society.{{refn|name=Ferber}}{{refn|name=Longwood}} The academic [[Shepherd Bliss]] proposed a return to [[agrarianism]] as an alternative to the "potentially toxic masculinity" of the warrior ethic.{{refn|name=Hartman}} Sociologist [[Michael Kimmel]] writes that Bliss's notion of toxic masculinity can be seen as part of the mythopoetic movement's response to male feelings of powerlessness at a time when the [[feminist movement]] was challenging traditional male authority:

{{quote|Thus Shepherd Bliss, for example, rails against what he calls "toxic masculinity"&amp;nbsp;– which he believes is responsible for most of the evil in the world&amp;nbsp;– and proclaims the unheralded goodness of the men who fight the fires and till the soil and nurture their families.{{refn|name=Kimmel 1995}}}}

The '''hierarchy of the sciences''' is a theory formulated by [[Auguste Comte]] in the 19th century. This theory states that science develops over time beginning with the simplest and most general scientific discipline, [[astronomy]], which is the first to reach the "positive stage" (one of three in Comte's [[law of three stages]]). As one moves down the "hierarchy", this theory further states that sciences become more complex and less general, and that they will reach the positive stage later. Disciplines further down the hierarchy are said to depend more on the developments of their predecessors; the highest discipline on the hierarchy is the [[social sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://media.pfeiffer.edu/lridener/DSS/Comte/COMTEW4.HTML |title=Comte - The Work - Hierarchy of the Sciences |website=media.pfeiffer.edu |access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this theory, there are higher levels of consensus and faster rates of advancement in [[physics]] and other [[natural sciences]] than there are in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cole |first=Stephen |date=July 1983 |title=The Hierarchy of the Sciences? |url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/227835 |journal=American Journal of Sociology |language=en |volume=89 |issue=1 |pages=111–139 |doi=10.1086/227835 |issn=0002-9602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
Research has shown that, after controlling for the number of hypotheses being tested, positive results are 2.3 times more likely in the social sciences than in the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fanelli |first=Daniele |date=2010-04-07 |title="Positive" Results Increase Down the Hierarchy of the Sciences |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010068 |journal=PLOS ONE |language=en |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=e10068 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010068 |pmc=2850928 |pmid=20383332}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been found that the degree of [[scientific consensus]] is highest in the physical sciences, lowest in the social sciences, and intermediate in the [[biological sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Fanelli |first=Daniele |last2=Glänzel |first2=Wolfgang |date=2013-06-26 |title=Bibliometric Evidence for a Hierarchy of the Sciences |url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0066938 |journal=PLOS ONE |language=en |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=e66938 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0066938 |pmc=3694152 |pmid=23840557}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dean Simonton]] argues that a composite measure of the scientific status of disciplines ranks [[psychology]] much closer to biology than to sociology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Simonton |first=Dean Keith |date=2004 |title=Psychology's Status as a Scientific Discipline: Its Empirical Placement Within an Implicit Hierarchy of the Sciences. |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-11097-002 |journal=Review of General Psychology |language=en |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=59–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hydropower''' or '''water power''' (from  {{lang-el|ύδωρ}}, "water") is [[power (physics)|power]] derived from the [[energy]] of falling water or fast running water, which may be harnessed for useful purposes. Since ancient times, hydropower from many kinds of [[watermill]]s has been used as a [[renewable energy]] source for [[irrigation]] and the operation of various mechanical devices, such as [[gristmill]]s, [[sawmill]]s, [[textile]] mills, [[trip hammer]]s, dock [[crane (machine)|cranes]], domestic [[elevator|lifts]], and [[ore]] mills. A [[trompe]], which produces compressed air from falling water, is sometimes used to power other machinery at a distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://energy.gov/eere/water/history-hydropower|title=History of Hydropower {{!}} Department of Energy|website=energy.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.niagarafrontier.com/power.html|title=Niagara Falls History of Power|website=www.niagarafrontier.com|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, hydropower has
became a source for generating [[electricity]]. [[Cragside]] in Northumberland was the first house powered by hydroelectricity in 1878&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/cragside/|title=Cragside Visitor Information|publisher=The National Trust|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first commercial hydroelectric power plant was built at [[Niagara Falls]] in 1879. In 1881, street lamps in the city of Niagara Falls were powered by hydropower.

Since the early 20th century, the term has been used almost exclusively in conjunction with the modern development of [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power]].  International institutions such as the [[World Bank]] view hydropower as a means for [[economic development]] without adding substantial amounts of carbon to the atmosphere,&lt;ref name=WP5813&gt;{{cite news|title=World Bank turns to hydropower to square development with climate change|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-08/business/39105348_1_jim-yong-kim-world-bank-hydropower|accessdate=9 May 2013|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=8 May 2013|author=Howard Schneider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File: WATER-POWERED ORE MILL, TAKEN FROM SOUTH - Liberty Historic District, Water Powered Ore Mill, Route 2, Cle Elum, Liberty, Kittitas County, WA HABS WASH,19-LIB,1W-1.tif|thumb|Directly water-powered ore mill, late nineteenth century]]

In [[History of India|India]], [[water wheel]]s and [[watermill]]s were built, possibly as early as the 4th century BC, although records of that era are spotty at best.&lt;ref&gt;Terry S. Reynolds, ''Stronger than a Hundred Men: A History of the Vertical Water Wheel'', JHU Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0801872480}}, page 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Empire]], water-powered mills produced flour from grain, and were also used for sawing timber and stone; in China, watermills were widely used since the [[Han dynasty]].  In [[China]] and the rest of the Far East, hydraulically operated "pot wheel" pumps raised water into crop or irrigation canals.{{when|date=August 2015}}

The power of a wave of water released from a tank was used for extraction of metal ores in a method known as [[hushing]]. The method was first used at the [[Dolaucothi Gold Mines]] in [[Wales]] from 75 AD onwards, but had been developed in [[Spain]] at such mines as [[Las Médulas]]. Hushing was also widely used in [[Great Britain|Britain]] in the [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and later periods to extract [[lead]] and [[tin]] ores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hunt|first1=Robert|title=British Mining: A Treatise in the History, Discovery, Practical Development, and Future Prospects of Metalliferous Mines of the United Kingdom|date=1887|publisher=Crosby Lockwood and Co|location=London|page=505|edition=2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MQU55QQHRGcC&amp;pg=PA505&amp;lpg=PA505#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later evolved into [[hydraulic mining]] when used during the [[California Gold Rush]].

In the [[Middle Ages]], Islamic mechanical engineer [[Al-Jazari]] described designs for 50 devices, many of them water powered, in his book, ''The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices'', including clocks, a device to serve wine, and five devices to lift water from rivers or pools, though three are animal-powered and one can be powered by animal or water. These include [[Scoop wheel|an endless belt with jugs attached]], a cow-powered [[shadoof]], and a reciprocating device with hinged valves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Al-Hassani|first1=Salim|title=800 Years Later: In Memory of Al-Jazari, A Genius Mechanical Engineer|url=http://muslimheritage.com/article/800-years-later-memory-al-jazari-genius-mechanical-engineer|website=Muslim Heritage|publisher=The Foundation for Science, Technology, and Civilisation|accessdate=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better ref needed|date=November 2015}}

In 1753, French engineer [[Bernard Forest de Bélidor]] published ''Architecture Hydraulique'' which described vertical- and horizontal-axis hydraulic machines. By the late nineteenth century, the [[electric generator]] was developed by a team led by [[project managers]] and prominent pioneers of renewable energy [[Jacob S. Gibbs]] and [[Brinsley Coleberd]] and could now be coupled with hydraulics.&lt;ref name="doehis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/hydro_history.html |title=History of Hydropower |publisher=US Department of Energy |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126001540/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/hydro_history.html |archivedate=26 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The growing demand for the [[Industrial Revolution]] would drive development as well.&lt;ref name="watenc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydroelectric Power|url=http://www.waterencyclopedia.com/Ge-Hy/Hydroelectric-Power.html|publisher=Water Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the Industrial Revolution in Britain, water was the main source of power for new inventions such as [[Richard Arkwright]]'s [[water frame]].&lt;ref name="kreis"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/lecture17a.html|title=The Origins of the Industrial Revolution in England|last=Kreis|first=Steven|year=2001|work=The history guide|accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the use of water power gave way to steam power in many of the larger mills and factories, it was still used during the 18th and 19th centuries for many smaller operations, such as driving the bellows in small [[blast furnace]]s (e.g. the [[Dyfi Furnace]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/mid/sites/history/pages/dyfifurnace.shtml|title=Dyfi Furnace|last=Gwynn|first=Osian|work=BBC Mid Wales History|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[gristmill]]s, such as those built at [[Saint Anthony Falls]], which uses the 50-foot (15&amp;nbsp;m) drop in the [[Mississippi River]].

In the 1830s, at the early peak in the US [[canal]]-building, hydropower provided the energy to transport [[barge]] traffic up and down steep hills using [[Cable railway|inclined plane railroads]].  As railroads overtook canals for transportation, canal systems were modified and developed into hydropower systems; the [[history of Lowell, Massachusetts]] is a classic example of commercial development and industrialization, built upon the availability of water power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.uml.edu/clh/Malone/notes_01.pdf|title=Waterpower in Lowell|publisher=University of Massachusetts|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technological advances had moved the open water wheel into an enclosed [[turbine]] or [[Water engine|water motor]]. In 1848 [[James B. Francis]], while working as head engineer of Lowell's Locks and Canals company, improved on these designs to create a turbine with 90% efficiency.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} He applied scientific principles and testing methods to the problem of turbine design. His mathematical and graphical calculation methods allowed the confident design of high-efficiency turbines to exactly match a site's specific flow conditions.  The [[Francis turbine|Francis reaction turbine]] is still in wide use today. In the 1870s, deriving from uses in the California mining industry, [[Lester Allan Pelton]] developed the high efficiency [[Pelton wheel|Pelton wheel impulse turbine]], which utilized hydropower from the high head streams characteristic of the mountainous California interior.

=== Hydraulic power-pipe networks ===
[[Hydraulic power network]]s used pipes to carry pressurized water and transmit mechanical power from the source to end users. The power source was normally a head of water, which could also be assisted by a pump. These were extensive in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] cities in the United Kingdom. A hydraulic power network was also developed in [[Geneva]], Switzerland. The world-famous [[Jet d'Eau]] was originally designed as the over-pressure relief valve for the network.&lt;ref name=geneva&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geneve-tourisme.ch/?rubrique=0000000172|title=Things to do in Geneva, Switzerland - Geneva Tourism Official Website|website=www.geneve-tourisme.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Compressed air hydro ===
{{See also|Trompe}}
Where there is a plentiful head of water it can be made to generate [[compressed air]] directly without moving parts. In these designs, a falling column of water is purposely mixed with air bubbles generated through turbulence or a venturi pressure reducer at the high-level intake. This is allowed to fall down a shaft into a subterranean, high-roofed chamber where the now-compressed air separates from the water and becomes trapped. The height of the falling water column maintains compression of the air in the top of the chamber, while an outlet, submerged below the water level in the chamber allows water to flow back to the surface at a lower level than the intake. A separate outlet in the roof of the chamber supplies the compressed air. A facility on this principle was built on the [[Montreal River (Timiskaming District)|Montreal River]] at Ragged Shutes near [[Cobalt, Ontario]] in 1910 and supplied 5,000 horsepower to nearby mines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maynard|first=Frank|date=November 1910|title=Five thousand horsepower from air bubbles|journal=Popular Mechanics|pages=633|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-N0DAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydropower types ==
{{Main article|Hydroelectricity}}
Hydropower is used primarily to generate [[electricity]]. Broad categories include:
* [[Hydroelectricity#Generating methods|Conventional hydroelectric]], referring to hydroelectric dams.
* [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity]], which captures the kinetic energy in rivers or streams, without a large reservoir and sometimes without the use of dams.
* [[Small hydro]] projects are 10 megawatts or less and often have no artificial reservoirs.
* [[Micro hydro]] projects provide a few kilowatts to a few hundred kilowatts to isolated homes, villages, or small industries.
* [[Conduit hydroelectricity]] projects utilize water which has already been diverted for use elsewhere; in a municipal water system, for example.
* [[Pumped-storage hydroelectricity]] stores water pumped uphill into reservoirs during periods of low demand to be released for generation when demand is high or system generation is low.
* [[Tidal stream generator|Off-shore Hydropower]] using energy from [[tidal power]] generated from oceans, rivers, and human-made canal systems to generating electricity&lt;ref&gt;http://www.british-hydro.org/tidal-range-off-shore/&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Pressure buffering hydropower]] use natural sources (waves for example) for water pumping to turbines while exceeding water is pumped uphill into reservoirs and releases when incoming water flow isn't enough.

== Calculating the amount of available power ==
A hydropower resource can be evaluated by its available [[Power (physics)|power]]. Power is a function of the [[hydraulic head]] and [[rate of fluid flow]]. The head is the energy per unit weight (or unit mass) of water. The static head is proportional to the difference in height through which the water falls. Dynamic head is related to the velocity of moving water. Each unit of water can do an amount of work equal to its weight times the head.

The power available from falling water can be calculated from the flow rate and density of water, the height of fall, and the local acceleration due to gravity.
In SI units, the power is:

&lt;math&gt;P=\eta\rho\,Qgh\!&lt;/math&gt;

where
* P is power in watts
* η is the dimensionless efficiency of the turbine
* ρ is the density of water in kilograms per cubic metre
* Q is the flow in cubic metres per second
* g is the acceleration due to gravity
* h is the height difference between inlet and outlet in metres

To illustrate, power is calculated for a turbine that is 85% efficient, with water at 1000&amp;nbsp;kg/cubic metre (62.5 pounds/cubic foot) and a flow rate of 80 cubic-meters/second (2800 cubic-feet/second), gravity of 9.81 metres per second squared and with a net head of 145&amp;nbsp;m (480&amp;nbsp;ft).

In SI units:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Power (W)}  = 0.85\times 1000 \times 80 \times 9.81 \times 145 &lt;/math&gt; which gives 97 MW

In English units, the density is given in pounds per cubic foot so acceleration due to gravity is inherent in the unit of weight. A conversion factor is required to change from foot lbs/second to kilowatts:
:&lt;math&gt;\text{Power (W)} = 0.85\times 62.5 \times 2800 \times 480 \times 1.356 &lt;/math&gt; which gives 97 MW (130,000 [[horsepower]])

Operators of hydroelectric stations will compare the total electrical energy produced with the theoretical potential energy of the water passing through the turbine to calculate efficiency. Procedures and definitions for calculation of efficiency are given in test codes such as [[ASME]] PTC 18 and [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 60041. Field testing of turbines is used to validate the manufacturer's guaranteed efficiency. Detailed calculation of the efficiency of a hydropower turbine will account for the head lost due to flow friction in the power canal or penstock, rise in tail water level due to flow, the location of the station and effect of varying gravity, the temperature and barometric pressure of the air, the density of the water at ambient temperature, and the altitudes above sea level of the forebay and tailbay. For precise calculations, errors due to rounding and the number of [[significant digit]]s of constants must be considered.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Some hydropower systems such as [[water wheel]]s can draw power from the flow of a body of water without necessarily changing its height. In this case, the available power is the [[kinetic energy]] of the flowing water. Over-shot water wheels can efficiently capture both types of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=S. K.|first1=Sahdev|title=Basic Electrical Engineering|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=9789332576797|page=418|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The water flow in a stream can vary widely from season to season. Development of a hydropower site requires analysis of [[streamflow|flow records]], sometimes spanning decades, to assess the reliable annual energy supply. Dams and reservoirs provide a more dependable source of power by smoothing seasonal changes in water flow. However reservoirs have significant [[Environmental impact of reservoirs|environmental impact]], as does alteration of naturally occurring stream flow. The design of dams must also account for the worst-case, "probable maximum flood" that can be expected at the site; a [[spillway]] is often included to bypass flood flows around the dam. A computer [[Hydrological modelling|model of the hydraulic basin]] and rainfall and snowfall records are used to predict the maximum flood.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Sustainability ==
{{see also|Environmental impact of reservoirs}}
As with other forms of economic activity, hydropower projects can have both a positive and a negative environmental and social impact, because the construction of a dam and power plant, along with the impounding of a reservoir, creates certain social and physical changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Allure and Perils of Hydropower |url = https://undark.org/article/hydropower-dams-albania-vjosa/|website = www.undark.org|accessdate = 2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;These environmental and social impact are not limited to but include the removal of communities near the dam, as well as the hindrance of fish migration. Since water is being taken away, this also affects local communities access and amount of drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholarworks.uvm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;context=envstheses&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that dams affect the soil, which then alters the ability of vegetation to grow.&lt;ref&gt;https://search-proquest-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/earthatmosphericaquatic/docview/761185281/fulltext/A0F81B52C7504484PQ/13?accountid=14784&lt;/ref&gt;
Hydropower projects can also have indirect consequences, contributing to [[global warming]]: reservoirs accumulate plant material, which then decomposes, emitting [[methane]] in uneven bursts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/09/hundreds-new-dams-could-mean-trouble-our-climate |title=Hundreds of new dams could mean trouble for our climate|work=Science |date=September 28, 2016|accessdate= 2016-10-11 |doi=10.1126/science.aah7356|publisher=AAAS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/50/9/766/269391|title=Reservoir Surfaces as Sources of Greenhouse Gases to the Atmosphere: A Global Estimate: Reservoirs are sources of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, and their surface areas have increased to the point where they should be included in global inventories of anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases|first1=St|last1=Louis|first2=Vincent|last2=L|first3=Carol A.|last3=Kelly|first4=Éric|last4=Duchemin|first5=John W.

There are several tools to assess the impact of hydropower projects:

*Most new hydropower project must undergo an [[Environmental impact assessment|Environmental and Social Impact Assessment]]. This provides a base-line understanding of the pre-project conditions, estimates of potential impacts and puts in place management plans to avoid, mitigate, or compensate for impacts.

*The [[Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Protocol]] is another tool which can be used to promote and guide more sustainable hydropower projects. It is a methodology used to audit the performance of a hydropower project across more than twenty environmental, social, technical and economic topics. A Protocol assessment provides a rapid sustainability health check. It does not replace an environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA), which takes place over a much longer period of time, usually as a mandatory regulatory requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hydropower Sustainability - Home|url = http://www.hydrosustainability.org/|website = www.hydrosustainability.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[World Commission on Dams]] final report describes a framework for planning water and energy projects that is intended to protect dam-affected people and the environment, and ensure that the benefits from dams are more equitably distributed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dams and Development Project|url = http://www.unep.org/dams/WCD/|website = www.unep.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20151118100259/http%3A//www.unep.org/dams/WCD/|archivedate = 18 November 2015|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[International Finance Corporation|IFC]]'s Environmental and Social Performance Standards define IFC clients' responsibilities for managing their environmental and social risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Environmental and Social Performance Standards and Guidance Notes|url = http://www.ifc.org/wps/wcm/connect/topics_ext_content/ifc_external_corporate_site/ifc+sustainability/our+approach/risk+management/performance+standards/environmental+and+social+performance+standards+and+guidance+notes|website = www.ifc.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[World Bank]]’s safeguard policies are used by the Bank to help identify, avoid, and minimize harms to people and the environment caused by investment projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Safeguard Policies|url = http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/PROJECTS/EXTPOLICIES/EXTSAFEPOL/0,,menuPK:584441~pagePK:64168427~piPK:64168435~theSitePK:584435,00.html|website = web.worldbank.org|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7426">The '''Institute of Atmospheric Physics AS CR''', also designated as the '''IAP''',  is part of the [[Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic]] '''(AS CR)'''.  Within the IAP research institutions are combined in order to cover the whole field of [[science]] and [[humanities]].

The IAP was established in 1964, developed from a previously existing institute.  This former institute's main focus was observation, and interpretation of data of [[tropospheric]] processes. In 1994 another former institute joined the IAP which then extended its [[research]] purview to the entire [[atmosphere]], from the [[boundary layer]] up to [[interplanetary space]]. In 2007-2008 the IAP organized several international workshops and meetings.

The institute is staffed by 111 persons (2008) and forty percent of those hold the PhD degree or its equivalent. Throughout the years staff members have published research in a variety of international and national [[peer review]]ed journals, as well as various books, chapters in books, and [[monographs]].  Also, the IAP participates in international research programs, and many international research projects. For example it participates in the Climate and Weather of the Sun-Earth System (CAWSES) program, and the GEO-6 (Galileo for Scientific User Community) research project.&lt;ref name=desribe-info/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufa.cas.cz/en/publications.html List of Publications 1992 - 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science investigations==
Scientific investigation for the IAP is defined by the vertical extent of the atmosphere. Types of investigations include [[theory|theoretical models]], [[numerical simulation]], and [[experiment]] for the Earth's [[boundary layer]], [[troposphere]], [[atmosphere|middle atmosphere]], [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]].&lt;ref name=desribe-info/&gt;

The main research topic areas currently include mesoscale, dynamical, and applied [[meteorology]]. Furthermore, the processes of the atmospheric boundary layer are also of interest.  In addition,  climate variability and [[climate change]] are studied. Other research is conducted that concerns the [[ozone]], along with the previously mentioned ionosphere and magnetosphere. Regarding these upper atmosphere domains, the IAP conducts its own [[satellite]] experiments. Other research extends into space [[plasma physics]]  and solar-terrestrial interactions.&lt;ref name=desribe-info&gt;

  | accessdate =2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Department of Climatology==
The Department of Climatology of the IAP is concerned with two broad research areas. These are climate change research, and statistical climatology.&lt;ref name=Dep-Clim&gt;

{{Cite web| last=Kyselý| first=Jan| author2=Dagmar Novotná (head of department)| title=Department of Climatology (IAP)| date=2010-02-02 | url=http://www.ufa.cas.cz/html/climaero/| format =| accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate change research===
Climate change research includes the observation, analysis, and establishing trends regarding the variations of long-term  extreme warm and cold temperature phenomena in central and south-eastern Europe. Of note is a prevailing warming trend when analysing both the warm and cold events during the 20th century. Also of note are changes in the atmospheric circulation patterns. [[Global Circulation Model]] (GCM) outputs are related to the region of the Czech Republic and central Europe. In addition, this department is developing a ''Regional Climate Model'' in conjunction with another Czech institute and [[Charles University]]. Included in this departments work are impact assessments by constructing climate change scenarios for selected experimental units in the Czech Republic.&lt;ref name=clim-chg-res&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate =2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical climatology===
Various validated statistical models and predictors are employed which provide a platform for research in climate change.  These include ''extreme value analysis'', ''non-linear time series analysis'', ''statistical downscaling'', and the ''stochastic weather generator''.

===Research projects===
The Department of Climatology is involved in research projects listed from ''starting in 2004'' to ''starting in 2008''. Some of the titles are as follows:&lt;ref name=Dep-Clim/&gt;

====2008====
* Probabilistic climate scenarios for the Czech Republic.
* Extraterrestrial effects on atmospheric circulation in mid and high latitudes.
* Effect of climate variability and meteorological extremes on the production of selected crops between 1801 and 2007.&lt;ref name=Dep-Clim/&gt;

====2007====
* Meteorological causes and human mortality impacts of extreme hot weather in summer: a comparative study.
* Effects of short-term and long-term variability of weather on mortality.&lt;ref name=Dep-Clim/&gt;

====2006====
* Central and Eastern Europe Climate Change Impacts and Vulnerability Assessment (CECILIA).
* Climate change impacts on the crop growth and development of selected crops.&lt;ref name=Dep-Clim/&gt;

==Department of Space Physics==
This department is ''Space Plasma Group'', which was founded in 1998 as the Department of Space Physics of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics. Primary investigations of this department are space plasma process which occur in solar-terrestrial interactions. Simulated and experimental data are applied in these studies.&lt;ref name=space-plasma&gt;

  | accessdate =2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other departments==
There are also several other departments, along with five observatories and one detached unit. Notable work from these areas will also be included.

==Organizational structure==
The IAP has a Director, Deputy Director, and Scientific Secretary which comprises the institute's ''Management''.  The Scientific and professional section is divided into six departments, two of which have been discussed above. Each department has its own department head. The administration is made up of the administrative head, librarian, and Secretary to the Director. There is also a board which lists internal and external seated members. In addition, there is a supervisory board with six members, one of whom functions as secretary.&lt;ref name=organization&gt;{{Cite web

'''Kanai Yoshiko''' ('''{{lang-ja|金井淑子}}''', born 1944) is Japanese academic and feminist theorist. She explored the complexities of the feminist movements in Japan and the difficulty in launching women's studies in a society bound by [[gender binary|dualistic]] definitions of gender. Coining the phrase "housewife feminism", she addressed how Japanese society had attempted to appease women without addressing the underlying systemic problems that continued to foster inequality.

==Early life==
Kanai Yoshiko was born in 1944 &lt;!-- on 5 October 1944 --&gt; in [[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], Japan. She graduated from the [[University of Tokyo]] (UT) with a degree in literature and philosophy in 1967 and went on to further her education at UT, earning a master's degree education and ethics.{{sfn|Women's Action Network|2016}}

==Career==
Kanai began her career at the newly established [[Nagaoka Women's Junior College]] in 1971. She was one of the first academics in Japan to focus on [[women's studies]]. She remained at Nagaoka Junior College until 1999, when she accepted a position at [[Yokohama National University]] in the Human Sciences Department. She reached the university's mandatory retirement barrier in 2010 and took a post in the philosophy and letters department at [[Rissho University]], from which she retired in 2015.{{sfn|Women's Action Network|2016}} 

Kanai was most known as a specialist in [[gender studies]] and ethics, writing numerous books analyzing the feminist movement in Japan and its limitations.{{sfn|AMPO Japan-Asia Quarterly Review|2015|p=x}}{{sfn|Chalmers|2003|p=35}} She coined the phrase "housewife feminism" to refer to a particular type of issues-based feminism, where the official response establishes quotas and training to counteract imbalances, but does nothing to address the underlying [[systemic bias]]es.{{sfn|AMPO Japan-Asia Quarterly Review|2015|pp=20-21}}{{sfn|Smith|2013|pp=160-161}} She argued that rather than giving women real power for their own development, the focus of [[identity politics]] on nationalist and traditional aims provided pacifiers, such as men taking on more household duties, and led to continued co-opting of women's ability to define themselves and direct policies which affected them.{{sfn|Loftus|1997}} In turn, she found that no radical feminist movement developed in Japan, because women readily accepted a [[binary gender]] model and succumbed to pressure to define themselves in the role of wife.{{sfn|Chalmers|2003|p=35}} By accepting traditional roles, Japanese motherhood is glorified and a one-size-fits-all approach is used to address issues.{{sfn||Liddle|Nakajimo|2000|p=11}} She has noted that the failure to grasp that "…equality of sexual power [is] a human right of women and sexual violence against women [is] a violation of human rights" was a stumbling block to women's empowerment.{{sfn|Smith|2013|p=161}}

[[File:Juris Doctor diploma.jpg|right|thumb|A typical juris doctor diploma, here from [[Suffolk University Law School]]]]

A '''law school''' (also known as a '''law centre''' or '''college of law''') is an institution specializing in [[legal education]], usually involved as part of a process for becoming a [[lawyer]] within a given jurisdiction.
{{TOC limit|limit=4}}

== Law degrees ==

=== Australia ===
To practice in Australia, one needs to graduate with a Bachelor of Laws (LLB), Juris Doctor (JD), or Diploma-in-Law issued by the Legal Profession Admission Board, followed by an internship for 12 months or an extra course in practical legal training (PLT) depending on the jurisdiction and university, and be admitted as a lawyer of one of a state's Supreme Court.

=== Brazil ===

In Brazil the legal education begins between 1827/28 in Olinda/PE and São Paulo/SP where the first Schools of Law were established by the new Empire using as educational model the Coimbra Faculty of Law.

Nowadays the legal education consists in a 5-year-long course in which, afterwards, the scholar is granted a bachelor´s degree.&lt;ref&gt;portal.mec.gov.br/cne/arquivos/pdf/rces09_04.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, it is considered part of the higher education, hence the educational system is regulated as: i) basic education - primary, middle and high school; and ii) higher education: licentiate, bachelor and vocational ed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brasil.gov.br/educacao/2014/05/saiba-como-e-a-divisao-do-sistema-de-educacao-brasileiro/view|title=Saiba como é a divisão do sistema de educação brasileiro|first=Portal|last=Brasil|website=Governo do Brasil|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513173640/http://www.brasil.gov.br/educacao/2014/05/saiba-como-e-a-divisao-do-sistema-de-educacao-brasileiro/view|archivedate=2016-05-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of law is conditioned upon admission to the bar of a particular state or other territorial jurisdiction (Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil - OAB &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oab.org.br/|title=OAB - Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil - Conselho Federal|author=|date=|website=oab.org.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Public attorneys, public prossecutors and magistrates (judges) admission is made, mainly, through an entrance examination and a constitutional mandatory three years of legal experience. Starting from the second degree courts it is mandatory a 1/5 of its composition to be fulfilled with members of the lawyers/attorneys/barristers association and also from federal/state/labour processcutors (ministério público) regarding the court jurisdiction (it is not applied for electoral and military courts).

After achieving the bachelor´s degree of laws it is possible to follow an i) specialization or follow ii) academically (or both), in either case it is called postgraduation: i) lato sensu; or ii) stricto sensu; respectively.

The postgraduation, stricto sensu, consists in a: a) master´s degree, which is usually a two-year degree; and a b) doctorate´s degree, which can take up another four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capes.gov.br/avaliacao/sobre-a-avaliacao/legislacao-especifica|title=Legislação específica|first=Coordenação de Comunicação Social da|last=Capes|website=www.capes.gov.br|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504090933/http://www.capes.gov.br/avaliacao/sobre-a-avaliacao/legislacao-especifica|archivedate=2016-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given that the Canadian legal system includes both the French civil law and the Anglo-American common law, some law schools offer both an LL.B. or J.D. (common law) and a B.C.L., LL.L. or LL.B. (civil law) degree, such as [[McGill University]], [[University of Ottawa]] and the [[Université de Montréal]]. In particular, [[McGill University Faculty of Law]] offers a combined civil law and common law program, which has been called "transsystemic."&lt;ref&gt;Where Law and Pedagogy Meet in the Transsystemic Contracts Classroom {{cite web |url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/global/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-05-08 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723233130/http://www.law.nyu.edu/global/index.htm |archivedate=2013-07-23 |df= }}. Accessed April 26, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; At other faculties, if a person completes a common law degree, then a civil law degree can be obtained with only an extra year of study. This is also true for civil law graduates who wish to complete a common law degree.

Despite changes in designation, schools opting for the J.D. have not altered their curricula. Neither the J.D. or LL.B. alone is sufficient to qualify for a Canadian license, as each Province's law society requires an apprenticeship and successful completion of provincial skills and responsibilities training course, such as the British Columbia Law Society's Professional Legal Training Course,&lt;ref&gt;Law Society of British Columbia PLTC {{cite web |url=http://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/licensing_membership/pltc/intro.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118195103/http://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/licensing_membership/pltc/intro.html |archivedate=2009-01-18 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Law Society of Upper Canada's Skills and Responsibilities Training Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rc.lsuc.on.ca/jsp/licensingprocesslawyer/sitemap.jsp|title=Law Society of Upper Canada Law Licensing Process|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110054838/http://rc.lsuc.on.ca/jsp/licensingprocesslawyer/sitemap.jsp|archivedate=2009-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bar of Quebec|École du Barreau du Québec]].

The main reason for implementing the J.D. in Canada was to distinguish the degree from the European counterpart that requires no previous post-secondary education,&lt;ref&gt;University of British Columbia Board of Governors approves request for LL.B to be renamed J.D. [https://web.archive.org/web/20080404181432/http://www.law.ubc.ca/news/2008/march/03_18_2008_LLB-JD.html].&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the eyes of the Canadian educational system, the J.D. awarded by Canadian universities has retained the characteristics of the LL.B. and is considered a second entry program, but not a graduate program.&lt;ref&gt;University of Toronto.

{{Main|Legal education in the United Kingdom}}

=== Finland ===
Law school is usually entered to at the undergraduate level in a university. There is an intermediate bachelor's degree (''oikeusnotaari''), but the target is the master's degree in law (''oikeustieteen maisteri''; until 2005 ''oikeustieteen kandidaatti''). Once university education is complete, the title of ''[[varatuomari]]'' (VT) is obtained with an one-year [[externship]] in a district court. This is the basic qualification to practice law. With further experience, the candidate may be admitted to the Finnish Bar Association and licensed with the legally protected title ''[[Advokat|asianajaja]]'', similar to [[barrister]].

===France===
In France, the legal education is a three tier system. The student may study for a LLB (''licence de droit''), then a LLM (''master de droit'') and, for those interested in Law theory, a PhD in Law (''doctorat de droit'').

Many [[universities in France|French universities]] offers Law courses in department labelled as Research and Education Units (''unité de formation et de recherche'') and/or Faculties of Law or Law Schools.

A LLM-level is a prerequisite for some legal professions, but is combined with vocational education, such as the [[école nationale de la magistrature]] for judges and the ''Certificat d'aptitude aux fonctions d'avocat'' for [[advocate]]s.

===Indonesia===
Law Degree in Indonesia consists of three tier systems. The first tier is the Degree of which carries the title of Sarjana Hukum/S.H. (Bachelor of Law). This can be obtained in 4–7 years after they enter Law School straight from Senior High School.

Although it is also common to see other title for secondary tier such as Magister Kenotariatan / M.Kn. (Master in Notary) for Notarial professionals line of work. The second tier can be obtained normally in 1-2 year.

The third tier in Indonesian Law Degree is Doctor / DR. (Doctor in Law).

To work in legal professions of choice in Indonesia, a Bachelor Law Degree (S.H.) is obligatory. Graduates can pursue their career as Legal in-house counsel, Judge profession (requires admission and further training at Supreme Court Educational Center), Public Prosecutor (requires admission and further training at Public Prosecutor Educational and Training Center), other legal-related work and Advocate.

To become an Advocate, Law Graduate should attend an Advocate Special Course (1–2 months) and pass the Bar exam. The title Advocate can be obtained after a graduate passes the Bar exam and fulfill several obligation and requirements created by the Indonesian Advocates Association (PERADI), and is a prerequisite for practicing trial law in Indonesia.

[[Law degree]]s in India are granted and conferred in terms of the Advocates Act, 1961, which is a law passed by the [[Parliament of India|Parliament]] both on the aspect of legal education and also regulation of conduct of legal profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf |title=Advocates Act, 1961 |publisher=Bar Council of India |accessdate=2009-06-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819185257/http://barcouncilofindia.nic.in/disk1/196125.pdf |archivedate=2008-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the act, the [[Bar Council of India]] is the supreme regulatory body to regulate the legal profession in India and also to ensure the compliance of the laws and maintenance of professional standards by the legal profession in the country.

To this regard, the Bar Council of India prescribes the minimum curriculum required to be taught in order for an institution to be eligible for the grant of a law degree. The Bar Council also carries on a periodic supervision of the institutions conferring the degree and evaluates their teaching methodology and curriculum and having determined that the institution meets the required standards, recognizes the institution and the degree conferred by it.

Traditionally the degrees that were conferred carried the title of LL.B. (Bachelor of Laws) or B.L. (Bachelor of Law). The eligibility requirement for these degrees was that the applicant already have a [[Bachelor's degree]] in any subject from a recognized institution. Thereafter the LL.B. / B.L. course was for three years, upon the successful completion of which the applicant was granted either degree.

However, upon the suggestion by the [[Law Commission of India]] and also given the prevailing cry for reform, the Bar Council of India instituted upon an [[National Law School of India University#Experiment in legal education|experiment]] in terms of establishing specialized law universities solely devoted to legal education and thus to raise the academic standards of legal profession in India. This decision was taken somewhere in 1985 and thereafter the first law University in India was set up in [[Bangalore]] which was named as the [[National Law School of India University]] (popularly 'NLS'). These law universities were meant to offer a multi-disciplinary and integrated approach to legal education.  It was therefore for the first time that a law degree other than LL.B. or B.L. was granted in India. [[National Law School of India University|NLS]] offered a five-year law course, upon the successful completion of which an integrated degree with the title of "B.A.,LL.B. (Honours)" would be granted.

Thereafter, [[Autonomous Law Schools in India|other law universities]] were set up, all offering five-year integrated law degrees with different nomenclature. The next in line was [[National Law Institute University]] set up in [[Bhopal]] in 1997. It was followed by NALSAR university of law in 1998. The [[Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University]] in [[Delhi]] offered a five-year integrated law degree course of LL.B (Honours) from 1998 and subsequently from 2007 started to award the B.A.,LL.B / B.B.A.LL.B (Honours). The Mysore University School of Justice set up by the [[University of Mysore]] in [[Mysore]] offered a five-year integrated law degree course of B.A.,LL.B (Honours) from 2007. The course for three years LL.B. is also regularized in [[University of Delhi]] as an option for post graduation after the completion of graduation degree. The [[National Law University, Jodhpur]] offered for the first time in 2001 the integrated law degree of "B.B.A, LL.B. (Honours)" which was preceded by the [[West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences]] offering the "B.Sc., LL.B. (Honours)" degree. [[Gujarat National Law University]] established in [[Gandhinagar]] also offers LL.B.

However, despite these [[Autonomous Law Schools in India|specialized law universities]], the traditional three-year degree continues to be offered in India by other institutions and are equally recognized as eligible qualifications for practicing law in India. Another essential difference that remains is that while the eligibility qualification for the three year law degree is that the applicant must already be a holder of a bachelor's degree, for being eligible for the five years integrated law degree, the applicant must have successfully completed Class XII from a recognized [[Boards of Education in India]].

Both the holders of the three-year degree and of the five-year integrated degree are eligible for enrollment with the Bar Council of India upon the fulfillment of eligibility conditions and upon enrollment, may appear before any court in India.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;''Major Legal Systems in the World Today: An Introduction to the Comparative Study of Law'', by René David, John E.

===Hong Kong===
In [[Legal system of Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], which generally follows the English common law system, an undergraduate L.L.B. is common, followed by a one or two year [[Postgraduate Certificate in Laws]] before one can begin a [[training contract]] (solicitors) or a [[pupillage]] (barristers).

=== Iran ===
In Iran, the legal education has been influenced both by civil law and Islamic Shari'ah law. Like many countries, after high school, one can enter the law school. The first law degree is LL.B. It takes about four years to get LL.B. The first graduate program in law is LL.M. It takes about two to three years to earn an LL.M. The LL.M. is a mix of course work in a specific field of law and a dissertation. The Ph.D. in law is the highest law degree offered by some law schools. It takes about 5–7 years depending on the school as well as the students.

=== Philippines ===
{{main|Legal education in the Philippines}}
Law degree programs are considered graduate programs in the [[Philippines]]. As such, admission to law schools requires the completion of a bachelor's degree, with a sufficient number of credits or units in certain subject areas.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

Graduation from a Philippine law school constitutes the primary eligibility requirement for the [[Philippine Bar Examination]], the national licensure examination for practicing lawyers in the country. The bar examination is administered by the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] during the month of September every year.

As of 2011 the bar examinations were held during November.

The '''[[University of Santo Tomas]] '''[[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law|Faculty of Civil Law]]''' was the first secular faculty, and hence the oldest law school in the Philippines.

=== Singapore ===
In Singapore, the primary route for obtaining a legal education to qualify as a practicing lawyer is via a 4-year Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree from either the [[National University of Singapore Faculty of Law]], or the [[Singapore Management University School of Law]]. A third law school affiliated to the [[Singapore University of Social Sciences]] will commence its first intake in 2017, aimed primarily at producing law graduates focused on family, criminal and community justice law, as there is a pressing need for lawyers practicing in these areas.

Additionally, the SMU School of Law offers the 3-year [[Juris Doctor]] degree for aspiring candidates who have already completed a prior undergraduate course of study and who have been award a bachelor's degree in another field. The SMU J.D. is recognised for qualification to the Singapore Bar.

There are several private law schools in Singapore that are run by private education providers and which also award the Bachelor of Laws degree. These private law schools are neither recognised nor supported by the government and their graduates are, in the vast majority of cases, ineligible for qualification to the [[Admission to practice law#Singapore|Singapore Bar]].

===Sri Lanka===
In [[Sri Lanka]] to practice law, one must be admitted and enrolled as an [[Attorneys in Sri Lanka|Attorney-at-Law]] of the [[Supreme Court of Sri Lanka]]. This is achieved by passing law exams at the [[Sri Lanka Law College]], which are administered by the Council of Legal Education and spending a period of six months under a practicing attorney of at least 8 years standing. To undertake law exams students must gain admission to the Sri Lanka Law College and study law or directly undertake exams after gaining a [[LL.B.]] from a local or foreign university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/Law%20college/SRI%20LANKA%20LAW%20COLLEGE.htm#Admission%20to%20the%20profession|title=SRI LANKA LAW COLLEGE|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829230440/http://www.justiceministry.gov.lk/Law%20college/SRI%20LANKA%20LAW%20COLLEGE.htm#Admission%20to%20the%20profession|archivedate=2010-08-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taiwan===
{{Main|List of law schools in Taiwan}}

In Taiwan, law is primarily studied as an undergraduate program resulting in a Bachelor of Law (B.L.).&lt;ref name="Lo"&gt;Chang-fa Lo, ''Driving an Ox Cart to Catch Up With the Space Shuttle: The Need For and Prospects of Legal Education Reform in Taiwan'', 24 Wis. Int'l L.J. 41 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  Students receive academic rather than practical training.&lt;ref name="Lo" /&gt;  Practical training is arranged after the individual passes the lawyer, judge, or prosecutor exams.

A degree in law (bachelor, master or doctor) is a pre-requisite for Taiwan's bar examination. According to Ministry of Examination figures, the pass rate for the 2011 exam was 10.6%.  Since the bar exam is conducted in Chinese, a native level of language fluency is expected.

A non-citizen may take the Attorney Qualification Examination.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=I0020006|title=Laws &amp; Regulations Database and The Republic of China|website=law.moj.gov.tw}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Articles 5 and 20 of the Regulations on Attorney Qualification Examination (Bar Exam), non-citizens are allowed to participate in the bar examination with a degree in law earned in Taiwan.  Non-citizens are not allowed to sit in the prosecutor or judge examinations unless they are naturalized citizens of Taiwan.  Once a non-citizen is approved to practice law in Taiwan, he or she must abide by all statutes related to the legal practice, Codes of Legal Ethics, and the Articles of Incorporation of the Bar Association to which they are members.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

An unpublished table produced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that unemployment rates among experienced lawyers are lower than those for most high-income occupations.&lt;ref name="Tableau"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/gallery/who039s-got-biggest-salary|title=Who's Got the Biggest Salary?|date=30 July 2012|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006095404/http://www.tableausoftware.com/public/gallery/who039s-got-biggest-salary|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BLS data also suggests that lawyer employment has grown slightly faster than other occupations, with lawyers comprising a growing share of the work force over the last decade.
 
However, not all recent law graduates work as lawyers.  According to Simkovic and McIntyre's study of U.S. Census Bureau data, around 40 percent of U.S. residents with law degrees do not practice law.&lt;ref name="Simk. Mc. Study" /&gt;   Law graduates are disproportionately represented in leadership positions in business and government.&lt;ref name="Simk. Mc. Study" /&gt; The National Association for Legal Career Professionals produces an annual report summarizing the employment of recent graduates of U.S. law schools at a single point in time, 9 months of graduation.  Employment at that point is typically around 90 percent, although from 2009 to 2011, the numbers have been lower, at around 86 to 88 percent.&lt;ref name="NALP Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nalp.org/0712research|title=NALP - National Association for Law Placement - Class of 2011 Has Lowest Employment Rate Since Class of 1994|website=www.nalp.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413114301/http://www.nalp.org/0712research|archivedate=2015-04-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Approximately 2 percent of graduates were employed in non-professional jobs.&lt;ref name="NALP Statistics"/&gt;  Approximately 75 to 85 percent work in jobs classified by NALP as "JD required" or "JD preferred", and another 5 percent work in other professional jobs.&lt;ref name="NALP Statistics"/&gt;  However, a law degree increases earnings, even including those who do not practice law.&lt;ref name="Simk. Mc. Study" /&gt;

==Postgraduate and professional study==
Some schools offer a [[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.) program as a way of specializing in a particular area of law. A further possible degree is the academic [[Doctorate|doctoral degree]] in law of [[Doctor of Laws|Doctor of Juridical Science]] (S.J.D.) (in the U.S or Canada)., or the Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) in Canada or the UK, or the Ph.D. in Law from European or Australasian universities.

In addition to attending law school, many jurisdictions require law school graduates to pass a state or provincial [[bar examination]] before they may practice law. The [[Multistate Bar Examination]] is part of the bar examination in almost all United States jurisdictions. Generally, the standardized, [[common law]] subject matter of the MBE is combined with state-specific [[Essay#Academic essays|essay questions]] to produce a comprehensive bar examination.

In other common law countries the bar exam is often replaced by a period of work with a law firm known as articles of clerkship.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

== Alternative legal education systems ==

===UK and Europe===
While law schools in the U.S. and Canada are typically [[Postgraduate education|post-graduate]] institutions with considerable autonomy, legal education in other countries is provided within the mainstream educational system from university level and/or in non-degree conferring vocational training institutions.

In countries such as the United Kingdom and most of continental Europe, academic legal education is provided within the mainstream university system starting at the [[undergraduate]] level, and the legal departments of universities are simply departments like any other rather than separate "law schools". In these countries, the term "law school" may be used, but it does not have the same definition as it does in North America. The same is true for private Law Schools, e.g. in Germany two private law schools have been established, [[Bucerius Law School]] in Hamburg and EBS Law School in Wiesbaden which are termed law schools but follow the usual German path of legal education.

There are also sometimes legal colleges that provide vocational training as a post-academic stage of legal education. One example is the [[The University of Law|University of Law]] in the United Kingdom, which provides certain professional qualifications  lawyers in England and Wales must obtain before they may practice as solicitors or barristers.

===Australia===
In Australia, law schools such as the [[Melbourne Law School]], the [[Adelaide Law School]], and the [[Sydney Law School]] have emphasised a combination of the British and American systems. However, other universities such as the University of New South Wales, the Australian National University and Monash University are known for their practical work.&lt;ref&gt;For a discussion on the practical training in Australian law schools see Margaret Castles and Anne Hewitt 'Can a law school help develop skilled legal professionals' (2011) ALTERNATIVE LAW JOURNAL; 36 (2) 2011: 90–95. {{cite web |url=http://www.altlj.org/publications/current-issue/product/17-can-a-law-school-help-develop-skilled-legal-professionals-situational-learning-to-the-rescue |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119082656/http://www.altlj.org/publications/current-issue/product/17-can-a-law-school-help-develop-skilled-legal-professionals-situational-learning-to-the-rescue |archivedate=2012-01-19 |df= }}{{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Citation style|date=January 2010}}

'''Micrography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]], literally small-writing – "Μικρογραφία"), also called '''microcalligraphy''', is a [[Jew]]ish form of [[calligram]]s developed in the 9th century, with parallels in Christianity and Islam,&lt;ref&gt;[http://expositions.bnf.fr/parole/grand/134.htm Torah, Bible, Coran] (French)&lt;/ref&gt; utilizing minute [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew letters]] to form representational, geometric and abstract designs. Colored micrography is especially distinctive because these rare artworks are customarily rendered in black and white.

== Description ==
The artwork is created from text that forms an image when viewed at a distance, creating an interplay between the text and image. The [[photomosaic]], whose tiny individual images form a mosaic when viewed from a distance, is a modern analogue.

== Motivation ==
{{see also|Calligram}}
[[File:Caligrafia arabe pajaro.jpg|thumb|An Arabic [[calligram]] in the form of a peacock.]]
There is a relationship between this form of art, employing both digital and analogic symbols, and the restrictions on images found in the [[Ten commandments#Traditional division and interpretation|second commandment]]. Micrography provides a unique solution to the visual artist who wishes to remain devout in observation of [[Jewish law]], by using only text, not images per se. As similar restrictions exist in certain [[Islam|Muslim]] societies, this solution has been adapted in [[Islamic calligraphy]] to the [[Arabic alphabet]] as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11280">'''Microspherulites''' are microscopic spherical particles with diameter less than two&amp;nbsp;mm, usually in the 100 micrometre range, mainly consisting of mineral material (the Greek ''litos'' means "stone"). Only bodies created by natural physico-chemical processes, with no contribution of either biological (in [[aqueous]] [[depositional environment|sedimentary environments]] this contribution is possible) or human activity, are considered to be microspherulites.
Generally speaking, the common feature ([[sphericity]]) indicates that each sphere represents an internal equilibrium of forces within a fluid medium (water, air).

==Classification==

Several types of these forms are found in nature. Depending on the formational environment, microspherulites can be classed as [[oolite]]s, [[micrometeorite]]s, impact spherulites, [[iberulite]]s, [[pisolite]]s, [[Meteorite|aerolites]], [[chondrule]]s, [[biolite]]s, pellets, bubbles, or carbonaceous microspherules.

===Aqueous environment===
[[File:Detailed group of oolites.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Figure 1: Oolites observed with a transmitted light microscope.]]

* Oolites are internally structured spheres, composed mainly by [[calcium carbonate]] (Figure 1).  They are a type of constituent in [[limestone]]. The size of these [[ooid]]s ranges between 0.25 and 2&amp;nbsp;mm. The name derives from the Greek ''ooion'' (egg). They are formed by growing larger and accreting material as they move around. They accomplish this either (a) by physical attachment of [[Granularity|fine-grained]] material as they roll around, much in the manner of a snowball, and (b) by the [[Precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]] of material in solution, much as salt crystallizes from water during evaporation. In the former case they have thin concentric layers, and in the latter they have radiating sprays of crystals. However, a combination of both processes can be found. Microbes could contribute to their development.

===Aerial environment===

* Micrometeorites are typically metallic microspherules (iron or iron and nickel) but can also be formed by [[silicate minerals]], whose dimensions must range from tens of micrometres to one millimetre. They correspond to pieces of extraterrestrial [[meteoroids]], resulting from melting and vaporization during entry into the [[Earth's atmosphere|Earth’s atmosphere]]. During this melt stage a significant loss of mass can occur through holes in their surface. The degree of heating and their original composition determine that only a few minerals have been founded in micrometeorites. They have not yet been properly classified.
* Impact spherulites occur when a large extraterrestrial object strikes Earth at cosmic velocity, melts and vaporizes, silicate materials can condense into high spheroidal, sand-sized particles deposited around the point of impact. Unaltered impact spherulites consist entirely of glass ([[Tektite|microtektites]]) or a combination of glass and crystals grown in flight (microkrystites). Primary crystals are only common in microspherulites from two [[Phanerozoic]] impact layers: the Upper Eocene microkrystite or [[clinopyroxene]] spherule layer &lt;ref name="vr1"&gt;Glass, B.P., Burns, C.A., Crosbie, J.R., DuBois, D.L., 1985. Late Eocene North American Microtektites and Clinopyroxene-Bearing Spherules, Proceedings of the Sixteenth Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. Part 1. [[Journal of Geophysical Research]] 90, D 175-D 196.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary]] (K/T boundary) layer.&lt;ref name="vr2"&gt;Smit, J., 1999: The global stratigraphy of the. Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary impact ejecta. Annu. Rev. Earth Planetary Science, 27: 75-113. [http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/action/doSearch?action=runSearch&amp;type=advanced&amp;result=true&amp;prevSearch=%2Bauthorsfield%3A(Smit%2C+J.)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other crystalline phases may be [[olivine]], ''Fe-rich pyroxene'', [[spinel]]s and [[feldspar]]s. Frequently the crystals are replaced by [[Diagenesis|diagenetic]] phases such as [[goethite]], [[pyrite]], [[glauconite]], ''[[K-feldspar]]s'', [[quartz]], [[sericite]], [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], and ''carbonates''.

[[File:Group of iberulites.jpg|thumb|350px|Figure 2: Group of iberulites observed under Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The arrows show vortex position.]]
* [[Iberulite]]s are ''co-associations'' of well-defined minerals, together with non-crystalline compounds, with axial geometry and a characteristic depression (vortex), structured around a coarse-grained core with a [[Clay minerals|smectite]]  rind, and pinkish colour (Figure 2). They are formed at present in the [[troposphere]] by complex [[aerosol]]-water-gas interactions. The modal size is in the 60-90 micrometre range, and the shapes are almost perfect spheres. Their name comes from the [[Iberian Peninsula]], indicating the place where they were discovered.&lt;ref name="vr3"&gt;Díaz-Hernández, J.L., 2000. Aportaciones sólidas a la atmósfera originadas por un incendio forestal en el ámbito mediterráneo. Estudios Geológicos 56, 153–161. [http://estudiosgeol.revistas.csic.es/index.php/estudiosgeol/article/viewFile/147/146]&lt;/ref&gt;  They are related to intrusions of aerosol plumes from the [[Sahara desert]]. The mineralogy of the core (tens of micrometres thick) is commonly formed by [[quartz]], [[calcite]], [[dolomite]]  and [[feldspar]]s, while the most frequent minerals of the rind (a few micrometres thick) are [[clay minerals]], mainly smectites (beidellite, [[montmorillonite]]) and [[illite]], amorphous [[Silicon dioxide|silica]]  and impregnation of [[sulfate minerals]]   (mainly [[gypsum]], [[alunite]] and [[jarosite]]) and [[halide minerals|chlorides]].&lt;ref name="vr4"&gt;Díaz-Hernández, J.L., Párraga, 2008.

==Other related terms==

* Pisolites are spheroidal particles, larger in size and commonly more distorted than ooids. The name derives from the Greek ''pisos'' (pea). Mineral concentrations ([[bauxite]]s, [[limonite]]s, [[siderite]]s) and the pedogenic [[Caliche (mineral)|caliches]] (subaerial environment) can have pisolitic structure. They usually reach 5–8&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and for this reason they can not strictly be considered microspherulites. Dunham (1969) &lt;ref name="vr5"&gt;Dunham, R.J., 1969. Vadose pisolites in the Capitan Reefs (Permian) New Mexico and Texas, in Depositional Environments in carbonate rocks: Soc. Econ. Palaeontologists and Mineralogists Spec. Publ. 14, 182-191.&lt;/ref&gt;  considered them associated to caliches, while Pray and Esteban (1977) &lt;ref name="vr6"&gt;Esteban, M., Pray, L.C., 1977. Origin of the pisolite facies of the shelf crest. In: Upper Guadalupian facies Permian Reef complex, Guadalupe Mountains, New Mexico and West Texas. 1977 Field Conference Guidebook. Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists, Permian Basin Section, Publication 77-16: 479-483.
[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/gumo/1993_26/bibliography.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; suggested they were formed by inorganic precipitation from [[brine]]s.

* Aerolite is a generic term indicating lithogenic elements gathered from the atmosphere. This term does not imply sphericity or microscopic size.
* Chondrules are the microscopic constituents of [[chondrite]]s that represent 80% of the [[meteorite]]s that fall to the Earth per the   [[Meteoritical Society]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}. Chondrules range in diameter from a few micrometres to over 1&amp;nbsp;cm. They are formed by rapid heating of solid precursor material and subsequent melting, followed by slow cooling. Their main composition is silicate minerals such as olivine and [[pyroxene]], surrounded by feldspars (crystalline or glassy); minor minerals are ''Fe-sulfide'', metallic Fe-Ni and [[oxide]]s.
* Biolites are biologically produced, many organisms can produce mineral particles dubbed in general biolites. Their shape, size and composition may be very varied. As examples we can cite [[otolith|otolites]] (compounds of the [[vestibular system]] of the [[inner ear]]) and the calculi resulting from various [[histopathology|histopathologies]]. Studies have confirmed that microorganisms are able to precipitate minerals.&lt;ref name="vr7"&gt;Verrecchia, E.P., Freytet, P., Verrecchia, K.E., Dumont, J.L., 1995. Spherulites in calcrete laminar crusts: biogenic CaCO3, precipitation as a major contributor to crust formation. J. Sed. Research A65, 690–700.
[http://jsedres.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/reprint/65/4a/690?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;author1=Verrecchia&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;field_name=fulltext&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;fdate=5/1/1931&amp;tdate=10/31/2008&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Pellets are those homogeneous aggregates with no internal structure, consisting of [[Micrite|micritic calcite]], spherical to ellipsoidal in shape and with sizes between 0.03 and 0.15&amp;nbsp;mm. They are thought to be faecal particles from aquatic organisms.

[[File:Glass microspherulites.jpg|thumb|350px|Figure 3: Solid glass microspheres used like ingredients in road and street signaling paintings.]]
* Bubbles include frequently unstable spherules which may be produced by the dispersion of two immiscible fluids forming an emulsion. Usually this term is applied to air-water [[emulsion]]s, but it is also valid for water-air (hazes, drops) or other liquid fluids (oil-water).
* Carbonaceous microspherules are a type of [[soot]] particle floating in the atmosphere, produced by [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] combustion processes of fuels, and may be coated with a layer of adsorbed hydrocarbons, sulfates or both. These particles are hollow microspherules that are black in colour, and made up of carbon or [[graphite]]. The size ranges from tens to a hundred micrometres.
* Artefacts are spherules intentionally produced spherical particles for use in industry or medicine. The shape is often perfectly spherical, truly uniform and size ranging ~ 50&amp;nbsp;nm to 1000&amp;nbsp;nm ([[Nanoparticle|nanospheres]]), or 1&amp;nbsp;µm to 1000&amp;nbsp;µm ([[microsphere]]s). They may be made up of organic-inorganic compounds and provided with different properties. In fact, commercially, microspheres can be found manufactured from materials such as glass, polymers (polyethylene, polystyrene) or ceramic. Microspheres can be solid or hollow, and so their density will be very different as well as their applications. Hollow microspheres usually are added to reduce the density of a material. Solid microspheres have numerous applications depending on their size and their manufacture material. Solid glass microspheres are used in fields such as roads and streets signaling (Figure 3). They are added to paintings used for traffic signs and roadway surface signaling to incorporate the retroreflective effect. So they improve the night visibility of the way.

Misattribution is one of many [[theories of humor]] that describes an audience's inability to identify exactly why they find a [[joke]] to be [[funny]].  The formal theory is attributed to Zillmann &amp; Bryant (1980) in their article, "Misattribution Theory of Tendentious Humor", published in ''[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]]''.  They derived the critical concepts of the theory from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ''[[Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious]]'', originally published in 1905.  Freud declared people incapable of knowing exactly what it is they find amusing due to the complex nature of their [[conscious]] and [[subconscious]] minds.  Jokes are crafted by comedians who have experience with causing laughter but who may themselves be blind to the actual cause of humor.

==Tendentious vs. innocuous humor==
Freud made a key distinction between tendentious and non-tendentious humor.  Tendentious humor involves a "victim", someone at whose expense we laugh.  Non-tendentious humor does not require a victim.  This innocuous humor typically depends on wordplay, and Freud believed it has only modest power to evoke amusement.  Tendentious humor, then, is the only kind that can evoke big laughs.
However, Freud believed a mixture of both tendentious and non-tendentious humor is required to keep the tendentious humor from becoming too offensive or demeaning to its victim.  The innocent jokework of the innocuous humor would mask the otherwise hostile joke and therefore "bribe" our senses, allowing us to laugh at what would otherwise be socially unacceptable.  Therefore, we often think we are laughing at innocuous jokes, but what really makes them funny is their socially unacceptable nature hidden below the surface.

==Empirical study==
To further examine Freud's concepts, [[media scholar]]s Dolf Zillmann &amp; Jennings Bryant set up an experimental situation to combine and/or separate tendentious and non-tendentious humor.  Their findings confirmed the expectations that amusement was highest when all of the ingredients of good comedy were present.  In conjunction with disposition theory of mirth (Zillmann &amp; Cantor, 1976), audiences predictably enjoyed witnessing the demise of a disliked character.  However, the mere presence of the innocuous humor cue more than doubled the amusement in response to the observed misfortune.
The applications to humor in film, television, and other media are quite apparent.  However, very little research has been conducted to follow up Zillmann &amp; Bryant's original experiment.

==Example in today's comedy==
Sitcom and [[comedy films]] are filled with humor based on misattribution.  For example, characters in a working-class family may banter back and forth about paying bills or finding a more respected or higher-paying job.  The delivery of dialog may come across as funny for an audience who believes the humor comes from the antagonistic relationship between the two characters.  But the real hostile nature of the joke involves class and economic issues that are otherwise not funny.
Similar analysis can be applied to issues involving racial discrimination, sexual deviancy, drug abuse, and other controversial issues.

The [[Mowag]] 4x4  armored dummy is a target practice vehicle used by the armed forces of [[Switzerland]].

==History ==

Originally designed as an armored reconnaissance vehicle, the armored tank dummy is based on a [[Mowag T1 4x4]] chassis. Used as a moving target for the armor ''Wurfgranate'' (exercise) as well as for practice shells of [[rocket tube 80 | rocket tube]] (20mm insert operation) and the  [[SIG SG 510]] assault rifle  and practice with hand grenades. 240 units were built and used by the Swiss army from 1954 to 1987.

. The vehicle with the number M+83124 is now in the ''[[Schweizerisches Militärmuseum Full]]''.&lt;ref name="jaa87 Militärmuseum Full Switzerland"&gt;Militärmuseum Full Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Multimedia'''  is [[content (media)|content]] that uses a combination of different [[content format|content forms]] such as text, audio, images, animations, video and [[interactive]] content. Multimedia contrasts with [[Media (communication)|media]] that use only rudimentary computer displays such as text-only or traditional forms of printed or hand-produced material.

Multimedia can be recorded and played, displayed, interacted with or accessed by [[information]] content processing devices, such as computerized and electronic devices, but can also be part of a live performance.  Multimedia devices are [[electronic media]] devices used to store and experience multimedia content. Multimedia is distinguished from [[mixed media]] in [[fine art]]; for example, by including audio it has a broader scope. In the early years of multimedia the term "rich media" was synonymous with [[interactive media|interactive multimedia]], and "hypermedia" was an application of multimedia.

== Terminology ==
The term ''multimedia'' was coined by singer and artist Bob Goldstein (later '[[Bobb Goldsteinn]]') to promote the July 1966 opening of his "LightWorks at L'Oursin" show at [[Southampton]], Long Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Badii|first=Atta|last2=Fuschi|first2=David|last3=Khan|first3=Ali|last4=Adetoye|first4=Adedayo|date=2009-11-09|title=Accessibility-by-Design: A Framework for Delivery-Context-Aware Personalised Media Content Re-purposing|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-10308-7_14|journal=HCI and Usability for e-Inclusion|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|language=en|publisher=Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg|pages=209–226|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-10308-7_14|isbn=9783642103070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein was perhaps aware of an American artist named Dick Higgins, who had two years previously discussed a new approach to art-making he called "intermedia".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.switched.com/2010/06/03/tech-art-history-part-2/|title=Tech Art History, Part| author= Matthew Zuras| publisher= Switched| date=June 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 10, 1966, Richard Albarino of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' borrowed the terminology, reporting: "Brainchild of songscribe-comic Bob ('[[Washington Square (composition)|Washington Square]]') Goldstein, the 'Lightworks' is the latest ''multi-media'' music-cum-visuals to debut as discothèque fare."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Albarino, "Goldstein's LightWorks at Southhampton," ''Variety'', August 10, 1966. Vol. 213, No. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later, in 1968, the term "multimedia" was re-appropriated to describe the work of a political consultant, David Sawyer, the husband of Iris Sawyer—one of Goldstein's producers at L'Oursin.

[[File:Ford Show 1987.jpg|thumb|left|Multimedia (multi-image) setup for the 1988 Ford New Car Announcement Show, August 1987, Detroit, MI]] In the intervening forty years, the word has taken on different meanings. In the late 1970s, the term referred to presentations consisting of [[Multi-Image|multi-projector slide shows]] timed to an audio track. However, by the 1990s 'multimedia' took on its current meaning.

In the 1993 first edition of ''Multimedia: Making It Work'', Tay Vaughan declared "Multimedia is any combination of text, graphic art, sound, animation, and video that is delivered by computer. When you allow the user – the viewer of the project – to control what and when these elements are delivered, it is ''interactive multimedia''. When you provide a structure of linked elements through which the user can navigate, interactive multimedia becomes ''hypermedia''."&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, Tay, 1993, Multimedia: Making It Work (first edition, {{ISBN|0-07-881869-9}}), Osborne/McGraw-Hill, Berkeley, pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German language society [[Gesellschaft für deutsche Sprache]] recognized the word's significance and ubiquitousness in the 1990s by awarding it the title of [[Word of the year (Germany)|German 'Word of the Year']] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowTopicAlbumBackground/a23795/l23/l0/F.html#featuredEntry ''Ein Jahr, ein (Un-)Wort!''] (in German) [[Spiegel Online]]&lt;/ref&gt; The institute summed up its rationale by stating "[Multimedia] has become a central word in the wonderful new media world".&lt;ref&gt;''Variety'', January 1–7, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage, ''multimedia'' refers to an electronically delivered combination of media including video, still images, audio, and text in such a way that can be accessed interactively. Much of the content on the web today falls within this definition as understood by millions. Some computers which were marketed in the 1990s were called "multimedia" computers because they incorporated a CD-ROM drive, which allowed for the delivery of several hundred megabytes of video, picture, and audio data. That era saw also a boost in the production of [[education software|educational]] multimedia [[CD-ROM]]s.

The term "video", if not used exclusively to describe motion photography, is ambiguous in multimedia terminology. ''[[Video]]'' is often used to describe the file format, delivery format, or presentation format instead of ''"[[footage]]"''  which is used to distinguish motion [[photography]] from ''"[[animation]]"'' of [[Artistic rendering|rendered]] motion imagery. Multiple forms of information content are often not considered modern forms of presentation such as audio or video. Likewise, single forms of information content with single methods of information processing (e.g. non-interactive audio) are often called multimedia, perhaps to distinguish [[:wiktionary:static|static]] media from [[:wiktionary:active|active]] media. In the [[fine arts]], for example, [[Leda Luss Luyken]]'s [[ModulArt]] brings two key elements of musical composition and film into the world of painting: variation of a theme and movement of and within a picture, making ''ModulArt'' an [[interactive]] multimedia form of art. [[Performing arts]] may also be considered multimedia considering that performers and [[theatrical property|props]] are multiple forms of both content and media.

== Major characteristics ==
'''Multimedia presentations''' may be viewed by person on [[Stage (theatre)|stage]], [[Image projector|projected]], [[transmitted]], or played locally with a [[Media player (application software)|media player]].  A broadcast may be a live or recorded multimedia presentation. Broadcasts and recordings can be either [[Analogue electronics|analog]] or [[Digital circuit|digital]] electronic media technology. Digital [[online]] multimedia may be downloaded or [[Streaming media|streamed]]. Streaming multimedia may be live or on-demand.

'''Multimedia games and simulations''' may be used in a physical environment with special effects, with multiple users in an online [[Computer networking|network]], or locally with an offline computer, [[game console|game system]], or [[simulator]].

The various formats of technological or digital multimedia may be intended to enhance the users' experience, for example to make it easier and faster to convey information. Or in entertainment or art, to transcend everyday experience.

[[File:Classical spectacular laser effects.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A [[Laser lighting display|lasershow]] is a live multimedia performance.]]
Enhanced levels of interactivity are made possible by combining multiple forms of media content. [[Online]] multimedia is increasingly becoming object-oriented and data-driven, enabling applications with [[Collaborative software|collaborative]] [[User innovation|end-user innovation]] and [[personalized|personalization]] on multiple forms of content over time.  Examples of these range from multiple forms of content on Web sites like photo galleries with both images (pictures) and title (text) user-updated, to simulations whose co-efficients, events, illustrations, animations or videos are modifiable, allowing the multimedia "experience" to be altered without reprogramming. In addition to seeing and hearing, [[haptic technology]] enables virtual objects to be felt. Emerging technology involving illusions of [[taste]] and [[odor|smell]] may also enhance the multimedia experience.

== Categorization ==
Multimedia may be broadly divided into '''linear''' and '''non-linear''' categories:
*Linear active content progresses often without any navigational control for the viewer such as a [[movie theater|cinema presentation]];
*Non-linear uses [[interactivity]] to control progress as with a [[video game]] or self-paced [[computer-based training]]. [[Hypermedia]] is an example of non-linear content.

Multimedia [[presentation]]s can be '''live''' or '''recorded''':
*A recorded presentation may allow interactivity via a [[Spatial navigation|navigation system]];
*A live multimedia presentation may allow interactivity via an interaction with the presenter or performer.

== Usage/application ==
[[File:Steven Koonin BP 2005-02-22.jpg|thumb|right|A presentation using [[Microsoft PowerPoint|Powerpoint]]. Corporate presentations may combine all forms of media content.]]
Multimedia finds its application in various areas including, but not limited to, [[Advertising|advertisements]], [[art]], [[education]], [[entertainment]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[mathematics]], [[business]], scientific [[research]] and [[Visual thinking|spatial temporal applications]]. Several examples are as follows:

=== Creative industries ===
[[Creative industries]] use multimedia for a variety of purposes ranging from fine arts, to entertainment, to commercial art, to [[journalism]], to media and software services provided for any of the industries listed below. An individual multimedia designer may cover the spectrum throughout their career. Request for their skills range from technical, to analytical, to creative.

==== Commercial uses ====
Much of the electronic [[old media|old]] and [[new media]] used by commercial artists and graphic designers is multimedia. Exciting presentations are used to grab and keep attention in [[advertising]]. Business to business, and interoffice communications are often developed by [[creative services]] firms for advanced multimedia presentations beyond simple slide shows to sell ideas or liven up training. Commercial multimedia developers may be hired to design for [[governmental services]] and [[Nonprofit|nonprofit services]] applications as well.

==== Entertainment and fine arts ====
Multimedia is heavily used in the entertainment industry, especially to develop [[special effect]]s in movies and animations (VFX, 3D animation, etc.). Multimedia games are a popular pastime and are software programs available either as CD-ROMs or online. Some [[video game]]s also use multimedia features.
Multimedia applications that allow users to actively participate instead of just sitting by as passive recipients of information are called ''interactive multimedia''.
In the [[arts]] there are [[multimedia art]]ists, whose minds are able to blend techniques using different media that in some way incorporates interaction with the viewer. One of the most relevant could be [[Peter Greenaway]] who is melding [[Film|cinema]] with [[opera]] and all sorts of digital media. Another approach entails the creation of multimedia that can be displayed in a traditional fine arts arena, such as an [[art gallery]]. Although multimedia display material may be volatile, the survivability of the content is as strong as any traditional media. Digital recording material may be just as durable and infinitely reproducible with perfect copies every time.

=== Education ===
In [[education]], multimedia is used to produce [[computer-based training]] courses (popularly called CBTs) and reference books like encyclopedia and almanacs. A CBT lets the user go through a series of presentations, text about a particular topic, and associated illustrations in various information formats. [[Edutainment]] is the combination of education with entertainment, especially multimedia entertainment.

Learning theory in the past decade has expanded dramatically because of the introduction of multimedia. Several lines of research have evolved, e.g. [[cognitive load]] and [[multimedia learning]].

From multimedia learning (MML) theory, David Roberts has developed a large group lecture practice using PowerPoint and based on the use of full-slide images in conjunction with a reduction of visible text (all text can be placed in the notes view’ section of PowerPoint).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Visual feasts of the mind: matching how we teach to how we learn {{!}} David Roberts {{!}} TEDxLoughboroughU|date=2016-12-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJyhTg26w-A&amp;index=5&amp;list=PLoI1XyYg-D9WW51FPWUWLi4ZEp_mVZv5c|accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method has been applied and evaluated in 9 disciplines. In each experiment, students’ engagement and active learning has been approximately 66% greater, than with the same material being delivered using bullet points, text and speech, corroborating a range of theories presented by multimedia learning scholars like Sweller and Mayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lboro.academia.edu/DRoberts|title=David Roberts {{!}} Loughborough University - Academia.edu|website=lboro.academia.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of media convergence is also becoming a major factor in education, particularly higher education. Defined as separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications) and video that now share resources and interact with each other, media convergence is rapidly changing the curriculum in universities all over the world.

==== Educational technology ====
&lt;p&gt;Multimedia provides students with an alternate means of acquiring knowledge designed to enhance teaching and learning through various mediums and platforms. This technology allows students to learn at their own pace and gives teachers the ability to observe the individual needs of each student. The capacity for multimedia to be used in [[multi-disciplinary]] settings is structured around the idea of creating a hands-on learning environment through the use of technology &lt;ref name=":032"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Malik and Agarwal|first=S. and A.|date=October 2012|title=Use of Multimedia as a New Educational Technology
Tool–A Study|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/669a/07732895b025b68f9308560411c55040ade6.pdf|journal=International Journal of Information and Education Technology|volume=2|pages=|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Lessons can be tailored to the subject matter as well as be personalized to the students' varying levels of knowledge on the topic. Learning content can be managed through activities that utilize and take advantage of multimedia platforms&lt;ref name=":032" /&gt;. This kind of learning encourages interactive communication between students and teachers and opens feedback channels, introducing an active learning process especially with the prevalence of [[new media]] and [[social media]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andresen and Brink|first=Brent and Katja|date=2013|title=Multimedia in Education Curriculum|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002241/224187e.pdf|journal=United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organizaiton|volume=|pages=140|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Technology has impacted multimedia as it is largely associated with the use of computers or other electronic devices and [[digital media]] due to its capabilities concerning research, communication, problem-solving through simulations and feedback opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collis|first=Betty|title=Anticipating the Impact of Multimedia in Education: Lessons from the Literature|url=https://ris.utwente.nl/ws/files/6401710/K26499__.PDF|journal=Computers in Adult Education and Training|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

=== Social work ===
Multimedia is a robust education and research methodology within the social work context. The five different multimedia which supports the education process are narrative media, [[interactive media]], communicative media, adaptive media, and productive media. Contrary to long-standing belief, multimedia technology in social work education existed before the prevalence of the internet. It takes the form of images, audio, and video into the curriculum. 

First introduced to [[social work]] education by Seabury &amp; Maple in 1993, multimedia technology is utilized to teach social work practice skills including interviewing, crisis intervention, and group work. In comparison with conventional teaching method, including face-to-face courses, multimedia education shortens transportation time, increases knowledge and confidence in a richer and more authentic context for learning, generates interaction between online users, and enhances understanding of conceptual materials for novice students. 

In an attempt to examine the impact of multimedia technology on students’ study, A. Elizabeth Cauble &amp; Linda P. Thurston conducted a research in which Building Family Foundations (BFF), an interactive multimedia training platform, was utilized to assess social work students’ reactions to multimedia technology on variables of knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy. The results states that respondents show a substantial increase in academic knowledge, confidence, and attitude. Multimedia also benefits students because it brings expert to students online, fits students’ schedule, allows students to choose courses that suit them. 

Mayer’s Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning suggests, "people learn more from words and pictures than from words alone." According to Mayer and other scholars, multimedia technology stimulates people’s brains by implementing visual and auditory effects, and thereby assists online users to learn efficiently. Researchers suggest that when users establish dual channels while learning, they tend to understand and memorize better. Mixed literature of this theory are still present in the field of multimedia and social work.

=== Language communication ===
With the spread and development of the English language around the world, it has become an important way of communicating between different people and cultures. Multimedia Technology creates a platform where language can be taught. The traditional form of teaching English as a Second Language (ESL) in classrooms have drastically changed with the prevalence of technology, making easier for students to obtain language learning skills. Multimedia motivates students to learn more languages through audio, visual and animation support. It also helps create English contexts since an important aspect of learning a language is developing their grammar, vocabulary and knowledge of pragmatics and genres. In addition, cultural connections in terms of forms, contexts, meanings and ideologies have to be constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yang|first=Weiyan|last2=Fang|first2=Fan|date=November 2008|title=Optimization of Multimedia English Teaching

Revista Electrónica de Investigación Educativa|volume=17|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its effects on learning behavior. Their findings based on [[Howard Gardner|Gardner]]’s theory of the “[[Motivation in second-language learning|socio-educational model]] of learner motivation and attitudes”, the study shows that there is easier access to language learning materials as well as increased motivation with MI along with the use of [[Computer-assisted language learning|Computer-Assisted Language Learning]].

=== Journalism ===
Newspaper companies all over are trying to embrace the new phenomenon by implementing its practices in their work. While some have been slow to come around, other major newspapers like ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[USA Today]]'' and ''[[The Washington Post]]'' are setting the precedent for the positioning of the newspaper industry in a globalized world.

News reporting is not limited to traditional media outlets. Freelance journalists can make use of different new media to produce multimedia pieces for their news stories. It engages global audiences and tells stories with technology, which develops new communication techniques for both media producers and consumers. The Common Language Project, later renamed to [[The Seattle Globalist]], is an example of this type of multimedia journalism production.

Multimedia reporters who are mobile (usually driving around a community with cameras, audio and video recorders, and laptop computers) are often referred to as [[Mojo (mobile journalist)|mojos]], from ''mo''bile ''jo''urnalist.

=== Engineering ===
[[Software engineer]]s may use multimedia in [[Simulations#Computer simulators|computer simulations]] for anything from entertainment to [[training]] such as military or industrial training. Multimedia for [[Graphical user interface|software interfaces]] are often done as a collaboration between [[creative professional]]s and software engineers.

=== Mathematical and scientific research ===
In [[mathematics|mathematical]] and scientific [[research]], multimedia is mainly used for modeling and simulation. For example, a [[scientist]] can look at a [[Molecular modelling|molecular model]] of a particular substance and manipulate it to arrive at a new substance. Representative research can be found in journals such as the ''[[Journal of Multimedia]]''.

=== Medicine ===
In [[medicine]], [[Physician|doctors]] can get trained by looking at a virtual [[surgery]] or they can simulate how the [[human body]] is affected by [[disease]]s spread by [[virus]]es and [[bacterium|bacteria]] and then develop techniques to prevent it. Multimedia applications such as [[virtual surgery|virtual surgeries]] also help doctors to get practical training.

== Associations and conferences ==
In Europe, the reference organisation for the multimedia industry is the [[European Multimedia Associations Convention]] (EMMAC).

Scholarly conferences about multimedia include:
* [[ACM Multimedia]]
* [[IEEE]] International Conference on Multimedia &amp; Expo (ICME)

The [[solar eclipse]] mentioned in a text dating to the reign of [[Mursili II]] could be of great importance for the absolute chronology of the [[Hittite Empire]] within the [[chronology of the Ancient Near East]]. The text records that in the tenth year of Mursili's reign, "the Sun gave a sign" (''{{lang|hit|istanus sakiyahta}}''), just as the king was about to launch a campaign against the Kingdom of [[Azzi-Hayasa]] in north-eastern Anatolia.&lt;ref&gt;KUB XIV 4.24: [''ma-a-an I-NA'' KUR ''A'']''zi-ma i-ia-ah-at nu'' &lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt;[[Shamash|UTU]]''-us sa-ki-ya-ah-ta'' "[When] I marched [to the land of A]zzi, the Sungod gave a sign." Theo P. J. Van Den Hout, ''The Purity of Kingship: An Edition of CTH 569 and Related Hittite Oracle Inquiries of Tutẖaliya'' (1998),  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7DTPyG4VvpcC&amp;pg=PA42  42f.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reference in the annals was first interpreted as describing an eclipse by [[Emil Forrer]] (1926),&lt;ref&gt;E. Forrer,  ''Forschungen II'' 1.1 "Astronomische Festlegung des Soppiluljomas, Morsilis und Amenophis IV." (1926) KUB XIV,4 (= CTH 70).&lt;/ref&gt; Schorr (1928) identified it as the  eclipse the  of 13 March 1335 BC, visible as [[annular eclipse|annular]] in Anatolia in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;''Astronomische Abhandlungen''  8-9 (1929), p. 16. ''Mitteilungen des Instituts für Orientforschung  6 (1958), 188.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is now more commonly identified as the one of 24 June 1312, which was visible in [[total eclipse|totality]] in northern Anatolia in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce (1998){{page needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Paul Åström]] (1993) proposes the alternative date of 13 April 1308, which would have been visible as partial eclipse at sunrise. [[Peter J. Huber]] has suggested a date of 8 January 1339 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Huber, The Solar Omen of Muršili II,  Journal of the American Oriental Society, vol. 121, no. 4, pp. 640-644, (Oct. - Dec., 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==1312 eclipse==
The 1312 eclipse occurred over northern Anatolia in the early afternoon, and its effects would have been quite spectacular for Mursili and his men on campaign:
:24 June 1312 BC, total eclipse, maximum at 10:44 UTC, {{coord|38.2|N|13.7|E}} ([[Sicily]]) and lasted 2 min 48 sec, some stated as it occurred inside the [[Ionian Sea]] at 17 E.

Areas that were inside the maximum eclipse included the islands that are now Barlavento in [[Cape Verde]], the Moorish lands (comprising modern day [[Mauritania]], [[Western Sahara]], [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]]), [[Tunisia]] (then inner Africa), [[Greece]], the [[Caucasus]] region, Persia (now Iran), in the area of the present-day Iranian-Turkmeni border, present-day Afghanistan and Pakistan and a part of the north of [[India]].

The eclipse started off in modern-day [[Brazil]] in South America and finished in what is now [[Myanmar]] (also known as [[Burma]]).

The 1312 date would imply that Mursili began his reign in either 1322 or 1321 BC. This date would be roughly that usually proposed for the death of [[Tutankhamun]]. It is known that [[Suppiluliuma I]] was besieging [[Carchemish]] when he received a letter from the widow of a [[Pharaoh]] (who is called [[Dakhamunzu]] in the annals). Suppiluliuma died shortly thereafter and his successor was Mursili II (whose brother would have been Prince [[Zannanza]] sent to Egypt where he died). Thus this appears to be a chronological anchor. However, there are other views, asserting for example that the dead Pharaoh was [[Akhenaten]] or that Tutankhamun died later.

==1308 eclipse==
In contrast, the 1308 eclipse was annular, and began very early in the morning over [[Arabia]] (and only [[penumbral]] over Anatolia and Syria), reaching its height over [[Central Asia]]:
:13 April 1308 BC, annular eclipse (94.8%), maximum at 04:16 UTC, {{coord|44.9|N|85.7|E}} ([[Tian Shan]]) and lasted 4 min 40 sec.

Other areas that had inside the band of the annular eclipse included the [[Indus River|Indus Delta]] and parts of [[Siberia]] including the [[New Siberian Islands]]. The maximum eclipse ended at sunset over the [[Beaufort Sea]] along with the [[Bering Sea]] and the westernmost portion of [[Alaska]] with the west of the [[Aleutian Islands]].  The eclipse covered much of Asia except for the southwesternmost portions and the southeastern islands, one of the islands that was near the edge of the eclipse was [[Honshū]], Japan.

'''Nordic Classicism''' was a [[Architectural style|style of architecture]] that briefly blossomed in the [[Nordic countries]] ([[Sweden]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Finland]]) between 1910 and 1930.

Until a resurgence of interest for the period during the 1980s (marked by several scholarly studies and public exhibitions), Nordic Classicism was regarded as a mere interlude between two far more well-known architectural movements, [[National Romantic Style|National Romanticism]], or ''[[Jugendstil]]'' (often seen as equivalent or parallel to [[Art Nouveau]]), and [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] (aka [[Modernist architecture|Modernism]]).

== History ==
[[File:Københavns Politigård under construction.jpg|thumb|[[Copenhagen Police Headquarters]] (1924) by [[Hack Kampmann]].]]
The development of Nordic Classicism was no isolated phenomenon, but took off from [[Classical architecture|classical]] traditions already existing in the Nordic countries, and from new ideas being pursued in German-speaking cultures. Nordic Classicism can thus be characterised as a combination of direct and indirect influences from [[vernacular]] architecture (Nordic, Italian and German) and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]], but also the early stirrings of Modernism from the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] – especially their exhibition of 1914 - and by the mid-1920s the ''Esprit Nouveau'' emerging from the theories of [[Le Corbusier]].

The modernist influence went beyond mere aesthetics: [[urbanisation]] tied to modern building techniques and the introduction of regulations both in building and [[town planning]], and moreover, to the rise of social forces that resulted in a change in political ideology toward the Left, resulting in the [[Nordic welfare state]], and new programmes for public buildings such as hospitals (e.g. the [[Beckomberga Hospital]] in western [[Stockholm]] (1927-1935) by [[Carl Westman]]) and schools (e.g. the Fridhemsplan school, Stockholm, (1925–27) by Georg A. Nilsson). But while Nordic classicism was employed for a number of important public buildings, it was also applied as a model for low-cost housing (e.g. the [[Käpylä|Puu-Käpylä]] Garden Town, Helsinki (1920–25) by Martti Välikangas) and domestic architecture in general (e.g. an affordable sense of style for the nouveau-riche).

1930 is usually considered the end point of Nordic Classicism because that was the year of the [[Stockholm Exhibition (1930)|Stockholm Exhibition]], designed mostly by [[Gunnar Asplund]] and [[Sigurd Lewerentz]], when a more purist Modernism was unveiled as a model for a modern society. However, key buildings continued to be built in the classical style after that, notably Östberg's Maritime Museum in Stockholm (1931–34).

== Notable architects ==

[[File:Rathaus Haugesund.jpg|thumb|right|Haugesund City Hall (1922-1931) by [[Gudolf Blakstad]] and [[Herman Munthe-Kaas]]]]

Certain architects had reached the culmination of their careers already when the [[National Romantic style]] came, but their latter works were in the Nordic Classicism style (e.g. [[Carl Westman]]), the career of others culminated with Nordic Classicism (e.g. [[Ivar Tengbom]] and [[Ragnar Östberg]]), while others later went on to achieve far greater significance as Modernist architects (e.g. [[Arne Jacobsen]], [[Alvar Aalto]], and [[Sven Markelius]]). The two figures who achieved greatest significance in both periods, however, were Swedish architects [[Gunnar Asplund]] and [[Sigurd Lewerentz]].

'''[[Architecture of Denmark|Denmark]]''': [[Kay Fisker]], [[Hack Kampmann]], [[Kaj Gottlob]], [[Ivar Bentsen]], [[Povl Baumann]], [[Poul Holsøe]], [[Edvard Thomsen]], [[Thomas Havning]], [[Holger Jacobsen]], [[Kaare Klint]], [[Arne Jacobsen]], [[Carl Petersen (architect)|Carl Petersen]], [[Aage Rafn]], [[Steen Eiler Rasmussen]], [[Sven Risom]], and [[Frits Schlegel]].

'''[[Architecture of Finland|Finland]]''': [[Gunnar Taucher]], [[Uno Ullberg]], [[Martti Välikangas]], [[J.S. Sirén]], [[Alvar Aalto]], [[Pauli E. Blomstedt]], [[Elsi Borg]], [[Erik Bryggman]], [[Hilding Ekelund]], [[Heikki Siikonen]], and [[Oiva Kallio]].

'''[[Architecture of Norway|Norway]]''': [[Lars Backer]], [[Lorentz Ree]], [[Sverre Pedersen]], [[Nicolai Beer]], [[Finn Berner]], [[Harald Hals]], [[Herman Munthe-Kaas]], [[Gudolf Blakstad]], [[Finn Bryn]], [[Jens Dunker]] and [[Johan Ellefsen]].

'''[[Architecture of Sweden|Sweden]]''': [[Ragnar Östberg]], [[Gunnar Asplund]], [[Carl Westman]], [[Sigurd Lewerentz]], [[Carl Bergsten]], [[Sigfrid Ericson]], [[Torben Grut]], [[Ragnar Hjorth]], [[Cyrillus Johansson]], [[Erik Lallerstedt]], [[Gunnar Leche]], [[Sven Markelius]], [[Gunnar Morssing]], [[George Nilsson]], [[Ture Ryberg]], [[Albin Stark]], [[Eskil Sundahl]], [[Lars Israel Wahlman]], [[Sven Wallander]], [[Hakon Ahlberg]] and [[Ivar Tengbom]].

Though these architects are listed by country, during this period there was an intense cultural exchange among the Nordic countries (many architects worked in more than one), but also considerable development in the architect's sphere of activity, from consultant to the bourgeoisie to town planner concerned with infrastructure, dwelling and public services. As Swedish historian Henrik O. Anderson (1982: 23), has put it, this was an architecture of democracy, not radical [[avant-garde|avant-gardism]]. Furthermore, with the exception of Finland, the other Nordic countries had avoided getting involved in the [[World War I|First World War]], allowing for continued cultural development.

Interest in Nordic Classicism, especially in its most classical form, arose in the late 1970s and early 1980s at the height of [[postmodern architecture|postmodernism]] when critics, historians and architecture teachers were looking for historical precedents for the architecture of such architects as [[Michael Graves]], [[Leon Krier]] and [[Robert A. M. Stern|Robert Stern]]. Nordic classicism provided that precedent, especially with such seminal buildings as Gunnar Asplund's Scandia Cinema in Stockholm (1924), Listers District Courthouse (1917–21), Villa Snellman in [[Djursholm]] (1917–18) and [[Stockholm Public Library]] (1920-28), as well as the landscape and buildings of the [[Skogskyrkogården]] Cemetery, Stockholm (1917-1940) by both Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz.

In regards to architectural style, there were several precedents or reasons which account for the rise of Nordic Classicism. First was the existing classical tradition, borne from the architecture of [[Absolute monarchy|Absolutism]] &amp;ndash; that is, the classical architectural symbols of power of the Swedish and Danish monarchies &amp;ndash; down to the vernacular, for instance in terms of considerations for symmetry, detailing and proportion.

Throughout the 19th century there were a number of factors contributing to a more simplified classicism. The teachings of [[Jean-Nicolas-Louis Durand|J.N.L. Durand]] at the [[École Polytechnique]] of Paris at the beginning of the 19th century had attempted to rationalise the language and building techniques of classicism, while allowing for simple additive compositions. Durand's teachings spread, entering German culture in the form of Romantic Classicism with the work of [[Friedrich Gilly]] and [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]. Scholars were at the time uncovering the remnants of [[Pompeii]], and discovering the use of bright colour in Roman architecture – an aspect that had more or less been forgotten in the [[Renaissance]], but also rediscovering Greece and Egypt. These aspects were incorporated into Neoclassicism and continued into Nordic Classicism (e.g. The [[Thorvaldsen Museum]], [[Copenhagen]], 1839–48, by M.G. Bindesbøll, incorporates Egyptian motifs as does Asplund's Stockholm Public Library).

There are also 'circles of reaction' to consider. Art Nouveau and National Romanticism had little impact in Denmark, while in Sweden, Norway and Finland there were also strong National Romantic reactions. Neoclassicism had arrived in Finland via [[Saint Petersburg]] as a universal language but by the end of the 19th century came to represent an alien presence – that of [[Russia]]. Thus when stirrings of political independence appeared in Finland and  Norway, a rugged, national romantic architecture – a local variation of Art Nouveau – playing on the nationalistic myths, took hold. Nordic classicism was thus a counter-reaction to that style and eclecticism in general; a movement toward [[Universal (metaphysics)|universal]]ism, internationalism and simplification.

Many of the architects who practiced in the Nordic Classical style made pilgrimages to northern [[Italy]] to study Italian vernacular architecture. With close cultural links at that time between the Nordic countries and Germany, another important source came from German critics of Art Nouveau, in particular [[Hermann Muthesius]] – who had been a promoter of the English [[Arts and Crafts movement]] and founded the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] in 1907 - and Paul Schultze-Naumburg, as well as the latter’s student [[Heinrich Tessenow]], and [[Peter Behrens]].

In turn, the thinking in Nordic Classicism became one of the basis for the development of Modernism in the Nordic Countries. The idea that there would have been a continuity between vernacular and modernism has been seen as counter to received historical opinion about the rise of Modernism, beginning with [[Le Corbusier]] and his [[Le Corbusier#Five points of architecture|5 Points for Architecture]], which are seen as overturning 5 basic principles of Classicism. A demonstration in real time of the move from Nordic Classicism to a pure Functionalism is offered by Alvar Aalto's design for the [[Viipuri Library]] (1927–35), which went through a profound transformation from the original architectural competition proposal in 1927 (owing much to Gunnar Asplund) to the severely functionalist building, completed eight years later in a purist modernist style, influenced by Le Corbusier.

{{Paleontology}}
'''Paleoecology''' (also spelled '''palaeoecology''') is the study of interactions between organisms and/or interactions between organisms and their environments across geologic timescales. As a discipline, paleoecology interacts with, depends on and informs a variety of fields including [[paleontology]], [[ecology]], [[climatology]] and [[biology]].

Paleoecology emerged out of the field of paleontology in the 1950s, though paleontologists have conducted paleoecological studies since the creation of paleontology in the 1700s and 1800s. Combining the investigative approach of searching for fossils with the theoretical approach of [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Alexander von Humboldt]], paleoecology began as paleontologists began examining both the ancient organisms they discovered and the reconstructed environments in which they lived. Visual depictions of past marine and terrestrial communities has been considered an early form of paleoecology.

== Overview of paleoecological approaches ==

* Classic paleoecology uses data from [[fossil]]s and [[subfossil]]s to reconstruct the [[ecosystem]]s of the past. It involves the study of fossil organisms and their associated remains (such as shells, teeth, pollen, and seeds), which can help in the interpretation of their [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]], living interactions, [[natural environment]], communities, and manner of death and burial. Such interpretations aid the reconstruction of past environments (i.e., paleoenvironments). Paleoecologists have studied the [[fossil record]] to try to clarify the relationship animals have to their environment, in part to help understand the current state of [[biodiversity]]. They have identified close links between vertebrate taxonomic and ecological diversity, that is, between the diversity of animals and the [[Ecological niche|niche]]s they occupy.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2010|title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html|format=PDF|journal=Biology Letters|volume=6|issue=4|pages=544–547|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024|pmc=2936204|pmid=20106856|author=Sahney, S.,  Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical paleoecology is a primarily reductionist approach: scientists conduct detailed analysis of relatively small groups of organisms within shorter geologic timeframes.
* Evolutionary paleoecology uses data from fossils and other evidence to examine how organisms and their environments change throughout time. Evolutionary paleoecologists take the holistic approach of looking at both organism and environmental change, accounting for physical and chemical changes in the atmosphere, lithosphere and hydrosphere across time. By studying patterns of evolution and extinction in the context of environmental change, evolutionary paleoecologists are able to examine concepts of vulnerability and resilience in species and environments.
* Community paleoecology uses statistical analysis to examine the composition and distribution of groups of plants or animals. By quantifying how plants or animals are associated, community paleoecologists are able to investigate the structures of ancient communities of organisms. Advances in technology have helped propel the field, through the use of physical models and computer-based analysis.

== Major principles ==
While the functions and relationships of fossil organisms may not be observed directly (as in ecology), scientists can describe and analyze both individuals and communities over time. To do so, paleoecologists make the following assumptions:

*All organisms are adapted and restricted to a particular environment, and are usually adapted to a particular lifestyle.
*Essentially all organisms depend on another organism, whether directly or indirectly.
*The fossil or physical records are inherently incomplete - the geologic record is selective and some environments are more likely to be preserved than others. [[Taphonomy]], affecting the over- and underrepresentation of fossils, is an extremely important consideration in interpreting fossil assemblages.
*[[Uniformitarianism]] is the concept that processes that took place in the geologic past are the same as the ones that are observed taking place today. In paleoecology, uniformitarianism is used as a methodology: paleoecologists make inferences about ancient organisms and environments based on analogies they find in the present.

==Paleoecological methods==

The aim of paleoecology is to build the most detailed model possible of the [[Ecology|life environment]] of previously living organisms found today as fossils. The process of reconstructing past environments requires the use of ''archives'' (e.g., sediment sequences), ''proxies'' (e.g., the micro or mega-fossils and other sediment characteristics that provide the evidence of the biota and the physical environment), and ''chronology'' (e.g., obtaining absolute (or relative) dating of events in the archive). Such reconstruction takes into consideration complex interactions among environmental factors such as temperatures, food supplies, and degree of solar illumination. Often much of this information is lost or distorted by the fossilization process or diagenesis of the enclosing sediments, making interpretation difficult.  

Some other proxies for reconstructing past environments include charcoal and pollen, which synthesize fire and vegetation data, respectively. Both of these alternates can be found in lakes and peat settings, and can provide moderate to high resolution information &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://serc.carleton.edu/NZFires/predict_future.html|title=Paleoecology: a window into the past|website=Exploring the Past to Understand the Future|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These are well studied methods often utilized in the paleoecological field.  
 
The environmental complexity factor is normally tackled through [[statistics|statistical]] analysis of the available numerical data (quantitative [[paleontology]] or [[paleostatistics]]), while the study of post-mortem processes is known as the field of [[taphonomy]].

==Quaternary==
Much of the original paleoecological research has focused on the last two million years (the [[Quaternary]] period), because older environments are less well represented in the fossil [[timeline of evolution]]. Indeed, many studies concentrate on the [[Holocene]] epoch (the last 11,500 years), or the last glacial stage of the [[Pleistocene]] epoch (the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Wisconsin/Weichsel/Devensian/Würm glaciation]] of the [[ice age]], from 50,000 to 11,500 years ago).  Such studies are useful&lt;ref name="Charlesetal1987acidificationbigmooselake"&gt;Charles D.F.; Whitehead D. R.; Engstrom D. R.; et al. (1987) Paleoliminological evidence for recent acidification of Big Moose Lake, Adirondack Mountains, New-York (USA).

"'''Prick Up Your Ears'''" is the sixth episode of the [[Family Guy (season 5)|fifth season]] of ''[[Family Guy]]''. It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on November 19, 2006. In this episode, Lois discovers that Chris' school has removed the [[sex education]] program due to budget cuts and decides to bring the class back by becoming the teacher. Unfortunately, she gets fired a short time later for teaching the students about safe sex rather than abstinence. Meanwhile, Stewie attempts to find and kill the [[Tooth Fairy]] after being told "horror" stories by Brian.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007thh4|title=Prick Up Your Ears: Brief plot synopsis|accessdate=2007-12-14|year=2006|publisher=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was written by [[Cherry Chevapravatdumrong]] and directed by [[James Purdum]]. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 9.3 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Mindy Cohn]], [[Gary Cole]], [[Taylor Cole]], [[Lauren Conrad]], [[David Cross]], [[Margaret Easley]], Lauren Hooser, Kim Parks, [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], [[André Sogliuzzo]] and [[Crawford Wilson]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series.

==Plot==
As [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] finds [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and his friends watching a [[pornographic film]], she becomes convinced a proper [[sex education|sex-ed]] class should be taught at his school. Since the sex-ed class at her children's school was removed, Lois decides to become the school's newest sex-ed teacher. In class, she attempts to teach students about [[safe sex]], but her efforts are ruined by a botched attempt of [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], who wishes to distribute his views on sex as well. Soon after the first sex-ed class, parental protests arise as Lois taught kids about safe ways to perform [[premarital sex]], rather than [[abstinence]]. As a result, Lois is subsequently fired. She is replaced by a reverend who promotes both premarital and marital abstinence, explaining fictional consequences of intercourse with various questionable examples. The idea appeals to most students, including [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], who starts a relationship with a fellow student named Doug. In a subplot, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] loses a tooth and is told about the [[tooth fairy]]. Frightened by the fairy tale, Stewie develops a plan to capture the fairy, not knowing she does not exist. He borrows Herbert's false teeth and provokes [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]'s girlfriend Jillian to throw up, as she has [[bulimia nervosa]], in order to collect her teeth as well. Brian, overseeing Stewie's increasing obsession with the fairy, reveals to Stewie that she does not exist, but another scene shows a man named T. Fairy, having an apparent tooth [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]], stealing teeth to roll around in them.

Peter, truly believing the anti-sex propaganda Meg brings home, starts wearing a [[chastity belt]] and refuses to have sex with Lois. In her place, Lois, growing tired of the whole ordeal, convinces Peter to change his mind after raping him. At the same time, Lois catches Meg and Doug engaging in "ear sex" (which has become a fad at the school). Meg explains they did it so that it would not count as sex "in the eyes of the Lord." This prompts Lois and Peter to collaborate into sneaking into the school after being banned. Lois tells the kids that while they should not have sex until they are ready, everyone has urges and it is okay to have premarital sex, but only as long as it is practiced safely and encourages them to use condoms. Following this revelation, Meg's boyfriend breaks up with her after discovering Meg's naked appearance. Humiliated, Meg blames Lois for ruining her relationship and runs away to her room, sobbing. As Peter, Brian, and Lois wrap things up, an announcer tells viewers to text which ending should end the episode: Lois retelling her speech (FAMGUY1), Meg talking about her day (FAMGUY2), or Cleveland giving his line (FAMGUY 3). In the end, the viewers choose FAMGUY 3, and the episode ends with [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] poking out the window and saying the line "Hey Y'all! Sock it to me!".

==Production and censorship==
Many scenes from the original episode were seen as vulgar and were removed from the television broadcast.  One of the scenes removed was from the beginning of the episode when Stewie, Chris, and his friends were watching ''Genital Hospital'', a reference to the television show ''[[General Hospital]]''. The original scene had included the doctor on the film undoing his zipper after discussing the patient's health problems. The edited version cut away before the doctor could undo his zipper, but the sound can still be heard when it cuts back to Chris and his friends watching the porno.&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"&gt;{{cite video | people=MacFarlane, Seth|date=2006|title=Family Guy season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Prick Up Your Ears"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another scene edited was a naked Peter shown crouched on top of Lois's head (attempting ear sex) (even though it was shown on [[Adult Swim]] every time the episode repeats). On the TV version, Peter is still naked, but it is implied (through sound effects) that Lois forcibly pushed him to the floor and she has a hand on her ear (impling Peter attempted ear sex).&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"/&gt; In this scene, Peter refers to [[the Grimace]] as [[Ronald McDonald]]'s [[Autism|autistic]] friend, which was originally penned as "retarded friend" (and is included in the uncut version). A scene in which Brian, wearing a robe, informs Lois of the weird-tasting [[Smuckers]] jelly in the fridge leads Peter to reveal that the Smuckers was on his penis was edited on TV so that way he states that the jelly was on his crotch.&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"/&gt; In a scene added later to the episode, [[Mel Gibson]] apologizes to the Jewish community after being offensive while continuing to offend them. The scene was added after the episode had been made but prior to broadcasting. When Peter joins Meg in her quest to be abstinent, the TV version has a gag where Peter keeps mispronouncing the word, Meg corrects him, and Peter punishes her by sending her to her room. The Adult Swim and DVD version replaces that scene with one that was edited for being insensitive to Asian people in which Peter tells Meg that now that he is abstinent, he will be as untouched as the turn signal on an Asian woman's car, followed by a cutaway of an Asian lady causing an accident on an eight-lane highway. In the scene involving Stewie entering [[Herbert (Family Guy)|Herbert]]'s house, a picture of Chris with the body of a model was in the animatic, but not shown on TV.&lt;ref name="SMith"&gt;{{cite video | people=Smith, Danny|date=2006|title=Family Guy season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Prick Up Your Ears"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite video | people=Goodman, David|date=2006|title=Family Guy season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Prick Up Your Ears"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original ending of this episode (with the "choose your own ending" text message contest) was supposed to have Lois and Peter throw Brian out the window instead of giving Cleveland his one and only appearance in the episode. This deleted scene is featured in the episode animatic on the season five DVD set.

In addition to the regular cast, actors [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Mindy Cohn]], [[Gary Cole]], [[Taylor Cole]], [[Lauren Conrad]], [[David Cross]], [[Margaret Easley]], Lauren Hooser, Kim Parks, [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], [[André Sogliuzzo]] and [[Crawford Wilson]] guest star in the episode. Recurring guest voices include [[Lori Alan]], [[Alexandra Breckenridge|Alex Breckenridge]], [[Steve Callaghan]], Chris Cox, [[Ralph Garman]], [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], [[Alec Sulkin]], [[John Viener]], and [[Adam West]], who has a role of an exaggerated version of himself.

==Cultural references==
As Lois is informed the sex education classes will be terminated, she exclaims "Oh, no!", a cut-a-way scene then begins of a [[sports car]] driving along the road with music playing in the background, this is a reference to ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt; When Stewie is using his toys in order to capture and kill the tooth fairy, the toys are SpongeBob from ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] (from ''[[Transformers (fiction)|The Transformers]]'') and [[Man-E-Faces]], all of which are fictional characters for television programs.&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"/&gt; When Peter is watching television, he is watching ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County]]''; the women shown on the episode are actually cartoon animations of the real actors for the show.&lt;ref name="Makkos"&gt;{{cite video | people=Makkos, Suzanna|date=2006|title=Family Guy season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Prick Up Your Ears"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Lois catches Chris and his friends watching a pornographic film, she tells them that without sex education, they can easily become sexually confused.  The scene cuts to [[Michael Jackson]] in his childhood form eating a bowl of [[Frosted Mini-Wheats]], saying that he likes the frosted side, while the grown-up in him likes his younger self. When Lois teaches a sex education class, Peter uses a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of [[William Shakespeare]] and a [[Rainbow Brite]] doll to demonstrate [[sexual intercourse]]. In the scene where Stewie loses a tooth, everybody comes in and tells him to calm down, then it shows a long line of characters, mimicking a scene from the movie ''[[Airplane!]]''. While doing a news story on ear sex, Diane tells Tom that ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' is on Thursdays. When Brian talks about Jillian's [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]], he mentions the death of singer [[Karen Carpenter]], who died from anorexia in 1983. When Stewie thinks that Brian is the Tooth Fairy, Brian substantiates his identity by telling Stewie he has a picture of [[Chris Noth]] in his wallet, known for his role on ''[[Law &amp; Order]]''.

==Reception==
In a slight improvement over the previous week, the episode was viewed in 9.3 million homes in its original airing, according to [[Nielsen ratings]]. The episode also acquired a 3.3 rating in the 18–49 demographic, tying with ''[[The Simpsons]]'', while still winning over ''[[American Dad!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=111406_09 |title=Weekly Program Rankings |publisher=ABC Medianet |date=2006-11-14 |accessdate=2010-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221062706/http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=111406_09 |archivedate=2009-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the episode received little positive reception, it was given a positive review by ''[[IGN]]''{{'}}s Dan Iverson, who noted that its plot had "great satire of the issue of sex education vs. abstinence".&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/746/746822p1.html|title=Family Guy: "Prick Up Your Ears" Review|work=[[IGN]]|author=Iverson, Dan|accessdate=2007-12-14|date=November 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that "the random flashback jokes are often what are most memorable about each episode".&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; He gave the episode a rating of 7.8 out of 10.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; In his review of ''Family Guy'', volume 5, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk called the episode "a smart jab at the conservative Christian approach to sex education", and stated that "the effect it has on Meg, as well as Peter, is great".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/30387/family-guy-volume-5/|title=Family Guy, Volume 5|work=DVD Talk|author=Rizzo, Francis III|date=September 18, 2007|accessdate=2010-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

During [[World War II]] the [[United States Office of War Information]] (OWI) launched a large-scale information and propaganda campaign both at home and abroad through radio broadcasts, newspapers, posters, photographs, films and other forms of media, but ''psychological warfare'' operations had been run by special military units.

After the end of the war President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] transferred the operations of the OWI as well as control over [[Voice of America]] overseas radio network to the Interim International Information Service (IIS) within the State Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Needell|first=Allan|title=Science, Cold War and the American State|url={{Google books|mMDSO8Ci42cC|page=156|plainurl=yes}}|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; The State Department, eager to assert leadership in this area, organized a civilian-sponsored project on new methods and approaches to [[Cold War]] propaganda, code-named Project Troy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Needell|first=Allan|title=Science, Cold War and the American State|url={{Google books|mMDSO8Ci42cC|page=155|plainurl=yes}}|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convened in October 1950 at the State Department's request, it brought together for a period of almost three months a group of twenty-one distinguished scientists, social scientists, and historians, most of whom were academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/dh/article-abstract/17/3/399/392265/Truth-Is-Our-Weapon-Project-TROY-Political-Warfare|title="Truth Is Our Weapon": Project TROY, Political Warfare, and Government-Academic Relations in the National Security State|date=1 June 2007|first=Allan|last=Needell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be assumed that the Truman administration tried to implement plans established by the Project Troy in the project ''Overload and Delay''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitrovich|first=Gregory|title=Undermining the Kremlin: America's Strategy to Subvert the Soviet Bloc, 1947–1956|url={{Google books|w6TVdT-q7vcC|page=77|plainurl=yes}}|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the latter was to break the [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] system by increasing the number of input points in the system and by creating complex and unpredictable situations requiring action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitrovich|first=Gregory|title=Undermining the Kremlin: America's Strategy to Subvert the Soviet Bloc, 1947–1956|url={{Google books|w6TVdT-q7vcC|page=76|plainurl=yes}}|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{linguistics}}
'''Prototype theory''' is a mode of graded [[categorization]] in [[cognitive science]], where some members of a category are more central than others.  For example, when asked to give an example of the concept ''furniture'', ''chair'' is more frequently cited than, say, ''stool''. Prototype theory has also been applied in [[linguistics]], as part of the mapping from [[phonology|phonological structure]] to [[semantics]].

==Overview==
As formulated in the 1970s by [[Eleanor Rosch]] and others{{Citation needed|reason=Which others?|date=August 2018}} , prototype theory was a radical departure from traditional necessary and sufficient conditions as in [[Aristotelian logic]], which led to
set-theoretic approaches of [[Extension (semantics)|extensional]] or [[intension]]al [[semantics]].  Thus instead of a [[definition]] based model—e.g. a bird may be defined as elements with the features [+feathers], [+beak] and [+ability to fly]—prototype theory would consider a category like bird as
consisting of different elements which have unequal status and, therefore, a ''robin'' is considered to be '''more''' prototypical of a ''bird'' than, say, a ''penguin'' (which, for instance) can't fly).  This leads to a graded notion of categories, which is a central notion in many models of [[cognitive science]] and [[cognitive semantics]], e.g. in the work of [[George Lakoff]] (''Women, Fire and Dangerous Things'', 1987) or [[Ronald Langacker]] (''Foundations of Cognitive Grammar'', vol. 1/2 1987/1991).

==Terminology==
The term ''prototype'', as defined in [[Eleanor Rosch]]'s study "Natural Categories" (1973), and was initially defined as denoting a stimulus, which takes a salient position in the formation of a category, due to the fact that it is the first stimulus to be associated with that category. Rosch later defined it as the most central member of a category.&lt;!-- Ways in which human beings deal cognitively with their perceptions of the world. --&gt;

==Categories==
In her 1975 paper, ''Cognitive Representation of Semantic Categories'' (J Experimental Psychology v. 104:192-233), Eleanor Rosch asked 200 American college students to rate, on a scale of 1 to 7, whether they regarded the following items as a good example of the category ''furniture''. This ranged from chair and sofa, ranked number 1, to a love seat (number 10), to a lamp (number 31), all the way to a telephone, ranked number 60.

While one may differ from this list in terms of cultural specifics, the point is that such a graded categorization is likely to be present in all cultures. Further evidence that some members of a category are more privileged than others came from experiments involving:

:1. ''Response Times'': in which queries involving a prototypical members (e.g. ''is a robin a bird'') elicited faster response times than for non-prototypical members.

:2. ''Priming'': When primed with the higher-level (superordinate) category, subjects were faster in identifying if two words are the same.  Thus, after flashing ''furniture'', the equivalence of ''chair-chair'' is detected more rapidly than ''stove-stove''.

:3. ''Exemplars'': When asked to name a few exemplars, the more prototypical items came up more frequently.

Subsequent to Rosch's work, prototype effects have been investigated widely in areas such as colour cognition ([[Brent Berlin]] and [[Paul Kay]], 1969), and also for more abstract notions.  Subjects may be asked, e.g. "to what degree is this narrative an instance of telling a lie?" [Coleman/Kay:1981].  Similarly work has been done on actions (verbs like look, kill, speak, walk [Pulman:83]), adjectives like "tall" [Dirven/Taylor:88], etc.

Another aspect in which Prototype Theory departs from traditional [[Aristotelian categorization]] is that there do not appear to be [[natural kind]] categories (bird, dog) vs. artifacts (toys, vehicles).

A common comparison is the use of prototype or the use of exemplars in category classification. Medin, Altom, and Murphy (1984) found that using a mixture of prototype and exemplar information, participants were more accurately able to judge categories. Participants who were presented with prototype values classified based on similarity to stored prototypes and stored exemplars, whereas participants who only had experience with exemplar only relied on the similarity to stored exemplars. Smith and Minda (2002) looked at the use of prototypes and exemplars in dot-pattern category learning. They found that participants used more prototypes than they used exemplars, with the prototypes being the center of the category, and exemplars surrounding it.

===Basic level categories===

The other notion related to prototypes is that of a ''basic level'' in cognitive categorization. When asked ''What are you sitting on?'', most subjects prefer to say chair rather than a subordinate such as ''kitchen chair'' or a superordinate such as ''furniture''.  Basic categories are relatively homogeneous in terms of sensory-motor [[affordance]]s — a chair is associated with bending of one's knees, a fruit with picking it up and putting it in your mouth, etc.  At the subordinate level (e.g. [dentist's chairs], [kitchen chairs] etc.) hardly any significant features can be added to that of the basic level; whereas at the superordinate level, these conceptual similarities are hard to pinpoint.  A picture of a chair is easy to draw (or visualize), but drawing furniture would be difficult.

Rosch (1978) defines the basic level as that level that has the highest degree of cue validity. Thus, a category like [animal] may have a prototypical member, but no cognitive visual representation.  On the other hand, basic categories in [animal], i.e. [dog], [bird], [fish], are full of informational content and can easily be categorized in terms of [[Gestaltism|Gestalt]] and semantic features.

Clearly semantic models based on attribute-value pairs fail to identify privileged levels in the hierarchy.  Functionally, it is thought that basic level categories are a decomposition of the world into maximally [[Information Theory|informative]] categories.  Thus, they
* maximize the number of attributes shared by members of the category, and
* minimize the number of attributes shared with other categories

However, the notion of Basic Level is problematic, e.g. whereas dog as a basic category is a species, bird or fish are at a higher level, etc.  Similarly, the notion of frequency is very closely tied to the basic level, but is hard to pinpoint.

More problems arise when the notion of a prototype is applied to lexical categories other than the noun. Verbs, for example, seem to defy a clear prototype: [to run] is hard to split up in more or less central members.

===Prototype and category formation and autism===
[[Autism]] has been shown to affect category and prototype formation. Gastgeb, Dundas, Minshew, and Strauss (2011) found that adults with high-functioning autism had difficulty forming categories and prototypes for dot patterns. Compared to those without autism, the pattern of results was the same, but overall performance of the autism groups was significantly lower.

Individuals with autism have also been shown to have differences in the formation of prototypes for faces. Gatsgeb, Wilkinson, Minshew, and Strauss (2011), in a separate study from the above, found that adults with high-functioning autism have significant difficulty in forming prototypes for faces. After shown a series of faces based on prototypes faces, those with autism had a harder time identifying the prototype faces than those without autism.

Children with autism also show prototype effects. Molesworth, Bowler, and Hampton (2008) found that two-thirds of their sample of autistic children with high-functioning autism did not show diminished prototype effects, while one-third showed no prototype effects. Molesworth, Bowler, and Hampton (2005) found signs of the prototype effect is children with autism and [[Asperger syndrome]] showed signs of prototype effects, yet the effects were not diminished from children without autism or Asperger syndrome.

==Distance between concepts==
The notion of prototypes is related to [[Wittgenstein]]'s (later) discomfort with the traditional notion of category. This influential theory has resulted in a view of semantic components more as ''possible'' rather than necessary contributors to the meaning of texts.  His discussion on the category ''game'' is particularly incisive (Philosophical Investigations 66, 1953):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
   Consider for example the proceedings that we call 'games'. I mean board games,
   card games, ball games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all?
   Don't say, "There must be something common, or they would not be called
   'games'"--but look and see whether there is anything common to all. For if
   you look at them you will not see something common to all, but similarities,
   relationships, and a whole series of them at that. To repeat: don't think,
   but look! Look for example at board games, with their multifarious
   relationships. Now pass to card games; here you find many correspondences
   with the first group, but many common features drop out, and others appear.
   When we pass next to ball games, much that is common is retained, but much
   is lost. Are they all 'amusing'? Compare chess with noughts and crosses. Or
   is there always winning and losing, or competition between players? Think of
   patience. In ball games there is winning and losing; but when a child throws
   his ball at the wall and catches it again, this feature has disappeared. Look
   at the parts played by skill and luck; and at the difference between skill in
   chess and skill in tennis. Think now of games like ring-a-ring-a-roses; here
   is the element of amusement, but how many other characteristic features have
   disappeared! And we can go through the many, many other groups of games in the
   same way; can see how similarities crop up and disappear. And the result of
   this examination is: we see a complicated network of similarities overlapping
   and criss-crossing: sometimes overall similarities, sometimes similarities of
   detail.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Clearly, the notion of
''[[family resemblance]]'' is calling for a notion of conceptual distance, which is closely related to the idea of graded sets, but there are problems as well.

Recently, [[Peter Gärdenfors]] ([[#Gardenfors2004|2004]]) has elaborated a possible partial explanation of prototype theory in terms of multi-dimensional feature spaces called [[conceptual space]]s, where a category is defined in terms of a conceptual distance. More central members of a category are "between" the peripheral members. He postulates that most ''natural'' categories exhibit a convexity in conceptual space, in that if x and y are elements of a category, and if z is ''between'' x and y, then z is also likely to belong to the category.

However, in the notion of game above, is there a single prototype or several? Recent linguistic data from colour studies seem to indicate that categories may have more than one focal element—e.g. the [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]] colour term ''rihlaza'' refers to a green-blue continuum, but appears to have two prototypes, a focal blue, and a focal green. Thus, it is possible to have single categories with multiple, disconnected, prototypes, in which case they may constitute the union of several convex sets rather than a single one.

==Combining categories==
All around us, we find instances where objects like ''tall man'' or ''small elephant'' combine one or more categories. This was a problem for extensional semantics, where the semantics of a word such as ''red'' is to be defined as the set of objects having this property. Clearly, this does not apply so well to modifiers such as ''small''; a ''small mouse'' is very different from a ''small elephant''.

These combinations pose a lesser problem in terms of prototype theory. In situations involving adjectives (e.g. ''tall''), one encounters the question of whether or not the prototype of [tall] is a 6 foot tall man, or a 400-foot skyscraper [Dirven and Taylor 1988]. The solution emerges by contextualizing the notion of prototype in terms of the object being modified. This extends even more radically in compounds such as ''red wine'' or ''red hair'' which are hardly ''red'' in the prototypical sense, but the red indicates merely a shift from the prototypical colour of wine or hair respectively. This corresponds to [[de Saussure]]'s notion of concepts as purely differential: "non pas positivement par leur contenu, mais negativement par leurs rapports avec les autres termes du systeme" [p.&amp;nbsp;162; not positively, in terms of their content, but negatively by contrast with other terms in the same system (tr. Harris 83)].

Other problems remain—e.g. in determining which of the constituent categories will contribute which feature?  In the example of a "pet bird" [Hampton 97], ''pet'' provides the habitat of the compound (cage rather than the wild), whereas ''bird'' provides the skin type (feathers rather than fur).

[[File:rastrum02.jpg|thumb|Single-staff rastrum]]
[[File:Staff240.svg|240px|thumb|right|Musical staff]]

A '''rastrum''' (or '''raster''') is a five-pointed [[writing implement]] used in [[music manuscript]]s to draw parallel [[staff (music)|staff]] lines when drawn horizontally across a blank piece of [[sheet music]]. The word "raster" is derived from the Latin for "rake". Rastra were used to draw lines on [[paper]] that had not been pre-ruled, and were widely used in Europe until printed [[staff paper]] became cheap and common in the nineteenth century. Some rastra are able to draw more than one staff at a time. '''Rastrology''', the study of the use of the rastrum, is a branch of music [[manuscript]] studies that uses information about the rastrum to help find the date and provenance of musical materials.

== Modern variants ==
[[File:rastrum03.jpg|thumb|Roller type rastrum which can draw two staff sizes.]]

In recent years, rastra made of five ballpoint [[pen]]s have been marketed to students and composers.

It was common in primary and secondary schools to use rastra that use chalk on a chalk board for music education. They may be called  '''staff liners.''' An alternative is to use a chalk board with staff lines etched in or taped on.

Some rastra hold markers for use on [[whiteboards]].

Another variant is the so-called "Stravigor", a wheeled instrument that [[Stravinsky]] attempted to patent around 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11213">'''Rational mysticism''', which encompasses both [[rationalism]] and [[mysticism]], is a term used by [[Academia|scholars]], [[Scientific method|researchers]], and other [[intellectual]]s, some of whom engage in studies of how [[Altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]] or [[Transcendence (philosophy)#Colloquial usage|transcendence]] such as [[trance]], [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]], and [[prayer]] occur. Lines of investigation include [[History|historical]] and [[Philosophy|philosophical]] [[inquiry]] as well as [[Models of scientific inquiry|scientific inquiry]] within such fields as [[neurophysiology]] and [[psychology]].

==Overview==
The term "rational mysticism" was in use at least as early as 1911 when it was the subject of an article by Henry W. Clark in the ''[[Harvard Theological Review]].''&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;  In a 1924 book, ''Rational Mysticism,''  [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] William Kingsland correlated rational mysticism with scientific [[idealism]].&lt;ref name="KingslandBook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KingslandTheosophy"/&gt;  South African philosopher [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J. N. Findlay]] frequently used the term, developing the theme in ''Ascent to the Absolute'' and other works in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref name="WilberBook"/&gt;

Columbia University [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] [[John Herman Randall, Jr.]] characterized both [[Plotinus]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]] as “rationalists with overtones of rational mysticism” in his 1970 book ''Hellenistic Ways of Deliverance and the Making of Christian Synthesis.''&lt;ref name="RandallPlotinos"/&gt;  
Rice University professor of [[religious studies]] [[Jeffrey J. Kripal]], in his 2001 book ''Roads of Excess, Palaces of Wisdom,'' defined rational mysticism as “not a contradiction in terms” but “a mysticism whose limits are set by reason.”&lt;ref name="KripalBook"/&gt;

In response to criticism of his book ''[[The End of Faith]]'', author [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] used the term rational mysticism for the title of his rebuttal.&lt;ref name="HarrisEssay"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NandaWheels"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HarrisNeuroNYPL"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HarrisNeuroABC"/&gt;  University of Pennsylvania [[Neurotheology|neurotheologist]] [[Andrew B. Newberg|Andrew Newberg]] has been using [[nuclear medicine]] [[brain imaging]] in similar research since the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="NewbergCNN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NewbergForum"/&gt;

Executive editor of ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' magazine Corey S. Powell, in his 2002 book, ''God in the Equation,''   attributed the term to [[Albert Einstein]]: “In creating his radical cosmology, Einstein stitched together a rational mysticism, drawing on—but distinct from—the views that came before.”&lt;ref name="PowellBook"/&gt;

Science writer [[John Horgan (American journalist)|John Horgan]] interviewed and profiled [[James H. Austin|James Austin]], [[Terence McKenna]], [[Michael Persinger]], [[Christian Rätsch]], [[Huston Smith]], [[Ken Wilber]] and others for ''Rational Mysticism: Dispatches from the Border Between Science and Spirituality,''&lt;ref name="TeresiReview"/&gt;  his 2003 study of “the scientific quest to explain the transcendent.”&lt;ref name="McCauleyBook"/&gt;

'''Space weather''' is a branch of [[space physics]] and [[aeronomy]] concerned with the time varying conditions within the Solar System, including the [[solar wind]], emphasizing the space surrounding the Earth, including conditions in the [[magnetosphere]], [[ionosphere]], [[thermosphere]], and [[exosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Barbara B. |last1=Poppe |first2=Kristen P. |last2=Jorden |year=2006 |publisher=Johnson Books, Boulder, Colorado |title=Sentinels of the Sun: Forecasting Space Weather|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Sentinels_of_the_Sun.html?id=WMh4REf3iZQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Space weather is distinct from the terrestrial [[weather]] of the [[Earth's atmosphere]] ([[troposphere]] and [[stratosphere]]). The term ''space weather'' was first used in the 1950s and came into common usage in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Cade III |first = William B. |author2 = Christina Chan-Park |title = The Origin of "Space Weather" |journal = Space Weather |volume = |issue = |pages = |date = 2015 |doi = 10.1002/2014SW001141 |bibcode = 2015SpWea..13...99C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
For many centuries, the effects of space weather were noticed but not understood. Displays of [[aurora (astronomy)|auroral]] light have long been observed at high latitudes.

=== Genesis ===
In 1724, [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] reported that the needle of a [[magnetic compass]] was regularly deflected from [[magnetic north]] over the course of each day. This effect was eventually attributed to overhead electric currents flowing in the ionosphere and magnetosphere by [[Balfour Stewart]] in 1882, and confirmed by [[Arthur Schuster]] in 1889 from analysis of magnetic observatory data.

In 1852, astronomer and British major general [[Edward Sabine]] showed that the probability of the occurrence of magnetic storms on Earth was correlated with the number of [[sunspots]], thus demonstrating a novel solar-terrestrial interaction. In 1859, a great [[Solar storm of 1859|magnetic storm]] caused brilliant auroral displays and disrupted global [[telegraph]] operations. [[Richard Christopher Carrington|Richard Carrington]] correctly connected the storm with a [[solar flare]] that he had observed the day before in the vicinity of a large sunspot group—thus demonstrating that specific solar events could affect the Earth.

[[Kristian Birkeland]] explained the physics of aurora by creating artificial aurora in his laboratory and predicted the [[solar wind]]. The introduction of radio revealed that periods of extreme static or noise occurred. Severe [[radar jamming]] during a large solar event in 1942 led to the discovery of solar radio bursts (radio waves which cover a broad frequency range created by a [[solar flare]]), another aspect of space weather.

=== Twentieth century ===
In the 20th century the interest in space weather expanded as military and commercial systems came to depend on systems affected by space weather. [[Communications satellites]] are a vital part of global commerce. [[Weather satellite]] systems provide information about terrestrial weather. The signals from satellites of the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) are used in a wide variety of applications. Space weather phenomena can interfere with or damage these satellites or interfere with the radio signals with which they operate. Space weather phenomena can cause damaging surges in long distance [[Overhead power line|transmission lines]] and expose passengers and crew of aircraft travel to [[radiation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fisher | first1 = Genene M | title = ''Integrating Space Weather and Meteorological Products for Aviation'', (2003) | url = | journal = Bull.

The [[International Geophysical Year]] (IGY) increased research into space weather. Ground-based data obtained during IGY demonstrated that the aurora occurred in an ''auroral oval'', a permanent region of luminescence 15 to 25 degrees in latitude from the magnetic poles and 5 to 20 degrees wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feldstein | first1 = Y.

(Toronto: MacFarlane Walter &amp; Ross, 2001), 190.&lt;/ref&gt; regions of radiation particles trapped by the Earth's magnetic field. In January 1959, the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[satellite]] [[Luna 1]] first directly observed the solar wind and measured its strength.

In 1969, INJUN-5 (a.k.a. Explorer 40&lt;ref&gt;[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1968-066B NASA NSSDC INJUN-5 page]&lt;/ref&gt;) made the first direct observation of the electric field impressed on the Earth's high latitude [[ionosphere]] by the solar wind.&lt;ref&gt;Cauffman, D., and D. Gurnett (1971), Double-Probe Measurements of Convection Electric Fields with the Injun-5 Satellite, J. Geophys. Res., 76(25), 6014-6027&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, Triad data demonstrated that permanent electric currents flowed between the auroral oval and the [[magnetosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Zmuda and J. C. Armstrong, ''The Diurnal Flow Pattern of Field-Aligned Currents'', J. Geophys. Res., 79, 31, 4611pp, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

The term space weather came into usage in the 1990s along with the belief that space's impact on human systems demanded a more coordinated research and application framework.&lt;ref name="nas1997"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Space Weather: A Research Perspective {{!}} The National Academies Press|url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12272|website = www.nap.edu|accessdate = 2015-07-24 |publisher=National Academy of Science |year=1997 |quote=Space weather describes the conditions in space that affect Earth and its technological systems.

== US National Space Weather Program ==
The purpose of the US National Space Weather Program is to focus research on the needs of the affected commercial and military communities, to connect the research and user communities, to create coordination between operational data centers and to better define user community needs.

The concept was turned into an action plan in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ofcm.gov/nswp-ip/pdf/nswpip.pdf |title=The National Space Weather Program: Strategic Plan, Implementation Plan and Space Weather Architecture Transition Plan and Report of the Assessment Committee for the NSWP |publisher=Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology |year=2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030417130810/http://www.ofcm.gov/nswp-ip/pdf/nswpip.pdf |archivedate=2003-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; an implementation plan in 2002, an assessment in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nswp.gov/nswp_acreport0706.pdf|title = Report of the Assessment Committee for the National Space Weather Program|date = 2006|accessdate = July 24, 2015|website = |publisher = Office of the Federal Coordinator for Meteorology|last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303185726/http://www.nswp.gov/nswp_acreport0706.pdf|archivedate = March 3, 2016|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a revised strategic plan in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 2010 National Space Weather Program Strategic Plan|url = http://www.ofcm.gov/nswp-sp/fcm-p30.htm|website = www.ofcm.gov|accessdate = 2015-07-24|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140404153245/http://www.ofcm.gov/nswp-sp/fcm-p30.htm|archivedate = 2014-04-04|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A revised action plan was scheduled to be released in 2011 followed by a revised implementation plan in 2012.

One part of the National Space Weather Program is to show users that space weather affects their business.&lt;ref name="nap.edu"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Severe Space Weather Events--Understanding Societal and Economic Impacts: A Workshop Report {{!}} The National Academies Press|url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog/12507.html|website = www.nap.edu|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private companies now acknowledge space weather "is a real risk for today's businesses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hapgood|first=Mike|title=Space Weather:  Its impact on Earth and implications for business|url=http://www.lloyds.com/~/media/Lloyds/Reports/360/360%20Space%20Weather/7311_Lloyds_360_Space%20Weather_03.pdf|work=Lloyd's 360 Risk Insight|publisher=[[Lloyd's of London]]|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phenomena==
Within the [[solar system]], space weather is influenced by the [[solar wind]] and the [[interplanetary magnetic field]] (IMF) carried by the solar wind [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. A variety of physical phenomena are associated with space weather, including [[geomagnetic storm]]s and substorms, energization of the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, ionospheric disturbances and [[scintillation (astronomy)|scintillation]] of satellite-to-ground radio signals and long-range radar signals, [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]] and [[geomagnetically induced current]]s at Earth's surface. [[Coronal mass ejection]]s and their associated [[shock wave]]s are also important drivers of space weather as they can compress the [[magnetosphere]] and trigger [[geomagnetic storm]]s. [[Solar energetic particles]] (SEP), accelerated by coronal mass ejections or [[solar flare]]s, are also an important driver of space weather as they can damage electronics onboard spacecraft (e.g. [[Galaxy 15]] failure), and threaten the lives of [[astronaut]]s.

==Effects==

===Spacecraft electronics===
[[File:ExtremeEvent 20031026-00h 20031106-24h.jpg|thumb|right|320px|GOES-11 and GOES-12 monitored space weather conditions during the October 2003 solar activity.&lt;ref name="Extreme Space Weather Events"&gt;{{cite web | title=Extreme Space Weather Events | publisher=[[National Geophysical Data Center]] | url=http://sxi.ngdc.noaa.gov/sxi_greatest.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Some spacecraft failures can be directly attributed to space weather; many more are thought to have a space weather component. For example, 46 of the 70 failures reported in 2003 occurred during the October 2003 geomagnetic storm. The two most common adverse space weather effects on spacecraft are [[radiation damage]] and [[spacecraft charging]].

Radiation (high energy particles) passes through the skin of the spacecraft and into the electronic components. In most cases the radiation causes an erroneous signal or changes one bit in memory of a spacecraft's electronics ([[single event upset]]s). In a few cases, the radiation destroys a section of the electronics ([[latchup|single-event latchup]]).

Spacecraft charging is the accumulation of an [[electrostatic charge]] on a non-conducting material on the spacecraft's surface by low energy particles. If enough charge is built up, a discharge (spark) occurs. This can cause an erroneous signal to be detected and acted on by the spacecraft computer. A recent study indicates that spacecraft charging is the predominant space weather effect on spacecraft in [[geosynchronous orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Choi|first=Ho-Sung |author2=J. Lee |author3=K.-S. Cho |author4=Y.-S. Kwak |author5=I.-H. Cho |author6=Y.-D. Park |author7=Y.-H. Kim |author8=[[Daniel N. Baker|D. N. Baker]] |author9=G. D. Reeves |author10=D.-K. Lee |title=Analysis of GEO spacecraft anomalies: Space weather relationships|journal=Space Weather|year=2011|volume=9|issue=S06001|page=12|doi=10.1029/2010SW000597|bibcode = 2011SpWea...906001C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spacecraft orbit changes===
The orbits of spacecraft in [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) decay to lower and lower altitudes due to the resistance from the friction between the spacecraft's surface (''i.e. '', drag) and the outer layer of the Earth's atmosphere (a.k.a. the [[thermosphere]] and [[exosphere]]). Eventually, a LEO spacecraft falls out of orbit and towards the Earth's surface. Many spacecraft launched in the past couple of decades have the ability to fire a small rocket to manage their orbits. The rocket can increase altitude to extend lifetime, to direct the reentry towards a particular (marine) site, or route the satellite to avoid collision with other spacecraft. Such maneuvers require precise information about the orbit. A [[geomagnetic storm]] can cause an orbit change over a couple of days that otherwise would occur over a year or more. The [[geomagnetic storm]] adds heat to the thermosphere, causing the thermosphere to expand and rise, increasing the drag on spacecraft. The [[2009 satellite collision]] between the Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 demonstrated the importance of having precise knowledge of all objects in orbit. Iridium 33 had the capability to maneuver out of the path of Cosmos 2251 and could have evaded the crash, if a credible collision prediction had been available,

===Humans in space===
{{main article|Effect of spaceflight on the human body}}
The exposure of a human body to [[ionizing radiation]] has the same [[acute radiation syndrome|harmful effects]] whether the source of the radiation is a medical [[X-ray machine]], a [[nuclear power plant]] or radiation in space. The degree of the harmful effect depends on the length of exposure and the radiation's [[energy density]]. The ever-present [[radiation belt]]s extend down to the altitude of manned spacecraft such as the [[International Space Station#Radiation|International Space Station]] (ISS) and the [[Space Shuttle]], but the amount of exposure is within the [[Spaceflight radiation carcinogenesis#Current Permissible Exposure Limits|acceptable lifetime exposure limit]] under normal conditions. During a major space weather event that includes an SEP burst, the flux can increase by orders of magnitude. Areas within ISS provide shielding that can keep the total dose within safe limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Space station radiation shields 'disappointing' - New Scientist|url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn2956-space-station-radiation-shields-disappointing.html|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Space Shuttle]], such an event would have required immediate mission termination.

===Ground systems===
[[Image:SpaceWeather-artl.jpg|thumb|Art inspired from the concept of space weather]]

====Spacecraft signals====
The [[ionosphere]] bends radio waves in the same manner that water in a swimming pool bends visible light. When the medium through which such waves travel is disturbed, the light image or radio information is distorted and can become unrecognizable. The degree of distortion (scintillation) of a radio wave by the ionosphere depends on the signal frequency. Radio signals in the [[very high frequency|VHF]] band (30 to 300&amp;nbsp;MHz) can be distorted beyond recognition by a disturbed ionosphere. Radio signals in the [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] band (300&amp;nbsp;MHz to 3&amp;nbsp;GHz) transit a disturbed ionosphere, but a receiver may not be able to keep locked to the carrier frequency. GPS uses signals at 1575.42&amp;nbsp;MHz (L1) and 1227.6&amp;nbsp;MHz (L2) that can be distorted by a disturbed ionosphere. Space weather events that corrupt GPS signals can significantly impact society. For example, the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS) operated by the US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] is used as a navigation tool for North American commercial aviation. It is disabled by every major space weather event. Outages can range from minutes to days. Major space weather events can push the disturbed polar ionosphere 10° to 30° of latitude toward the equator and can cause large ionospheric gradients (changes in density over distance of hundreds of km) at mid and low latitude. Both of these factors can distort GPS signals.

===Long-distance radio signals===
Radio wave in the [[high frequency|HF]] band (3 to 30&amp;nbsp;MHz) (also known as the [[shortwave]] band) are reflected by the ionosphere. Since the ground also reflects HF waves, a signal can be transmitted around the curvature of the Earth beyond the line of sight. During the 20th century, HF communications was the only method for a ship or aircraft far from land or a base station to communicate. The advent of systems such as [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium]] brought other methods of communications, but HF remains critical for vessels that do not carry the newer equipment and as a critical backup system for others. Space weather events can create irregularities in the ionosphere that scatter HF signals instead of reflecting them, preventing HF communications. At auroral and polar latitudes, small space weather events that occur frequently disrupt HF communications. At mid-latitudes, HF communications are disrupted by solar radio bursts, by X-rays from solar flares (which enhance and disturb the ionospheric D-layer) and by [[Total Electron Content|TEC]] enhancements and irregularities during major geomagnetic storms.

Trans[[polar route|polar airline route]]s are particularly sensitive to space weather, in part because [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] require reliable communication over the entire flight.&lt;ref&gt;FAA Advisory Circular 120-42B, June 6, 2008, Extended Operations (ETOPS and Polar Operations)&lt;/ref&gt; Diverting such a flight is estimated to cost about $100,000.&lt;ref name="nap.edu"/&gt;

[[File:Aviation radiation environment.png|thumbnail|All passengers in commercial aircraft flying above 26,000 feet will typically experience some exposure in this aviation radiation environment.]]

===Humans in commercial aviation ===
The magnetosphere guides cosmic ray and [[solar energetic particles]] to polar latitudes, while high energy charged particles enter the mesosphere, stratosphere and troposphere. These energetic particles at the top of the atmosphere shatter atmospheric atoms and molecules, creating harmful lower energy particles that penetrate deep into the atmosphere and create measurable radiation. All aircraft flying above 8&amp;nbsp;km (26,200 feet) altitude are exposed to these particles. The dose exposure is greater in polar regions than at mid-latitude and equatorial regions. Many commercial aircraft fly over the polar region. When a space weather event causes radiation exposure to exceed the safe level set by aviation authorities,&lt;ref&gt;FAA Advisory Circular 120-52, March 5, 1990, Radiation exposure of air carrier crew members&lt;/ref&gt; the aircraft's flight path is diverted.

While the most significant, but highly unlikely, health consequences to atmospheric radiation exposure include death from cancer due to long-term exposure, many lifestyle-degrading and career-impacting cancer forms can also occur.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, J.W., P. Goldhagen, V. Rafnsson, J.M. Clem, and G. De Angelis (2002), Overview of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation (AIR) Research: SST-Present, COSPAR, Houston, TX.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. K., Tobiska, W. Atwell, P. Beck, E. Benton, K. Copeland, C. Dyer, B. Gersey, I. Getley, A. Hands, M. Holland, S. Hong, J. Hwang, B. Jones, K. Malone, M. M. Meier, C. Mertens, T. Phillips, K. Ryden, N. Schwadron, S. A. Wender, R. Wilkins, M. A. Xapsos, Advances in Atmospheric Radiation Measurements and Modeling Needed to Improve Air Safety, Space Weather, 13, 202-210 (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; A cancer diagnosis can have significant career impact for a commercial pilot. A cancer diagnosis can ground a pilot temporarily or permanently. International guidelines from the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) have been developed to mitigate this statistical risk.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP, 1991. 1990 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection. ICRP Publication 60. Ann. ICRP 21 (1-3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ICRP, 2005. Low-dose Extrapolation of Radiation-related Cancer Risk. ICRP Publication 99. Ann. ICRP 35 (4).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ICRP, 2007. The 2007 Recommendations of the International Commission on Radiologi-cal Protection. ICRP Publication 103. Ann. ICRP 37 (2-4).&lt;/ref&gt; The ICRP recommends effective dose limits of a 5-year average of 20 [[sievert|mSv]] per year with no more than 50&amp;nbsp;mSv in a single year for non-pregnant, occupationally exposed persons, and 1&amp;nbsp;mSv per year for the general public. Radiation dose limits are not engineering limits. In the U.S., they are treated as an upper limit of acceptability and not a regulatory limit.&lt;ref&gt;NCRP Report No. 116 - Limitation of Exposure to Ionizing Radiation, National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Measurements of the radiation environment at commercial aircraft altitudes above 8&amp;nbsp;km (26,000&amp;nbsp;ft) have historically been done by instruments that record the data on board where the data are then processed later on the ground. However, a system of real-time radiation measurements on-board aircraft has been developed through the NASA Automated Radiation Measurements for Aerospace Safety (ARMAS) program.&lt;ref&gt;W. K., Tobiska, D. Bouwer, D. Smart, M. Shea, J. Bailey, L. Didkovsky, K. Judge, H. Garrett, W. Atwell, B. Gersey, R. Wilkins, D. Rice, R. Schunk, D. Bell, C. Mertens, X. Xu, M. Wiltberger, S. Wiley, E. Teets, B. Jones, S. Hong, K. Yoon, Global real-time dose measurements using the Automated Radiation Measurements for Aerospace Safety (ARMAS) system, Space Weather, 14, 1053-1080 (2016).&lt;/ref&gt; [http://sol.spacenvironment.net/~ARMAS/ ARMAS] has flown hundreds of flights since 2013, mostly on research aircraft, and sent the data to the ground through Iridium satellite links. The eventual goal of these types of measurements is to data assimilate them into physics-based global radiation models, e.g., NASA's Nowcast of Atmospheric Ionizing Radiation System ([http://sol.spacenvironment.net/~nairas/index.html NAIRAS]), so as to provide the weather of the radiation environment rather than the climatology.

===Ground-induced electric fields===
[[Geomagnetic storm|Magnetic storm activity]] can induce geoelectric fields in the Earth's conducting [[lithosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Geomagnetically induced currents during magnetic storms, Pirjola, R., IEEE Trans. Plasma Sci., 28, 6, 1867-73, 2000, {{doi|10.1109/27.902215}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding voltage differentials can [[Geomagnetically induced current|find their way into electric power grids through ground connections]], driving uncontrolled electric currents that interfere with grid operation, damage transformers, trip protective relays and sometimes cause blackouts.&lt;ref&gt;Extreme Space Weather: Impacts on Engineered Systems and Infrastructure, pp. 1-68. Roy. Acad. Engineer., London, UK (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; This complicated chain of causes and effects was demonstrated during [[March 1989 geomagnetic storm|the magnetic storm of March 1989]],&lt;ref&gt;Allen, J., Frank, L., Sauer, H., Reiff, P.: Effects of the March 1989 solar activity. EOS Trans. Am. Geophys. Union 70, 1479,1486-1488 (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; which caused the complete collapse of the [[Hydro-Québec]] electric-power grid in Canada, temporarily leaving nine million people without electricity.

Lloyd's of London, London, UK (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geophysical exploration===
Air- and ship-borne [[aeromagnetic survey|magnetic surveys]] can be affected by rapid magnetic field variations during geomagnetic storms. Such storms cause data interpretation problems because the space-weather-related magnetic field changes are similar in magnitude to those of the sub-surface crustal magnetic field in the survey area. Accurate geomagnetic storm warnings, including an assessment of storm magnitude and duration allows for an economic use of survey equipment.

===Geophysics and hydrocarbon production===
For economic and other reasons, oil and gas production often involves [[directional drilling|horizontal drilling]] of well paths many kilometers from a single wellhead. Accuracy requirements are strict, due to target size – reservoirs may only be a few tens to hundreds of meters across – and safety, because of the proximity of other boreholes. The most accurate gyroscopic method is expensive, since it can stop drilling for hours. An alternative is to use a magnetic survey, which enables [[MWD (measurement while drilling)|measurement while drilling (MWD)]]. Near real-time magnetic data can be used to correct drilling direction.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, T.D.G., Clarke, E. Space weather services for the offshore drilling industry, in: Proceedings of the ESA Space Weather Workshop, ESTEC, the Netherlands, 17–19 Dec, 2001, ESA WPP-194, 2001.; Reay et al., 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Large-magnitude geomagnetic disturbances in the North Sea region: Statistics, causes, and forecasting, H. Gleisner, O. Rasmussen, J. Watermann, (2006), Adv. Space Res. 37, 1169–117, {{doi|10.1016/j.asr.2005.04.082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magnetic data and space weather forecasts can help to clarify unknown sources of drilling error.

===Terrestrial weather===
The amount of energy entering the troposphere and stratosphere from space weather phenomena is trivial compared to the solar [[insolation]] in the visible and infra-red portions of the solar electromagnetic spectrum. However, some linkage between the 11-year sunspot cycle and the Earth's [[climate]] has been claimed.&lt;ref&gt;Variability of the solar cycle length during the past five centuries and the apparent association with terrestrial climate, K. Lassen and E. Friis-Christensen, 57, 8, pp. 835–845, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Maunder minimum]], a 70-year period almost devoid of sunspots, allegedly correlated to a cooler climate. One suggestion for the linkage between space and terrestrial weather is that changes in [[cosmic ray]] flux cause changes in the amount of cloud formation.&lt;ref&gt;What do we really know about the Sun-climate connection?, E. Friis-Christensen and H. Svensmark, Adv. Space Res., 20, 4/5, pp. 913–921, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggestion is that variations in the EUV flux subtly influence existing drivers of the climate and tip the balance between [[El Niño]]/[[La Niña]] events.&lt;ref&gt;Amplifying the Pacific climate system response to a small 11-year solar cycle forcing, Meehl, G.A.; Arblaster, J.M.; Matthes, K.; Sassi, F.; van Loon, H., ''Science'', 325, 5944, 1114-18, 28 Aug. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, a linkage between space weather and the climate has not been demonstrated conclusively.

==Observation==
Observation of space weather is done both for scientific research and for applications. Scientific observation has evolved with the state of knowledge, while application-related observation expanded with the ability to exploit such data.

===Ground-based===
Space weather is monitored at ground level by observing changes in the Earth's magnetic field over periods of seconds to days, by observing the surface of the Sun and by observing radio noise created in the Sun's atmosphere.

The [[Wolf number|Sunspot Number]] (SSN) is the number of [[sunspot]]s on the Sun's photosphere in visible light on the side of the Sun visible to an Earth observer. The number and total area of sunspots are related to the brightness of the Sun in the [[extreme ultraviolet]] (EUV) and X-ray portions of the [[sunlight|solar spectrum]] and to solar activity such as [[solar flare]]s and [[coronal mass ejection]]s (CMEs).

10.7&amp;nbsp;cm radio flux (F10.7) is a measurement of RF emissions from the Sun and is approximately correlated with the solar EUV flux. Since this RF emission is easily obtained from the ground and EUV flux is not, this value has been measured and disseminated continuously since 1947. The world standard measurements are made by the [[Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory]] at Penticton, B.C., Canada and reported once a day at local noon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/ftpdir/lists/radio/7day_rad.txt |title=Last 7 days of solar radio flux |accessdate= |website= |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006071524/http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/ftpdir/lists/radio/7day_rad.txt |archivedate=October 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in solar flux units (10&lt;sup&gt;−22&lt;/sup&gt;J·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). F10.7 is archived by the National Geophysical Data Center.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp.ngdc.noaa.gov/STP/SOLAR_DATA/SOLAR_RADIO/FLUX/  NOAA/NGDC F10.7 archive]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fundamental space weather monitoring data are provided by ground-based magnetometers and magnetic observatories. Magnetic storms were first discovered by ground-based measurement of occasional magnetic disturbance. Ground magnetometer data provide real-time situational awareness for post-event analysis. Magnetic observatories have been in continuous operations for decades to centuries, providing data to inform studies of long-term changes in space climatology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Love, J.

[[Disturbance storm time index|Dst index]] is an estimate of the magnetic field change at the Earth's magnetic equator due to a ring of electric current at and just earthward of the [[geosynchronous orbit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bulletin 40 |first1=Masahisa |last1=SUGIURA |first2=Toyohisa |last2=KAMEI|url = http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dstdir/dst2/onDstindex.html|website = wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The index is based on data from four ground-based magnetic observatories between 21° and 33° magnetic latitude during a one-hour period. Stations closer to the magnetic equator are not used due to ionospheric effects. The Dst index is compiled and archived by the World Data Center for Geomagnetism, Kyoto.&lt;ref name="kyoto"&gt;[http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/wdc/Sec3.html Geomagnetic Data Service] World Data Center for Geomagnetism, Kyoto&lt;/ref&gt;

[[K-index|Kp/ap]] Index: 'a' is an index created from the geomagnetic disturbance at one mid-latitude (40° to 50° latitude) geomagnetic observatory during a 3-hour period. 'K' is the quasi-logarithmic counterpart of the 'a' index. Kp and ap are the average of K and an over 13 geomagnetic observatories to represent planetary-wide geomagnetic disturbances. The Kp/ap index&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/kp-index Helmholtz Centre PotsdamGFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences]&lt;/ref&gt; indicates both [[geomagnetic storm]]s and [[substorm]]s (auroral disturbance). Kp/ap is available from 1932 onward.

AE index is compiled from geomagnetic disturbances at 12 geomagnetic observatories in and near the auroral zones and is recorded at 1-minute intervals.&lt;ref name="kyoto" /&gt; The public AE index is available with a lag of two to three days that limits its utility for space weather applications. The AE index indicates the intensity of geomagnetic [[substorm]]s except during a major [[geomagnetic storm]] when the auroral zones expand equatorward from the observatories.

Radio noise bursts are reported by the Radio Solar Telescope Network to the U.S. Air Force and to NOAA. The radio bursts are associated with solar flare plasma that interacts with the ambient solar atmosphere.

The Sun's photosphere is observed continuously&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/solar_sites.html List of solar observatories] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410190312/http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/solar_sites.html |date=2011-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for activity that can be the precursors to solar flares and CMEs. The Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG)&lt;ref&gt;[http://gong.nso.org Global Oscillation Network Group home page]&lt;/ref&gt; project monitors both the surface and the interior of the Sun by using [[helioseismology]], the study of sound waves propagating through the Sun and observed as ripples on the solar surface. GONG can detect sunspot groups on the far side of the Sun. This ability has recently been verified by visual observations from the [[STEREO]] spacecraft.

[[Neutron monitor]]s on the ground indirectly monitor cosmic rays from the Sun and galactic sources. When cosmic rays interact with the atmosphere, atomic interactions occur that cause a shower of lower energy particles to descend into the atmosphere and to ground level. The presence of cosmic rays in the near-Earth space environment can be detected by monitoring high energy neutrons at ground level. Small fluxes of cosmic rays are present continuously. Large fluxes are produced by the Sun during events related to energetic solar flares.

[[Total Electron Content]] (TEC) is a measure of the ionosphere over a given location. TEC is the number of electrons in a column one meter square from the base of the ionosphere (approximately 90&amp;nbsp;km altitude) to the top of the ionosphere (approximately 1000&amp;nbsp;km altitude). Many TEC measurements are made by monitoring the two frequencies transmitted by [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] spacecraft. Presently GPS TEC is monitored and distributed in real time from more than 360 stations maintained by agencies in many countries.

Geoeffectiveness is a measure of how strongly space weather magnetic fields, such as coronal mass ejections, couple with the Earth's magnetic field. This is determined by the direction of the magnetic field held within the plasma that originates from the Sun. New techniques measuring [[Faraday effect|Faraday Rotation]] in radio waves are in development to measure field direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Under Sunveillance|url=http://www.physics.org/featuredetail.asp?id=73|publisher=physics.org|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Solar-Heliospheric-Ionospheric Science|url=http://www.haystack.mit.edu/mwa/Science%20Goal/Solar-Heliospheric-Ionospheric%20Science/solar.html|publisher=MIT Haystack Observatory|accessdate=12 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

E.|editor-last = Trümper}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Orbiting Geophysical Observatory]] series were among the first spacecraft with the mission of analyzing the space environment. Recent spacecraft include the NASA-ESA Solar-Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) pair of spacecraft launched in 2006 into solar orbit and the [[Van Allen Probes]], launched in 2012 into a highly [[elliptical]] Earth-orbit. The two STEREO spacecraft drift away from the Earth by about 22° per year, one leading and the other trailing the Earth in its orbit. Together they compile information about the solar surface and atmosphere in three dimensions. The Van Allen probes record detailed information about the radiation belts, geomagnetic storms and the relationship between the two.

Some spacecraft with other primary missions have carried auxiliary instruments for solar observation. Among the earliest such spacecraft were the [[Applications Technology Satellite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = NASA -  ATS|url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/missions/ats.html|website = www.nasa.gov|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (ATS) series at GEO that were precursors to the modern [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite]] (GOES) weather satellite and many communication satellites. The ATS spacecraft carried environmental particle sensors as auxiliary payloads and had their navigational magnetic field sensor used for sensing the environment.

Many of the early instruments were research spacecraft that were re-purposed for space weather applications. One of the first of these was the IMP-8 (Interplanetary Monitoring Platform)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IMP-8 Project Information|url = http://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/imp8/project.html|website = spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It orbited the Earth at 35 Earth Radii and observed the solar wind for two-thirds of its 12-day orbits from 1973 to 2006. Since the solar wind carries disturbances that affect the magnetosphere and ionosphere, IMP-8 demonstrated the utility of continuous solar wind monitoring. IMP-8 was followed by [[International Cometary Explorer|ISEE-3]], which was placed near the {{L1}} [[Sun]]-[[Earth]] [[Lagrangian point]], 235 Earth radii above the surface (about 1.5 million km, or 924,000 miles) and continuously monitored the solar wind from 1978 to 1982. The next spacecraft to monitor the solar wind at the {{L1}} point was [[WIND (spacecraft)|WIND]] from 1994 to 1998. After April 1998, the WIND spacecraft orbit was changed to circle the Earth and occasionally pass the {{L1}} point. The NASA [[Advanced Composition Explorer]] (ACE) has monitored the solar wind at the {{L1}} point from 1997 to present.

In addition to monitoring the solar wind, monitoring the Sun is important to space weather. Because the solar EUV cannot be monitored from the ground, the joint [[NASA]]-[[ESA]] [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]] (SOHO) spacecraft was launched and has provided solar EUV images beginning in 1995. SOHO is a main source of near-real time solar data for both research and space weather prediction and inspired the [[STEREO]] mission. The [[Yohkoh]] spacecraft at LEO observed the Sun from 1991 to 2001 in the X-ray portion of the solar spectrum and was useful for both research and space weather prediction. Data from Yohkoh inspired the [[Solar X-ray Imager]] on GOES.

[[File:ExtremeEvent 19891018-00h 19891031-24h.jpg|thumb|right|320px|GOES-7 monitors space weather conditions during the October 1989 solar activity resulted in a Forbush Decrease, Ground Level Enhancements, and many satellite anomalies.&lt;ref name="Extreme Space Weather Events"/&gt;]]

Spacecraft with instruments whose primary purpose is to provide data for space weather predictions and applications include the [[Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite]] (GOES) series of spacecraft, the [[Polar Operational Environmental Satellites|POES]] series, the [[Defense Meteorological Satellite Program|DMSP]] series, and the [[Meteosat]] series. The GOES spacecraft have carried an X-ray sensor (XRS) which measures the flux from the whole solar disk in two bands – 0.05 to 0.4&amp;nbsp;nm and 0.1 to 0.8&amp;nbsp;nm – since 1974, an X-ray imager (SXI) since 2004, a magnetometer which measures the distortions of the Earth’s magnetic field due to space weather, a whole disk [[extreme ultraviolet|EUV]] sensor since 2004, and particle sensors (EPS/HEPAD) which measure ions and electrons in the energy range of 50 keV to 500 MeV. Starting sometime after 2015, the GOES-R generation of GOES spacecraft will replace the SXI with a solar EUV image (SUVI) similar to the one on [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] and [[STEREO]] and the particle sensor will be augmented with a component to extend the energy range down to 30&amp;nbsp;eV.

The [[Deep Space Climate Observatory]] (DSCOVR) satellite is a [[NOAA]] Earth observation and space weather satellite that launched in February 2015. Among its features is advance warning of coronal mass ejections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/nasa-set-to-launch-satellite-t/40450948 | title = NOAA's DSCOVR Satellite Launch Attempt Delayed by Technical Issues | first = Mark | last = Leberfinger | work = AccuWeather.com | publisher = AccuWeather, Inc. | date = February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Models==
Space weather models are simulations of the space weather environment. Models use sets of mathematical equations to describe physical processes.

These models take a limited data set and attempt to describe all or part of the space weather environment in or to predict how weather evolves over time. Early models were heuristic; i.e''., '' they did not directly employ physics. These models take less resources than their more sophisticated descendants.

Later models use physics to account for as many phenomena as possible. No model can yet reliably predict the environment from the surface of the Sun to the bottom of the Earth's ionosphere. Space weather models differ from meteorological models in that the amount of input is vastly smaller.

A significant portion of space weather model research and development in the past two decades has been done as part of the [[outer space#Geospace|Geospace]] Environmental Model (GEM) program of the [[National Science Foundation]]. The two major modeling centers are the Center for Space Environment Modeling (CSEM)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CSEM - Center for Space Environment Modeling|url = http://csem.engin.umich.edu/|website = csem.engin.umich.edu|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Center for Integrated Space weather Modeling (CISM).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CISM // Home|url = http://www.bu.edu/cism/|website = www.bu.edu|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Community Coordinated Modeling Center]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/|title = NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center|accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (CCMC) at the NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] is a facility for coordinating the development and testing of research models, for improving and preparing models for use in space weather prediction and application.&lt;ref&gt;Wang-Sheeley-Arge-Enlil Cone Model Transitions to Operations, Pizzo, V., G. Millward, A. Parsons, D. Biesecker, S. Hill, and D. Odstrcil (2011), Space Weather, 9, S03004, {{doi|10.1029/2011SW000663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modeling techniques include (a) [[magnetohydrodynamics]], in which the environment is treated as a fluid, (b) particle in cell, in which non-fluid interactions are handled within a cell and then cells are connected to describe the environment, (c) first principles, in which physical processes are in balance (or equilibrium) with one another, (d) semi-static modeling, in which a statistical or empirical relationship is described, or a combination of multiple methods.

== Commercial space weather development ==
During the first decade of the 21st Century, a commercial sector emerged that engaged in space weather, serving agencies, commercial and consumers.&lt;ref&gt;National Academies Press, "Solar and Space Physics: A Science for a Technological Society," Committee on a Decadal Strategy for Solar and Space Physics (Heliophysics); Space Studies Board; Aeronautics and Space Engineering Board; Division of Earth and Physical Sciences; National Research Council {{ISBN|978-0-309-16428-3}}, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Space weather providers are mostly small companies that provide space weather data, models, derivative products and service distribution.

The commercial sector includes scientific and engineering researchers as well as users. Activities are primarily directed toward the impacts of space weather upon technology. These include, for example: 
* Atmospheric drag on LEO satellites caused by energy inputs into the thermosphere from solar UV, FUV, [[Lyman series|Lyman-alpha]], [[EUV]], [[Extreme ultraviolet|XUV]] and X-ray photons as well as by charged particle precipitation and [[Joule heating]] at high latitudes; 
* Surface and internal charging from increased energetic particle fluxes, leading to effects such as discharges, single event upsets and latch-up, on LEO to GEO satellites; 
* Disrupted GPS signals caused by ionospheric scintillation leading to increased uncertainty in navigation systems such as aviation’s [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS);
* Lost HF, UHF and L-band radio communications due to ionosphere scintillation, solar flares and geomagnetic storms; 
* Increased radiation to human tissue and avionics from [[galactic cosmic rays]] and SEP, especially during large solar flares, at altitudes above 8&amp;nbsp;km;&lt;ref&gt;Tobiska, et al., Advances in atmospheric radiation measurements and modeling needed to improve international air safety, Space Weather Journal, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Increased inaccuracy in surveying and oil/gas exploration that uses the Earth’s main magnetic field when it is disturbed by geomagnetic storms;
* Loss of power transmission from GIC surges in the electrical power grid and transformer shutdowns during large geomagnetic storms. 
Many of these disturbances result in societal impacts that account for a significant part of the national GDP.

The concept of a Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone stems from the work of the American Commercial Space Weather Association (ACSWA) in 2015. The establishment of this economic innovation zone would encourage expanded economic activity developing applications to manage the risks space weather and would encourage broader research activities related to space weather by universities. The formation of a Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone would: encourage U.S. business investment in space weather services and products; support U.S. business innovation in space weather services and products; require U.S. government purchases of U.S. built commercial hardware, software, and associated products and services where no suitable government capability pre-exists; promote U.S. built commercial hardware, software, and associated products and services to international partners; designate U.S. built commercial hardware, services, and products as “Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone” activities; and track U.S. built commercial hardware, services, and products as Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone contributions within agency reports. In 2015 HR1561 provided groundwork where social and environmental impacts from a Space Weather Economic Innovation Zone could be far-reaching. U.S. built commercial hardware, services, and products can prevent economic disruptions and loss-of-life from societal risks resulting from space weather and an innovation zone would encourage the research and investment needed for this success. In 2016, the Space Weather Research and Forecasting Act (S. 2817) would potentially build on that legacy.

=== American Commercial Space Weather Association ===
On April 29, 2010, the commercial space weather community created the American Commercial Space Weather Association ([http://acswa.us ACSWA]) an industry association. ACSWA promotes space weather risk mitigation for national infrastructure, economic strength and national security. It seeks to:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ACSWA Capabilities|url = http://www.acswa.us/capabilities.html|website = www.acswa.us|accessdate = 2015-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* provide quality space weather data and services to help mitigate risks to technology;
* provide advisory services to government agencies;
* provide guidance on the best task division between commercial providers and government agencies;
* represent the interests of commercial providers;
* represent commercial capabilities in the national and international arena; 
* develop best-practices.

A summary of the broad technical capabilities in space weather that are available from the association can be found on their web site http://www.acswa.us.

==Notable events==
{{main article|List of solar storms}}

*August 7, 1972, a large SEP event occurred. If astronauts had been in space at the time, the dose would have been at least life-threatening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Solar Sentinels  - NASA Science|url = https://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2006/01sep_sentinels.htm|website = science.nasa.gov|accessdate = 2015-07-24|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090930104605/http://science.nasa.gov/headlines/y2006/01sep_sentinels.htm|archivedate = 2009-09-30|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The [[March 1989 geomagnetic storm]] included multiple space weather effects: SEP, CME, Forbush decrease, ground level enhancement, geomagnetic storm, etc..
* The 2000 [[Bastille Day event]] coincided with exceptionally bright aurora.
* April 21, 2002, the [[Nozomi (probe)|Nozomi]] Mars Probe was hit by a large SEP event that caused large-scale failure.

'''Spatial contextual awareness''' consociates contextual information such as an individual's or sensor's location, activity, the time of day, and proximity to other people or objects and devices.&lt;ref name="Chen"&gt;Chen, Guanling, and David Kotz. 2000. A Survey of Context-Aware Mobile Computing Research. Dartmouth Computer Science Technical Report TR2000-381.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also defined as the relationship between and synthesis of information garnered from the spatial environment&lt;ref&gt; Hemakumara,  GPTS.  and  Rainis,  R.  2018.  Spatial  behaviour  modelling  of unauthorised housing in Colombo, Sri Lanka. KEMANUSIAAN  the  Asian  Journal  of  Humanities25(2): 91–107, https://doi.org/10.21315/kajh2018.25.2.5

Available from: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327864214_Spatial_Behaviour_Modelling_of_Unauthorised_Housing_in_Colombo_Sri_Lanka [accessed Sep 27 2018].&lt;/ref&gt;, a cognitive agent, and a cartographic map.  The spatial environment is the physical space in which the orientation or wayfinding task is to be conducted; the cognitive agent is the person or entity charged with completing a task; and the map is the representation of the environment which is used as a tool to complete the task.&lt;ref name="Freska"&gt;Freksa, Christian, Alexander Klippel, and Stephan Winter. 2005. A Cognitive Perspective on Spatial Context. Dagstuhl Seminar Proceedings 05491.&lt;/ref&gt;

An incomplete view of spatial contextual awareness would render it as simply a contributor to or an element of contextual awareness – that which specifies a point location on the earth.  This narrow definition omits the individual cognitive and computational functions involved in a complex geographic system.  Rather than defining the myriad of potential factors contributing to context, spatial contextual awareness defined in terms of cognitive processes permits a unique, user-centered perspective in which "conceptualizations imbue spatial structures with meaning."&lt;ref name="Freska"/&gt;

[[Context awareness]], geographic awareness, and ubiquitous cartography or Ubiquitous Geographic Information (UBGI) all contribute to the understanding of spatial contextual awareness.  They are also key elements in a map-based, [[location-based service]], or LBS.  In cases in which the user interface for the LBS is a map, cartographic design challenges must be addressed in order to effectively communicate the spatial context to the user.

Spatial contextual awareness can describe present context – the environment of the user at the present time and location, or that of a future context – where the user wants to go and what may be of interest to them in the approaching spatial environment.  Some location-based services are proactive systems which can anticipate future context.&lt;ref&gt;Mayrhofer, Rene, Harald Radi, and Alois Ferscha. 2003. Recognizing and Predicting Context by Learning from User Behavior. In ''The International Conference On Advances in Mobile Multimedia (MoMM2003)'', ed. W. Schreiner, G. Kotsis, A. Ferscha, and K. Ibrahim, volume 171, pages 25–35. Austrian Computer Society (OCG), September 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  Augmented reality is an application which guides a user through present and into future context by displaying spatial contextual information in their visual system as they traverse through real space.&lt;ref name="Gartner 2007a"&gt;Gartner, Georg. 2007a. Development of Multimedia – Mobile and Ubiquitous. In ''Multimedia Cartography'', ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 51-62. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous examples of LBS applications exist which require the ability to leverage spatial contextual awareness.  These applications are in demand by the general public and are examples of how maps are being used by individuals to help better understand the world and make daily decisions.&lt;ref name="Peterson 2007a"&gt;Peterson, Michael P. 2007a. Elements of Multimedia Cartography. In ''Multimedia Cartography'', ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 63-73. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context awareness==
[[Context awareness]] originated as a term from [[ubiquitous computing]] or as so-called pervasive computing which sought to deal with linking changes in the environment with computer systems, which are otherwise static.

Context is defined in multiple ways, most often with location as the cornerstone.  One source defines it as "location and the identity of nearby people and objects."   Another describes it as "location, identity, environment and time".&lt;ref name="Jiang"&gt;Jiang, Bin, and Xiaobai Yao. 2007. Location Based Services and GIS in Perspective.  In ''Location Based Services and TeleCartography'', ed. Georg Gartner, William Cartwright, and Michael P. Peterson, 27-45. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet some definitions recognize context awareness as being more inclusive than location.

Dey&lt;ref name="Dey"&gt;Dey, Anind K. 2001. Understanding and Using Context. ''Personal and Ubiquitous Computing'', Volume 5, 4-7. Springer London.&lt;/ref&gt; took this broader approach: "context is any information that can be used to characterize the situation of an entity, where entity means a person, place, or object, which is relevant to the interaction between a user and an application, including the user and the applications themselves."
The same author defined a system "to be context-aware if it uses context to provide relevant information and/or services to the user, in which the relevancy depends on the user's task".&lt;ref name="Dey"/&gt;

[[Image:Contextual Awareness Fig 1.png|thumb|upright=1.40|alt=Contextual Awareness Diagram|Figure 1:&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt; Contextual Awareness (Diagram after Li 2007)]]
The concept of relevancy is described in the following definition of context awareness: "the set of environmental states and settings that either determines an application's behavior or in which an application event occurs and is interesting to the user".&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt;  Different levels of context, in terms of low and high level have also been outlined.  Low-level contexts consist of time, location, network bandwidth and orientation.  A high-level context consists of the user's current activity and social context.&lt;ref name="Chen"/&gt;

A three-level model of context awareness (Figure 1) includes the changeable nature of the environment by differentiating between the contributions of static, dynamic, and internal context:&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;Li, Ki-Joune. 2007. Ubiquitous GIS, Part I: Basic Concepts of Ubiquitous GIS, Lecture Slides, Pusan National University.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Static context – stored digital geographic information which could impact the user's environment
* Dynamic context – information on the changeable aspects of the user's environment obtained by sensors/info services and provided in real time (e.g. weather forecasts, traffic reports)
* Internal context  – user information, to include personal preferences, location, speed, and orientation

Static content is driven by stored information while dynamic content is provided and updated by sensors.

Context categories for mobile maps have been identified through pilot user tests.  The categories in Table 1 were deemed useful for mobile map services:&lt;ref name="Nivala"/&gt;

==Geographic awareness==
[[Image:Spatial Contextual Awareness Fig 2.png|thumb|upright=1.40|alt=Spatial Contextual Awareness Diagram|Figure 2:&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt; Spatial Contextual (or Geographic) Awareness (Diagram after Li 2007)]]
Geographic awareness, another term for spatial contextual awareness, clarifies the spatial and geographic aspects of context.  Being more than simply present location, it must also include other dimensions and their interdependencies.  Figure 2 shows Li's&lt;ref name="Li"/&gt; components of context awareness and overlays them on multiple geographic reference systems.  To be effective, an LBS application must be able to operate in a heterogeneous space which includes different reference systems.  A user of a LBS must be able to seamlessly convert from a Euclidean space (Cartesian Reference Space), to a Linear Reference Space (LRS), to indoor space (to include perhaps the floor, wing, hallway, and room number).&lt;ref name="Hong"&gt;Hong, Sang-Ki, 2008. Ubiquitous Geographic Information (UBGI) and address standards. ISO Workshop on address standards: Considering the issues related to an international address standard. 25 May 2008. Copenhagen, Denmark.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ubiquitous geographic information (UBGI)/Ubiquitous cartography==
Ubiquitous geographic information (UBGI) is geographic information which is provided at any time and any place to users or systems through communication devices.  Critical to the understanding of UBGI is that the information provided is based on the context of the user.  UBGI is more than data.  It includes a set of concepts, practices and standards for spatial and geographic information and processing for applications accessible for use by the general public.&lt;ref name="Hong"/&gt;

UBGI must also take into account the situation and goals of the user, or cognitive agent.  For that purpose, ubiquitous computing concepts employ sensors to collect data on the user's location as well as environmental parameters.&lt;ref name="Freska"/&gt;

[[Image:GI Evolution Fig 3.png|thumb|upright=1.40|alt=Evolution of Geographic Information Diagram|Figure 3:&lt;ref name="Hong"/&gt; The Evolution of Geographic Information (Diagram after Hong 2008)]]
Ubiquitous cartography is "the ability for users to create and use maps in any place and at any time to resolve geospatial problems".&lt;ref name="Gartner 2007b"&gt;Gartner, Georg. 2007b. LBS and TeleCartography: About the book.  In ''Location Based Services and TeleCartography'', ed. Georg Gartner, William Cartwright, and Michael P. Peterson, 1-11. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  The users and creators of these maps are more than just highly trained geographers and cartographers, but include the average citizen.  In contrast to the accused elitism of the [[GIS]] community in the early 80's when many advocated for separate technology because geospatial information was different and unattainable to common users or systems, today's goal of ubiquity is to make the user experience with GIS-enabled devices intuitive and simple to use.&lt;ref name="Herring"&gt;Herring, John R. n.d. Ubiquitous Geographic Information: Releasing GI from Its Ivory Tower, Oracle Corporation.&lt;/ref&gt;  These devices and other multimedia cartography tools are playing a major role in the effort to get "maps out" to the general public and end the inexcusable practice of perfecting maps as a visualization form only for expert map users operating highly specialized [[Geographic Information Systems]].&lt;ref name="Peterson 2007a"/&gt;

The "ease-of-use" objective of ubiquitous cartography can be seen as the fourth generation in the evolution of geographic information.  UBGI was preceded by easily accessible of internet maps and the addition of contextual information of LBS and mobile mapping.  Digital geographic information was an essential precursor to accessible and mobile maps and these advancements are all an outgrowth of the first generation of paper maps and the effort to better represent and visualize the world (Fig. 3).&lt;ref name="Hong"/&gt;

==Location-based services (LBS)==
A [[location-based service]] (LBS) is an information and entertainment service, accessible with [[mobile devices]] through the [[mobile network]] and utilizing the ability to make use of the geographical position of the mobile device.

LBS services can be used in a variety of contexts, such as health, work, personal life, etc.  LBS services include services to identify a location of a person or object, such as discovering the nearest banking cash machine or the whereabouts of a friend or employee.  LBS services include parcel tracking and [[vehicle tracking]] services.  LBS can include [[mobile commerce]] when taking the form of coupons or advertising directed at customers based on their current location.  They include personalized weather services and even location-based games.  They are an example of [[telecommunication convergence]].

Location Based Services have the ability to exploit knowledge about the location of a user or an information device.  Whether the output of the device is a simple text message or an interactive graphic map, the user and the user's location are in some way incorporated into the overall system.&lt;ref name="Gartner 2007b"/&gt;

Other distinguishing characteristics of LBS include:&lt;ref name="Jiang"/&gt;
*Usually provide personalized services for a user on-the-move
*Based on diverse hardware and software platforms which utilize the internet, GIS, and location-aware devices and telecommunication services
*Receive data from various sources, sensors and systems
*Must integrate and process data in real-time
*Pose unique challenges for visualization due to the fact that the user's location could be constantly changing

LBS can be used to answer user questions which can be placed into four general categories: location, proximity, navigation, and events.  Examples include:&lt;ref name="Reichenbacher"&gt;Reichenbacher, Tumasch. 2001. The World in Your Pocket – Towards a Mobile Cartography. In Proceedings of the 20th International Cartographic Conference, August 6–10, Beijing, China, 4: 2514–2521.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Where am I?  Where is my destination?  [location]
*Where is the nearest bus stop or fast food restaurant?  [proximity]
*What is the best route to my destination?  [navigation]
*Is the latest movie showing at the local theater?  [events]

Another category is "measurement" to answer the question, how far away is my destination?&lt;ref name="Nivala"&gt;Nivala, Annu-Maaria, and L. Tiina Sarjakoski. 2003. Need for Context-Aware Topographic Maps in Mobile Devices, In ScanGIS'2003 -Proceedings of the 9th Scandinavian Research Conference on Geographical Information Science, June 4–6, Espoo, Finland.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a routine function of personal automobile navigation devices.

New, innovative ideas continue to add to the types of questions in which LBS can answer for a user.  For example, computer vision and object based indexing can be used to both identify an object and assist a user in navigating from the location.  Spatial contextual awareness plays a key role in this process as it provides an initial geo-reference of the location while simplifying the object recognition process to a manageable degree.&lt;ref name="Luley"&gt;Luley, Patrick, Lucas Paletta, Alexander Almer, Mathias Schardt, Josef Ringert, 2007. Geo-Services and Computer Vision for Object Awareness in Mobile System Applications. In ''Location Based Services and TeleCartography'', ed. Georg Gartner, William Cartwright, and Michael P. Peterson, 291-300. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  This category of LBS use can be called "identification" and answers the question "What is it?"

==Cartographic challenges==
Applications which require the use of spatial contextual awareness in LBS are confronted with a multitude of cartographic challenges and decisions.  Some of these challenges are due to the small displays of the typical PDA user interface and method of use.&lt;ref name="Peterson 2007b"&gt;Peterson, Michael P. 2007b. The Internet and Multimedia Cartography. In ''Multimedia Cartography'', ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 35-50. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other problems result from the large volume of potentially relevant contextual data as difficult choices need to be made on the most important content to display.&lt;ref name="Reichenbacher 2007b"&gt;Reichenbacher, Tumasch. 2007b. The concept of relevance in mobile maps. In Location Based Services and TeleCartography, ed. Georg Gartner, William Cartwright, and Michael P. Peterson, 231-246. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

A sampling of some of these challenges are:

*Mobility – A map on a mobile platform is changing quickly to keep up with context changes; limited time to view map information before a change in scene may be required.&lt;ref name="Reichenbacher 2007a"&gt;Reichenbacher, Tumasch. 2007a. Adaptation in mobile and ubiquitous cartography.  In Multimedia Cartography, ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 383-397. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Adaptation – Refers to "the ability of flexible systems to be changed by the user or the system in order to meet specific requirements."  Users must be able to personalize the display to present content adaptable to their sophistication and familiarity of the environment&lt;ref name="Reichenbacher 2007a"/&gt;
*Accessibility – "the matching of people's information and service needs with their needs and preferences in terms of intellectual and sensory engagement with that information or service, and control of it".&lt;ref name="Nevile"&gt;Nevile, Liddy, and Martin Ford. 2007. Location and Access: Issues Enabling Accessibility of Information.  In ''Multimedia Cartography'', ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 471-485. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  A service need could include a driver who cannot take their eyes off the road to study a map display; or a visitor in a foreign country who cannot understand the language of the audible cues of a LBS provider.
*Generalization – "Due to the very small display area of mobile devices mobile maps need to be extremely generalized."  The design should simple, concise and self-evident as possible and should be instantly usable.  "This means to lower the information density following the primacy of relevance over completeness"&lt;ref name="Reichenbacher 2007a"/&gt;
*Scaling – Map display is typically very small, requiring scaling functions to show enough area and information to be useful, but at a large enough scale to adequately show detail
*Relevance – "Presenting as much info as needed and as little as required".&lt;ref name="Reichenbacher 2007b"/&gt;  The information which is "needed" is the content which is effective for the particular spatial context of the user.
*Presentation Form – Multimedia maps provide several display medium options.  The option selected should be the one which best generates the user's mental map.  Besides the visual medium of a graphic map with representative symbols, textual and vocal presentations are options to consider.&lt;ref name="Gartner and Radoczy 2007"&gt;Gartner, Georg. and Verena Radoczky. 2007c.  Maps and LBS – Supporting wayfinding by cartographic means. In Multimedia Cartography, ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 369-382. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Visual Variables – Color is an appropriate primary graphic element when portraying different type or classes of qualitative features.&lt;ref name="Robinson et al 1995"&gt;Robinson, Arthur H., Joel L. Morrison, Phillip C. Muehrcke, A. Jon Kimerling, and Stephen C. Guptill. 1995. ''Elements of Cartography'', 381. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;  Color can contribute enormously to the usability of products as it assists in differentiating between different screen elements.&lt;ref&gt;Furey, Scott, and Kirk Mitchell. 2007. A Real-World implementation of Multimedia Cartography in LBS: The Whereis Mobile Application Suite. In Multimedia Cartography, ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 399-414. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;  High contrast, harmoniously matched colors need to be considered for quick perception and to reduce eye fatigue resulting from the radiant screen display&lt;ref&gt;Wintges, Theodor. 2005. Geodata Communication on Personal Digital Assistants (PDA). In ''Maps and the Internet'', ed. Michael P. Peterson, 397-402. Elsevier Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Metadata – Good metadata provides information to the user on the sources and quality of data being referenced to include reliability, accuracy, and authenticity.  More useful and higher quality metadata for multimedia applications is an omnipresent challenge.  International standards have been developed for geographic information, however, these "need to be extended and linked to information object metadata standards for photographs, videos, imagery, text, and other elements used by multimedia cartography".&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, D.R. Fraser, and Tracey P. Lauriault. 2007. Future Directions for Multimedia Cartography. In ''Multimedia Cartography'', ed. William Cartwright, Michael P. Peterson, and Georg Gartner, 505-522. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Navigation Views – The determination on best map views to aid user navigation.  Considerations include: overview maps available at various scales; automatic zoom to larger scale when user is in motion; maintain egocentric map position with north always marked.&lt;ref&gt;Radoczky, Verena. 2007. How to design a pedestrian navigation system for indoor and outdoor environments. In Location Based Services and TeleCartography, ed. Georg Gartner, William Cartwright, and Michael P. Peterson, 301-316. Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[music theory]], the '''spiral array model''' is an extended type of [[pitch space]]. A mathematical model involving concentric [[helices]] (an "array of [[spiral]]s"), it represents human perceptions of [[pitch (music)|pitch]]es, [[chord (music)|chord]]s and [[key (music)|key]]s in the same [[space|geometric space]]. It was proposed in 2000 by Prof. Elaine Chew in her MIT doctoral thesis ''Toward a Mathematical Model of [[Tonality]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |type=Ph.D. |last=Chew |first=Elaine |date=2000 |title=Towards a Mathematical Model of Tonality |publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology |url=http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/9139 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further research by Chew and others have produced modifications of the spiral array model, and, applied it to various problems in music theory and practice, such as key finding (symbolic and audio&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1521350 | title = Polyphonic Audio Key Finding Using the Spiral Array CEG Algorithm | last1 = Chuan | first1 = Ching-Hua | last2 = Chew | first2 = Elaine | date = 2005 | publisher = IEEE | book-title = Multimedia and Expo, 2005.

The spiral array model can be viewed as a generalized [[tonnetz]], which maps pitches into a two-dimensional lattice (array) structure. The spiral array wraps up the two-dimensional [[tonnetz]] into a three-dimensional lattice, and models higher order structures such as chords and keys in the interior of the lattice space. This allows the spiral array model to produce geometric interpretations of relationships between low- and high-level structures. For example, it is possible to model and measure geometrically the distance between a particular pitch and a particular key, both represented as points in the spiral array space. To preserve pitch spelling, because musically A# ≠ Bb in their function and usage, the spiral array does not assume [[enharmonic equivalence]], i.e. it does not fold into a torus. The spatial relationships between pitches, between chords, and between keys agree with those in other representations of tonal space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Chew | first = Elaine | date = 2008 | title = Out of the Grid and Into the Spiral: Geometric Interpretations of and Comparisons with the Spiral-Array Model | url = http://www.ccarh.org/publications/cm/15/cm15-04-chew.pdf | journal = Computing in Musicology | publisher = CCARH: Center for Computer Assisted Research in the Humanities at Stanford University | volume = 15 | pages = 51–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure of the Spiral Array==
[[File:Spiral Array Model—Nested Helices.png|thumb|Spiral Array Model. Pitch class, major/minor chord, and major/minor key helices.]]
The model as proposed covers basic pitches, major chords, minor chords, major keys and minor keys, represented on five concentric helices. Starting with a formulation of the pitch helix, inner helices are generated as [[convex combination]]s of points on outer ones. For example, the pitches C, E, and G are represented as the cartesian points ''P(0)'', ''P(1)'', and ''P(4)'' (see definitions in next section), which outline a triangle. The convex combination of these three points is a point inside the triangle, and represents their ''center of effect'' (''ce''). This interior point, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''M''&lt;/sub&gt;''(0)'', represents the C major chord in the spiral array model. Similarly, keys may be constructed by the centers of effect of their I, IV, and V chords.

# The outer helix represents pitches classes. Neighboring pitch classes are a music interval of a [[perfect fifth]], and spatially a quarter rotation, apart. The order of the pitch classes can be determined by the line of fifths. For example, C would be followed by G (C and G are a perfect fifth apart), which would be followed D (G and D are a perfect fifth apart), etc. As a result of this structure, and one of the important properties leading to its selection, vertical neighbors are a music interval of a [[major third]] apart. Thus, a pitch class's nearest neighbors and itself form perfect fifth and major third intervals.
# By taking every consecutive triads along the helix, and connecting their centers of effect, a second helix is formed inside the pitch helix, representing the major chords.
# Similarly, by taking the proper minor triads and connecting their centers of effect, a third helix is formed, representing the minor chords.
# The major key helix is formed by the centers of effect of the centers of effect of the I, IV, and V chords
# The minor key helix is formed by connecting similar combinations of the i, iv/IV, and V/v chords.

==Equations for Pitch, Chord, and Key Representations==
[[File:Spiral Array Model–Major Key Representation.png|thumb|Part of the Spiral Array Model by Elaine Chew. Generating of a major key representation as the center of effect of its I, IV, and V chords, which are in turn generated as the center of effect of their defining pitches.]]
[[File:Spiral Array Model—Minor Key Representation.png|thumb|Part of the Spiral Array Model by Elaine Chew. Generating of a minor key representation as the center of effect of its i, iv/IV, and V/v chords, which are in turn generated as the center of effect of their defining pitches.]]

The '''pitch class helix, P''', is represented in parametric form by:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P(k) = \begin{bmatrix}
x_{k} \\
y_{k} \\
z_{k} \\
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
r sin (k \cdot \pi / 2)\\
r cos (k \cdot \pi / 2) \\
kh
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where k is an integer representing the pitch's distance from C along the line of fifths, r is the radius of the spiral, and h is the "rise" of the spiral.

The '''major chord helix, C&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;''' is represented by:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_M(k) = w_1 \cdot P(k) + w_2 \cdot P(k + 1) + w_3 \cdot P(k+4)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;w_{1} \ge w_{2} \ge w_{3} &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^3 w_{i} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The weights "w" effect how close the center of effect are to the fundamental, major third, and perfect fifth of the chord. By changing the relative values of these weights, the spiral array model effects how "close" the resulting chord is to the three constituent pitches. Generally in western music, the fundamental is given the greatest weight in identifying the chord (w1), followed by the fifth (w2), followed by the third (w3).

The '''minor chord helix, C&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''' is represented by:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;C_m(k) = u_1 \cdot P(k) + u_2 \cdot P(k + 1) + u_3 \cdot P(k-3)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;u_1 \ge u_2 \ge u_3 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^3 u_i = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

The weights "u" function similarly to the major chord.

The '''major key helix, T&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;''' is represented by:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;T_M(k) = \omega_1 \cdot P(k) + \omega_2 \cdot P(k + 1) + \omega_3 \cdot P(k-1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\omega_1 \ge \omega_2 \ge \omega_3 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^3 \omega_i = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Similar to the weights controlling how close constituent pitches are to the center of effect of the chord they produce, the weights &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; control the relative effect of the I, IV, and V chord in determining how close they are to the resultant key.

The '''minor key helix, T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;''' is represented by:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;T_m(k) = \nu_1 \cdot C_M(k) + \nu_2 \cdot (\alpha \cdot C_M(k+1) + (1-\alpha) \cdot C_m(k+1)) + \nu_3 \cdot (\beta * C_m(k-1) + (1 - \beta) \cdot C_M(k-1)).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\nu_1 \ge \nu_2 \ge \nu_3 &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nu_1 + \nu_2 + \nu_3 = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0 \ge \alpha \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta \ge 1.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Without loss of generality]], red men (looking to the left) say ''no'', blue men (looking to the right) say ''yes''. The purple men can have either opinion.]]
The '''Sznajd model''' or '''United we stand, divided we fall''' ('''USDF''') model is an [[econophysics]] model suggested in 2000&lt;ref name=RefOriginal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sznajd-Weron|first1=Katarzyna|last2=Sznjad|first2=Jozef|title=Opinion evolution in closed community|journal=International Journal of Modern Physics C|volume=11|issue=06|pages=1157–1165|doi=10.1142/S0129183100000936|arxiv=cond-mat/0101130|bibcode=2000IJMPC..11.1157S}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced to gain fundamental understanding about opinion dynamics using methods from [[statistical physics]]. The Sznajd model implements a phenomenon called [[social validation]] and thus extends the [[Ising spin model]]. In simple words, the model states:
* '''Social validation''': If two people share the same opinion, their neighbors will start to agree with them.
* '''Discord destroys''': If a block of adjacent persons disagree, their neighbors start to argue with them.
{{Statistical mechanics|cTopic=Models}}

== Mathematical formulation ==
For simplicity, one assumes that each individual&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; has
an opinion S&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; which might be [[Boolean network|Boolean]] (&lt;math&gt;S_i=-1&lt;/math&gt; for ''no'', &lt;math&gt;S_i=1&lt;/math&gt; for ''yes'')  in its simplest formulation, which means that each individual either agrees or disagrees to a given question.

In the original 1D-formulation, each individual has exactly two neighbors just like beads on a [[bracelet]]. At each time step a pair of individual &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; is chosen at random to change their nearest neighbors' opinion (or: [[Ising spin]]s) &lt;math&gt;S_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+2}&lt;/math&gt; according to two dynamical rules:
# If &lt;math&gt;S_i=S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;S_{i-1}=S_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+2}=S_i&lt;/math&gt;. This models '''social validation''', if two people share the same opinion, their neighbors will change their opinion.
# If &lt;math&gt;S_i=-S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;S_{i-1}=S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+2}=S_i&lt;/math&gt;. Intuitively: If the given pair of people disagrees, both adopt the opinion of their other neighbor.

=== Findings for the original formulations ===
In a closed (1 dimensional) community, two [[steady state]]s are always reached, namely complete consensus (which is called ''[[ferromagnetic]] state'' in physics) or [[stalemate]] (the ''[[antiferromagnetic]] state'').
Furthermore, [[Monte Carlo simulations]] showed that these simple rules lead to complicated dynamics, in particular to a [[power law]] in the decision time distribution with an exponent of -1.5.&lt;ref name=RefApplications&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sznajd-Weron|first1=Katarzyna|title=Sznajd model and its applications|journal=Acta Physica Polonica B|date=2005|volume=36|issue=8|arxiv=physics/0503239|bibcode=2005AcPPB..36.2537S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modifications ===
The final (antiferromagnetic) state of alternating all-on and all-off is unrealistic to represent the behavior of a community. It would mean that the complete population uniformly changes their opinion from one time step to the next. For this reason an alternative  dynamical rule was proposed. One possibility is that two spins &lt;math&gt;S_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; change their nearest neighbors according to the two following rules:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Sanchez|first1=Juan R.|title=A modified one-dimensional Sznajd model|arxiv=cond-mat/0408518}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# '''Social validation''' remains unchanged: If &lt;math&gt;S_i=S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;S_{i-1}=S_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+2}=S_{i}&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;S_i=-S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;S_{i-1}=S_{i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_{i+2}=S_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt;

== Relevance ==
In recent years, [[statistical physics]] has been accepted as modeling framework for phenomena outside the traditional physics. Fields as [[econophysics]] or [[sociophysics]] formed, and many [[quantitative analyst]]s in [[finance]] are physicists. The [[Ising model]] in statistical physics has been a very important step in the history of studying [[Critical phenomena|collective (critical) phenomena]]. The Sznajd model is a simple but yet important variation of prototypical Ising system.&lt;ref name=RefSocialPhysics&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Castellano|first1=Claudio|last2=Fortunato|first2=Santo|last3=Loreto|first3=Vittorio|title=Statistical physics of social dynamics|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|arxiv=0710.3256|volume=81|issue=2|pages=591–646|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.81.591|bibcode=2009RvMP...81..591C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Katarzyna Sznajd-Weron has been recognized by the [[Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft#Young Scientist Award for Socio- and Econophysics|Young Scientist Award for Socio- and Econophysics]] of the [[Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft]] (German Physical Society) for an outstanding original contribution using physical methods to develop a better understanding of socio-economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Young Scientist Award for Socio- and Econophysics|url=http://www.dpg-physik.de/dpg/gliederung/fv/soe/YSA/preistraeger_YSA.html|publisher=Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft|accessdate=15 October 2014|location=Bad Honnef, Germany}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applications ===
The Sznajd model belongs to the class of '''binary-state dynamics on a networks''' also referred to as [[Boolean network]]s. This class of systems includes the [[Ising model]], the [[voter model]] and the [[q-voter model]], the [[Bass diffusion model]], [[threshold model]]s and others.&lt;ref name=RefBinaryStateDynamics&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gleeson|first1=James P.|title=Binary-State Dynamics on Complex Networks: Pair Approximation and Beyond|journal=Physical Review X|volume=3|issue=2|doi=10.1103/PhysRevX.3.021004|arxiv=1209.2983|bibcode=2013PhRvX...3b1004G}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Sznajd model can be applied to various fields:
* The [[finance]] interpretation considers the spin-state &lt;math&gt;S_i=1&lt;/math&gt; as a bullish trader placing orders, whereas a &lt;math&gt;S_i=0&lt;/math&gt; would correspond to a trader who is bearish and places sell orders.

{{nihongo|'''Institute for Research in Humanities, Kyoto University'''|京都大学人文科学研究所|Kyōto Daigaku Jinbun Kagaku Kenkyūjo}} is an institution for research into the humanities and ethno-ecological studies. It has a distinctive school tradition, as heir to the philosophically-oriented [[Kyoto School]], but differs from the latter in its broader cultural interests.&lt;ref&gt;Much of this article will be translated from the equivalent article [[:ja:京都大学人文科学研究所]], in the Japanese Wikipedia, as retrieved on June 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==

A dark fairytale combining the drama of modern horror with classic elements of Gothic imagery inspired by the German Expressionist films of the 1920s.

A young artist, Lucy Snow, struggles bravely to cope with more than one grief; the plight of her seriously ill mother, and her own faltering talents as a painter.

Her dreams become haunted by a shadowy figure, the mythical Travelling Artist. This lonely wanderer, it’s whispered, has roamed the world for over a century in pursuit of his creative visions. Can such a man exist? And if he does, will his powers be able to rescue Lucy from sadness and what form will salvation take?

== Cast ==

* Holly- Marie Laurence as Lucy Snow
* Simon Baker as The Travelling Artist
* Poppy Flanagan as Lucy's mother
* Martine Sherlock as Eliza Rose

== Influences ==

''The Travelling Artist'' is a modern take on classic German expressionist films including ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari|The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari]]'' (1920), ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927), and ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922).

The '''Vermont State Colleges''' (VSC) is the U.S. state of [[Vermont|Vermont's]] system of [[University system|public colleges]]. It functions as a [[governance]] organization, and was created by act of the [[Vermont General Assembly]] in 1961. There are presently four colleges in the VSC consortium, they are: [[Castleton University]], [[Community College of Vermont]], [[Northern Vermont University]], and the [[Vermont Technical College]]. Together, more than 13,000 students are enrolled in the colleges of the VSC.

While VSC, the state colleges' governing organization, was created in the mid-20th century, most of the component colleges are older. The state legislature first chartered Castleton University as a grammar school in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castleton.edu/about-castleton/our-campus/ Our Campus]. Castleton.edu. Retrieved on 2017-01-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson State College was founded in 1828. The Vermont Technical College was founded in 1866. Lyndon State College was founded in 1911. Community College of Vermont, founded in 1970, was founded after the creation of the VSC. The newest institution, Northern Vermont University, was created in 2018 by merging Johnson State College and Lyndon State College together, combining administration but keeping the campuses separate.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sevendaysvt.com/OffMessage/archives/2016/11/29/coming-soon-northern-vermont-university-johnson-and-lyndon&lt;/ref&gt;

The VSC was headquartered at the Chancellors Office in [[Waterbury, Vermont|Waterbury]] until August 2011 when [[Tropical Storm Irene]] forced it to relocate temporarily. After one year of temporary location at the Vermont Tech Enterprise Center in [[Randolph, Vermont|Randolph]], the Chancellor's Office found a new, permanent home in [[Montpelier, Vermont|Montpelier]].

The Chancellor's office is a directorate performing day to day financial and policy operations. It is headed by the chancellor, and three vice presidents. Each of the state colleges has its own president and deans. A [[Council of Presidents]], made up of the constituent colleges' presidents, VSC chancellor, and VSC vice presidents serves as an executive leadership team. The Council of Presidents works with the fifteen member Board of Trustees, to set policies and procedures. The [[Governor of Vermont]] serves as an [[Ex-officio member|''ex officio'' member]] of the board.

Almost sixty percent of VSC students come from the state of Vermont. Approximately forty percent come from over forty other U.S. states, and more than forty-five countries. Class size is small, the average faculty to student ratio across the five colleges is 1:16. Nearly ninety percent of the faculty hold a Ph.D. or equivalent doctorate level terminal degree in their field of instruction.
