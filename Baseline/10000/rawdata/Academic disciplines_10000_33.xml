      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1575">An '''active chromatin sequence''' (ACS) is a region of [[DNA]] in a [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[chromosome]] in which [[histone]] modifications such as [[acetylation]] lead to exposure of the [[DNA sequence]] thus allowing binding of [[transcription factors]] and [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] to take place. Active chromatin may also be called [[euchromatin]]. ACSs may occur in non-expressed gene regions which are assumed to be "poised" for [[gene transcription|transcription]]. The sequence once exposed often contains a promoter to began transcription. At this site [[acetylation]] or [[methylation]] can take place causing a conformational change to the chromatin. At the active chromatin sequence site deacetylation can caused the gene to be repressed if not being expressed.

==Introduction==
[[Adipocytes]] play a vital role in energy homeostasis and process the largest energy reserve as [[triglycerol]] in the body of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cornelius|first=P|author2=MacDougald, OA|author3=Lane, MD|title=Regulation of adipocyte development.|journal=Annual Review of Nutrition|year=1994|volume=14|pages=99–129|doi=10.1146/annurev.nu.14.070194.000531|pmid=7946535|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.nu.14.070194.000531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adipocytes stay in a dynamic state, they start expanding when the energy intake is higher than the expenditure and undergo mobilization when the energy expenditure exceeds the intake. This process is highly regulated by counter regulatory hormones to which these cells are very sensitive. The hormone [[insulin]] promotes expansion whereas the counter hormones [[epinephrine]], [[glucagon]],and 
[[ACTH]] promote mobilization. Adipogenesis is a tightly regulated cellular differentiation process, in which the preadipocytes are transformed into differentiated adipocyte cells. Comparing with cells from other lineage, the in vitro differentiation of fat cells is authentic and recapitulates most of the characteristic feature of in vivo adipogenesis. The key features of differentiated adipocytes are morphological change, growth arrest, high expression of lipogenic genes and production of hormones like [[leptin]], [[resistin]] (in the mouse, not in humans) and [[TNF-alpha]].

{{italictitle}}
'''''Antidosis''''' ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἀντίδοσις}}), is the title of a speech treatise by the ancient Greek [[rhetoric]]ian, [[Isocrates]].  The ''Antidosis'' can be viewed as a defense, an [[autobiography]], or rhetorical treatise. However, since Isocrates wrote it when he was 82 years old, it is generally seen by some people as an autobiography.  The title literally translates as “an exchange,” and was applied in ancient [[Greece|Greek]] courts as a peculiar law pertaining to an exchange of estates between two parties.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.stoa.org/projects/demos/article_law_glossary?page=5&amp;greekEncoding= ''Antidosis'' as an Ancient Athenian legal term]&lt;/ref&gt;  If one of the 1200 wealthiest Athenians eligible was tasked with the performance of a public liturgy and financing one of the many public concerns of [[Athens]], then he could avoid the duty by nominating a richer man who was more qualified than himself to perform it.  If the supposedly richer man disagreed with the terms, then the entirety of their estates would be exchanged and the now more wealthy man would have to perform the [[liturgy]], as originally planned.  The law inspired Isocrates' ''Antidosis'', which was written in the form of a [[Legal case|court case]] where Isocrates had to defend himself from a charge of corrupting the youth by teaching them how to speak well in order for them to gain an unfair advantage over their peers.  Although this work is put forward by Isocrates as his imagined defense in a legal case, it is more a treatise on [[morality]] and teaching.

== As a Court Case ==
Although it is assumed that he is defending himself from a charge of corrupting the youth, nowhere in his Antidosis does Isocrates mention what [[crime]] he is charged with and from which he must defend, nor does it say what the penalty would be for being found guilty.  Isocrates also does not make any attempt to offer evidence in his favor, yet presents the defense that he is a good [[teacher]] to his students as the full defense for the crime that he has committed.  There is no specific mention of anything that would prove him innocent in this particular case.

Another idea by scholars is that early on in the ''Antidosis'', Isocrates reads aloud that he is being indicted for corrupting his students.  He is accused of educating his students to speak against the courts, question the laws, and think for themselves.  Isocrates says, “Here is the indictment my accuser endeavors to vilify me, charging that I corrupt young men by teaching them to speak and gain their won advantage in the courts contrary to justice…”&lt;ref&gt;Isocrates. The Antidosis. Harvard: Harvard UP, 1929. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Isocrates is being charged by Lysimachus who has accused Isocrates of receiving money from his students.  In return, Isocrates has been teaching them how to become better public speakers and leaders.  Isocrates proves his innocence by showing, that through teaching his students rhetoric, he is teaching them how to become better citizens and leaders of Athens.  Isocrates proved his rationale by citing the accomplishments and devotion to the state his students displayed after being educated by him.  Isocrates says in his defense, “But, I beg of you, consider well whether I appear to you to corrupt the young by my words, or, on the contrary, to inspire them to a life of valor and of dangers endured for their country…”&lt;ref&gt;Isocrates. The Antidosis. Harvard: Harvard UP, 1929. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  B. Keith Murphy says of Isocrates’s defense, “For Isocrates, it is through rhetoric that we can approximate truth, or at least a consensual truth. A man who is trained in rhetoric is trained in truth, and the creation of that truth through oratory.”&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, B. Keith. "Isocrates." Salem Press, 1998. Web. 29 Apr 2011. &lt;http://www.keithmurphy.info/399/Isoc.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the sense that he is defending himself from an onerous charge to perform a liturgy, Isocrates makes a claim that his value to the city was provided through his teaching.  He states that as a lifelong teacher, the value of the [[education]] that he has provided for students is worth far more than any monetary donation he can give to Athens.  His teaching has provided for civic-minded and properly educated [[Citizenship|citizen]]s that contribute to the orderly running of the city-state.  For Isocrates to be sentenced to death would be to ignore the public service that he has performed for the city, by which he has devoted his life to giving its citizens a proper rhetorical education.

== As an Autobiography ==
Isocrates was 82 years old at the time he wrote ''Antidosis'', the longest work of his life.  Antidosis is used by the author to depict himself as a model citizen and a contributor to the city-state of Athens.  Since he was nearing the end of his life, he presumably would have wanted to leave behind a legacy of a devoted and moderate citizen to his home town and to justify his life as a service to Athens and the citizens to whom he taught rhetoric.  Isocrates presents himself as a quiet citizen who avoids the public light, where [[Public speaking|oratory]] is used in a way to bring many different cases of [[Lawsuit|litigation]] against each other - which the elite believed to negatively affect the way in which the [[republic]] was run.  He tries to withdraw himself from the public interfering and intrusive efforts made into [[Democracy|democratic]] politics.

The ''Antidosis'' is not seen by some as an autobiography of Isocrates; it was written later in his life as a fictionalized story similar to his own court trial.  While there are similarities between Isocrates’s real court case and the one in the ''Antidosis'', many aspects of the case were fictionalized.  Examples are Lysimachus being the person who has brought Isocrates to trial for this crime, and the crime being different from the one with which he was actually accused.  According to George Norlin, “At any rate, in the ''Antidosis''-a title which he borrows from the actual suit to which he had just been subjected-he adopts the fiction of a capital charge brought against him by an informer named Lysimachus, and of a trial before a court with its accessories.”&lt;ref&gt;Norlin, George. The Antidosis. Harvard: Harvard UP, 1929. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  

It is known that in his own life Isocrates did in fact go to court in his own defense over an amount of money he was made to pay.  Isocrates argued this fine was based on the fact people thought he was wealthier than he actually was.  He claimed this distorted perception of his wealth was due to his popularity as a public figure.  This is similar to Isocrates’s defense in the ''Antidosis'' in which he claims he has been indicted due to the fact he is a very successful person, people are jealous of him, and people want to publicly embarrass him.  In the ''Antidosis'', Isocrates is charged with corrupting the youth by teaching them to become good public speakers.  With this ability, the students may trick people by convincing them of false truths which could ultimately allow the students to corrupt the government.  This is an obvious defense of his life’s work of teaching.

==As a Rhetorical Treatise==
Isocrates states that the teacher should be judged by his students, in that if they do good and moral works then the teacher has done a good job and should be [[praise]]d.  This directly opposes [[Gorgias]]’ view that it is not up to him how his students use what he teaches them.  

At the end of his Antidosis, Isocrates explains how he attempts to keep his students in high moral standing by discouraging some of the more debaucherous behaviors available in the city, such as “participating in drinking-bouts and [[Gambling|tossing dice]] in gambling dens.”  He posits the idea that as a teacher, he can be judged as successful by the moral ways in which his students live their lives when compared to other young men who are wasting their youth in revelry. Hence he agrees to submit to the punishment if any of his students can be shown to be bad influences on [[society]] and challenges his accuser to present even one student who could be said to belong to the group of degenerate youth.

Another important topic is natural talent. Isocrates argues that native ability is necessary for becoming a good orator, along with a proper education on the subject and practical experience.

==Commentary==
D. S. Hutchinson and Monte Johnson (2010) pointed out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.protrepticus.info/2011/06/antidosis-and-protrepticus.html|title=Antidosis and Protrepticus|year=2011|authors=D. S. Hutchinson and Monte Ransome Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Aristotle’s Protrepticus was written in the late 350s in polemical response to a work by the Athenian philosopher and teacher Isocrates called the Antidosis. In this work, Isocrates contested the application of the word philosophy to the kind of abstract and speculative mathematical preoccupations current in Plato’s Academy. For him, education and philosophy meant training men to become effective political leaders, and the means to this was training in rhetoric. Speculation about advanced mathematics, astronomy, and the “elements” or “principles” of nature were useful as “mental gymnastic” for the young but, according to the argument, in adulthood become distractions from the important business of military, political, and legal action. In the Protrepticus, Aristotle responded to Isocrates’ attack on Academic philosophy by defending the search for the elements and principles of nature as the best means not only for political science, but for every other goal in life as well.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2218">'''Automatic box-opening technology''' refers to the process of automatically opening boxes on a [[conveyor]] or other "pass through" environment. The process was invented due to a gap in [[automation]] technology that exists in large [[distribution center]]s and [[warehouse]]s. This trend has continued to develop as some manufacturing companies have gone overseas and leaving United States more as a [[mass distribution]] network rather than a manufacturer.

Conveyors, [[in-motion scale]]s, sorting equipment, and high visibility [[Computer software|software]] have contributed to automation of distribution center for years. However, the simple process of opening a box has safety issues and Automatic Box Cutters reduce high labor costs, processing over 500 boxes an hour.&lt;ref name=cornerstoneautosys&gt;[http://www.cornerstoneautosys.com/abot/ ABOT-ONE and ABOT-DUO | Automatic Box Opener, Carton Slitter, Case Cutter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Such ''Automatic Box Cutting Technology'' is able to perform the work of up to 8 people by fully automating the box opening process, with only requiring manual interaction when changing cutting blades.&lt;ref name=dcvelocity&gt;[http://www.dcvelocity.com/products/?product_id=620 New options for ABOT-DUO box opener line – Products and Services – DC Velocity&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This technology is able to increase overall efficiency through the entire [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]] operation.&lt;ref name=findarticles&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4374/is_200701/ai_n18925174 Automatic box opener. | Material Handling Management] BNET.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Biblical Archaeological Institute''' Wuppertal (BAI) was established in 1999 by the [[Protestant Church]] of the [[Rhineland]].
It constitutes an institute of the “Protestant University of Wuppertal” as well as an associated institute of the [[University of Wuppertal]] and holds the right to award doctorates at both universities.

The necessary [[financial endowment]] is provided by the “Friends of the BAI” (e.V.).

== Scientific aims==

Since 1999 four main objectives of research are being pursued. These comprehend:
* Excavation projects (especially in the Eastern Mediterranean)
* The application of modern methods in Archaeology - i.e. [[Geophysics]] ([[geoelectrics]] and [[tomography]]; [[geomagnetics]]; [[georadar]]) and terrestrial research ([[Photogrammetry]])
* [[Archaeometry]] (chemical and mineralogical pottery analysis; experimental firing of pottery); the main interest is to write a history of pottery production in the investigation area; since 2008 also research work on ancient glass and faience industry
* [[Experimental archaeology]] (Production of pottery replicas in historically correct manufacturing methods)

== Main archaeological projects==

=== Different projects ===

The Biblical Archaeological Institute has conducted excavations and geophysical research  in [[Italy]], [[Greece]], [[Israel]] and the Hashemite Kingdom of [[Jordan]].

* [[Villa Hadriana]] (Italy) 2002–2004
* Geophysical prospection in [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] (Greece) 2001
* Esch-Schallaf (Jordan) 1998–1999
* Ba'ja I, close to [[Petra]] (Jordan) 1999
* Sal (Jordan) 1999–2000

=== The Gadara Region Project and the Tall Zira'a ===

Since 2001 the institute's research focuses on the exploration of the Gadara region. The largest site in the area is the [[Tall Zira'a]] which comprises over 5000 years of settlement history.
At this place in 2001 a survey was conducted. In 2003 started the first excavation of a long term project which is scheduled until 2020. 
Since 2004 the [[German Protestant Institute of Archaeology]] [[Amman]] is a partner of the project. Since 2006 the corresponding institute in [[Jerusalem]] participates likewise.
The currently running excavation seasons are accomplished by a regional survey covering the greater Wadi al-'Arab area since 2009.

On the Tall Zira'a settlements from over more than five millennia are being excavated. Furthermore, the agricultural potential as well as flora and fauna, geology, hydrology, trade relations (roads, infrastructure) and the strategically importance of the Wadi al-Arab are being explored.

25&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the greater Wadi al-'Arab area (south of the ancient city of [[Gadara]]) were under research since 2009. In this area exist more than 100 sites which date from prehistory to the Islamic period.

With the help of archaeometrical methods the [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] from the Tall Zira'a are being examined concerning their respective materials. Thereby, the research concentrates on [[Pottery#Archaeology|pottery]], glass and [[faience]] to gain insight into the possible location of production sites and the technological knowledge.

The research described above goes hand in hand with [[experimental archaeology]], applying old techniques e.&amp;nbsp;g. of constructing a potters oven and firing the products.

The geophysical prospection of the Tall Zira'a used geoelectrical mapping, two-dimensional tomography and three-dimensional tomographical techniques to

* plan archaeological excavations in advance as exact as possible and devise appropriate methods of excavation,
* acquire knowledge concerning unexcavated areas and
* protect areas for future excavations.

== Director ==
[[Image:BAI-Wuppertal Uni Campus Freudenberg.JPG|thumb| BAI at Wuppertal University 2008]]

The first Director of the Biblical Archaeological Institute is [[Dieter Vieweger]] who was appointed in 1999. Since November 2005 he is also the Director of the [[German Protestant Institute of Archaeology]] in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Amman]]. He is professor at the Protestant University of Wuppertal as well as at the [[Witten/Herdecke University]].

== Location University of Wuppertal (Bergische Universität Wuppertal) ==

On 13 July 2003 the move-in of the BAI in the facilities of the Bergische Universität, Campus Freudenberg was ceremonially solemnized. The stuff of the BAI is mainly concerned with the archaeological research of the finds from the Tall Zira´a.

The BAI on the Campus Freudenberg of the Bergische Universität Wuppertal can easily be reached by car via A 1, A 46 and L 418. Public transport is being provided from Wuppertal central station by Bus "E". 
The institute is located on the 3rd floor of building FD.

{{Anthropology of art|Basic}}

'''Body culture studies''' describe and compare bodily practice in the larger context of [[culture]] and [[society]], i.e. in the tradition of [[anthropology]], [[history]] and [[sociology]]. As body culture studies analyse culture and society in terms of human bodily practices, they are sometimes viewed as a form of [[materialist]] [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].
The significance of the body and of body culture (in German ''Körperkultur'', in Danish ''kropskultur'') was discovered since the early twentieth century by several historians and sociologists. During the 1980s, a particular school of body culture studies spread, in connection with – and critically related to – [[sport]]s studies. Body culture studies were especially established at Danish universities and academies and cooperated with Nordic, European and East Asian research networks.

Body culture studies include studies of [[dance]], play ([[play (activity)]]) and [[game]], outdoor activities, festivities and other forms of movement culture. The field of body culture studies is floating towards studies of medical cultures, of working habits, of [[gender]] and sexual cultures, of [[fashion]] and [[body decoration]], of popular [[festivity]] and more generally towards [[popular culture]] studies.

Body culture studies have shown useful by making the study of sport enter into broader historical and sociological discussion – from the level of subjectivity to civil society, state and market.

== Earlier studies in body and culture ==

Since early 20th century, sociologists and philosophers had discovered the significance of the body, especially [[Norbert Elias]], the [[Frankfurt School]], and some phenomenologists. Later, [[Michel Foucault]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and the Stuttgart [[Historical Behaviour Studies]] delivered important inspirations for the new body culture studies.

The sociologist Norbert Elias (1939) wrote the first sociology, which placed the body and bodily practice in its centre, describing the change of table manners, shame and violence from the Middle Ages to Early Modern court society as a process of civilisation. Later, Elias (1989) studied the culture of duel in Wilhelminian Prussia, throwing light on particular traits of the German [[sonderweg]]. Elias' figurational sociology of the body became productive especially in the field of sport studies (Elias/ Dunning 1986; [[Eric Dunning]] et al. 2004). His concept of the "process of civilisation" received, however, also critique from the side of comparative [[anthropology]] of bodily practices (Duerr 1988/2005).

The [[Frankfurt School]] of [[Critical Theory]] turned towards the body with [[Marxist]] and [[Freudian]] perspectives. [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]] (1947) described the Western "[[dialectics]] of [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]" as including an underground history of the body. Body history lead from the living body to the dead body becoming a commodity under [[capitalism]]. A younger generation of the Frankfurt School launched the [[Neo-Marxist]] sports critique (Rigauer 1969) and developed alternative approaches to movement studies and movement culture (Lippe 1974; Moegling 1988). Historical studies about the body in industrial work (Rabinbach 1992), in transportation (Schivelbusch 1977), and in [[Fascist]] aesthetics ([[Theweleit]] 1977) as well as in the philosophy of [[space]] ([[Peter Sloterdijk]] 1998/ 2004) had their roots in this critical approach.

Philosophical phenomenology (→[[Phenomenology (philosophy)]]) paid attention to the body, too. [[Helmuth Plessner]] (1941) studied laughter and weeping as fundamental human expressions. [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] (1945) placed the body in the centre of human existence, as a way of experiencing the world, challenging the traditional body-mind dualism of [[René Descartes]]. [[Gaston Bachelard]] (1938) approached bodily existence via a phenomenology of the elements and of space, starting by "[[psychoanalysis]] of fire".

Based on phenomenological traditions, [[Michel Foucault]] (1975) studied the configurations of knowledge in the post-1800 society, launching the concept of modern panoptical control (→[[Panopticon]]). The body appeared as object of military discipline and of the panopticon as a mechanism of "the biopolitics of power". Foucault's approach became especially influential for studies in sport, space, and architecture (Vertinsky/ Bale 2004) as well as for studies in the discipline of [[gymnastic]] and sport ([[Vigarello]] 1978; Barreau/ Morne 1984; Vertinsky/ McKay 2004).

While Foucault's studies focused on top-down strategies of power, [[Pierre Bourdieu]] directed his attention more towards bottom-up processes of social-bodily practice. For analysing the class aspect of the body, Bourdieu (1966/67) developed the influential concept of habitus as an incorporated pattern becoming social practice by diverse forms of taste, distinction and display of the body. Some of Bourdieu's disciples applied these concepts to the study of sports and gymnastics (Defrance 1987).

In Germany, influences of phenomenology induced body culture studies in the historical field. The Stuttgart school of [[Historical Behaviour Studies]] focused from 1971 on [[gestures]] and laughter, [[martial arts]], sport and dance to analyze changes of society and differences between European and non-European cultures (Nitschke 1975, 1981, 1987, 1989, 2009; [[Henning Eichberg]] 1978).

These approaches met with tendencies of the late 1970s and 1980s, when [[humanities]] and [[sociology]] developed a new and broader interest in the body. Sociologists, historians, philosophers and anthropologists, scholars from sport studies and from medical studies met in talking about "the return of the body" or its "reappearance" (Kamper/ Wulf 1982). The new interest towards the body was soon followed up by the term "body culture" itself.

== The word and concept of "body culture" – alternative practice ==

The word "body culture" appeared for first time around 1900, but at that time signifying a certain form of physical practice. The so-called "life reform" (German ''[[Lebensreform]]'') aimed at the reform of clothing and of nurture and favoured new bodily activities, which constituted a new sector side by side with established gymnastics and sport. The main fields of this third sector of movement culture were [[nudism]], rhythmic-expressive gymnastics, [[yoga]] and [[body building]] (Wedemeyer-Kolwe 2004) as well as a new type of youth wandering. Though highly diverse, they found a comprehensive term in the German word ''Körperkultur'', in English [[physical culture]] (→[[physical education]]), in French ''culture physique'', and in Danish ''kropskultur''. Inspirations from the movement of body culture gave birth to early studies in the history of bodily positions and movements (Gaulhofer 1930; [[Marcel Mauss]] 1934).

In German Socialist workers' sport, the concept of ''Körperkultur'' had a prominent place. The concept also entered into Russian [[Socialism]] where ''fiskultura'' became an alternative to [[bourgeois]] sport, uniting the revolutionary fractions of more aesthetical ''[[Proletkult]]'' and more health-oriented "hygienism" (Riordan 1977). Later, [[Stalinism]] forced the contradictory terms under the formula "sport and body culture". This continued in the [[Soviet bloc]] after 1945.
When the 1968 [[student movement]] revived Marxism, the concept of body culture – ''Körperkultur'' in West Germany, "somatic culture" in America – re-entered into the sports-critical discourse, but received new analytical dimensions. ''Quel corps?'' (Which body?) was the title of a critical review of sports, edited by the French Marxist [[educationalist]] [[Jean-Marie Brohm]] in 1975-1997. In Germany, a series of books under the title ''Sport: Kultur, Veränderung'' (Sport: culture, change) marked the body cultural turn from 1981, with works of Rigauer, Elias, Eichberg and others.

== Body culture studies – a new critical school ==

In Denmark, a particular school of Body Culture Studies – ''kropskultur'' – developed since around 1980 in connection with the critique of sport (Korsgaard 1982; Eichberg 1998; Vestergård 2003; Nielsen 1993 and 2005). It had its background in Danish popular gymnastics and in alternative movement practices – outdoor activities, play and game, dance, [[meditation]]. In Finland, the concept ''ruumiinkulttuuri'' found a similar attention (Sironen 1995; Sparkes/ Silvennoinen 1999).

In international cooperation, "body anthropology" became the keyword for French, Danish and German philosophers, sociologists and educationalists who founded the ''Institut International d'Anthropologie Corporelle (IIAC)'' in 1987. They undertook case studies in traditional [[game]]s as well as in "scenes" of new urban body cultures (Barreau/ Morne 1984; Barreau/ Jaouen 1998; Dietrich 2001 and 2002).

Body culture studies found a particular interest in East Asian countries. In Japan, the sociologist Satoshi Shimizu from the University of Tsukuba established in 2002 a ''Centre for the Study of Body Culture'', publishing the review ''Gendai Sports Hyôron'' (Contemporary Sport Critique, in Japanese, since 1999). In Taiwan, Hsu I-hsiung from the National Taiwan Normal University founded in 2003 the ''Taiwan Body Culture Society'' (Taiwan shenti wenhua xiehui), publishing the reviews ''Sport Studies'' (in Chinese, since 2007) and ''Body Culture Journal'' (in Chinese, since 2005). And in Korea, Jong Young Lee from the University of Suwon published since 2004 the ''International Journal of Eastern Sport &amp; Physical Education'', focusing on body culture and traditional games.

These initiatives were connected with each other both by contents and by personal networks. In the English and American world, Allen Guttmann (1978, 1996, 2004), [[John Hoberman]] (1984), John Bale (1996, 2002, 2004), Susan Brownell (1995, 2008) and Patricia Vertinsky (2004) contributed by opening the history, sociology and geography of sports towards body culture studies.

While the concept of body culture earlier had denoted an alternative practice and was used in singular, it became now an analytical category describing body cultures in plural. The terms of physical culture (or [[physical education]]) and body culture separated – the first describing a practice, the second a subject of theoretical analysis.

== Questioning the "individual" body ==

Studies in body culture have shown that bodily existence is more than just "the body" as being an individual skin bag under control of an individual mind. Bodily practice happens between the different bodies. This questions current types of thinking "the [[individual]]": the [[epistemological]] [[individualism]] and the thesis of '[[Modern history#Late modern period|late-modern]] [[individualism|individualization]]'.

The methodological habit of counter-posing "the individual" and "the society" is largely disseminated in sociology. It was fundamentally criticized by [[Norbert Elias]] who underlined that there was no meaning in the separation between the individual as a sort of core of human existence and the society as a secondary environment around this core. Society was inside the human body. In contrast, the epistemological [[solipsism]] treated human existence as if the human being was alone in the world – and was only in a secondary process "socialized" ([[Peter Sloterdijk]] 1998 vol. 1).

Another current assumption is the historical-sociological individualism. Sociologists as [[Ulrich Beck]] and [[Anthony Giddens]] have postulated that individualization during "high" or "late modernity" had replaced all earlier traditions – religion, nation, class – and left "the individual" alone with its body. The body, thus, got a central position as the only fix-point of "[[self-identity]]" left after the dissolution of the traditional norms. The individual chooses and makes its own body as a sort of "[[gesamtkunstwerk]] [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|Ego]]".

Body-cultural studies have challenged this assumption ([[Henning Eichberg]] 2010: 58-79). They throw light on inter-bodily relations, within which the human individuality has a much more complex position.

== Social time ==

An important aspect of body culture is temporal. Modern society is characterized by the significance of speed and acceleration. Sport, giving priority to competitive running and racing, is central among the phenomena illustrating the specifically modern velocity (Eichberg 1978, Bale 2004). The historical change from the circulating stroll in aristocratic and early bourgeois culture to modern [[jogging]] as well as the changes from coach traffic via the railway (Schivelbusch 1977) to the sport race of automobiles (→[[auto racing]]) (Sachs 1984) produced new body-cultural configurations of social time.

On the basis of [[transportation]] and [[urbanism]], [[blitzkrieg]] and sports, the French architect and cultural theorist [[Paul Virilio]] (1977) launched the terms of "dromology" (i.e. science of racing) and "dromocracy" (power or dominance of velocity) to describe the knowledge and the politics of modern social acceleration. But the concept of social time embraces many more differentiations, which can be explored by comparing time-dynamic movements of different ethnic cultures (Hall 1984).

== Social space ==

Another important aspect of body culture is spatial. Bodily display and movement always create space – physical space as socio-psychical space and vice versa. Bodily activities have during history changed between indoor or outdoor milieus, between non-specialized environment, specialized facilities (→[[sports facilities]]) and bodily opposition against existing standardized facilities or what was called "sport scape". In movement, straight lines and the culture of the streamline were confronted by [[mazes]] and [[labyrinthine]] structures, by patterns of [[fractal]] geometry. All these patterns are not just spatial-practical arrangements, but they play together with societal orientations. Under this aspect, one has described the history of panoptical control (Foucault 1975; Vertinsky/ Bale 2004), the parcellation of the sportive space, and the hygienic purification of spaces (Augestad 2003). [[Proxemics]] (Hall 1966), the study of distance and space, has become a special field of body culture studies.

Body culture studies have also influenced the understanding of "nature". In the period around 1800, the "nature" of body culture – of outdoor life, [[naturism]] and green movements (→[[green politics]]) – became a world of liberation and opposition: "Back to nature!" In the course of modern industrial culture, this "other" nature became subjected to colonization and simulation, forming a "second nature". It even became a virtual world, which is simulating people's senses as a "third nature". The study of body culture contributed to a history of [[cultural ecology]] (Eichberg 1988).

Body cultural studies also contributed to a differentiation between what in everyday language often is confused as 'space' and 'place' whose dialectics were shown by the Chinese-American philosopher [[Yi-Fu Tuan]] (see Bale 2004). Space can be described by coordinates and by certain [[choreographies]]. Spatial structures can be standardized and transferred from place to place, which is the case with the standardized facilities of sports. Place, in contrast, is unique – it is only here or there. Locality is related to identity. People play in a certain place – and create the place by play and game. The place plays with the people, as a co-player.

== Body culture and politics ==
Body culture can also be considered political such as how the [[body shape]] and appearance as well as sports, dance, and other recreational activities manifest and influence social change driven by politics. This is best demonstrated by [[practice theory]], which explains that, since body techniques serve as the means by which existing social order is produced and maintained, it, therefore, become important sites for challenging and transforming the social order when change does occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Training the Body for China: Sports in the Moral Order of the People's Republic|last=Brownell|first=Susan|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1995|isbn=0226076466|location=Chicago|pages=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; In power plays, for instance, the body is used in sporting events as a form of rhetoric, articulating political causes. Immediately after the 9/11 attacks, the body became an important part of [[George W. Bush]]'s [[geopolitics]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cultural Politics of Post-9/11 American Sport: Power, Pedagogy and the Popular|last=Silk|first=Michael|publisher=Routledge|year=2012|isbn=9780415873413|location=New York|pages=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the projection of American power. On the other hand, the body was also used to condemn elitist and spectator sport within a mass physical culture starting this period in America, which evokes participation, inclusion, and populism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The body is an integral component in the [[Feminist political theory|feminist politics]]. It is maintained that in order for this feminist initiatives to be effective, it is imperative that women's bodies, along with their works, labor, and voice, are present for everyone to see.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Female Body in Western Culture: Contemporary Perspectives|last=Suleiman|first=Susan|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1986|isbn=0674298713|location=Cambridge|pages=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Civilisation, discipline, modernity ==

Studies of body culture enriched the analysis of historical change by conflicting terms. [[Norbert Elias]] (1986) studied sport in order to throw light on the ''civilizing process'' (→[[The Civilizing Process]]). In sports, he saw a line going from original violence to civilized interlacement and pacification. Though there were undertones of hope, Elias tried to avoid [[evolutionism]], which since the nineteenth century postulated a 'progressive' way from 'primitive' to 'civilized' patterns.

While the concept of civilization normally had hopeful undertones, ''[[discipline]]'' had more critical undertones. Cultures of bodily discipline became visible – following [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and the [[Frankfurt School]] – in [[Baroque dance]] (Lippe 1974), in aristocratic and bourgeois pedagogy of the spinal column during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Vigarello 1978), and in [[hygienic]] strategies, school sanitation and school gymnastics during the twentieth century (Augestad 2003). Military exercise (→[[military drill]]) in Early Modern times was the classic field for body cultural discipline (Gaulhofer 1930; Kleinschmidt 1989).

In the field of sports, a central point of body-cultural dispute has been the question whether sport had its roots in Ancient Greek competitions of the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] type or whether it was fundamentally linked to modernity. While nineteenth century's Neo-Humanism, Classicism and [[Olympism]] assumed the ancient roots of sport, body cultural studies showed that the patterns central to modern sports – quantification, rationalisation, principle of achievement – could not be dated before the industrial culture of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (Eichberg 1978; Guttmann 1978). What was practiced before, were popular games, noble exercises, festivities of different character, children's games and competitions, but not sport in modern understanding. The emergence of modern sport was an eruptive innovation rather than a logical prolongation of earlier practices. As a revolution of body culture, this transformation contributed to a deeper understanding of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The so-called Eichberg-Mandell-Guttmann theory about the uniqueness of modern sport became, however, a matter of controversies and was opposed by other historians (Carter/Krüger 1990).

What came out of the controversies between the concepts of modernity, evolution, civilization, discipline and revolution was that "[[modernization]]" only can be thought as a non-lineal change with nuances and full of contradictions. This is how the history of sport (Nielsen 1993 and 2005) and of gymnastics (Defrance 1987; Vestergård Madsen 2003) as well as the history of [[running]] (Bale 2004) have been described in body-cultural terms.

One of the visible and at the same time deeper changes in relation to the modern body concerns the dress reform and the appearance of the naked body, especially in the years between 1900 and the 1920s. The change from noble pale skin to suntanned skin as a 'sportive' distinction was not only linked to sport, but had a strong impact on society as a whole. The change of appreciated body colour reversed the social-bodily distinctions between people and classes fundamentally, and nudism became a radical expression of this body-cultural change.

== Industrial body and production ==

Body culture studies have cast new light on the origins and conditions of the Industrial Revolution, which in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries transformed people's everyday life in a fundamental way. The traditional common-sense explanations of [[industrialization]] by technology and economy as 'driving forces' have shown as insufficient. Economic interests and technological change had their basic conditions in human social-bodily practice. The history of sport and games in body cultural perspective showed that this practice was changing one or two generations, before the Industrial Revolution as a technological and economic transformation took place. What had been [[carnival]]-like festivities, [[tournaments]] and popular games before, became modern sport by a new focus on results, measuring and quantifying records (Eichberg 1978; Guttmann 1978). Under the aspect of the principle of achievement, there was no sport in ancient Egypt, in ancient Greece, among the [[Aztecs]] or [[Vikings]], and in European [[Middle Ages]], though there were games, competitions and festivities. Sport as a new type of body culture resulted from societal changes in the eighteenth-nineteenth centuries.

The genesis of sport in connection with industrial [[productivity]] called to attention the historical-cultural relativity of "production" (→[[Manufacturing]]) itself. Studies in the history of "the human motor" and the "mortal engines" of sport showed reification (→[[reification (Marxism)]]) and technology as lines of historical dynamics (Rigauer 1969; Vigarello 1988; Rabinbach 1992; Hoberman 1992). Production became apparent not as a universal concept, but as something historically specific – and sport was its body-cultural ritual.

== Trialectics of body culture ==

Body culture as a field of contradictions demands a dialectical approach, but it is not dualistic in character. Body culture studies have revealed trialectical relations inside the world of sports (Eichberg 1998, 2010; Bale 1996, 2002 and 2004).

The hegemonic model of Western modern body culture is ''achievement sport'', translating movement into records. Sportive competition follows the logic of productivity by bodily strain and forms a ranking pyramid with elite sports placed at the top and the losers at the bottom. Through sportive movement, people display a theatre of production.

A contrasting model within modern body culture is delivered by ''mass sports''. In [[gymnastics]] and [[fitness training]], the body is disciplined by subjecting it to certain rules of "scientific", social geometrical or aesthetic order (Roubal 2007). By rhythmic repetition and formal homogenization, the individual bodies are integrated into a larger whole, which is recommended in terms of reproduction (→[[reproduction (economics)]]), as being healthy and educative. Through fitness sport, people absolve a ritual of reproductive correctness and integration.

A third model is present in ''popular festivity'', ''dance and play''. In carnival and folk sport, people meet people by festive movement. This type of gathering may give life to the top-down arrangements of both productive achievement sport and reproductive fitness sport, too. But the body experience of popular festivity, dance, play and game is a-productive in itself – it celebrates relation in movement.

Practices of sport in their diversity and their historical change, thus, clarify inner contradictions inside social life more generally – among these the contradictions between state, market and civil society. The trialectics of body culture throw light on the complexity of societal relations.

== Body cultures in plural ==

"Culture" in singular is an abstraction. The study of body culture is always a study of body cultures in plural. Body cultures show human life in variety and differences, assimilation and distinction, conflicts and contradictions. This demands a comparative approach to otherness, and this is the way several studies in body culture have gone.

Culture was studied as cultures already by the school of [[Cultural Relativism]] in American anthropology ([[American Anthropological Association]]) in the 1930s ([[Ruth Benedict]]). [[Postcolonial]] studies have taken this [[Cultural pluralism|pluralistic]] perspective up again (Bale 1996 and 2004; Brownell 1995; Azoy 2003; Leseth 2004). The discourse in singular about "the body in our society" became problematic when confronted with body cultures in conflict and tension.

The plurality and diversity of body cultures is, however, not only a matter of outward relations. There are also body cultures in plural inside a given society. The study of different class habitus (→[[class culture]]), [[youth cultures]], gender cultures (→[[gender identity]]) etc. opened up for deeper insights into the differentiation of civil society.

== Configurational analysis ==

Body culture studies try to understand bodily practice as patterns revealing the inner tensions and contradictions of a given society. In order to analyze these connections, the study of body culture has turned attention to the configurations of movement in time and space, the energy of movement, its interpersonal relations and objectification (→[[Configurational analysis (Konfigurationsanalyse)]]). Above this basis, people build a superstructure of institutions and ideas, organising and reflecting body culture in relation to collective actions and interests (Eichberg 1978; Dietrich 2001: 10-32; see keyword 2).

By elaborating the complex interplay between bodily practice and the superstructures of ideas and conscience, body cultures studies challenge the established history and sociology.

The '''Campaign for Social Science''' was launched in 2011 to advocate social science to the UK Government and to the public, at a time of significant change in the higher education system. It campaigns for the restoration of the post of Government Chief Social Science Advisor, promotes social science in the media and on the web, and organises roadshows and other events to emphasise the value of social science.

==History==
The Campaign was established by the [[Academy of Social Sciences]] and was formally launched at the House of Lords in January 2011, at an event that featured speakers including [[Trevor Phillips]], Chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, [[Polly Toynbee]], the Guardian columnist, and [[David Willetts]], the then Universities and Science Minister in the Coalition Government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialsciencespace.com/2011/01/launch-of-campaign-for-social-science-in-the-uk Launch of Campaign for Social Science in the UK&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Campaign receives no state funding, and relies on donations and sponsorship; among its sponsors are 50 universities, 23 learned societies, six publishers and two charities. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uk.sagepub.com/aboutus/press/2012/apr/11_apr.htm | SAGE]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lobbying==
The Campaign has urged the restoration of the post of Government Chief Social Science Advisor, which was removed in 2010 when the role was downgraded and split between two people who also have other responsibilities. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/mar/19/the-case-for-a-chief-social-scientist The case for a chief social scientist | Higher Education Network | Guardian Professional&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Campaign made its case to the House of Lords Science Select Committee on Science and Technology, which issued a report in February 2012 calling for the post to be reinstated.  

==Events== 
As of December 2013, the Campaign had held 19 roadshows at universities around the UK to emphasise the value and importance of social science and to encourage support and donations. 

With the Academy of Social Sciences, the Campaign organised a conference on the [[2011 England riots]] at [[Gresham College]], London, in October 2011, and a public discussion on the future of universities, at the University of East London in October 2011. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/joepublic/2011/oct/12/what-caused-england-riots?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487| The Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; The Campaign held a launch for the latest booklet in its Making the Case for the Social Sciences, in November 2013, on mental wellbeing; speakers including Professor Lord Richard Layard and Andy Burnham, Shadow Secretary of State for Health. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgHwKFSVnTs&amp;feature=youtu.be| YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Capillary electrochromatography''' ('''CEC''') is a [[Chromatography|chromatographic]] technique in which the mobile phase is driven through the chromatographic bed by [[electroosmosis]].&lt;ref name="DittmannRozing1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dittmann|first1=Monika M.|last2=Rozing|first2=Gerard P.|title=Capillary electrochromatography — a high-efficiency micro-separation technique|journal=Journal of Chromatography A|volume=744|issue=1–2|year=1996|pages=63–74|issn=00219673|doi=10.1016/0021-9673(96)00382-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CikaloBartle1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cikalo|first1=Maria G.|last2=Bartle|first2=Keith D.|last3=Robson|first3=Mark M.|last4=Myers|first4=Peter|last5=Euerby|first5=Melvin R.|title=Capillary electrochromatography|journal=The Analyst|volume=123|issue=7|year=1998|pages=87–102|issn=00032654|doi=10.1039/a801148f|bibcode=1998Ana...123...87C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capillary electrochromatography is a combination of two analytical techniques, [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] and [[capillary electrophoresis]]. Capillary electrophoresis aims to separate analytes on the basis of their [[mass-to-charge ratio]] by passing a high voltage across ends of a [[capillary tube]], which is filled with the analyte. High-performance liquid chromatography separates analytes by passing them, under high pressure, through a column filled with [[stationary phase (chemistry)|stationary phase]]. The interactions between the analytes and the stationary phase and [[mobile phase]] lead to the separation of the analytes. In capillary electrochromatography capillaries, packed with HPLC stationary phase, are subjected to a high voltage. Separation is achieved by electrophoretic migration of solutes and differential partitioning.

==Principle==
Capillary electrochromatography (CEC) combines the principles used in HPLC and CE. The mobile phase is driven across the chromatographic bed using electroosmosis instead of pressure (as in HPLC). Electroosmosis is the motion of liquid induced by an applied potential across a porous material, capillary tube, membrane or any other fluid conduit. Electroosmotic flow is caused by the [[Coulomb force]] induced by an electric field on net mobile electric charge in a solution. Under [[alkaline]] conditions, the surface [[silanol]] groups of the fused silica will become ionised leading to a negatively charged surface. This surface will have a layer of positively charged ions in close proximity which are relatively immobilised. This layer of ions is called the [[Stern layer]]. The thickness of the double layer is given by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta=\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_r\epsilon_0RT}{2cF^2 }} &lt;/math&gt;

where ε&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[relative permittivity]] of the medium, ε&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the permittivity of vacuum, R is the [[universal gas constant]], T is the [[absolute temperature]], c is the [[molar concentration]], and F is the [[Faraday constant]]

When an electric field is applied to the fluid (usually via electrodes placed at inlets and outlets), the net charge in the electrical double layer is induced to move by the resulting Coulomb force. The resulting flow is termed electroosmotic flow. In CEC positive ions of the electrolyte added along with the analyte accumulate in the electrical double layer of the particles of the column packing on application of an electric field they move towards the cathode and drag the liquid mobile phase with them.

The relationship between the linear velocity u of the liquid in the capillary and the applied electric field is given by the [[Smoluchowski equation]] as 

:&lt;math&gt; u = \epsilon_r\epsilon_0 \zeta E \eta&lt;/math&gt; 

where ζ is the potential across the Stern layer ([[zeta potential]]), E is the [[electric field strength]], and η is the [[viscosity]] of the solvent.

Separation of components in CEC is based on interactions between the stationary phase and differential electrophoretic migration of solutes.

==Instrumentation==
The components of a capillary electrochromatograph are a sample [[vial]], source and destination vials, a packed capillary, electrodes, a [[high voltage power supply]], a detector, and a data output and handling device. The source vial, destination vial and capillary are filled with an electrolyte such as an aqueous buffer solution. The capillary is packed with stationary phase. To introduce the sample, the capillary inlet is placed into a vial containing the sample and then returned to the source vial (sample is introduced into the capillary via capillary action, pressure, or siphoning). The migration of the analytes is then initiated by an electric field that is applied between the source and destination vials and is supplied to the electrodes by the high-voltage power supply. The analytes separate as they migrate due to their electrophoretic mobility, and are detected near the outlet end of the capillary. The output of the detector is sent to a data output and handling device such as an [[integrator]] or computer. The data is then displayed as an [[electropherogram]], which reports detector response as a function of time. Separated chemical compounds appear as peaks with different migration times in an [[electropherogram]].

==Advantages==
Avoiding the use of pressure to introduce the mobile phase into the column, results in a number of important advantages. Firstly, the pressure driven flow rate across a column depends directly on the square of the particle diameter and inversely on the length of the column. This restricts the length of the column and size of the particle, particle size is seldom less than 3 micrometer and the length of the column is restricted to 25&amp;nbsp;cm. Electrically driven flow rate is independent of length of column and size. A second advantage of using electroosmosis to pass the mobile phase into the column is the plug-like flow velocity profile of EOF, which reduces the solute dispersion in the column, increasing column efficiency.

{{Linguistics}}
'''Constraint-based grammars''' can perhaps be best understood in contrast to [[generative grammar]]s. A generative grammar lists all the transformations, merges, movements, and deletions that can result in all [[well-formedness|well-formed]] sentences, while constraint-based grammars, take the opposite approach, allowing anything that is not otherwise constrained. "The grammar is nothing but a set of constraints that structures are required to satisfy in order to be considered well-formed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollard|first1=Carl|title=The nature of constraint-based grammar|url=http://isli.khu.ac.kr/journal/content/data/15/1.pdf|website=11th Pacific Asian conference on language, information and computation}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A constraint-based grammar is more like a data base or a knowledge representation system than it is like a collection of algorithms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pollard|first1=Carl|title=The nature of constraint-based grammar|url=http://isli.khu.ac.kr/journal/content/data/15/1.pdf|website=11th Pacific Asian conference on language, information and computation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Dormancy}}
'''Diapause''', when referencing animal dormancy, is the delay in development in response to regularly and recurring periods of adverse environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;The Insects; Structure and Function, 4th Edition. R.F. Chapman, Cambridge University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-521-57048-4}}, p 403.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tauber"&gt;Tauber, M.J., Tauber, C.A., Masaki, S. (1986) ''Seasonal Adaptations of Insects''. Oxford University Press, 414 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be a [[physiological]] state of [[dormancy]] with very specific initiating and inhibiting conditions. Diapause is a mechanism used as a means to survive predictable, unfavorable environmental conditions, such as temperature extremes, drought, or reduced food availability. Diapause is most often observed in [[arthropod]]s, especially [[insect]]s, and in the [[embryo]]s of many of the [[oviparity|oviparous]] [[species]] of fish in the order [[Cyprinodontiformes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9254916 |title=A molecular phylogeny for aplocheiloid fishes (Atherinomorpha, Cyprinodontiformes): the role of vicariance and the origins of annualism |author=Glen E. Collier |author2=William J. Murphy |date= August 1997 |quote=Annual aplocheiloid killifish embryos possess a rare ability among vertebrates to enter stages of developmental arrest (diapause) when subjected to adverse environmental conditions. |volume=14 |issue=8 |journal=Mol. Biol. Evol. |pages=790–9 |doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a025819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activity levels of diapausing stages can vary considerably among species. Diapause may occur in a completely immobile stage, such as the [[pupae]] and eggs, or it may occur in very active stages that undergo extensive migrations, such as the adult [[monarch butterfly]], ''Danaus plexippus''. In cases where the insect remains active, feeding is reduced and reproductive development is slowed or halted.

==Phases of insect diapause==
Diapause in insects is a dynamic process consisting of several distinct phases. While diapause varies considerably from one [[taxon]] of insects to another, these phases can be characterized by particular sets of metabolic processes and responsiveness of the insect to certain environmental stimuli.&lt;ref name="Kostal"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kostal |first1= V |year= 2006 |title= Eco-physiological phases of insect diapause |url= |journal= Journal of Insect Physiology |volume= 52 |issue= |pages= 113–127 |doi=10.1016/j.jinsphys.2005.09.008 |pmid=16332347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diapause can occur during any stage of development in arthropods, but each species exhibits diapause in specific phases of development. Reduced oxygen consumption is typical as is reduced movement and feeding.&lt;ref&gt;The Insects; Structure and Function, 4th Edition. R.F. Chapman, Cambridge University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-521-57048-4}}, pp. 403–404&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Polistes exclamans]]'' only the queen is said to be able to undergo diapause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bohm |first1= |year= 1972 |title= Effects of environment and juvenile hormone on ovaries of the wasp, Polistes metricus |url= |journal= Insect Physiology |volume= 18 |issue= 1 |pages= 1875–1883 |doi= 10.1016/0022-1910(72)90158-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of diapause periods===
The sensitive stage is the period when stimulus must occur to trigger diapause in the organism.

|}

===Induction===
The induction phase occurs at a genetically predetermined stage of life, and occurs well in advance of the environmental stress.&lt;ref name="Kostal" /&gt; This sensitive stage may occur within the lifetime of the diapausing individual, or in preceding generations, particularly in egg diapause.&lt;ref name="Huffaker"&gt;Huffaker, C.B. and Gutierrez, A.P., Eds. 1999. Ecological Entomology. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; During this phase, insects are responsive to external cues called token stimuli, which trigger the switch from direct development pathways to diapause pathways. Token stimuli can consist of changes in [[photoperiod]], [[thermoperiod]], or [[allelochemicals]] from food plants. These stimuli are not in themselves favourable or unfavourable to development, but they herald an impending change in environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="Tauber" /&gt;

===Preparation===
The preparation phase usually follows the induction phase, though insects may go directly from induction to initiation without a preparation phase.&lt;ref name="Kostal" /&gt; During this phase, insects accumulate and store molecules such as [[lipids]], [[proteins]], and [[carbohydrates]]. These molecules are used to maintain the insect throughout diapause and to provide fuel for development following diapause termination. Composition of the [[cuticle]] may be altered by changing [[hydrocarbon]] composition and by adding [[lipids]] to reduce water loss, making the organism resistant to desiccation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= HEGDEKAR |first1= B. M. |year= 1979 |title= Epicuticular Wax Secretion in Diapause and Non-diapause Pupae of the Bertha Army worm |url= |journal= Annals of the Entomological Society of America |volume= 72 |issue= 1 |pages= 13–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Diapausing [[pupa]]ria of the [[flesh fly]], ''Sarcophaga crassipalpis'', increase the amount of cuticular [[hydrocarbons]] lining the puparium, effectively reducing the ability of water to cross the cuticle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Yoder |first1= J.A. |last2= Denlinger |first2= D.L. |last3= Dennis |first3= M.W. |last4= Kolattukudey |first4= P.E. |year= 1992 |title= Enhancement of diapausing flesh fly puparia with additional hydrocarbons and evidence for alkane biosynthesis by a decarbonylation mechanism |url= |journal= Insect Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |volume= 22 |issue= 3 |pages= 237–243 |doi=10.1016/0965-1748(92)90060-r}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initiation===
[[Photoperiod]] is the most important stimulus initiating diapause.&lt;ref name=Chapman404/&gt; The initiation phase begins when morphological development ceases.&lt;ref name="Kostal" /&gt; In some cases, this change may be very distinct and can involve [[ecdysis|moulting]] into a specific diapause stage, or be accompanied by color change. [[Enzyme|Enzymatic]] changes may take place in preparation for [[cold hardening]]. For example, only diapausing adults of the fire bug, ''Pyrrhocoris apterus'', have the enzymatic complement that allows them to accumulate [[polyol|polyhydric alcohols]], molecules that help to lower their freezing points and thus avoid freezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kostal |first1= V. |last2= Tollarova |first2= M. |last3= Sula |first3= J. |year= 2004 |title= Adjustments of the enzymatic complement for polyol biosynthesis and accumulation in diapausing cold-acclimated adults of [[Pyrrhocoris apterus]] |url= |journal= Journal of Insect Physiology |volume= 50 |issue= |pages= 303–313 |doi=10.1016/j.jinsphys.2004.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Insects may also undergo behavioural changes and begin to aggregate, [[insect migration|migrate]], or search for suitable [[overwinter]]ing sites.[[File:Angangueo monarchs.jpg|thumb|Overwintering [[monarch butterflies]] in diapause clustering on [[oyamel]] trees. One tree is completely covered in butterflies. These butterflies were located on a preserve outside of [[Angangueo]], [[Michoacán]], [[Mexico]]]]

During the maintenance phase, insects experience lowered [[metabolism]] and developmental arrest is maintained.&lt;ref name="Kostal" /&gt; Sensitivity to certain stimuli which act to prevent termination of diapause, such as [[photoperiod]] and [[temperature]], is increased. At this stage, insects are unresponsive to changes in the [[natural environment|environment]] that will eventually trigger the end of diapause, but they grow more sensitive to these stimuli as time progresses.

===Termination===
In insects that undergo obligate diapause, termination may occur spontaneously, without any external stimuli.&lt;ref name="Kostal" /&gt; In facultative diapausers, token [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] must occur to terminate diapause. These [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] may include chilling, freezing, or contact with [[water]], depending on the environmental conditions being avoided. These stimuli are important in preventing the insect from terminating diapause too soon, for instance in response to warm [[weather]] in late [[fall]]. In the [[Edith's checkerspot]] butterfly, individuals must receive enough sunlight in order to terminate the diapause stage and become a fully grown butterfly.&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weiss |first1=Stuart B. |last2=White |first2=Raymond R. |last3=Murphy |first3=Dennis D. |last4=Ehrlich |first4=Paul R. |title=Growth and Dispersal of Larvae of Checkerspot Butterfly Euphydryas editha |journal=Oikos |date=October 1987 |volume=50 |issue=2 |pages=161–166 |doi=10.2307/3565996 |jstor=3565996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Termination may occur at the height of unfavourable conditions, such as in the middle of winter. Over time, depth of diapause slowly decreases until direct development can resume, if conditions are favourable.

===Post-diapause quiescence===
Diapause frequently ends prior to the end of unfavourable conditions and is followed by a state of [[wikt:quiescence|quiescence]] from which the insect can arouse and begin direct development, should conditions change to become more favourable.&lt;ref name="Kostal" /&gt; This allows the insect to continue to withstand harsh conditions while being ready to take advantage of good conditions as rapidly as possible.

==Regulation==
Diapause in insects is regulated at several levels. Environmental stimuli interact with genetic pre-programming to affect [[neuron]]al signalling, [[endocrine]] pathways, and, eventually, metabolic and enzymatic changes.

===Environmental===
Environmental regulators of diapause generally display a characteristic [[season|seasonal pattern]]. In [[temperate]] regions, photoperiod is the most reliable cues of seasonal change.&lt;ref name="Huffaker" /&gt; Depending on the season in which diapause occurs, either short or long days can act as token stimuli. Insects may also respond to changing day length as well as relative day length. Temperature may also act as a regulating factor, either by inducing diapause or, more commonly, by modifying the response of the insect to photoperiod.&lt;ref name="Huffaker" /&gt; Insects may respond to thermoperiod, the daily fluctuations of warm and cold that correspond with night and day, as well as to absolute or cumulative temperature. This is has been observed in many moth species including the [[indian mealmoth]], where individuals diapause in different developmental stages due to environmental temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tzanakakis|first=M. E.|date=1959-11-01|title=An ecological study of the Indian-meal mothPlodia interpunctella(Hübner) with emphasis on diapause|url=http://hilgardia.ucanr.edu/Abstract/?a=hilg.v29n05p205|journal=Hilgardia|language=English|volume=29|issue=5|pages=205–246|doi=10.3733/hilg.v29n05p205|issn=0073-2230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food availability and quality may also help regulate diapause. In the [[desert locust]], ''Schistocerca gregaria'', a plant [[hormone]] called [[gibberellin]] stimulates [[reproduction|reproductive]] development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ellis |first1= P.E. |last2= Carlisle |first2= D.B. |last3= Osborne |first3= D.J. |year= 1965 |title= Desert locusts: sexual maturation delayed by feeding on senescent vegetation |url= |journal= Science |volume= 149 |issue= 3683 |pages= 546–547 |doi=10.1126/science.149.3683.546 |pmid=17843190}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the dry season, when their food plants are in [[senescence]] and lacking gibberellin, the locusts remain immature and their reproductive tracts do not develop.

===Neuroendocrine===
The [[neuroendocrinology|neuroendocrine]] system of insects consists primarily of neurosecretory cells in the [[brain]], the corpora cardiaca, corpora allata and the prothoracic glands.&lt;ref name="Tauber" /&gt; There are several key [[hormone]]s involved in the regulation of diapause: [[juvenile hormone]] (JH), diapause hormone (DH), and [[prothoracicotropic hormone|prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH)]].&lt;ref name="Denlinger"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Denlinger |first1= D.L. |year= 2002 |title= Regulation of diapause |url= |journal= Annual Review of Entomology |volume= 47 |issue= |pages= 93–122 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.ento.47.091201.145137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prothoracicotropic hormone stimulates the prothoracic glands to produce [[ecdysteroids]] that are required to promote development.&lt;ref name="Denlinger" /&gt; Larval and pupal diapauses are often regulated by an interruption of this connection, either by preventing release of prothoracicotropic hormone from the brain or by failure of the prothoracic glands to respond to prothoracicotropic hormone.

The corpora allata is responsible for the production of [[juvenile hormone]] (JH). In the bean bug, ''Riptortus pedestris'', clusters of [[neurons]] on the [[protocerebrum]] called the [[pars lateralis]] maintain reproductive diapause by inhibiting JH production by the [[corpora allata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Shimokawa |first1= K. |last2= Numata |first2= H. |last3= Shiga |first3= S. |year= 2008 |title= [[Neurons]] important for the [[photoperiod]]ic control of diapause in the bean bug, ''Riptortus pedestris'' |url= |journal= Journal of Comparative Physiology |volume= 194 |issue= |pages= 751–762 |doi=10.1007/s00359-008-0346-y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adult diapause is often associated with the absence of JH, while larval diapause is often associated with its presence.

In adults, absence of JH causes degeneration of flight [[muscles]] and [[atrophy]] or cessation of development of reproductive tissues, and halts mating behaviour. The presence of JH in larvae may prevent moulting to the next larval [[instar]], though successive stationary moults may still occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Yin |first1= C.M. |last2= Chippendale |first2= G.M. |year= 1979 |title= Diapause of the Southwestern Corn Borer, ''Diatraea grandiosella'': further evidence showing juvenile hormone to be the regulator |url= |journal= Journal of Insect Physiology |volume= 25 |issue= |pages= 513–523 |doi=10.1016/s0022-1910(79)80010-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the corn borer, ''Diatraea gradiosella'', JH is required for the accumulation by the fat body of a storage [[protein]] that is associated with diapause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Brown |first1= J.J. |last2= Chippendale |first2= G.M. |year= 1978 |title= Juvenile hormone and a protein associated with the larval diapause of the Southwestern Corn Borer, ''Diatraea grandiosella'' |url= |journal= Insect Biochemistry |volume= 8 |issue= |pages= 359–397 |doi=10.1016/0020-1790(78)90022-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diapause hormone regulates [[embryo]]nic diapause in the eggs of the [[silkworm]] moth, ''Bombyx mori''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Horie |first1= Y. |last2= Kanda |first2= T. |last3= Mochida |first3= Y. |year= 2000 |title= Sorbitol as an arrester of embryonic development in diapausing eggs of the silkworm, ''Bombyx mori'' |url= |journal= Journal of Insect Physiology |volume= 46 |issue= |pages= 1009–1016 |doi=10.1016/s0022-1910(99)00212-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; DH is released from the [[subesophageal ganglion]] of the mother and triggers [[trehalase]] production by the [[ovaries]]. This generates high levels of [[glycogen]] in the [[egg (biology)|eggs]], which is converted into the polyhydric alcohols [[glycerol]] and [[sorbitol]]. [[Sorbitol]] directly inhibits the development of the embryos. [[Glycerol]] and [[sorbitol]] are reconverted into [[glycogen]] at the termination of diapause.

==Tropical diapause==
Diapause in the [[tropics]] is often initiated in response to [[biotic component|biotic]] rather than [[abiotic component]]s.&lt;ref name="DenlingerD"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Denlinger |first1= D.L. |year= 1986 |title= Dormancy in tropical insects |url= |journal= Annual Review of Entomology |volume= 31 |issue= |pages= 239–264 |doi=10.1146/annurev.en.31.010186.001323 |pmid=3510585}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, food in the form of [[vertebrate]] carcasses may be more abundant following dry seasons, or [[oviposition]] sites in the form of fallen [[trees]] may be more available following rainy seasons. Also, diapause may serve to synchronize mating seasons or reduce competition, rather than to avoid unfavourable climatic conditions.

Diapause in the tropics poses several challenges to insects that are not faced in [[temperate]] zones.&lt;ref name="DenlingerD" /&gt; Insects must reduce their metabolism without the aid of cold temperatures and may be faced with increased water loss due to high temperatures. While cold temperatures inhibit the growth of [[fungi]] and [[bacteria]], diapausing tropical insects still have to deal with these [[pathogens]]. Also, [[predation|predator]]s and [[parasitism|parasites]] may still be abundant during the diapause period.

Aggregations are common among diapausing tropical insects, especially in the orders [[Coleoptera]], [[Lepidoptera]], and [[Hemiptera]].&lt;ref name="DenlingerD" /&gt; Aggregations may be used as protection against [[predation]], since aggregating species are frequently toxic and predators quickly learn to avoid them. They can also serve to reduce water loss, as seen in the fungus [[beetle]], ''Stenotarsus rotundus'', which forms aggregations of up to 70,000 individuals, which may be eight beetles deep. [[Relative humidity]] is increased within the aggregations and beetles experience less water loss, probably due to decreased surface area to volume ratios reducing evaporative water loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Yoder |first1= J.A. |last2= Denlinger |first2= D.L. |last3= Wolda |first3= H. |year= 1992 |title= Aggregation promotes water conservation during diapause in the tropical fungus beetle, ''Stenotarsus rotundus'' |url= |journal= Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata |volume= 63 |issue= |pages= 203–205 |doi=10.1111/j.1570-7458.1992.tb01574.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6137">'''Doubling''' is a [[textile]] industry term synonymous with combining. It can be used for various processes during [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]]. During the carding stage, several sources of [[roving]]  are doubled together and drawn, to remove variations in thickness. After spinning, yarn is doubled for many reasons. Yarn may be doubled to produce warp for weaving, to make cotton for lace, crochet and knitting. {{sfn|Naismith|1896|p=557}} It is used for embroidery threads and [[sewing thread]]s, for example: sewing thread is usually 6-cable thread. Two threads of spun [[cotton count|60s cotton]] are twisted together, and three of these double threads are twisted into a cable, of what is now 5s yarn. This is [[mercerised cotton|mercerised]], [[Gassing (textile process)|gassed]] (AKA flamed) and [[wound]] onto a bobbin. {{sfn|Naismith|1896|p=567}}

==Processing of cotton==
{{Cotton processing flowchart}}
===Doubling in the carding process===

In a wider sense carding can refer to the four processes of [[willowing]], lapping, [[carding]] and drawing.  During willowing the fibres are loosened; in lapping the dust is removed to create a flat sheet or lap of fibres. Carding combs the tangled lap into a thick rope or sliver of 1/2 inch in diameter, and removes the shorter fibres creating a stronger yarn.

During the carding process the staples are separated and then assembled into a loose strand (sliver or tow).
The carders line up the staples to prepare them for spinning. The carding machine consists mainly of one big roller with smaller ones surrounding it. All of the rollers are covered in small teeth, and as the cotton progresses further on the teeth get finer (i.e. closer together). The cotton leaves the carding machine in the form of a sliver; a large rope of fibres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|pp=66,67}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

In drawing,  4 slivers are combined into one. Repeated drawing decreases the quality of the sliver drastically, disabling finer counts from being spun.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each sliver will have thin and thick spots. By combining, or doubling several slivers together a more consistent size can be reached. The slivers are separated into rovings. These rovings (or slubbings) are then what are used in the spinning process. &lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Collier |1970|pp=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For machine processing, a roving is about the width of a pencil. The rovings are collected in a drum and proceed to the '''slubbing frame''' which adds twist, and winds onto bobbins. '''Intermediate Frames''' are used to repeat the slubbing process to produce a finer yarn, and then the '''roving frames''' reduces it to a finer thread, gives more twist, makes more regular and even in thickness, and winds onto a smaller tube.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hills|1993|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Masson Mills WTM 20 Derby Doubler 1902 Platts 5907.JPG|thumb|left|Derby Doubler:Masson Mills]]
Over time the processes were refined. At [[Masson Mill]] and at [[Helmshore Mills Textile Museum|Helmshore]], there are Derby Doublers. The Masson machine, built by Platts of Oldham in 1902, doubled rovings from the breaker cards into card lap. This was then passed through the finisher card to produce the rovings &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massonmills.co.uk/Museum/M/form.html.php?linknam=Derby_Doubler Masson Mill Derby Doubler]&lt;/ref&gt; This process was known as double carding. The Derby Doubler was patented by [[Evan Leigh]] of Ashton-under-Lyne (21 December 1810 - 2 February 1876) and, though superseded, still continued in service in condensing coarse counts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oneguyfrombarlick.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=359&amp;t=7270 One guy from Barlick: Evan Leigh and the Derby Doubler] Stanley Graham&lt;/ref&gt;

===The doubling process===
Doubling of yarn where two or more stands or ends of yarn are twisted together. There are many purposes where doubled yarn is used. Sometimes thread is doubled to make warp, and it is invariably used for the manufacture of knitting yarn, crochet yarn and sewing yarn. All these yarns must be smooth and free from knots. In a sewing thread, the treads are doubled in two phases. Two or three strands are twisted together then three of these threads are twisted together, to form a six or nine cord.{{sfn|Naismith|1896|pp=58}}
The spun yarn is wound onto a bobbin using a ''doubling winding machine'', and two or more of these bobbins are placed on doubling frame (doubling winding machine). The ends pass through a series of rollers and twisted together onto one bobbin using a spindle and flyer. The process here is similar to that found in one of Arkwrights [[Water frame]]s, though the size of the ring, spindle and traveller are predictably larger. Alternatively a 'twiner' is used: this is a modified spinning mule and is mainly consigned to the doubling of warp thread {{sfn|Naismith|1896|p=564}}
High quality doubling depended on keeping the tension correct and feeding the produced thread evenly and tightly on a bobbin or flangeless paper tubes

'''Economic history''' is the study of [[Economy|economies]] or economic phenomena of the past. Analysis in economic history is undertaken using a combination of [[historical method]]s, [[statistical methods]] and the [[Applied economics|application of economic theory]] to historical situations and [[institution]]s. The topic includes [[Template:History of finance|financial]] and [[business history]] and overlaps with areas of [[social history]] such as [[Historical demography|demographic]] and [[Labor history (discipline)|labor history]]. The [[Quantitative research|quantitative]]—in this case, [[econometric]]—study of economic history is also known as [[cliometrics]].&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, "Cliometrics" by Robert Whaples in S. Durlauf and L. Blume (eds.), ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd ed. (2008). [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_C000173&amp;edition=current&amp;q=Economic%20history&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=7 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development as a separate field==
In Germany in the late 19th century, scholars in a number of universities, led by [[Gustav von Schmoller]], developed the [[Historical school of economics|historical school of economic history]]. It ignored quantitative and mathematical approaches. Historical approach dominated German and French scholarship for most of the 20th century. The approach was spread to Great Britain by [[William Ashley (economic historian)|William Ashley]], 1860–1927, and dominated British economic history for much of the 20th century. Britain's first professor in the subject was George Unwin at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]].&lt;ref name=MaxBODNB&gt;[[Maxine Berg|Berg, Maxine L.]] (2004) ‘Knowles , Lilian Charlotte Anne (1870–1926)’, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/45651, accessed 6 Feb 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MBerg&gt;Berg, M. (1992). The first women economic historians. ''The Economic History Review'', 45(2), 308–329.&lt;/ref&gt; In France, economic history was heavily influenced by the [[Annales School]] from the early 20th century to the present. It exerts a worldwide influence through its Journal ''[[Annales. Histoire, Sciences Sociales]].''&lt;ref&gt;Robert Forster, "Achievements of the Annales school." ''Journal of Economic History'' 38.01 (1978): 58–76. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2119315 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Treating economic history as a discrete academic discipline has been a contentious issue for many years.  Academics at the [[London School of Economics]] and the [[University of Cambridge]] had numerous [[London School of Economics#LSE vs. Cambridge|disputes]] over the separation of economics and economic history in the [[interwar era]]. Cambridge economists believed that pure economics involved a component of economic history and that the two were inseparably entangled. Those at the LSE believed that economic history warranted its own courses, research agenda and academic chair separated from mainstream economics.

In the initial period of the subject's development, the LSE position of separating economic history from economics won out. Many universities in the UK developed independent programmes in economic history rooted in the LSE model. Indeed, the [[Economic History Society]] had its inauguration at [[London School of Economics|LSE]] in 1926 and the [[University of Cambridge]] eventually established its own economic history programme. However, the past twenty years have witnessed the widespread closure of these separate programmes in the UK and the integration of the discipline into either history or economics departments. Only the LSE and the [[University of Edinburgh]] retain a separate economic history department and stand-alone undergraduate and graduate programme in economic history. Cambridge, Glasgow, the LSE and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] together train the vast majority of economic historians coming through the British [[Universities in the United Kingdom|higher education system]] today.

===United States===

Meanwhile, in the US, the field of economic history has in recent decades been largely subsumed into other fields of economics and is seen as a form of [[applied economics]]. As a consequence, there are no specialist economic history graduate programs at any universities anywhere in the country. Economic history remains as a special field component of regular economics or history PhD programs in universities including at [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[Harvard University]], [[Northwestern University]] and [[Yale University]].

==Economic history and economics==

[[Yale University]] economist [[Irving Fisher]] wrote in 1933 on the relationship between economics and economic history in his "Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions" (''Econometrica'', Vol. 1, No. 4: 337–38):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The study of dis-equilibrium may proceed in either of two ways. We may take as our unit for study an actual historical case of great dis-equilibrium, such as, say, the panic of 1873; or we may take as our unit for study any constituent tendency, such as, say, deflation, and discover its general laws, relations to, and combinations with, other tendencies. The former study revolves around events, or facts; the latter, around tendencies. The former is primarily economic history; the latter is primarily economic science. Both sorts of studies are proper and important. Each helps the other. The panic of 1873 can only be understood in light of the various tendencies involved—deflation and other; and deflation can only be understood in the light of various historical manifestations—1873 and other.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is a school of thought among economic historians that splits economic history—the study of how economic phenomena evolved in the past—from historical economics—testing the generality of economic theory using historical episodes. US economic historian [[Charles P. Kindleberger]] explained this position in his 1990 book ''Historical Economics: Art or Science?''.&lt;ref&gt;Charles P. Kindleberger (1990), [http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft287004zv;brand=ucpress ''Historical Economics: Art or Science?''], University of California Press, Berkeley&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[new economic history]], also known as [[cliometrics]], refers to the systematic use of economic theory and/or [[econometrics|econometric]] techniques to the study of economic history. The term cliometrics was originally coined by Jonathan R. T. Hughes and Stanley Reiter in 1960 and refers to [[Clio]], who was the [[muse]] of history and heroic poetry in [[Greek mythology]]. Cliometricians argue their approach is necessary because the application of theory is crucial in writing solid economic history, while historians generally oppose this view warning against the risk of generating anachronisms. Early cliometrics was a type of [[counterfactual history]]. However, counterfactualism is no longer its distinctive feature. Some have argued that cliometrics had its heyday in the 1960s and 1970s and that it is now neglected by economists and historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whaples |first=Robert |title=Is Economic History a Neglected Field of Study? |journal=Historically Speaking |year=2010 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=17–20 &amp; 20–27 (responses) |doi=10.1353/hsp.0.0109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades economic historians, following [[Douglass North]], have tended to move away from narrowly quantitative studies toward institutional, [[Social history|social]], and [[cultural history]] affecting the evolution of economies.&lt;ref&gt;Douglass C.

==Economic history and the history of capitalism==
{{main|History of capitalism}}
A new field calling itself the "History of Capitalism" has emerged in US history departments since about the year 2000. It includes many topics traditionally associated with the field of economic history, such as insurance, banking and regulation, the political dimension of business, and the impact of capitalism on the middle classes, the poor and women and minorities. The field utilizes the existing research of [[business history]], but has sought to make it more relevant to the concerns of history departments in the United States, including by having limited or no discussion of individual business enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;See Jennifer Schuessler "In History Departments, It’s Up With Capitalism" [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/education/in-history-departments-its-up-with-capitalism.html?_r=0 ''New York Times'' April 6, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lou Galambos, "Is This a Decisive Moment for the History of Business, Economic History, and the History Of Capitalism?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5149">The '''extended mind thesis''' ('''EMT''') says that an agent's mind and associated cognitive processing are neither skull-bound nor even body-bound, but extend into the agent's world.&lt;ref name=WilsonR&gt;
{{cite web |author1=Wilson, Robert A.  |author2=Foglia, Lucia |title=Embodied Cognition |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2011 Edition) |editor=Edward N. Zalta |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2011/entries/embodied-cognition/ |date=July 25, 2011}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Andy Clark|Clark]] and [[David Chalmers|Chalmers]] put it:

{{quote|Where does the mind stop and the rest of the world begin?...We propose to pursue... an ''active externalism'', based on the active role of the environment in driving cognitive processes.|Andy Clark and David Chalmers: "[[The Extended Mind]]"&lt;ref name=ChalmersD&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Andy Clark |author2=David J Chalmers |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3328150?sid=21105405194441&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=3739824&amp;uid=4 |title=The Extended Mind |journal=Analysis |volume=58 |issue=1 |date=January 1998 |pages=7–19 |doi=10.1093/analys/58.1.7}}; reprinted as: 
{{cite book |title= The Extended Mind |chapter=Chapter 2: The extended mind |author1=Andy Clark |author2=David J Chalmers |editor=Richard Menary  |pages=27–42 |isbn= 9780262014038 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2010}}; and available on line as: {{cite web |title=The extended mind |author1=Andy Clark |author2=David J Chalmers |url=http://cogprints.org/320/1/extended.html |publisher=Cogprints}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The question is raised as to the division point between the mind and the environment. The EMT proposes that some objects in the external environment are utilized by the [[mind]] in such a way that the objects can be seen as extensions of the mind itself. Specifically, the mind is seen to encompass every level of the cognitive process, which will often include the use of environmental aids.

==Criticism==

Philosophical arguments against the extended mind thesis include the following.&lt;ref name="Adams Aizawa"&gt;{{cite book | url=http://philpapers.org/rec/ADADTB | title=Defending the bounds of cognition, in The Extended Mind (Eds, Richard Menary) |author1=Adams, Fred. |author2=Aizawa, Ken | year=2010 | pages=67–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# When focusing on cognition, the thesis confuses claims about what is constitutive about the concept of cognition with claims about causal influences on cognition (the "causal-constitutional fallacy"). For example, Adams and Aizawa (2010) write, "Question: Why did the pencil think that 2 + 2 = 4?, Clark’s Answer: Because it was coupled to the mathematician." 
# It stretches the limits of our ordinary concept of cognition too far ("cognitive bloating"), potentially implying that everything on the Internet is part of individual cognitive systems.
# It uses a coarse-grained functionalism about the mind that ignores plausible differences between internal and external processes, such as differences between beliefs and external props and devices; or for creating a notion of cognition too heterogeneous to make up a scientific natural kind.

Each of these arguments is addressed in Clark (2008), in which he notes:&lt;ref name="Supersizing"&gt;{{cite book | title=Supersizing the Mind: Embodiment, Action, and Cognitive Extension | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Clark, Andy | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# While coupling is important for cognition, that is not to say that it is sufficient – the coupling must play a functional role in cognition. Many couplings do not do so and thus would not be 'extensions' (and this is consistent with a strong extended mind thesis).
# Any putative part of a system – internal or external – is unlikely to yield "cognition" on its own. Thus, examples such as calculators, pencils, should be considered in parallel with neural regions. Simply looking at the part is not enough for cognition.
# One can imagine circumstances under which a biological being might retain information in non-neural ways (a hypothetical Martian with a bitmap-based memory, or humans with prosthetics to support memory). Thus, being neural cannot be a necessary condition for being cognitive.

While in ''Supersizing the Mind'' Clark defends a strong version of the hypothesis of [[extended cognition]] (contrasted with a hypothesis of embedded cognition) in other work, some of these objections have inspired more moderate reformulations of the extended mind thesis. Thus, the extended mind thesis may no longer depend on the parity considerations of Clark and Chalmers' original argument but, instead, emphasize the "complementarity" of internal and external elements of cognitive systems or processes. This version might be understood as emphasizing the explanatory value of the extended mind thesis for cognitive science rather than maintaining it as an ontological claim about the nature of mind or cognition.&lt;ref name="Supersizing" /&gt;

'''Folk plays''' such as [[Hoodening]], [[Guising]], [[Mummers Play]] and [[Soul cake|Soul Caking]] are generally verse sketches performed in countryside pubs in European countries, private houses or the open air, at set times of the year such as the [[winter solstice|Winter]] or Summer [[solstice]]s or Christmas and New Year. Many have long traditions, although they are frequently updated to retain their relevance for modern audiences.

The '''foot''' (plural '''feet''') is an [[anatomical]] structure found in many [[vertebrates]]. It is the terminal portion of a limb which bears weight and allows [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]]. In many animals with feet, the foot is a separate organ at the terminal part of the [[leg]] made up of one or more segments or bones, generally including claws or nails.

==Etymology==
The word "foot", in the sense of meaning the "terminal part of the leg of a vertebrate animal" comes from "Old English fot "foot," from Proto-Germanic *fot (source also of Old Frisian fot, Old Saxon fot, Old Norse fotr, Danish fod, Swedish fot, Dutch voet, Old High German fuoz, German Fuß, Gothic fotus "foot"), from PIE root *ped- "foot." &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=foot |title=Foot |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=www.etymonline.com |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=20 May 2017 |quote= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802093751/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=foot |archivedate=2 August 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The "[p]lural form feet is an instance of i-mutation." &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The human foot is a strong and complex mechanical structure containing 26 [[bone]]s, 33 [[Joint (anatomy)|joints]] (20 of which are actively articulated), and more than a hundred [[muscle]]s, [[tendon]]s, and [[ligament]]s.&lt;ref name="Podiatry-Channel"&gt;Podiatry Channel, ''Anatomy of the foot and ankle''&lt;/ref&gt; The joints of the foot are the [[ankle]] and [[subtalar joint]] and the [[interphalangeal articulations of the foot]]. An anthropometric study of 1197 North American adult Caucasian males (mean age 35.5 years) found that a man's foot length was 26.3&amp;nbsp;cm with a [[standard deviation]] of 1.2&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hawes MR, Sovak D |title=Quantitative morphology of the human foot in a North American population |journal=Ergonomics |volume=37 |issue=7 |pages=1213–26 |date=July 1994 |pmid=8050406 |doi= 10.1080/00140139408964899|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foot can be subdivided into the hindfoot, the midfoot, and the forefoot:

The ''hindfoot'' is composed of the [[Talus bone|talus]] (or ankle bone) and the [[calcaneus]] (or heel bone). The two long bones of the lower leg, the [[tibia]] and [[fibula]], are connected to the top of the talus to form the [[ankle]]. Connected to the talus at the [[subtalar joint]], the calcaneus, the largest bone of the foot, is cushioned underneath by a layer of fat.&lt;ref name="Podiatry-Channel" /&gt;

The five irregular bones of the ''midfoot'', the [[Cuboid bone|cuboid]], [[Navicular bone|navicular]], and three [[Cuneiform (anatomy)|cuneiform]] bones, form the [[arches of the foot]] which serves as a shock absorber. The midfoot is connected to the hind- and fore-foot by muscles and the [[plantar fascia]].&lt;ref name="Podiatry-Channel" /&gt;

The ''forefoot'' is composed of five toes and the corresponding five proximal long bones forming the [[metatarsus]]. Similar to the fingers of the hand, the bones of the toes are called [[Phalanx bones|phalanges]] and the [[big toe]] has two phalanges while the other four toes have three phalanges each. The joints between the phalanges are called [[interphalangeal articulations of foot|interphalangeal]] and those between the metatarsus and phalanges are called [[metatarsophalangeal joint|metatarsophalangeal]] (MTP).&lt;ref name="Podiatry-Channel" /&gt;

{{anchor|dorsum}}
Both the midfoot and forefoot constitute the ''dorsum'' (the area facing upwards while standing) and the ''planum'' (the area facing downwards while standing).

{{anchor|instep}}

The ''instep'' is the arched part of the top of the foot between the toes and the ankle.

=== Bones ===
[[File:Blausen 0411 FootAnatomy.png|thumb|upright|Illustration of bones in lower leg and foot.]]

* [[tibia]], [[fibula]]
* [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]] (7): [[Talus bone|talus]], [[calcaneus]], [[Cuneiform (anatomy)|cuneiformes]] (3), [[Cuboid bone|cuboid]], and [[Navicular bone|navicular]]
* [[metatarsus]] (5): [[First metatarsal bone|first]], [[Second metatarsal bone|second]], [[Third metatarsal bone|third]], [[Fourth metatarsal bone|fourth]], and [[fifth metatarsal bone]]
* [[Phalanges of the foot|phalanges]] (14)

There can be many [[sesamoid bone]]s near the metatarsophalangeal joints, although they are only regularly present in the distal portion of the [[first metatarsal bone]].&lt;ref name="Platzer-220"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arches ===
{{Main|Arches of the foot}}
The human foot has two [[Anatomical terms of location|longitudinal]] arches and a transverse arch maintained by the interlocking shapes of the foot bones, strong ligaments, and pulling muscles during activity. The slight mobility of these arches when weight is applied to and removed from the foot makes walking and running more economical in terms of energy. As can be examined in a footprint, the medial longitudinal arch curves above the ground. This arch stretches from the heel bone over the "keystone" ankle bone to the three medial metatarsals. In contrast, the lateral longitudinal arch is very low. With the cuboid serving as its keystone, it redistributes part of the weight to the calcaneus and the distal end of the fifth metatarsal. The two longitudinal arches serve as pillars for the transverse arch which run obliquely across the tarsometatarsal joints. Excessive strain on the tendons and ligaments of the feet can result in fallen arches or [[flat feet]].&lt;ref name="Marieb-Hoehn-244"&gt;Mareb-Hoehn 2007, pp. 244–45&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Muscles ===
The muscles acting on the foot can be classified into extrinsic muscles, those originating on the anterior or posterior aspect of the lower leg, and intrinsic muscles, originating on the dorsal (top) or plantar (base) aspects of the foot.

==== Extrinsic ====
[[File:Gray437.png|thumb|80px|Anterior leg muscles.]]
All muscles originating on the lower leg except the [[popliteus muscle]] are attached to the bones of the foot. The tibia and fibula and the interosseous membrane separate these muscles into anterior and posterior groups, in their turn subdivided into subgroups and layers.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-256"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt;

''Anterior group''

''Extensor group'': [[Tibialis anterior muscle|tibialis anterior]] originates on the proximal half of the tibia and the interosseous membrane and is inserted near the [[tarsometatarsal joint]] of the first digit. In the non-weight-bearing leg tibialis anterior flexes the foot dorsally and lift its medial edge ([[supination]]). In the weight-bearing leg it brings the leg towards the back of the foot, like in rapid walking. [[Extensor digitorum longus muscle|Extensor digitorum longus]] arises on the lateral tibial condyle and along the fibula to be inserted on the second to fifth digits and proximally on the fifth metatarsal. The extensor digitorum longus acts similar to the tibialis anterior except that it also dorsiflexes the digits. [[Extensor hallucis longus muscle|Extensor hallucis longus]] originates medially on the fibula and is inserted on the first digit. As the name implies it dorsiflexes the big toe and also acts on the ankle in the unstressed leg. In the weight-bearing leg it acts similar to the tibialis anterior.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-258"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;

''Peroneal group'': [[Peroneus longus muscle|peroneus longus]] arises on the proximal aspect of the fibula and [[Peroneus brevis muscle|peroneus brevis]] below it on the same bone. Together, their tendons pass behind the lateral [[malleolus]]. Distally, peroneus longus crosses the plantar side of the foot to reach its insertion on the first tarsometatarsal joint, while peroneus brevis reaches the proximal part of the fifth metatarsal. These two muscles are the strongest pronators and aid in plantar flexion. Longus also acts like a bowstring that braces the transverse arch of the foot.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-260"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|right|Gray438.png|100|Gray439.png|80|Deep and superficial layers of posterior leg muscles}}
''Posterior group''

The ''superficial layer'' of posterior leg muscles is formed by the [[triceps surae]] and the [[Plantaris muscle|plantaris]]. The triceps surae consists of the [[Soleus muscle|soleus]] and the two heads of the [[Gastrocnemius muscle|gastrocnemius]]. The heads of gastrocnemius arise on the [[femur]], proximal to the condyles, and soleus arises on the proximal dorsal parts of the tibia and fibula. The tendons of these muscles merge to be inserted onto the calcaneus as the [[Achilles tendon]]. Plantaris originates on the femur proximal to the lateral head of the gastrocnemius and its long tendon is embedded medially into the Achilles tendon. The triceps surae is the primary plantar flexor and its strength becomes most obvious during ballet dancing. It is fully activated only with the knee extended because the gastrocnemius is shortened during knee flexion. During walking it not only lifts the heel, but also flexes the knee, assisted by the plantaris.&lt;ref name="Platzer-262"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''deep layer'' of posterior muscles [[Tibialis posterior muscle|tibialis posterior]] arises proximally on the back of the interosseous membrane and adjoining bones and divides into two parts in the sole of the foot to attach to the tarsus. In the non-weight-bearing leg, it produces plantar flexion and supination, and, in the weight-bearing leg, it proximates the heel to the calf. [[Flexor hallucis longus muscle|flexor hallucis longus]] arises on the back of the fibula (i.e. on the lateral side), and its relatively thick muscle belly extends distally down to the [[flexor retinaculum of foot|flexor retinaculum]] where it passes over to the medial side to stretch across the sole to the distal phalanx of the first digit. The [[Popliteus muscle|popliteus]] is also part of this group, but, with its oblique course across the back of the knee, does not act on the foot.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-264"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Intrinsic ====
On the ''back'' (top) ''of the foot'', the tendons of [[Extensor digitorum brevis muscle|extensor digitorum brevis]] and [[Extensor hallucis brevis muscle|extensor hallucis brevis]] lie deep to the system of long extrinsic extensor tendons. They both arise on the calcaneus and extend into the dorsal [[aponeurosis]] of digits one to four, just beyond the penultimate joints. They act to dorsiflex the digits.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-268"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

{{triple image|right|Gray443.png|83|Gray444.png|91|Gray445.png|100|Plantar aspects of foot, varying depths (superficial to deep)}}

Similar to the intrinsic muscles of the hand, there are three groups of muscles in the ''sole of foot'', those of the first and last digits, and a central group:

''Muscles of the [[Hallux|big toe]]'': [[Abductor hallucis muscle|abductor hallucis]] stretches medially along the border of the sole, from the calcaneus to the first digit. Below its tendon, the tendons of the long flexors pass through the [[Tarsal tunnel|tarsal canal]]. It is an abductor and a weak flexor, and also helps maintain the arch of the foot. [[Flexor hallucis brevis muscle|flexor hallucis brevis]] arises on the medial cuneiform bone and related ligaments and tendons. An important plantar flexor, it is crucial for ballet dancing. Both these muscles are inserted with two heads proximally and distally to the first metatarsophalangeal joint. [[Adductor hallucis muscle|Adductor hallucis]] is part of this group, though it originally formed a separate system (see [[contrahens]].) It has two heads, the oblique head originating obliquely across the central part of the midfoot, and the transverse head originating near the metatarsophalangeal joints of digits five to three. Both heads are inserted into the lateral sesamoid bone of the first digit. Adductor hallucis acts as a tensor of the plantar arches and also adducts the big toe and then might plantar flex the proximal phalanx.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-270"&gt;Platzer 2004, pp. 270–72&lt;/ref&gt;

''Muscles of the [[Fifth toe|little toe]]'': Stretching laterally from the calcaneus to the proximal phalanx of the fifth digit, [[Abductor digiti minimi muscle (foot)|abductor digiti minimi]] form the lateral margin of the foot and is the largest of the muscles of the fifth digit. Arising from the base of the fifth metatarsal, [[flexor digiti minimi brevis muscle (foot)|flexor digiti minimi]] is inserted together with abductor on the first phalanx. Often absent, [[Opponens digiti minimi muscle|opponens digiti minimi]] originates near the cuboid bone and is inserted on the fifth metatarsal bone. These three muscles act to support the arch of the foot and to plantar flex the fifth digit.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-272"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|right|Gray446.png|100|Gray447.png|100|Central muscles of foot}}
''Central muscle group'': The four [[Lumbrical muscle (foot)|lumbricals]] arise on the medial side of the tendons of flexor digitorum longus and are inserted on the medial margins of the proximal phalanges. [[Quadratus plantae muscle|Quadratus plantae]] originates with two slips from the lateral and medial margins of the calcaneus and inserts into the lateral margin of the flexor digitorum tendon. It is also known as flexor accessorius. [[Flexor digitorum brevis muscle|Flexor digitorum brevis]] arise inferiorly on the calcaneus and its three tendons are inserted into the middle phalanges of digits two to four (sometimes also the fifth digit). These tendons divide before their insertions and the tendons of flexor digitorum longus pass through these divisions. Flexor digitorum brevis flexes the middle phalanges. It is occasionally absent. Between the toes, the [[Dorsal interossei muscles (foot)|dorsal]] and [[Plantar interossei muscles|plantar interossei]] stretch from the metatarsals to the proximal phalanges of digits two to five. The plantar interossei adducts and the dorsal interossei abducts these digits and are also plantar flexors at the metatarsophalangeal joints.
&lt;ref name="Platzer-274"&gt;Platzer 2004, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical significance==
{{Main|Diseases of the foot}}
Due to their position and function, feet are exposed to a [[List of disorders of foot and ankle|variety]] of potential [[infection]]s and [[injuries]], including [[athlete's foot]], [[bunion]]s, [[Ingrown nail|ingrown toenails]], [[Morton's neuroma]], [[plantar fasciitis]], [[plantar wart]]s and [[stress fracture]]s. In addition, there are several [[genetic disorder]]s that can affect the shape and function of the feet, including a [[club foot]] or [[flat feet]].

This leaves humans more vulnerable to medical problems that are caused by poor leg and foot alignments. Also, the wearing of shoes, sneakers and boots can impede proper alignment and movement within the ankle and foot. For example, [[High-heeled footwear]] are known to throw off the [[neutral spine|natural weight balance]] (this can also affect the lower back). For the sake of posture, flat soles with no heels are advised.

A [[physician|doctor]] who specializes in the treatment of the feet practices [[podiatry]] and is called a podiatrist. A [[pedorthist]] specializes in the use and modification of footwear to treat problems related to the lower limbs.

{{anchor|fracture}}&lt;!--"Foot fracture" redirects here--&gt;
[[Bone fracture|Fracture]]s of the foot include:
*[[Lisfranc fracture]]&amp;nbsp;– in which one or all of the [[metatarsal]]s are displaced from the [[Tarsus (skeleton)|tarsus]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Lisfranc%27s+fracture TheFreeDictionary &gt; Lisfranc's fracture] Citing: Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jones fracture]]&amp;nbsp;– a fracture of the [[fifth metatarsal]]
*[[March fracture]]&amp;nbsp;– a fracture of the distal third of one of the metatarsals occurring because of recurrent stress
*[[Calcaneal fracture]]

{{anchor|sweat}}&lt;!--"Foot sweat" redirects here--&gt;
Foot [[sweat]] is the major cause of [[foot odor]]. Sweat itself is odorless, but it creates a beneficial environment for certain bacteria to grow and produce bad-smelling substances.

==Pronation==
{{main|Pronation of the foot}}
In anatomy, [[pronation]] is a rotational movement of the forearm (at the radioulnar joint) or foot (at the subtalar and talocalcaneonavicular joints). Pronation of the foot refers to how the body distributes weight as it cycles through the [[gait]]. During the gait cycle the foot can pronate in many different ways based on rearfoot and forefoot function. Types of pronation include neutral pronation,  underpronation (supination), and overpronation.

;Neutral pronation
An individual who neutrally pronates initially strikes the ground on the [[Human Anatomical Terms#Anatomical directions|lateral]] side of the [[heel]]. As the individual transfers weight from the heel to the [[metatarsus]], the foot will roll in a [[Human Anatomical Terms#Anatomical directions|medial]] direction, such that the weight is distributed evenly across the metatarsus. In this stage of the gait, the [[knee]] will generally, but not always, track directly over the [[hallux]].

This rolling inwards motion as the foot progresses from heel to toe is the way that the body naturally absorbs shock. Neutral pronation is the most ideal, efficient type of gait when using a [[heel strike (gait)|heel strike]] gait; in a forefoot strike, the body absorbs shock instead via flexation of the foot.

;Overpronation
As with a neutral pronator, an individual who overpronates initially strikes the ground on the lateral side of the heel. As the individual transfers weight from the heel to the metatarsus, however, the foot will roll too far in a medial direction, such that the weight is distributed unevenly across the metatarsus, with excessive weight borne on the [[hallux]]. In this stage of the gait, the knee will generally, but not always, track inwards.

An overpronator does not absorb shock efficiently. Imagine someone jumping onto a diving board, but the board is so flimsy that when it is struck, it bends and allows the person to plunge straight down into the water instead of back into the air. Similarly, an overpronator's arches will collapse, or the ankles will roll inwards (or a combination of the two) as they cycle through the gait. An individual whose bone structure involves [[external rotation]] at the [[hip]], knee, or [[ankle]] will be more likely to overpronate than one whose bone structure has [[internal rotation]] or central alignment. An individual who overpronates tends to wear down their running shoes on the medial (inside) side of the shoe towards the toe area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.runnersworld.com/running-shoes/overpronation-explained?page=single | work = Runner's World | date = 21 September 2001 | title = Overpronation, Explained | accessdate = 28 December 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130924213417/http://www.runnersworld.com/running-shoes/overpronation-explained?page=single | archivedate = 24 September 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When choosing a running or walking shoe, a person with overpronation can choose shoes that have good inside support—usually by strong material at the inside sole and arch of the shoe.  It is usually visible.  The inside support area is marked by strong greyish material to support the weight when a person lands on the outside foot and then roll onto the inside foot.

;Underpronation (supination)

[[File:Underpronation.jpg|thumb|Underpronation of foot]]
An individual who underpronates also initially strikes the ground on the lateral side of the heel. As the individual transfers weight from the heel to the metatarsus, the foot will not roll far enough in a medial direction. The weight is distributed unevenly across the metatarsus, with excessive weight borne on the [[fifth metatarsal]], towards the lateral side of the foot. In this stage of the gait, the knee will generally, but not always, track laterally of the [[hallux]].

Like an overpronator, an underpronator does not absorb shock efficiently&amp;nbsp;– but for the opposite reason. The underpronated foot is like a diving board that, instead of failing to spring someone in the air because it is too flimsy, fails to do so because it is too rigid. There is virtually no give. An underpronator's arches or ankles don't experience much motion as they cycle through the gait. An individual whose bone structure involves [[internal rotation]] at the hip, knee, or ankle will be more likely to underpronate than one whose bone structure has external rotation or central alignment. Usually&amp;nbsp;– but not always&amp;nbsp;– those who are [[bow-legged]] tend to underpronate.{{Citation needed|reason=some sources say instead that those who are bow-legged tend to overpronate|date=November 2013}} An individual who underpronates tends to wear down their running shoes on the lateral (outside) side of the shoe towards the rear of the shoe in the heel area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.runnersworld.com/running-shoes/supination-explained?page=single | work = Runner's World | date = 21 September 2001 | title = Supination, Explained | accessdate = 28 December 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130917160412/http://www.runnersworld.com/running-shoes/supination-explained?page=single | archivedate = 17 September 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
Humans usually wear [[shoe]]s or similar footwear for protection from hazards when walking outside. There are a number of contexts where it is considered inappropriate to wear shoes. Some people consider it rude to wear shoes into a house and a [[Māori people|Māori]] [[Marae]] should only be entered with bare feet.

[[Foot fetishism]] is the most common form of sexual fetish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/rex-ryans-foot-video-not-necessarily-unhealthy/story?id=12467617 |title=Rex Ryan's Apparent Foot Fetish Not Necessarily Unhealthy |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2010-12-23 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chaimedia.com/list/197.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101215643/http://www.chaimedia.com/list/197.html |archivedate=2012-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
{{Main|Comparative foot morphology}}

A [[paw]] is the soft foot of a mammal, generally a quadruped, that has claws or nails (e.g., a cat or dog's paw). A hard foot is called a [[hoof]]. Depending on style of locomotion, animals can be classified as [[plantigrade]] (sole walking), [[digitigrade]] (toe walking), or [[unguligrade]] (nail walking).

The metatarsals are the bones that make up the main part of the foot in humans, and part of the leg in large animals or paw in smaller animals. The number of metatarsals are directly related to the mode of locomotion with many larger animals having their digits reduced to two ([[elk]], [[cow]], [[sheep]]) or one ([[horse]]). The metatarsal bones of feet and paws are tightly grouped compared to, most notably, the human hand where the thumb metacarpal diverges from the rest of the metacarpus.&lt;ref name="France-537"&gt;France 2008, p. 537&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphorical and cultural usage==
[[File:Study of a pair of feet crossed at the ankles RMG PY5986.tiff|thumb|Study of a pair of feet crossed, 1847, by Margaret Louisa Herschel, daughter of [[John Herschel]], from the [[Royal Museums Greenwich]]]]
The word "foot" is used to refer to a "...linear measure was in Old English (the exact length has varied over time), this being considered the length of a man's foot; a unit of measure used widely and anciently. In this sense the plural is often foot. The current inch and foot are implied from measurements in 12c." &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
The word "foot" also has a musical meaning; a "...metrical foot (late Old English, translating Latin pes, Greek pous in the same sense) is commonly taken to represent one rise and one fall of a foot: keeping time according to some, dancing according to others."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The word "foot" was used in Middle English to mean "a person" (c. 1200).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
The expression "...to put one's best foot foremost first recorded 1849 (Shakespeare has the better foot before, 1596)".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The expression to "...put one's foot in (one's) mouth "say something stupid" was first used in 1942.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The expression "put (one's) foot in something" meaning to "make a mess of it" was used in 1823.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The word "footloose" was first used in the 1690s, meaning "free to move the feet, unshackled"; the more "figurative sense of "free to act as one pleases" was first used in 1873.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Like "footloose", "flat-footed" at first had its obvious literal meaning (in 1600, it meant "with flat feet") but by 1912 it meant "unprepared" (U.S. baseball slang).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

A '''fractional-horsepower motor''' ('''FHP''') is an [[electric motor]] with a rated output power of 746.9 or 746 [[Watt]]s or less. There is no defined minimum output, however, it is generally accepted that a motor with a frame size of less than 35mm square can be referred to as a 'micro-motor'.

The term 'fractional' indicates that the motor often has a power rating smaller than one [[horsepower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fractionalhorsepowermotors.com/| title=Fractional Horsepower Motor Manufacturers| accessdate= 25 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fractional-horsepower electric motors are exempt from the US [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]] and the new EN 60034-30:2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cemep.org/index.php?id=53]&lt;/ref&gt; ruling of European directive 2005/32/EC&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/eco_design/directive_2005_32.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; concerning the efficiency classes of low-voltage three-phase [[asynchronous motor]]s.

==History==
The earliest commercially-successful electric motors date back to the latter part of the 19th century when [[Nikola Tesla]] patented his [[induction motor]] in 1888. The development of fractional-[[horsepower]] motors, however, would not have taken place without the push toward urban, and later, rural electrification, using alternating current. Electrification began in cities around 1915, and with electrification, so too came the potential market for washing machines, refrigerators, vacuum cleaners and a host of other commercial appliances. This was recognised by major manufacturers, like Westinghouse and General Electric, who were already in the business of manufacturing large motors for industrial installations. By 1920, over 500,000 fractional-horsepower motors were powering washers and other appliances in America.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond McInnis, A history of the amateur woodworking movement; Appendix 21 http://www.woodworkinghistory.com/appendix_21.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E T Painton Small Electric Motors DC and AC London: Pitman, 1923&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George A Schock, Early History of Baldor Electric Co, 1920-1976. Fort Smith, Arkansas: Baldor Electric Co, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

After the second world war, the demand for FHP motors grew, particularly throughout the consumerist boom of the 1950s and 60's. In 2000, the European FHP market was worth an estimated $4.5 billion with some 300-million units in manufacture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Frost and Sullivan, European Fractional Horse Power Motors Market, 17 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Precision motors==
[[Servo motors]] and [[stepper motors]] are specialist types of fractional-[[horsepower]] [[electric motor]]s usually intended for high-precision or robotics applications. Usually running from a DC supply, when combined with a [[planetary gear]]box can offer accuracies less than 8 arc-minutes (&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;ths&lt;/sup&gt; of a degree, or approx. 2.3 [[milliradian]]s). Due to their specialized nature, however, these types of motors tend to be expensive compared with standard, or general-purpose lower-precision units.

==Applications==
Fractional-horsepower motors are used across a wide range of industries and applications for a variety of motion and compression needs. The largest portion of sales can be attributed to the automotive sector, however, accounting for some 35% of all FHP motor sales,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; driving auxiliary applications such as electric windows, wind-shield wipers, powered seats, wing mirrors, central locking systems, roof openers, and trunk openers. In Europe, the majority of these applications are fulfilled by the industry's largest players: Brose (formerly [[Siemens]]), [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], and Nidec (formerly Valeo).

The second-largest area of consumption is the field of [[white goods]], and small domestic appliances (approximately 12% of the European market). For example, FHP motors are being used to drive pumps and compressors in refrigerators, coffee machines, and washing machines, and they provide suction in vacuum cleaners and a variety of other switching and motion tasks across the ever-increasing variety of domestic products. Until the recent divestment of its motors interests, [[Electrolux]] was believed to be Europe's largest manufacturer of FHP motors for domestic-appliance applications.

Industrial applications consume a similar number of units to that of domestic products with FHP motors being used across a variety of conveyance and process applications.

Other applications include: pumps &amp; compressors, medical devices, portable tools, office machinery, and [[HVAC]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5527">'''Freezing tolerance''' describes the ability of plants to withstand subzero temperatures through the formation of ice crystals in the [[xylem]] and intercellular space, or [[apoplast]], of their cells. Freezing tolerance is enhanced as a gradual adaptation to low temperature through a process known as cold acclimation, which initiates the transition to prepare for subzero temperatures through alterations in rate of metabolism, hormone levels and sugars.&lt;ref&gt;Hon, W. C., M. Griffith, A. Mlynarz, Y. C. Kwok, and D. S. Yang. 1995. Antifreze proteins in winter rye are similar to pathogenesis-related proteins. Plant Physiology. 109: 879-889.&lt;/ref&gt; Freezing tolerance is rapidly enhanced during the first days of the cold acclimation process when temperature drops. Depending on the plant species, maximum freezing tolerance can be reached after only two weeks of exposure to low temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilmour|first=Sarah J.|last2=Hajela|first2=Ravindra K.|last3=Thomashow|first3=Michael F.|date=1988-07-01|title=Cold Acclimation in Arabidopsis thaliana1|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=87|issue=3|pages=745–750|issn=0032-0889|pmc=1054832|pmid=16666219|doi=10.1104/pp.87.3.745}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to control intercellular ice formation during freezing is critical to the survival of freeze-tolerant plants.&lt;ref&gt;Yaish, M. W., A. C. Doxey, B. J. McConkey, B. A. Moffatt, and M. Griffith. 2006. Cold-active winter rye glucanases with ice-binding capacity. Plant Physiology. 141: 1459-1472.&lt;/ref&gt; If intracellular ice forms, it could be lethal to the plant when adhesion between cellular membranes and walls occur. The process of freezing tolerance through cold acclimation is a two-stage mechanism:&lt;ref&gt;Thomashow. M. 1998. Role of cold-responsive genes in plant freezing tolerance. Plant Physiology. 118: 11-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

* The first stage occurs at relatively high subzero temperatures as the water present in plant tissues freezes outside the cell.  
* The second stage occurs at lower temperatures as intercellular ice continues to form.

Within the [[apoplast]], [[antifreeze protein]]s localize the growth of ice crystals by ice nucleators in order to prevent physical damage to tissues and to promote supercooling within freezing-sensitive tissues and cells. [[Osmotic stress]], including dehydration, high salinity, as well as treatment with [[abscisic acid]], can also enhance freezing tolerance.

Freezing tolerance can be assessed by performing a simple plant survival assay or with the more time consuming but quantitative electrolyte leakage assay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitlow|first=Thomas H.|last2=Bassuk|first2=Nina L.|last3=Ranney|first3=Thomas G.|last4=Reichert|first4=Deborah L.|date=1992-01-01|title=An Improved Method for Using Electrolyte Leakage to Assess Membrane Competence in Plant Tissues|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=98|issue=1|pages=198–205|issn=0032-0889|pmc=1080169|pmid=16668614|doi=10.1104/pp.98.1.198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants are not the only organisms capable of withstanding subzero temperatures. Wood frogs, juvenile painted turtles, goldenrod gall fly larvae, and intertidal periwinkle snails have all been shown to be capable of the same. They convert up to 70% of their total body water into ice accumulating in extracellular spaces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Storey |first1=K.B. |last2=Storey |first2=J.M. |title=Molecular physiology of freeze tolerance in vertebrates |journal=Physiological Reviews |date=2017 |volume=97 |issue=2 |pages=623-665 |doi=10.1002/cphy.c130007 |pmid=28179395}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In order to perform such remarkable acts, several biochemical adaptations have been identified as supporting factors to freeze tolerance. These include the following:
* Proteins: Nucleating proteins induce and regulate the whole process of extracellular freezing. Certain proteins, named ice restructuring proteins or antifreeze proteins, stop small ice crystals from recrystallizing into larger crystals that can cause phyiscal damage to tissues. 
* Cryoprotectants: These are several factors that prevent intracellular freezing, prevent excessive reduction of cell volume, and stabilize protein conformation. This most commonly include high concentrations of polyhidric alcohols (glycerol, sorbitol) and sugars (glucose) that are packed into the cell. Other protectants are trehalose and proline which prevent the membrane bilayer from collapsing.
* Ischemia tolerance:: in order for cells and organs to survive without circulation of the blood, good antioxidant defenses and elevated chaperone proteins are required. They help protect cell macromolecules, whilst metabolic rate depression greatly reduces cell energy needed whilst frozen.  
New work in the field focuses primarily on four different topics &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Storey |first1=K.B. |title=Freeze Tolerance |url=https://www.kenstoreylab.com/research/freeze-tolerance/ |website=The Storey Lab: Cell and Molecular Responses to Stress |accessdate=November 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These include:
* Identification of novel genes and their protein products found in freeze tolerant species.
* Exploration of a huge range of other genes/proteins that address many different issues in cell preservation and viability.
* Studies of important transcription factors that mediate the freeze-tolerance response. 
* Analysis of biochemical mechanisms that regulate gene and protein expression in regards to microRNA, protein phosphorylation, and epigenetic controls.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5436">In [[population biology]] and [[demography]], the '''generation time''' is the average time between two consecutive generations in the lineages of a [[population]]. In human populations, the generation time typically ranges from 22 to 33 years.&lt;ref name="OECD2015" /&gt; [[Historian]]s sometimes use this to date events, by converting generations into years to obtain rough estimates of time.

== Definitions and corresponding formulas ==

The existing definitions of the generation time fall into two categories: those that treat the generation time as a renewal time of the population, and those that focus on the distance between individuals of one generation and the next. Below are the three most commonly used definitions:&lt;ref name="Coale1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Charlesworth1994" /&gt;

=== The time it takes for the population to grow by a factor of its net reproductive rate ===

The [[net reproduction rate|net reproductive rate]] ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of offspring an individual is expected to produce during its lifetime (a net reproductive rate of 1 means that the population is at its demographic equilibrium). This definition envisions the generation time as a renewal time of the population. It justifies the very simple definition used in [[microbiology]] ("the time it takes for the population to double", or [[doubling time]]) since one can consider that during the exponential phase of bacterial growth mortality is very low and as a result a [[bacterium]] is expected to be replaced by two bacteria in the next generation (the mother cell and the daughter cell). If the population dynamic is exponential with a growth rate ''r'' (i.e. ''n''(''t'') ~ α.e&lt;sup&gt;''rt''&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n''(''t'') is the size of the population at time ''t''), then this measure of the generation time is 
given by:
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\log R_0}{r}&lt;/math&gt;.
Indeed, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle T&lt;/math&gt; is such that ''n''(''t'' + ''T'') = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''n''(''t''), i.e. e&lt;sup&gt;''rT''&lt;/sup&gt; = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== The average difference in age between parent and offspring ===

This definition is a measure of the distance between generations rather than a renewal time of the population. Since many demographic models are female-based (that is, they only take females into account), this definition is often expressed as a mother-daughter distance (the "average age of mothers at birth of their daughters"). However, it is also possible to define a father-son distance (average age of fathers at the birth of their sons) or not to take sex into account at all in the definition. In age-structured population models, an expression is given by:&lt;ref name="Coale1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Charlesworth1994" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \int_0^{\infty} x e^{-rx} \ell(x) m(x) \, \mathrm{d}x&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''r'' is the growth rate of the population, ''ℓ''(''x'') is the survivorship function (probability that an individual survives to age ''x'') and ''m''(''x'') the maternity function (or birth function, or age-specific fertility). For [[matrix population models]], there is a general formula:&lt;ref name="BienvenuLegendre2015" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{ \lambda \mathbf{v w}}{\mathbf{v F w}} = \frac{1}{\sum e_{\lambda}(f_{ij})}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''λ'' = e&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt; is the discrete-time growth rate of the population, '''F''' = (''f&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'') is its fertility matrix, '''v''' its reproductive value (row-vector) and '''w''' its stable stage distribution (column-vector); the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle e_{\lambda}(f_{ij}) = \frac{f_{ij}}{\lambda} \frac{\partial \lambda}{\partial f_{ij}}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Elasticity of a function|elasticities]] of ''λ'' to the fertilities.

=== The age at which members of a given cohort are expected to reproduce ===

This definition is very similar to the previous one but the population need not be at its stable age distribution. Moreover, it can be computed for different cohorts and thus provides more information about the generation time in the population. This measure is given by:&lt;ref name="Coale1972" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Charlesworth1994" /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{\int_{x=0}^{\infty} x \ell(x) m(x) \, \mathrm{d}x}{\int_{x=0}^{\infty} \ell(x) m(x) \, \mathrm{d}x}&lt;/math&gt;.
Indeed, the numerator is the sum of the ages at which a member of the cohort reproduces, and the denominator is  ''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the average number of offspring it produces.

'''Guillermo Morphy y Ferríz de Guzmán''', best known as '''Conde Morphy''' or '''Count Morphy''' (February 29, 1836 – August 27, 1899 in Madrid) was a Spanish aristocrat, music critic, musicologist, historian, educator, composer and politician. He became personal secretary to King [[Alfonso XII of Spain]] in 1875. He became a highly admired figure in artistic circles of late nineteenth century Madrid, and for his service to the Crown of Spain. He was a friend of [[Isaac Albéniz]], who he arranged a grant for to study at the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]]. He served as director of the Royal Concert Society at the [[Teatro Real]] in Madrid until 1891.

==Biography==
Born in Madrid on February 29, 1836, he was of Irish descent, son of Joseph Morphy.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filomusica.com/filo49/bayreuth.html|title=Guillermo Morphy|publisher=Filomusica.com|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent his childhood traveling through France, Italy and Germany, among other countries, where he had a European renaissance education becoming a lover of art and literature. He lived for two years in Germany between 1846 and 1848.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|2002|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1858, he took over his father's law firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qlinks.net/FamilyHistory/d0000/g0000032.html#I582|title=Guillermo MORPHY Y FERRIZ DE GUZMAN (Conde de)|publisher=Qlinks.net|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863 he took classes under the composer [[François-Joseph Fétis]] in Brussels.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 7"&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|1998|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned he entered the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] on November 28, 1863 as a gentleman of the then Prince of Asturias and future King [[Alfonso XII of Spain]], a position he held until the Revolution in 1868 that overthrew [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel II]].&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt;

He moved to France to engage in musicology, and during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] he traveled to [[Vienna]] to be with Prince Alfonso. There he composed the opera ''Lizzie'' and other orchestral parts.&lt;ref name= "boileau-music.com p. "&gt;{{harvnb|boileau-music.com|2012|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the [[Bourbon Restoration]], he returned to Spain with the King, who appointed him his personal secretary on January 18, 1875 and granted him the title Count Morphy on May 3, 1882.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Ruvigny-Massue-Ruvigny p. 352"&gt;{{harvnb|Ruvigny|Massue|Ruvigny|2000| p=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published several studies and translated into Spanish a biography of [[Beethoven]], and in 1892 entered the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of San Fernando. He also served as director of the [[Royal Concert Society]] at the [[Teatro Real]] in Madrid until 1891.

Morphy was also an acquaintance and benefactor of several notable musicians of the time, such as [[Tomás Bretón]], [[Pablo Casals]] and [[Isaac Albéniz]].&lt;ref name= "boileau-music.com p. "/&gt; The count was a close friend of Albéniz in particular and was highly enthusiastic towards his talent,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaudiallgaudi.com/AM005albeniz.htm|title=Albéniz|publisher=Gaudiallgaudi.com|accessdate=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was Morphy who arranged for a grant for him to study at the [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels]].&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt; Morphy also arranged for violinist [[Enrique Fernández Arbós]] to study under [[Henri Vieuxtemps]] in Brussels.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 36"/&gt; Albéniz dedicated his composition ''[[Sevilla (Albéniz)|Sevilla]]'' to Count Morphy's wife when he premiered in a piano performance in Paris on January 24, 1886.&lt;ref name= "Clark p. 69"&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|2002|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In late 1883, a number of musicians, led by Count Morphy, sharing the same concerns regarding the regeneration of Spanish art, gathered together in a society in Madrid to found the Philharmonic Institute with the aim of offering musical training at the same level as other European centres. The regenerative nature of their educational project, compared to the teachings of the Conservatory of Madrid, is highlighted. In particular, the bel canto school run by Napoleón Verger helped to improve the standard of singing in Spain and to endow opera stages with renowned figures, thus paving the way for the establishment of Spanish lyric drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=García Álvarez de la Villa |first1=Beatriz |title=El Instituto Filarmónico |journal=Cuadernos de Música Iberoamericana |date=2016 |volume=29 |pages=81–109}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1886 to 1895, the Count of Morphy assumed a leading role as president of the Fine Arts section, he engaged with the activities of the society by giving lectures and by introducing the Ateneo to his own aesthetic principles, including his regenerationist agenda and his musical nationalism. He also extended invitations to some of the most relevant international figures and to a young generation of Spanish artists, with the intention of bringing the public closer to the European cultural scene. The Ateneo experienced a period of splendor with a new impulse in vocal, instrumental and chamber music, and a renewed repertoire with contemporary works by Spanish and Central European composers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=García Álvarez de la Villa |first1=Beatriz |title=Regeneracionismo musical en el Ateneo de Madrid bajo la presidencia del Conde de Morphy (1886-1895) |journal=Revista de Musicología |volume=40 |date=2017 |issue=vol.

== Science Dive Program ==
The Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory was founded in cooperation with U. S. government's [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) in 1980.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/HURL/about.html|title=About Us|publisher=Hawaiʻi Undersea Research Laboratory|accessdate=January 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; HURL became a regional center in NOAA’s [[National Undersea Research Program]] (NURP). The University of Hawaii had been donated the submersible ''Makali’i'' (formerly ''Star II''), which launched HURL’s science dive program on July 14, 1981, with its first dive into the Oak Crater in Eniwetok Atoll. This three-month long expedition included scientists from the Defense Nuclear Agency, Lawrence Livermore Labs, and the Air Force Weapons Agency to conduct research on the effects of nuclear testing.&lt;ref&gt;Hawaii Undersea Research Lab Website. Accomplishments. http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/HURL/science/accomplishments.html&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1981, they spent nearly 9,000 hours underwater around the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2011/20110405_hurl.html|title=Students nationwide virtually participate in Hawaii Undersea Research Laboratory's 1,000th Pisces submersible dive|date=2011-04-05|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; HURL has facilitated the long-term study of the [[Lōʻihi Seamount|Lo’ihi]] submarine volcano since 1987 and has analyzed its unique ecosystem and documented the growth of this new Hawaiian Island including investigation the collapse event in 1996. In 2005, they conducted a five-month expedition from Honolulu, Hawaii to New Zealand along the Tonga-[[Kermadec Islands|Kermadec]] arc during which they conducted 78 submersible dives and explored 13 different active volcanoes, 12 of which had never been explored before. In 2011, HURL made the first two-sub dive into Lo’ihi’s pit crater for a [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] documentary and celebrated 1,000 dives with the Pisces submersibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ouramazingplanet.com/hawaii-undersea-dive-110406-1342/|title=Submersible Completes 1,000th Dive Off Hawaii|date=2011-04-06|publisher=OurAmazingPlanet|accessdate=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of March in 2012, NOAA zeroed out all funding to HURL and closed down its National Undersea Research Center (NURC, formerly NURP). All program assets owned by NOAA were gifted to the University of Hawaii.  The lab continued to operate on residual funding and on what limited funding that the University of Hawaii could provide. Anticipating this decline in funding, HURL resurrected some of their old technology by placing their Launch, Recovery, and Transport (LRT) back into service. The LRT-12 and the LRT-30a were submersible pontoon barges, that were used from 1981-1996 to launch the ''Makali’i'' and the ''Pisces'' ''V'' respectfully before the arrival of University of Hawaii research ship, ''Kai’imi’kai o’ Kanaloa'' (KOK). By returning to operating of the LRT-30a, the lab was able to reduce their day rate by nearly 70%, thus making them more attractive to potential customers. HURL continued to operate through the 2013 and 2014 dive seasons logging another 46 dives. Maritime Heritage and documentary dives contributed more needed financing, but it was evident that the University of Hawaii would be unable to financially carry the program for any duration without more outside support. By January 1, 2015, nearly all of HURL’s staff had been let go leaving only a few personnel to maintain the two submersibles.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;University of Hawai’I Undersea Research Lab@SOEST. HURL in Transition. https://www.unols.org/sites/default/files/201612desap19.pdfhttp://www.kitv.com/story/3144&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, a proposed science expedition to China had emerged, allowing HURL to proceed with its required refit on the ''Pisces IV'' and the addition of more operations personnel. The project was scheduled for March to July 2016. However, after completing their series of test dives and within two days of their scheduled departure, the project was “put on hold” indefinitely due to “increased tensions in the South China Sea”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the fall of 2016, new interest in the submersibles led to the first dives on [[Geologists Seamounts|Cook and McCall Seamounts]] and a return visit to the [[Lōʻihi Seamount|Lo’ihi Volcano]] funded by [[Conservation International]]. This successful exploration was immediately followed by two expeditions funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) to the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands|Northwest Hawaiian Islands]] and [[Hawaiian–Emperor seamount chain|Emperor Seamounts]] in 2016 and 2017 consisting of 24 and 53 coral survey dives.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hawaii Undersea Research Lab Archives. HURL Dives 1981 to Present.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Maritime Heritage Discoveries and Ordnance Surveys'' ===
[[File:Japanese mini sub.jpg|alt=Underwater image of the Japanese mini sub involved in the attack on Pearl Harbor. It was first discovered by HURL sunk off the south shore of Oahu.|thumb|Underwater image of the Japanese mini sub involved in the attack on Pearl Harbor.

On December 6, 1984 the submersible ''Makali’i'' came upon a fully intact Douglas SDB-5 Dauntless dive bomber. This aircraft was found 213 m deep off [[Koko Head]], Oahu during a science dive studying deep invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;Hawaii Undersea Research Lab Archives. Maritime Heritage Database.&lt;/ref&gt; The aircraft was videoed, surveyed, and subsequently its history was researched. The discovery kick-started a side program within the lab to continue the documenting the wreck sites of the various aircraft, ships, submarines, automobiles, and other miscellaneous remnants of Hawaii’s past that the submersibles encountered. HURL has since surveyed and researched more than 140 such sites. Nearly all of these were found during each year’s 3 preseason test and training dives. A number of these artifacts have been found to be of significant historic value, such as the Ward’s midget submarine and the mysterious “3-Piece” midget submarine that took part in the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|December 7th attack on Pearl Harbor]]. The giant seaplane “[[Martin JRM Mars|Marshall Mars]]”, the gunboat [[USS Bennington (PG-4)|USS ''Bennington'']], the cable-laying ship [[USS Kailua (IX-71)|USS ''Kailua'']], the Japanese fleet submarines [[I-400-class submarine|I-400]], [[Japanese submarine I-401|I-401]], [[I-124 Japanese submarine|I-124]], and [[I-201-class submarine|I-201]], and several turn-of-the-century Inter-island steamships have also been located and surveyed. Other artifacts discovered include over 25 WWII era landing craft ranging in size from 30’ LVT's to 330’ LST's, various aircraft as early as four 1931 Keystone PK-1 Seaplanes to WWII and [[Korean War]] era military planes to light engine civilian aircraft that went down in the 1980's and 90's.&lt;ref&gt;Hawaii Undersea Research Lab Archives. Maritime Heritage Database. Aircraft&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hawaii Undersea Research Lab Archives. Maritime Heritage Database. Ships&lt;/ref&gt; More than 60 automobiles have been found that were built from 1917 to the mid-1940's Including military trucks, construction equipment, hand cranked touring cars, and sedans. These vehicles are spread out over a 7 mile span off South Oahu.&lt;ref&gt;Hawaii Undersea Research Lab Archives. Maritime Heritage Database. Vehicles&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 3, 2009 HURL began a series of dives off South Oahu under contract with the [[United States Army|US Army]] to conduct an assessment of the chemical weapons disposed at sea after WWII.  The [[Hawaii Undersea Military Munitions Assessment]] (HUMMA) project consisted of 16 dives in 2009 and 14 dives in 2012. Although HURL has observed thousands of pieces of ordnance of numerous types over the past decades, the primary weapon of interest for this project was the M41A2 100-pound mustard gas bombs of which it is estimated that 16,000 were disposed of off Oahu. More than 100 of this particular type of bomb have been observed and several were selected for survey. Samples were collected from the sediment, water, and marine life in the immediate vicinity of these bombs. Other conventional weapons, and areas void of ordnance, were also surveyed for comparison.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Salvage &amp; Special Projects'' ===
In addition to its traditional science dive program, HURL has also conducted a number of dives to locate and recover lost vehicles or instruments. This started with the recovery of the ''SeaMarc II'' lost off South Oahu in January 1989.  As of 2015, HURL had recovered eleven items from the deep sea with a 100% success rate. The submersibles have also been chartered by several non-academic organizations for various projects that range from pipeline inspections, sewer outfall surveys, cable route surveys, and numerous television documentaries. In 2011 and again in 2013, the ''Pisces V'' made dives in conjunction with technical divers. The submersible would pinpoint particular sites of interest and deploy a buoy with down line for the divers. This allowed the divers, who had a very limited bottom time, to make the most efficient use of their time on location and conduct operations that required more precise dexterity than the submersible manipulator arms can perform.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18253">'''Hyperkino''' is a standardized system of referencing and [[Annotation|annotating]] films on digital carriers - attaching related content and analysis to individual frames. The name of the method, Hyperkino, is based on the intertwining of the concepts of [[textual criticism]] and [[hypertext]].

== From Theory to Practice ==
Hyperkino was developed by [[Natascha Drubek]] and Nikolai Izvolov between 2005 and 2008:&lt;ref&gt;On the relation of textus and apparatus cf. Michal Kosák, K podobě komentáře: nad filmovou sérií Hyperkino. Slovo a smysl, 10, 2013, č. 20, p. 314-317. http://slovoasmysl.ff.cuni.cz/node/499&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We have connected the traditional principles of annotation with digital technologies and their markup languages, applying hypermedia principles of commentary to the linear medium of film. HYPERKINO annotations of a film are comparable to the [[footnotes]] and the commentary in historical-critical editions of texts, with the only difference being that they are {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} various media forms (text, sound, pictures). […] The tradition of scholarly editions provides sophisticated ways of preserving texts over centuries, keeping them alive in constantly evolving receptions and commentaries. The idea of indexing a text, turning it into a network of interrelations and linking it with other texts, goes back to the tradition of editing scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperkino.net/hyperkino/What-is-HYPERKINO|title=What is HYPERKINO / hyperkino / convergence - Website Interface|last=Systems|first=eZ|website=hyperkino.net|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Digital humanities scholar Christian Gosvig Olesen stresses the importance of the analytical and theoretical phase preceding practical steps towards developing and designing the Hyperkino method: “In 2006 Drubek and Izvolov penned an article together that formulated this vision, Critical Editions of Films on Digital Formats, which was published in the eighth edition of the international film studies review Cinema &amp; Cie.&lt;ref&gt;“Critical Editions of Films on Digital Formats”, Cinema &amp; Cie (autumn 2006). A second English edition appeared in Studies in Russian and Soviet Cinema, Volume 2, 2008, Issue 2, 205-216. The method was first described in the 2005 Russian original of the article: Natascha Drubek-Meyer/ Nikolaj Izvolov: “Kommentirovannoe izdanie fil’mov na DVD: neobchodimost’ naučnych standartov”. In: Kinovedcheskie zapiski 72, 2005, p. 372-383.&lt;/ref&gt; in the fall of 2006.”

He characterizes Hyperkino as a philological reaction to audio commentaries which were the early and most popular forms of extras on DVDs: &lt;blockquote&gt;The article departed from a critique of current presentations in academic and contextualizing analyses of films on DVD to conceptualize a new way of DVD editorship relying on annotations and a more extensive and effective use of the hyperlinked structure of the DVD format. One of the points of critique was that existing DVD editions much too often overburdened the works in question […] Drubek and Izvolov instead advocated for a use of annotations which could appear in conjunction with the film but also exist independently of it. As the basis of this proposition they proposed a distinction between the film in itself as textus, which should be able to stand alone and be viewed independently of an analytical interpretive layer, and on the other hand an apparatus including all that which is not part of the filmic text itself: notes on the film’s historical context, script, stills or for example correspondences or business documents related to the film’s production.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://filmhistoryinthemaking.com/2013/08/10/what-is-hyperkino-ruscicos-academia-dvd-series-and-the-historical-critical-film-edition/|title=What Is Hyperkino?

In the ten years of its existence this format had produced several noteworthy audio commentaries by either filmmakers or scholars.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peterbosma.info/?p=blog&amp;blog=30|title=Hyperkino. Een dvd met voetnoten (2010)|last=Bosma|first=Peter|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it hardly had contributed to creating a standard of critical editions of films on digital carriers. In the academic environment of film studies the digital representation of film seemed to usher in a welcome convergence of film and writing on film. Digital technologies offered an option to explore the old medium of film from a new angle. The idea of a scholarly digital edition of a film surfaced several years after the first “Deluxe” editions of films with “deleted scenes” and other DVD extras were published. Scholarly interest in the DVD was driven by the requirement to have a stable “textus” which could be the basis of citations. In addition, film analysis asked for tools to annotate shots or even single frames in a film without destroying the cinematic text itself by intrusive modifications such as inserting talking heads or acousmatic voices of commentators.
From this perspective Hyperkino was an exercise in understatement compared to other DVD extras. Its principle was a hidden annotation linked to the film frame marked by a minimal sign, usually a number.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Clicking the number leads the viewer onto an off-screen commentary text section. “These sections we call 'footnotes' for the film. The main difference to current DVD commentaries is the presentation of scholarly research: It happens not in an audio but in a written format which makes the commentary quotable. Every HYPERKINO DVD edition is tantamount to an introductory article about the film published. The film and texts about the film merge on the digital carrier.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/result/rcn/48480_en.html|title=European Commission : CORDIS : Projects &amp; Results Service : Final Activity Report Summary - HYFIP (Hypertextual Film Presentation.

== Hyperkino DVDs ==
As a commercially available DVD format Hyperkino materialized itself three years after the programmatic article by Drubek and Izvolov. In 2008 Drubek produced a Hyperkino DVD in Berlin and Prague, publishing Nikolai Izvolov’s reconstruction of [[Lev Kuleshov]]’s until then unpublished first film: ''Proekt inzhenera Praita''.

Gosvig Olesen writes: “First in the fold of the German DVD publisher Absolutmedien and later as the series KinoAcademia published by RUSCICO. The film to launch the format was Lev Kuleshov’s debut feature Proekt inzhenera Prayta (Engineer Prite’s Project), USSR, 1918). Not only was it the first time the film was made available digitally, it had also, as pointed out by film historian Kristin Thompson, for a long time only existed in a version without intertitles, which left the impression that the film was incomplete.”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hyperkino editions emphasize the importance of incorporating different versions of the film. Two versions can be found on the German DVD of Engineer Prite’s Project allowing to compare the fragmented film as it lies in Gosfilmofond without intertitles with Izvolov’s 2001 reconstruction of the film which incorporated textual material from a surviving original libretto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cinando.com/en/Film/engineer_prites_project_59063/Detail|title=ENGINEER PRITE'S PROJECT|website=cinando.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVD contains the TV documentary The Kuleshov Effect (USSR, 1969) by Semyon Raitburt (ЭФФЕКТ КУЛЕШОВА, 1969, Семён Райтбурт). The Hyperkino “footnotes” quote from interviews with Kuleshov and [[Viktor Shklovsky]].

In the following years around a dozen of Hyperkino DVDs were released by the Russian publisher RUSCICO under the series title “Kino Academia” containing the annotations of international film scholars specializing in Russian and Soviet film:  Aleksandr Deriabin, Natascha Drubek, Bernard Eisenschitz, Jeremy Hicks, Nikolai Izvolov, Ekaterina Khokhlova, Milena Musina, Sergei Kapterev, Natalia Riabchikova, and Yuri Tsivian. Not all of the initially announced DVDs have been published yet, due to the high production costs.

In line with the aims described in Drubek’s and Izvolov’s 2005 article, every Hyperkino DVD edition consists of a textus and an apparatus. The apparatus in Hyperkino editions consists of alternative versions and “footnotes” connected to the film. Footnote numbers on all Hyperkino DVDs appear during playback in the upper right corner of the frame. In the RUSCICO editions the textus is on disc 1 (language versions) and the apparatus on disc 2 (film without language versions but with Hyperkino footnotes).

== Awards ==
In 2010 at the Bologna festival Il Cinema Ritrovato three Hyperkino titles were awarded with the  “DVD Awards 2010, VII edition. Best Special Features (Bonus) for their innovative handling of printed and illustrated commentaries”. The three DVDs were:
* THE GREAT CONSOLER (Russia/1933) by Lev Kuleshov – Ruscico (Russia) - hyperkino annotations by Ekaterina Khokhlova
* ENGINEER PRITE’S PROJECT (Russia/1918) by Lev Kuleshov – Ruscico (Russia) - hyperkino annotations by N. Drubek-Meyer / Nikolai Izvolov
* OCTOBER (Russia/1927) by Sergey Eisenstein, Grigori Aleksandrov – Ruscico (Russia) - hyperkino annotations by Yuri Tsivian
In the same year Hyperkino received another award from the Russian Guild of Film Critics and Scholars, the “Elephant 2010” (Kinovedenie i kinokritika v elektronnych SMI, novye technologii).

== Reviews and Reactions ==
“The idea of Hyperkino is a sensational breakthrough: imagine what a potential is looming here!”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In his article "The Mosaic Approach. In defense of a nonlinear film criticism" Jonathan Rosenbaum describes Hyperkino as "a hybrid form—existing somewhere between reading and watching, like various computer-related activities—is part of what seems forward-looking about them […] What all these forms of criticism suggest is not merely a less linear way of approaching film experience but also a more interactive methodology. The fact that movies are being seen more and more often away from public theaters shouldn't necessarily mean that the way we all experience them and share our experiences is any less social. Perhaps it's more pertinent to note that the very forms of our social interactions in relation to films are changing as well."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.movingimagesource.us/articles/the-mosaic-approach-20100818|title=The Mosaic Approach by  Jonathan Rosenbaum - Moving Image Source|website=www.movingimagesource.us|access-date=2016-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julian Graffy discusses Hyperkino from the perspective of the “commentarist”: “Engaging with the Hyperkino commentaries leads to thoughts about the fundamental differences between a spoken commentary, the only version most viewers will so far have encountered, and the (predominantly written) Hyperkino approach.” Graffy mentions the time factor which challenged the performance of audio commentators: “bottlenecks, where too much is happening at once for you to cover all you want to say; and longueurs, where you wonder how to fill the space, or worry about extended periods of silence. […] None of these problems exists, of course, for the Hyperkino commentarist – he or she is not time-bound, and the notes can be as short or as long as required. They can also be more scholarly – the notes on Strike especially are full of references to sources both printed and archival – indicating to the scholar/student viewer where to do further research. And, above all, they have the advantage of hybridity, which is why the Hyperkino notes are more than just a book on screen.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graffy|first=Julian|year=2010|title=[Hyperkino] DVD Reviews|url=|journal=Studies in Russian and Soviet Cinema|volume=4|issue=3|pages=345–354|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 film critic and media scholar Joachim Schätz called the Hyperkino publication of the Kuleshov debut a "mediated revolution" (“vermittelte Revolution”)  and Hyperkino "one of the most exciting forms of reflection on film one can experience today."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3995">'''Information Processes and Technology''' ('''IPT''')  is the study of [[information system]]s and the processes and technology involved in them. IPT is also a subject offered to senior [[high school]] students in [[Australia]] in university entrance exams such as the [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|HSC]] in New South Wales. It focuses on giving the student an understanding of [[information technology]], information processes and the skills to create [[information systems]] and some basic [[Computer programming|programming]] skills. Some of the social and ethical issues of computer systems may also be included in the course of the subject. 

== New South Wales ==
In [[New South Wales]], IPT is separated into the Preliminary (Year 11) and HSC (Year 12) courses. A prerequisite for the HSC Course is successful completion of the Preliminary Course. In June 2009 the course for 2010 and beyond was detailed in the NSW [[Board of Studies]]' HSC Information Processes and Technology Syllabus.&lt;ref name="HSCIPT"&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/syllabus_hsc/pdf_doc/ipt-st6-syl-from2010.pdf | title = Information Processes and Technology Stage 6 Syllabus | publisher = [[Board of Studies]] | format = [[PDF]] | date = June 2009 | accessdate = 26 February 2013 | isbn = 978-1-74147-719-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; IPT is one of the HSC courses which may be accelerated – students in some schools have the option of completing it in Year 10.

Topics studied in the Preliminary Course are:
* [[Introduction to Information Skills and Systems]]
* [[Tools for Information Processes]], (which includes Seven Information Processes: Collecting, Organising, Analysing, Storing and Retrieving, Transmitting and Receiving, Processing and Displaying).
* Developing Information Systems

In the HSC IPT core topics studied are:
* [[Project Management]]
* [[Information Systems]] and [[Databases]]
* [[Telecommunication|Communication]]s

The [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|HSC]] (Year 12) component of IPT also involves a number of option topics, usually of which two are chosen (usually by the school or teacher). These include:
* [[Transaction Processing Systems]]
* [[Multimedia Systems]]
* [[Automated Manufacturing Systems]]
* [[Decision Support Systems]]

Other computing based courses offered in the HSC include Software Design &amp; Development and Computing Applications.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boardofstudies.nsw.edu.au/syllabus_hsc/course-descriptions/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Queensland ==
In [[Queensland]], the Information Processing and Technology course is defined in the Queensland Studies Authority [http://www.qsa.qld.edu.au/yrs11_12/subjects/ipt/syllabus.pdf  Senior Certificate Information Processing and Technology] document. The Senior IPT subject has four core topics, which are:
* Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS) worth 30% of the assessment
* Software and System Engineering (SSE) worth 30% of the assessment
* Social and Ethical Issues (SEI) worth 10% of the assessment
* Human Computer Interaction (HCI) worth 10% of the assessment

The SEI and HCI topics, although each allocated 10% of course time, are not treated as separate topics but are instead integrated into the other two topics, IIS and SSE. The remaining 20% of the assessment comes from extension coursework, which comes from the core subjects Information and Intelligent Systems and or Software and System Engineering and is supposed to broaden the scope of learning or the depth of learning in the subject.

'''Internet linguistics''' is a domain of [[linguistics]] advocated by the English linguist [[David Crystal]]. It studies new language styles and forms that have arisen under the influence of the [[Internet]] and of other [[new media]], such as [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) [[text messaging]].&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the beginning of [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI) leading to [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) and Internet-mediated communication (IMC), experts{{who?|date=May 2018}} have acknowledged that linguistics has a contributing role in it, in terms of web interface and usability. Studying the emerging language on the Internet can help improve conceptual organization, translation and web usability. Such study aims to benefit both linguists and web users.&lt;ref name=" Linguistics and web usability "&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of Internet linguistics can take place through four main perspectives: [[#socp|sociolinguistics]], [[#ep|education]], [[#sp|stylistics]] and [[#ap|applied]] linguistics.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope"/&gt; Further dimensions have developed as a result of further technological advances - which include the development of the Web as [[text corpus | corpus]] and the spread and influence of the stylistic variations brought forth by the spread of the Internet, through the [[mass media]] and through [[literary works]]. In view of the increasing number of users connected to the Internet, the linguistics future of the Internet remains to be determined, as new computer-mediated technologies continue to emerge and people adapt their languages to suit these new media.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt; The Internet continues to play a significant role both in encouraging as well as in diverting attention away from the usage of languages.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Minority Languages, Multimedia and the Web"/&gt;

==Main perspectives==

David Crystal has identified four main perspectives for further investigation – the sociolinguistic perspective, the educational perspective, the stylistic perspective and the applied perspective.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The four perspectives are effectively interlinked and affect one another.

=== {{anchor|socp}}Sociolinguistic perspective ===
This perspective deals with how society views the impact of Internet development on languages.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; The advent of the Internet has revolutionized communication in many ways; it changed the way people communicate and created new platforms with far-reaching social impact. Significant avenues include but are not limited to SMS text messaging, [[e-mails]], [[Online chat|chatgroups]], [[virtual worlds]] and the Web.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt;

The evolution of these new mediums of communications has raised much concern with regards to the way language is being used. According to Crystal (2005), these concerns are neither without grounds nor unseen in history – it surfaces almost always when a new technology breakthrough influences languages; as seen in the 15th century when [[printing]] was introduced, the 19th century when the [[telephone]] was invented and the 20th century when [[broadcasting]] began to penetrate our society.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt;

At a personal level, CMC such as SMS Text Messaging and mobile e-mailing ([[push mail]]) has greatly enhanced instantaneous communication.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; Some examples include the [[iPhone]] and the [[BlackBerry]].

In schools, it is not uncommon for educators and students to be given personalized school e-mail accounts for communication and interaction purposes.  Classroom discussions are increasingly being brought onto the Internet in the form of discussion forums. For instance, at [[Nanyang Technological University]], students engage in collaborative learning at the university’s portal – edveNTUre, where they participate in discussions on forums and online quizzes and view streaming podcasts prepared by their course instructors among others. [[iTunes U]] in 2008 began to collaborate with universities as they converted the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] music service into a store that makes available academic lectures and scholastic materials for free – they have partnered more than 600 institutions in 18 countries including [[Oxford University|Oxford]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] Universities.&lt;ref name="iPhone takes on BlackBerry"&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;

These forms of academic social networking and media are slated to rise as educators from all over the world continue to seek new ways to better engage students. It is commonplace for students in [[New York University]] to interact with “guest speakers weighing in via [[Skype]], library staffs providing support via [[instant messaging]], and students accessing library resources from off campus.”&lt;ref name="Universities Use Social Media to Connect"&gt;{{Cite news

| accessdate = 2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will affect the way language is used as students and teachers begin to use more of these CMC platforms.&lt;ref name="Universities Use Social Media to Connect"/&gt;

At a professional level, it is a common sight for companies to have their computers and laptops hooked up onto the Internet (via wired and wireless [[Internet connection]]), and for employees to have individual e-mail accounts. This greatly facilitates internal (among staffs of the company) and external (with other parties outside of one’s organization) communication. Mobile communications such as [[smart phones]] are increasingly making their way into the corporate world. For instance, in 2008, Apple announced their intention to actively step up their efforts to help companies incorporate the iPhone into their enterprise environment, facilitated by technological developments in streamlining integrated features (push e-mail, calendar and contact management) using [[ActiveSync]].&lt;ref name="iPhone takes on BlackBerry" /&gt;

In general, these new CMCs that are made possible by the Internet have altered the way people use language – there is heightened informality and consequently a growing fear of its deterioration. However, as David Crystal puts it, these should be seen positively as it reflects the power of the creativity of a language.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt;

====Themes====

The sociolinguistics of the Internet may also be examined through five interconnected themes.&lt;ref name="Thurlow"&gt;{{cite book

# [[Multilingualism]] – It looks at the prevalence and status of various languages on the Internet.
# [[Language change]] – From a sociolinguistic perspective, language change is influenced by the physical constraints of technology (e.g. typed text) and the shifting social-economic priorities such as globalization. It explores the linguistic changes over time, with emphasis on [[Internet lingo]].
# [[Conversation analysis|Conversation discourse]] – It explores the changes in patterns of social interaction and communicative practice on the Internet.
# Stylistic diffusion – It involves the study of the spread of Internet jargons and related linguistic forms into common usage. As language changes, conversation discourse and stylistic diffusion overlap with the aspect of language stylistics.
#:''See below: [[#sp|Stylistic perspective]]''
# [[Metalanguage]] and [[folk linguistics]] – It involves looking at the way these linguistic forms and changes on the Internet are labelled and discussed (e.g. impact of Internet lingo resulted in the 'death' of the apostrophe and loss of capitalization.)

==={{anchor|ep}}Educational perspective===
The educational perspective of internet linguistics examines the Internet's impact on [[formal language]] use, specifically on [[Standard English]], which in turn affects [[language education]].&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The rise and rapid spread of Internet use has brought about new linguistic features specific only to the Internet platform. These include, but are not limited to, an increase in the use of informal written language, inconsistency in written styles and [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]] and the use of new abbreviations in Internet chats and SMS text messaging, where constraints of technology on word count contributed to the rise of new abbreviations.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; Such [[acronyms]] exist primarily for practical reasons — to reduce the time and effort required to communicate through these mediums apart from technological limitations. Examples of common acronyms include ''[[lol]]'' (for laughing out loud; a general expression of laughter), ''[[SMS language#Common abbreviations|omg]]'' (oh my god) and ''gtg'' (got to go).&lt;ref name="The Influence of Internet on Language and Email Stress"&gt;{{cite journal

The educational perspective has been considerably established in the research on the Internet's impact on language education. It is an important and crucial aspect as it affects and involves the education of current and future student generations in the appropriate and timely use of informal language that arises from [[Internet usage]]. There are concerns for the growing infiltration of informal language use and incorrect word use into academic or formal situations, such as the usage of casual words like "guy" or the choice of the word "preclude" in place of "precede" in academic papers by students. There are also issues with spellings and grammar occurring at a higher frequency among students' academic works as noted by educators, with the use of abbreviations such as "u" for "you" and "2" for "to" being the most common.&lt;ref name="No LOL Matter: Cyber lingo shows up in academia"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists and professors like Eleanor Johnson suspect that widespread mistakes in writing are strongly connected to Internet usage, where educators have similarly reported new kinds of spelling and grammar mistakes in student works. There is, however, no [[scientific evidence]] to confirm the proposed connection.&lt;ref name="Experts divided over Internet changes to Language"&gt;{{cite news

| publisher = [[Voanews.com|VOANews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are valid concerns about Internet usage and its impact on students' academic and formal writing, its severity is however enlarged by the informal nature of the new media platforms. [[Naomi Baron|Naomi S. Baron]] (2008)  argues in ''Always On'' that student writings suffer little impact from the use of Internet-mediated communication (IMC) such as internet chat, SMS text messaging and e-mail.&lt;ref name="Always On"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2009 published by the [[British Psychological Society|British Journal of Developmental Psychology]] found that students who regularly texted (sent messages via SMS using a mobile phone) displayed a wider range of vocabulary and this may lead to a positive impact on their reading development.&lt;ref name="Texting improves language skill"&gt;{{cite news

Though the use of the Internet resulted in stylistics that are not deemed appropriate in academic and formal language use, it is to be noted that Internet use may not hinder language education but instead aid it. The Internet has proven in different ways that it can provide potential benefits in enhancing language learning, especially in second or [[Foreign language teaching|foreign language learning]]. Language education through the Internet in relation to Internet linguisitics is, most significantly, applied through the communication aspect (use of e-mails, [[discussion forums]], [[Instant messaging|chat messengers]], [[blog]]s, etc.).&lt;ref name="Globalization and Language Education"&gt;{{cite web

IMC allows for greater interaction between language learners and native speakers of the language, providing for greater error corrections and better learning opportunities of standard language, in the process allowing the picking up of specific skills such as negotiation and persuasion.&lt;ref name="Globalization and Language Education"/&gt;

==={{anchor|sp}}Stylistic perspective===
This perspective examines how the Internet and its related technologies have encouraged new and different forms of creativity in language, especially in literature.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; It looks at the Internet as a medium through which new language phenomena have arisen. This new mode of language is interesting to study because it is an amalgam of both spoken and written languages. For example, traditional writing is static compared to the dynamic nature of the new language on the Internet where words can appear in different colors and font sizes on the computer screen.&lt;ref name=" Linguists See Internet Lingo as Cultural Catalyst "&gt;{{Cite news

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, this new mode of language also contains other elements not found in natural languages. One example is the concept of framing found in e-mails and discussion forums. In replying to e-mails, people generally use the sender’s e-mail message as a frame to write their own messages. They can choose to respond to certain parts of an e-mail message while leaving other bits out. In discussion forums, one can start a new thread and anyone regardless of their physical location can respond to the idea or thought that was set down through the Internet. This is something that is usually not found in written language.&lt;ref name=" Linguists See Internet Lingo as Cultural Catalyst"/&gt;

Future research also includes new varieties of expressions that the Internet and its various technologies are constantly producing and their effects not only on written languages but also their spoken forms.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The communicative style of Internet language is best observed in the CMC channels below, as there are often attempts to overcome technological restraints such as transmission time lags and to re-establish social cues that are often vague in written text.&lt;ref name="Thurlow"/&gt;

====Mobile phones====
{{see also|mobile phone}}
Mobile phones (also called "cell phones") have an expressive potential beyond their basic communicative functions. This can be seen in text-messaging poetry competitions such as the one held by [[The Guardian]].&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The 160-character limit imposed by the cell phone has motivated users to exercise their linguistic creativity to overcome them.  A similar example of new technology with character constraints is [[Twitter]], which has a 280-character limit.  There have been debates as to whether these new abbreviated forms introduced in users’ [[wikt:Special:Search/tweet|Tweet]]s are "lazy" or whether they are creative fragments of communication. Despite the ongoing debate, there is no doubt that Twitter has contributed to the linguistic landscape with new lingoes and also brought about a new dimension of communication.&lt;ref name=" From Telegraph to Twitter: The Language of the Short Form "&gt;{{Cite news

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cell phone has also created a new literary genre – [[cell phone novels]]. A typical cell phone novel consists of several chapters which readers download in short installments. These novels are in their "raw" form as they do not go through editing processes like traditional novels. They are written in short sentences, similar to text-messaging.&lt;ref name="Thumbs Race as Japan’s Best Sellers Go Cellular"&gt;{{Cite news

| accessdate = 2010-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Authors of such novels are also able to receive feedbacks and new ideas from their readers through e-mails or online feedback channels. Unlike traditional novel writing, readers’ ideas sometimes get incorporated into the storyline or authors may also decide to change their story’s plot according to the demand and popularity of their novel (typically gauged by the number of download hits).&lt;ref name="Cell Phones Put to Novel Use"&gt;{{cite news

====Virtual worlds====
{{see also|virtual worlds}}

Virtual worlds provide insights into how users are adapting the usage of natural language for communication within these new mediums. The Internet language that has arisen through user interactions in text-based chatrooms and [[computer-simulated]] worlds has led to the development of slangs within digital communities. Examples of these include [[pwn]] and [[noob]]. [[Emoticons]] are further examples of how users have adapted different expressions to suit the limitations of cyberspace communication, one of which is the "loss of emotivity".&lt;ref name="On The Linguistic Nature of Cyberspace and Virtual Communities"&gt;{{cite journal

Communication in niches such as [[role-playing game]]s (RPG) of [[MUDs|Multi-User domains]] (MUDs) and virtual worlds is highly interactive, with emphasis on speed, brevity and spontaneity.  As a result, CMC is generally more vibrant, volatile, unstructured and open. There are often complex organization of sequences and exchange structures evident in the connection of conversational strands and short turns. Some of the CMC strategies used include capitalization for words such as ''EMPHASIS'', usage of symbols such as the asterisk to enclose words as seen in ''*stress*'' and the creative use of punctuation like ''???!?!?!?''.&lt;ref name="Thurlow"/&gt; Symbols are also used for discourse functions, such as the asterisk as a [[Conversation analysis#Repair|conversational repair]] marker and arrows and carats as [[deixis]] and [[referent]] markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collister|first=Lauren B.|date=2012-03-01|title=The discourse deictics ∧ and &lt;-- in a World of Warcraft community|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211695812000050|journal=Discourse, Context &amp; Media|volume=1|issue=1|pages=9–19|doi=10.1016/j.dcm.2012.05.002|archive-url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/17348/|archive-date=21 Feb 2013}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collister|first=Lauren Brittany|date=2011-02-01|title=*-repair in Online Discourse|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610003152|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|series=The Language of Space and Time|volume=43|issue=3|pages=918–921|doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.09.025|archive-url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/20621/|archive-date=21 Feb 2014}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides contributing to these new forms in language, virtual worlds are also being used to teach languages. [[Virtual world language learning]] provides students with simulations of real-life environments, allowing them to find creative ways to improve their language skills. Virtual worlds are good tools for language learning among the younger learners because they already see such places as a "natural place to learn and play".&lt;ref name=" Language Teaching Gains Second Life: Virtual Worlds Offer New Methods to Teach Languages "&gt;{{Cite press release

====E-mail====
{{See also|email}}

One of the most popular Internet-related technologies to be studied under this perspective is e-mail, which has expanded the stylistics of languages in many ways. A study done on the linguistic profile of e-mails has shown that there is a hybrid of speech and writing styles in terms of format, grammar and style.&lt;ref name="baron"&gt;{{cite journal

| accessdate = 2010-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often related to informality as it feels temporary and can be deleted easily. However, as this medium of communication matures, e-mail is no longer confined to sending informal messages between friends and relatives. Instead, business correspondences are increasingly being carried out through e-mails. Job seekers are also using e-mails to send their resumes to potential employers. The result of a move towards more formal usages will be a medium representing a range of formal and informal stylistics.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"/&gt;

While e-mail has been blamed for students’ increased usage of informal language in their written work, David Crystal argues that e-mail is "not a threat, for language education" because e-mail with its array of stylistic expressiveness can act as a domain for language learners to make their own linguistic choices responsibly. Furthermore, the younger generation’s high propensity for using e-mail may improve their writing and communication skills because of the efforts they are making to formulate their thoughts and ideas, albeit through a digital medium.&lt;ref name=" Say so long to traditional letter writing "/&gt;

====Instant messaging====
{{See also|instant messaging}}

Like other forms of online communication, instant messaging has also developed its own acronyms and short forms. However, instant messaging is quite different from e-mail and chatgroups because it allows participants to interact with one another in real-time while conversing in private.&lt;ref name="7 things you should know about…Instant Messaging "&gt;{{Cite journal

This increased degree of intimacy allows greater informality in language and "typographical idiosyncrasies". There are also greater occurrences of stylistic variation because there can be a very wide age gap between participants. For example, a granddaughter can catch up with her grandmother through instant messaging. Unlike chatgroups where participants come together with shared interests, there is no pressure to conform in language here.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"/&gt;

==={{anchor|ap}}Applied perspective===
[[File:Language on internet.JPG|thumb|alt=|Source: [http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm Internet World Stats]]]
The applied perspective views the linguistic exploitation of the Internet in terms of its communicative capabilities – the good and the bad.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; The Internet provides a platform where users can experience multilingualism. Although English is still the dominant language used on the Internet, other languages are gradually increasing in their number of users.&lt;ref name="Thurlow" /&gt; The [[Global Internet usage]] page provides some information on the number of users of the Internet by language, nationality and geography. This multilingual environment continues to increase in diversity as more language communities become connected to the Internet. The Internet is thus a platform where minority and [[endangered language]]s can seek to revive their language use and/or create awareness. This can be seen in two instances where it provides these languages opportunities for progress in two important regards - [[language documentation]] and [[language revitalization]].&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt;

====Language documentation====
{{See also|Language documentation}}
Firstly, the Internet facilitates language documentation. Digital archives of media such as audio and video recordings not only help to preserve language documentation, but also allows for global dissemination through the Internet.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publicity about endangered languages, such as Webster (2003) has helped to spur a worldwide interest in linguistic documentation.

Foundations such as the Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Project (HRELP), funded by Arcadia also help to develop the interest in linguistic documentation. The HRELP is a project that seeks to document endangered languages, preserve and disseminate documentation materials among others. The materials gathered are made available online under its Endangered Languages Archive (ELAR) program.

Other online materials that support language documentation include the Language Archive Newsletter which provides news and articles about topics in endangered languages. The web version of Ethnologue also provides brief information of all of the world’s known living languages. By making resources and information of endangered languages and language documentation available on the Internet, it allows researchers to build on these materials and hence preserve endangered languages.

====Language revitalization====
{{See also|language revitalization}}

Secondly, the Internet facilitates language revitalization. Throughout the years, the digital environment has developed in various sophisticated ways that allow for virtual contact. From e-mails, chats to instant messaging, these virtual environments have helped to bridge the spatial distance between communicators. The use of e-mails has been adopted in language courses to encourage students to communicate in various styles such as conference-type formats and also to generate discussions.&lt;ref name="Singhal"&gt;{{cite journal

| last = Singhal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the use of e-mails facilitates language revitalization in the sense that speakers of a minority language who moved to a location where their native language is not being spoken can take advantage of the Internet to communicate with their family and friends, thus maintaining the use of their native language. With the development and increasing use of telephone broadband communication such as [[Skype]], language revitalization through the internet is no longer restricted to literate users.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt;

It is installed throughout the immersion school system and includes components for e-mails, chat, dictionary and online newspaper among others. In higher institutions such as colleges and universities where the Leoki system is not yet installed, the educators make use of other software and Internet tools such as Daedalus Interchange, e-mails and the Web to connect students of Hawaiian language with the broader community.&lt;ref name="Warschauer2"&gt;{{cite book

Another use of the Internet includes having students of minority languages write about their native cultures in their native languages for distant audiences. Also, in an attempt to preserve their language and culture, [[Occitan]] speakers have been taking advantage of the Internet to reach out to other Occitan speakers from around the world.  These methods provide reasons for using the minority languages by communicating in it.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{cite journal

====Exploitation of the Internet====
::''See also: [[Forensic linguistics]]''

The Internet can also be exploited for activities such as [[terrorism]], [[internet fraud]] and [[pedophilia]]. In recent years, there has been an increase in crimes that involved the use of the Internet such as e-mails and [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), as it is relatively easy to remain anonymous.&lt;ref name="BAAS"&gt;{{cite news

From a forensic linguistic point of view, there are many potential areas to explore. While developing a chat room [[Content-control software|child protection procedure]] based on search terms filtering is effective, there is still minimal linguistically orientated literature to facilitate the task.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; In other areas, it is observed that the [[Semantic Web]] has been involved in tasks such as personal [[data protection]], which helps to prevent fraud.&lt;ref name="Ryan Lee"&gt;{{cite book

==Dimensions==

The dimensions covered in this section include looking at the Web as a corpus and issues of language identification and normalization. The impacts of internet linguistics on everyday life are examined under the spread and influence of Internet stylistics, trends of language change on the Internet and conversation discourse.

===The Web as a corpus===

With the Web being a huge reservoir of data and resources, language scientists and technologists are increasingly turning to the web for language data.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"&gt;{{Cite journal

It was met with much controversy as they lacked theoretical integrity leading to much skepticism of their role in the field,&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt; until the publication of the journal ‘Using Large Corpora’ in 1993&lt;ref name="computational linguistics using large corpora"&gt;{{Cite journal

====Themes====

There has been much discussion about the possible developments in the arena of the Web as a corpus. The development of using the web as a data source for word sense disambiguation was brought forward in The EU MEANING project in 2002.&lt;ref name="rigau000"&gt;{{Cite conference

In areas of [[language modeling]], the Web has been used to address data sparseness. Lexical statistics have been gathered for resolving prepositional phrase attachments,&lt;ref name="volk000"&gt;{{Cite conference

In areas of information retrieval, a Web track was integrated as a component in the community’s TREC evaluation initiative. The sample of the Web used for this exercise amount to around 100GB, compromising of largely documents in the .gov top level domain.&lt;ref name="hawking000"&gt;{{Cite conference

====British National Corpus====
{{See also|British National Corpus}}

The [[British National Corpus]] contains ample information on the dominant meanings and usage patterns for the 10,000 words that forms the core of English.

The number of words in the British National Corpus (ca 100 million) is sufficient for many empirical strategies for learning about language for linguists and lexicographers,&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baker001"&gt;{{Cite conference

However, for some other purposes, it is insufficient, as an outcome of the [[Zipfian distribution|Zipfian]] nature of word frequencies. Because the bulk of the lexical stock occurs less than 50 times in the British National Corpus, it is insufficient for statistically stable conclusions about such words. Furthermore, for some rarer words, rare meanings of common words, and combinations of words, no data has been found. Researchers find that probabilistic models of language based on very large quantities of data are better than ones based on estimates from smaller, cleaner data sets.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

====The multilingual Web====

{{Update||date=March 2017|inaccurate=yes|talk=The data about percentage of  languages on internet pages is from year 2000 and is no longer accurate.}}

The Web is clearly a multilingual corpus.&lt;ref&gt;Ivković, D. (2013). The Eurovision Song Contest on YouTube: A corpus-based analysis of language attitudes. Language@Internet, 10, article 1. (urn:nbn:de:0009-7-35977)&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 71% of the pages (453 million out of 634 million Web pages indexed by the Excite engine) were written in English, followed by Japanese (6.8%), German (5.1%), French (1.8%), Chinese (1.5%), Spanish (1.1%), Italian (0.9%), and Swedish (0.7%).&lt;ref name="xu000"&gt;{{Cite conference

  | year = 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A test to find contiguous words like ‘deep breath’ revealed 868,631 Web pages containing the terms in [[AlltheWeb]]. The number found through the search engines are more than three times the counts generated by the British National Corpus, indicating the significant size of the English corpus available on the Web.

The massive size of text available on the Web can be seen in the analysis of controlled data in which corpora of different languages were mixed in various proportions. The estimated Web size in words by [[AltaVista]] saw English at the top of the list with 76,598,718,000 words. The next is German, with 7,035,850,000 words along with 6 other languages with over a billion hits. Even languages with fewer hits on the Web such as Slovenian, Croatian, Malay, and Turkish have more than one hundred million words on the Web.&lt;ref name="grenstette000"&gt;{{Cite conference

====Challenges====

In areas of language modeling, there are limitations on the applicability of any language model as the statistics for different types of text will be different.&lt;ref name="biber000"&gt;{{Cite journal
 | title = Using register-diversified corpora for general language studies
 | journal = Computational Linguistics
 | volume = 19
 | issue = 2
 | pages = 219–242
 | last = Biber
 | first = Douglas
 | year = 1993
 | publisher = [[MIT Press]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a language technology application is put into use (applied to a new text type), it is not certain that the language model will fare in the same way as how it would when applied to the training corpus. It is found that there are substantial variations in model performance when the training corpus changes.&lt;ref name="sekine000"&gt;{{Cite conference
  | last = Sekine
  | first = Satshi
  | title = The domain dependence of parsing
  | booktitle = Proceedings of the Fifth Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing
  | place = Washington, DC
  | pages = 96–102
  | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of theory types limits the assessment of the usefulness of language-modeling work.

As Web texts are easily produced (in terms of cost and time) and with many different authors working on them, it often results in little concern for accuracy. Grammatical and typographical errors are regarded as “erroneous” forms that cause the Web to be a dirty corpus. Nonetheless, it may still be useful even with some noise.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

The issue of whether [[sublanguage]]s should be included remains unsettled. Proponents of it argue that with all sublanguages removed, it will result in an impoverished view of language. Since language is made up of lexicons, grammar and a wide array of different sublanguages, they should be included. However, it is not until recently that it became a viable option. Striking a middle ground by including some sublanguages is contentious because it’s an arbitrary issue of which to include and which not.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

The decision of what to include in a corpus lies with corpus developers, and it has been done so with pragmatism.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt; The desiderata and criteria used for the British National Corpus serves as a good model for a general-purpose, general-language corpus&lt;ref name="atkins001"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the focus of being representative replaced with being balanced.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

Search engines such as [[Google]] serves as a default means of access to the Web and its wide array of linguistics resources. However, for linguists working in the field of corpora, there presents a number of challenges. This includes the limited instances that are presented by the search engines (1,000 or 5,000 maximum); insufficient context for each instance (Google provides a fragment of around ten words); results selected according to criteria that are distorted (from a linguistic point of view) as search term in titles and headings often occupy the top results slots; inability to allow searches to be specified according to linguistic criteria, such as the citation form for a word, or word class; unreliability of statistics, with results varying according to search engine load and many other factors. At present, in view of the conflicts of priorities among the different stakeholders, the best solution is for linguists to attempt to correct these problems by themselves. This will then lead to a large number of possibilities opening in the area of harnessing the rich potential of the Web.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

====Representation====

Despite the sheer size of the Web, it may still not be representative of all the languages and domains in the world, and neither are other corpora. However, the huge quantities of text, in numerous languages and language types on a huge range of topics makes it a good starting point that opens up to a large number of possibilities in the study of corpora.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

===Impact of its spread and influence===

Stylistics arising from Internet usage has spread beyond the new media into other areas and platforms, including but not limited to, [[films]], [[music]] and [[literary works]]. The infiltration of Internet stylistics is important as mass audiences are exposed to the works, reinforcing certain Internet specific language styles which may not be acceptable in standard or more formal forms of language.

Apart from internet slang, grammatical errors and typographical errors are features of writing on the Internet and other CMC channels. As users of the Internet gets accustomed to these errors, it progressively infiltrates into everyday language use, in both written and spoken forms.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; It is also common to witness such errors in mass media works, from typographical errors in news articles to grammatical errors in advertisements and even internet slang in drama dialogues.

The more the internet is incorporated into daily life, the greater the impact it has on formal language. This is especially true in modern Language Arts classes through the use of smart phones, tablets, and social media. Students are exposed to the language of the internet more than ever, and as such, the grammatical structure and slang of the internet are bleeding into their formal writing. Full immersion into a language is always the best way to learn it. Mark Lester in his book ''&lt;u&gt;Teaching Grammar and Usage&lt;/u&gt;'' states, “The biggest single problem that basic writers have in developing successful strategies for coping with errors is simply their lack of exposure to formal written English...We would think it absurd to expect a student to master a foreign language without extensive exposure to it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Teaching Grammar and Usage|last = Lester|first = Mark|publisher = Allyn and Bacon|year = 2001|isbn = 0205306551|location = Boston|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since students are immersed in internet language, that is the form and structure they are mirroring.

==== Mass media ====

There has been instances of television advertisements using Internet slang, reinforcing the penetration of Internet stylistics in everyday language use. For example, in the [[Cingular Wireless|Cingular]] commercial in the United States, acronyms such as "BFF Jill" (which means "Best Friend Forever, Jill") were used. More businesses have adopted the use of Internet slang in their advertisements as the more people are growing up using the Internet and other CMC platforms, in an attempt to relate and connect to them better.&lt;ref name="Using Internet Slang in Spoken Conversation: LOL!"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such commercials have received relatively enthusiastic feedback from its audiences.&lt;ref name="Using Internet Slang in Spoken Conversation: LOL!"/&gt;

The use of [[Internet lingo]] has also spread into the arena of music, significantly seen in [[popular music]]. A recent example is [[Trey Songz|Trey Songz's]] lyrics for "LOL :-)", which incorporated many Internet lingo and mentions of Twitter and texting.&lt;ref name="Trey Songz LOL"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.treysongz.com/music/lol-ft-gucci-mane-soulja-boy/ | title = LOL :-) Ft. Gucci Mane &amp; Soulja Boy Tell 'Em | work = Song | first = Trey | last = Songz | authorlink = Trey Songz | publisher = Trey Songz| accessdate = 2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of Internet linguistics is also present in [[films]] made by both commercial and [[independent filmmakers]]. Though primarily screened at [[film festivals]], DVDs of independent films are often available for purchase over the internet including paid-live-streamings, making access to films more easily available for the public.&lt;ref name="LOL - The Movie"&gt;{{cite video

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very nature of commercial films being screened at public cinemas allows for the wide exposure to the mainstream mass audience, resulting in a faster and wider spread of Internet slangs. The latest commercial film is titled "LOL" (acronym for ''Laugh Out Loud'' or ''Laughing Out Loud''), starring [[Miley Cyrus]] and [[Demi Moore]].&lt;ref name="Miley Cyrus' Movie 'LOL' Picked Up By Distributor"&gt;{{cite news

The use of internet slangs is not limited to the English language but extends to other languages as well. The [[Korean language]] has incorporated the English alphabet in the formation of its slang, while others were formed from common misspellings arising from fast typing. The new [[Korean slang]] is further reinforced and brought into everyday language use by television shows such as [[soap operas]] or comedy dramas like “[[High Kick Through the Roof]]” released in 2009.&lt;ref name="Korean Language in Contemporary Society"&gt;[[Korean Language in Contemporary Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic future of the Internet==

With the emergence of greater computer/Internet mediated communication systems, coupled with the readiness with which people adapt to meet the new demands of a more technologically sophisticated world, it is expected that users will continue to remain under pressure to alter their language use to suit the new dimensions of communication.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

As the number of Internet users increase rapidly around the world, the cultural background, linguistic habits and language differences among users are brought into the Web at a much faster pace. These individual differences among Internet users are predicted to significantly impact the future of Internet linguistics, notably in the aspect of the multilingual web. As seen from 2000 to 2010, Internet penetration has experienced its greatest growth in non-English speaking countries such as China, India and Africa,&lt;ref name="Internet Usage Statistics"&gt;{{cite web

Also, the interaction between English and other languages is predicted to be an important area of study.&lt;ref&gt;Ivkovic, D., &amp; Lotherington, H. (2009). Multilingualism in cyberspace: Conceptualising the virtual linguistic landscape. International Journal of Multilingualism, 6(1), 17-36.&lt;/ref&gt; As global users interact with each other, possible references to different languages may continue to increase, resulting in formation of new Internet stylistics that spans across languages. Chinese and Korean languages have already experienced English language's infiltration leading to the formation of their multilingual Internet lingo.&lt;ref name="A Comparison of English and Chinese Internet Language"&gt;{{cite web

At current state, the Internet provides a form of education and promotion for minority languages. However, similar to how cross-language interaction has resulted in English language's infiltration into Chinese and Korean languages to form new slangs,&lt;ref name="A Comparison of English and Chinese Internet Language" /&gt; minority languages are also affected by the more common languages used on the Internet (such as English and Spanish). While language interaction can cause a loss in the authentic standard of minority languages, familiarity of the majority language can also affect the minority languages in adverse ways.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Minority Languages, Multimedia and the Web"&gt;{{cite journal

'''Joseph Yasser''' (April 16, 1893 – September 6, 1981) was a Russian-American [[organist]], [[music theorist]], [[author]], and [[Musicology|musicologist]]. An influential figure who established a handful of musical institutions, Yasser is noted for his 1932 publication, ''A Theory of Evolving Tonality''. He was active until his death at age 88 in 1981. Yasser was married but had no children.

Yasser was born in [[Łódź]], Poland (then part of the Russian Empire) on April 16, 1893. He studied piano in Moscow with renowned pianist-cum-composer [[Jacob Weinberg]] and from 1912 to 1917 enrolled at the [[Moscow Conservatory]], graduating with honors.&lt;ref name="JTSA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jtsa.edu/The_Library/Collections/Archives/Music_Archives/Yasser.xml#bn |title=The Joseph Yasser Collection: Biographical Note|publisher=[[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]]|accessdate=February 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1918 Yasser succeeded B. Sabaneev as leader of the school's organ department.&lt;ref name="Jews in China"/&gt; In 1919 he was named Chief Organist of the Imperial Opera (Bolshoi Theatre), and in 1920 and 1921 toured [[Siberia]] with a state quartet as a pianist and lecturer.&lt;ref name="JTSA"/&gt; In 1921 Yasser moved to [[Shanghai]], China, directing the "Shanghai Songsters" choral society and performing in concert, including as a member of a piano quintet which he formed.&lt;ref name="JTSA"/&gt;

In 1923 he moved to the United States, where he studied [[musical tuning]] and [[Jewish music|Jewish]], and [[Russian traditional music|Russian music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewish-music.huji.ac.il/content/joseph-yasser |title=Joseph Yasser|publisher=Jewish Music Research Center|year=2013|accessdate=February 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly interested in the Chinese organ, Yasser continued as a Chinese music lecturer in the United States.&lt;ref name="Jews in China"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Jews of China: V. 1: Historical and Comparative Perspectives|page=243|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=PcrKBgAAQBAJ|year=2015|first=Jonathan|last=Goldstein|isbn=9781317456056|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as organist and choir director at [[Congregation Rodeph Sholom (Manhattan)|Congregation Rodeph Sholom]] from 1929 to 1960.&lt;ref name="JTSA"/&gt;

Yasser was a co-founder, along with [[Charles Seeger]], of the American Library of Musicology in 1931, co-founder of the [[American Musicological Society]] in 1934, and collector and advocate of Jewish and Jewish-American music.&lt;ref name="JTSA"/&gt; In the 1960s, Yasser published ''The magrepha of the Herodian temple: A five-fold hypothesis'' in which he opined that the mysterious ''magrepha'', an integral part of ancient Jewish rituals, was "not a musical instrument in the modern sense, and much less an organ" but instead a digging tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=SuE3AQAAIAAJ|page=146|year=2006|publisher=P Lang|isbn=9783631539057|first=Joachim|last=Braun|title=On Jewish music: past and present}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he may be best known as the author of ''A Theory of Evolving Tonality'' (1932) and advocate of progressive [[equal temperament]]s; Yasser wrote music in [[19 equal temperament]].&lt;ref&gt;Myles Leigh Skinner (2007). ''Toward a Quarter-tone Syntax: Analyses of Selected Works by Blackwood, Haba, Ives, and Wyschnegradsky'', p. 51n6. {{ISBN|9780542998478}}. Cites Leedy, Douglas (1991). "A Venerable Temperament Rediscovered", ''Perspectives of New Music'' 29/2, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the use of the musical interval measurements, namely the [[decitone]], centitone, and millitone.&lt;ref&gt;Yasser, Joseph (1932). ''A Theory of Evolving Tonality'', p.14. American Library of Musicology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farnsworth, Paul Randolph (1969). ''The Social Psychology of Music'', p. 24. {{ISBN|9780813815473}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of articles from 1937 to 1938, which were later compiled into a book titled ''Medieval Quartal Harmony'', published by the American Library of Musicology, he proposed the implementation of a system "harmonizing pentatonic melodies" based upon the perfect fourth interval.&lt;ref name="JTSA"/&gt; From 1944 till its closure in 1980, Yasser frequently participated in activities organised by the New York-based National Jewish Music Council, founded to raise awareness on Jewish music.&lt;ref name="JTSA"/&gt; From 1951 to around 1960, he lectured at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America|Jewish Theological Seminary]]'s Cantors Institute, specialising in the theory and history of Jewish music. He was hailed as an "important mentor to younger students".&lt;ref name="JTSA"/&gt; Yasser was a zealous contributor to ''Novoye Russkoye Slovo'', a Russian daily, and wrote about various topics in music.&lt;ref name="JTSA"/&gt;

==Personal life==
According to protege [[Herman Berlinski]], in his final years, Joseph Yasser was a "recluse" who avoided prolonged periods outdoors due to an [[Anaphylaxis|anaphylactic]] reaction to a wasp sting which he experienced in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="JTSA"/&gt; Nonetheless, he was active as a musicologist until his death, although the frequency of activity decreased. In his old age, he was reportedly still mentally sharp. Married with no children, Yasser died on September 6, 1981, in [[New York City]] at age 88.&lt;ref name="JTSA"/&gt; His spouse Marie died two years later, in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssdmf.info/by_number/pages/031454.html Social Security Death Master File].

'''Life-cycle engineering''' (LCE) is an approach to assess the environmental impacts in conjunction with economic impacts under consideration of technical boundary conditions. Scope of the assessment is usually the whole life cycle of a product consisting of production, use phase and end of life.
The [[environmental impact]]s are assessed using environmental [[life-cycle assessment]] (LCA). The economic impacts are assessed according to the [[Whole-life cost|life cycle costing]] (LCC) approach. Technical boundary conditions are taken into account providing some limitations on the model, thus verifying the technical feasibility.

LCE aims to deliver a consistent standard of living for future generations that can be maintained indefinitely. Not only does LCE aim to reduce negative impacts on the environment but it can also be used to reduce [[Cost|economic costs]] for businesses and every day society. 

One aspect of LCE for businesses is the extension of a part of a [[Product life cycle|products life-cycle]]. The method of involving incremental innovation within production can be seen as a main way to achieve this. The combination of innovation together with technology allows for the function of products to be pushed further, allowing designers to improve the quality of how products meet expanding customer needs. 
The key themes are economic, social, environmental and technological. All these themes are interlinking and can be influenced by life cycle engineering.

The regulations define lifting equipment as "work equipment for lifting or lowering loads and includes its attachments used for anchoring, fixing or supporting it".&lt;ref name="mid suffolk"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/work-equipment-machinery/lift-equipment.htm What is lifting equipment]&lt;/ref&gt;  The regulations involve anything which involves the lifting of goods or people at work. Equipment covered would include lifts, cranes, ropes, slings, hooks, shackles, eyebolts, rope and pulley systems and forklift trucks.&lt;ref name="LHC LOLER"&gt;[http://www.lhc.org.uk/members/pubs/factsht/71fact.htm London Hazards Centre - Lifting Operations Lifiting Equipment Regulations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324061410/http://www.lhc.org.uk/members/pubs/factsht/71fact.htm |date=2011-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The regulations apply to all workplaces and all the provisions of the '[[Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998]]' also apply to lifting equipment.&lt;ref name="LHC LOLER"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Safe working load===
A [[safe working load]] (SWL) should, according to the regulations be marked onto lifting equipment with the relevant SWL being dependent on the configuration of the equipment, accessories for lifting such as eye bolts, lifting magnets and lifting beams should also be marked.&lt;ref name="loler 98"&gt;[http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?LegType=All+Legislation&amp;title=Lifting+Operations+and+Lifting+Equipment+Regulations+1998&amp;searchEnacted=0&amp;extentMatchOnly=0&amp;confersPower=0&amp;blanketAmendment=0&amp;sortAlpha=0&amp;TYPE=QS&amp;PageNumber=1&amp;NavFrom=0&amp;parentActiveTextDocId=2788396&amp;ActiveTextDocId=2788396&amp;filesize=66680 Loler 1998 - Regulation 7]&lt;/ref&gt;  The load itself would be based on the maximum load that the equipment can lift safely.  Lifting equipment that is designed for lifting people must also be appropriately and clearly marked.&lt;ref name="loler 98"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Passenger lifts===
The regulations stated that all lifts provided for use with work activities should be thoroughly examined by a 'competent person' at regular intervals.&lt;ref name="HSE lift guidance"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation 9 of the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations requires all employers to have their equipment thoroughly examined prior to it being put into service and after there has been any major alteration that could affect its operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/work-equipment-machinery/passenger-lifts.htm passenger lifts]  Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998 (LOLER&lt;/ref&gt; Owners or people responsible for the safe operation of a lift at work are known as 'dutyholders' and have a responsibility to ensure that the lift has been thoroughly examined and is safe to use.  Lifts when in use should be thoroughly examined every six months if, at any time, the lift has been used to carry people.  Lifts used to only carry loads should be examined every 12 months.&lt;ref name="HSE lift guidance"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Any substantial or significant changes should have been made to the equipment then this would also require an examination as would any change in operating condition which is likely to affect the integrity of the equipment.&lt;ref name="HSE lift guidance"&gt;[http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/indg339.pdf HSE - Thorough examination and testing of lifts - simple guidance]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LOLER Inspections ===
These are a legal requirement and should be carried out by a competent person, usually your insurance company will request a 3rd party independent Inspector. These inspections should be carried out at 6month intervals for all lifting items and 12 months for those that could be covered by [[Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998|PUWER]] although a competent person may deem different time scales:

Standards state that as a minimum;
* Every six months for lifting equipment used for lifting/lowering persons.
* Every six months for lifting accessories.
* Every 12 months for all other lifting equipment not falling into either of the above categories
* A competent person may deem different time scale

==Prosecutions arising from the regulations==
On 17 January 2011 a Liverpool nursing home was fined £18,000 after Frances Shannon, an 81-year-old woman fell to the ground whilst being lifted out of bed.

The Christopher Grange nursing home run by the Catholic Blind Institute was prosecuted by the health and safety executive for failing to carry out regular checks of the sling equipment which was used to lift Mrs Shannon, who suffered a broken shoulder and injuries to her back and elbow.  

Taken to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Mrs Shannon died the day following the incident.  Speaking of the prosecution Sarah Wadham, the HSE's inspecting officer, said that the incident could have been prevented, saying to the press "There should have been regular checks of the sling and it should have been thoroughly examined at least once every six months. Sadly this did not happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moderngov.rotherham.gov.uk/documents/s43180/BULLETIN%20March%2011.pdf|title=Rotherham Local Government Bulletin March 2011|last=Team|first=Emergency and Safety|date=March 2011|website=Rotherham Local Government|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Catholic Blind Institute was charged under section 9 of the Lifting Operation and Lifting Equipment regulations and ordered to also pay £13,876 costs.

==Requirements That LOLER 1998 Places On Employers and Workers== 
LOLER 1998 essentially puts in place four key protocols that all employers and workers must abide by:
1) All equipment must be safe and suitable for purpose    
The manufacturer must identify any hazards associated with the equipment in question, they must  then assess these hazards to bring them down to acceptable levels. All lifting equipment is normally put through an independent type testing process to establish that it will safely perform the tasks required to one of the below standards.
• BS (British Standard, used mainly in the UK)
• ISO Standards (International Standard)
• EN ([[Euronorm]], used throughout Europe)
• CEN/CENELEC (Euronorm Standards)
The above standards are a published specification that establishes a common language and contains a technical specification or other precise criteria. They are designed to be used consistently as a rule, guideline or definition.

2) All personnel must be suitably trained.
All manufacturers of lifting equipment are obliged to send out instructions for use of all products. 
The employer is then obliged to make sure employees are aware of these instructions and use the lifting equipment correctly.
To achieve this the employees must be competent. Competence is achieved through experience, technical knowledge and training. 

3) All equipment must be maintained in a safe condition.
It is good practice for all personnel using lifting equipment to conduct a pre-use inspection on all items.
Regulation 9 of LOLER also outlines specific requirements for the formal inspection of lifting equipment at mandatory intervals. 
These inspections are to be performed by a competent person and the findings of the inspections recorded.
Maximum fixed periods for thorough examinations and inspection of lifting equipment as stated in regulation 9 of LOLER are:
•Lifting Accessories – 6 Months
•Lifting Appliances – 12 Months
•Man Riding Equipment – 6 Months
Or in accordance with a written scheme of examination. Any inspection record must be made in line with the requirements of schedule 1 of LOLER
The only exception to this is: If the lifting equipment has not been used before and; In the case of lifting equipment issued with an EC declaration of conformity, the employer has possession of such declaration and it is not made more than 12 months before the lifting equipment is put into service.

== LOLER &amp; Record Keeping ==
You are legally required to ensure that reports of thorough examinations are kept available for consideration by health and safety inspectors for at least two years or until the next report, whichever is longer.

Records must be kept for all equipment. All equipment manufactured should be given a “birth certificate”.  This should prove that when first made, it complied with any requirement.  In Europe today, this document would normally be an EC Declaration of conformity plus a manufacturers certificate if called for by the standard worked to.

They may be kept electronically as long as you can provide a written report if requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.garageequipmentonline.com/loler-puwer-and-mvr|title=Loler, Puwer and MVR|last=Pengelly|first=Jason|date=21 March 2017|website=Garage Equipment Online|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses|Madi (disambiguation)}}

'''Madí''' (or MADI; also known as Grupo Madí or Arte Madí) is an international abstract (or concrete) art movement initiated in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1946 by the Hungarian-Argentinian artist and poet [[Gyula Kosice]], and the Uruguayans [[Carmelo Arden Quin]] and [[Rhod Rothfuss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Made in Madí: Nelson Di Maggio, curador de retrospectiva sobre Carmelo Arden Quin|url=http://ladiaria.com.uy/articulo/2010/11/made-in-madi/|publisher=La Diaria|accessdate=14 June 2012|author=Riccardo Boglione|date=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement focuses on creating [[concrete art]] (i.e., non-representational [[geometric abstraction]]) and encompasses all branches of art (the plastic and pictorial arts, music, literature, theater, architecture, dance, etc.). The artists in the Madí movement consider the concrete, physical reality of the art medium and play with the traditional conventions of [[Western art history|Western art]] (for instance, by creating works on irregularly-shaped canvases).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1193621/Concrete-Invention "Concrete Invention."] ''Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010. Web. 30 Dec. 2010. &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1193621/Concrete-Invention&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Artwork of Madí movement appeared in eight issues of its magazine, ''[[Arte Madí Universal]]'', published between 1947 and 1954.

== Historical Context ==
The Madí art movement formed as a reaction to the major concrete art movement in Argentina at the time, known as the [[Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención]] (AACI), whose art was perceived by the Madí group as being too strict in their method of creating concrete art, resulting in a lack of expression in their artworks. 

Operating under the rule of Colonel [[Juan Perón|Perón]], whose time in power was characterized by a volatile political climate, the Madí artists used their art to make statements with social and political implications. One of the most overt criticisms made by the Madí movement criticized cultural authorities in the ''[[Arte Madí Universal]]'' magazine'','' commenting "[t]he last submission to the Venice Biennial has signified for Argentina a blunt negation of the new [artistic] values. We invite competent authorities to stop and compare the true current of contemporary plastic arts with the submissions that today put us [our country] half a century behind", which vaguely attack the aesthetic choices of certain cultural officers under Perón. According to [[Pérez-Barreiro]], Madí and Concrete art (referring to the [[Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención]] (AACI)) are the artistic parallel(s) of the political phenomenon of [[Peronism]]. These artists were also seen as combining modern art with Communist ideology. Some scholars, including Barreiro, saw the government was an outspoken critic against concrete art as a whole, whereas others such as [[Andrea Giunta]] assert that the Madí and Concrete groups were not victimized under Perón's regime; rather, they "coexisted on its margins".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The political regime of Perón made use of both linguistic and visual images for propaganda purposes. This is seen in his use of an image, "the shirtless workers" (los descamisados), as an alternative to the concept of the working class. This image had strong connections and connotations with the male worker, shirtless and, unrealistically, without much affliction. In a speech given October 17th, 1946 at Plaza de Mayo, Perón addressed the workers in speeches as "mis queridos descamisados" (my loving shirtless workers). At this speech, he declared October 17th the "Day of the Shirtless Workers" and stated "I don’t want to govern over men but over their hearts, because mine beats in unison with the heart of each shirtless worker, which I interpret and love above all things.” The use of representations to create propaganda opened up a clear target for the Madí artists to oppose.

== Origin of the name ==
Gyula Kosice, who also operated under the pseudonym Raymundo Rasas Pèt, has explained that the name for the movement is derived from the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] motto in the [[Spanish Civil War]], "''Madrí, Madrí, no pasarán''" ("Madrid, Madrid, they will not make it in", i.e., the [[Francisco Franco|Francoist forces]] will not invade Madrid).&lt;ref&gt;[http://misitio.fibertel.com.ar/niusletercultura/Content40181.shtml "Entrevista a Gyula Kosice"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120629170755/http://misitio.fibertel.com.ar/niusletercultura/Content40181.shtml |date=29 June 2012 }}, ''Ñusleter Cultura'', 12 de agosto de 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is most typically understood as an acronym for ''Movimiento, Abstracción, Dimensión, Invención'' (Movement, Abstraction, Dimension, Invention).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Characteristics ==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}
A Madí work is non-figurative and non-representational; it has a cut-out or irregularly-shaped form, which takes away the viewer's perception of spatial depth that a rectangular frame provides; its colors are flat and sharply defined; it is often three-dimensional and sometimes articulated and/or mechanical; and it is playful in spirit. Madí artists were concerned with creating artworks that were autonomous with functions that naturally transcend the physical features that constitute the work. Introducing elements of transformation and ambiguity were techniques commonly employed by these artists to avoid representation as well as avoid the fixity of representations. In painted works, some artists would intentionally lower the legibility of the design.

The incorporation of unusual materials into artworks is seen throughout the art movement movement; this includes Plexiglas, fluorescent tubes, neon lights, water, metal, and other materials. An example of this is seen in [[Gyula Kosice|Kosice's]] first hydraulic piece, ''La arquitectura del agua: Hidro-escultura (The Architecture of Water: Hydro-Sculpture)'', which utilized light and water interaction.

Madí artists sought to combat representational forms because this art reflected and perpetuated class-based social organizations. They believed that representational images "forced others to relate to concepts, connotations, and feelings which were superfluous to the object itself... which enticed individuals into supporting class-based organizations". The Concrete art they produced was meant to have a reality that was self-contained. In other words, the reality of the art ended in the object. In the minds of the Madí artists, "Concrete art was worthy as a contribution to social liberation" because it helped its audience grasp true reality while standing against the concepts, connotations and feelings associated with art. To state this differently, exposing people to what is actually reality allows people to eventually confront myths perpetuated by the bourgeois that has suppressed revolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Madí is perhaps the sole remaining art movement which can boast of a half-century of uninterrupted activity since its creation in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1946. Today, the MADI movement has over 60 members — painters, sculptors, architects and poets — working in France, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Hungary, Japan, [[Argentina]] and the United States. One prominent figure behind this fifty years of artistic creation is [[Carmelo Arden Quin]].

== The Madí Manifesto ==
The Madí Manifesto was created to defend the importance of invention in the light of limitations imposed on concrete art by the excessive rationalism of European concrete art. This strictness of form in concrete art was also demonstrated by the [[Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención]] (AACI). The manifesto also called for "the integration of the nonorthogonal framework into representational space".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geometric Abstraction: Latin American Art from the Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Collection|last=Bois|first=Yve-Alan|publisher=Harvard University Art Museums|year=2001|isbn=|location=Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Madí Dictionary ==
In written works, artists "disrupted the construction of semantically coherent structures" to avoid attaching meaning to the art and the possibility of representation. The Madí created a dictionary that accomplished the opposite of what a normal dictionary does in that it confused and distorted the meanings of words and made up words. The following excerpt is from the Madí dictionary, which demonstrates a correct grammatical structure that relates ideas that are impossible to interpret meaningfully.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is an example of this incoherent construction which prevents interpretation:&lt;blockquote&gt;M               &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Maclode: Upward hill. / Slope to insinuate land.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Meril: Kidnapping of flat centimeters. / ''Madícional'' [‘Madí-like’ or ‘of Madí origin’] opposition and resistance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Miogue: Account of events in which the authors of great answers participated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Molois: Site where the most varied adjectives are collected. / ''Fam''. Insult.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Musver: About the manner to focus in photography the liveliest glare of a childhood memory. / Fixation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Macichud: Line of shade that emits a loosening of gray beams.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;N&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nandy: Arrangement for new personal cuño.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nem-Er: Record of instances.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nigs: Opening that is left so that a cluster of enchanted powder emigrates.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Novoh: Shooter that the riverside authority exercises to learn the coastal ruling&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Selected Artists and Artworks ==
Representatives of the Madí movement, in addition to Kosice, Quin and Rothfuss, include [[Martín Blaszko]], [[Waldo Longo]], [[Juan Bay]], [[Esteban Eitler]], [[Diyi Laañ]], and [[Valdo Wellington]], among others.

== Why MADI? ==
To the question, "Why MADI?" Josee Lapeyrere, who met Arden Quin in 1962 and has since participated with her poem-objects in most of the events organized by the movement, replies: "MADI's goal is to be rigorous, inventive, gay and ludic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MADI internacional 50 años después: exposición del 7 de marzo al 3 de abril de 1996, Centro de Exposiciones y Congresos, Zaragoza|last=Osornio|first=Cesar Lopez|last2=Roitman|first2=Ibercaja|publisher=Ibercaja|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the importance to which they accord spiritual and imaginative games, even the most serious MADI artists can be described as playful. Already in 1795, Schiller focused on "the inborn playful nature of man" as an explanation for his production of art forms. In his essay, "[[Homo Ludens]]" ("Ludic Man") (1938), [[Johan Huizinga]] observed that, "Play reveals an aspiration to beauty. The terms we use to designate the elements of play are, for the most part, the same as those utilized in the aesthetic realm: beauty, tension, balancing, equilibrium, gradation, contrast, etc. Like art, play engages and delivers. It absorbs. It captivates, or, in other words, it charms. It is full of those two supremely noble qualities which man expresses through rhythm and harmony." The French art critic [[Dominique Jacquemin]] also remarks that, "It is possible that Arden Quin's passion for game playing led him to create MADI, the only remaining contemporary art movement which can pride itself in possessing both coherence and a truly international outlook."

The '''microbial loop''' describes a trophic pathway in the marine microbial food web where [[dissolved organic carbon]] (DOC) is returned to higher trophic levels via its incorporation into bacterial biomass, and then coupled with the classic food chain formed by [[phytoplankton]]-[[zooplankton]]-[[nekton]]. The term microbial loop was coined by [[Farooq Azam]] and [[Tom Fenchel]] et al.&lt;ref name=AzamFenchel1983&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Azam |first1=Farooq |authorlink1=Farooq Azam |last2=Fenchel |first2=Tom |authorlink2=Tom Fenchel |last3=Field |first3=JG |last4=Gray |first4=JS |last5=Meyer-Reil |first5=LA |last6=Thingstad |first6=F |title=The Ecological Role of Water-Column Microbes in the Sea |journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series |volume=10 |year=1983 |pages=257–263 |doi=10.3354/meps010257}}&lt;/ref&gt; to include the role played by bacteria in the carbon and nutrient cycles of the marine environment.

In general, [[dissolved organic carbon]] (DOC) is introduced into the ocean environment from bacterial lysis, the leakage or exudation of fixed carbon from phytoplankton (e.g., mucilaginous exopolymer from [[diatom]]s), sudden cell senescence, sloppy feeding by zooplankton, the excretion of waste products by aquatic animals, or the breakdown or dissolution of organic particles from terrestrial plants and soils (Van den Meersche ''et al.'' 2004). Bacteria in the microbial loop decompose this particulate detritus to utilize this energy-rich matter for growth. Since more than 95% of organic matter in marine ecosystems consists of polymeric, high [[molecular weight]] (HMW) compounds (e.g., protein, polysaccharides, lipids), only a small portion of total [[dissolved organic matter]] (DOM) is readily utilizable to most marine organisms at higher trophic levels. This means that dissolved organic carbon is not available directly to most marine organisms; marine bacteria introduce this organic carbon into the food web, resulting in additional energy becoming available to higher trophic levels. Recently the term "[[microbial food web]]" has been substituted for the term "microbial loop".

== History ==
Prior to the discovery of the microbial loop, the classic view of marine [[food web]]s was one of a linear chain from [[phytoplankton]] to [[nekton]]. Generally, marine [[bacteria]] were not thought to be significant consumers of organic matter (including carbon), although they were known to exist. However, the view of a marine pelagic food web was challenged during the 1970s and 1980s by Pomeroy and Azam, who suggested the alternative pathway of carbon flow from bacteria to [[protozoan]]s to [[metazoan]]s.

Early work in marine ecology that investigated the role of bacteria in oceanic environments concluded their role to be very minimal. Traditional methods of counting bacteria (e.g., culturing on [[agar plate]]s) only yielded small numbers of bacteria that were much smaller than their true ambient abundance in seawater. Developments in technology for counting bacteria have led to an understanding of the significant importance of marine bacteria in oceanic environments

In the 1970s, the alternative technique of direct [[Bacterioplankton counting methods|microscopic counting]] was developed by Francisco ''et al.'' (1973) and Hobbie ''et al.'' (1977). Bacterial cells were counted with an [[epifluorescence microscope]], producing what is called an 
"acridine orange direct count" (AODC). This led to a reassessment of the large concentration of bacteria in seawater, which was found to be more than was expected (typically on the order of 1 million per milliliter). Also, development of the "bacterial productivity assay" showed that a large fraction (i.e. 50%) of net [[primary production]] (NPP) was processed by marine bacteria.

In 1974, Larry Pomeroy published a paper in BioScience entitled “The Ocean’s Food Web: A Changing Paradigm”, where the key role of microbes in ocean productivity was highlighted. In the early 1980s, Azam and a panel of top ocean scientists published the synthesis of their discussion in the journal ''Marine Ecology Progress Series'' entitled “The Ecological Role of Water Column Microbes in the Sea”. The term ‘microbial loop’ was introduced in this paper, which noted that the bacteria-consuming protists were in the same size class as phytoplankton and likely an important component of the diet of planktonic [[crustacean]]s.

Evidence accumulated since this time has indicated that some of these [[bacterivore|bacterivorous]] protists (such as [[ciliate]]s) are actually selectively preyed upon by these [[copepod]]s. In 1986, ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'', which is found in high abundance in oligotrophic areas of the ocean, was discovered by Chisholm, Olson, and other collaborators (although there had been several earlier records of very small [[cyanobacteria]] containing [[chlorophyll b]] in the ocean). Stemming from this discovery, researchers observed the changing role of marine bacteria along a nutrient gradient from eutrophic to oligotrophic areas in the ocean.

== Factors controlling the microbial loop ==
The efficiency of the microbial loop is determined by the density of marine bacteria within it (Taylor and Joint 1990). It has become clear that bacterial density is mainly controlled by the grazing activity of small protozoans and various taxonomic groups of flagellates. Also, viral infection causes bacterial lysis, which release cell contents back into the [[dissolved organic matter]] (DOM) pool, lowering the overall efficiency of the microbial loop. Mortality from viral infection has almost the same magnitude as that from protozoan grazing. However, compared to protozoan grazing, the effect of viral lysis can be very different because lysis is highly host-specific to each marine bacteria. Both protozoan grazing and viral infection balance the major fraction of bacterial growth. In addition, the microbial loop dominates in oligotrophic waters, rather than in eutrophic areas - there the classical plankton food chain predominates, due to the frequent fresh supply of mineral nutrients (e.g. spring bloom in temperate waters, [[upwelling]] areas). The magnitude of the efficiency of the microbial loop can be determined by measuring bacterial incorporation of radiolabeled substrates (such as [[tritium|tritiated]] thymidine or leucine).

== Importance in marine ecosystems ==
The microbial loop is of particular importance in increasing the efficiency of the marine food web via the utilization of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which is typically unavailable to most marine organisms. In this sense, the process aids in recycling of organic matter and nutrients and mediates the transfer of energy above the [[thermocline]]. More than 30% of [[dissolved organic carbon]] (DOC) incorporated into bacteria is respired and released as [[carbon dioxide]]. The other main effect of the microbial loop in the water column is that it accelerates [[Mineralization (biology)|mineralization]] through regenerating production in nutrient-limited environments (e.g. oligotrophic waters). In general, the entire microbial loop is to some extent typically five to ten times the mass of all multicellular marine organisms in the marine ecosystem. Marine bacteria are the base of the food web in most oceanic environments, and they improve the trophic efficiency of both marine food webs and important aquatic processes (such as the productivity of fisheries and the amount of carbon exported to the ocean floor). Therefore, the microbial loop, together with primary production, controls the productivity of marine systems in the ocean.

Many planktonic bacteria are motile, using a flagellum to propagate, and [[chemotaxis|chemotax]] to locate, move toward, and attach to a point source of [[dissolved organic matter]] (DOM) where fast growing cells digest all or part of the particle. Accumulation within just a few minutes at such patches is directly observable. Therefore, the water column can be considered to some extent as a spatially organized place on a small scale rather than a completely mixed system. This patch formation affects the biologically-mediated transfer of matter and energy in the microbial loop.

More currently, the microbial loop is considered to be more extended (Kerner, Hohenberg, Ertl, Reckermannk, Spitzy 2003). Chemical compounds in typical bacteria (such as DNA, lipids, sugars, etc.) and similar values of C:N ratios per particle are found in the microparticles formed abiotically. Microparticles are a potentially attractive food source to bacterivorous plankton. If this is the case, the microbial loop can be extended by the pathway of direct transfer of [[dissolved organic matter]] (DOM) via abiotic microparticle formation to higher trophic levels. This has ecological importance in two ways. First, it occurs without carbon loss, and makes organic matter more efficiently available to phagotrophic organisms, rather than only heterotrophic bacteria. Furthermore, abiotic transformation in the extended microbial loop depends only on temperature and the capacity of DOM to aggregate, while biotic transformation is dependent on its biological availability (Kerner, Hohenberg, Ertl, Reckermannk, Spitzy 2003).

== Processes ==
Nitrogen is present in the environment in a wide variety of chemical forms including organic nitrogen, [[ammonium]] (NH{{su|b=4|p=+}}), [[nitrite]] (NO{{su|b=2|p=−}}), [[nitrate]] (NO{{su|b=3|p=−}}), [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[nitric oxide]] (NO) or inorganic nitrogen gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Organic nitrogen may be in the form of a living organism, [[humus]] or in the intermediate products of organic matter decomposition. The processes in the nitrogen cycle is to transform nitrogen from one form to another. Many of those processes are carried out by [[microorganism|microbes]], either in their effort to harvest energy or to accumulate nitrogen in a form needed for their growth. For example, the [[metabolic waste#Nitrogen wastes|nitrogenous wastes]] in animal [[urine]] are broken down by [[nitrifying bacteria]] in the soil to be used as new. The diagram {besides} alongside shows how these processes fit together to form the nitrogen cycle.

=== Nitrogen fixation ===
{{Main article|Nitrogen fixation}}
The conversion of nitrogen gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into nitrates and nitrites through atmospheric, industrial and biological processes is called nitrogen fixation. 
Atmospheric nitrogen must be processed, or "[[nitrogen fixation|fixed]]", into a usable form to be taken up by plants. Between 5x10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; and 10x10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; g per year are fixed by [[lightning]] strikes, but most fixation is done by free-living or [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] [[bacterium|bacteria]] known as [[diazotrophs]]. These bacteria have the [[nitrogenase]] [[enzyme]] that combines gaseous nitrogen with [[hydrogen]] to produce [[ammonia]], which is converted by the bacteria into other [[organic compound]]s. Most biological nitrogen fixation occurs by the activity of Mo-nitrogenase, found in a wide variety of bacteria and some [[Archaea]]. Mo-nitrogenase is a complex two-component [[enzyme]] that has multiple metal-containing prosthetic groups.&lt;ref name= MoirJWB&gt;{{cite book | author= Moir, JWB (editor) | year=2011 | title=Nitrogen Cycling in Bacteria: Molecular Analysis | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-904455-86-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of free-living bacteria is ''[[Azotobacter]]''.  Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria such as ''[[Rhizobium]]'' usually live in the root nodules of [[legumes]] (such as peas, alfalfa, and locust trees). Here they form a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship with the plant, producing ammonia in exchange for [[carbohydrate]]s. Because of this relationship, legumes will often increase the nitrogen content of nitrogen-poor soils. A few non-legumes can also form such [[symbiosis|symbioses]]. Today, about 30% of the total fixed nitrogen is produced industrially using the [[Haber-Bosch]] process,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, B., R. L. Richards, and W. E. Newton. 2004. Catalysts for nitrogen fixation : nitrogenases, relevant chemical models and commercial processes. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht ; Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; which uses high temperatures and pressures to convert nitrogen gas and a hydrogen source (natural gas or petroleum) into ammonia.&lt;ref name=Smil&gt;{{cite book |author=Smil, V |year=2000 |title=Cycles of Life |publisher=Scientific American Library, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assimilation ===
{{Main article|Assimilation (biology)|Nitrogen assimilation}}
Plants can absorb nitrate or ammonium from the soil via their root hairs. If nitrate is absorbed, it is first reduced to nitrite ions and then ammonium ions for incorporation into amino acids, nucleic acids, and chlorophyll.&lt;ref name=Smil/&gt; In plants that have a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia, some nitrogen is assimilated in the form of ammonium ions directly from the nodules. It is now known that there is a more complex cycling of amino acids between ''Rhizobia'' bacteroids and plants. The plant provides amino acids to the bacteroids so ammonia assimilation is not required and the bacteroids pass amino acids (with the newly fixed nitrogen) back to the plant, thus forming an interdependent relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Willey|first=Joanne M.|title=Prescott's Microbiology 8th Ed|year=2011|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=978-0-07-337526-7|pages=705}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many animals, fungi, and other [[heterotrophic]] organisms obtain nitrogen by ingestion of [[amino acid]]s, [[nucleotide]]s, and other small organic molecules, other heterotrophs (including many [[bacteria]]) are able to utilize inorganic compounds, such as ammonium as sole N sources.  Utilization of various N sources is carefully regulated in all organisms.

=== Ammonification ===
When a plant or animal dies or an animal expels waste, the initial form of nitrogen is [[organic matter|organic]]. Bacteria or fungi convert the organic nitrogen within the remains back into [[ammonium]] (NH{{su|b=4|p=+}}), a process called ammonification or [[Mineralization (soil)|mineralization]]. Enzymes involved are:
* GS: Gln Synthetase (Cytosolic &amp; Plastic)
* GOGAT: Glu 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase ([[Ferredoxin]] &amp; NADH-dependent)
* GDH: Glu Dehydrogenase:
** Minor Role in ammonium assimilation.
** Important in amino acid catabolism.

=== Nitrification ===
{{Main article|Nitrification}}
The conversion of ammonium to nitrate is performed primarily by soil-living bacteria and other nitrifying bacteria. In the primary stage of nitrification, the oxidation of ammonium (NH{{su|b=4|p=+}}) is performed by bacteria such as the ''[[Nitrosomonas]]'' species, which converts ammonia to [[nitrites]] ({{NO2-}}). Other bacterial species such as ''[[Nitrobacter]]'', are responsible for the oxidation of the nitrites ({{NO2-}}) into [[nitrates]] ({{NO3-}}).&lt;ref name=Smil/&gt; It is important for the ammonia ({{NH3}}) to be converted to nitrates or nitrites because ammonia gas is toxic to plants.

Due to their very high [[solubility]] and because soils are highly unable to retain [[anions]], nitrates can enter [[groundwater]]. Elevated nitrate in groundwater is a concern for drinking water use because nitrate can interfere with blood-oxygen levels in infants and cause [[methemoglobinemia]] or blue-baby syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nitrogen Cycle|url=http://extension.missouri.edu/p/WQ252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vitousek&gt;{{cite journal |year=1997 |title= Human alteration of the global nitrogen cycle: Sources and consequences |journal=Issues in Ecology |volume=1 |pages=1–17 |author1=Vitousek, PM |author2=Aber, J |author3=Howarth, RW |author4=Likens, GE |author5=Matson, PA |author6=Schindler, DW |author7=Schlesinger, WH |author8=Tilman, GD | doi=10.1890/1051-0761(1997)007[0737:HAOTGN]2.0.CO;2 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Where groundwater recharges stream flow, nitrate-enriched groundwater can contribute to [[eutrophication]], a process that leads to high algal population and growth, especially blue-green algal populations. While not directly toxic to fish life, like ammonia, nitrate can have indirect effects on fish if it contributes to this eutrophication. Nitrogen has contributed to severe eutrophication problems in some water bodies. Since 2006, the application of nitrogen [[fertilizer]] has been increasingly controlled in Britain and the United States. This is occurring along the same lines as control of phosphorus fertilizer, restriction of which is normally considered essential to the recovery of eutrophied waterbodies.

=== Denitrification ===
{{Main|Denitrification}}
Denitrification is the reduction of nitrates back into nitrogen gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), completing the nitrogen cycle. This process is performed by bacterial species such as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' and ''[[Clostridium]]'' in anaerobic conditions.&lt;ref name=Smil/&gt; They use the nitrate as an electron acceptor in the place of oxygen during respiration. These facultatively (meaning optionally) anaerobic bacteria can also live in aerobic conditions. Denitrification happens in anaerobic conditions e.g. waterlogged soils. The denitrifying bacteria use nitrates in the soil to carry out respiration and consequently produce nitrogen gas, which is inert and unavailable to plants.

=== Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium ===
{{Main|Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium}}
Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium&amp;nbsp;(DNRA), or nitrate/nitrite ammonification, is an [[anaerobic respiration]]&amp;nbsp;process.&amp;nbsp;Microbes which undertake DNRA oxidise organic matter and use nitrate as an electron acceptor, reducing it to&amp;nbsp;[[nitrite]], then&amp;nbsp;[[ammonium]]&amp;nbsp;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;→NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;→NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lam, Phyllis and Kuypers, Marcel M. M.|first=|date=2011|title=Microbial Nitrogen Processes in Oxygen Minimum Zones|url=|journal=Annual Review of Marine Science|volume=3|pages=317–345}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both denitrifying and nitrate ammonification bacteria will be competing for nitrate in the environment, although DNRA acts to conserve bioavailable nitrogen as soluble ammonium rather than producing dinitrogen gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marchant, H. K., Lavik, G., Holtappels, M., and Kuypers, M. M.

=== Anaerobic ammonia oxidation ===
{{Main article|Ammonia}}
In this biological process, [[nitrite]] and [[ammonia]] are converted directly into molecular [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) gas. This process makes up a major proportion of nitrogen conversion in the oceans.  The balanced formula for this "[[anammox]]" chemical reaction is:  NH{{su|b=4|p=+}} + NO{{su|b=2|p=−}} &amp;rarr; N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (Δ''G''° = {{val|-357 |u=kJ.mol-1}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anammox|url=https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Anammox|website=Anammox - MicrobeWiki|publisher=MicrobeWiki|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other processes ===
Though nitrogen fixation is the primary source of plant-available nitrogen in most [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]], in areas with nitrogen-rich [[bedrock]], the breakdown of this rock also serves as a nitrogen source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/09/06/140206913/discovery-forces-scientists-to-rethink-nitrogen|title=Nitrogen Study Could 'Rock' A Plant's World|date=2011-09-06|accessdate=2011-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schuur | first1 = E.

==Marine nitrogen cycle==

[[File:Marine Nitrogen Cycle.jpg|thumb|A schematic representing the Marine Nitrogen Cycle]]
The nitrogen cycle is an important process in the ocean as well. While the overall cycle is similar, there are different players&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moulton |first1=Orissa M |last2=Altabet |first2=Mark A |last3=Beman |first3=J Michael |last4=Deegan |first4=Linda A |last5=Lloret |first5=Javier |last6=Lyons |first6=Meaghan K |last7=Nelson |first7=James A |last8=Pfister |first8=Catherine A |title=Microbial associations with macrobiota in coastal ecosystems: patterns and implications for nitrogen cycling |journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment |date=May 2016 |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=200–208 |doi=10.1002/fee.1262 |url=https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/fee.1262 |language=en |issn=1540-9295}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modes of transfer for nitrogen in the ocean. Nitrogen enters the water through the precipitation, runoff, or as N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere. Nitrogen cannot be utilized by [[phytoplankton]] as N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; so it must undergo nitrogen fixation which is performed predominately by [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref name="Miller 2008 60–62"&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Charles|title=Biological Oceanography|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|location=350 Main Street, Malden, MA 02148 USA|isbn=978-0-632-05536-4|pages=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without supplies of fixed nitrogen entering the marine cycle, the fixed nitrogen would be used up in about 2000 years.&lt;ref name="Gruber 2008 1–35"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gruber|first=Nicolas|title=Nitrogen in the Marine Environment|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier|location=30 Corporate Drive, Suite 400, Burlington, MA 01803|isbn=978-0-12-372522-6|pages=1–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phytoplankton need nitrogen in biologically available forms for the initial synthesis of organic matter.  Ammonia and urea are released into the water by excretion from plankton. Nitrogen sources are removed from the [[Photic zone|euphotic zone]] by the downward movement of the organic matter. This can occur from sinking of phytoplankton, vertical mixing, or sinking of waste of vertical migrators. The sinking results in ammonia being introduced at lower depths below the euphotic zone. Bacteria are able to convert ammonia to nitrite and nitrate but they are inhibited by light so this must occur below the euphotic zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Charles|title=Biological oceanography|year=2008|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd|location=350 Main Street, Malden, MA 02148 USA|isbn=978-0-632-05536-4|pages=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonification or [[Mineralization (geology)|Mineralization]] is performed by bacteria to convert organic nitrogen to ammonia. [[Nitrification]] can then occur to convert the ammonium to nitrite and nitrate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyes, Elliot|first=Susan, Michael|title=Learning Unit: Nitrogen Cycle Marine Environment|url=http://www.chemgapedia.de/vsengine/vlu/vsc/en/ch/16/uc/vlus/nitrogenmarine.vlu.html|accessdate=22 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415123617/http://www.chemgapedia.de/vsengine/vlu/vsc/en/ch/16/uc/vlus/nitrogenmarine.vlu.html|archivedate=15 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrate can be returned to the euphotic zone by vertical mixing and upwelling where it can be taken up by phytoplankton to continue the cycle. N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be returned to the atmosphere through [[denitrification]].

Ammonium is thought to be the preferred source of fixed nitrogen for phytoplankton because its assimilation does not involve a [[redox]] reaction and therefore requires little energy. Nitrate requires a redox reaction for assimilation but is more abundant so most phytoplankton have adapted to have the enzymes necessary to undertake this reduction ([[nitrate reductase]]). There are a few notable and well-known exceptions that include [[Prochlorococcus]] and some [[Synechococcus]].&lt;ref name="Gruber 2008 1–35"/&gt; These species can only take up nitrogen as ammonium.

The nutrients in the ocean are not uniformly distributed. Areas of upwelling provide supplies of nitrogen from below the euphotic zone. Coastal zones provide nitrogen from runoff and upwelling occurs readily along the coast. However, the rate at which nitrogen can be taken up by phytoplankton is decreased in [[oligotrophic]] waters year-round and temperate water in the summer resulting in lower primary production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lalli, Parsons|first=Carol, Timothy|title=Biological oceanography: An introduction|year=1997|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0-7506-3384-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of the different forms of nitrogen varies throughout the oceans as well.

Nitrate is depleted in near-surface water except in upwelling regions. Coastal upwelling regions usually have high nitrate and [[chlorophyll]] levels as a result of the increased production. However, there are regions of high surface nitrate but low chlorophyll that are referred to as [[HNLC]] (high nitrogen, low chlorophyll) regions. The best explanation for HNLC regions relates to iron scarcity in the ocean, which may play an important part in ocean dynamics and nutrient cycles. The input of iron varies by region and is delivered to the ocean by dust (from dust storms) and leached out of rocks. Iron is under consideration as the true limiting element to ecosystem productivity in the ocean.

Ammonium and nitrite show a maximum concentration at 50–80 m (lower end of the euphotic zone) with decreasing concentration below that depth. This distribution can be accounted for by the fact that nitrite and ammonium are intermediate species. They are both rapidly produced and consumed through the water column.&lt;ref name="Gruber 2008 1–35"/&gt; The amount of ammonium in the ocean is about 3 orders of magnitude less than nitrate.&lt;ref name="Gruber 2008 1–35"/&gt; Between ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate, nitrite has the fastest turnover rate. It can be produced during nitrate assimilation, nitrification, and denitrification; however, it is immediately consumed again.

===New vs. regenerated nitrogen===
Nitrogen entering the euphotic zone is referred to as new nitrogen because it is newly arrived from outside the productive layer.&lt;ref name="Miller 2008 60–62"/&gt; The new nitrogen can come from below the euphotic zone or from outside sources. Outside sources are upwelling from deep water and nitrogen fixation. If the organic matter is eaten, respired, delivered to the water as ammonia, and re-incorporated into organic matter by phytoplankton it is considered recycled/regenerated production.&lt;br /&gt;New production is an important component of the marine environment. One reason is that only continual input of new nitrogen can determine the total capacity of the ocean to produce a sustainable fish harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lalli, Parsons|first=Carol, Timothy|title=Biological Oceanography: An introduction|year=1997|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0-7506-3384-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvesting fish from regenerated nitrogen areas will lead to a decrease in nitrogen and therefore a decrease in primary production. This will have a negative effect on the system. However, if fish are harvested from areas of new nitrogen the nitrogen will be replenished.

==Human influences on the nitrogen cycle==
{{Main article|Human impact on the nitrogen cycle}}
As a result of extensive cultivation of legumes (particularly [[soy]], [[alfalfa]], and [[clover]]), growing use of the [[Haber–Bosch process]] in the creation of chemical fertilizers, and pollution emitted by vehicles and industrial plants, human beings have more than doubled the annual transfer of nitrogen into biologically available forms.&lt;ref name="Vitousek"/&gt; In addition, humans have significantly contributed to the transfer of nitrogen trace gases from Earth to the atmosphere and from the land to aquatic systems. Human alterations to the global nitrogen cycle are most intense in developed countries and in Asia, where vehicle emissions and [[industrial agriculture]] are highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holland|first1=Elisabeth A.|last2=Dentener|first2=Frank J.|last3=Braswell|first3=Bobby H.|last4=Sulzman|first4=James M.|title=Contemporary and pre-industrial global reactive nitrogen budgets|journal=Biogeochemistry|volume=46|page=7|year=1999|doi=10.1007/BF01007572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) has risen in the atmosphere as a result of agricultural fertilization, biomass burning, cattle and feedlots, and industrial sources.&lt;ref name=Chapin&gt;Chapin, S. F. III, Matson, P. A., Mooney H. A. 2002. [https://books.google.com/books?id=OOH1H779-7EC&amp;pg=PA345 ''Principles of Terrestrial Ecosystem Ecology.''] Springer, New York 2002 {{ISBN|0-387-95443-0}}, p.345&lt;/ref&gt; N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O has deleterious effects in the [[stratosphere]], where it breaks down and acts as a [[catalyst]] in the destruction of atmospheric [[ozone]]. Nitrous oxide is also a [[greenhouse gas]] and is currently the third largest contributor to [[global warming]], after [[carbon dioxide]] and [[methane]]. While not as abundant in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, it is, for an equivalent mass, nearly 300 times more potent in its ability to warm the planet.&lt;ref&gt;''Proceedings of the Scientific Committee on Problems of the Environment (SCOPE)'' International Biofuels Project Rapid Assessment, 22–25 September 2008, Gummersbach, Germany, R. W. Howarth and S. Bringezu, editors. 2009 [http://cip.cornell.edu/biofuels/ Executive Summary, p. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ammonia]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in the atmosphere has tripled as the result of human activities. It is a reactant in the atmosphere, where it acts as an [[aerosol]], decreasing air quality and clinging to water droplets, eventually resulting in [[nitric acid]] ([[Hydrogen|H]][[nitrate|NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]) that produces [[acid rain]]. Atmospheric ammonia and nitric acid also damage respiratory systems.

The very high temperature of lightning naturally produces small amounts of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, but high-temperature [[combustion]] has contributed to a 6- or 7-fold increase in the flux of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; to the atmosphere. Its production is a function of combustion temperature - the higher the temperature, the more NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is produced. [[Fossil fuel]] combustion is a primary contributor, but so are biofuels and even the burning of hydrogen. However, the rate that hydrogen is directly injected into the combustion chambers of internal combustion engines can be controlled to prevent the higher combustion temperatures that produce NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.

Ammonia and nitrous oxides actively alter [[atmospheric chemistry]]. They are precursors of [[troposphere|tropospheric]] (lower atmosphere) ozone production, which contributes to [[smog]] and [[acid rain]], damages [[plant]]s and increases nitrogen inputs to ecosystems.&lt;ref name=Smil04&gt;{{cite book |author=Smil, V |year=2004|isbn=978-0-7567-7350-2 |title=Cycles Of Life: Civilization And The Biosphere |publisher=Diane Pub Co}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecosystem]] processes can increase with [[nitrogen fertilization]], but [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] input can also result in nitrogen saturation, which weakens productivity and can damage the health of plants, animals, fish, and humans.&lt;ref name=Vitousek/&gt;

Decreases in [[biodiversity]] can also result if higher nitrogen availability increases nitrogen-demanding grasses, causing a degradation of nitrogen-poor, species-diverse [[Heath (habitat)|heathlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=20038308|author1=Aerts, Rien  |author2=Berendse, Frank |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Vegetatio|volume=76|year=1988|issue=1/2|title=The Effect of Increased Nutrient Availability on Vegetation Dynamics in Wet Heathlands|pages=63–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental impacts===
Increasing levels of [[Deposition (aerosol physics)|nitrogen deposition]] are shown to have a number of negative effects on both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bobbink|first=R.|last2=Hicks|first2=K.|last3=Galloway|first3=J.|last4=Spranger|first4=T.|last5=Alkemade|first5=R.|last6=Ashmore|first6=M.|last7=Bustamante|first7=M.|last8=Cinderby|first8=S.|last9=Davidson|first9=E.|date=2010-01-01|title=Global assessment of nitrogen deposition effects on terrestrial plant diversity: a synthesis|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=30–59|doi=10.1890/08-1140.1|issn=1939-5582}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrogen gases and aerosols can be directly toxic to certain plant species, affecting the aboveground physiology and growth of plants near large [[Point source pollution|point sources]] of nitrogen pollution. Changes to plant species interactions may also occur, as accumulation of nitrogen compounds increase its availability in a given ecosystem, eventually changing the species composition, plant diversity, and nitrogen cycling. Ammonia and ammonium - two reduced forms of nitrogen - can be detrimental over time due to an increased toxicity toward sensitive species of plants,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Britto|first=Dev T.|last2=Kronzucker|first2=Herbert J.|title=NH4+ toxicity in higher plants: a critical review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0176161704702667|journal=Journal of Plant Physiology|volume=159|issue=6|pages=567–584|doi=10.1078/0176-1617-0774|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly those that are accustomed to using nitrate as their source of nitrogen, causing poor development of their roots and shoots. Increased nitrogen deposition also leads to soil acidification, which increases base cation leaching in the soil and amounts of aluminium and other potentially toxic metals, along with decreasing the amount of [[nitrification]] occurring and increasing plant-derived litter. Due to the ongoing changes caused by high nitrogen deposition, an environment's susceptibility to ecological stress and disturbance - such as pests and pathogens - may increase, thus making it less resilient to situations that otherwise would have little impact to its long-term vitality. 

Additional risks posed by increased availability of inorganic nitrogen in aquatic ecosystems include water acidification; [[eutrophication]] of fresh and saltwater systems; and toxicity issues for animals, including humans.&lt;ref&gt;Camargo, J.A. &amp; Alonso, A. (2006). Ecological and toxicological effects of inorganic nitrogen pollution in aquatics ecosystems: A global assessment. Retrieved December 10, 2010, from http://www.aseanenvironment.info/Abstract/41013039.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Eutrophication often leads to lower dissolved oxygen levels in the water column, including hypoxic and anoxic conditions, which can cause death of aquatic fauna. Relatively sessile benthos, or bottom-dwelling creatures, are particularly vulnerable because of their lack of mobility, though large fish kills are not uncommon. Oceanic [[Dead zone (ecology)|dead zones]] near the mouth of the Mississippi in the Gulf of Mexico are a well-known example of algal bloom-induced [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.33.010802.150513|author=[[Nancy Rabalais|Rabalais, Nancy N.]], R.

Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is highly toxic to fish and the level of ammonia discharged from wastewater treatment facilities must be closely monitored. To prevent fish deaths, nitrification via [[aeration]] prior to discharge is often desirable. Land application can be an attractive alternative to the aeration.

'''Noogenesis''' is the emergence and evolution of [[intelligence]].&lt;ref name=wordinfo&gt;[http://wordinfo.info/unit/1410 Noogenesis // Word Info about English Vocabulary]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Term origin ==
Noo, [[Nous|nous]] ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|n|aʊ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|n|uː|s}}) – from the [[ancient Greek]] {{lang|en|[[Wiktionary: νόος|νόος]]}}, has synonyms in other languages {{lang|en|[[Wiktionary: 智慧|智慧]]}} ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]), is a term that currently encompasses the semantics: [[mind]], [[intelligence]], [[intellect]], [[reason]]; [[wisdom]]; [[insight]], [[intuition]],  [[thought]], - in a single phenomenon&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on Historical Principles|edition=3 |page=1417|year=1973|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;See entry for ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dno%2Fos νόος]'' in [[Liddell &amp; Scott]], on the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;See entry for ''[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dintellectus2 intellectus]'' in [[Lewis &amp; Short]], on the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt;.

Noogenesis was first mentioned in the posthumously published in 1955 book ''[[The Phenomenon of Man]]'' by [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], an [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] and philosopher, in a few places:
{{quote|"With and within the crisis of reflection, the next term in the series manifests itself. Psychogenesis has led to man. Now it effaces itself, relieved or absorbed by another and a higher function—the engendering and subsequent development of the mind, in one word noogenesis. When for the first time in a living creature instinct perceived itself in its own mirror, the whole world took a pace forward."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; "There is only one way in which our minds can integrate into a coherent picture of noogenesis these two essential properties of the autonomous centre of all centres, and that is to resume and complement our Principle of Emergence."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; "The idea is that of noogenesis ascending irreversibly towards Omega through the strictly limited cycle of a geogenesis."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; "To make room for thought in the world, I have needed to ' interiorise ' matter : to imagine an energetics of the mind; to conceive a noogenesis rising upstream against the flow of entropy ; to provide evolution with a direction, a line of advance and critical points..."&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] The Phenomenon of Man. Harper Torchbooks, The Cloister Library, Harper &amp; Row, Publishers, 1961, p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; —"[[Omega point]]".}}

The most widespread interpretation is thought to be "the emergence of mind, which follows geogenesis, [[biogenesis]] and [[wikt:Hominization|anthropogenesis]], forming a new sphere on [[Earth]]—[[noosphere]]".

A new understanding of the term "noogenesis" as an evolution of the intellect was proposed by A. Eryomin. A hypothesis based on [[recapitulation theory]] links the evolution of the human brain to the development of human civilization. The parallel between the amount of people living on Earth and the amount of neurons becomes more and more obvious leading us to viewing global intelligence as an analogy for human brain.
All of the people living on this planet have undoubtedly inherited the amazing cultural treasures of the past, be it production, social and intellectual ones. We are genetically hardwired to be a sort of "live RAM" of the global intellectual system. Alexey Eryomin suggests that humanity is moving towards a unified self-contained informational and intellectual system.  His research has shown the probability of Super Intellect realizing itself as Global Intelligence on Earth. We could get closer to understanding the most profound patterns and laws of the Universe if these kinds of research were given enough attention. Also, the resemblance between the individual human development and such of the whole human race has to be explored further if we are to face some of the threats of the future.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;[http://www.itogi.ru/archive/2005/26/67197.html Krivosheev S.

Therefore, generalizing and summarizing: 
{{quote|"Noogenesis—the expansion process in space and development in time (evolution) of intelligent systems (intelligent matter). Noogenesis represents a set of natural, interconnected, characterized by a certain temporal sequence of structural and functional transformations of the entire hierarchy and set of interacting among themselves on the basic structures and processes ranging from the formation and separation of the rational system to the present (the phylogenesis of the nervous systems of organisms; the evolution of humanity as [[autonomy|autonomous]] intelligent systems) or death (in the course of ontogenesis of the human brain)".&lt;ref&gt;Eryomin A.L.

== Aspects of emergence and evolution of mind ==

=== To the parameters of the phenomenon "noo", "intellectus" ===
The emergence of the human mind is considered to be one of the five fundamental phenomenons of [[emergent evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://global.britannica.com/science/emergence-science Emergence. Encyclopædia Britannica. 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt; 
To understand the mind, it is necessary to determine how human thinking differs from other thinking beings. Such differences include the ability to generate calculations, to combine dissimilar concepts, to use mental symbols, and to think abstractly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nature-wonder.livejournal.com/177318.html Hauser M. The Origin of the Mind // Scientific American. - 2009. September. 301. - P. 44-51.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325141142/http://nature-wonder.livejournal.com/177318.html |date=2010-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The knowledge of the phenomenon of intelligent systems—the emergence of reason (noogenesis) boils down to:

* Emergence and evolution of the "[[Homo sapiens|sapiens]]" (phylogenesis);
* A conception of a new idea ([[insight]], [[creativity]] synthesis, [[intuition]], [[decision-making]], [[eureka (word)|eureka]]);
* Development of an individual mind (ontogenesis );
* Appearance of the Global Intelligence concept.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Several published works which do not employ the term "noogenesis", however, address some patterns in the emergence and functioning of the human intelligence: [[working memory]] capacity  ≥ 7,&lt;ref&gt;Read D.W.

On the other hand, development of an individual's intellect deals with concepts of [[embryogenesis]], [[ontogenesis]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Haeckel]] E.

==Cultivation==
Several strains of ''Pelagibacter ubique'' have been cultured thanks to improved isolation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stingl | first1 = U. | last2 = Tripp | first2 = H.

The factors that regulate SAR11 populations are still largely unknown. They have sensors for [[nitrogen]], [[phosphate]], and [[iron]] limitation, and a very unusual requirement for reduced [[sulfur]] compounds.&lt;ref name=tripp1&gt;{{cite journal |author=H.

A population of ''P. ubique'' cells can double every 29 hours, which is fairly slow, but they can replicate under low nutrient conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Giovannoni Stephen J. | author2 = Stingl Ulrich | date = 2005 | title = Molecular diversity and ecology of microbial plankton | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 437 | issue = 7057| pages = 343–348 | doi=10.1038/nature04158 | pmid=16163344| bibcode = 2005Natur.437..343G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''P. ubique'' can be grown on a defined, artificial medium with additions of reduced sulfur, glycine, pyruvate and vitamins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Carini, Paul | display-authors = etal | date = 2012 | title = Nutrient requirements for growth of the extreme oligotroph '"Candidatus" Pelagibacter ubique' HTCC1062 on a defined medium | url = http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/vaop/ncurrent/abs/ismej2012122a.html | journal = ISME | volume = 7| issue = 3| pages = 592–602| doi=10.1038/ismej.2012.122| pmid = 23096402 | pmc = 3578571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genome==
The genome of ''P. ubique'' strain HTCC1062 was completely sequenced in 2005 showing that ''P. ubique'' has the smallest [[genome]] (1,308,759 bp) of any free living organism&lt;ref name="genome"/&gt; encoding only 1,354 open reading frames (1,389 genes total).&lt;ref name=Pelagibacter_genome&gt;{{cite web|title = Pelagibacter ubique genome| url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/491|publisher=NCBI|accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only species with smaller genomes are intracellular symbionts and parasites, such as ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'' or ''[[Nanoarchaeum equitans]]''&lt;ref name=genome/&gt; It has the smallest number of open reading frames of any free living organism, and the shortest intergenic spacers, but it still has [[metabolic pathways]] for all 20 [[amino acids]] and most co-factors.&lt;ref name="genome" /&gt; Its genome has been streamlined. This streamlining concept is important because it reduces the amount of energy required for cell replication.&lt;ref name="Pelagibacter ubique Genome" /&gt; ''P. ubique'' saves energy by using the [[base pairs]] A and T (≈70.3% of all base pairs) because they contain less [[nitrogen]], a resource that is hard for organisms to acquire.&lt;ref name="Pelagibacter ubique Genome" /&gt;

[[Non-coding RNA]]s have been identified in ''P. ubique'' through a [[bioinformatics]] screen of the published genome and metagenomic data. Examples of ncRNA found in this organisms include the [[SAM-V riboswitch]], and other [[cis-regulatory]] elements like the ''rpsB'' motif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meyer MM |title=Identification of candidate structured RNAs in the marine organism 'Candidatus Pelagibacter ubique' |journal=BMC Genomics |volume=10|pages=268 |date=2009 |pmid=19531245 |pmc=2704228 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-10-268 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2164/10/268 |accessdate=2010-09-13 |name-list-format=vanc |author2=Ames TD |author3=Smith DP |display-authors=3 |last4=Weinberg |first4=Zasha |last5=Schwalbach |first5=Michael S |last6=Giovannoni |first6=Stephen J |last7=Breaker |first7=Ronald R}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Poiata E |author2=Meyer MM |author3=Ames TD |author4=Breaker RR |title=A variant riboswitch aptamer class for S-adenosylmethionine common in marine bacteria |journal=RNA |volume=15 |issue=11 |pages=2046–56 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19776155 |pmc=2764483 |doi=10.1261/rna.1824209 |url=http://rnajournal.cshlp.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=19776155 |accessdate=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example of an important ncRNA in ''P. ubique'' and other SAR11 clade members is a conserved, glycine-activated riboswitch on malate synthase, putatively leading to "functional auxotrophy" for glycine or glycine precursors in order to achieve optimal growth.&lt;ref name=tripp2&gt;{{cite journal |author=H.

It is found to have proteorhodopsin [[genes]], which help power light-mediated [[proton pumps]]. Subtle differences arise in the expression of its [[codon]] sequences when it is subjected to either light or dark treatments. More genes for [[oxidative phosphorylation]] are expressed when it is subject to darkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Steindler Laura | display-authors = 4 | author2 = Schwalbach Michael S. | author3 = Smith Daniel P. | author4 = Chan Francis | author5 = Giovannoni Stephen J. | title = Energy Starved Candidatus Pelagibacter Ubique Substitutes Light-Mediated ATP Production for Endogenous Carbon Respiration | journal = PLOS One | volume = 6 | issue = 5| page = 9999 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0019725 | pmid=21573025 | pmc=3090418| bibcode = 2011PLoSO...619725S | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
{{see also|Bacterial taxonomy}}
The name of the genus (''Pelagibacter'') stems from the Latin masculine noun ''[[wikt:en:pelagus|pelagus]]'' ("sea") combined with the suffix [[-bacter]] (rod, bacterium), to mean "bacterium of the sea". The connecting vowel is an "i" and not an "o", as the first term is the Latin "pelagus" and not the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] original ''πέλαγος (pelagos)'' (the word ''pelagus'' is a Greek word used in Latin poetry, it is a 2nd declension noun with a Greek-like irregular nominative plural ''pelagē'' and not ''pelagi''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=pelagus entry in Perseus Digital Library|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=pelagus&amp;la=la#lexicon|website=Perseus Digital Library Project |author=Gregory R. Crane |accessdate=22 May 2011|publisher=Tufts University}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The name of the specific epithet (''ubique'') is a Latin adverb meaning "everywhere"; it should be noted species with the status Candidatus are not validly published so do not have to be grammatically correct, such as having specific epithets having to be adjectives or nouns in apposition in the nominative case or genitive nouns according to [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK8808/#A227 rule 12c] of the IBCN.&lt;ref name=code&gt;{{Cite book

'''Post literacy''' or '''post literacy education''' is a concept used in [[continuing education]] and [[adult education]] programs aimed at recently [[illiterate]] or "neo-literate" adults and communities, largely in the [[developing world]]. Unlike continuing education or [[further education]], which covers secondary or vocational topics for adult learners, Post literacy programs provide skills which might otherwise be provided in [[primary education]] settings.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Alan. [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=ED472436 Re-Thinking Adult Literacy and Post-Literacy: From an International Perspective]. The Roby Kidd Memorial Lecture.  Uppingham Press (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  Post literacy education aims to solidify literacy education, provide resources and media aimed at the newly literate, and also may create systems of non-formal education to serve these communities. Projects include providing formal continuing education, providing  written materials (the [[literate environment]]) relevant to economic development to newly literate members of developing societies, and leveraging radio and other non-written media to increase access to educational material in informal settings.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank.

The '''Rede São Paulo Saudável''' (''Healthy São Paulo Network'', in [[Portuguese language]]) is a [[satellite]]-based [[digital TV]] [[corporate video|corporate channel]], developed by the Municipal Health Secretary of [[São Paulo]], with the goal of bringing programs focused on [[health promotion]] and [[health education]], which may be watched by the entire population seeking [[health care]] in its units in the city. The network consists of two complete [[TV studio]]s, and a system for transmission of closed [[digital video]] in [[high-definition television|high definition]] via [[satellite]], with about 1,400 points of reception in all health care units of the municipality of São Paulo, including its more than 700 public health care centers and posts, medical [[clinic]]s, and 17 [[hospital]]s.

==Channel line-up==

The TV network has currently three active channels.

The first channel (the ''Citizenship Channel'') is devoted to the [[broadcast]]ing of [[health education]] directly to the population in the waiting rooms of the units. Currently more than 400 short- and medium-length TV programs with this content are part of its grid.

The second channel (the ''Professional Education Channel'') has the aim of providing [[continuing education]] and [[training]] programs to Health Secretary professionals, such as [[physician]]s, [[nurse]]s, [[dentist]]s, [[psychologist]]s, [[social worker]]s, etc., through [[distance education]]. The reception points for this channel are located in meeting rooms or [[classrooms]] inside the basic health units and hospitals.

The third channel (the "Administrative Channel") is interactive, and serves for [[meeting]]s and for corporate communication with [[Management|managers]] in general, as well as for the transmission of courses in real time. The interaction is accomplished by a [[online chat|chat]] interface, through the Internet connection of each unit, since the TV channel is unidirectional (broadcasting).

Each reception room for channels 1 and 2 has a 39" [[LCD TV]] and a digital satellite [[receiver (radio)|receiver]] conencted to an externally placed [[satellite dish]]. Channel 3 is received directly in a PC [[microcomputer]] in the administrative offices.

==Distance Education==

Several distance education courses for doctors, nurses and other health professionals are already in the air, and are freely available for the 54,000 employees of the Secretary. The courses consist or prerecorded or real time video transmissions according to a program grid, and of a public [[WWW]] site for off-class support using a [[Learning Management System]] (LMS).

The [[Centro de Formação e Desenvolvimento dos Trabalhadores da Saúde de São Paulo]] (CEFOR-SP) (''Center for Buildup and Development of Healthcare Workers'' (CEFOR-SP) and the centers for research and education of several hospitals of the public health network of São Paulo, such as the [[Hospital do Servidor Publico Municipal de São Paulo]] (''Hospital of the Public Servant of São Paulo'') are among the institutions which create and provide certification of educational content. The Healthy São Paulo Network is managed by the Technical Department of Information Technology and the Educational Technology Group of CEFOR-SP.

==Technology==

The Healthy São Paulo Network uses [[IP TV]] through [[multicasting]] via [[satellite]], using the [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] standard. The default compression used is [[H.264]] [[MPEG 4]], with a total [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] of 20 Mbit/s for the 3 channels. The São Paulo company [[SpeedCast]] is responsible for the operation of the system and for providing the [[satellite space segment]], with its [[satellite hub]] located in the city of [[Barueri]]. A virtual platform to support [[teaching]] and [[learning]] uses the  [[Moodle]] [[learning management system]] (LMS), hosted in a [[virtual dedicated server]] operated by the state company [[PRODAM]] and developed by the [[Edumed Institute for Education in Medicine and Health]].

===Television studios===

The network has two complete [[TV studio]]s, a smaller one located at the central administrative center of the Secretary of Health, in downtown São Paulo, and another, with a full [[auditorium]] with 90 seats, located at CEFOR-SP, in the neighbourhood of Moema. The studios are equipped with [[robotic camera]]s, [[document camera]]s, [[smartboard]]s, computers for presentation of slides, [[teleprompter]]s, and control desks with [[video switcher]]s, [[audio mixer]] and [[DVD]] recording capabilities

'''Repatriation''' is the return of art or [[cultural heritage]], usually referring to ancient or [[looted art]], to their country of origin or former owners (or their heirs). The disputed cultural property items are physical artifacts of a group or society that were taken from another group usually in an act of looting, whether in the context of [[imperialism]], [[colonialism]] or war. The contested objects range widely from [[sculpture]]s and paintings to monuments and human remains.

== Background ==

===War and looting===

==== Ancient world====
[[File:Victory stele of Naram Sin 9066.jpg|thumb|Victory Stele of Naram Sin, Akkadian Dynasty, reign of Naram-Sin (2254-2218 BC). Musée du Louvre, Paris.]]
War and the subsequent looting of defeated peoples has been common practice since ancient times. The stele of King [[Naram-Sin of Akkad]], which is now displayed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, is one of the earliest works of art known to have been looted in war. The stele commemorating Naram-Sin's victory in a battle against the [[Lullubi]] people in 2250 BCE was taken as war plunder about a thousand years later by the [[Elamites]] who relocated it to their capital in [[Susa]], Iran. There, it was uncovered in 1898 by French archaeologists.&lt;ref&gt;According to the Sumerian poem titled ''[[Curse of Akkad]]'', Naram-Sin was responsible for the collapse of the [[Akkadian Empire]] as he looted and destroyed the [[Temple of Enlil]] and incited the wrath of the gods as a result, see Miles, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Palladion]] was the earliest and perhaps the most important stolen statue in western literature.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Miles, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The small carved wooden statue of an armed [[Athena]] served as Troy's protective [[talisman]], which is said to have been stolen by two Greeks who secretly smuggled the statue out of the [[Temple of Athena]]. It was widely believed in antiquity that the conquest of Troy was only possible because the city had lost its protective talisman. This myth illustrates the sacramental significance of statuary in Ancient Greece as divine manifestations of the gods that symbolized power and were often believed to possess supernatural abilities. The sacred nature of the statues is further illustrated in the supposed suffering of the victorious Greeks afterward, including [[Odysseus]], who was the mastermind behind the robbery.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

According to Roman myth, Rome was founded by [[Romulus]], the first victor to dedicate spoils taken from an enemy ruler to the [[Temple of Jupiter Feretrius]]. In Rome's many subsequent wars, blood-stained armor and weaponry were gathered and placed in temples as a symbol of respect toward the enemies' deities and as a way to win their patronage.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;Miles, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; As Roman power spread throughout Italy where Greek cities once reigned, Greek art was looted and ostentatiously displayed in Rome as a triumphal symbol of foreign territories brought under Roman rule.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; However, the triumphal procession of [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] after the fall of Syracuse in 211 is believed to have set a standard of reverence to conquered sanctuaries as it engendered disapproval by critics and a negative social reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the [[Emperor Augustus]] was sufficiently embarrassed by the history of Roman plunder of Greek art to return some pieces to their original homes.&lt;ref&gt;Isager, Jacob, ''Pliny on Art and Society: The Elder Pliny's Chapters On The History Of Art'', p. 173, 2013, Routledge, {{ISBN|1-135-08580-3}}, 978-1-135-08580-3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oIwWTaEXQM0C&amp;pg=PA173 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern era====
One of the most infamous cases of esurient art plundering in wartime was the [[Nazi]] appropriation of art from both public and private holdings throughout Europe and Russia. The looting began before [[World War II]] with illegal seizures as part of a systematic persecution of Jews, which was included as a part of Nazi crimes during the [[Nuremberg Trials]].&lt;ref&gt;See film, ''Rape of Europa: The Fate of Europe's Treasures in the Third Reich and the Second World War'' by L.H. Nicholas, New York, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, Germany plundered 427 museums in the [[Soviet Union]] and ravaged or destroyed 1,670 [[Russian Orthodox]] churches, 237 [[Catholic]] churches and 532 synagogues.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"&gt;{{cite news|title=Unplundering Art|newspaper=Economist|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known recent case of wartime looting was the plundering of ancient artifacts from the [[National Museum of Iraq]] in Baghdad at the outbreak of the war in 2003. Although this was not a case in which the victors plundered art from their defeated enemy, it was result of the unstable and chaotic conditions of war that allowed looting to happen and which some would argue was the fault of the invading US forces.

Archaeologists and scholars criticized the US military for not taking the measures to secure the museum, a repository for a myriad of valuable ancient artifacts from the ancient [[Mesopotamian]] civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barry Meier and James Glanz|title=Looted treasure returning to Iraq national museum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/26/world/africa/26iht-treasure.2300298.html?_r=1|accessdate=5 November 2010|newspaper=New York Times|date=26 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the several months leading up to the war, scholars, art directors, and collector met with [[the Pentagon]] to ensure that the US government would protect Iraq's important archaeological heritage, with the National Museum in Baghdad being at the top of the list of concerns.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Greenfield, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; Between April 8, when the museum was vacated and April 12, when some of the staff returned, an estimated 15,000 items and an additional 5,000 cylinder seals were stolen.&lt;ref name="poole1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Poole|first=Robert M.|title=Looting Iraq|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/monument-sidebar.html|accessdate=4 November 2010|newspaper=Smithsonian Magazine|date=February 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120703020429/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/monument-sidebar.html|archivedate=3 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the National Library was plundered of thousands of [[cuneiform]] tablets and the building was set on fire with half a million books inside; fortunately, many of the manuscripts and books were preserved.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; A US task force was able to retrieve about half of the stolen artifacts by organizing and dispatching an inventory of missing objects and by declaring that there would be no punishment for anyone returning an item.&lt;ref name="poole1"/&gt; In addition to the vulnerability of art and historical institutions during the Iraq war, Iraq's rich archaeological sites and areas of excavated land (Iraq is presumed to possess vast undiscovered treasures) have fallen victim to widespread looting.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;Greenfield, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt; Hordes of looters disinterred enormous craters around Iraq's archaeological sites, sometimes using bulldozers.&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that between 10,000 and 15,000 archaeological sites in Iraq have been despoiled.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

=== Modern imperialism and looting ===
[[File:Paris Louvre c1845.jpg|thumb|Paris Louvre ca. 1845]]
The scale of plundering that took place under [[Napoleon]]'s French Empire was unprecedented in modern history with the only comparable looting expeditions taking place in ancient Roman history.&lt;ref&gt;Well known examples include [[Lucius Mummius]]' sack of Corinth or [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]]' plunder of Syracuse, See Miles, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the French revolutionaries justified the large-scale and systematic looting of Italy in 1796 by viewing themselves as the political successors of Rome, in the same way that ancient Romans saw themselves as the heirs of Greek civilization.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12&gt;Miles, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; They also supported their actions with the opinion that their sophisticated artistic taste would allow them to appreciate the plundered art.&lt;ref&gt;See Miles, p. 320&lt;/ref&gt; Napoleon's soldiers crudely dismantled the art by tearing paintings out of their frames hung in churches and sometimes causing damage during the shipping process.  Napoleon's soldiers appropriated private collections and even the papal collection.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13&gt;Miles, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; Of the most famous artworks plundered included the [[Horses of Saint Mark|Bronze Horses of Saint Mark]] in Venice and the [[Laocoön and His Sons]] in Rome (both since returned), with the later being considered the most impressive sculpture from antiquity at the time.

[[File:Gruppo del laocoonte, 04.JPG|thumb|left|Laocoön group, ca. 40-20 BCE. Museo Pio Clementino, Vatican]]
The Laocoön had a particular meaning for the French because it was associated with a myth in connection to the founding of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;The Laocoön was the fabled Trojan priest who warned the Trojans not to accept the Wooden Horse that the Greeks offered to Athena. A god hostile to Troy sent sea serpents to kill him and his sons, which led to the fall of Troy and heralded the eventual founding of Rome, see Miles, p. 321&lt;/ref&gt; When the art was brought into Paris, the pieces arrived in the fashion of a triumphal procession modeled after the common practice of ancient Romans.&lt;ref name=autogenerated13 /&gt;

Napoleon's extensive plunder of Italy was criticized by such French artists as [[Antoine-Chrysostôme Quatremère de Quincy]] (1755–1849), who circulated a petition that gathered the signatures of fifty other artists.&lt;ref&gt;Ironically one of the names included [[Vivant Denon]], the future Director of the [[Louvre]] and future facilitator of Napoleon's despoliation of artifacts from Egypt (see Miles, p. 326)&lt;/ref&gt; With the founding of the [[Louvre Museum]] in Paris in 1793, Napoleon's aim was to establish an encyclopedic exhibition of art history, which later both [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Adolf Hitler]] would attempt to emulate in their respective countries.&lt;ref name=autogenerated12 /&gt;

[[File:Leon Cogniet - L Expedition D Egypte Sous Les Ordres De Bonaparte.jpg|thumb|L'Expédition d'Égypte Sous Les Ordres De Bonaparte by Leon Cogniet, ca. 1835. Musée du Louvre, Paris. Depicts Napoleon and his savants studying Egypt.]]
Napoleon continued his art conquests in 1798 when he invaded Egypt in an attempt to safeguard French trade interests and to undermine Britain's access to India via Egypt. His expedition in Egypt is noted for the 167 "savants" he took with him including scientists and other specialists equipped with tools for recording, surveying and documenting ancient and modern Egypt and its natural history.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the expedition discoveries included the [[Rosetta Stone]] and the [[Valley of the Kings]] near Thebes. The French military campaign was short-lived and unsuccessful and the majority of the collected artifacts (including the Rosetta Stone) were seized by British troops, ending up in the [[British Museum]]. Nonetheless, the information gathered by the French expedition was soon after published in the several volumes of ''[[Description de l'Égypte]]'', which included 837 copperplate engravings and over 3,000 drawings. In contrast to the disapproving public reaction to the looting of Italian works of art, the appropriation of Egyptian art saw widespread interest and fascination throughout Europe, inciting a phenomenon which came to be called "[[Egyptomania]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;Miles, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demands for restitution ===
A precedent for art repatriation was set in Roman antiquity when [[Cicero]] prosecuted [[Verres]], a senate member and illegal appropriator of art. Cicero's speech influenced [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] European thought and had an indirect impact on the modern debate about art repatriation.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero's argument uses military episodes of plunder as "case law" and expresses certain standards when it comes to appropriating cultural property of another people.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p.5&lt;/ref&gt; Cicero makes a distinction between public and private uses of art and what is appropriate for each and he also asserts that the primary purpose of art is religious expression and veneration. He also sets standards for the responsibilities of imperial administration abroad to the code of ethics surrounding the collection of art from defeated Greece and Rome in wartime. Later, both Napoleon and Lord Elgin would be likened to Verres in condemnations of their plundering of art.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wellington at Waterloo Hillingford.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The Allied victory in 1815 at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] marked the end of the Napoleonic Era.]]Art was repatriated for the first time in modern history when [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]] overturned art plundered by Napoleon to Italy after he and Marshal Bluchers armies defeated the French at the [[Battle of Waterloo]] in 1815.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; This decision contrasted sharply to a long-held tradition to the effect that "[[Spoils system|to the victors go the spoils]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; This is remarkable considering that in the battle of Waterloo alone, the financial and human costs were colossal; the decision to not only refrain from plundering France but to repatriate France's prior seizures from the Netherlands, Italy, Prussia, and Spain, was extraordinary.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the British paid for the restitution of the papal collection to Rome because the Pope could not finance the shipping himself.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; When British troops began packing up looted art from the Louvre, there was a public outcry in France. Crowds reportedly tried to prevent the taking of the [[Horses of Saint Mark]] and there were throngs of weeping ladies outside the Louvre Museum.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Miles, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the unprecedented nature of this repatriation effort, there are recent estimations that only about 55 percent of what was taken was actually repatriated: the Louvre Director at the time, [[Vivant Denon]], had sent out many important works to other parts of France before the British could take them.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;  Wellington viewed himself as representing all of Europe's nations and he believed that the moral decision would be to restore the art in its apparently proper context.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 332&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[Lord Castlereagh]] he wrote:

{{cquote|The Allies then, having the contents of the museum justly in their power, could not do otherwise than restore them to the countries form which, contrary to the practice of civilized warfare, they had been torn during the disastrous period of the French revolution and the tyranny of Bonaparte. ... Not only, then, would it, in my opinion, be unjust in the Sovereigns to gratify the people of France on this subject, at the expense of their own people, but the sacrifice they would make would be impolitic, as it would deprive them of the opportunity of giving the people of France a great moral lesson. |||Excerpt from letter of Wellington to Viscount Castlereagh, K.G., Paris| September 23, 1815&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;}}

Wellington also forbade pilfering among his troops as he believed that it led to the lack of discipline and distraction from military duty. He also held the view that winning support from local inhabitants was an important break from Napoleon's practices.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

The great public interest in art repatriation helped fuel the expansion of public museums in Europe and launched museum-funded archaeological explorations. The concept of art and cultural repatriation gained momentum through the latter decades of the twentieth century and began to show fruition by the end of the century when key works were ceded back to claimants.

== Legal issues ==

=== National government laws ===
In 1863 US President [[Abraham Lincoln]] summoned [[Francis Lieber]], a German-American jurist and political philosopher, to write a legal code to regulate Union soldiers' behavior toward Confederation prisoners, noncombatants, spies and property.  The resulting ''General Orders No.100'' or the [[Lieber Code]], legally recognized cultural property as a protected category in war.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 350&lt;/ref&gt;  The Lieber Code had far-reaching results as it became the basis for the Hague Convention of 1907 and 1954 and has led to Standing Rules of Engagement (ROE) for US troops today.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;Miles, p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;  A portion of the ROE clauses instruct US troops not to attack "schools, museums, national monuments, and any other historical or cultural sites unless they are being used for a military purpose and pose a threat".&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

In 2004 the US passed the Bill HR1047 for the Emergency Protection for Iraq Cultural Antiquities Act, which allows the President authority to impose emergency import restrictions by Section 204 of the Convention on Cultural Property Implementation Act (CCIPA).&lt;ref&gt;Miles, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Britain and Switzerland put into effect statutory prohibitions against illegally exported Iraqi artifacts.  In the UK, the Dealing in Cultural Objects Bill was established in 2003 that prohibited the handling of illegal cultural objects.

=== International conventions ===
The Hague Convention of 1907 aimed to forbid pillaging and sought to make wartime plunder the subject of legal proceedings, although in practice the defeated countries did not gain any leverage in their demands for repatriation.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1997"/&gt;  The Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict took place in the wake of widespread destruction of cultural heritage in [[World War II]] is the first international treaty of a worldwide vocation focusing exclusively on the protection of cultural heritage in the event of armed conflict.

The [[UNIDROIT]] (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law) Convention on Stolen or Illicitly Exported Cultural Objects of 1995 called for the return of illegally exported cultural objects &lt;ref&gt;http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/1995culturalproperty/1995culturalproperty-e.htm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326162020/http://www.unidroit.org/english/conventions/1995culturalproperty/1995culturalproperty-e.htm |date=March 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNESCO ===
The 1970 [[UNESCO]] Convention against Illicit Export under the Act to implement the Convention (the Cultural Property Implementation Act) allowed for stolen objects to be seized if there were documentation of it in a museum or institution of a state party and the following agreement in 1972 promoted world cultural and natural heritage&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1978 UNESCO Convention strengthened existing provisions; the Intergovernmental Committee for Promoting the Return of Cultural Property to its Countries of Origin or its Restitution in case of illicit Appropriation was established.  It consists of 22 members elected by the General Conference of UNESCO to facilitate bilateral negotiations for the restitution of "any cultural property which has a fundamental significance from the point of view of the spiritual values and cultural heritage of the people of a Member State or Associate Member of UNESCO and which has been lost as a result of colonial or foreign occupation or as a result of illicit appropriation".&lt;ref name="riviere2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Riviere|first=Francoise|title=Editorial|journal=Museum International, UNESCO Publishing and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|year=2009|volume=61|series=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also created to "encourage the necessary research and studies for the establishment of coherent programmes for the constitution of representative collections in countries whose cultural heritage has been dispersed".&lt;ref name="riviere2009"/&gt;

In response to the Iraqi National Museum looting, UNESCO Director-General, [[Kōichirō Matsuura]] convened a meeting in Paris on April 17, 2003 in order to assess the situation and coordinate international networks in order to recover the cultural heritage of Iraq.  On July 8, 2003, [[Interpol]] and UNESCO signed an amendment to their 1999 Cooperation Agreement in the effort to recover looted Iraqi artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bouchenaki|first=Mounir|title=Return and restitution of cultural property in the wake of the 1970 Convention|journal=Museum International, UNESCO Publishing and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|year=2009|volume=61|series=1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political issues ==

=== Colonialism and identity ===
From early on, the field of archaeology was deeply involved in political endeavors and in the construction of national identities. This early relationship can be seen during the [[Renaissance]] and the proto-Italian reactions against the [[High Gothic]] movement, but the relationship became stronger during 19th century Europe when archaeology became institutionalized as a field of study furnished by artifacts acquired during the rise of European colonialism led by the British and French.&lt;ref&gt;Silberman, pp. 249-50&lt;/ref&gt;  Colonialism and the field of archaeology mutually supported one another as the need to acquire knowledge of ancient artifacts justified further colonial dominance.

As further justification for colonial rule, the archaeological discoveries also shaped the way European colonialists identified with the artifacts and the ancient people who made them.  In the case of Egypt, colonial Europe's mission to bring the glory and magnificence of ancient Egypt closer to Europe and incorporate it into knowledge of world history, or better yet, European history placed ancient Egypt in a new spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;Said 86&lt;/ref&gt;  With the archaeological discoveries, ancient Egypt was adopted into the Western historical narrative and came to take on a significance that had up until that time been reserved for ancient Greek and Roman civilization.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Colla 103&lt;/ref&gt;  The French revolutionaries justified the large-scale and systematic looting of Italy in 1796 by viewing themselves as the political successors of Rome, in the same way that ancient Romans saw themselves as the heirs of Greek civilization;&lt;ref&gt;Miles 320&lt;/ref&gt; by the same token, the appropriation of ancient Egyptian history as European history further legitimated Western colonial rule over Egypt.  But while ancient Egypt became patrimony of the West, modern Egypt remained a part of the Muslim world.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  The writings of European archaeologists and tourists illustrate the impression that modern Egyptians were uncivilized, savage, and the antithesis of the splendor of ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Museums furnished by colonial looting have largely shaped the way a nation imagines its dominion, the nature of the human beings under its power, the geography of the land, and the legitimacy of its ancestors, working to suggest a process of political inheriting.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 164&lt;/ref&gt; It is necessary to understand the paradoxical way in which the objects on display at museums are tangible reminders of the power held by those who gaze at them.&lt;ref&gt;Colla 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Eliot Colla describes the structure of the Egyptian sculpture room in the British Museum as an assemblage that "form[s] an abstract image of the globe with London at the center".&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Colla 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[British Museum]], as Colla describes, presents a lesson of human development and progress:  "the forward march of human civilization from its classical origins in Greece and Rome, through Renaissance Italy, to modern-day London".&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;

The restoration of monuments was often made in colonial states to make natives feel as if in their current state, they were no longer capable of greatness.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;Anderson 181&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, sometimes colonial rulers argued that the ancestors of the colonized people did not make the artifacts.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Some scholars also argue that European colonialists used monumental archaeology and tourism to appear as the guardian of the colonized, reinforcing unconscious and undetectable ownership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Colonial rulers used peoples, religions, languages, artifacts, and monuments as source for reinforcing European nationalism, which was adopted and easily inherited from the colonial states.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt;

=== Nationalism and identity ===
As a direct reaction and resistance to colonial oppression, archaeology was also used for the purpose of legitimating the existence of an independent nation-state.&lt;ref&gt;Diaz-Andreu, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Egyptian Nationalists utilized its ancient history to invent the political and expressive culture of "[[Pharaonism]]" as a response to Europe’s "[[Egyptomania]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;Colla 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Masada02 ST 04.jpg|thumb|Masada fortress, Israel]]  Some argue that in colonized states, nationalist archaeology was used to resist colonialism and racism under the guise of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl, Fawcett, pp. 3-11&lt;/ref&gt;  While it is true that both colonialist and nationalist discourse use the artifact to form mechanisms to sustain their contending political agendas, there is a danger in viewing them interchangeably since the latter was a reaction and form of resistance to the former.  On the other hand, it is important to realize that in the process of emulating the mechanisms of colonial discourse, the nationalist discourse produced new forms of power.  In the case of the Egyptian nationalist movement, the new form of power and meaning that surrounded the artifact furthered the Egyptian independence cause but continued to oppress the rural Egyptian population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

Some scholars{{who|date=June 2015}} argue that archaeology can be a positive source of pride in cultural traditions, but can also be abused to justify cultural or racial superiority as the Nazis argued that Germanic people of Northern Europe was a distinct race and cradle of Western civilization that was superior to Jewish race.{{citation needed|reason=We need a source that substantiates the relationship between archaeology and the Nazi concept of Germanic racial superiority.|date=June 2015}} In some conflicts that involve land ownership, archaeology is used to encourage confrontation by means of constructing of national myth as seen with the ancient fortress of [[Masada]] in Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moss|first=Paul|title=Masada legend galvanizes Israel|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7830416.stm|accessdate=6 November 2010|newspaper=BBC|date=16 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases, archaeology allows rulers to justify the domination of neighboring peoples as [[Saddam Hussein]] used [[Mesopotamia]]'s magnificent past to justify his [[invasion of Kuwait]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Kohl, Fawcett, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars employ the idea that identity is fluid and constructed, especially national identity of modern nation-states, to argue that the post-colonial countries have no real claims to the artifacts plundered from their borders since their cultural connections to the artifacts are indirect and equivocal.&lt;ref&gt;Cuno, pp. xx-xxxvi&lt;/ref&gt; This argument asserts that artifacts should be viewed as universal cultural property and should not be divided among artificially created [[nation-states]]. Moreover, that encyclopedic museums are a testament to diversity, tolerance and the appreciation of many cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Cuno, pp. xxxv&lt;/ref&gt;  Other scholars would argue that this reasoning is a continuation of colonialist discourse attempting to appropriate the ancient art of colonized states and incorporate it into the narrative of Western history.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The debate surrounding art repatriation differs case by case due to the specific nature of legal and historical issues surrounding each case, but below are listed general arguments commonly used:

=== Arguments against repatriation ===
* Artifacts are a part of a universal human history and encyclopedic museums like the [[British Museum]], [[Musée du Louvre]] and [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] cultivate the dissemination of knowledge, tolerance, and broad cultural understanding.
* Artifacts were frequently excavated or uncovered by looters, who brought to light a piece of artwork that would otherwise never have been seen; foreign-led excavation teams have uncovered items that contribute to cultural knowledge and understanding.
* Nationalist retentionist cultural property laws claiming ownership are founded on constructed boundaries of modern nations with weak connections to the culture, spirit, and race to the ancient peoples who produced those antiquities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuno|first=James|title=Who Owns Antiquity? The Battle Over Our Ancient Heritage|year=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iipdigital.usembassy.gov/st/english/publication/2010/10/20101022140412aidan0.7519953.html#By_James_Cuno|title=Who’s Right? Repatriation of Cultural Property|first=James|last=Cuno|date=2 November 2010|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cultural identities are dynamic, inter-related and overlapping so no modern nation-state can claim cultural property as their own or else they are promoting a sectarian view of culture.
* Having artwork disseminated around the world encourages international scholarly and professional exchange.
* Encyclopedic museums are located in cosmopolitan cities such as London, Paris and New York, and if the artworks were to be moved, they would be seen by far fewer people. If the [[Rosetta Stone]] were to be moved from The British Museum to The [[Cairo Museum]], the number of people who view it would drop from about 5.5 million visitors to 2.5 million visitors a year.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/egypt/1436606/Egypt-demands-return-of-the-Rosetta-Stone.html Egypt demands return of the Rosetta Stone] The Telegraph. By Charlotte Edwardes and Catherine Milner, 20 Jul 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Arguments for repatriation ===
* Encyclopedic museums such as the [[British Museum]], [[Musée du Louvre]] and [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] were established as repositories for looted art during imperial and colonial rule, and thus are located in metropolitan cities out of view and reach of the cultures from which they were appropriated.
* Precedence of repatriated art has already been set in many cases but the artworks that museums currently refuse to repatriate are the most valuable and famous artworks.
* Foreign-led excavations have justified colonial rule; in the pursuit of obtaining knowledge about the artifacts, there was a need to establish control over the artifacts and the countries where they were located.
* The argument that art is a part of a universal human history is a derivative of colonial discourse that appropriated ancient art of other cultures into the Western historical narrative.
* The encyclopedic museums that house much of the world's artworks and artifacts are located in Western cities and privilege European scholars, professionals and people.
* The argument that artwork will not be protected outside of the Western world is hypocritical as much of the artwork transported out of colonized countries was crudely removed and damaged and sometimes lost in transportation. The [[Elgin marbles]] for example, were also damaged during the cleaning and "preservation" process.
* Art is best appreciated and understood in its  original historical and cultural context. Moreover the ''Napried'', one of the ships commissioned by [[Luigi Palma di Cesnola|di Cesnola]] to transport approximately 35,000 pieces of antiquities that he had collected from [[Cyprus]], was lost at sea carrying about 5,000 pieces in its cargo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://napried.com/|title=Napried Exploration|website=napried.com|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Art taken out of the country as a spoil of war, looting, imperialism, and colonialism is unethical, even if it isn't reflected in legislation.  The possession of artwork taken under these conditions is a form of continued colonialism.
* The lack of existing legal recourse for claiming the return of illicitly appropriated cultural property is a result of colonization.
* Cultural property is a symbol of cultural heritage and identity and the appropriation of historical artworks is an affront to a nation's pride.

== International examples ==
[[File:Nofretete Neues Museum.jpg|thumb|The iconic bust of Nefertiti]]

=== Egypt ===
Egypt is seeking the repatriation of the [[Rosetta Stone]] from the [[British Museum]] and the [[Nefertiti bust]] from the [[Neues Museum]] in Berlin.

=== Greece ===
Greece is seeking repatriation of the [[Elgin Marbles]] from the [[British Museum]], taken from the [[Parthenon]] by [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin]]. Since 1816, the [[British Museum]] has held the Parthenon Marbles ("In Britain, the acquisition of the collection was supported by some, while other critics compared The British Consul at Greece Elgin's actions to vandalism or looting", text from the Marbles article), and, despite the tortuous and ill explained path from Greece to England, the museum strongly defends its right to own and display the marbles.
[[File:Euphronios krater side A MET L.2006.10.jpg|thumb|Euphronios Krater]]

=== Italy ===
In February 2006, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] negotiated the repatriation of the [[Euphronios krater]] to [[Italy]], from where it was thought to have been looted in the early 1970s.

=== Canada ===
The [[Haisla people|Haisla]] [[totem Pole]] of [[Kitimat, British Columbia]] was originally prepared for chief G'psgoalux in 1872.  This aboriginal artifact was donated to a Swedish museum in 1929. According to the donor, he had purchased the pole from the [[Haisla people]] while he lived on the Canadian west coast and served as Swedish consul. After being approached by the Haisla people, the Swedish government decided in 1994 to return the pole, as the exact circumstances around the acquisition were unclear. The pole was returned to Kitimat in 2006 after a building had been constructed in order to preserve the pole.

=== India ===
The U.K. has rejected India's fresh demand to return its priceless artifacts like "[[Koh-i-Noor|Kohinoor Diamond]]" and "[[Sultanganj Buddha]]" that were stolen/looted/smuggled during British colonial rule citing a law (The British Museum Act, 1963) that prevents it from giving back the items. ASI (Archaeological Survey of India) is planning to join a campaign with the support of UNESCO and other countries to regain the artifacts.

=== South Korea ===
In November 2010, Japan agreed to return some 1,000 cultural objects to South Korea that were plundered during its colonial occupation from 1910-45. The collection includes a collection of royal books called [[Uigwe]] from the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392-1910).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tong|first=Xiong|title=S Korea to retrieve stolen cultural property from Japan: media|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/culture/2010-11/08/c_13596596.htm|accessdate=15 November 2010|newspaper=Xinhua News Agency|date=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
During an August 2005 diplomatic session in North Korea, former U.S. Ambassador to South Korea [[Donald Gregg]] received verbal indications from high-ranking North Korean officials that the state would be willing to repatriate the {{USS|Pueblo|AGER-2|6}} to United States authorities, on the condition that a prominent U.S. government official, such as the Secretary of State, come to Pyongyang for high level talks. While the U.S. government has publicly stated on several occasions that the return of the still commissioned Navy vessel is a priority, the current overall situation of U.S. and North Korean relations makes such an official state visit unlikely. Former Pueblo crew members William Thomas Massie, Dunnie Richard Tuck, Donald Raymond McClarren, and Lloyd Bucher sued the North Korean government for the abuse they suffered at its hands during their captivity. North Korea did not respond to the suit. In December 2008, U.S. District Judge [[Henry H. Kennedy, Jr.]] in Washington, D.C. awarded the plaintiffs $65 million in damages, describing their ill treatment by North Korea as "extensive and shocking." The plaintiffs, as of October 2009, were attempting to collect the judgment from North Korean assets frozen by the U.S. government.

Located in [[Washington, D.C.]], '''The School for Ethics and Global Leadership (SEGL)''' is a selective, [[semester]]-long residential program for intellectually motivated high school [[Eleventh grade|juniors]] from across the United States. The program selects students who have shown outstanding character, promise for leadership, and scholastic ability and provides them with a unique curriculum that emphasizes ethical thinking, leadership development, and international affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/independent_schools/2013/04/term-away_programs_a_sampler_of_independent_school_exotica.html?cmp=SOC-SHR-FB|title=Term-Away Programs: A Sampler of Independent School Exotica|first=Peter|last=Gow|website=Education Week - Independent Schools, Common Perspectives|access-date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

==History==
High school educator Noah Bopp founded SEGL in response to the September 11, 2001, attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Connell |first=Jonathan |title=School for Ethics and Global Leadership uses DC as a setting to teach ethics |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2009/02/02/story9.html |access-date=June 30, 2012 |newspaper=Washington Business Journal |date=January 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; SEGL matriculated its first class of students on August 29, 2009. Since its inception, the school has graduated over 500 students.

==School life==
Students at SEGL take courses based on a block schedule. Students take Ethics and Leadership for two hours on Monday, all day Wednesday, and for two hours on Friday. Other courses have regular 50-minute and longer block periods. All students also take an introductory Arabic and Chinese language and culture course. Along with the specialized SEGL curriculum, students take courses that match sending school requirements. The school also hosts a Summer Institute and offers several summer international excursions.

Visits with prominent guest speakers are common. Guests have included Supreme Court Justice [[Clarence Thomas]], General [[Stanley A. McChrystal]], [[Egil "Bud" Krogh]], [[Carl Wilkens]], [[Lissa Muscatine]], [[Jack Abramoff]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/at-this-school-you-could-get-a-lecture-on-political-ethics--from-jack-abramoff/2017/02/21/f1964808-de92-11e6-918c-99ede3c8cafa_story.html|title=At this school, you could get a lecture on political ethics — from Jack Abramoff|website=Washington Post|access-date=November 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ambassador [[Mark Dybul]], Senator [[Chuck Schumer]], former White House Press Secretary [[Mike McCurry (press secretary)|Mike McCurry]], NRA President [[David Keene]], Governor [[Michael Dukakis]], and former President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://schoolforethics.org/news/ |title=General Stanley McChrystal, Former White House Chief Of Staff Josh Bolton, And Former Ceo Robert Kamerschen Visit Segl For Blockbuster "Crisis Management" Week |deadurl=no |access-date=January 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Sociology}}
The '''sociology of culture''', and the related cultural sociology, concerns the systematic analysis of [[culture]], usually understood as the ensemble of symbolic codes used by a members of a society, as it is manifested in the society. For [[Georg Simmel]], culture referred to "the cultivation of individuals through the [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history". Culture in the sociological field is analyzed as the ways of thinking and describing, the ways of acting, and the material objects that together shape a people's way of life.

Contemporary sociologists' approach to culture is often divided between a "sociology of culture" and "cultural sociology"—the terms are similar, though not interchangeable.&lt;ref name="wordpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://orgtheory.wordpress.com/2006/08/27/the-sociology-of-culture-versus-cultural-sociology/|title=the sociology of culture versus cultural sociology &amp;#124; orgtheory.net|publisher=orgtheory.wordpress.com|accessdate=2014-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''sociology of culture'' is an older concept, and considers some topics and objects as more-or-less "cultural" than others. By way of contrast, [[Jeffrey C. Alexander]] introduced the term ''cultural sociology'', an approach that sees all, or most, [[Social phenomenon|social phenomena]] as inherently cultural at some level.&lt;ref name="umn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/edgell/culture/|title=Sociology of Culture and Cultural Sociology|publisher=blog.lib.umn.edu|accessdate=2014-10-01|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505182344/http://blog.lib.umn.edu/edgell/culture/|archivedate=2015-05-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a leading proponent of the "[[Strong programme|strong program]]" in cultural sociology, Alexander argues: "To believe in the possibility of cultural sociology is to subscribe to the idea that every action, no matter how instrumental, reflexive, or coerced [compared to] its external environment, is embedded to some extent in a horizon of [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] and [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]]."&lt;ref&gt;The Meanings of Social Life: A Cultural Sociology By Jeffrey C. Alexander https://books.google.com/books?id=CIA3AwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT10&amp;ots=csNoAH4xzN&amp;dq=%22cultural%20turn%22&amp;lr&amp;pg=PT18#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of analysis, sociology of culture often attempts to explain some discretely cultural phenomena as a product of social processes, while cultural sociology sees culture as a component of explanations of social phenomena.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultures and Societies in a Changing World|author1=Griswold, W.|author2=Carroll, C.|date=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9781412990547|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwQPS4H3aVcC}}&lt;/ref&gt; As opposed to the field of [[cultural studies]], cultural sociology does not reduce all human matters to a problem of cultural encoding and decoding. For instance, [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s cultural sociology has a "clear recognition of the social and the economic as categories which are interlinked with, but not reducible to, the cultural."&lt;ref&gt;Rojek, Chris, and Bryan Turner. "Decorative sociology: towards a critique of the cultural turn." The Sociological Review 48.4 (2000): 629-648.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

Cultural sociology first emerged in [[Weimar, Germany]], where sociologists such as [[Alfred Weber]] used the term ''Kultursoziologie'' (cultural sociology). Cultural sociology was then "reinvented" in the English-speaking world as a product of the "[[cultural turn]]" of the 1960s, which ushered in [[structuralism (sociology)|structuralist]] and [[postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] approaches to social science. This type of cultural sociology may loosely be regarded as an approach incorporating [[cultural analysis]] and [[critical theory]]. In the beginning of the cultural turn, sociologists tended to use qualitative methods and hermeneutic approaches to research, focusing on meanings, words, artifacts and symbols. "Culture" has since become an important concept across many branches of sociology, including historically quantitative and model-based subfields, such as [[social stratification]] and [[social network|social network analysis]].

===Early researchers===
The sociology of culture grew from the intersection between sociology, as shaped by early theorists like [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]], and with the growing discipline of [[anthropology]] where researchers pioneered [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] strategies for describing and analyzing a variety of cultures around the world. Part of the legacy of the early development of the field is still felt in the methods (much of cultural sociological research is qualitative) in the theories (a variety of critical approaches to sociology are central to current research communities) and substantive focus of the field. For instance, relationships between [[popular culture]], political control, and [[social class]] were early and lasting concerns in the field.

====Karl Marx====
{{Main|Karl Marx}}
As a major contributor to [[conflict theory]], Marx argued that culture served to justify inequality. The ruling class, or the [[bourgeoisie]], produce a culture that promotes their interests, while repressing the interests of the [[proletariat]]. His most famous line to this effect is that "Religion is the [[opium of the people]]". Marx believed that the "engine of history" was the struggle between groups of people with diverging economic interests and thus the economy determined the cultural [[Base and superstructure|superstructure]] of [[values]] and [[ideologies]]. For this reason, Marx is a considered a ''[[materialist]]'' as he believes that the economic (material) produces the cultural (ideal), which "stands [[Hegel]] on his head,"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyu.edu/classes/jackson/calhoun.jackson.theory/papers/A--MarxGeneral.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; who argued the ideal produced the material.

====Émile Durkheim====
{{Main|Émile Durkheim}}
Durkheim held the belief that culture has many relationships to society which include:
* ''Logical'' – Power over individuals belongs to certain cultural categories, and beliefs such as in God.
* ''Functional –'' Certain rites and myths create and build up social order by having more people create strong beliefs. The greater the number of people who believe strongly in these myths more will the social order be strengthened.
* ''Historical –'' Culture had its origins in society, and from those experiences came evolution into things such as classification systems.

====Max Weber====
{{Main|Max Weber}}
Weber innovated the idea of a [[status group]] as a certain type of subculture. Status groups are based on things such as: race, ethnicity, religion, region, occupation, gender, sexual preference, etc. These groups live a certain lifestyle based on different values and norms. They are a culture within a culture, hence the label subculture. Weber also purported the idea that people were motivated by their material and ideal interests, which include things such as preventing one from going to hell. Weber also explains that people use symbols to express their spirituality, that symbols are used to express the spiritual side of real events, and that ideal interests are derived from symbols.

====Georg Simmel====
{{Main|Georg Simmel}}
For Simmel, culture refers to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history."&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Donald (ed) 'Simmel: On individuality and social forms' Chicago University Press, 1971. pxix.&lt;/ref&gt; Simmel presented his analyses within a context of "form" and "content". Sociological concept and analysis can be viewed.

==The elements of culture==
'''1. Symbols:''' Any thing that carries particular meaning recognized by people who share the same culture.&lt;ref name=gerber&gt;{{cite book|authors=Gerber, John J., and Linda M. Macionis |title=Sociology|publisher=Pearson Canada|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|pages=59–65|edition=7th Canadian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2. Language:''' A system of symbols that allows people to communicate with one another.&lt;ref name=gerber /&gt;

'''3. Values:''' Culturally defined standards of desirability, goodness, beauty and many other things that serves as broad guidelines for social living.&lt;ref name=gerber /&gt;

'''4. Beliefs:''' Specific statements that people hold to be true.&lt;ref name=gerber /&gt;

'''5. [[Social norm|Norms]]:''' Rules and expectations by which a society guides the behaviour of its members. The two types of norms are mores and folkways. '''[[Mores]]''' are norms that are widely observed and have a great moral significance. '''Folkways''' are norms for routine, casual interaction.&lt;ref name=gerber /&gt;

'''6. Behavioral patterns:''' The typical manner in which people perform production (e.g., manual, manufactured, automated in various degrees), communicate (e.g., language content, technology choices), mark significant events (e.g., rituals of endorsing values and of punctuating steps in personal life), satisfy basic needs (e.g., for dwelling, feeding, security, sex, reproduction, entertainment), and the like.

'''7. Artifacts:''' Distinct material objects, such as architecture, technologies, and artistic creations.

'''8.  Social institutions:''' Patterns of organization and relationships regarding governance, production, socializing, education, knowledge creation, arts, and relating to other cultures.

==Anthropology==
In an anthropological sense, culture is society based on the values and ideas without influence of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;Radcliffe-Brown&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=The cultural system is the cognitive and symbolic matrix for the central values system|sign=[[Talcott Parsons]]|source=}}

Culture is like the shell of a lobster. Human nature is the organism living inside of that shell. The shell, culture, identifies the organism, or human nature. Culture is what sets human nature apart, and helps direct the life of human nature.

[[Anthropology|Anthropologists]] lay claim to the establishment of modern uses of the culture concept as defined by [[Edward Burnett Tylor]] in the mid-19th century.

===Bronisław Malinowski===
{{Main|Bronisław Malinowski}}
Malinowski collected data from the [[Trobriand Islands]]. Descent groups across the island claim parts of the land, and to back up those claims, they tell myths of how an ancestress started a clan and how the clan descends from that ancestress. Malinowski's observations followed the research of that found by Durkheim.

===Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown===
{{Main|Alfred Reginald Radcliffe-Brown}}
Radcliffe-Brown put himself in the culture of the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman Islanders]]. His research showed that group solidification among the islanders is based on music and kinship, and the rituals that involve the use of those activities. In the words of Radcliffe-Brown, "Ritual fortifies Society".

===Marcel Mauss===
{{Main|Marcel Mauss}}
Marcel Mauss made many comparative studies on religion, magic, law and morality of occidental and non-occidental societies, and developed the concept of [[total social fact]], and argued that the reciprocity is the universal logic of the cultural interaction.

===Claude Lévi-Strauss===
{{Main|Claude Lévi-Strauss}}
Lévi-Strauss, based, at the same time, on the sociological and anthropological [[positivism]] of Durkheim, Mauss, Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown, on the economic and sociological [[marxism]], on [[freudian]] and [[Gestalt psychology]] and on [[structural linguistics]] of Saussure and Jakobson, realized great studies on areas myth, kinship, religion, ritual, symbolism, magic, [[ideology]] (souvage pensée), knowledge, art and aesthetics, applying the [[methodological structuralism]] on his investigations. He searched the universal principals of human thought as a form of explaining social behaviors and structures.

==Major areas of research==

===Theoretical constructs in Bourdieu's sociology of culture===
French sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s influential model of society and social relations has its roots in [[Marxist theorists|Marxist theories]] of [[Marxian class theory|class]] and [[Social conflict theory|conflict]]. Bourdieu characterizes social relations in the context of what he calls the ''[[Field (Bourdieu)|field]]'', defined as a competitive system of social relations functioning according to its own specific logic or rules. The ''field'' is the site of struggle for power between the dominant and subordinate classes. It is within the ''field'' that [[Legitimacy (criminal law)|legitimacy]]—a key aspect defining the dominant class—is conferred or withdrawn.

Bourdieu's theory of practice is practical rather than [[Discursive psychology|discursive]], embodied as well as cognitive and durable though adaptive. A valid concern that sets the agenda in Bourdieu's [[Practice theory|theory of practice]] is how action follows regular statistical patterns without the product of accordance to rules, norms and/or conscious intention. To explain this concern, Bourdieu explains [[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]] and [[field (Bourdieu)|field]]. Habitus explains the mutually penetrating realities of individual subjectivity and societal objectivity after the function of social construction. It is employed to transcend the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] and [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] dichotomy.

===Cultural change===
{{Further|Trans-cultural diffusion}}
The belief that culture is symbolically coded and can thus be taught from one person to another means that cultures, although bounded, can change. Cultures are both predisposed to change and resistant to it. [[Resistance (psychoanalysis)|Resistance]] can come from habit, religion, and the integration and interdependence of cultural traits.

[[Culture change|Cultural change]] can have many causes, including: the environment, inventions, and contact with other cultures.

Several understandings of how cultures change come from anthropology. For instance, in diffusion theory, the form of something moves from one culture to another, but not its meaning. For example, the [[Ankh|ankh symbol]] originated in [[Culture of Egypt|Egyptian culture]] but has diffused to numerous cultures. Its original meaning may have been lost, but it is now used by many practitioners of [[New Age religion]] as an arcane symbol of power or life forces. A variant of the diffusion theory, [[stimulus diffusion]], refers to an element of one culture leading to an invention in another.

Contact between cultures can also result in [[acculturation]]. Acculturation has different meanings, but in this context refers to replacement of the traits of one culture with those of another, such as what happened with many [[Native American Indians]]. Related processes on an individual level are [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]] and [[transculturation]], both of which refer to adoption of a different culture by an individual.

Griswold outlined another sociological approach to cultural change. Griswold points out that it may seem as though culture comes from individuals – which, for certain elements of cultural change, is true – but there is also the larger, collective, and long-lasting culture that cannot have been the creation of single individuals as it predates and post-dates individual humans and contributors to culture. The author presents a [[sociological perspective]] to address this conflict.

Sociology suggests an alternative to both the view that it has always been an unsatisfying way  at one extreme and the sociological individual genius view at the other. This alternative posits that culture and cultural works are collective, not individual, creations. We can best understand specific cultural objects... by seeing them not as unique to their creators but as the fruits of collective production, fundamentally social in their genesis. (p.&amp;nbsp;53)
In short, Griswold argues that culture changes through the contextually dependent and socially situated actions of individuals; macro-level culture influences the individual who, in turn, can influence that same culture. The logic is a bit circular, but illustrates how culture can change over time yet remain somewhat constant.

It is, of course, important to recognize here that Griswold is talking about cultural change and not the actual origins of culture (as in, "there was no culture and then, suddenly, there was"). Because Griswold does not explicitly distinguish between the origins of cultural change and the origins of culture, it may appear as though Griswold is arguing here for the origins of culture and situating these origins in society. This is neither accurate nor a clear representation of sociological thought on this issue. Culture, just like society, has existed since the beginning of humanity (humans being social and cultural). Society and culture co-exist because humans have social relations and meanings tied to those relations (e.g. brother, lover, friend). Culture as a super-phenomenon has no real beginning except in the sense that humans (homo sapiens) have a beginning. This, then, makes the question of the origins of culture moot – it has existed as long as we have, and will likely exist as long as we do. Cultural change, on the other hand, is a matter that can be questioned and researched, as Griswold does.

===Culture theory===
[[Culture theory]], developed in the 1980s and 1990s, sees audiences as playing an active rather than passive role in relation to mass media. One strand of research focuses on the audiences and how they interact with media; the other strand of research focuses on those who produce the media, particularly the news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cliffsnotes.com:80/study_guide/topicArticleId-26957,articleId-26946.html|title=The Role and Influence of Mass Media|last=|first=|date=|website=Cliffs Notes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821005211/http://www.cliffsnotes.com:80/study_guide/topicArticleId-26957,articleId-26946.html|archive-date=22 September 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computer-mediated communication as culture===
{{Main|Computer-mediated communication}}

Computer-mediated communication (CMC) is the process of sending messages—primarily, but not limited to text messages—through the direct use by participants of computers and communication networks. By restricting the definition to the direct use of computers in the communication process, you have to get rid of the communication technologies that rely upon computers for switching technology (such as telephony or compressed video), but do not require the users to interact directly with the computer system via a keyboard or similar computer interface. To be mediated by computers in the sense of this project, the communication must be done by participants fully aware of their interaction with the computer technology in the process of creating and delivering messages. Given the current state of computer communications and networks, this limits CMC to primarily text-based messaging, while leaving the possibility of incorporating sound, graphics, and video images as the technology becomes more sophisticated.

===Cultural institutions===
{{Main|Cultural Institutions Studies}}
Cultural activities are institutionalised; the focus on institutional settings leads to the investigation "of activities in the cultural sector, conceived as historically evolved societal forms of organising the conception, production, distribution, propagation, interpretation, reception, conservation and maintenance of specific cultural goods".&lt;ref&gt;Zembylas, Tasos (2004): Kulturbetriebslehre. Begründung einer Inter-Disziplin. Wiesbaden: VS-Verlag für Sozialwissenschaften, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural Institutions Studies is therefore a specific approach within the sociology of culture.

'''Solemyidae''' is a [[family (biology)|family]] of saltwater clams, [[marine (ocean)|marine]] protobranch [[bivalve]] [[mollusk]]s in the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Solemyoida]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur William Baden Powell|Powell A. W. B.]], ''New Zealand Mollusca'', [[HarperCollins|William Collins Publishers Ltd]], Auckland, New Zealand (1979) {{ISBN|0-00-216906-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
Solemyids are remarkable in that their digestive tract is either extremely small or non-existent, and their feeding appendages are too short to reach outside the shell.&lt;ref&gt;Reid R. G. B. (1989) The unwhole organism. [http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/29/3/1133/ American Zoologist 29:1133-1140]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been shown that these clams host [[sulphur]]-[[oxidizing]] [[bacteria]] intracellularly within their [[gill]] filaments. As [[chemoautotrophs]], these bacterial [[symbionts]] synthesize organic matter from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and are the primary source of nutrition for the whole organism.&lt;ref&gt;Cavanaugh C. M., Abbott M. S., Veenhuis M. (1988) Immunochemical localization of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase in the symbiont-containing gills of Solemya velum (Bivalvia, Mollusca). [http://www.pnas.org/content/85/20/7786 PNAS 85:7786–7789]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stewart F. J., Cavanaugh, C. M. (2006) Bacterial endosymbioses in Solemya (Mollusca: Bivalvia) – Model systems for studies of symbiont-host adaptation. [http://springerlink.com/content/e24615311h534725/ Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 90: 343-360] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130202220900/http://springerlink.com/content/e24615311h534725/ |date=2013-02-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In turn, the animal host provides its symbionts a habitat in which they have access to the substrates of chemoautotrophy (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and reduced inorganic compounds such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S). Together, these partners create "animals" with novel metabolic capabilities.

In [[fiction]], a '''subplot''' is a secondary strand of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]]  that is a supporting side story for any story or the main plot. Subplots may connect to main plots, in either time and place or in thematic significance. Subplots often involve supporting characters, those besides the [[protagonist]] or [[antagonist]]. Subplots may also intertwine with the main plot at some point in a story.

Subplots are distinguished from the main plot by taking up less of the action, having fewer significant events occur, with less impact on the "world" of the work, and occurring to less important characters.  

In [[screenwriting]], a subplot is referred to as a "B story" or a "C story," etc.

'''''Technology and Culture''''' is a quarterly [[academic journal]] founded in 1959. It is an official publication of the [[Society for the History of Technology]] (SHOT), whose members routinely refer to it as "T&amp;C." Besides scholarly articles and critical essays, the journal publishes reviews of books and museum exhibitions. Occasionally, the journal publishes thematic issues; topics have included patents, gender and technology, and ecology. ''Technology and Culture'' has had three past [[editors-in-chief]]: [[Melvin Kranzberg]] (1959–1981), Robert C. Post (1982–1995), and John M. Staudenmaier (1996–2010). Since 2011 the journal has been edited at the [[University of Oklahoma]] by Prof. Suzanne Moon. Managing editors have included Joan Mentzer, Joseph M. Schultz, David M. Lucsko, and Peter Soppelsa.

In its inaugural issue, editor Melvin Kranzberg set out a threefold educational mission for the journal: "to promote the scholarly study of the history of technology, to show the relations between technology and other elements of culture, and to make these elements of knowledge available and comprehensible to the educated citizen." No journal then in existence had as its primary focus the history of technology and its relations with society and culture. To adequately address these topics in all their complexity, a truly interdisciplinary approach was needed. And this was to be the unique contribution of ''Technology and Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kranzberg|first=Melvin|title=At the Start|journal=Technology and Culture|date=Winter 1959|volume=1|issue=1|pages=9 https://www.jstor.org/stable/3100782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3094">'''The Science of Aliens''' is a touring exhibition that launched at the [[Science Museum (London)|London Science Museum]] in October 2005. It was developed by a company called [[The Science of...]] set up by The Science Museum and Fleming Media. Two versions of the exhibition are touring venues around the world.

==Exhibition content==
The Science of Aliens asks the question "are we alone in the Universe?" through a combination through the artifacts, interactive and audiovisual exhibits. The exhibition has an introduction section looking at science fiction archetypes before going on to look at what scientists can tell us about the real possibilities for alien life. The second section explores the variety of life on Earth and the extreme conditions in which it can survive. It looks at recent missions to moons and planets in the [[Solar System]] and what they can tell us about alien life before going on to examine some extra-solar planets.

The next section presents two fictional planets, [[Extraterrestrial (TV program)|Aurelia and Blue Moon]] and their ecosystems as imagined by scientists. These are used to explore the factors and parameters governing life on other planets and are presented as two large interactive landscapes.

The exhibition concludes by looking at the chances of communication with alien intelligence. This includes a look at the efforts of SETI and various messages sent out by humans into the Universe and a chance for visitors to compose a message to extraterrestrial intelligence. The Science of Aliens was also made into a best selling book by Jack Challoner.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1557919,00.html They're aliens ... but not as we know them | Science | The Observer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigwavetv.com/programs/alienworlds.html Big Wave/Programs/Alien Worlds&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828185441/http://www.bigwavetv.com/programs/alienworlds.html |date=2009-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artcom.de/en/projects/project/detail/the-science-of-aliens/ ART+COM - The Science of Aliens&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620042243/http://www.artcom.de/en/projects/project/detail/the-science-of-aliens/ |date=2013-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Transparency of media ownership in Europe}}

[[Transparency of media ownership in Europe|Transparency of media ownership]] refers to the public availability of accurate, comprehensive and up-to-date information about media ownership structures to make possible for media authorities and the wider public to ascertain who effectively owns and controls the media. In [[Romania]] transparency of media ownership is addressed directly in the Constitution and is regulated by a media-specific law, namely the Audiovisual Law no. 504, and by national company law. As for constitutional provisions, even if [[Romania]] is among the few European countries that addresses the issue of media transparency directly in the Constitution, it should be said that the focus is on transparency of financial sources and not on ownership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/18780552/Craufurd_Smith_Stolte_Transparency_of_Media_Ownership_in_the_EU_24sep2014.pdf Rachel Craufurd and Yolande Stolte, The transparency of media ownership in the European Union and Neighbouring States, Access-Info, Open Society Program on Independent Journalism, September 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, despite the constitutional provisions on the right to impose an obligation on the media to make public their sources of finance, the Parliament has never enacted the applicable legislation which is indeed absent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/18780552/Craufurd_Smith_Stolte_Transparency_of_Media_Ownership_in_the_EU_24sep2014.pdf Rachel Craufurd and Yolande Stolte, The transparency of media ownership in the European Union and Neighbouring States, Access-Info, Open Society Program on Independent Journalism, September 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanian media-specific law requiring the disclosure of media ownership information applies only to the broadcast sector and provides the disclosure to both a public authority, namely the [[National Audiovisual Council]] (CNA) and directly to the public. Finally, also the national company law contains provisions regulating transparency of media ownership. It applies to all media which are registered companies and foresees the obligation to publish all the most relevant information on companies' ownership in the [[Trade Register Company]]. Overall, even though the Romanian legislation in the field of media ownership transparency is fully aligned with the European standards, in practice sufficient information to assess who effectively owns and ultimately controls the media is not always available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal framework==

===Media-specific law: disclosure to a public authority===

Romanian law on media ownership transparency only covers the broadcast sector and has no similar provision for print media, but, in practice, many Romanian newspapers make public their publishers and owners. The situation is more complicated for online media and blogs where anonymity is very common.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irex.org/sites/default/files/pdf/media-sustainability-index-europe-eurasia-2016-romania.pdf.pdf IREX 2016, Europe &amp; Eurasia Media Sustainability Index 2016: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relevant law, named [[Audiovisual Law no. 504]], requires the disclosure of all the information necessary to identify the owners of media companies, e.g. name and contact details of the media organisation; name and contact detail of owners; country of domicile of company with an interest; citizenship / residence status of individual with an interest beyond a given threshold. However, the disclosure requirement does not apply to [[beneficial ownership]], which refers to shares of a media company hold on behalf of another person. According to the law, the information must be reported to the [[National Audiovisual Council]], a public regulatory authority under the control of the Parliament. The CNA is the guarantor of the public interest in the audiovisual field.

One of the main problem of the law concerns indirect interest: threshold for disclosing indirect interest, which is 20%, looks too high to provide proper information for assessing media ownership and guaranteeing transparency. Furthermore, getting information on individuals or companies with indirect control or significant interests in a given media company is quite time-consuming and complex as it requires in practice a step-by-step process of checking and cross-referencing of a large number of different records.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to constraints or costs for public access to the information held by the [[National Audiovisual Council]] there are not particularly high costs or time-consuming procedures, even if, in general terms, accessing information held by public institutions often entails several barriers, such as the reluctance of public officials to reveal sensitive information and their resort to broad interpretations of the exceptions to public disclosure of information.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the legal framework provides the disclosure of nearly all the information needed to identify ownership of the broadcast media in Romania. However, the threshold for reporting indirect interest (20%), the difficulties in obtaining information on entities or persons with indirect control and significant interest, abuses and poor implementation, the lack of co-operation between the CNA and other authorities leave room to abuses and insufficient disclosure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media-specific law: disclosure directly to the public===

According to Article. 48 of Law 504 of 2002, media companies from the audiovisual field must also disclose the information on media ownership directly to the public through their websites. The requirement applies to all kind of information to be disclosed in accordance with the law. In particular, financial information must be updated and disclosed on an annual basis, while the other information must be always available to the public (requirement of the “permanent access” by the public, according to Article 48).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-media specific transparency requirements: company law ===

In addition to the Audiovisual Law, another source of regulation for transparency of media ownership in Romania is [[Corporate law|company law]] which contains non-media specific transparency requirements. The relevant law, which is the Law 31 / 1990 on Trading Companies is applicable to all registered media company owing a licence and forbids owners' anonymity: companies are therefore obliged to publish all the main information on ownership in the [[Trade Register Office]] (TRO) and to communicate changes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; All the constitutive deeds and the modifications are registered in the Trade Registry and published in the Official Journal. The specific information to be disclosed depends on the legal type of the company and might be different for each type of business organisations. However, the mandatory information for all companies are: names, the date and the place of birth, the address and the citizenship of the partners / shareholders (in case of natural persons); the name, the headquarter address and the nationality of the associates (in case of legal persons); the type, name, headquarters address and the company logo; the company’s field of activity; the registered capital, including the contribution of each partner in cash or in kind; the number and the face value of the shares and the number of shares given to each partners; the managers of the company and their rights; the share given to each associate in case of profit and loss; secondary headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The public can directly access this data by requesting information from the Trade Registry. Also, since the constitutive documents are also published in the Official Journal, the public can consult this information through the institutional website of the Journal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if the law requires the disclosure of all necessary information on ownership, in fact this data have to be reported to various agencies. This might imply, for instance, a complicated step-by-step check process involving request for information from different agencies for each company in the cases of chains of ownership, such as companies owning other companies and the like.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/162195917/TMO-Romania Access-Info Europe, Transparency of media ownership – The legal framework: Romania. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, as there are minimal financial sanctions for failure to report in time, in practice few companies comply with the obligation to update ownership information.

According to some critics, the Trade Register Office only shows the tip of the iceberg since the real owner of the media and who effectively controls them remain hidden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.mirovni-institut.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/media-ownership-and-its-impact-on-media-independence-and-pluralism.pdf Manuela Proteasa, 2004, "Romania" in Media ownership and its impact on media independence and pluralism / &amp;#91;editor Brankica Petković&amp;#93;. Ljubljana : Peace Institute, Institute for Contemporary Social and Political Studies. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, although public, the access to information collected in the Register is not free of charge and can even be prohibitive.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these limits, the TRO remains the main source of data on media ownership in Romania&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.mirovni-institut.si/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/media-ownership-and-its-impact-on-media-independence-and-pluralism.pdf Manuela Proteasa, 2004, "Romania" in Media ownership and its impact on media independence and pluralism / &amp;#91;editor Brankica Petković&amp;#93;. Ljubljana : Peace Institute, Institute for Contemporary Social and Political Studies. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; and even if the learning process might be time-consuming, especially in the most complex cases of unclear ownership, all in all it is feasible given sufficient time and resources to collect all the needed information, including [[beneficial ownership]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.access-info.org/tmo/12165 Access-Info, Romania TMO Consultation. Retrieved October 6, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transparency of media ownership in practice==

Despite the fact that Romanian legislation in the field of media ownership transparency is formally aligned with the European standards (both the [[European Commission]] and the [[Council of Europe]] standards are incorporated in the national legal framework), in practice, there are some major problems. Among the main shortcomings there is the absence of the requirement to disclose all the necessary data to establish which are the owners in case of indirect control or having significant interests in the media company. Moreover, at the practical level, the implementation of the law leaves room for abuses and inadequate disclosure. In sum, a set of factors, including the difficulty in ascertain indirect control and significant interest, implementation problems as well as the challenges in accessing public information result in a significant difficulty for the general public in accessing all the key information to establish who effectively owns and ultimately controls a media outlet.

Women have engaged in [[philosophy]] throughout the field's history. While there were women [[philosopher]]s since ancient times, and a relatively small number were accepted as philosophers during the [[ancient philosophy|ancient]], [[Medieval philosophy|medieval]], [[Modern philosophy|modern]] and [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary]] eras, particularly during the 20th and 21st century, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"&gt;Duran, Jane. Eight women philosophers: theory, politics, and feminism.

In [[ancient philosophy]] in the West, while academic philosophy was typically the domain of male philosophers such as [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], female philosophers such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC) were active during this period. Notable [[medieval philosophy|medieval philosophers]] include [[Hypatia]] (5th century), [[St. Hildegard of Bingen]] (1098-1179) and [[St. Catherine of Sienna]] (1347-1380). Notable [[Modern philosophy|modern philosophers]] included [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) and [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850). Influential [[Contemporary philosophy|contemporary philosophers]] include [[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985), [[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986), [[Mary Midgley]] (born 1919), [[Mary Warnock]] (born 1924), [[Julia Kristeva]] (born 1941), [[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) and [[Susan Haack]] (born 1945).

In the early 1800s, some colleges and universities in the UK and US began [[Mixed-sex education#Higher-education institutions|admitting women]], giving rise to new generations of female academics. Nevertheless, [[U.S. Department of Education]] reports from the 1990s indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"&gt;"Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities."National Center for Education Statistics, Statistical Analysis Report, March 2000; U.S. Department of Education, Office of Education Research and Improvement, Report # NCES 2000–173;1993 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty (NSOPF:93).

In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that there is gender imbalance and [[gender bias]] in the academic field of philosophy.&lt;ref name="nas.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nas.org/articles/women_in_philosophy_problems_with_the_discrimination_hypothesis|title=Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis - National Association of Scholars|author=|date=|website=www.nas.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2013, a US sociology professor stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers, and they require editors and writers to ensure they represent the contributions of women philosophers.&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; According to Eugene Sun Park, "[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male. This homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline."&lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"/&gt; Susan Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that...still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/05/reviving-the-female-canon/393110/|title=Reviving the Female Canon|first=Susan|last=Price|date=13 May 2015|website=theatlantic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Saul, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the [[humanities]], is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;

==Representation and working climate==
[[File:Martha Nussbaum wikipedia 10-10.jpg|thumb|right|200px|American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people6/Nussbaum/nussbaum-con1.html|title=Conversation with Martha C. Nussbaum, p. 1 of 6|work=berkeley.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
In the early 1990s, the [[Canadian Philosophical Association]] claimed that "...there is compelling evidence" of "...philosophy’s gender imbalance" and "bias and partiality in many of its theoretical products." In 1992, the association recommended that "fifty percent of [philosophy]...positions should be filled by women.”&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; In a 2008 article “Changing the Ideology and Culture of Philosophy: Not by Reason (Alone),” MIT philosophy professor [[Sally Haslanger]] stated that the top twenty graduate programs in philosophy in the US have from 4 percent to 36 percent women faculty.&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; In June 2013, Duke University professor of sociology Kieran Healy stated that "out of all recent citations in four prestigious philosophy journals, female authors comprise just 3.6 percent of the total." The editors of the [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] have raised concerns about the underrepresentation of women philosophers; as such, the encyclopedia “encourage[s] [their] authors, subject editors, and referees to help ensure that SEP entries do not overlook the work of women or indeed of members of underrepresented groups more generally.”&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt;

In 2014, philosophy professors Neven Sesardic and Rafael De Clercq published an article entitled "Women in Philosophy: Problems with the Discrimination Hypothesis." The article states that a "...number of philosophers attribute the underrepresentation of women in philosophy largely to [[gender bias|bias against women]] or some kind of wrongful [[discrimination]]". Evidence cited includes "gender disparities that increase along the path from undergraduate student to full-time faculty member"; "anecdotal accounts of discrimination in philosophy"; "research on gender bias in the evaluation of manuscripts, grants, and curricula vitae in other academic disciplines"; "psychological research on implicit bias"; "psychological research on [[stereotype threat]]" and the "...relatively small number of articles written from a feminist perspective in leading philosophy journals".&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt; Sesardic and De Clercq argue that "proponents of the discrimination hypothesis, who include distinguished philosophers ...have tended to present evidence selectively."&lt;ref name="nas.org"/&gt;

American philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]] stated in 2008 that "...it is very hard to find a place in philosophy that isn’t actively hostile towards women and minorities, or at least assumes that a successful philosopher should look and act like a (traditional, white) man.”&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/25/philosphy-women-warnock-baggini-debate|title=Does philosophy have a problem with women?|first1=Mary|last1=Warnock|first2=Julian|last2=Baggini|date=25 July 2015|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haslanger states that she experienced “occasions when a woman’s status in graduate school was questioned because she was married, or had a child (or had taken time off to have a child so was returning to philosophy as a ‘mature’ student), or was in a long-distance relationship". American philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]], who completed a PhD in philosophy at [[Harvard University]] in 1975, alleges that she encountered a tremendous amount of discrimination during her studies at Harvard, including sexual harassment and problems getting childcare for her daughter.&lt;ref name="berkeley.edu"/&gt;

In July 2015, British philosopher [[Mary Warnock]] addressed the issue of the representation of women in British university philosophy departments, where 25% of faculty are women. Warnock stated she is "... against intervention, by [[Hiring quota|quota]]s or otherwise, to increase women’s chances of employment" in philosophy.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; She also argues that "... there is nothing intrinsically harmful about this imbalance" and she states that she does not "...believe it shows a conscious bias against women." &lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; Philosopher [[Julian Baggini]] states that he believes that there is "...little or no conscious discrimination against women in philosophy". At the same time, Baggini states that there may be a "...great deal of unconscious bias" against women in philosophy, because philosophy generally does not address issues of gender or ethnicity.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt;

===Allegations of sexual harassment===
In 2014, ''[[Inside Higher Education]]'' described the philosophy "...discipline’s own long history of misogyny and sexual harassment."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; On March 28, 2011, the blog ''New APPS'' published a post examining the allegations of persistent [[sexual harassment]] faced by women professors in philosophy, due largely to "serial harassers" continuing to work in the field despite widespread knowledge of their actions. The post proposed that, since institutional procedures seemed to have been ineffective at removing or punishing harassers, philosophers should socially shun known offenders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/03/what-is-to-be-done-about-sexual-harassment-in-the-philosophy-profession.html What is to be done about sexual harassment in the philosophy profession? – New APPS: Art, Politics, Philosophy, Science].

According to Heidi Lockwood, an associate professor of philosophy at [[Southern Connecticut State University]], there is a "...power “asymmetry” between professors and students – even graduate students"; as well, she noted that "...even when colleges and universities have blanket prohibitions against professor-student sexual relationships, as does Yale,...institution-specific policies leave students vulnerable [to sexual advances from faculty] at conferences."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
 
According to an August 2013 article in ''Salon'', a tenured male University of Miami philosopher resigned after allegedly "...sending emails to a [female] student in which he suggested that they have sex three times."&lt;ref name="salon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2013/08/15/philosophy_has_a_sexual_harassment_problem/|title=Philosophy has a sexual harassment problem|author=|date=15 August 2013|website=salon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Sheffield]], set up a blog for women philosophers in 2010. She received numerous allegations of [[sexual harassment]] by male philosophy faculty, including a "job candidate who said she was sexually assaulted at the annual APA meeting where job interviews take place", an "undergraduate whose professor joked publicly about dripping hot wax on her nipples" and a "... lesbian who found herself suddenly invited, after she came out, to join in the sexualizing of her female colleagues." Saul states that philosophy departments failed to deal with the allegations.&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt; In 2013, the [[American Philosophical Association]] formed a committee to study the allegations of sexual harassment of women students and professors by male philosophy faculty.&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt; Saul states that one of the allegations was regarding a "...distinguished visiting speaker whose first words are: “Show me a grad student I can fuck”." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Saul states that women are "...leaving philosophy after being harassed, assaulted, or retaliated against." &lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; In 2014, ''Inside Higher Education'' reported allegations that a [[Yale University]] philosophy professor had sexually harassed a woman; the "alleged victim says she reported the professor to Yale, with no real result".&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;
In an interview with ''Inside Higher Ed'', the alleged victim stated that she "...suffers from [[post-traumatic stress disorder]] that impedes everyday life, not only from the alleged attack but also from the “browbeating” she endured as she attempted to report the professor, again and again, to Yale officials."&lt;ref name="insidehighered.com"/&gt;

In 1993, the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s sexual harassment committee set out guidelines for addressing this issue in philosophy departments. The APA guidelines, which were revised in 2013, stated that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apaonline.org/?harassment|title=Statement on Sexual Harassment - The American Philosophical Association|author=|date=|website=www.apaonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or sexually directed remarks constitute sexual harassment when submission to such conduct is made a condition of academic or employment decisions, or when such conduct persists despite its rejection."
*"Sexual harassment is a serious violation of professional ethics, and should be regarded and treated as such by members of the profession. Sexual harassment is a form of prohibited discrimination when an institution or individual employee is aware of a sexually hostile environment and condones, tolerates or allows that environment to exist. Colleges and universities should supply clear, fair institutional procedures under which charges of sexual harassment on campus can be brought, assessed, and acted on."
*"Complaints of sexual harassment at APA-sponsored activities should be brought to the chair of the committee for the defense of professional rights of philosophers or, if they arise in the context of placement activities, to the APA ombudsperson. Complaints of sexual harassment by or against APA staff members should be brought to the chair of the board."

===Black women===

There are few black women philosophers, which includes women of African and Caribbean ancestry, [[African-American]]s and other individuals from the [[African diaspora]]. According to philosopher [[Sally Haslanger]], the "numbers of philosophers of color, especially women of color, is even more appalling"; in a 2003 study, there "...was insufficient data for any racial group of women other than white women to report." &lt;ref name="opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/women-in-philosophy-do-the-math/?_r=0|title=Women in Philosophy? Do the Math|first=Sally|last=Haslanger|date=|website=nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the "...representation of scholars of color is plausibly worse than in any other field in the academy, including not only physics, but also engineering."&lt;ref name="opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com"/&gt;  According to professor L.K. McPherson, there is a "gross underrepresentation of blacks in philosophy."&lt;ref name="newappsblog.com"&gt;L.K. McPherson. On Black Underrepresentation and Progress in the Profession. December 12, 2011. http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/12/new-apps-on-black-underrepresentation-and-progress-in-the-profession.html&lt;/ref&gt;  McPherson states that there is a "...willful, not necessarily a conscious, preference among many members of the philosophy profession largely to maintain the status quo in terms of: the social group profiles of members; the dynamics of prestige and influence; and the areas and questions deemed properly or deeply 'philosophical.' None of this is good for black folk."&lt;ref name="newappsblog.com"/&gt;

The first black woman in the US to do a PhD in philosophy was [[Joyce Mitchell Cook]], who obtained her degree in 1965 from [[Yale University]]. LaVerne Shelton was also one of the earliest black women to receive a PhD in philosophy. Other notable women include [[Angela Davis]], a political activist who specializes in writing about [[feminism]], [[critical theory]], [[Marxism]], [[popular music]], [[social consciousness]], and the philosophy of punishment and prisons; [[Kathryn Gines]], the founding director of the Collegium of Black Woman Philosophers, who specializes in [[continental philosophy]], [[Africana philosophy]], [[Race theory|philosophy of race]] and Black [[feminist philosophy]]; [[Anita L. Allen]], the first African-American woman to complete both a JD and a PhD in philosophy, who focuses on political and legal philosophy, and who in 2010 was appointed by [[President Obama]] to sit on the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues; and [[Adrian Piper]], an analytical philosopher who received a PhD in philosophy from Harvard; Jaqueline Scott, who received a PhD in philosophy from [[Stanford University]], and who specializes in [[Nietzsche]], nineteenth-century philosophy, race theory and [[African-American philosophy]].

=== Asian women ===
Few Asian women are recognized in contemporary Western philosophy. In a [[The New York Times|New York Times]] interview&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/04/06/asian-american-woman-philosopher/|title=Asian, American, Woman, Philosopher|last=Yancy|first=George|last2=Lee|first2=Emily S.|date=2015-04-06|website=Opinionator|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[George Yancy]], Korean-American philosopher Emily S. Lee, assistant professor of philosophy at [[California State University, Fullerton]], states, "I wonder if some of my experiences occur from being Asian-American, in the ways people stereotypically assume that I must specialize in certain areas of philosophy or behave in specific ways, such as being quiet and subdued." She postulates that the social forces that stereotype and encourage Asian-Americans to enter more lucrative and secure fields (such as engineering or medicine) combined with influences within the field of philosophy discouraging Asian-American youths from continuing their study in the field has led to the extremely small population of Asian-American female philosophers. [[University of Washington]] philosophy professor Carole Lee's report in the [[American Philosophical Association]]'s newsletter on Asian and Asian-American Philosophers and Philosophies suggests&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.apaonline.org/resource/collection/2EAF6689-4B0D-4CCB-9DC6-FB926D8FF530/AsianV14n1.pdf|title=Asian Americans, Positive Stereotyping, and Philosophy|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Asian women face conflicting stereotypes, making it difficult for them to fit into the field of philosophy: "Women are stereotyped as submissive rather than aggressive and as being bad at math: they lack both characteristics associated with philosophy." On the other had, "Asian Americans are stereotyped as being mathematical; however, they are characterized in ''passive'' rather than aggressive terms." Philosopher David Kim offers the explanation that a lack of Asian American mentors in philosophy and "derogation of philosophical thought that resonates with their identity" may also contribute to the wide disparity.

==Reports from the US ==
[[U.S. Department of Education]] reports indicate that [[philosophy]] is one of the least proportionate fields in the [[humanities]] with respect to gender.&lt;ref name="Salary, Promotion 1997"/&gt; Although reports indicate that philosophy as a professional field is disproportionately male, no clear, unequivocal data exists on the number of women currently in philosophy, or indeed, on the number of men in philosophy, and it is debatable how to define what it means to be ‘in philosophy.’ This can variously be defined as the current number of Ph.D. holders in philosophy, the current number of women teaching philosophy in two- and four- year institutions of higher learning either/both full-time and/or part-time (no one [[data set]] exists which measures these), or the current number of living women with publications in philosophy. The lack of clear data makes it difficult to establish gender proportions, but the consensus among those who have tried to arrive at an estimate is that women make up between 17% and 30% of academically employed philosophers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The [[National Center for Education Statistics]]' 2000 report, "Salary, Promotion, and Tenure Status of Minority and Women Faculty in U.S. Colleges and Universities," estimates in Table 23 that the total number of "History and Philosophy" U.S. citizens and full-time faculty who primarily taught in 1992 was 19,000, of which 79% were men (i.e. 15,010 men in history and philosophy), 21% were women (3,990). They add, "In fact, men were at least twice as likely as women to teach history and philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;NCES (2000), previously cited.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Anita L Allen.JPG|thumb|left|180px|[[Anita L. Allen]] (born 1953) is a professor of law and professor of philosophy at the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]].]]
In their 1997 report, "[http://nces.ed.gov/pubs97/97973.pdf Characteristics and Attitudes of Instructional Faculty and Staff in the Humanities]," NCES notes, that about "one-half of full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-year institutions in English and literature (47 percent) and foreign languages (50 percent) were female in the fall of 1992, compared with less than one-half of instructional faculty and staff in history (24 percent) and philosophy and religion (13 percent) (table 4)." In this report they measure Philosophy and Religion in the same data set, and estimate the total number of full-time instructional Philosophy and Religion faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 7,646. Of these, 87.3% are male (6675 men),
12.7 are female (971 women).&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997), previously cited.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 report measures History Full-time instructional faculty and staff in 4-yr institutions to be 11,383; male:76.3 (8,686 men);
female: 23.7 (2,697 women). The numbers of women in philosophy from the two studies are not easily comparable, but one rough method may be to subtract the number of women in history in the 1997 report from the number of women estimated to be in 'history and philosophy' in the 2000 report. Doing so suggests that as a rough estimate, 1,293 women are employed as instructors of philosophy.

The 1997 report indicates that a large portion of all humanities instructors are part-time.&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997): "Forty-two percent of all instructional faculty and staff were employed part time by their institution in the fall of 1992. Forty-five percent of [all U.S.] humanities faculty were employed part time."&lt;/ref&gt; Part-time employees are disproportionately female but not majority female.&lt;ref&gt;NCES (1997): "Part-time faculty members were more likely to be female (45 percent) than full-time faculty (33 percent), although the majority of both part- and full-time faculty were male (55 percent and 67 percent, respectively)."&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, considerations of full-time employees only necessarily leave out data on many women working part-time to remain active in their field. In 2004, the percentage of Ph.D.s in philosophy, within the U.S., going to women reached a record high percentage: 33.3%, or 121 of the 363 doctorates awarded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/issues/sed-2004.pdf Hoffer, T.B., V.

* Differential treatment: male and female university students may be treated differently in the  classroom.
* Vicious circle: female students do not feel inclined to study philosophy because of a lack of contact with female philosophy professors. 
* Misleading statistics: university administrators focus on gender representation in the humanities overall, which obscures the disparity in philosophy.&lt;ref name="lemmingsblog.blogspot.com"/&gt;

While there were women philosophers since the earliest times, and some were accepted as philosophers during their lives, almost no woman philosophers have entered the philosophical [[Western canon]].&lt;ref name="Duran, Jane 2005"/&gt;  Historians of philosophy are faced with two main problems. The first being the exclusion of women philosophers from history and philosophy texts, which leads to a lack of knowledge about women philosophers among philosophy students. The second problem deals with what the canonical philosophers had to say about philosophy and women's place in it. In the past twenty-five years there has been an exponential increase in feminist writing about the history of philosophy and what has been considered the philosophical canon.&lt;ref&gt;Witt, Charlotte and Shapiro, Lisa, "Feminist History of Philosophy", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/feminism-femhist/&gt;.
  http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-femhist/&lt;/ref&gt; According to Eugene Sun Park, "[p]hilosophy is predominantly white and predominantly male. This homogeneity exists in almost all aspects and at all levels of the discipline." &lt;ref name="read.hipporeads.com"/&gt; According to [[Jennifer Saul]], a professor of philosophy at the University of Sheffield, "[p]hilosophy, the oldest of the humanities, is also the malest (and the whitest).  While other areas of the humanities are at or near gender parity, philosophy is actually more overwhelmingly male than even mathematics."&lt;ref name="salon.com"/&gt;

In the May 13, 2015 issue of ''The Atlantic'', Susan Price notes that even though Kant's first work in 1747 cites [[Emilie du Chatelet|Émilie Du Châtelet]], a philosopher who was a "...scholar of Newton, religion, science, and mathematics", "her work won’t be found in the 1,000-plus pages of the new edition of The Norton Introduction to Philosophy." &lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; The Norton Introduction does not name a female philosopher until the book begins to cover the mid-20th century. Scholars argue that women philosophers are also absent from the "...other leading anthologies used in university classrooms." &lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Price states that university philosophy anthologies do not usually mention 17th century women philosophers such as [[Margaret Cavendish]], [[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]], and [[Lady Damaris Masham]].&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Price argues that the philosophical "...canon remains dominated by white males—the discipline that some say still hews to the myth that genius is tied to gender."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; Amy Ferrer, executive director of the American Philosophical Association, states that “...women have been systematically left out of the canon, and that women coming in have not been able to see how much influence women have had in the field."&lt;ref name="theatlantic.com"/&gt; ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', which as published in 1967, had "...articles on over 900 philosophers, [but it] did not include an entry for [[Mary Wollstonecraft|Wollstonecraft]], [[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]] or [[Simone de Beauvoir|de Beauvoir]]. "[T]hese women philosophers were scarcely even marginal" to the canon set out at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/feminism-femhist/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first1=Charlotte|last1=Witt|first2=Lisa|last2=Shapiro|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=11 July 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explaining the very small number of women philosophers, American academic and social critic [[Camille Paglia]] (born 1947) argues that "...women in general are less comfortable than men in inhabiting a highly austere, cold, analytical space, such as the one which philosophy involves. Women as a whole ...are more drawn to practical, personal matters. It is not that they inherently lack a talent or aptitude for philosophy or higher mathematics, but rather that they are more unwilling than men to devote their lives to a frigid space from which the natural and the human have been eliminated."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/this-britain/ten-great-female-philosophers-the-thinking-womans-women-299061.html|title=Ten great female philosophers: The thinking woman's women|author=|date=|website=independent.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia claims that "[t]oday's lack of major female philosophers is not due to lack of talent but to the collapse of philosophy", because, in her view, philosophy "... as traditionally practised may be a dead genre" that "belongs to a vanished age of much slower and rhetorically formal inquiry."&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

[[File:Hipparchia of Maroneia Villa Farnesina.jpg|thumb|right|200px| [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]]. Detail from a Roman wall painting in the [[Villa Farnesina]] in [[Rome]].]]
Some of the earliest philosophers were women, such as [[Hipparchia of Maroneia]] (active ca. 325 BC), [[Arete of Cyrene]] (active 5th–4th century BC) and [[Aspasia of Miletus]] (470–400 BC). Aspasia appears in the philosophical writings of [[Plato]], [[Xenophon]], Aeschines Socraticus and [[Antisthenes]]. Some scholars argue that Plato was impressed by her intelligence and wit and based his character [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]] in the ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' on her.&lt;ref name="Wider1986"&gt;K. Wider, "Women philosophers in the Ancient Greek World", 21–62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sykoutris"&gt;I. Sykoutris, ''Symposium (Introduction and Comments)'', 152–153&lt;/ref&gt; [[Socrates]] attributes to the (possibly fictional) [[Diotima of Mantinea]] his lessons in the art of Eros (or philosophical searching). [[Plato]]'s final views on women are highly contested, but the ''Republic'' suggests that women are equally capable of education, intellectual vision, and rule of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garside|first1=Christine|title=Plato on Women|journal=Feminist Studies|date=1975|pages=131–138|jstor=3177773|volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Jacobs, William "Platon on Female Emancipation and the Traditional Family"'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jacobs|first1=William|title=Plato on Female Emancipation and the Traditional Family|journal=Apeiron|date=June 1978|volume=12|issue=1|pages=29–31|doi=10.1515/apeiron.1978.12.1.29|jstor=40913404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable philosophers include:
*[[Theano of Croton]] (6th century BC)
*[[Aristoclea of Delphi]] (6th century BC)
*[[Sosipatra of Ephesus]] (4th century BC)
*[[Nicarete of Megara]] (flourished around 300 BC)

[[Medieval philosophy]] dates from the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD to the Renaissance in the 16th century. [[Hypatia]] (AD 350 – 370 to 415) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[mathematician]], astronomer, and philosopher in [[Roman Egypt|Egypt]], then a part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name="socrates"&gt;{{Cite book|title= Ecclesiastical History|last= Scholasticus|first= Socrates |authorlink= Socrates Scholasticus |year= |publisher= |location= |isbn= |url = http://cosmopolis.com/alexandria/hypatia-bio-socrates.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the head of the [[Neoplatonic]] school at [[Alexandria]], where she taught [[philosophy]] and [[astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, ''Groundbreaking Scientific Experiments, Inventions, and Discoveries''; ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press, 1999: ''"Greek Neoplatonist philosopher who lived and taught in Alexandria."''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Women of Mathematics: A Biobibliographic Sourcebook |last1=Mueller |first1=I. |authorlink= |author2=L.S.

*[[Moderata Fonte]] (1555–1592), critic of religion, feminist

===Modern philosophy===
The 17th century marks the beginning of the [[modern philosophy]] era, which ended in the early 20th century. During the 17th century, various women philosophers argued for the importance of education for women and two women philosophers influenced [[René Descartes]] and during the early part of the 18th century, two women philosophers commented on [[John Locke]]’s philosophy. [[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was the first woman to earn a university chair in a scientific field. [[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) demanded that French women be given the same rights as men, a position also taken by [[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) in her essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" and [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] in her essay ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792). During the 19th century, [[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876)  criticized the state of women's education and [[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858), [[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) and [[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) called for [[women's rights]]. [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) argued that women were oppressed by an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. Near the start of the 20th century, [[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was the first woman to become president of the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Women thinkers such as [[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940), an [[anarchism|anarchist]], and
[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919), a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], are known for their political views.

====17th century====
*[[Marie de Gournay]] (1565–1645) was a critic of religion, proto-feminist, translator and novelist who insisted that women should be educated.
*[[Anna Maria van Schurman]] (1607–1678) was a multilinguist known for her defense of [[female education]]. 
*[[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Elisabeth of Bohemia]] (1618–1680) influenced many key figures and philosophers, most notably [[René Descartes]], who she corresponded with. She questioned Descartes' idea of [[Mind-body dualism|dualism]], or the mind being separate from the body, and his theories regarding communication between the mind and body. 
*[[Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Margaret Cavendish]] (1623–1673) was a philosopher and writer who addressed gender, power, manners, scientific methods, and philosophy.
*[[Anne Conway (philosopher)|Anne Conway]] (1631-1679) was an [[English people|English]] [[philosopher]] whose work, in the tradition of the [[Cambridge Platonists]], was an influence on [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Conway's thought is original as it is [[rationalist philosophy]], with hallmarks of gynocentric concerns and patterns, and in that sense it was unique among seventeenth-century systems.&lt;ref name="Duran2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jane Duran|title=Eight Women Philosophers: Theory, Politics, And Feminism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aIzVEF6J6SYC&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=13 January 2013|year=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-03022-2|pages=73–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Damaris Cudworth Masham]] (1659–1708) was an English philosopher, [[proto-feminist]], and advocate for women's education. 
*[[Mary Astell]] (1666–1731) was an English [[feminism|feminist]] writer and [[rhetorician]] known for advocacy of equal [[educational opportunities for women]], which earned her the title of "first English feminist."&lt;ref name="litencyc"&gt;Batchelor, Jennie.

[[File:FullerDaguerreotype.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The only known [[daguerreotype]] of [[Margaret Fuller]] (by [[John Plumbe]], 1846).]]
*[[Catharine Trotter Cockburn]] (1679–1749) published her first major philosophical work, ''A Defence of Mr. Lock[e]'s [[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' in 1702, at the age of 23. Much of the scholarly interest in her writing centres on [[gender studies]]. 
*[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706–1749) was a [[France|French]] mathematician, [[physicist]], and author during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. She translated and commented on [[Isaac Newton]]'s work ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. She criticized [[John Locke]]’s philosophy and emphasizes the necessity of the verification of knowledge through experience. She also theorized about [[free will]] and on the way to do [[metaphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;Hagengruber (2011: 8-12,24,53,54)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Laura Bassi]] (1711–1778) was an Italian philosopher and physicist who was the first woman in the world to earn a university chair in a scientific field of studies. She received a doctoral degree from the [[University of Bologna]] in May 1732,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Laura Bassi| work = MacTutor Biography| publisher = University of St Andrews| url = http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Bassi.html| accessdate = 30 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the third academic qualification ever bestowed on a woman by a university,&lt;ref name="Findlen, Paula"&gt;Findlen, Paula.

*[[Catharine Macaulay]] (1731–1791) was an English historian and writer. She attacked [[Edmund Burke]]'s ''[[Thoughts on the Cause of the Present Discontents]]'', calling it "a poison...".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hill|1992|p=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1790 ''Letters on Education'', she argued along the lines that [[Mary Wollstonecraft]] would do in 1792, that the apparent weakness of women was due to their mis-education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walters, Margaret|year=2006|title=Feminism: A Very Short Introduction|location=USA|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-280510-X|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Olympe de Gouges]] (1748–1793) was a French playwright and political [[activism|activist]] whose [[feminism|feminist]] and [[Abolitionism in France|abolitionist]] writings reached a large audience. She was an early feminist who demanded that French women be given the same rights as French men. In her ''[[Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen]]'' (1791), she challenged the practice of [[patriarchy|male authority]] and the notion of male–female inequality. 
*[[Judith Sargent Murray]] (1751–1820) was an early [[United States|American]] advocate for women's rights, an essayist, [[playwright]], [[poet]], and letter writer. She was one of the first American proponents of the idea of the equality of the sexes—that women, like men, had the capability of intellectual accomplishment and should be able to achieve economic independence. Among many other influential pieces, her landmark essay "[[On the Equality of the Sexes]]" paved the way for new thoughts and ideas proposed by other [[Feminism|feminist]] writers of the century. The essay predated [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' which was published in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hughes|first1=Mary|title=An Enlightened Woman: Judith Sargent Murray and the Call to Equality|journal=[[Pittsburgh Undergraduate Review|Undergraduate Review]]|date=2011|volume=7|issue=21|url=http://vc.bridgew.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1196&amp;context=undergrad_rev|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Mary Wollstonecraft]] (1759-1797) was an English writer, philosopher, and advocate of [[women's rights]]. She is regarded as one of the founding [[feminist philosophy|feminist philosophers]]. In ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' (1792), her most famous and influential work,&lt;ref&gt;Tomalin, 144–155; Wardle, 115ff; Sunstein, 192–202.&lt;/ref&gt; she argues that women are not naturally inferior to men, but appear to be only because they lack education. She suggests that both men and women should be treated as rational beings and imagines a [[social order]] founded on reason.

====19th century====
*[[Harriet Martineau]] (1802–1876) was an English [[social theorist]] and political writer, often cited as the first female [[sociologist]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;Hill, Michael R. (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qyzyUpMfh24C&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Harriet Martineau: Theoretical and Methodological Perspectives'']. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-94528-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote books and essays from a sociological, holistic, religious, domestic, and feminine perspective.  In ''Society in America'', she criticised the state of women's education, stating that the "intellect of women is confined by an unjustifiable restriction" of access to education; she urged women to become well-educated and free.
*[[Harriet Taylor Mill]] (1807–1858) was a philosopher and [[women's rights]] advocate. In [[John Stuart Mill]]'s autobiography, he claimed she was the joint author of most of the books and articles published under his name. He stated that "when two persons have their thoughts and speculations completely in common it is of little consequence, in respect of the question of originality, which of them holds the pen." Together, they wrote "Early Essays on Marriage and Divorce", published in 1832.&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;{{cite book|author=Tong, Rosemarie|title=Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction|year=2009|publisher=Westview Press (Perseus Books)|isbn=978-0-8133-4375-4|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate about the nature and extent of her collaboration is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/search/searcher.py?query=harriet+taylor+mill|title=Search (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|author=|date=|website=plato.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sarah Margaret Fuller]] (1810-1850) was an American journalist, critic, philosopher and [[women's rights]] advocate. Her book ''[[Woman in the Nineteenth Century]]'' is considered the first major [[feminism|feminist]] work in the United States. She was an advocate of women's rights and, in particular, women's education and the right to employment. Many other advocates for women's rights and feminism, including [[Susan B. Anthony]], cite Fuller as a source of inspiration.
*[[Antoinette Brown Blackwell]] (1825–1921) was the first woman to be ordained as a mainstream Protestant minister in the [[United States]]. She was a well-versed public speaker on controversial issues such as [[abolition of slavery]] and she sought to expand [[women's rights]]. In 1873 Blackwell founded the Association for the Advancement of Women.
*[[Victoria, Lady Welby]] (1837–1912) was a self-educated English [[philosopher of language]]. She was published articles in the leading English language academic journals of the day, ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' and ''[[The Monist]]''. She published her first philosophical book, ''What Is Meaning?  Studies in the Development of Significance'' in 1903, following it with ''Significs and Language: The Articulate Form of Our Expressive and Interpretive Resources'' in 1911. Welby's concern with the problem of meaning included (perhaps especially) the everyday use of language, and she coined the word ''significs'' for her approach. Welby's theories on signification anticipated contemporary [[semantics]], [[semiotics]], and [[semiology]]. 
*[[Bertha von Suttner]] (1843–1914) was a [[Czechs|Czech]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[Pacifism|pacifist]] and novelist. In 1905 she was the first woman to be awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/women.html|title=Nobel Prize Awarded Women|author=|date=|website=www.nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suttner's pacifism was influenced by the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] (Tolstoy praised ''Die Waffen nieder!'').&lt;ref name="weop"&gt;''Bertha von Suttner'' by [[Irwin Adams]].

*[[Helene von Druskowitz]] (1856–1918) was an Austrian philosopher, writer and music critic. She was the second woman to obtain a Doctorate in Philosophy, which she obtained in [[Zürich]]. She usually published under a male alias because of the predominant [[sexism]] of the era.
*[[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] (1860–1935) was an American [[feminist]], [[sociologist]], novelist, writer and [[social reform]]er. Her short story "[[The Yellow Wallpaper]]" became a bestseller. The story is about a woman who suffers from mental illness after three months of being closeted in a room by her husband. She argued that the domestic environment oppressed women through the patriarchal beliefs upheld by society.&lt;ref&gt;Ann J. Lane, ''To Herland and Beyond'', 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilman argued that women's contributions to civilization, throughout history, have been halted because of an [[androcentrism|androcentric]] culture. She argued that women were the underdeveloped half of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Davis and Knight, ''Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Her Contemporaries'', 206.&lt;/ref&gt; She believed economic independence would bring freedom and equality for women.

====Early 20th century====
*[[Mary Whiton Calkins]] (1863–1930) was an American [[philosopher]] and [[psychologist]]. She was also the first woman to become president of the [[American Psychological Association]] and the [[American Philosophical Association]]. Calkins studied psychology under [[William James]] and studied at [[Harvard University]], which allowed her to attend courses but refused to register her as a student, because she was a woman. She published her doctoral dissertation in 1896, and Harvard's Department of Philosophy and Psychology recommended that she be granted her PhD, but Harvard's President and board refused, as she was a woman. The President believed women should not study with men.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1980 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) | url = | journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 55–68 | doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1981.tb01033.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Furumoto | first1 = L | year = 1979 | title = Mary Whiton Calkins (1863-1930) fourteenth president of the American Psychological Association | url = | journal = Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 346–356 | doi=10.1002/1520-6696(197910)15:4&lt;346::aid-jhbs2300150408&gt;3.0.co;2-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; James was astonished at the university's decision, as he described her performance as "the most brilliant examination for the Ph.D. that we have had at Harvard." &lt;ref name="Hilgard, E.

*[[Emma Goldman]] (1869–1940) was an [[anarchism|anarchist]] known for her political activism, writing and speeches. She played a pivotal role in the development of [[anarchist political philosophy]] in the first half of the 20th century. She was viewed as a [[free-thinking]] "rebel woman" by admirers, and denounced by critics as an advocate of violent revolution.&lt;ref name="Voices"&gt;{{cite book |last=Streitmatter|first=Rodger|title=Voices of Revolution: The Dissident Press in America|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year =2001|location=New York|pages=122–134|isbn=0-231-12249-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her writing and lectures spanned a wide variety of issues, including [[atheism]], [[freedom of speech]], [[militarism]], [[capitalism]], marriage, [[free love]], and homosexuality. Although she distanced herself from [[first-wave feminism]] and its efforts toward [[women's suffrage]], she developed ways of incorporating gender politics into anarchism. 
*[[Rosa Luxemburg]] (1871–1919) was a [[Marxist theory|Marxist theorist]], [[Philosophy|philosopher]], [[Economics|economist]] and [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] of [[Polish-Jewish]] descent. While Luxemburg defended Marx's materialism dialectics and his conception of history, she called for spontaneous [[grass roots]]-based [[class struggle]].

[[File:Hannah_arendt-150x150.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) considered herself a political theorist, but she is often described as a philosopher.]]
[[Contemporary philosophy]] is the present period in the history of [[Western philosophy]] beginning at the end of the 19th century with the [[professionalization]] of the discipline and the rise of [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]] and [[continental philosophy]]. Some influential women philosophers from this period include:
*[[Ayn Rand]] (1905-1982) developed a philosophical system she named [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]], which affirms [[objective reality]] and advocates holding [[reason]] as absolute.&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/objectivity.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/reason.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ethics]], Rand championed [[rational egoism]] and [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/self-interest.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[politics]], she advocated for [[individual rights]] and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/individual_rights.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/capitalism.html&lt;/ref&gt; In [[esthetics]],  she upheld [[romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/romanticism.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rand regards [[Aristotle]] as her sole major philosophical influence.&lt;ref&gt;http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/aristotle.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Susanne Langer]] (1895–1985) was an American [[philosopher]] of [[philosopher of mind|mind]] and of [[philosopher of art|art]], who was influenced by [[Ernst Cassirer]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. She was one of the first women to achieve an academic career in [[philosophy]] and the first woman to be popularly and professionally recognized as an American philosopher. Langer is best known for her 1942 book entitled ''[[Philosophy in a New Key]]''. It argued that there is a basic and pervasive human need to symbolize, to invent meanings, and to invest meanings in one’s world.&lt;ref name="gardner1"&gt;{{Citation|author=[[Howard Gardner]]|title=Art, Mind, and Brain: A Cognitive Approach to Creativity|chapter=Philosophy in a New Key Revisited: An Appreciation of Susanne Langer |publisher=Basic Books|pages=48–54|location=New York|url=http://www.anthonyflood.com/gardnerlanger.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Hannah Arendt]] (1906–1975) was a [[Germany|German]]-born [[Americans|American]] [[Jewish assimilation|assimilated]] [[Jews|Jewish]] [[political theory|political theorist]]. Though often described as a philosopher, she rejected that label on the grounds that philosophy is concerned with "man in the singular" and instead described herself as a political theorist because her work centers on the fact that "men, not Man, live on the earth and inhabit the world."&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Hannah. ''The Human Condition''. 2nd ed. Chicago: University of Chicago, 1998.&lt;!-- isbn needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Her works deal with the nature of [[power (sociology)|power]], and the subjects of politics, [[direct democracy]], [[authority]], and [[totalitarianism]]. The [[Hannah Arendt Prize]] is named in her honor.
[[File:Simone de Beauvoir.jpg|thumb|right|160px|[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]].]]
*[[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) was a French writer, intellectual, [[Existentialism|existentialist philosopher]], political activist, [[feminist]] and [[social theorist]]. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both [[feminist existentialism]] and [[feminist theory]].&lt;ref name="plato.stanford"&gt;Bergoffen, Debra, "Simone de Beauvoir", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/beauvoir/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and [[monograph]]s on philosophy, politics and social issues. She is known for her 1949 treatise ''[[The Second Sex]]'', a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary [[feminism]].
*[[Elizabeth Anscombe]] (1919–2001), usually cited as G. E. M. Anscombe, was a British [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]]. Anscombe's 1958 article "[[Modern Moral Philosophy]]" introduced the term "[[consequentialism]]" into the language of analytic philosophy, and had a seminal influence on contemporary [[virtue ethics]]. Her monograph ''[[Intention (book)|Intention]]'' is generally recognised as her greatest and most influential work, and the continuing philosophical interest in the concepts of [[Intention (philosophy)|intention]], [[Action (philosophy)|action]] and [[practical reasoning]] can be said to have taken its main impetus from this work.  [[Mary Warnock]] described her in 2006 as "the undoubted giant among women philosophers" while [[John Joseph Haldane|John Haldane]] said she "certainly has a good claim to be the greatest woman philosopher of whom we know".&lt;ref name="Haldane"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haldane|first=John|title=In Memoriam: G. E. M. Anscombe (1919–2001)|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|date=June 2000|volume=53|issue=4|pages=1019–1021|jstor=20131480}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mary Midgley]] (born 1919) is an English [[ethics|moral philosopher]]. A senior lecturer in philosophy at [[Newcastle University]], she is known for her work on science, ethics and [[animal rights]]. Midgley strongly opposes [[reductionism]] and [[scientism]], and any attempts to make science a substitute for the humanities—a role for which it is, she argues, wholly inadequate. She has written extensively about what philosophers can learn from nature, particularly from animals. ''The Guardian'' has described her as a fiercely combative philosopher and the UK's "foremost scourge of 'scientific pretension.'"&lt;ref name=brown2001&gt;{{cite web|last=Brown|first=Andrew|title=Mary, Mary, quite contrary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/saturday_review/story/0,3605,421561,00.html|work=The Guardian|date=13 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mary Warnock]] (born 1924) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[philosopher]] of [[ethics|morality]], [[philosophy of education|education]] and [[philosophy of mind|mind]], and writer on [[existentialism]]. From 1984 to 1991, she was [[Master (college)|Mistress]] of [[Girton College, Cambridge]]. Warnock studied at [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and was made an Honorary Fellow in 1984. She delivered the [[Gifford Lectures]], entitled "Imagination and Understanding," at the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1992. She has written extensively on [[ethics]], [[existentialism]] and [[philosophy of mind]].&lt;ref name=Honderich&gt;{{cite book|last=Honderich|first=Ted|title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-866132-0|page=907|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Philippa Foot]] (1920-2010) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]], most notable for her works in [[ethics]]. She was one of the founders of contemporary [[virtue ethics]], inspired by the ethics of [[Aristotle]]. Her later career marked a significant change in view from her work in the 1950s and '60s, and may be seen as an attempt to modernize [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] ethical theory, to show that it is adaptable to a contemporary world view, and thus, that it could compete with such popular theories as modern [[deontology|deontological]] and [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] ethics.  Some of her work was crucial in the re-emergence of [[normative ethics]] within [[analytic philosophy]], especially her critique of [[consequentialism]] and of [[non-cognitivism]]. A familiar example is the continuing discussion of an example of hers referred to as the [[trolley problem]]. Foot's approach was influenced by the later work of [[Wittgenstein]], although she rarely dealt explicitly with materials treated by him.
*[[Patricia Churchland]] (born 1943) is a Canadian-American [[philosopher]] noted for her contributions to [[neurophilosophy]] and the [[philosophy of mind]]. She is UC President's professor of philosophy emerita at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (UCSD), where she has taught since 1984. Educated at the [[University of British Columbia]], the [[University of Pittsburgh]], and the [[University of Oxford]], she taught philosophy at the [[University of Manitoba]] from 1969 to 1984.
*[[Susan Haack]] (born 1945) is distinguished professor in the humanities, professor of philosophy, and professor of law at the University of Miami. She earned her PhD at [[Cambridge University]]. She has written on [[logic]], the [[philosophy of language]], [[epistemology]], and [[metaphysics]]. Her [[pragmatism]] follows that of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. Haack's major contribution to philosophy is her [[epistemology|epistemological]] theory called [[foundherentism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aune | first1 = B. | title = Haack's ''Evidence and Inquiry''| journal = Philosophy and Phenomenological Research | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 627–632 | doi = 10.2307/2108389 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Flage | first1 = D.
