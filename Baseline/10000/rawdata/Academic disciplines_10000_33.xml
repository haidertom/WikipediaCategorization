[[File:Delta-O-18 in deep sea sediment-svg.svg|thumb|300px|[[δ18O|{{delta|18|O|}}]], a proxy for temperature, for the last 600,000 years (an average from several deep sea sediment carbonate samples)]]

The '''100,000-year problem''' ("100&amp;nbsp;ky problem", "100&amp;nbsp;ka problem") of the [[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovitch theory]] of [[orbital forcing]] refers to a discrepancy between the reconstructed [[geologic temperature record]] and the reconstructed amount of incoming solar radiation, or [[insolation]] over the past 800,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raymo|first=Maureen E.|author-link=Maureen Raymo|last2=Nisancioglu|first2=Kerim H.|date=|year=2003|title=The 41 kyr world: Milankovitch’s other unsolved mystery|url=|journal=Paleoceanography|volume=18|issue=1|pages=|bibcode=2003PalOc..18.1011R|doi=10.1029/2002PA000791|quote=All serious students of Earth's climate history have heard of the '100 kyr problem' of Milankovitch orbital theory, namely the lack of an obvious explanation of the dominant ~100 kyr periodicity in climate records of the last 800,000 years.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to variations in the Earth's orbit, the amount of insolation varies with periods of around 21,000, 40,000, 100,000, and 400,000 years. Variations in the amount of incident solar energy drive changes in the [[climate]] of the Earth, and are recognised as a key factor in the timing of initiation and termination of [[glaciation]]s.

While there is a Milankovitch cycle in the range of 100,000 years, related to Earth's [[orbital eccentricity]], its contribution to variation in insolation is much smaller than those of [[precession]] and [[obliquity]]. The 100,000-year-problem refers to the lack of an obvious explanation for the periodicity of [[ice age]]s at roughly 100,000 years for the past million years, but not before, when the dominant periodicity corresponded to 41,000 years.
The unexplained transition between the two periodicity regimes is known as the [[Middle Pleistocene|mid-Pleistocene]] transition, dated to some 800,000 years ago.

The related "400,000-year-problem" refers to the absence of a 400,000-year periodicity due to [[orbital eccentricity]] in the geological temperature record over the past 1.2&amp;nbsp;million years.&lt;ref&gt;Richard John Huggett, [https://books.google.ch/books?id=_DF-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT95  "Problems with orbital forcing"], ''The Natural History of Earth: Debating Long-Term Change in the Geosphere and Biosphere'', Routledge Studies in Physical Geography and Environment, 2006.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition of the 100,000-year cycle==
[[Image:Epica-vostok-grip-140kyr.png|thumb|300px|A &amp;delta;&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/suP&gt;O record for the past 140,000&amp;nbsp;years from Greenland ([[NGRIP]]) and Antarctica ([[EPICA]], [[Vostok Station#Ice core drilling|Vostok]]) ice cores]]

The [[geologic temperature record]] can be [[palaeoclimatology|reconstructed]] from sedimentary evidence. Perhaps the most useful indicator of past climate is the [[isotope fractionation|fractionation]] of [[oxygen isotope]]s, denoted [[&amp;delta;18O|''&amp;delta;''&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]]. This fractionation is controlled mainly by the amount of water locked up in ice and the absolute temperature of the planet, and has allowed a timescale of [[marine isotope stage]]s to be constructed.

By the late 1990s, {{delta|18|O}} records of air (in the [[Vostok Station#Ice core drilling|Vostok]] ice core) and marine [[foramanifera|sediments]] was available and was compared with estimates of [[insolation]], which should affect both temperature and ice volume. As described by [[Nicholas Shackleton|Shackleton]] (2000), the deep-sea sediment record of {{delta|18|O}} "is dominated by a 100,000-year cyclicity that is universally interpreted as the main ice-age rhythm". Shackleton (2000) adjusted the time scale of the Vostok ice core {{delta|18|O}} record to fit the assumed [[orbital forcing]] and used spectral analysis to identify and subtract the component of the record that in this interpretation could be attributed to a linear (directly proportional) response to the orbital forcing. The residual signal (the remainder), when compared with the residual from a similarly retuned marine core isotope record, was used to estimate the proportion of the signal that was attributable to ice volume, with the rest (having attempted to allow for the [[Dole effect]]) being attributed to temperature changes in the deep water.

The 100,000-year component of ice volume variation was found to match sea level records based on coral age determinations, and to lag orbital eccentricity by several thousand years, as would be expected if orbital eccentricity were the pacing mechanism. Strong non-linear "jumps" in the record appear at [[deglaciation]]s, although the 100,000-year periodicity was not the strongest periodicity in this "pure" ice volume record.

The separate deep sea temperature record was found to vary directly in phase with orbital eccentricity, as did Antarctic temperature and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; so eccentricity appears to exert a geologically immediate effect on air temperatures, deep sea temperatures, and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Shackleton (2000) concluded: "The effect of orbital eccentricity probably enters the paleoclimatic record through an influence on the concentration of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;".&lt;ref name="Shackleton2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shackleton, N.J.|first=|authorlink=Nicholas Shackleton|date=|year=2000|title=The 100,000-Year Ice-Age Cycle Identified and Found to Lag Temperature, Carbon Dioxide, and Orbital Eccentricity|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/289/5486/1897?ck=nck|journal=Science|volume=289|issue=5486|pages=1897–1902|bibcode=2000Sci...289.1897S|doi=10.1126/science.289.5486.1897|pmid=10988063|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elkibbi and Rial (2001) identified the 100&amp;nbsp;ka cycle as one of five main challenges met by the [[Milankovitch cycles|Milankovitch]] model of [[orbital forcing]] of the ice ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elkibbi Maya, Rial Jose A |year=2001 |title=An outsider's review of the astronomical theory of the climate: is the eccentricity-driven insolation the main driver of the ice ages? |journal=Earth-Science Reviews |volume=56 |pages=161–177 |doi=10.1016/s0012-8252(01)00061-7|bibcode=2001ESRv...56..161E }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypotheses to explain the problem==
[[Image:Earth obliquity range.jpg|alt=Diagram shows that obliquity varies from 22.1 to 24.5 degrees.|thumb||The effect of obliquity variations may, in concert with precession, be amplified by orbital inclination.]]

As the 100,000-year periodicity only dominates the climate of the past million years, there is insufficient information to separate the component frequencies of eccentricity using spectral analysis, making the reliable detection of significant longer-term trends more difficult, although the spectral analysis of much longer palaeoclimate records, such as the Lisiecki and Raymo stack of marine cores&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lorraine-lisiecki.com/stack.html |title=LR04 Benthic Stack |last=Lisiecki |first=Lorraine |authorlink=Lorraine Lisiecki |year=2005 |publisher=lorraine-lisiecki.com |accessdate=Oct 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and James Zachos' composite isotopic record, helps to put the last million years in longer term context. Hence there is still no clear proof of the mechanism responsible for the 100&amp;nbsp;ka periodicity—but there are several credible hypotheses.

===Climatic resonance===
The mechanism may be internal to the Earth system. The Earth's climate system may have a natural [[resonance|resonance frequency]] of 100&amp;nbsp;ka; that is to say, feedback processes within the climate automatically produce a 100&amp;nbsp;ka effect, much as a bell naturally rings at a certain pitch.&lt;ref name="Ghil1994"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ghil|first=Michael|date=|year=1994|title=Cryothermodynamics: the chaotic dynamics of paleoclimate|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=193534|journal=Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena|volume=77|issue=1–3|pages=130–159|bibcode=1994PhyD...77..130G|doi=10.1016/0167-2789(94)90131-7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gildor2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gildor|first=Hezi|last2=Tziperman|first2=Eli|date=|year=2000|title=Sea ice as the glacial cycles' climate switch: Role of seasonal and orbital forcing|url=|journal=Paleoceanography|volume=15|issue=6|pages=605–615|bibcode=2000PalOc..15..605G|doi=10.1029/1999PA000461|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents to this claim point out that the resonance would have to have developed 1 million years ago, as a 100&amp;nbsp;ka periodicity was weak to non-existent for the preceding 2&amp;nbsp;million years. This is feasible—[[continental drift]] and [[sea floor spreading]] rate change have been postulated as possible causes of such a change.&lt;ref name=Ruddiman2006 /&gt; Free oscillations of components of the Earth system have been considered as a cause,&lt;ref name="Saltzman1984"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Saltzman|first=Barry|last2=Hansen|first2=Anthony R.|last3=Maasch|first3=Kirk A.|date=|title=The late Quaternary glaciations as the response of a three-component feedback system to Earth-orbital forcing|url=|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|publication-date=December 1984|volume=41|issue=23|pages=3380–3389|bibcode=1984JAtS...41.3380S|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1984)041&lt;3380:TLQGAT&gt;2.0.CO;2|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but too few Earth systems have a thermal inertia on a thousand-year timescale for any long-term changes to accumulate. The most common hypothesis looks to the Northern Hemisphere ice sheets, which might expand through a few shorter cycles until large enough to undergo a sudden collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Denton |first1=G. H. |last2=Anderson |first2=R. F.|display-authors=etal |title=The Last Glacial Termination |journal=Science |year=2010 |volume=328 |issue=5986 |pages=1652–1656 |doi=10.1126/science.1184119|bibcode=2010Sci...328.1652D }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 100,000-year problem has been scrutinized by José A. Rial, Jeseung Oh and Elizabeth Reischmann&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rial|first=José A.|last2=Oh|first2=Jeseung|last3=Reischmann|first3=Elizabeth|date=|title=Synchronization of the climate system to eccentricity forcing and the 100,000-year problem|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n4/full/ngeo1756.html|journal=Nature Geoscience|publication-date=2013-03-10|volume=6|issue=4|pages=289–293|bibcode=2013NatGe...6..289R|doi=10.1038/NGEO1756|accessdate=Oct 16, 2014|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who find that master-slave synchronization between the climate systems natural frequencies and the eccentricity forcing started the 100&amp;nbsp;ky ice ages of the late Pleistocene and explain their large amplitude.

===Orbital inclination===
[[Image:Earth precession.jpg|alt=Drawing shows the preseasonal change in orbital inclination as the earth turns counter-clock wise.|thumb|Precessional cycles may produce a 100,000 year effect.]]

[[Milankovitch cycles#Orbital inclination|Orbital inclination]] has a 100&amp;nbsp;ka periodicity, while [[Milankovitch cycles#Orbital shape|eccentricity]]'s 95 and 125ka periods could inter-react to give a 108ka effect. While it is possible that the less significant, and originally overlooked, inclination variability has a deep effect on climate,&lt;ref name="Muller1995"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Muller|first=Richard A.|last2=MacDonald|first2=Gordon J.|date=|year=1995|title=Glacial cycles and orbital inclination|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/377107b0|journal=Nature|publication-date=1995-09-14|volume=377|issue=6545|pages=107–108|bibcode=1995Natur.377..107M|doi=10.1038/377107b0|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the eccentricity only modifies insolation by a small amount: 1–2% of the shift caused by the 21,000-year precession and 41,000-year obliquity cycles.  Such a big impact from inclination would therefore be disproportionate in comparison to other cycles.&lt;ref name="Ruddiman2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ruddiman|first=William F.|date=|title=Orbital changes and climate|url=http://www.geo.vu.nl/users/peef/teaching/orbital_forcing/assets/Ruddiman_2006_QSR.pdf|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|publication-date=December 2006|volume=25|issue=23–24|pages=3092–3112|bibcode=2006QSRv...25.3092R|doi=10.1016/j.quascirev.2006.09.001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030023122/http://www.geo.vu.nl/users/peef/teaching/orbital_forcing/assets/Ruddiman_2006_QSR.pdf|archive-date=Oct 30, 2008|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One possible mechanism suggested to account for this was the passage of Earth through regions of cosmic dust. Our eccentric orbit would take us through dusty clouds in space, which would act to occlude some of the incoming radiation, shadowing the Earth.&lt;ref name=Muller1995 /&gt;

In such a scenario, the abundance of the isotope [[helium-3|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He]], [[cosmogenic|produced]] by [[cosmic ray|solar ray]]s splitting gases in the upper atmosphere, would be expected to decrease—and initial investigations did indeed find such a drop in &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He abundance.&lt;ref name="Farley1995"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Farley|first=K.A.|date=|title=Cenozoic variations in the flux of interplanetary dust recorded by &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;He in a deep-sea sediment|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/376153a0|journal=Nature|publication-date=1995-07-13|volume=376|issue=6536|pages=153–156|bibcode=1995Natur.376..153F|doi=10.1038/376153a0|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kortenkamp1998"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kortenkamp|first=Stephen J.|last2=Dermott|first2=Stanley F.|date=1998-05-08|title=A 100,000-Year Periodicity in the Accretion Rate of Interplanetary Dust|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/280/5365/874|journal=Science|volume=280|issue=5365|pages=874–6|bibcode=1998Sci...280..874K|doi=10.1126/science.280.5365.874|pmid=9572725|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Others have argued possible effects from the dust entering the atmosphere itself, for example by increasing cloud cover (on July 9 and January 9, when the Earth passes through the invariable plane, [[mesospheric cloud]] increases).&lt;ref name="pmid11607741"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Muller|first=Richard A.|last2=MacDonald|first2=Gordon J.|date=|title=Spectrum of 100-kyr glacial cycle: orbital inclination, not eccentricity.|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=11607741|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A|publication-date=1997-08-05|volume=94|issue=16|pages=8329–34|bibcode=1997PNAS...94.8329M|doi=10.1073/pnas.94.16.8329|pmc=33747|pmid=11607741|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the 100&amp;nbsp;ka eccentricity cycle can act as a "pacemaker" to the system, amplifying the effect of precession and obliquity cycles at key moments, with its perturbation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hays|first=J.D.|last2=Imbrie|first2=John|last3=Shackleton|first3=N.J.|date=1976-12-10|title=Variations in the Earth's Orbit: Pacemaker of the Ice Ages|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/194/4270/1121|journal=Science|volume=194|issue=4270|pages=1121–32|bibcode=1976Sci...194.1121H|doi=10.1126/science.194.4270.1121|pmid=17790893|access-date=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precession cycles===
A similar suggestion holds the 21,636-year [[Milankovitch cycles#Apsidal precession|precession cycles]] solely responsible. Ice ages are characterized by the slow buildup of ice volume, followed by relatively swift melting phases. It is possible that ice built up over several precession cycles, only melting after four or five such cycles.&lt;ref name="Imbrie1980"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Imbrie|first=John|last2=Imbrie|first2=John Z.|date=1980-02-29|title=Modeling the Climatic Response to Orbital Variations|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/207/4434/943|journal=Science|volume=207|issue=4434|pages=943–53|bibcode=1980Sci...207..943I|doi=10.1126/science.207.4434.943|pmid=17830447|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar luminosity fluctuation===
A mechanism that may account for periodic fluctuations in solar luminosity has also been proposed as an explanation.   Diffusion waves occurring within the sun can be modeled in such a way that they explain the observed climatic shifts on earth.&lt;ref name="Ehrlich2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ehrlich|first=Robert|date=|title=Solar resonant diffusion waves as a driver of terrestrial climate change|url=http://mason.gmu.edu/%7Erehrlich/Diffusion_waves.pdf|journal=[[Journal of Atmospheric and Solar-Terrestrial Physics]]|publication-date=May 2007|volume=69|issue=7|pages=759–766|arxiv=astro-ph/0701117|bibcode=2007JASTP..69..759E|doi=10.1016/j.jastp.2007.01.005|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the He&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; signal again appears to contradict this finding.&lt;ref name="Marsh2007"&gt;{{cite arXiv|eprint=0706.3621|class=physics.gen-ph|first=Gerald E.|last=Marsh|title=Climate Change: The Sun's Role|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land vs. oceanic photosynthesis===
[[Image:Algal bloom 20040615.jpg|alt=The lighter coloring of irregular patches in the Atlantic Ocean off France shows where algae are blooming.|thumb|An [[algal bloom]]. The relative importance of land- and sea-based photosynthesis may fluctuate on a 100,000-year timescale.]]

The [[Dole effect]] describes trends in {{delta|18|O}} arising from trends in the relative importance of land-dwelling and oceanic [[photosynthesis|photosynthesizers]]. Such a variation is a plausible cause of the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Bender1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bender|first=Michael|last2=Sowers|first2=Todd|last3=Labeyrie|first3=Laurent|date=|title=The Dole effect and its variations during the last 130,000 years as measured in the Vostok ice core|url=http://www.whoi.edu/cms/files/bender94gbc_222964.pdf|journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles|publication-date=September 1994|volume=8|issue=3|pages=363–376|bibcode=1994GBioC...8..363B|doi=10.1029/94GB00724|accessdate=2007-05-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sowers1993"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sowers|first=Todd|last2=Bender|first2=Michael|last3=Labeyrie|first3=Laurent|last4=Martinson|first4=Doug|last5=Jouzel|first5=Jean|last6=Raynaud|first6=Dominique|last7=Pichon|first7=Jean Jacques|last8=Korotkevich|first8=Yevgeniy Sergeevich|date=|year=1993|title=A 135000-year Vostok-SPECMAP common temporal framework|url=|journal=Paleoceanography|volume=8|issue=6|pages=737–766|bibcode=1993PalOc...8..737S|doi=10.1029/93PA02328|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ongoing research===

The new chronology is inconsistent with the "inclination" theory of the 100,000-year cycle. The establishment of leads and lags against different orbital forcing components with this method—which uses the direct insolation control over nitrogen-oxygen ratios in ice core bubbles—is in principle a great improvement in the temporal resolution of these records and another significant validation of the Milankovitch hypothesis. An international climate modelling exercise (Abe-ouchi ''et al.'', Nature, 2013&lt;ref name="AbeOuchi2013"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Abe-Ouchi|first=Ayako|displayauthors=et al.|date=|year=2013|title=Insolation-driven 100,000-year glacial cycles and hysteresis of ice-sheet volume|url=|journal=Nature|volume=500|issue=7461|pages=190–193|bibcode=2013Natur.500..190A|doi=10.1038/nature12374|pmid=23925242|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) demonstrated that climate models can replicate the 100,000-year cyclicity given the orbital forcing and carbon dioxide levels of the late Pleistocene. The isostatic history of ice sheets was implicated in mediating the 100,000-year response to the orbital forcing. Larger ice sheets are lower in elevation because they depress the continental crust upon which they sit, and are therefore more vulnerable to melting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3021">'''Alfred Wotquenne''' ({{IPA-fr|wɔtkɛn|lang}}&lt;!--Belgian French phonology--&gt;; 25 January 1867{{spaced ndash}}25 September 1939) was a Belgian musical [[bibliographer]], best known for his catalogues of the works of [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]] and [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]].

==Biography==
Wotquenne was born in [[Lobbes]], [[Hainaut (province)|Hainault]], Belgium. He studied at [[Royal Conservatory of Brussels|Brussels' Conservatoire Royal]], where his teachers included [[Louis Brassin]] (piano), {{ill|Alphonse Mailly|fr}} (organ), and [[François-Auguste Gevaert]] (theory). In 1894 he was appointed the chief librarian of the conservatoire; he retained this post until 1918. During his time the library acquired a great many works, both printed and in manuscript.

The best known of Wotquenne's achievements is his 1905 bibliographical study of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, but he also performed similar services for other composers: [[Baldassare Galuppi]] (1900), [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] (1905), and [[Luigi Rossi]] (1909).&lt;ref name=grove&gt;''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'', 5th ed, 1954, Vol. IX, p. 368&lt;/ref&gt; He also contributed to a complete inventory of the works of a fellow-Belgian, the [[Liège]]-born [[André Grétry]].

Thanks to Wotquenne's efforts, C. P. E. Bach's pieces came to be known by their "Wq" numbers. They are now also known by their "H" numbers, from a new and more thorough catalogue by Eugene Helm (1989). A concordance between these systems is available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.wagner.edu/david-schulenberg/c-p-e-bach-pages/ Indexes, Concordances, and Other Material for the Study of Music by C.P.E. Bach], David Schulenberg, [[Wagner College]]&lt;/ref&gt;

By royal decree he lost the [[Order of Leopold (Belgium)|Order of Leopold]] and his position on 9 August 1919; he was convicted for "participating with the enemy".&lt;ref&gt;KB 9.8.1919: Leopoldsorde Schrapping: Werkdadige hulp aan den Vijand&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2017}} He was arrested in 1918.

From 1921 Wotquenne lived in France, working in [[Antibes]] as a choir master and organ teacher. He died at Antibes shortly after the outbreak of World War II.

'''Ann-Marie Williams''' is a [[Belizeans|Belizean]] public policy advisor, administrator and former journalist. After spending over two decades as a reporter, Williams became the first Executive Director for the National Women's Commission of Belize. She serves as a governmental advisor to the legislature and executive on issues impacting women. She was honored with the US Secretary of State's Women in Public Service Award in 2011.

==Early life==
Ann-Marie Williams was born in [[Belize City]], Belize, the first daughter of a family of six siblings.{{sfn|''El Guardian''|2014}} She was raised by a single mother, who worked as a teacher and librarian.{{sfn|Downs|2017}} At the age of seventeen, Williams began working as an announcer at [[Radio Belize]], at the time, the only radio broadcaster in the country. Completing a course on journalism at the Caribbean Institute of Media and Communication through the [[University of the West Indies]],{{sfn|''El Guardian''|2014}} she continued her education, earning a bachelor's degree from the [[University College of Belize]].{{sfn|''The Reporter''|2015}}

==Career==
In 1988, Williams won the Edison Coleman Award for a program she produced for radio and was among the first reporters to read the news for [[Radio Belize]]. In 1995, she began the newscasts at [[Krem Radio]], both writing and reading the news for a year. She went on to serve as a news anchor for Channel 3 and later at [[Great Belize Television|Channel 5]] television. In 2000, wanting to further her education, Williams attended the [[University of Sussex]] in England, earning a master's degree in gender and development. Upon completion of her degree, she returned to Belize and Channel 5. Perhaps her most remembered expose as a journalist was the breaking of the story on the sale of Belizean passports in 2002, for which she and Channel 5 received awards from the [[Caribbean Broadcasting Union]] for investigative journalism. In 2003, she became an editor at ''[[The Reporter (Belize)|The Reporter]]'' newspaper.{{sfn|''El Guardian''|2014}}

In 2008, Williams left journalism when she was appointed by the government, as the first executive director of the public policy advisory board on gender, the National Women's Commission. In that capacity, she administered public policy which relates to women's issues and advises the government on policies which expand women's equal access.{{sfn|''El Guardian''|2014}} In one program she implemented, the Women in Politics Project, women are trained in the political process and requirements to be a public servant.{{sfn|''El Guardian''|2012}} In 2011, from a pool of 200 international applicants, she received the US Secretary of State's Women in Public Service Award.{{sfn|''Ambergris Today''|2011}}

Williams and the National Women's Commission came under fire in 2013, after developing a revised gender policy for the country, from various church leaders, who were alarmed at the apparent inclusion of [[LGBT rights in Belize|Belize's LGBT community]].{{sfn|''News 5''|2013}} Williams' position was that the new policy included terminology to bring the document into line with the [[Constitution of Belize]], which bars discrimination.{{sfn|''News 5''|2013}}{{sfn|''7 News''|2013}} At the time, a court challenge to Belize's [[anti-sodomy law]] was pending with several of the church bodies as opponents to legalization.{{sfn|Scott|2015}} Despite the controversy, the cabinet approved the policy by consensus.{{sfn|Ramos|2013}} In 2014, Williams was named a "trailblazer" in the program launched by [[Kim Simplis Barrow]], Special Envoy for Women and Children.{{sfn|''El Guardian''|2014}} In 2015, she was awarded a Hubert Humphrey Fellowship and completed post-graduate studies at the [[American University Washington College of Law]] on [[human trafficking]].{{sfn|''The Reporter''|2015}} Williams launched an initiative for National Women's Commission in 2017 to reduce gender-based violence.{{sfn|''News 5''|2017}}

[[File:Cupertino_City_Center.jpg|thumb|alt=Cupertino City Center buildings.|For years, Apple ATG offices were in ''[[Cupertino,_California|Cupertino]]'' City Center buildings.]]

The '''Advanced Technology Group''' (ATG) was a corporate research laboratory at [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] from 1986 to 1997.&lt;ref name="Fast Company article June 2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Diaz |first1=Jesus |title=The legendary Apple research group that shaped our world |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90176202/how-apples-advanced-technology-group-changed-our-world |website=Fast Company |accessdate=11 September 2018 |date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ATG was an evolution of Apple's Education Research Group (ERG) and was started by [[Larry Tesler]] in October 1986 to study long term research into future technologies that were beyond the time frame or organizational scope of any individual product group. Over the next decade, it was led by [[David Nagel]], [[Richard LeFaivre]],&lt;ref name="pcmag lefaivre"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,1869187,00.asp | title=Rick Lefaivre: Ran Apple's Advanced Technology Group | work=[[PC Magazine]] | date=October 12, 2005 | accessdate=February 27, 2012 | author=Metz, Cade}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Donald Norman]].&lt;ref name="guardian apple"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/oct/06/why-do-people-hate-apple | title=Why do some people really hate Apple? | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=October 6, 2011 | accessdate=February 27, 2012 | author=Arthur, Charles | quote=[Don] Norman, formerly vice-president of the Advanced Technology Group at Apple [...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was known as Apple Research Labs during Norman's tenure as VP of the organization.

ATG had research efforts in both hardware and software, with groups focused on such areas as Human-Computer Interaction, Speech Recognition, Educational Technology, Networking, Information Access, Distributed Operating systems, Collaborative Computing, Computer Graphics, and [[Language/action perspective]].

'''Applied mathematics''' is the application of [[mathematical model|mathematical method]]s by different fields such as [[science]], [[engineering]], [[business]], [[computer science]], and [[industry]]. Thus, applied mathematics is a combination of [[mathematical science]] and specialized knowledge. The term "applied mathematics" also describes the [[profession|professional specialty]]  in which mathematicians work on practical problems by formulating and studying mathematical models. In the past, practical applications have motivated the development of mathematical theories, which then became the subject of study in [[pure mathematics]] where abstract concepts are studied for their own sake. The activity of applied mathematics is thus intimately connected with research in pure mathematics.

== History ==
[[File:Elmer-pump-heatequation.png|thumb|right|A numerical solution to the [[heat equation]] on a pump casing model using the [[finite element method]].]]

Historically, applied mathematics consisted principally of [[Mathematical analysis|applied analysis]], most notably [[differential equations]]; [[approximation theory]] (broadly construed, to include [[Representation (mathematics)|representation]]s, [[Asymptotic analysis|asymptotic]] methods, [[Calculus of variations|variational methods]], and [[numerical analysis]]); and applied [[probability]].  These areas of mathematics related directly to the development of [[Newtonian physics]], and in fact, the distinction between mathematicians and physicists was not sharply drawn before the mid-19th century.  This history left a pedagogical legacy in the United States: until the early 20th century, subjects such as [[classical mechanics]] were often taught in applied mathematics departments at American universities rather than in [[physics]] departments, and [[fluid mechanics]] may still be taught in applied mathematics departments.&lt;ref name="Stolz2002"&gt;

== Divisions ==
[[File:HD-Rayleigh-Taylor.gif|left|thumb|Fluid mechanics is often considered a branch of applied mathematics and mechanical engineering.]]

Today, the term "applied mathematics" is used in a broader sense. It includes the classical areas noted above as well as other areas that have become increasingly important in applications. Even fields such as [[number theory]] that are part of [[pure mathematics]] are now important in applications (such as [[cryptography]]), though they are not generally considered to be part of the field of applied mathematics ''per se''. Sometimes, the term "[[applicable mathematics]]" is used to distinguish between the traditional applied mathematics that developed alongside physics and the many areas of mathematics that are applicable to real-world problems today.

There is no consensus as to what the various branches of applied mathematics are. Such categorizations are made difficult by the way mathematics and science change over time, and also by the way universities organize departments, courses, and degrees.

Many mathematicians distinguish between "applied mathematics," which is concerned with mathematical methods, and the "applications of mathematics" within science and engineering. A [[biology|biologist]] using a [[Matrix population models|population model]] and applying known mathematics would not be ''doing'' applied mathematics, but rather ''using'' it; however, mathematical biologists have posed problems that have stimulated the growth of pure mathematics. Mathematicians such as [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]] and [[Vladimir Arnold|Arnold]] deny the existence of "applied mathematics" and claim that there are only "applications of mathematics."  Similarly, non-mathematicians blend applied mathematics and applications of mathematics. The use and development of mathematics to solve industrial problems is also called "industrial mathematics".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | author=University of Strathclyde | title=Industrial Mathematics | url=http://www.maths.strath.ac.uk/applying/postgraduate/research_topics/industrial_mathematics | date=17 January 2008 | accessdate=8 January 2009 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804104748/http://www.maths.strath.ac.uk/applying/postgraduate/research_topics/industrial_mathematics | archive-date=2012-08-04 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of modern numerical mathematical methods and software has led to the emergence of [[computational mathematics]], [[computational science]], and [[computational engineering]], which use [[supercomputer|high-performance computing]] for the [[simulation]] of phenomena and the solution of problems in the sciences and engineering. These are often considered interdisciplinary.

Historically, mathematics was most important in the [[natural sciences]] and [[engineering]]. However, since [[World War II]], fields outside the physical sciences have spawned the creation of new areas of mathematics, such as [[game theory]] and [[social choice theory]], which grew out of economic considerations.

The advent of the computer has enabled new applications: studying and using the new computer technology itself ([[computer science]]) to study problems arising in other areas of science (computational science) as well as the mathematics of computation (for example, [[theoretical computer science]], [[computer algebra]], [[numerical analysis]]).  [[Statistics]] is probably the most widespread [[mathematical science]] used in the [[social sciences]], but other areas of mathematics, most notably [[economics]], are proving increasingly useful in these disciplines.

== Status in academic departments ==

Academic institutions are not consistent in the way they group and label courses, programs, and degrees in applied mathematics.  At some schools, there is a single mathematics department, whereas others have separate departments for Applied Mathematics and (Pure) Mathematics.  It is very common for Statistics departments to be separated at schools with graduate programs, but many undergraduate-only institutions include statistics under the mathematics department.

Many applied mathematics programs (as opposed to departments) consist of primarily cross-listed courses and jointly appointed faculty in departments representing applications.  Some Ph.D. programs in applied mathematics require little or no coursework outside mathematics, while others require substantial coursework in a specific area of application.  In some respects this difference reflects the distinction between "application of mathematics" and "applied mathematics".

Some universities in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] host departments of ''Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics'',&lt;ref&gt;For example see, [http://www.tait.ac.uk/History.html The Tait Institute: History (2nd par.)]. Accessed Nov 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.am.qub.ac.uk Dept of Applied Mathematics &amp; Theoretical Physics.] [[Queen's University, Belfast]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/institution/Queens_University_Belfast/department/Department_of_Applied_Mathematics_Theoretical_Physics DAMTP Belfast ResearchGate page].&lt;/ref&gt; but it is now much less common to have separate departments of pure and applied mathematics. A notable exception to this is the [[Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge|Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], housing the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] whose past holders include [[Isaac Newton]], [[Charles Babbage]], [[James Lighthill]], [[Paul Dirac]] and [[Stephen Hawking]].

Schools with separate applied mathematics departments range from [[Brown University]], which has a large Division of Applied Mathematics that offers degrees through the [[doctorate]], to [[Santa Clara University]], which offers only the [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in applied mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Santa Clara University Dept of Applied Mathematics |url=http://www.scu.edu/academics/bulletins/undergraduate/Department-of-Applied-Mathematics.cfm |accessdate=2011-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504005925/http://www.scu.edu/academics/bulletins/undergraduate/Department-of-Applied-Mathematics.cfm |archivedate=2011-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Research universities dividing their mathematics department into pure and applied sections include [[MIT]]. [[Brigham Young University]] also has an Applied and Computational Emphasis (ACME), a program that allows student to graduate with a Mathematics degree, with an emphasis in Applied Math. Students in this program also learn another skill (Computer Science, Engineering, Physics, Pure Math, etc.) to supplement their applied math skills.

== Associated mathematical sciences ==
[[File:Oldfaithful3.png|thumb|right|Applied mathematics has substantial overlap with statistics.]]

Applied mathematics is closely related to other mathematical sciences.

===Scientific computing===
[[Scientific computing]] includes applied mathematics (especially [[numerical analysis]]), [[computing science]] (especially [[high-performance computing]]), and mathematical modelling in a scientific discipline.

===Computer science===
[[Computer science]] relies on [[logic]], [[algebra]], [[graph theory]], and [[combinatorics]].

===Operations research and management science===
[[Operations research]] and [[management science]] are often taught in faculties of engineering, business, and public policy.

===Statistics===
Applied mathematics has substantial overlap with the discipline of statistics. [[Statisticians|Statistical theorists]] study and improve statistical procedures with mathematics, and statistical research often raises mathematical questions. Statistical theory relies on [[Probability theory|probability]] and [[optimal decision|decision theory]], and makes extensive use of scientific computing, analysis, and [[Mathematical optimization|optimization]]; for the [[design of experiments]], statisticians use [[algebraic statistics|algebra]] and [[combinatorial design]]. Applied mathematicians and [[statistician]]s often work in a department of mathematical sciences (particularly at colleges and small universities).

===Actuarial science===
[[Actuarial science]] applies probability, statistics, and economic theory to assess risk in insurance, finance and other industries and professions.

===Mathematical economics===
[[Mathematical economics]] is the application of  mathematical methods to represent theories and analyze problems in economics. The applied methods usually refer to nontrivial mathematical techniques or approaches. Mathematical economics is based on statistics, probability, mathematical programming (as well as other [[computational economics|computational methods]]), operations research, game theory, and some methods from mathematical analysis. In this regard, it resembles  (but is distinct from) [[financial mathematics]], another part of applied mathematics.

According to the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] (MSC), mathematical economics falls into the [[Mathematics Subject Classification#Applied mathematics / other|Applied mathematics/other]] classification of category 91:
:Game theory, economics, social and behavioral sciences

with [http://msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=MSC2010 MSC2010] classifications for '[[Game theory]]' at codes [http://msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=91Axx 91Axx] and for 'Mathematical economics' at codes [http://msc2010.org/mscwiki/index.php?title=91Bxx 91Bxx].

===Applicable mathematics===
'''Applicable mathematics''' is a subdiscipline of applied mathematics, although there is no consensus as to a precise definition.&lt;ref name=OtteEtAl/&gt; Sometimes the term "applicable mathematics" is used to distinguish between the traditional applied mathematics that developed alongside physics and the many areas of mathematics that are applicable to real-world problems today.

Mathematicians often distinguish between "applied mathematics" on the one hand, and the "applications of mathematics" or "applicable mathematics" both within and outside of science and engineering, on the other.&lt;ref name=OtteEtAl&gt;
[https://books.google.com/books?id=VgLZBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=applicable+mathematics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CeBNJXuG36&amp;sig=Gu4z--WLgzqf9BThN5q4WteCea8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=applicable%20mathematics&amp;f=false Perspectives on Mathematics Education: Papers Submitted by Members of the Bacomet Group, pgs 82-3.] Editors: H.

Volume 2 of Mathematics Education Library; Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2012. {{ISBN|9400945043}}, 9789400945043.&lt;/ref&gt; Some mathematicians emphasize the term applicable mathematics to separate or delineate the traditional applied areas from new applications arising from fields that were previously seen as pure mathematics.&lt;ref name=rektorys/&gt; For example, from this viewpoint, an ecologist or geographer using population models and applying known mathematics would not be doing applied, but rather applicable, mathematics. Even fields such as number theory that are part of pure mathematics are now important in applications (such as [[cryptography]]), though they are not generally considered to be part of the field of applied mathematics ''per se''.

Other authors prefer describing ''applicable mathematics'' as a union of "new" mathematical applications with the traditional fields of applied mathematics.&lt;ref name=rektorys&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=-sztCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR17&amp;dq=survey+of+applicable+mathematics&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=applicable%20mathematics&amp;f=false Survey of Applicable Mathematics, pg xvii (Foreword). ] K. Rektorys; 2nd edition, illustrated. Springer, 2013. {{ISBN|9401583080}}, 9789401583084.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.math.ust.hk/~mahsieh/APMATH.htm  THOUGHTS ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://stellamariscollege.org/documents/icaml.pdf  INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON APPLICABLE MATHEMATICS (ICAM-2016).] The  Department  of  Mathematics,  Stella  Maris College.&lt;/ref&gt; With this outlook, the terms applied mathematics and applicable mathematics are thus interchangeable.

===Other disciplines===
The line between applied mathematics and specific areas of application is often blurred.  Many universities teach mathematical and statistical courses outside the respective departments, in departments and areas including business, [[engineering]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[psychology]], [[biology]], [[computer science]], [[scientific computation]], and [[mathematical physics]].

'''Ass to mouth''' (commonly abbreviated as A2M or ATM) is a [[slang]] term primarily used to describe the withdrawal of a [[Human penis|penis]] from the receptive partner's [[Human anus|anus]] followed by the immediate insertion into the receptive partner's mouth.&lt;ref name="UTexas"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/%7Erjensen/freelance/justajohn.pdf | author=Robert Jensen, Ph.D. | format=PDF | publisher=The University of Texas at Austin | title=Just a John | accessdate=2007-01-08 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510153508/http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~rjensen/freelance/justajohn.pdf | archive-date=2008-05-10 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the recipient of ass-to-mouth is performing [[fellatio]] on a penis or object that was removed from his/her own rectum, the health risks are generally limited to disturbances of the gastrointestinal tract, which may proceed from introducing normal intestinal flora from the rectum to the mouth and upper digestive tract.

{{Chinese martial arts}}

'''Baguazhang''' ({{zh-cp|c=八卦掌|p=Bāguà Zhǎng}}) is one of the three main [[Chinese martial arts]] of the [[Wudang chuan|Wudang]] school, the other two being [[Taijiquan]] and [[Xing Yi Quan]]. It is more broadly grouped as an internal practice (or [[neijia|neijia quan]]). ''Bāguà zhǎng'' literally means "eight trigram palm," referring to the [[Bagua|trigrams]] of the ''[[I Ching]]'' (''Yijing''), one of the canons of [[Taoism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
The creation of Baguazhang, as a formalised martial art, is attributed to [[Dong Haichuan]] (董海川), who is said to have learned from Taoist and Buddhist masters in the mountains of rural [[China]] during the early 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Yintao, Fei and Yuliang, Fei. “Classical Baguazhang Volume IV: Wudang Baguazhang.” Trans. Joseph Crandall. Pinole, California: Smiling Tiger Martial Arts 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Chinese authorities do not accept the Buddhist origin, instead maintaining that those teachers were purely Taoist in origin, the evidence lying in Baguazhang's frequent reference to core concepts central to [[Taoism]], such as [[Yin and yang|Yin and Yang]] theory, [[I Ching]] and Taoism's most distinctive paradigm, the [[Bagua]] diagram.&lt;ref&gt;Liang Shou-yu, Yang Jwing-Ming, Wu Wen-Ching, “Baguazhang: Emei Baguazhang Theory and Applications” 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Allen, Tina Chunna Zhang, “The Whirling Circles of Ba Gua Zhang: The Art and Legends of the Eight Trigram Palm 2007” .&lt;/ref&gt; The attribution to Buddhist teachers came from the 2nd generation teachers, i.e. Dong Haichuan's students, some of whom were Buddhist. There is evidence to suggest a synthesis of several pre-existing martial arts taught and practised in the region in which Dong Haichuan lived, combined with Taoist circle walking. Through his work as a servant in the Imperial Palace he impressed the emperor with his graceful movements and fighting skill, and became an instructor and a bodyguard to the court.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Green, Thomas A. "Martial Arts of the World" 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Dong Haichuan taught for many years in [[Beijing]], eventually earning patronage by the Imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;Jingru, Liu and Youqing, Ma. “Classical Baguazhang Volume II: Cheng Shi Baguazhang (Cheng Family Baguazhang).” Trans. Joseph Crandall. Pinole, California: Smiling Tiger Martial Arts 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous disciples of Dong Haichuan to become teachers were [[Yin Fu]] (尹福), [[Cheng Tinghua]] (程廷華), [[Ma Gui (martial artist)|Ma Gui]] (马贵), Song Changrong (宋長榮), Liu Fengchun (劉鳳春), Ma Weiqi (馬維棋), Liu Baozhen (劉寶珍), [[Liang Zhenpu]] (梁振蒲) and Liu Dekuan (劉德寛). Although they were all students of the same teacher, their methods of training and expressions of palm techniques differed.&lt;ref name="Lie, Zhang 1995" /&gt; The Cheng and Liu styles are said to specialize in "pushing" the palms, Yin style is known for "threading" the palms, Song's followers practice "Plum Flower" (梅花 ''[[Prunus mume|Mei]] Hua'') palm technique and Ma style palms are known as "hammers." Some of Dong Haichuan's students, including Cheng Tinghua, participated in the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. In general, most bagua exponents today practice either the Yin (尹), Cheng (程), or Liang (梁) styles, although Fan (樊), Shi (史), Liu (劉), Fu (傅), and other styles also exist.  (The Liu style is a special case, in that it is rarely practiced alone, but as a complement to other styles). In addition, there are sub-styles of the above methods as well, such as the Sun (孫), Gao (高), and Jiang (姜) styles, which are sub-styles of Cheng method.

===Common aspects===
[[Image:250 Bagau016ChangChaoDong.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Internal martial arts|Internalist]] Zhang Zhaodong, also known as Zhang Zhankui.]]
The practice of circle walking, or "turning the circle", as it is sometimes called, is Baguazhang's characteristic method of stance and movement training. All forms of Baguazhang utilize circle walking as an integral part of training. Practitioners walk around the edge of the circle in various low stances, facing the center, and periodically change direction as they execute forms.&lt;ref&gt;Lie, Zhang. ''Classical Baguazhang Volume V: Yin Style Baguazhang.'' Trans. Joseph Crandall. Pinole, California: Smiling Tiger Martial Arts 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; For a beginner, the circle is six to twelve feet in diameter.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Students first learn flexibility and proper body alignment through the basic exercises, then move on to more complex forms and internal power mechanics.  Although the internal aspects of Baguazhang are similar to those of Xingyiquan and Taijiquan, they are distinct in nature.

[[Image:Baguadao (八卦刀).jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Fu Chen Sung|Fu Zhensong]] with a large bagua saber.]]
Many distinctive styles of weapons are contained within Baguazhang; some use concealment, like the "scholar's pen" or a pair of knives (the most elaborate, which are unique to the style, are the crescent-shaped [[deer horn knives]] (Chinese: 鹿角刀; pinyin: Lùjiǎodāo). Baguazhang is also known for practicing with extremely large weapons, such as the ''bāguà jian'' (八卦劍), or bagua sword, and the ''bāguà [[dāo]]'' (八卦刀), or bagua broadsword. Other, more conventional weapons are also used, such as the staff (''gun''), spear (''qiang''), cane (''guai''), hook sword (''gou'') and the straight, double-edged sword ([[jian]]). Baguazhang practitioners are also known for being able to use anything as a weapon using the principles of their art.

Baguazhang contains an extremely wide variety of techniques as well as weapons, including various strikes (with palm, fist, elbow, fingers, etc.), kicks, joint locks, throws, and distinctively evasive circular footwork. As such, Baguazhang is considered neither a purely striking nor a purely grappling martial art. Baguazhang practitioners are known for their ability to "flow" in and out of the way of objects.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} This is the source of the theory of being able to fight multiple attackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baguazhang's evasive nature is also shown by the practice of moving behind an attacker, so that the opponent cannot harm the practitioner.

Although the many branches of Baguazhang are often quite different from each other (some, like Cheng style, specialize in close-in wrestling and joint locks, while others, like some of the Yin styles, specialize in quick, long-range striking), all have circle walking, spiraling movement, and certain methods and techniques (piercing palms, crashing palms, etc.) in common.

Baguazhang's movements employ the whole body with smooth coiling and uncoiling actions, utilizing hand techniques, dynamic footwork, and throws.  Rapid-fire movements draw energy from the center of the abdomen. The circular stepping pattern also builds up [[centripetal force]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Bharat Mata.jpg|right|thumb|''Bharat Mata'' by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871-1951), a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and a pioneer of the movement]]
The '''Bengal School of Art''' commonly referred as '''Bengal School''',&lt;ref name=ngma/&gt; was an [[art movement]] and a style of [[Indian painting]] that originated in [[Bengal]], primarily [[Kolkata]] and [[Shantiniketan]], and flourished throughout [[India]] during the [[British Raj]] in the early 20th century. Also known as 'Indian style of painting' in its early days, it was associated with [[Indian nationalism]] ([[swadeshi]]) and led by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871-1951), but was also promoted and supported by British arts administrators like [[Ernest Binfield Havell|E. B. Havell]], the principal of the [[Government College of Art, Kolkata]] from 1896; eventually it led to the development of the [[modern Indian painting]].&lt;ref name=ngma/&gt;&lt;ref name=benartmitter&gt;{{cite book |title=Art and nationalism in colonial India, 1850-1922: occidental orientations |last=Mitter |first=Partha |authorlink= |author2= |year= 1994|publisher= Cambridge University Press|location= Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-44354-8 |chapter=How the past was salvaged by Swadeshi artists |pages=267–306 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mRTtkri8E0C |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=benartatlas&gt;{{cite book |title=Atlas of world art |last=Onians |first=John |authorlink= |author2= |year= 2004|publisher=Laurence King Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-85669-377-6 |page= 304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3h2KfXoOPYC |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Bengal}}
The Bengal school arose as an [[avant garde]] and nationalist movement reacting against the [[academic art]] styles previously promoted in India, both by Indian artists such as [[Raja Ravi Varma]] and in British art schools. Following the influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the [[Western world|West]], the British art teacher [[Ernest Binfield Havell]] attempted to reform the teaching methods at the [[Calcutta School of Art]] by encouraging students to imitate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitter|first=Partha |title=Indian art |url=https://books.google.com/?id=FHxsDV1GDOIC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=Ernest+Binfield+Havell+education#v=onepage&amp;q=Ernest%20Binfield%20Havell%20education&amp;f=false|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-284221-8|page=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ny"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/arts/design/20bose.html|title=Art Review: Indian Modernism via an Eclectic and Elusive Artist|last=Cotter|first=Holland|date=August 19, 2008|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move. Havell was supported by the artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]], a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]]. Tagore painted a number of works influenced by [[Mughal painting|Mughal art]], a style that he and Havell believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the "materialism" of the West. Tagore's best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. Tagore later attempted to develop links with Japanese artists as part of an aspiration to construct a [[pan-Asianism|pan-Asianist]] model of art. Through the paintings of 'Bharat Mata', Abanindranath established the pattern of patriotism. Painters and artists of Bengal school were [[Nandalal Bose]], M.A.R Chughtai, [[Sunayani Devi]] (sister of Abanindranath Tagore), [[Manishi Dey]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Kalipada Ghoshal]], [[Asit Kumar Haldar]], [[Sudhir Khastgir]], Kshitindranath Majumdar, [[Sughra Rababi]], [[D. P. Roy Choudhury|Debi Prasad Roychoudhury]], Bireswar Sen, [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]], Kiron Sinha,TP [[Gaganendranath Tagore]] (Tagore's brother)

The Bengal school's influence in India declined with the spread of [[modernist]] ideas in the 1920s. {{As of|2012}}, there has been a surge in interest in the Bengal school of art among scholars and connoisseurs.&lt;ref name=benarttoi&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-02-12/special-report/31051756_1_bengal-school-bengal-art-bengal-masters| title=For many art lovers, it's back to the old school| last=Ghose | first=Archana Khare |newspaper=Times of India| location=New Delhi|date=12 February 2012|accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
However, Bengal continues to produce some of the best artists of modern India. There is a department in the Government College Of Art &amp; Craft that has been training students the traditional style of tempera and wash painting for almost a century now. These students are carrying the legacy of the Bengal School artists, who, initially, were a group of artists, following Abanindranath's style and sharing his aesthetic vision. Among them, Dhirendranath Brahma is the living legend of the Bengal School of Art. He is a master of calligraphy and has innumerable students who are carrying on the tradition of Bengal School of painting. Among the other renowned artists of this style of painting are Ajoy Ghosh, Sankarlal Aich, Amal Chaklader, Narendranath De Sarkar, Sukti Subhra Pradhan &amp; Ratan Acharya. 
Some of the best known artists of present-day Bengal are [[Jogen Chowdhury]], [[Mrinal Kanti Das]], [[Gopal Sanyal]], [[Ganesh Pyne]], [[Manishi Dey]], [[Shanu Lahiri]], Ganesh Haloi &lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Shanu Lahiri dead|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130202/jsp/calcutta/story_16510654.jsp#.UUISlTeEnuo|newspaper=The Telegraph (Calcutta)|accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jahar Dasgupta]], Samir Aich, [[Bikash Bhattacharjee]], Sudip Roy, Ramananda Bandopadhyay and  [[Devajyoti Ray]].
Sanat Chatterjee is one of the last living pioneers of Bengal School of art. He studied under Asit Kumar Haldar for around fifteen years.

==R. Siva Kumar's disagreement ==
{{main article|Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism}}
[[R. Siva Kumar]], who has been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and their approach to art since the early 80s, refutes the practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the '''Bengal School of Art'''. According to Siva Kumar, 'This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice'.&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

His ideas on this issue are formulated in the catalogue essay of the exhibition [[Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism]].

In the late 1950s a number of European countries (most notably [[West Germany]] and France) decided on a migration policy known as the '''buffer theory'''.

Owing to rapid economic recovery in the post World War II period (aided by the American [[Marshall Plan|Marshall plan]]) there were many more job vacancies than people who were available or becoming available in the workforce to fill them. To resolve this situation they decided to "import" workers from the southern Mediterranean basin (including North Africa) on a temporary capacity to fill this labour shortfall.

These workers were invitees of the governments and came to Europe initially on the understanding that they could at any point in time in the future be repatriated if and when economic circumstances changed. These [[Gastarbeiter]] as they became known in Germany were mainly young unskilled males who very often left their families behind in their country of origin and migrated alone as 'Economic Migrant'. They worked predominantly in certain areas of the economy where working conditions were poorer than those of indigenous Germans and where the rates of pay were considerably lower. Ultimately they came to predominate in low paid service rated employment. The situation remained unchanged until the 1970s [[economic recession]].

Jobs were being lost in manufacturing and industry in particular but not necessarily in the occupational types in which the migrants worked. In 1974 the then West German government imposed a ban restricting any future economic migrants and offered the possibility of returning to their country of origin to many others, few migrants took up the offer and stayed at their jobs or began to receive unemployment assistance from the state. This led to increased tensions and feeling of resentment from many German people.

==Second wave of migration==

Throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s [[family reunification]] took place between Turkish migrants workers and their families. This reunification however took place in Germany rather than in Turkey. In a difficult economic climate after the [[1973 oil crisis]] it was generally believed by most Turks already in Germany that their economic circumstances would be measurably better there than back in Turkey at such a difficult time. The [[welfare state]] offered considerable financial support to all people within Germany including immigrants communities. The number of foreign residents therefore increased in absolute terms during this time period.

The German government's offer to repatriate people back to their home country was not very successful. This created a difficult situation for the German government which became increasingly worse as the number of immigrants swelled to their highest levels ever. Any resentment, hostility and bitterness already present between indigenous Germans and the Turkish community became progressively worse. This often culminated in physical attacks on immigrants, arson and overt racial discrimination. There was a feeling amongst Germans that "they have taken our jobs", but this situation only arose because of Germans themselves losing their jobs in industry and manufacturing in particular in the difficult economic situation post 1973. (NB This 'family reunification' corresponds with the second wave on the [[Everett S. Lee model of migration]]).

==Third wave of migration==
Dates to the period from 1989 onwards with the collapse of the [[Iron Curtain]] and the communist regimes in Eastern Europe. East Germans flooded into West Germany along with many ethnic Germans from central and eastern Europe. Germany accepted them as they were political refugees and very often [[asylum seekers]].

A '''buffer zone''' is generally a [[wikt:zone|zonal]] area that lies between two or more other areas (often, but not necessarily, [[country|countries]]), but depending on the type of buffer zone, the reason for it may be to segregate regions or to conjoin them.
Common types of buffer zones are [[demilitarized zone]]s, [[border zone]]s and certain restrictive easement zones and [[Green Belt|green belts]]. Such zones may be, but not necessarily be, comprised by a sovereign state, forming a [[buffer state]].

Buffer zones have various purposes, political or otherwise. They can be set up to prevent violence, protect the environment, protect residential and commercial zones from industrial accidents or natural disasters, keep prisoners intent on escaping from rapidly acquiring hostages or a hiding place, and have uses in several other scenarios. Buffer zones often result in large uninhabited regions which are themselves noteworthy in many increasingly developed or crowded parts of the world.{{examples|date=October 2013}}

== Conservation ==

For use in nature conservation, a buffer zone is often created to enhance the protection of areas under management for their [[biodiversity]] importance. The buffer zone of a [[protected area]] may be situated around the periphery of the region or may be a connecting zone within it which links two or more protected areas, therefore increasing their dynamics and conservation productivity. A buffer zone can also be one of the [[IUCN Protected Area Management Categories|protected area categories]] (e.g. category V or VI of IUCN Protected Area) or a classification scheme (e.g. NATURA 2000) depending on the conservation objective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biodiversitya-z.org/areas/10/ A-Z of Areas of Biodiversity Importance: Buffer Zones]&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'buffer zone' initially gained prominence in the conservation of natural and cultural heritage through its usage in the establishment of [[UNESCO]]'s World Heritage Convention, and the term was intended to be used as follows:

{{cquote|A buffer zone serves to provide an additional layer of protection to a [[World Heritage site|World Heritage property]]. The concept of a buffer zone was first included in the ''Operational Guidelines for the implementation of the World Heritage Convention'' in 1977. In the most current version of the ''Operational Guidelines'' of 2005 the inclusion of a buffer zone into a nomination of a site to the World Heritage List is strongly recommended but not mandatory.|cquote}}

|quote= Background and contents
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buffer zone is one of the [[Best management practice for water pollution|Best Management Practices]] (BMPs). A buffer zone is intended to avert the effect of negative environmental or human influences, whether or not it embodies great natural or cultural value itself.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Oliver, and Piatti, Giovanna (ed.) ''World Heritage and
Buffer Zones'', International Expert Meeting on World Heritage and Buffer Zones Davos, Switzerland 11 – 14 March 2008 (Paris: UNESCO, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The importance and function of a buffer zone and the necessary protective measures derived thereof is a relatively new concept in conservation science and can differ greatly for each site.&lt;ref&gt;Ebregt, Arthur and de Greve, Pol, ''Buffer Zones and their Management: Policy and Best Practices for Terrestrial Ecosystems in Developing Countries'' (Wageningen: Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecological functions (conservation) ==

=== Improve water quality ===
It shows that the quality of surface water in many countries is getting worse because humans do not use land properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=S. R.|last2=Caraco|first2=N. F.|last3=Correll|first3=D. L.|last4=Howarth|first4=R. W.|last5=Sharpley|first5=A. N.|last6=Smith|first6=V. H.|date=1998-08|title=Nonpoint Pollution of Surface Waters with Phosphorus and Nitrogen|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2641247|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=8|issue=3|pages=559|doi=10.2307/2641247|issn=1051-0761}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the buffer zone occupies a small area, it greatly improves the quality of water in the agricultural [[wikt:drainage basin|watershed]] due to its filtering effect on nutrients in the underground water and surface water. 

Because farmland is sprayed with large amounts of pesticides, some of which can seep into surface water. It will have a negative impact on fish and other aquatic life, which can lead to environmental damage. Vegetation buffer has been proved to be an effective filter for sediment, especially for sediment-bound pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Syversen|first=Nina|last2=Bechmann|first2=Marianne|date=2004-05|title=Vegetative buffer zones as pesticide filters for simulated surface runoff|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2004.05.002|journal=Ecological Engineering|volume=22|issue=3|pages=175–184|doi=10.1016/j.ecoleng.2004.05.002|issn=0925-8574}}&lt;/ref&gt; When pesticides are sprayed in excess, a vegetation buffer can be built to reduce the penetration of pesticides into surface water. The buffer zone also prevents heavy metals or toxins from spreading to [[Protected area|protected areas]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deroanne-Bauvin|first=J|last2=Delcarte|first2=E|last3=Impens|first3=R|date=1987-01|title=Monitoring of lead deposition near highway: A ten years study|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0048-9697(87)90447-5|journal=Science of The Total Environment|volume=59|pages=257–266|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(87)90447-5|issn=0048-9697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stabilize the riverbanks ===
When the riverbanks are low, due to the plant root can enter the interior of the riverbank vertically, the sediment of riverbank is affected by the action of plant root, and the ability to resist erosion is higher than that without plant root. But when the riverbanks are higher, the roots of the plants do not penetrate deeply into the soil, and the lakeshore soil is not very strong. Herbaceous plants can play a role to some extent, but in the long term, vegetation buffer zone can effectively solve the problem of water level rise and water erosion. 

The adsorption capacity of buffer zone can reduce the speed of surface runoff and increase the effective water content of soil. Through increasing soil organic matter content and improving soil structure, it has a positive effect on soil water storage performance. In addition, plant roots make the soil stronger, withstand waves and rainstorm, mitigate the erosion of riverbanks by [[Flood|floods]], and effectively control the erosion of the beach. 

=== Provide food and habitat to wildlife ===
The riparian buffer zones have been used in many areas to protect the habitats of many animals which are being devastated by increased human activity. The areas around the buffer zone can form the habitat of many animals, the woody parts and leaves of plants can become food for small [[Aquatic animal|aquatic animals]]. The buffer zone itself can also support the life activities of various [[Amphibian|amphibians]] and birds. Plants and animals can migrate or spread in response to these buffer zones and then increasing the biodiversity in the area. 

A study shows that the species and number of animals and plants in riparian zones are higher than in other ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sturtevant|first=Brian R|date=1998-10|title=A model of wetland vegetation dynamics in simulated beaver impoundments|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0304-3800(98)00079-9|journal=Ecological Modelling|volume=112|issue=2-3|pages=195–225|doi=10.1016/s0304-3800(98)00079-9|issn=0304-3800}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their ability to provide abundant water, soft soil and stable climate, small animals such as ''[[Mouse-eared bat|Myotis]]'' and ''[[Marten|Martes]]'' prefer to live along riverbanks rather than in hilly areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Doyle|first=A. T.|date=1990-02-20|title=Use of Riparian and Upland Habitats by Small Mammals|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1381312|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume=71|issue=1|pages=14–23|doi=10.2307/1381312|issn=1545-1542}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buffer zone can also provide a good environment for upland habitat, which is in line with the living conditions of freshwater [[Turtle|turtles]], making them more dependent on the wetland environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Vincent J.|last2=Gibbons|first2=J. Whitfield|date=1995-12|title=Terrestrial Buffer Zones and Wetland Conservation: A Case Study of Freshwater Turtles in a Carolina Bay|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09061365.x|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=9|issue=6|pages=1365–1369|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1995.09061365.x|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protection level of the buffer zones will affect the habitat range of amphibians and [[Reptile|reptiles]], and the environmental management of the wetland habitat around buffer zone is extremely important. 

=== Provide [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] value ===
As an important part of riparian zone, the vegetation buffer zones form a variety of [[landscape]], and the landscape pattern of combining land and water improves the aesthetic value of river basin landscape. The riparian buffer is rich in plant resources, and the wetland, grassland and forest ecosystem make the landscape more beautiful. In addition, some recreational facilities can be built in the buffer zone to provide better living conditions for residents or tourists and improve people's quality of life. 

In the buffer zone, those trees up to 6 meters tall greatly enhance the aesthetic value of the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Borin|first=Maurizio|last2=Passoni|first2=Matteo|last3=Thiene|first3=Mara|last4=Tempesta|first4=Tiziano|date=2010-01|title=Multiple functions of buffer strips in farming areas|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eja.2009.05.003|journal=European Journal of Agronomy|volume=32|issue=1|pages=103–111|doi=10.1016/j.eja.2009.05.003|issn=1161-0301}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tall trees have luxuriant branches and leaves, especially their upright posture, making them of higher ornamental value. Some colorful landscape tree species can be planted on both sides of rivers with tourism and sightseeing value to improve the aesthetic value of the place. The establishment of vegetation buffer zone can increase green land, improve forest coverage, beautify environment and visual effect, improve people's living environment, enrich humanistic landscape and enhance aesthetic value. we need to call on people to pay attention to the importance of the buffer zone, encourage local residents to participate in the protection and management of the buffer zone, and set up checkpoints around the buffer zone to make it more secure and effective.

The '''Chartist Mural''' was a [[mosaic]] mural designed by [[Kenneth Budd]] and created in 1978 in a [[pedestrian underpass]] in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], Wales.  It commemorated the [[Newport Rising]] of 1839, in which an estimated 22 demonstrators were killed by troops. It was {{convert|115|ft}} long and {{convert|13|ft}} high.  The mural was controversially destroyed in 2013 despite some public opposition and protests, before adjacent buildings were demolished to make way for the [[Friars Walk, Newport|Friars Walk]] redevelopment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title =Demolition of Newport Chartist Mural begins | url=http://www.itv.com/news/wales/update/2013-10-03/demolition-of-newport-chartist-mural-begins/ |publisher=ITV Wales |date=3 October 2013 |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The [[mural]] comprised 200,000 pieces of tile and glass.  It was designed by [[Kenneth Budd]] and erected in 1978 at an entrance to [[John Frost Square]], which had itself been created through redevelopment and named in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="documenting"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Pearson |first1 = Lynn F.|title = Public Art Since 1950| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JdP822ya3rYC&amp;pg=PA75 |publisher = Shire Publications|page = 75|year = 2006|isbn = 0-7478-0642-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mural celebrated the [[Chartism|Chartist]] uprising of 1839, when [[John Frost (Chartist)|John Frost]] led a march of thousands of protestors to the [[Westgate Hotel]] which was fired on by troops; some 22 demonstrators were killed.

Budd researched the Chartist rebellion for four months in consultation with experts at the [[Newport Museum and Art Gallery]].&lt;ref name="art"/&gt; He then created the mural in hundreds of square panels in [[Kent]] which were later assembled on site.&lt;ref name="BBC March 2012"&gt;Nick Dermody, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-17278034 "Newport Chartist mural artwork faces demolition"], BBC News, 13 March 2012.

* the Chartists' marching banners for the democratic demands of the Six Points of the [[People's Charter of 1838|People's Charter]] 
* their convergence on the Westgate Hotel to protest their demands

'''Cognitive behavioral training''' (CBTraining), sometimes referred to as structured cognitive behavioral training, ('''SCBT''') is a regimented cognitive-behavioral process that uses a systematic, highly structured workshop-style approach to break down and replace dysfunctional emotionally dependent behaviors. The roots of CBTraining lie in [[cognitive behavioral therapy]] (CBT), and like CBT the basic premise of CBTraining is that behavior is inextricably related to beliefs, thoughts and emotions.  However, CBTraining is delivered in a highly structured, regimented format and combines several other [[behavioral change theories]] and methodologies in addition to CBT. Cognitive behavioral training is currently used primarily in the [[behavioral health]] industry and in [[criminal psychology]].

==Difference from CBT==
Although CBTraining employs some similar foundational concepts that define Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, there are some fundamental differences between CBTraining and CBT, both in philosophy and in application.
CBTraining is training, not therapy. This is a critical distinction: unlike typical forms and applications of CBT, CBTraining is a process that is absolutely finite. That is to say, when a person begins taking a structured cognitive behavioral training course or program, there is already in place a set schedule – and therefore a predetermined end date – to training. Among one other main difference is the goal for a change in  
In CBT, as with most therapy, the patient plays a large role in determining the direction of the therapy, including the intensity and duration. An CBTraining course, or program, is usually broken up into a series of progressive, strategically ordered sessions – each one with a particular focus. CBTraining unfolds step by step, guiding the participant through the process of retraining the brain and dissolving the emotionally dependent thinking. Participants of SCBT take "classes," are quizzed, and are given "[[Homework in psychotherapy|homework]]". Much of the homework in CBTraining is based on [[writing therapy]]; as people write their emotional experience, their sense of trauma and stress is diminished. CBTraining is not tailored to the individual, it is tailored to the specific dependency it addresses. Cognitive behavioral training aims to create rapid change in the "students," is given in some sort of group or class form, and is governed by a prearranged pathway to change.
Cognitive Behavioral Skills Training has been used to teach and firmly implant social behavioral modification in children. Here is a concise explanation of a main difference between cognitive behavioral therapy and cognitive behavioral skills training: "...cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on how beliefs affect mood...skills training focuses on practicing pragmatic skills of living..."&lt;ref&gt;Granholm, Eric PhD. [http://www.learningrx.com/cognitive-behavioral-skills-training-faq.htm "Cognitive Behavioral Skills Training"]&lt;/ref&gt; CBTraining aims for swift and permanent implantation of new skills in living.

==Description==
Cognitive behavioral training (CBTraining) is a cognitive-based process designed with the aim to systematically break down emotionally driven dependencies and behaviors, replacing them with behaviors that are based on [[rational choice]]. Like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), the philosophy of CBTraining is rooted to one essential notion: feeling and thought are inextricably linked.

CBTraining contends that in any emotionally dependent relationship, people make emotional decisions rather than rational choices. When an emotionally dependent relationship occurs, it creates a belief-induced emotional state. When someone is in this state, they are incapable of making rational choices for more than a short period of time due to an emotion-driven subconscious process that overrides their conscious mind. This phenomenon explains why an overeater cannot resist having another bite... and another... and another, despite the fact that they are not physically hungry and they know that overeating is unhealthy.

CBTraining was born out of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and utilizes well established theories of psychology and treatment, including: [[bibliotherapy]], [[acceptance and commitment therapy]], behavioral self-control theory, behavioral economic theory, [[self-determination theory]], and [[motivational interviewing]]. Each of these methods plays a role in CBTraining, at varying stages of completion, in the common endeavor to bring a new sense of cognizant awareness in the participant.

Cognitive Behavioral Training, applied in a structured way (CBTraining), has also been used to deal effectively with women dealing with the stressors of having breast cancer  (e.g., changing thoughts about stressors ) in studies done at the University of Miami.&lt;ref&gt;Science Daily: Gallagher, Annette [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140516203346.htm "Cognitive behavioral or relaxation training helps women reduce distress during breast cancer treatment"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Willpower==
In addressing addictive behavior and other potentially destructive behavior compelling to the participant, CBTraining uses an approach of urge conditioning/desensitization. This approach stands in stark contrast to what is commonly most instinctive to people (urge avoidance), and seems counter-intuitive at first. The approach of urge desensitization has been applied to patients with gambling addictions, and research has shown it to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Psychiatry: Myongji Hospital, Goyang, Gyeonggi South Korea; Han C. Kim D. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24293014 "Desensitization of Triggers and Urge Reproducing for Pathological Gambling: A Case Series"]&lt;/ref&gt;
When a person is trying to quit smoking, for instance, the instinct is to remove all smoking paraphernalia from his presence. While this "out of sight, out of mind" approach seems to make sense, it does nothing to actually deal with the emotionally driven urge to smoke. CBTraining contends that, in fact, this white-knuckled method of willpower only lends the urge more power. With urge conditioning/desensitization, the participant is asked to actually create urges in order to become comfortable with having them. As the strategic format of CBTraining unfolds through the training, the urges are methodically stripped of their power. In acknowledging "urge", says CBTraining, you are actually acknowledging your power to choose.

Further distinguishing CBTraining from its closely related psychological predecessors is the inclusion of the concept of "Training" in place of "Therapy". CBTraining is a planned, intricately designed and systematically applied regimen that is purposely finite. CBTraining begins with a specific goal, and is constructed as a time-specific road map to achieving the goal. As a person undergoes the training, CBTraining aims to change not only this person's self-talk but his/her [[self-image]] at a subconscious level, so that the change in behavior is intrinsically motivated and willpower never really plays a part in it.

==History of development==

Along with CBT, CBTraining also owes some debt to [[Albert Ellis]]'s [[rational emotive behavior therapy]] (REBT), formerly known as Rational Emotive Therapy. REBT is classified as a form of CBT,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbtsearch.com/varying-forms-of-cbt/ |title=Different Types Of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy |accessdate=3 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is anchored by the belief that a person is "affected emotionally by his/her perspective and attitude about outside things." As with CBTraining, REBT incorporates Positive Self-Image Psychology.
Lou Ryan, a pioneer in the creation, development, and practical application of CBTraining, worked for some time under the guidance of Albert Ellis. In the early 1980s, Ryan, who was well-versed in Ellis's theories and philosophies, met Ellis in Hawaii after a series of seminars. Ellis recognized his own impact in Ryan's CBTraining programs, and played a peripheral part in some of the development.
According to Ryan when asked about the evolutional process of his particular philosophy: "I had collected a potpourri of different types of approaches, programs, and philosophies that I had come across through the years. To me, what seemed to be missing was vision. Vision for what people want from life is motivating but can often be lost in the daily trudge of life." About his time with Ellis, Ryan said: "I had met him at a conference in Hawaii. We met afterwards, and I told him what I was doing, that there were similarities between what we were doing. I asked him if he would review what I had put together, and for his input... he coached me on a few things. It occurred to me to add a structure to all of these philosophies."&lt;ref&gt;Live interview with Lou Ryan, San Diego CA, February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
Also involved in some of the early development of SCBT were John E. Martin&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.path4success.com/wp_PDF_files/BioJohnMartin.pdf Martin, Dr. John E]&lt;/ref&gt; and Scott T. Waters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Scott_Walters/ Walters, Dr. Scott T]&lt;/ref&gt; In a written critical evaluation of SCBT] is the strategic and effective use of techniques that exclusively target people who are ready to change now." They went on to say, in the same report, "...the rigidity of language and pacing might result in negative feelings towards a Training that gives so little choice itself."&lt;ref&gt;Martin, John E. PhD; Walters, Scott T. PhD."Evaluation of SelfHelpWorks Lifestyle Intervention Site: A Three Tiered Critical Analysis" August, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific applications==

CBT has been used most notably in two different spectrums: health and wellness, and criminal psychology (with the intention to minimize recidivism).

===Health and wellness===

CBTraining has been established to some degree in changing emotionally addictive behaviors related to tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;John Martin, Ph.D;David M. Young [http://operationsmokefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/OSF-Case-Studies.pdf "Comparison of American Cancer Society versus Internet Based treatment for Smokers"] February 2003 San Diego State University Graduate Research&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wooley, M.D.;John Whitlock, Ph.D [http://operationsmokefree.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/OSF-Case-Studies.pdf "Case Study #1 St. Lukes Hospital and Medical Center"] San Antonio TX, February 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  There is evidence that cognitive group behavioral training may be beneficial for patients with type 1 diabetes in their self-care.&lt;ref&gt;Diabetes Research Group [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15721974 "Cognitive Behavioral Group Training for Patients with Type 1 Diabetes"] March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; SCBT has been used to help people with diabetes manage their disease, with the primary goal being maintained lifestyle changes to slow or halt the progression of the disease. San Diego based SelfHelpWorks Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.selfhelpworks.com/corporate/scbt.aspx "SelfHelpWorks"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416175544/http://www.selfhelpworks.com/corporate/scbt.aspx |date=2014-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has incorporated SCBT as a core component of its behavioral training courses for smoking cessation, alcohol management, weight management, diabetes management, and stress management. Case studies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.selfhelpworks.com/corporate/science.aspx "Case Study: 390 Corporate Employees""Health Risk Assessment (HRA) Comparison"]&lt;/ref&gt; within the American workplace indicate the efficacy of CBTraining, however as of yet academic studies in this promising area are still relatively sparse.
Cognitive Behavioral Training has been used, combined with diet and exercise to reduce body weight and raise physical capacity in health care workers.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, J.R.; Faber, Anne; Ekner, Dorte; Overgaard, Kristian; Holtermann, Andreas; Sogaard, Karen [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/11/671 "Diet, physical exercise and cognitive behavioral training as a combined workplace based intervention to reduce body weight and increase physical capacity in health care workers - a randomized controlled trial."]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Addiction===

CBTraining has been perhaps most documented in its efficacy with addiction-related issues that involve substances such as food, alcohol and tobacco. Since the philosophy of CBTraining is that feeling is related to thought, and thought can lead to belief, it assumes that addiction in itself is at least partially dependent on the continued dysfunctional and oft-practiced thoughts and beliefs of the addict. Much of CBTraining is the encouragement to expand your "comfort zone" until the discomfort of physical withdrawal is no longer bothersome. For instance, when seasoned smokers decide to quit on their own, they typically consider it a matter of willpower, following the natural instinct to avoid cigarettes and "white knuckle" it. By contrast, CBTraining focuses on the cognitive aspects. It systematically applies a combination of techniques that makes the smoker consciously aware of the urge to smoke, explains the emotionally charged thought process that is really causing the urges, and brings the smoker to the point of purposefully creating urges while choosing the benefits of not smoking over the consequences of smoking in a way that no longer causes discomfort.

===Stress and anxiety===

SCBT contends that high levels of stress and anxiety are the practiced, subconscious choice of the mind. If stress is a feeling related to thought, and if thinking thoughts that produce stress is an unconscious habit, then this unconscious habit must first be made conscious to the patient. Once this is accomplished, the power to change thought, and hence feeling, is feasible.
In a nine-week "brief structured cognitive behavioral intervention" designed for family caregivers for persons diagnosed with [[Alzheimer's disease]], there was a reduction in stress and anxiety – "Moreover, these reductions in anxiety were maintained through a six-week follow-up period..."&lt;ref&gt;Rhonda L. Akkerman, Phd. [http://www.rosalynncarter.org/caregiver_intervention_database/dimentia/brief_structured_cognitive_behavioral_therapy/ "Brief Structured Cognitive Behavioral Therapy"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disease management===

SCBT has been used in helping diabetics manage their disease. Since [[diabetes]] is a disease that needs to be managed to a large degree by the patient himself/herself, much is dependent on the patient's lifestyle. In addition to producing a shift in mindset from living like a victim to living normally, SCBT has been used to help change pre-existing aversions to healthy living that are known to exacerbate the diabetic condition or, in the case of [[type 2 diabetes]], may even have brought it on in the first place.

In all areas CBTraining is applied to, there is maintained a key concept that when one is constantly aware of the power to choose, one will not be vulnerable to feelings of deprivation.

===In adolescents with behavior disorders===

A training program was developed and applied with the specific aim to increase self-control and reduce aggression in young people.&lt;ref&gt;Etscheidt, S.[http://www.childtrends.org/?programs=cognitive-behavioral-training-program-for-behaviorally-disordered-adolescents] "Reducing Aggressive Behavior and Improving Self-Control: A Cognitive-Behavioral Training Program for Behaviorally Disordered Adolescents."&lt;/ref&gt; Students were divided into six classes, with five students comprising each class.

There was also a study regarding the effectiveness of CBTraining in hyperactive boys in anger-inducing situations &lt;ref&gt;Hinshaw, S.P.; Henker, B; Whalen, C.K. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00913461 "Self-control in hyperactive boys in anger-inducing situations: Effects of cognitive-behavioral training and of methylphenidate"] Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology March 1984, Volume 12, Issue 1, pp 55–77 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00913461&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Criminal behavior===

Cognitive-behavioral programs developed for criminal offenders tend to focus on either [[cognitive deficits]] or [[cognitive distortions]]. Numerous studies have been conducted in correctional settings testing the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral techniques at reducing recidivism. Highly individualized one-on-one cognitive-behavioral therapy, provided by clinical psychologists or other mental health workers, is simply not practical on a large scale within our prison system. Therefore cognitive-behavioral therapies in correctional settings consist of highly structured treatments that are typically delivered to groups of 8 to 12 individuals in classroom-like settings.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, David B.; Bouffard, Leana Allen; Mackenzie, Doris L. [http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/32/2/172.short "A Quantitative Review of Structured, Group-Oriented, Cognitive-Behavioral Programs for Offenders"] Criminal Justice and Behavior April 2005 vol. 32 no. 2 172-204 http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/32/2/172.short)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods of access==

===In group/in person===
In the use of structured cognitive programs for convicted criminals to reduce [[recidivism]], the method was in person, and in group form.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, David B.; Bouffard, Leana Allen; Mackenzie, Doris L. [http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/32/2/172.short "A Quantitative Review of Structured, Group-Oriented, Cognitive-Behavioral Programs for Offenders"] Criminal Justice and Behavior April 2005 vol. 32 no. 2 172-204) http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/32/2/172.short)&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence that, when targeting this particular issue, SCBT has been used in any other format to date.

==Criticisms==
Although studies have been limited, initial data indicates that success with SCBT is largely dependent on the active, cooperative participation of the patient. The number one factor in inefficacy is failure to complete the training.
This essentially means that CBTraining, as it is presented in internet form, is geared towards participants who, in relation to the stages-of-change theory, are in the preparation and action stages.&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Mark S. MD [http://psychcentral.com/lib/stages-of-change/000265 "Stages of Change"] Psyche Central&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, CBTraining will be most effective when applied to people with a high motivation to change. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but it is an indicator of limitations. Simply put, SCBT is not likely to be effective treatment in someone who has no intention to change.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1837">In [[jazz]], a '''constant structure''' is a [[chord progression]] consisting of three or more [[chord (music)|chords]] of the same type or quality.&lt;ref name="Rawlins"&gt;Rawlins, Robert (2005). ''Jazzology: The Encyclopedia of Jazz Theory for All Musicians'', p.131. {{ISBN|0-634-08678-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Popularized by pianists [[Bill Evans]] and [[Herbie Hancock]], the combination of [[diatonic function|functional]] and nonfunctional chords provides cohesiveness while producing a free and shifting [[tonic (music)|tonal center]].&lt;ref name="Rawlins"/&gt;

[[File:Constant structure.png|thumb|center|400px|Constant structure example&lt;ref name="Rawlins"/&gt; {{audio|Constant structure.mid|Play}}.]]

For example, the progression F&lt;sup&gt;maj7&lt;/sup&gt;–A{{music|b}}&lt;sup&gt;maj7&lt;/sup&gt;–D{{music|b}}&lt;sup&gt;maj7&lt;/sup&gt;–G{{music|b}}&lt;sup&gt;maj7&lt;/sup&gt;–C&lt;sup&gt;13sus4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Rawlins"/&gt; contains four [[major seventh chord]]s (and one [[thirteenth chord]]), none of which are [[diatonic and chromatic|diatonic]] to the [[key (music)|key]] of F major except the first.

In contrast, the vi–ii–V–I or [[circle progression]] from classical theory contains four chords of two or three different qualities: major, minor, and possibly a [[dominant seventh chord]]; all of which, however, are diatonic to the key. Thus diversity is achieved within a stable and fixed tonal center.

'''Cross-cultural psychiatry''' (also known as '''transcultural psychiatry''' or '''cultural psychiatry''') is a branch of [[psychiatry]] concerned with the [[cultural]] context of [[mental disorder]]s and the challenges of addressing [[ethnic]] diversity in psychiatric services. It emerged as a coherent field from several strands of work, including surveys of the [[prevalence]] and form of disorders in different cultures or countries; the study of [[immigrant|migrant]] populations and ethnic diversity within countries; and analysis of psychiatry itself as a cultural product.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kirmayer LJ|chapter=Cultural psychiatry in historical perspective|editor1=Bhui, Kamaldeep|editor2=Bhugra, Dinesh|title=Textbook of cultural psychiatry|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|year=2007|pages= 3–19|isbn=0-521-85653-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early literature was associated with [[colonialism]] and with observations by asylum psychiatrists or anthropologists who tended to assume the universal applicability of Western psychiatric diagnostic categories. A seminal paper by [[Arthur Kleinman]] in 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0037-7856(77)90138-X|author=Kleinman AM|title=Depression, somatization and the "new cross-cultural psychiatry"|journal=Soc Sci Med|volume=11|issue=1|pages=3–10|date=January 1977|pmid=887955}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a renewed dialogue between [[anthropology]] and psychiatry, is seen as having heralded a "new cross-cultural psychiatry". However, Kleinman later pointed out that culture often became incorporated in only superficial ways, and that for example 90% of DSM-IV categories are culture-bound to North America and Western Europe, and yet the "[[culture-bound syndrome]]" label is only applied to "exotic" conditions outside Euro-American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.3109/10673229709030563|author=Kleinman A|title=Triumph or pyrrhic victory? The inclusion of culture in DSM-IV|journal=Harv Rev Psychiatry|volume=4|issue=6|pages=343–4|year=1997|pmid=9385013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Cultural psychiatry looks at whether psychiatric classifications of disorders are appropriate to different cultures or ethnic groups. It often argues that psychiatric illnesses represent social constructs as well as genuine medical conditions, and as such have social uses peculiar to the social groups in which they are created and legitimized. It studies psychiatric classifications in different cultures, whether informal (e.g. category terms used in different languages) or formal (for example the World Health Organization's [[ICD]], the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]], or the [[Chinese Society of Psychiatry]]'s [[CCMD]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0193-953X(05)70238-0|author=Lee S|title=From diversity to unity. The classification of mental disorders in 21st-century China|journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America|volume=24|issue=3|pages=421–31|date=September 2001|pmid=11593854}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The field has increasingly had to address the process of [[globalization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1363461506061761|author=Kirmayer LJ|title=Beyond the 'new cross-cultural psychiatry': cultural biology, discursive psychology and the ironies of globalization|journal=Transcult Psychiatry|volume=43|issue=1|pages=126–44|date=March 2006|pmid=16671396 |url=http://tps.sagepub.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said every city has a different culture and that the urban environment, and how people adapt or struggle to adapt to it, can play a crucial role in the onset or worsening of mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0193-953X(05)70249-5|vauthors=Caracci G, Mezzich JE|title=Culture and urban mental health|journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America|volume=24|issue=3|pages=581–93|date=September 2001|pmid=11593865}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some scholars developing an anthropology of mental illness (Lézé, 2014)&lt;ref&gt;* Lézé, Samuel (2014) "[https://www.academia.edu/3581444/Anthropology_of_mental_illness Anthropology of mental illness]", in : Andrew Scull (ed.), ''Cultural Sociology of Mental Illness : an A-to-Z Guide'', Sage, pp. 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; consider that attention to culture is not enough if it is decontextualized from historical events, and history in more general sense. An historical and politically informed perspective can counteract some of the risks related to promoting universalized 'global mental health' programs as well as the increasing hegemony of diagnostic categories such as PTSD (Didier Fassin and Richard Rechtman analyze this issue in their book 'The Empire of Trauma').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fassin|first1=Didier|last2=Rechtman|first2=Richard|title=The Empire of Trauma: An Inquiry into the Condition of Victimhood|year=2009|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton|isbn=9780691137537}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberto Beneduce, who devoted many years to research and clinical practice in West Africa (Mali, among the Dogon) and in Italy with migrants, strongly emphasizes this shift. Inspired by the thought of [[Frantz Fanon]], Beneduce points to forms of historical consciousness and selfhood as well as history-related suffering as central dimensions of a 'critical ethnopsychiatry' or 'critical transcultural psychiatry'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beneduce|first=Roberto|title=Etnopsichiatria. Sofferenza mentale e alterità fra Storia, dominio e cultura|year=2007|publisher=Carocci|location=Rome|isbn=8843035037}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beneduce|first=Roberto|title=Archeologie del Trauma.

==History==
As a named field within the larger discipline of psychiatry, cultural psychiatry has a relatively short history.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 1955, a program in transcultural psychiatry was established at McGill University in Montreal by Eric Wittkower from psychiatry and Jacob Fried from the department of anthropology. In 1957, at the International Psychiatric Congress in Zurich, Wittkower organized a meeting that was attended by psychiatrists from 20 countries, including many who became major contributors to the field of cultural psychiatry: Tsung-Yi Lin (Taiwan), Thomas Lambo (Nigeria), Morris Carstairs (Britain), Carlos Alberto Seguin (Peru) and Pow-Meng Yap (Hong Kong). The American Psychiatric Association established a Committee on Transcultural Psychiatry in 1964, followed by the Canadian Psychiatric Association in 1967. H.B.M. Murphy of McGill founded the [[World Psychiatric Association Section on Transcultural Psychiatry]] in 1970. By the mid-1970s there were active transcultural psychiatry societies in England, France, Italy and Cuba. There are several scientific journals devoted to cross-cultural issues: ''[[Transcultural Psychiatry]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.sagepub.com/|title=Transcultural Psychiatry: SAGE Journals|website=tps.sagepub.com|accessdate=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; (est. 1956, originally as ''Transcultural Psychiatric Research Review'', and now the official journal of the WPA Section on Transcultural Psychiatry), ''Psychopathologie Africaine'' (1965), ''Culture Medicine &amp; Psychiatry'' (1977), ''Curare'' (1978), and ''World Cultural Psychiatry Research Review'' (2006). [[The Foundation for Psychocultural Research|The Foundation for Psychocultural Research at UCLA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefpr.org|title=FPR|website=FPR|accessdate=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; has published an important volume on psychocultural aspects of trauma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521854288|editor1=Kirmayer, Laurence J.|editor2=Lemelson, Robert|editor3=Barad, Mark|title=Understanding Trauma|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2007|isbn=0-5218-5428-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently the landmark volumes entitled ''Formative Experiences: the Interaction of Caregiving, Culture, and Developmental Psychobiology'' edited by Carol Worthman, Paul Plotsky, Daniel Schechter and Constance Cummings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521895033|editor1=Worthman, Carol|editor2=Plotsky, Paul|editor3=Schechter, Daniel|editor4=Cummings, Constance|title=Formative Experiences|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=9780521854283}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Re-Visioning Psychiatry: Cultural Phenomenology, Critical Neuroscience, and Global Mental Health'' edited by Laurence J. Kirmayer, Robert Lemelson and Constance Cummings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9781316382813|editor1=Kirmayer, Laurence J.|editor2=Lemelson, Robert|editor3=Cummings, Constance|title=Re-Visioning Psychiatry|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9781316382813}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is argued that a cultural perspective can help psychiatrists become aware of the hidden assumptions and limitations of current psychiatric theory and practice and can identify new approaches appropriate for treating the increasingly diverse populations seen in psychiatric services around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kirmayer LJ, Minas H|title=The future of cultural psychiatry: an international perspective|journal=Can J Psychiatry|volume=45|issue=5|pages=438–46|date=June 2000|pmid=10900523}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent revision of the nosology of the [[American Psychiatric Association]], [[DSM-5]], includes a Cultural Formulation Interview that aims to help clinicians contextualize diagnostic assessment. A related approach to cultural assessment involves cultural consultation which works with interpreters and cultural brokers to develop a cultural formulation and treatment plan that can assist clinicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirmayer|first1=Laurence|last2=Guzder|first2=Jaswant|last3=Rousseau|first3=Cécile|title=Cultural Consultation: Encountering the Other in Mental Health Care|year=2014|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4614-7614-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
The main professional organizations devoted to the field are the WPA Section on Transcultural Psychiatry, the [[Society for the Study of Psychiatry and Culture]], and the [[World Association for Cultural Psychiatry]]. Many other mental health organizations have interest groups or sections devoted to issues of culture and mental health.

There are active research and training programs in cultural psychiatry at several academic centers around the world, notably the Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry at [[McGill University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/tcpsych|title=Division of Social and Transcultural Psychiatry|publisher=[[McGill University]]|website=www.mcgill.ca|accessdate=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harvard University]], the [[University of Toronto]], and [[University College London]]. Other organizations are devoted to cross-cultural adaptation of research and clinical methods. In 1993 the Transcultural Psychosocial Organization (TPO) was founded. The TPO has developed a system of intervention aimed at countries with little or no mental health care. They train local people to become mental health workers, often using people who previously have provided mental health guidance of some kind. The TPO provides training material that is adapted to local culture, language and distinct traumatic events that might have occurred in the region where the organization is operating. Avoiding Western approaches to mental health, the TPO sets up what becomes a local non-governmental organization that is self-sustainable, as well as economically and politically independent of any state. The TPO projects have been successful in both Uganda and Cambodia.

[[File:Giovanni Paolo Pannini 002.jpg|thumb|300px|''Roman ruins with a prophet'', by [[Giovanni Pannini]], 1751. The artistic cultural heritage of the [[Roman Empire]] served as a foundation for later [[Western culture]], particularly via the [[Renaissance]] and [[Neoclassicism]] (as exemplified here).]]
'''Cultural heritage''' is the legacy of physical artifacts and intangible attributes of a group or [[society]] that is inherited from past generations. 

Cultural heritage includes [[cultural property|tangible culture]] (such as buildings, monuments, landscapes, books, works of art, and artifacts), intangible culture (such as folklore, traditions, language, and knowledge), and natural heritage (including culturally significant landscapes, and [[biodiversity]]).&lt;ref&gt; Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl &lt;/ref&gt;

The deliberate act of keeping cultural heritage from the present for the future is known as [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|preservation]] (American English) or [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] (British English), though these terms may have more specific or technical meaning in the same contexts in the other dialect.

== The ethics and rationale of cultural preservation ==
Objects are a part of the study of human history because they provide a concrete basis for ideas, and can validate them. Their preservation demonstrates a recognition of the necessity of the past and of the things that tell its story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Tanselle| first =G. Thomas | publication-date = 1998 | title = Literature and Artifacts | publication-place =Charlottesville, VA | publisher =Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia | isbn = 1-883631-06-8 | oclc = 39223648 | year =1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Past is a Foreign Country'', [[David Lowenthal]] observes that preserved objects also validate [[memory|memories]]. While [[3D scanner|digital acquisition techniques]] can provide a technological solution that is able to acquire the shape and the appearance of artifacts with an unprecedented precision&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author1=Paolo Cignoni |author2=Roberto Scopigno |title=Sampled 3D models for CH applications: A viable and enabling new medium or just a technological exercise?|journal=ACM Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage |volume=1 | issue=1 |pages=1 |date=June 2008 |doi=10.1145/1367080.1367082| url=http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publications/2008/CS08/ | format=PDF |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in human history, the actuality of the object, as opposed to a reproduction, draws people in and gives them a literal way of touching the past. This unfortunately poses a danger as places and things are damaged by the hands of tourists, the light required to display them, and other risks of making an object known and available. The reality of this risk reinforces the fact that all artifacts are in a constant state of chemical transformation, so that what is considered to be preserved is actually changing – it is never as it once was.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Lowenthal| first =David | publication-date = 1985 | title = The Past is a Foreign Country | publication-place =New York | publisher =Cambridge University Press | isbn = 0-521-22415-2 | oclc = 12052097 | year =1985 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly changing is the value each generation may place on the past and on the artifacts that link it to the past.

Classical civilizations, and especially the Indian, have attributed supreme importance to the preservation of tradition. Its central idea was that social institutions, scientific knowledge and technological applications need to use a "heritage" as a "resource".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url =https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvdavns.org%2Fdata%2Fproposing_varanasi.pdf   | title =  Proposing Varanasi for the World Heritage List of UNESCO| publisher =  Varanasi Development Authority}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Using contemporary language, we could say that ancient Indians considered, as social resources, both economic assets (like natural resources and their exploitation structure) and factors promoting social integration (like institutions for the preservation of knowledge and for the maintenance of civil order).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Singh, Rana P.B., Vrinda Dar and S. Pravin  | title =Rationales for including Varanasi as heritage city in the UNESCO World Heritage List  | publisher = National Geographic Journal of India (varanasi) 2001, 47:177-200  }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ethics considered that what had been inherited should not be consumed, but should be handed over, possibly enriched, to successive generations. This was a moral imperative for all, except in the final life stage of [[sannyasa]].

What one generation considers "cultural heritage" may be rejected by the next generation, only to be revived by a subsequent generation.

==Types of heritage==

===Cultural property===
{{see also|Material culture}}
[[Cultural property]] includes the physical, or "tangible" cultural heritage, such as artworks. These are generally split into two groups of movable and immovable heritage. Immovable heritage includes building so (which themselves may include installed art such as organs, stained glass windows, and frescos), large industrial installations or other historic places and [[monument]]s. Moveable heritage includes books, documents, moveable artworks, machines, clothing, and other artifacts, that are considered worthy of preservation for the future. These include objects significant to the archaeology, architecture, science or technology of a specified culture.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Marie Sullivan, Cultural Heritage &amp; New Media: A Future for the Past, 15 J. MARSHALL REV. INTELL. PROP. L. 604 (2016) https://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1392&amp;context=ripl&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects and disciplines of the preservation and conservation of tangible culture include:
* [[Museology]]
* [[Archival science]]
* [[Conservation (cultural heritage)]]
** [[Art conservation]]
** [[Archaeological conservation]]
** [[Architectural conservation]]
** [[Film preservation]]
** [[Phonograph record#Preservation|Phonograph record preservation]]
* [[Digital preservation]]

===Intangible culture===
[[File:Anker Grossvater erzählt eine Geschichte 1884.jpg|thumb|''The Grandfather tells a story'', by [[Albert Anker]], ca. 1884.]]
{{main article|Intangible cultural heritage}}

"Intangible cultural heritage" consists of non-physical aspects of a particular culture, more often maintained by social customs during a specific period in history. The concept includes the ways and means of behavior in a society, and the often formal rules for operating in a particular cultural climate. These include social values and [[tradition]]s, [[convention (norm)|customs]] and practices, [[aesthetic]] and [[spirituality|spiritual]] beliefs, [[artistic expression]], [[language]] and other aspects of human activity. The significance of physical artifacts can be interpreted as an act against the backdrop of socioeconomic, political, ethnic, religious and philosophical values of a particular group of people. Naturally, intangible cultural heritage is more difficult to preserve than physical objects.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Aspects of the preservation and conservation of cultural intangibles include:

* [[folklore]]
* [[oral history]]
* [[language preservation]]

===Natural heritage===
{{See also|Conservation movement}}
"[[Natural heritage]]" is also an important part of a society's heritage, encompassing the [[countryside]] and natural environment, including [[flora (plants)|flora]] and [[fauna (animals)|fauna]], scientifically known as [[biodiversity]], as well as geological elements (including mineralogical, geomorphological, paleontological, etc.), scientifically known as [[geodiversity]]. These kind of heritage sites often serve as an important component in a country's [[tourist industry]], attracting many visitors from abroad as well as locally. Heritage can also include cultural landscapes (natural features that may have cultural attributes).

Aspects of the preservation and conservation of natural heritage include:
* [[Rare breed (agriculture)|Rare breeds conservation]]
* [[Heirloom plant]]s

==World heritage movement==
[[File:Plaque Carthage Unesco.JPG|thumb|175px|Plaque stating the designation of [[Carthage]] as a World Heritage Site.]]
Significant was the Convention Concerning the Protection of World Cultural and Natural Heritage that was adopted by the General Conference of [[UNESCO]] in 1972. As of 2011, there are 936 [[World Heritage Sites]]: 725 cultural, 183 natural, and 28 mixed properties, in 153 countries. Each of these sites is considered important to the international community.

The underwater cultural heritage is protected by the [[UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage]]. This convention is a legal instrument helping states parties to improve the protection of their underwater cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;[This convention is a legal instrument helping states parties to improve the protection of their underwater cultural heritage]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, UNESCO has begun designating [[masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]. The [[Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] sitting as part of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] with article 15 of its Covenant had sought to instill the principles under which cultural heritage is protected as part of a basic human right.

Key international documents and bodies include:
* [[Athens Charter (Preservation)|Athens Charter]], 1931
* [[Roerich Pact]], 1935
* [[Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict]], 1954, (with a definition of cultural heritage item adopted by some national law)
* [[Venice Charter]], 1964
* [[Barcelona Charter]], 2002 (regarding maritime vessel preservation)
* [[ICOMOS]]
* [[International Committee of the Blue Shield]] Managing natural and manmade disasters.
* [[International Institute for Conservation]]

'''''Ecology and Society''''' (formerly ''Conservation Ecology'') is a quarterly [[open access]] [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] [[scientific journal]] published by the [[Resilience Alliance]]. It covers an array of disciplines from the [[natural science]]s, social sciences, and the humanities concerned with the relationship between society and the life-supporting [[ecosystem]]s on which human well-being ultimately depends. The journal's editors are [[Carl Folke]] ([[Stockholm Resilience Centre]]) and Lance Gunderson ([[Emory University]]). [[C. S. Holling]] was the founding editor.

Issues are available online as "in progress" as soon as articles are published. Special features are published separately throughout the year.  Many of the articles in ''Ecology and Society'' are published as part of special features.  Much of the research from a social-ecological systems perspective is published in ''Ecology and Society'' .   Recent special features include "Understanding Human Resilience in the Context of Interconnected Health and Social Systems", "Advancing the Understanding of Behavior in Social-Ecological Systems: Results from Lab and Field Experiments", and "A Framework for Analyzing, Comparing, and Diagnosing Social-Ecological Systems."

According to the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]'', the journal has a 2016 [[impact factor]] of 2.8, and it ranks 20 of 105 journals in the field of Environmental Studies and 50 of 153 in the field of Ecology.&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite book |year=2014 |chapter=Ecology and Society |title=2014 Journal Citation Reports |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Science |accessdate=2017-09-27 |work=Web of Science |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Efez Celsus Library 5 RB.jpg|thumb|Personification of Episteme in [[Celsus Library]] in [[Ephesus]], Turkey.]]
"'''Episteme'''" is a philosophical term derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word [[wikt:ἐπιστήμη|ἐπιστήμη]] ''epistēmē'', which can refer to [[knowledge]], [[science]] or [[understanding]], and which comes from the verb {{lang|grc|ἐπίστασθαι}}, meaning "to know, to understand, or to be acquainted with".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|e)pisth/mh|ἐπιστήμη}}, {{LSJ|e)pi/stamai|ἐπίστασθαι|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Plato contrasts episteme with "[[doxa]]":&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|do/ca^|δόξα|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; common belief or opinion. Episteme is also distinguished from "[[techne]]":&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|te/xnh|τέχνη|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a craft or applied practice. The word "[[epistemology]]"  is derived from episteme.

== Western philosophy ==
=== Michel Foucault ===&lt;!-- 'Episteme (Foucault)' redirects here --&gt;
The French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] used the term ''épistémè'' in a specialized sense in his work ''[[The Order of Things]]'' to mean the historical, but non-temporal, ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' which grounds knowledge and its [[discourse]]s and thus represents the [[condition of possibility| condition of their possibility]] within a particular epoch. 

In subsequent writings, he made it clear that several ''épistémè'' may co-exist and interact at the same time, being parts of various power-knowledge systems. But he did not discard the concept:
{{Quote | I would define the episteme retrospectively as the strategic apparatus which permits of separating out from among all the statements which are possible those that will be acceptable within, I won’t say a scientific theory, but a field of scientificity, and which it is possible to say are true or false. The episteme is the ‘apparatus’ which makes possible the separation, not of the true from the false, but of what may from what may not be characterised as scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Michel | last = Foucault | title = Power/Knowledge | year = 1980 | page = 197}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yet in Foucault's ''The Order of Things'' he describes ''épistémè'' as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;However, if in any given culture and at any given moment, there is always only one episteme that defines the conditions of possibility of all knowledge, whether expressed in a theory or silently invested in a practice. (Foucault, 168)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Relation of the Foucaultian épistémè to Kuhn's ''paradigm'' ====
Foucault's use of ''épistémè'' has been asserted as being similar to [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s notion of a ''[[paradigm]]'', as for example by [[Jean Piaget]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jean | last = Piaget | title = Structuralism | origyear = 1968 | year = 1970 | page = 132}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are decisive differences. 

Whereas Kuhn's ''paradigm'' is an all-encompassing collection of beliefs and assumptions that result in the organization of scientific worldviews and practices, Foucault's ''episteme'' is not merely confined to science but to a wider range of discourse (all of science itself would fall under the ''episteme'' of the epoch). 

Kuhn's paradigm shifts are a consequence of a series of conscious decisions made by scientists to pursue a neglected set of questions. Foucault's ''episteme'' is something like the 'epistemological unconscious' of an era; the resultant configuration of knowledge of a particular ''episteme'' is, to Foucault, based on a set of primordial, fundamental assumptions that are so basic to the ''episteme'' that they're experientially "invisible" to the constituents (such as people, organizations, or systems) operating within the ''episteme.''

Moreover, Kuhn's concept corresponds to what Foucault calls ''theme'' or theory of a science, but Foucault analyzed how ''opposing'' theories and themes could ''co-exist'' within a science.{{Sfn | Foucault | 1969 | loc = ch. II.IV}}  Kuhn doesn't search for the conditions of possibility of opposing discourses within a science, but simply for the invariant dominant paradigm governing scientific research (supposing that ''one'' paradigm always ''is'' pervading, except under paradigmatic transition).  

Foucault attempts to demonstrate the constitutive limits of discourse, and in particular, the rules enabling their productivity; however, Foucault maintained that though [[ideology]] may infiltrate and form science, it need not do so: it must be demonstrated how [[ideology]] actually forms the science in question; contradictions and lack of objectivity is not an indicator of [[ideology]].{{Sfn | Foucault | 1969 | loc = ch. IV.VI.c}} &lt;blockquote&gt;"Truth is a thing of this world: it is produced only by virtue of multiple forms of constraint. And it induces regular effects of power. Each society has its regime of truth, its "general politics” of truth: that is, the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true; the mechanisms and instances which enable one to distinguish true and false statements, the means by which each is sanctioned; the techniques and procedures accorded value in the acquisition of truth; the status of those who are charged with saying what counts as true." &lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M. (1980): ‘Truth and Power’. In C. Gordon (ed.): ''Power/Knowledge. Selected Interviews &amp; Other Writings 1972-1977'' by Michel Foucault, Brighton: Havester, pp. 109-
133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rabinow, Paul (editor) ''The Foucault Reader: An introduction to Foucault’s thought''. (1991)  London, Penguin. 400 pages, {{ISBN|0140124861}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Kuhn's and Foucault's notions are possibly influenced by the French philosopher of science [[Gaston Bachelard]]'s notion of an "[[epistemological rupture]]", as indeed was Althusser.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

=== Judith Butler ===
In 1997, [[Judith Butler]] used the concept of episteme in her book ''[[Judith Butler#Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative (1997)|Excitable Speech]]'', examining the use of [[speech-act|speech-act theory]] for political purposes.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

'''Gender democracy''' is a [[normative]] idea related to [[gender mainstreaming]]. Its aim is to achieve democratic conditions between men and women within society as a whole, as well as specifically within companies, bureaucracies, and other organizations. Among other things, this is realized by means of [[gender training]]s that raise awareness of existing inequalities and develop methods to [[democratization|democratize]] relations between genders. The term gender democracy was first coined and developed by German [[sociology|sociologist]] Halina Bedkowski.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linksnet.de/de/artikel/18582 Jenseits von EMMA.

[[File:GuentherZ 2012-06-05 0068 Wien06 Johanna-Dohnal-Platz Strassentafel enthuellt.jpg|thumb|Street sign marking Vienna's Johanna-Dohnal-Platz. In 1993, the term "Geschlechterdemokratie" (gender democracy) appeared on the title of a publication edited by Johanna Dohnal - a first]]
According to Halina Bendkowski she developed the term and concept of gender democracy in the early 1990s during a "research trip to the US, which had been commissioned by Austria's Minister for Women, [[Johanna Dohal]], with the aim of identifying innovative projects against domestic violence."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linksnet.de/de/artikel/18582 Jenseits von EMMA. Oder: Wie werden das Wissen und die Diskussionen des Feminismus], ''UTOPIE kreativ.'' No. 158, Dezember 2003, pp. 1144–1146. The original German quotation reads: "...im Auftrag der österreichischen Frauenministerin Johanna Dohnal in den USA nach innovativen Projekten gegen häusliche Gewalt recherchierte"&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in 1993, the term appeared on the title of a publication edited by the [[Austrian Federal Ministry of Education and Women's Affairs]], "Test the West: Geschlechterdemokratie und Gewalt" (Test the West: Gender Democracy and Violence).&lt;ref&gt;Test the West: Geschlechterdemokratie und Gewalt (vol. 1 of "Gewalt gegen Frauen, Frauen gegen Gewalt"), ed. by Johanna Dohnal, Bundesministerin für Frauenangelegenheiten, Wien 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

The pioneers of gender democracy refused to provide a fixed and static definition of the term. Bedkowski stated: "As soon as a term has been defined in a dictionary and recycled by other theorists, it will have lost most of its vitality. It is true, terms are alive - and this is especially true for terms that have been developed in the course of actual political conflicts."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linksnet.de/de/artikel/18582 Jenseits von EMMA. Oder: Wie werden das Wissen und die Diskussionen des Feminismus], ''UTOPIE kreativ.'' No. 158, Dezember 2003, pp. 1144–1146. The original German quotation reads: "Sobald Begriffe lexikalisch erfasst und theorierecycelt sind, haben sie ihr vitales Leben schon meist hinter sich. Ja, auch Begriffe leben, besonders die, die für und in politischen Realauseinandersetzungen gewonnen worden sind."&lt;/ref&gt; Gunda Werner, who in 1999 outlined the basic tenets of gender democracy for the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]], explained: "Gender democracy has no ready-made theoretical or practical precepts. It is an exploratory movement in search of new outlooks and models."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwi-boell.de/sites/default/files/uploads/2014/04/zehn_thesen_von_gunda_werner_zu_geschlechterdemokratie_1999.pdf Gunda Werner: Geschlechterdemokratie 2000. Zehn Thesen zur Diskussion], PDF, October 1999The original German quotation reads: "Die Geschlechterdemokratie hat weder fertige praktische noch theoretische Konzepte. Sie ist eine Suchbewegung nach neuen Orientierungen und Modellen."&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, some of the fundamentals of gender democracy can be defined:

* Gender democracy is a normative precept, that is, an absolute moral and ethical [[axiom|postulate]].
* Gender democracy posits that the principles of democracy should not be limited to the sphere of politics but equally apply to the workplace and to personal life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwi-boell.de/en/2012/01/10/gender-democracy-goal-and-organisational-principle Gender democracy as a goal and an organisational principle], Gunda Werner Institute, January 2012. See the following statement: "Gender democracy must be realised on all levels of society: on a political, social and organisational level as well as on the level of everyday interactions. On a social and personal level this also means leaving behind structural patterns of hegemonic masculinity which continue to shape career paths and hierarchies in many companies and institutions."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals and methods ==

Gender democracy aims to achieve the equal participation of women and men in politics, the corporate world, and in all parts of society by reforming and abolishing undemocratic structures and all forms of power that are based on oppression and violence. This approach is based on a broad definition of democracy - one that demands equal rights and opportunities for people in all their diversity. As there is a large number of [[gender identity|gender identities]], gender democracy rejects the male // female [[dichotomy]], arguing instead that each human being - female, male, or otherwise - must have the right and the ability to self-determine their lifestyles, type of relationships in ways that go beyond stereotypical notions and any type of [[essentialism]] about men and women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwi-boell.de/en/2012/01/10/gender-democracy-goal-and-organisational-principle Gender democracy as a goal and an organisational principle], Gunda Werner Institute, January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender democracy investigates and questions structures and contents of democratic systems that were developed by men in order to transform them in ways that provide for gender equality. A key tool for implementing gender democracy are the so-called "gender traings" that aim to question traditional gender roles, analyze the social framework, and develop methods that provide for greater gender equality within organizations.

== Gender democracy within organizations ==

The following are some examples for organizations that have made gender democracy part of their institutional structures:

* The statutes of the [[Heinrich Böll Foundation]] define gender democracy as a "joint task"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.boell.de/de/1989/index-309.html Satzung der Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung] § 2(3) states: "Ein besonderes Anliegen ist ihr die Verwirklichung von Geschlechterdemokratie als ein von Abhängigkeit und Dominanz freies Verhältnis der Geschlechter. Diese Gemeinschaftsaufgabe ist sowohl für die interne Zusammenarbeit als auch für die öffentliche Tätigkeit aller Bereiche ein maßgebliches Leitbild." ('A prime objective is to make gender democracy a reality, that is, relations between the genders that are free of dependency and dominance. This joint task guides all aspects of our organizational development as well as our public activities.')&lt;/ref&gt;
* The German trade union [[ver.di]] has defined the "realization of gender democracy" as one of its aims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.verdi.de/++file++5073a207deb5011af9001810/download/ver.di-Satzung.pdf Satzung ver.di - Vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft] PDF, September 2015. § 5.3(f) states: "Zur Erreichung dieser Ziele dienen insbesondere: Verwirklichung der Geschlechterdemokratie und der gleichberechtigten Teilhabe von Frauen und Männern in Betrieb, Wirtschaft, Gesellschaft und Politik, auch unter Anwendung des Gender Mainstreaming." ('To achieve these aims, gender democracy and the equitable participation of women and men in the workplace, the business world, society, and politics has to be put into practice, including through the use of gender mainstreaming.'&lt;/ref&gt;
* The statutes of the German political party [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] contain a paragraph titled "gender democracy".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.die-linke.de/partei/dokumente/bundessatzung-der-partei-die-linke/2-die-basis-der-partei/10-geschlechterdemokratie/ Bundessatzung der Partei Die Linke. § 10 Geschlechterdemokratie]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Dog agility]]''' is now an international [[dog sport]] with many different sanctioning organizations and competitions worldwide.

== Agility in the United Kingdom ==
[[File:Jake-tyre-agility.jpg|thumb|280px|A [[Kollie]] taking part in an agility competition.]]

=== Eligibility for competition ===
Dogs of all sizes and origins are eligible to compete at agility shows in the UK, provided that they are:
*Registered with the show's organising body, where required
*A minimum of 18 months of age (16 months in UKA nursery classes)
*Not a bitch in season
*Not suffering from any infectious or contagious disease 	
*Not of such a temperament as to be a danger to the safety of any person or other animal
*Not in a physical condition that would cause suffering when competing

=== Kennel Club shows ===
[[File:Brittany dog liver.jpg|thumb|280px|Brittany dog taking part in an agility competition.]]
[[File:Bordercollie-ankc-agility.jpg|thumb|280px|A New Zealand red and white [[border collie]] competing in an [[ANKC]] agility competition.]]

[[File:German Shepherd Dog agility teeter.jpg|thumb|280px|A [[German Shepherd]] taking part in an agility competition.]]
Agility shows run by clubs that are affiliated to [[the Kennel Club]] continue to dominate the British agility scene. They host qualifiers for the most prestigious competitions at [[Crufts]] dog show near Birmingham each March, and [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] in London each December. They also provide a route for winning the three Championship classes needed to gain an agility dog the coveted 'Agility Champion' title.

Progression at KC shows is via a win-based system or a dog can progress on points if the handler chooses. Classes can number anything up to 450 dogs and class sizes vary considerably.  They can be as small as 4 or 5 dogs or as large as 200 dogs. If a larger number of entries is received for one class then the organising club will generally split the class into separate parts with a separate set of prizes for each part.  Generally classes for small and medium-sized dogs are smaller than for the large dogs. From January 2007, the KC has adopted a new [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930060358/http://www.agilityeye.co.uk/docs/Minutes-KCLC-AgilityCouncil-15Feb.pdf grading system]. Dogs with new handlers start in Grade 1 Elementary, and if they gain the wins required move up through Starters, Graduate, Novice, Intermediate and Senior to Grade 7 Advanced level. By the time a dog reaches Advanced (at which point it becomes eligible for Championship classes), it will have won many classes. The new grading system also provides the option to progress as far as Grade 5 Intermediate via a points system, run in conjunction with the Kennel Club's Agility Warrant (AW) agility titles.

The Kennel Club introduced its International Festival of Agility in 2005, a weekend event that hosts a range of national team and individual competitions and finals, including the British Open. The KC also funds the British agility team that is sent to the FCI world championships each year.

=== Other UK agility shows ===

The British Agility Association (BAA) was launched in 2006 Following the success of EMDAC (East Midlands Dog Agility Club which was the first Independent Agility Association in the UK founded in 2002 by June Bass &amp; Steve Retter) BAA provides its own progression system, with dogs being promoted via a ranking system based on performance at BAA shows. BAA shows are run both by the main EMDAC team and BAA affiliated independent clubs around the country. EMDAC host the BAA National Finals, a 3-day event in August each year.

UK Agility (UKA), launched in 2004, provides two separate progression programmes leading to agility titles. The Performance programme requires points to be gained in a range of Agility, Jumping and Games classes such as Gamblers and Snooker. This titling system has many similarities with that of the USDAA in the United States. The Steeplechase programme is based on Steeplechase classes consisting only of jumps and tunnels. UKA shows are run by both the main UKA team and affiliated independent clubs. UKA runs a weeklong show with its national championships in August each year, and also sends a team to the IFCS world championships.

In addition, a number of independent clubs and groups around the United Kingdom hold one-off shows or short series of shows that are not affiliated with any of the above organisations.

== Agility in Canada ==
In [[Canada]] dog agility is largely sanctioned by the Agility Association of Canada (AAC). In western Canada however, it is not uncommon to also see trials sanctioned by the North American Dog Agility Council (NADAC); in eastern Canada NADAC sanctioned trials are rare. Canadian Kennel Club (CKC) agility trials are uncommon and are mostly associated with specialty shows for purebreds in conjunction with other events.

== Agility in the United States ==
The first agility competition in the [[United States]] took place around 1986 under the rules of the newly formed [[United States Dog Agility Association]] (USDAA).

===Qualification for competition===
&lt;!-- Might be true in other countries, too, but I don't know for sure. -User:Elf --&gt;
For all organizations, dogs can compete provided that they are:
*Registered with the specific organization
*Physically sound (blindness, deafness &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akc.org/pdfs/rulebooks/REAGIL.pdf AKC Regulations]&lt;/ref&gt;, and physical impairments interfering with functional movement may disqualify a dog from eligibility; consult each organization for more specific information)
*At least the minimum age (for example, 15 months in AKC [http://www.akc.org/events/agility/jump_height_card.cfm] and CPE, 18 months in USDAA and NADAC)
*Not a female in heat (some venues allow bitches in season to compete, usually at the discretion of the hosting club)
*Well-behaved enough to be off leash around other dogs and people; for example, dogs who attack the judge, other people, or other dogs may be expelled from the trial site and may eventually be banned from competing

Dogs of any size, ancestry, or nationality can compete, except for in TDAA, which limits dogs to those of no more than 17" at the [[withers]]. On April 1, 2010, the AKC began allowing mixed breed dogs to compete in agility along with purebred dogs and dogs with a PAL/ILP listing.

===Agility titles and championships===
For most sanctioning organizations, there are a variety of titles that a dog and handler can earn by accruing sufficient qualifying runs—also called legs—that is, runs that have no more than a certain number of faults (typically none) and are faster than the maximum standard course time (SCT).

For example, under USDAA rules, a dog can earn novice-level titles in Standard, Jumpers, Gamblers, Snooker, and Pairs Relay classes by earning 3 qualifying runs in each of the classes; the dog can also earn intermediate-level titles and masters-level titles in the same classes. After earning all of the masters-level titles—five qualifying runs in each, with some that must be in the top 15% of dogs competing at each trial—the dog earns its Championship. Other organizations have similar schemes; in AKC, to earn the Championship, the dog's qualifying runs must be earned two at a time on the same day; in NADAC, the quantity of qualifying runs is much larger; and so on. Most champion titles have "CH" in the title: NATCH (NADAC Agility Trial Champion), ADCH (Agility Dog Champion for USDAA), CATCH (CPE Agility Trial Champion), MACH (Master Agility Champion for AKC), TACH (Teacup Agility Champion), ATCH (ASCA Agility Trial Champion) and so on.

===National championships===
[[File:Dogdalmatian jumping.jpg|thumb|280px|A dalmatian taking part in an agility competition.]]
In addition, each sanctioning organization holds its national championships each year. Dogs must meet certain minimum scoring requirements to qualify to compete in the annual championship; for example, the dog must earn qualifying scores in at least 50% of the runs at each of at least 3 trials during the year; or must place in the top certain percentage of dogs at certain trials; or must have a qualifying run in special regional qualifying events; and so on.

As with any agility competition, there are national champions in each height category because it is not  possible for dogs of greatly different sizes to compete equally.

====USDAA national championships====
USDAA has 12", 16", 22", and 26" (30, 40, 55, and 66&amp;nbsp;cm) jump-height categories; it crowns four national Grand Prix champions each year, as well as four Veterans and four Performance (lower-level performance) Grand Prix champions. It also holds championships for its Dog Agility Steeplechase and its Dog Agility Masters Three-Dog Team tournament series.

====AKC national championships====
To qualify for the AKC Dog Agility Nationals, dogs must obtain ''double Qs'' and points during the preceding year. (The exact number of each has been increasing each year - for 2008 it is 6 ''double Qs'' and 400 MACH points.)  A double Q means that the dog has earned  qualifying scores in both runs of a single day of competition. Points are earned by the number of seconds under the standard course time that the dog takes to run a course, and are multiplied by various factors based on placement. At Nationals, dogs compete against their height division of 8", 12", 16", 20", 24", or 26". The AKC Nationals are often televised.

The AKC also runs an annual breed invitational to represent the best dogs from each breed. The invitational qualification and competition are similar to those of the Nationals.

== International championships ==
Some competitions invite qualified entrants from multiple countries, thereby making them international championships. Examples include:

* [[Fédération Cynologique Internationale]] Agility World Championships, the oldest and best-known, is held every year. It had been held in Europe every year until 2013, where it is to be hosted by South Africa. The event was held as a European championship until 1995, then a world championship from 1996, and is restricted to registered pedigree dogs only. The FCI has more than 80 member countries (via each country's [[kennel club]]), over 30 of which typically take part in the FCI World Championships. The British, American and Canadian kennel clubs are not FCI members, but their teams are allowed to participate by special invitation.
* The International Mix &amp; Breed Championship in Agility (IMCA), first held in Italy in 2000 as a response to the FCI pedigree-only championships. The competition is held annually with about 18 countries participating, including teams from outside Europe. Now open to any breed or [[mixed-breed dog]] regardless of origins, and in Europe considered to be the main international rival to the FCI championships.
Since the 2002 IMCA (Gyula, Hungary), this championship is organised together with the ParAgility World Cup for disabled competitors.
* The International Federation of Cynological Sports (IFCS), has since 2002 organized a biannual world agility championship open to any breed or [[mixed-breed dog]] regardless of pedigree. English-speaking member or associate member countries include the United States (via the United States Dog Agility Association), the United Kingdom (via UK Agility), Canada (via the Agility Association of Canada), and Australia (via the Agility Dog Association of Australia). Ten countries participated in the event in 2006.
* The Cynosport World Games, officially named in 2003, as the consolidated venue for USDAA's three tournament series - ''Grand Prix of Dog Agility'', $10,000 ''Dog Agility Steeplechase'' and ''Dog Agility Masters'' Three-Dog Team Championship&amp;nbsp;— and exhibitions and competitions in other popular canine sports. USDAA tournaments were opened to invited overseas participants for the first time in 2001, which led to establishment of USDAA affiliates in other countries where qualifying events are now held each year. Prior to 2001, USDAA qualifying events were limited to Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico and the United States. The ''[[Cynosport World Games]]'' in 2006 attracted some 1,000 competitors in dog agility from twelve countries, and also now includes world championship events in flyball and flying disc. Participants from other countries may still apply for participation by invitation if USDAA qualifying events are not held in their country or region.
* The European Open. An informal annual championships since its foundation in 2002, open to all dogs regardless of origins. It rotates around a small number of countries in central Europe, though attracting competitors from all over Europe, with 25 countries due to participate in the 2006 event. From 2007, the competition will be held under Fédération Cynologique Internationale regulations, with a view to developing it into a 'World Open'. In years when the [[World Dog Show]] is held in Europe, the European Open will be held at the World Show and not separately.

'''Geoinformatics''' is the science and the technology which develops and uses [[information science]] infrastructure to address the problems of [[geography]], [[cartography]], [[geosciences]] and related branches of science and engineering.

==Overview==

Geoinformatics has been described as "the science and technology dealing with the structure and character of spatial information, its capture, its classification and qualification, its storage, processing, portrayal and dissemination, including the infrastructure necessary to secure optimal use of this information"&lt;ref&gt;P.L.N. Raju, Fundamentals of Geographic Information Systems&lt;/ref&gt; or "the art, science or technology dealing with the acquisition, storage, processing production, presentation and dissemination of geoinformation".&lt;ref&gt;M. Ehlers (2008) Geoinformatics and digital earth initiatives: a German perspective, International Journal of Digital Earth, 1:1, 17-30, DOI: 10.1080/17538940701781975&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geomatics]] is a similarly used term which encompasses geoinformatics, but geomatics focuses more so on [[surveying]]. Geoinformatics has at its core the technologies supporting the processes of acquiring, analyzing and visualizing spatial data. Both geomatics and geoinformatics include and rely heavily upon the theory and practical implications of [[geodesy]].

Geography and earth science increasingly rely on digital spatial data acquired from remotely sensed images analyzed by [[geographical information systems]] (GIS) and visualized on paper or the computer screen.&lt;ref&gt;Bouloucos and Brown, ITC Courses in Remote Sensing, GIS and Photogrammetry&lt;/ref&gt;

Geoinformatics combines geospatial analysis and modeling, development of geospatial databases, information systems design, human-computer interaction and both wired and wireless networking technologies. Geoinformatics uses [[geocomputation]] and [[geovisualization]] for analyzing [[geoinformation]].

Branches of geoinformatics include:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Research==

Research in this field is used to support global and local environmental, energy and security programs. The Geographic Information Science and Technology group of [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] is supported by various government departments and agencies including the [[United States Department of Energy]]. It is currently the only group in the [[United States Department of Energy National Laboratories|United States Department of Energy National Laboratory System]] to focus on advanced theory and application research in this field. There are also a lot of interdiscipline research involved in geoinformatics fields including computer science, information technology, software engineering, biogeography, geography, conservation, architecture, spatial analysis and reinformacement learning.

==Applications==

Many fields benefit from geoinformatics, including urban planning and land use management, in-car navigation systems, virtual globes, public health, local and national gazetteer management, environmental modeling and analysis, military, transport network planning and management, agriculture, meteorology and climate change, oceanography and coupled ocean and atmosphere modelling, business location planning, architecture and archeological reconstruction, telecommunications, criminology and crime simulation, aviation, biodiversity conservation and maritime transport.
The importance of the spatial dimension in assessing, monitoring and modelling various issues and problems related to sustainable management of natural resources is recognized all over the world. Geoinformatics becomes very important technology to decision-makers across a wide range of disciplines, industries, commercial sector, environmental agencies, local and national government, research, and academia, national survey and mapping organisations, International organisations, United Nations, emergency services, public health and epidemiology, crime mapping, transportation and infrastructure, information technology industries, GIS consulting firms, environmental management agencies), tourist industry, utility companies, market analysis and e-commerce, mineral exploration, etc. Many government and non government agencies started to use spatial data for managing their day-to-day activities.

'''Global Ocean Ecosystem Dynamics''' (GLOBEC) is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP) core project responsible for understanding how global change will affect the abundance, diversity and productivity of marine populations. The programme was initiated by [[Scientific Committee on Oceanic Research|SCOR]] and the IOC of [[UNESCO]] in 1991, to understand how global change will affect the abundance, [[biodiversity|diversity]] and productivity of marine populations comprising a major component of [[oceanic ecosystem]]s.

The aim of GLOBEC is to advance our understanding of the structure and functioning of the global ocean ecosystem, its major subsystems, and its response to physical forcing so that a capability can be developed to forecast the responses of the marine ecosystem to global change.

==Structure==
GLOBEC encompasses an integrated suite of research activities consisting of Regional Programmes, National Activities and cross-cutting research focal activities. The GLOBEC programme has been developed by the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) and is co-ordinated through the GLOBEC International Project Office (IPO).

'''Regional Programmes:'''
*Ecosystem Structure of Subarctic Seas (ESSAS)
*CLimate Impacts on Oceanic TOp Predators (CLIOTOP)
*[[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea|ICES]] Cod and Climate Change (CCC)

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''immediations''}}
'''''immediations''''' is an annual [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] in the [[history of art]], published by the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]], London.  The journal was established in 2004 by Louise Sørensen, John-Paul Stonard, and Linda Goddard.

''immediations'' covers research on any period in the history of art by current or recent members of the postgraduate community of the Courtauld Institute of Art. ''immediations'' also publishes interviews with art historians, artists, conservators and curators, and transcripts of events held at The Courtauld Institute of Art Research Forum.

In 2009, ''immediations'' initiated an occasional series of period-specific, themed volumes with ''immediations Conference Papers 1: Art and Nature, Studies in Medieval Art and Architecture'' ({{ISBN|978-1907485008}}), edited by Laura Cleaver, Kathryn Gerry, and Jim Harris.

2014 marked the journal's tenth year, celebrated by a series of events including a Conference on 17 January 2015 at the Courtauld Institute of Art. The conference featured past contributors and editors, who discussed their current research or the ways in which the trajectory of their careers in the art world reflected their original contributions to ''immediations''.

'''Institute of Chemical Technology''' ('''ICT'''), formerly the '''University Department of Chemical Technology''' ('''UDCT'''), is a [[chemical technology]] research university located in [[Mumbai]], [[India]]. The institute also has campuses at Jalna, Marathwada and Bhubaneshwar (in collaboration with IndianOil Corporation and IIT Kharagpur)  It is focused on training and research in various branches of [[chemical engineering]], [[chemical technology]], and [[pharmacy]]. It was established in 1933 and was granted [[deemed university]] status in 2008, making it the only state-funded deemed university in India.&lt;ref name="ictmumbai.edu.in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ictmumbai.edu.in|title=ICT Mumbai|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;On 12th February 2018 it was given status of Category 1 institute with graded autonomy by MHRD and UGC. It is also an institute with a special status as mentioned in SECTION IV of the Report of the Empowered Expert Committee in 2018.

==History==
The ICT was founded in 1933 as a University Department of Chemical Technology (UDCT) of the [[University of Mumbai]]. Robert Forster was first Head of the Department (1933–38), followed by [[K. Venkataraman]], who continued its development. It was considerably improved under the guidance of [[Man Mohan Sharma]]. The university conferred the autonomous status on the UDCT in 1994, with concurrence from the [[Maharashtra]] State Government and the UGC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ictmumbai.edu.in/DisplayPage.aspx?page=c&amp;ItemID=2|title=ICT Mumbai|website=www.ictmumbai.edu.in|access-date=30 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UDCT was renamed as the Mumbai University Institute of Chemical Technology (Autonomous) (MUICT) on 26 January 2002. In June 2004, in accordance with the Technical Education Quality Improvement Program (TEQIP) of the Government of India, under which the institute was selected as a Lead Institution, the Government of Maharashtra granted complete autonomy to the institute. On 12 September 2008, it was granted the [[deemed university]] status and renamed as the Institute of Chemical Technology.&lt;ref name="ictmumbai.edu.in" /&gt;

Institute of Chemical Technology was the first institute to be granted the elite badge by the government of the state of Maharashtra. This status put the institute on a par with other reputable schools such as the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]], [[Indian Institute of Science]] and the [[Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research]]. It also makes the institute, which has plans to set up a satellite campus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_matunga-college-plans-expansion_1504181 |title=Matunga college plans expansion - Mumbai - DNA |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date= |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; eligible for various special grants from the union and the state governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TNN |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-04-21/news/31378492_1_ict-phds-indian-institutes |title=Institute of Chemical Technology becomes 1st institute to get state's elite badge - Times Of India |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=21 April 2012 |accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Center on Small Hydro Power''' (ICSHP) is a non-profit institution operating under the auspices of the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO) to promote the development of [[small hydro power]]. The ICSHP is also the headquarters of the International Network on Small Hydro Power (INSHP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inshp.org/about.asp?BID=2|title=ICSHP About|publisher=ICSHP |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iecoafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=77&amp;Itemid=69|title=Hydropower organisations|publisher=www.iecoafrica.com |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
The ICSHP was formed in 1994 by the [[United Nations Development Program]] (UNDP) and the [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO) in co-operation with the Chinese Ministry of Water Resources and the Chinese Ministry of Commerce. Following approval from the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] in 1999 the ICSHP became the first international institution to be established in China. The following year an official agreement between the Chinese government brought the ICSHP directly under the auspices of UNIDO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inshp.org/about.asp?BID=2|title=ICSHP About|publisher=ICSHP |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://energypedia.info/wiki/Hydropower_-_International_Organisations#International_Association_for_Small_Hydro|title=International hydropower organisations|publisher=Energypedia |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its establishment has been described as 'one of the major achievements of China's reform and a symbol of world SHP demand, which reflects the international status of China's SHP development'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powermag.com/the-outlook-for-small-hydropower-in-china/?pagenum=7|title=The Outlook for Small Hydropower in China|publisher=www.powermag.com |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/money/jul/21china.htm|title=Chinese know how for small hydropower stations|publisher=[[Rediff]] |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The ICSHP was established 'to promote small hydropower development worldwide'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inshp.org/about.asp?BID=2|title=ICSHP About|publisher=ICSHP |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a specific focus on developing countries, south-south co-operation and the promotion of small hydro power for 'the social, economic and environmental development of rural areas'. The organisation provides training, advice, research and information exchange on small hydro power development and management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inshp.org/about.asp?BID=4|title=ICSHP Main Tasks|publisher=ICSHP |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the ICSHP is also in keeping with UNIDO's focus on promoting South-South Co-operation, 'by encouraging more horizontal investment flows'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Browne |first=Stephen |date=2012 |title=UNIDO: Industrial solutions for a sustainable future |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pw9PhbZ8jnEC&amp;printsec=copyright&amp;source=gbs_pub_info_r#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= [[Routledge]] |page= |isbn= |access-date=12/5/15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== World Small Hydro Power Development Report ==
In 2013 the ICSHP and UNIDO published the World Small Hydro Power Development Report. According to Li Yong, Director-General of UNIDO, the report was "a world first compilation of global small hydropower data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unido.org/news/press/first-launched.html|title=World Small Hydro Power Development Report 2013|publisher=UNIDO|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report assessed small hydro power development in 149 countries across 20 regions from over 60 different authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydroworld.com/articles/2013/11/unido-icshp-release-comprehensive-small-hydropower-study.html|title=UNIDO, ICSHP release comprehensive small hydropower study|publisher=www.hydroworld.com|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It found that while installed small hydro power was estimated at 75 GW, potential small hydro power was approximately 173 GW. Over 50% of the world's potential small hydro power was found to be in Asia however the report noted "It is possible in the future that more small hydropower potential might be identified both on the African and American continents". In 2015 it was announced that a second, updated edition of the report would be published in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inshp.org/article.asp?id=471|title=World Small Hydro Power Development Report 2016|publisher=ICSHP |accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy-l.iisd.org/news/unido-icshp-launch-small-hydropower-knowledge-sharing-portal|title=UNIDO, ICSHP Launch Small Hydropower Knowledge Sharing Portal|publisher=Sustainable Energy Policy and Practice|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energias-renovables.com/articulo/small-hydropower-a-promising-technology-for-rural-20130514|title=Small Hydropower, a promising technology for rural electrification|publisher=www.energias-renovables.com|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The community was founded by Dr. Victor Baranco (son of the Oakland jazz pianist [[Wilbert Baranco]]), a self-made millionaire who had achieved “the American dream” but was still looking for more in life.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One night in 1966 he deliberately examined his life and concluded that he and everything in the world were perfect and that he was responsible for everything that had happened to him.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Based on this realization, in 1968 he conceived of the Morehouse lifestyle as one in which people could live together pleasurably without doing anything they didn’t want to do,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.maxim.com/maxim-man/how-to-free-love-commune-neil-strauss-2018-6|title=INSIDE THE WORLD'S LONGEST-RUNNING, MOST SUCCESSFUL FREE LOVE COMMUNE|last=Strauss|first=Neil|date=17 June 2018|work=Maxim|access-date=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://livingexperiment.com/resistance/|title=Resistance to Pleasure|last=Gerasimo|first=Pilar|date=|website=The Living Experiment|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while serving the world unselfishly and profiting by it.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Since its inception, Lafayette Morehouse has conducted extensive research in how a group can live together pleasurably,&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; including groups as small as two, focusing on topics such as lifestyles, communication, coupled relationships, and sensuality.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=We’re Just People’ At More University|last=Dewolk|first=Roland|date=|work=Contra Costa Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While sensuality was only one among many areas of investigation, this was the topic for which the group became best known.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Their investigations of female equality and the importance of the clitoris in female orgasm were pioneering in the late 1960s and 1970s, and these findings were sometimes sensationalized in the press.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The group gained notoriety for the 1976 public demonstrations of a woman in continuous orgasm for three hours, which it claims were the first known demonstrations of that kind. The group has since trained many people to this standard.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

The findings of their social experiments were initially presented as courses under the auspices of the Institute of Human Abilities.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In 1977 the State of California adopted laws to encourage and regulate new educational institutions, and More University was created as a DBA of Lafayette Morehouse Inc., a for-profit corporation that had been formed in 1972.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafayettemorehouse.com/more-university.html|title=More University|last=|first=|date=|website=Lafayette Morehouse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; More University was authorized to grant bachelor of humanities degrees, master’s degrees in communication, as well as doctoral degrees in lifestyles and sensuality, with the faculty drawn from senior members of the group.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archives.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/purple-haze/Content?oid=2132347|title=Purple Haze A speedy tour of the Morehouse commune|last=Boulware|first=Jack|date=23 August 1995|work=SF Weekly|access-date=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/49248350|title=Planet medicine|last=1944-|first=Grossinger, Richard,|date=2000|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=1556433913|edition= Rev., 7th|location=Berkeley, Calif.|oclc=49248350}}&lt;/ref&gt; It completely complied with the California Private Postsecondary Education Act of 1977 as a “State Authorized” university.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031203150354/http://www.bppve.ca.gov/reform_act/index.html Private Postsecondary and Vocational Reform Act of 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; Although criticized as a “diploma mill,” over a 20-year period it granted degrees to fewer than 90 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=No More Degrees, state orders School.|last=Edwards|first=Katherine|date=5 November 1996|work=Contra Costa Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, responding to a change in the law, Lafayette Morehouse declined to pursue recertification of the University under the new rules, and More University was dissolved.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; No further degrees were granted and the group resumed doing business as Lafayette Morehouse, with much of the same curriculum.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beneteau: A brief history &amp; resource guide"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.trellishouse.org/lafayette-morehouse/|title=A brief history &amp; resource guide|website=Lafayette Morehouse and Victor Baranco|last=Beneteau|first=Marc|series=Adventures in Relationship and Community|access-date=2018-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years a substantial number of communal living experiments using Morehouse principles have been conducted.{{refn|group=note|name="quantity"|Sources have estimated between 30 and 100 such communities existed at the peak in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beneteau: A brief history &amp; resource guide" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":30"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/sgt-bilko-meets-the-new-culture-19711209|title=Sgt Bilko Meets the New Culture|last=Green|first=Robin|date=9 Dec 1971|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Most of these have been in northern California,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; but related communities have also been located in New York,&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/what-this-66-year-old-model-learned-on-a-commune-women-bring-the-joy-to-the-table-172820996.html|title=66-Year-Old Model on Her Unconventional Beauty, Hedonistic Commune Life|last=Greenfield|first=Beth|date=8 March 2017|website=Yahoo!

== Life in the Community ==
The everyday goal is to live pleasurably with one’s friends.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; The group has found that people who live deliberately and with awareness enjoy more fun relationships, which have tended to endure and deepen in intimacy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Residents pursue their individual goals with the support of the group.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Residents also share group goals and participate in group activities, such as maintenance of the property, entertaining family and friends, putting on courses and holiday celebrations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

People have their own money and make contributions to communal expenses, goals, and projects.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some residents have jobs outside of Morehouse.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

One group goal is taking care of the less fortunate.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Residents are encouraged to include this as an ongoing part of their lives, according to the viewpoint that the best life includes serving the world unselfishly.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

According to their website, “There is no label regarding sexual choices that applies across the board for our group. Sexual preference is a personal choice. Some people here are celibate, many are monogamous and some have more than one partner.”&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafayettemorehouse.com/faq.html#poly|title=Are you polyamorous?|last=|first=|date=|website=Lafayette Morehouse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents adhere to a strict sexual health screening program, begun in the late 1970s, to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafayettemorehouse.com/faq.html#std|title=How do you maintain the sexual health of your community in this age of STDs that are incurable or potentially fatal?|last=|first=|date=|website=Lafayette Morehouse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The political expression of the More philosophy is called the one no-vote, a decision-making system in which any participant, regardless of age, gender, time with the community, or any other factor can cast an irrevocable “no-vote” which stops any proposed new action.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lafayettemorehouse.com/one_no-vote.html|title=One no-vote|last=|first=|date=|website=Lafayette Morehouse|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This system is meant to encourage open communication and ensure that all voices are heard and considered before moving forward.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ic.org/directory/oakland-morehouse/|title=Oakland Morehouse|last=|first=|date=|website=Fellowship for Intentional Community|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business ==
The business of Lafayette Morehouse Inc. relies on word of mouth, without advertising.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The courses, in which research findings are presented, are held at various locations and produce income for communally-held goals, communal financial obligations and the ongoing research.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Course topics include pleasurable interpersonal relationships, effective communication, alternative lifestyles, jealousy, money, philosophical viewpoints on perfection, and a gratifying sensual life.&lt;ref name="Heller 2005 pp. 29-55" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; “It is not our goal to have others live as we do, but rather to offer our findings so that our students can use whatever elements they find beneficial. Those situations that all people encounter and must resolve in order to have happy, fulfilling lives are addressed in these courses.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

One source estimates that, as of 1997, over 100,000 people had taken at least one Lafayette Morehouse course, and over 1,000 people had lived in a Morehouse and participated in the social research.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Criticisms and Controversies ==
More University was criticized for not having the faculty and facilities of a conventional university.&lt;ref name="Billingsley-1994-p-13"&gt;{{Citation

One widely cited criticism of Victor Baranco and the Morehouse community was in David Felton's book ''Mindfuckers''.&lt;ref name=":24"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/516433|title=Mindfuckers; a source book on the rise of acid fascism in America, including material on Charles Manson, Mel Lyman, Victor Baranco, and their followers,|last=Felton.|first=David,|date=1972|publisher=Straight Arrow Books|others=Green, Robin., Dalton, David, 1945-|isbn=0879320389|location=[San Francisco]|oclc=516433}}&lt;/ref&gt; The section on Baranco was repackaged from two Rolling Stone articles, and the principle allegation was that he profited excessively by having group members pay to live in houses while renovating them.&lt;ref name=":30" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.trussel.com/lyman/guru.html|title=Beyond Shazam at Guru Gulch|last=Green|first=Robin|date=3 August 1972|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=3 June 2018|issue=114|pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that Jann Wenner, the editor of Rolling Stone, said the material on Baranco was written to personally attack Baranco.{{refn|group=note|name="hagan"|''[Jann Wenner,] in an Oedipal rage...attacked Baranco in the only way he knew how: He assigned writer Robin Green, his resident assassin, to profile him [Baranco] in Rolling Stone and "really expose him for the hustler he was."'' - in ''Sticky Fingers: The Life and Times of Jann Wenner'' by Joe Hagan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/987992115|title=Sticky fingers : the life and times of Jann Wenner and Rolling stone magazine|last=1971-|first=Hagan, Joe,|pages=253–254|isbn=9781101874370|edition= First |location=New York|oclc=987992115}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} These allegations against Baranco have not been repeated since 1972.

Many journalists have described Morehouse as a “sex commune”&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; or “sex cult,”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/style/article/Nicole-Daedone-s-mission-of-orgasmic-meditation-2368554.php|title=Nicole Daedone's mission of orgasmic meditation|last=Bowles|first=Nellie|date=12 June 2011|work=SF Gate|access-date=3 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on the group’s sexual research and courses taught on sexual topics.

The group has been criticized for having poor relationships with its neighbors.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Billingsley-1994-p-13" /&gt;  Most of these criticisms date to the period of time (1991 – 2000) in which the group opened its doors and provided food and shelter to a large number of homeless people as their guests, using military surplus tents.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Lawyers Open Morehouse Court Fight|last=Wasiczko|first=Donna|date=25 May 1994|work=Contra Costa Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neighbors were angered by the influx of unattractive people,&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; and the county sought to enforce zoning codes to end the activity. The group argued it was their right to use their own home to take care of people that were homeless.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; In an effort to mute extensive criticism in the press, the group undertook a lawsuit against the San Francisco Chronicle, which they lost. After a long court battle with Contra Costa County, Lafayette Morehouse was ordered to take down the tents.

'''Learning society''' is an educational philosophy advocated by the [[OECD]]&lt;ref&gt;OECD. (2000). “Knowledge Management in the Learning Society”. Paris: OECD Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[UNESCO]] that positions education as the key to a nation’s economic development, and holds that education should extend beyond [[formal learning]] (based in traditional educational institutions – schools, universities etc.) into [[informal learning]] centres to support a [[knowledge economy]] (known as a “world education culture”).&lt;ref name="Spring, J. 2009"&gt;Spring, J. (2009). “Globalization of Education: An Introduction”. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

A learning society regards the actual process of learning as an ‘activity, not a place’&lt;ref name="cisco.com"&gt;Cisco Systems Inc. (2010). “The Learning Society”. Retrieved September 14, 2010, from Cisco Systems Inc.: http://www.cisco.com/web/about/citizenship/socio-economic/docs/LearningSociety_WhitePaper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; – that is, it takes place outside of regular educational institutions, and is thus also decentralised and deregulated, a tenet of globalisation theory.

Learning societies are broader in context, drawing on elements of systems to facilitate the ability for [[lifelong learning]] in the individual. If lifelong learning is about the ability of the individual, then this is enabled through a Learning Society.

It is the ‘socialisation’ &lt;ref name="learndev.org"&gt;McClellan, J. (n.d.). “Envisioning Learning Societies Across Multiple Dimensions.” Retrieved September 13, 2010, from Learning Development Institute: http://www.learndev.org/dl/VS3-00g-LearnSocMultDim.PDF&lt;/ref&gt; of individual lifelong learning, and is currently aided through technologies and the increasing focus on social networking, by using the shared learning experiences of individuals as a basis for a larger network of education that exists formally and informally (schools, universities, job-training, support, collaboration, feedback etc.).

== History and theoretical framework ==
The history of the concept of the learning society can be traced through the chronological development of its theoretical framework. As the framework has developed overtime, so has the sophistication of the idea of the learning society as it applies to an inter-connected 21st-century model, particularly in relation to the shift from state-based educational institutions to more decentralised organisations.

In 1973, [[Donald Schön]]&lt;ref&gt;Schön, D. A. (1973). “Beyond the Stable State. Public and private learning in a changing society.” Harmondsworth: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; developed the idea that change is constant in a modern state (‘loss of the stable state’) and thus to adapt to this change, there must be a constant state of learning within the society of that state.
Further, [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]]&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, R. M. (1970). “The Learning Society”. Harmondsworth: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; also argued that given the ever-changing nature of states, particularly in business organisations, it wasn’t possible for educational institutions to keep up, or even be expected to. 
Later, Torsten Husén&lt;ref&gt;Husén, T. (1986). “The Learning Society Revisited.” Oxford: Pergamon.&lt;/ref&gt; and Stewart Ranson&lt;ref&gt;Ranson, S. (1998). “Inside the Learning Society.” London: Cassell.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasise that learning has a certain ‘fluidity’ (with no start or end points) that exists outside of formal systems and this seems to reflect a liberalised market model of free movements of knowledge as required by organisations and systems.&lt;ref name="Spring, J. 2009"/&gt;

Developing this framework to a more contemporary basis, it is seen that the requirement for a ‘learning society’ is a response to the broader issues of globalisation whereby richer countries have then become increasingly dependent on “knowledge workers” rather than traditional manufacturing industries (now often outsourced to developing nations), and thus need their workforces to become adaptable, particularly in light of new technological developments which are seen as central to the knowledge economy.&lt;ref name="Jarvis, P. 2000"&gt;Jarvis, P. (2000). “Globalisation, the learning society and comparative education.” Comparative Education , 36 (3), 343-355.&lt;/ref&gt;
With this model the concept of the learning society will be transplanted to other countries globally, much like any other product on a global market. This is in keeping with the philosophy of the World Bank that learning and education is central to improved development, justice, the environment and eradication of poverty (and thus global terror threats).&lt;ref name="learndev.org"/&gt;

== Relationship to lifelong learning ==
A learning society is generally considered to be the basis from which lifelong learning can take place.
From a theoretical standpoint, not only does the learning society provide the framework in which lifelong learning is allowed to flourish, but that in fact both elements mutually support each other. That is, a learning society gives rise to the capacity for lifelong learning, but lifelong learning allows, through socialisation, for individuals to contribute back to the learning abilities of broader society in the form of wisdom (known as a ‘koinosophic’ or ‘wise’ society).&lt;ref name="learndev.org"/&gt;

== Elements of learning societies ==
While the notion of the learning society can be sometimes difficult to grasp (relying as it does on concepts such as ‘fluidity’ and ‘informality’, and moving outside of traditional educative boundaries such as schools &amp; universities), some scholars believe that a learning society can be identified as having 4 main attributes.&lt;ref name="Jarvis, P. 2000"/&gt; These are:

=== Futuristic ===
This is described as the tendency of the learning society to have a dependency on technological advances. This can be regarded as the shifts towards knowledge economies in developed countries where the concept of the learning society is most prevalent, but also vitally as acknowledging the importance of the internet in allowing education to move beyond traditional boundaries and move across transnational borders instantly.&lt;ref name="Jarvis, P. 2000"/&gt;

=== Societal ===
This attribute is part of the broader conscious acknowledgement that is made by states and institutions that lifelong learning (as part of the learning society) exists specifically to contribute to the economic growth of a country and increase the democratic engagement of its citizens. Rather than being a general global shift towards an educational trend, it is aims towards specific outcomes that societies consider to be for their betterment.&lt;ref name="Jarvis, P. 2000"/&gt;

=== Reflexive ===
This attribute requires learning societies to recognise not just the role of lifelong learning within the broader community, but also to enable it to be adaptable to changes, and flexible to specific individual needs. These changes may come about as a result of technological advances, legislative amendments or personal preferences of the individual undertaking the education. According to Jarvis:
(italics)(indent) “...education will be but one more provider of information in the learning market and the educational qualification will become the public recognition of a private process.” &lt;ref name="Jarvis, P. 2000"/&gt;
(normal)(no indent) Thus, it will be the awareness of an individual’s ability to learn that will be of value, rather than what that individual has learned in the past.

=== Global market ===
The final attribute of a learning society requires that, like many products on a global market, education becomes a commodity and that students or participants in the learning process become consumers, able to pick and choose the types of education that they would like, to suit their own personal preferences. This would be facilitated through technological advances that allow students to access learning resources (and qualifications) globally. Under this attribute, education would then become tailored towards providing “customer satisfaction” to become economically justifiable.&lt;ref name="Jarvis, P. 2000"/&gt;

== Current models of learning societies today ==

=== Australia and UK ===
One of the most prevalent examples is the model of the [[Open University|Open Universities]], common in the UK and Australia. They allow students to work towards qualifications accredited by existing higher educational institutions but ‘cherry-pick’ the courses they have a preference for, while at the same time conducting their learning online.
This is best typified by a testimonial found on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100919132046/http://www.open.edu.au/public/home Open Universities Australia] website:
:''“Studying through OUA is very rewarding, particularly if you are a motivated and patient person. It also offers the flexibility that you simply can’t get with a brick-and-mortar university, which is definitely beneficial for some."'' – Open Universities Australia testimonial&lt;ref&gt;Open Universities Australia. (2010, September 10). “Future Students - Open Universities Australia.” Retrieved September 10, 2010, from Open Universities Australia: {{cite web |url=http://www.open.edu.au/public/future-students |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908063554/http://www.open.edu.au/public/future-students |archivedate=2010-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
In 1993, China aimed by the year 2000 to increase to 4% of GDP its spending on education in an effort to move the Chinese population towards being a learning society. It did not meet this target, but in 2009 resolved to meet the same goal by 2020 (which would total some US$200 billion in investment). This proposed investment would address reforms such as:&lt;ref name="chinaeducationblog.com"&gt;Quosdorf, F. (2010, June 14). "China defines road map for becoming a learning society by 2020." Retrieved October 1, 2010, from The China Education Blog: {{cite web |url=http://www.chinaeducationblog.com/education-reform-chinese-education-policy/2010-06-14/china-defines-road-map-for-becoming-a-learning-society-by-2020/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101001082619/http://www.chinaeducationblog.com/education-reform-chinese-education-policy/2010-06-14/china-defines-road-map-for-becoming-a-learning-society-by-2020/ |archivedate=2010-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increase private-public sector partnerships in pre-schools
* Increase global stature of universities and higher education institutions
* Improve education standards in rural areas
* Develop non-formal education facilities to allow for lifelong learning (i.e. distance learning, network building)
* Reform of nationwide examination programs
* Digitise learning processes through technology

=== United States ===
On the United States Department of Education website &lt;ref&gt;"United States Department of Education". Retrieved October 1, 2010, from the United States Department of Education: http://www.ed.gov&lt;/ref&gt; there is very little reference to the concept of the learning society. What does exist consists of Taiwan's EduCity of networked schools and classrooms in the National Education Technology Plan 2010&lt;ref name="ed.gov"&gt;United States Department of Education. (2010, May 14). "Support for a learning society." Retrieved October 1, 2010, from United States Department of Education: http://www.ed.gov/technology/netp-2010/support-learning-society-sb&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===
The concept of lifelong learning (as facilitated by a learning society) would allow for higher education to be undertaken at any stage of the students life (perhaps even on more than one occasion) rather than at the traditional undergraduate stage.

Based very much in the “world education culture” model”,&lt;ref name="Spring, J. 2009"/&gt; learning societies are seen as being central to competitive knowledge economy in a globalised world.
Advocates of learning societies see traditional institutions as no longer being central to lifelong learning. For example, transnational corporations such as Cisco believe that it will not come about simply through building more schools and universities. These organisations also advocate for the role of lifelong learning within their own structures.&lt;ref name="cisco.com"/&gt;

== Debates regarding learning societies &amp; higher education ==
Debates are argued addressing the role of how existing higher education institutions fit into the concept of the learning society. Despite the traditional argument that the learning society eschews traditional institutions, some advocates of the concept reaffirm the role of universities as being central to where the learning society begins and argue that “the university’s role in society is precisely to learn and understand itself and its environment...The more it addresses the concerns of society in its research, and the more it widens access to all members of society to benefit from the fruits of the research, the more it supports a genuine ‘learning society’” &lt;ref&gt;Laurillard, D. (1999). “A Conversational Framework for Individual Learning Applied to the 'Learning Organisation' and the 'Learning Society'”. Systems Research &amp; Behavioural Science , 16 (2), 113-122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, newly elected [[australians|Australian]] [[prime minister|Prime Minister]] [[Julia Gillard]] reflected the growing diversification of the education sector in her cabinet, by abandoning the role of a traditional ‘Education Minister’ and instead subsuming the role of higher education into a ministerial portfolio that also included jobs, skills and workplace relations – this move was criticised by many high-profile universities in Australia who argued that it undermined the central role of higher education as a place for learning in society.&lt;ref&gt;Tomazin, F. (2010, September 13). “Unis hit Gillard cabinet changes.” The Age , pp. http://www.theage.com.au/federal-election/unis-hit-gillard-cabinet-changes-20100912-15703.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, advocates of the ‘Learning Society’ also call upon partnerships between public and private enterprises to expand the scope of education to allow for more powerful educational learning experiences inside and outside of traditional institutions. These partnerships are seen to increase supplement funding levels (where inadequate public funds exists) as well as open traditional institutions and methods to technology and industry”.&lt;ref name="Spring, J. 2009"/&gt;

One criticism is that the learning society does not actually exist, but is simply a tool or theory invoked by powers (governments, IGO’s) to push certain agendas. This argument maintains that it is easy to see how the idea could be used to justify World Bank &amp; OECD programs in developing countries &lt;ref&gt;Hughes, C., &amp; Tight, M. (1995). “The Myth of the Learning Society”. British Journal of Education Studies , 43 (3), 290-304.&lt;/ref&gt; Or rather that it is nothing more than a vague term to describe an unfocused notion of 'learning on the internet'&lt;ref name="ed.gov"/&gt;

It is often difficult to find, despite the prevalence of the term ‘learning society’ amongst policy makers and politicians, information of real strategic funding from governments or corporations that reflect the theories and approaches of the learning society.&lt;ref&gt;Prof. Sackett, P. D. (2010, March 18). Preparing A Learning Society For The Future. Retrieved October 2, 2010, from Chief Scientist for Australia: http://www.chiefscientist.gov.au/wp-content/uploads/100318-CSMR-PMSEIC-final-Media-Release.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to questions being asked of the concept of the learning society, beyond ‘on-the-job’ training corporations may speak of the value of learning, but could it simply be another term for ‘flexibility’ on the part of employees? Is the term simply a term used to define current (yet inevitable) changes in education technology in an increasingly connected world? In the case of China's proposed improvements to their education system,&lt;ref name="chinaeducationblog.com"/&gt; it could be argued that much of the reforms are simply a timeline of general educational upgrades, rather than adhering to any particular philosophy unique to a 'learning society'.

Further, a lack of specificity can exist in much of the literature surrounding the learning society. For example, the Cisco white paper speaks of:
:''"...21st Century skills like collaboration, problem-solving and creativity..."''&lt;ref name="cisco.com"/&gt;
but how these particular skills are unique to the idea of a learning society (as opposed to learning generally) is not clear.

Further, there is criticism that standardisation of assessment and credentialing ignores the cultural differences between global communities, and thus erodes important distinctions that may allow learning and education to be effectively embedded in those cultures”.&lt;ref name="Spring, J. 2009"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13936">The '''MEMO model''' (version 6.2) is a [[Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates|Eulerian]] non-hydrostatic prognostic [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] model for wind-flow simulation. It was developed by the [[Aristotle University of Thessaloniki]] in collaboration with the [[Universität Karlsruhe]]. The MEMO Model together with the photochemical [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|dispersion model]] MARS are the two core models of the [[Europe]]an zooming model (EZM). This model belongs to the family of models designed for describing atmospheric transport phenomena in the local-to-regional scale, frequently referred to as mesoscale [[air pollution]] models.

==History==
Initially, EZM was developed for modelling the transport and chemical transformation of pollutants in selected European regions in the frame of the EUROTRAC sub-project EUMAC and therefore it was formerly called the EUMAC Zooming Model (EUROTRAC, 1992). EZM has evolved to be one of the most frequently applied mesoscale air pollution model systems in Europe. It has already been successfully applied for various European airsheds including the [[Upper Rhine]] valley and the areas of [[Basel]], [[Graz]], [[Barcelona]], [[Lisbon]], [[Madrid]], [[Milano]], [[London]], [[Cologne]], [[Lyon]], [[The Hague]], [[Athens]] ([[Nicolas Moussiopoulos|Moussiopoulos]], 1994; Moussiopoulos, 1995) and [[Thessaloniki]]. More details are to be found elsewhere (Moussiopoulos 1989), (Flassak 1990), (Moussiopoulos et al. 1993).

== Model equations ==
The prognostic mesoscale model MEMO describes the dynamics of the [[Planetary boundary layer|atmospheric boundary layer]]. In the present model version, air is assumed to be unsaturated. The model solves the [[continuity equation]], the [[momentum]] equations and several [[transport equation]]s for scalars (including the thermal energy equation and, as options, transport equations for water vapour, the turbulent kinetic energy and [[pollutant]]  concentrations).

== Transformation to terrain-following coordinates ==
The lower boundary of the model domain coincides with the ground. Because of the inhomogeneity of the terrain, it is not possible to impose boundary conditions at that boundary with respect to [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]]. Therefore, a transformation of the vertical coordinate to a terrain-following one is performed. Hence, the originally irregularly bounded physical domain is mapped onto one consisting of unit cubes.

== Numerical solution of the equation system ==
The discretized equations are solved numerically on a staggered grid, i.e. the scalar quantities &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; are defined at the cell centre while the velocity components &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; are defined at the centre of the appropriate interfaces. 

Temporal discretization of the prognostic equations is based on the explicit second order [[Linear multistep method#Adams.E2.80.93Bashforth methods|Adams-Bashforth scheme]]. There are two deviations from the Adams-Bashforth scheme: The first refers to the implicit treatment of the nonhydrostatic part of the mesoscale pressure perturbation &lt;math&gt;p_{{nh}}&lt;/math&gt;. To ensure non-divergence of the flow field, an elliptic equation is solved. The elliptic equation is derived from the continuity equation wherein velocity components are expressed in terms of &lt;math&gt;p_{{nh}}&lt;/math&gt;. Since the elliptic equation is derived from the discrete form of the continuity equation and the discrete form of the pressure gradient, conservativity is guaranteed (Flassak and Moussiopoulos, 1988). The discrete pressure equation is solved numerically with a fast elliptic solver in conjunction with a generalized conjugate gradient method. The fast elliptic solver is based on fast [[Fourier analysis]] in both horizontal directions and [[Gaussian elimination]] in the vertical direction (Moussiopoulos and Flassak, 1989).

The second deviation from the explicit treatment is related to the turbulent diffusion in vertical direction. In case of an explicit treatment of this term, the stability requirement may necessitate an unacceptable abridgement of the time increment. To avoid this, vertical turbulent diffusion is treated using the second order [[Crank–Nicolson method]].

On principle, advective terms can be computed using any suitable advection scheme. In the present version of MEMO, a 3D second-order total-variation-diminishing (TVD) scheme is implemented which is based on the 1D scheme proposed by Harten (1986). It achieves a fair (but not any) reduction of numerical diffusion, the solution being independent of the magnitude of the scalar (preserving transportivity).

== Parameterizations ==
Turbulence and radiative transfer are the most important physical processes that have to be parameterized in a prognostic mesoscale model. In the MEMO model, radiative transfer is calculated with an efficient scheme based on the emissivity method for longwave radiation and an implicit multilayer method for shortwave radiation (Moussiopoulos 1987).

The diffusion terms may be represented as the divergence of the corresponding fluxes. For turbulence parameterizations, K-theory is applied. In case of MEMO turbulence can be treated either with a zero-, one- or two-equation turbulence model. For most applications a one-equation model is used, where a conservation equation for the turbulent kinetic energy is solved.

== Initial and boundary conditions ==
In MEMO, initialization is performed with suitable diagnostic methods: a mass-consistent initial wind field is formulated using an objective analysis model and scalar fields are initialized using appropriate interpolating techniques (Kunz, R., 1991). Data needed to apply the diagnostic methods may be derived either from observations or from larger scale simulations.

Suitable boundary conditions have to be imposed for the wind velocity components &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;, the potential temperature &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; at all boundaries. At open boundaries, wave reflection and deformation may be minimized by the use of so-called ''radiation conditions'' (Orlanski 1976). 

According to the experience gained so far with the model MEMO, neglecting large scale environmental information might result in instabilities in case of simulations over longer time periods.

For the nonhydrostatic part of the mesoscale pressure perturbation, homogeneous [[Neumann boundary condition]]s are used at lateral boundaries. With these conditions, the wind velocity component perpendicular to the boundary remains unaffected by the  pressure change.

At the upper boundary, Neumann boundary conditions are imposed for the horizontal velocity components and the potential temperature. To ensure non-reflectivity, a radiative condition is used for the hydrostatic part of the mesoscale pressure perturbation 
&lt;math&gt;p_h&lt;/math&gt; at that boundary. Hence, vertically propagating internal gravity waves are allowed to leave the computational domain (Klemp and Durran 1983). For the nonhydrostatic part of the mesoscale pressure perturbation, homogeneous staggered [[Dirichlet conditions]] are imposed. Being justified by the fact that nonhydrostatic effects are negligible at large heights, this condition is necessary, if singularity of the elliptic pressure equation is to be avoided in view of the Neumann boundary conditions at all other boundaries.

The lower boundary coincides with the ground (or, more precisely, a height above ground corresponding to its aerodynamic roughness). For the non-hydrostatic part of the mesoscale pressure perturbation, inhomogeneous Neumann conditions are imposed at that boundary. All other conditions at the lower boundary follow from the assumption that the [[Monin–Obukhov length|–Obukhov]] similarity theory is valid.

The one way interactive nesting facility is possible within MEMO. Thus, successive simulations on grids of increasing resolution are possible. During these simulations, the results of the application to a coarse grid are used as boundary conditions for the application to the finer grid (Kunz and Moussiopoulos, 1995).

== Grid definition ==
The governing equations are solved numerically on a staggered grid. Scalar quantities as the temperature, pressure, density and also the cell volume are defined at the centre of a grid cell and the velocity components &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt; at the centre of the appropriate interface. Turbulent fluxes are defined at different locations: Shear fluxes are defined at the centre of the appropriate edges of a grid cell and normal stress fluxes at scalar points. With this definition, the outgoing fluxes of momentum, mass, heat and also turbulent fluxes of a grid cell are identical to incoming flux of the adjacent grid cell. So the numerical method is conservative.

== Topography and surface type ==
For calculations with MEMO, a file must be provided which contains orography height and surface type for each grid location The following surface types are distinguished and must be stored as percentage:

* water (type: 1)
* arid land (type: 2)
* few vegetation (type: 3)
* farmland (type: 4)
* forest (type: 5)
* suburban area (type: 6)
* urban area (type: 7)

Only surface types 1–6 have to be stored. Type 7 is the difference between 100% and the sum of types 1–6. If the percentage of a surface type is 100%, then write the number 10 and for all other surface types the number 99.

The [[orography]] height is the mean height for each grid location above sea level in meter. 

== Meteorological data ==
The prognostic model MEMO is a set of partial differential equations in three spatial directions and in time. To solve these equations,  information about the initial state in the whole domain and about the development of all relevant quantities at the lateral boundaries is required.

===Initial state===
To generate an initial state for the prognostic model, a diagnostic model (Kunz, R., 1991) is applied using measured temperature and wind data. Both data can be provided as:
* surface measurements i.e. single measurements directly above the surface (not necessary)
* upper air soundings (i.e., soundings that consist of two or more  measurements at different heights) at a constant geographical location is required (with at least one sounding for temperature and wind velocity).

===Time-dependent boundary conditions===
Information about quantities at the lateral boundaries can be taken into account as surface measurements and upper air soundings. Therefore, a key word and the time when boundary data is given must occur in front of a set of boundary information.

== Nesting facility ==
In MEMO, a one-way interactive nesting scheme is implemented. With this nesting scheme a coarse grid and a fine grid simulation can be nested. During the coarse grid simulation, data is interpolated and written to a file. A consecutive fine grid simulation uses this data as lateral boundary values.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19899">'''Molecular engineering''' is an emerging field of study concerned with the design and testing of molecular properties, behavior and interactions in order to assemble better materials, systems, and processes for specific functions. This approach, in which observable properties of a macroscopic system are influenced by direct alteration of a molecular structure, falls into the broader category of “bottom-up” design.

[[File:SizeVersusComplexity.png|thumb|Molecular engineering deals with material development efforts in emerging technologies that require rigorous rational molecular design approaches towards systems of high complexity.]]

Molecular engineering is highly interdisciplinary by nature, encompassing aspects of [[chemical engineering]], [[materials science]], [[Biological engineering|bioengineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[physics]], [[mechanical engineering]], and [[chemistry]]. There is also considerable overlap with [[nanotechnology]], in that both are concerned with the behavior of materials on the scale of nanometers or smaller. Given the highly fundamental nature of molecular interactions, there are a plethora of potential application areas, limited perhaps only by one’s imagination and the laws of physics. However, some of the early successes of molecular engineering have come in the fields of immunotherapy, synthetic biology, and printable electronics (see [[#Applications|molecular engineering applications]]).

Molecular engineering is a dynamic and evolving field with complex target problems; breakthroughs require sophisticated and creative engineers who are conversant across disciplines. A rational engineering methodology that is based on molecular principles is in contrast to the widespread trial-and-error approaches common throughout engineering disciplines. Rather than relying on well-described but poorly-understood empirical correlations between the makeup of a system and its properties, a molecular design approach seeks to manipulate system properties directly using an understanding of their chemical and physical origins. This often gives rise to fundamentally new materials and systems, which are required to address outstanding needs in numerous fields, from energy to healthcare to electronics. Additionally, with the increased sophistication of technology, trial-and-error approaches are often costly and difficult, as it may be difficult to account for all relevant dependencies among variables in a [[complex system]]. Molecular engineering efforts may include computational tools, experimental methods, or a combination of both.

==History==

Molecular engineering was first mentioned in the research literature in 1956 by [[Arthur R. von Hippel]], who defined it as "… a new mode of thinking about engineering problems.  Instead of taking prefabricated materials and trying to devise engineering applications consistent with their macroscopic properties, one builds materials from their atoms and molecules for the purpose at hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=von Hippel|first=Arthur R|date=1956|title=Molecular Engineering|jstor=1750067|journal=Science|volume=123|issue=3191|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was echoed in [[Richard Feynman|Richard Feynman’s]] seminal 1959 lecture ''[[There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom]]'', which is widely regarded as giving birth to some of the fundamental ideas of the field of [[nanotechnology]]. In spite of the early introduction of these concepts, it was not until the mid-1980s with the publication of ''[[Engines of Creation|Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology]]'' by [[K. Eric Drexler|Drexler]] that the modern concepts of nano and molecular-scale science began to grow in the public consciousness.

The discovery of electrically-conductive properties in [[polyacetylene]] by [[Alan J. Heeger]] in 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chiang|first=C. K.|date=1977-01-01|title=Electrical Conductivity in Doped Polyacetylene|url=http://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.39.1098|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=39|issue=17|pages=1098–1101|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.39.1098|bibcode=1977PhRvL..39.1098C}}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively opened the field of [[organic electronics]], which has proved foundational for many molecular engineering efforts. Design and optimization of these materials has led to a number of innovations including [[OLED|organic light-emitting diodes]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and [[Organic solar cell|flexible solar cells]].

==Applications==
Molecular design has been an important element of many disciplines in academia, including bioengineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, materials science, mechanical engineering and chemistry.  However, one of the ongoing challenges is in bringing together the critical mass of manpower amongst disciplines to span the realm from design theory to materials production, and from device design to product development.  Thus, while the concept of rational engineering of technology from the bottom-up is not new, it is still far from being widely translated into R&amp;D efforts.

Molecular engineering is used in many industries. Some applications of technologies where molecular engineering plays a critical role:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5534">'''Native-language identification''' ('''NLI''') is the task of determining an author's [[first language|native language]] (L1) based only on their writings in a [[second language]] (L2).&lt;ref&gt;Wong, Sze-Meng Jojo, and Mark Dras. [http://anthology.aclweb.org/D/D11/D11-1148.pdf "Exploiting parse structures for native language identification"]. Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing. Association for Computational Linguistics, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
NLI works through identifying language-usage patterns that are common to specific L1 groups and then applying this knowledge to predict the native language of previously unseen texts.
This is motivated in part by applications in [[second-language acquisition]], language teaching and [[forensic linguistics]], amongst others.

== Overview ==
NLI works under the assumption that an author's L1 will dispose them towards particular language production patterns in their L2, as influenced by their native language. This relates to cross-linguistic influence (CLI), a key topic in the field of second-language acquisition (SLA) that analyzes transfer effects from the L1 on later learned languages.

Using large-scale English data, NLI methods achieve over 80% accuracy in predicting the native language of texts written by authors from 11 different L1 backgrounds. This can be compared to a baseline of 9% for choosing randomly.

==Applications==

===Pedagogy and language transfer===
This identification of L1-specific features has been used to study [[language transfer]] effects in second-language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;Malmasi, Shervin, and Mark Dras. [http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D/D14/D14-1144.pdf "Language Transfer Hypotheses with Linear SVM Weights."] Proceedings of the 2014 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP). 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This is useful for developing pedagogical material, teaching methods, L1-specific instructions and generating learner feedback that is tailored to their native language.

===Forensic linguistics===
NLI methods can also be applied in [[forensic linguistics]] as a method of performing authorship profiling in order to infer the attributes of an author, including their linguistic background.
This is particularly useful in situations where a text, e.g. an anonymous letter, is the key piece of evidence in an investigation and clues about the native language of a writer can help investigators in identifying the source.
This has already attracted interest and funding from intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Ria Perkins. 2014. "Linguistic identifiers of L1 Persian speakers writing in English: NLID for authorship analysis". Ph.D. thesis, Aston University.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methodology ==

[[Natural language processing]] methods are used to extract and identify language usage patterns common to speakers of an L1-group. This is done using language learner data, usually from a [[learner corpus]]. Next, [[machine learning]] is applied to train classifiers, like [[support vector machine]]s, for predicting the L1 of unseen texts.&lt;ref&gt;Tetreault et al, [http://anthology.aclweb.org/C/C12/C12-1158.pdf "Native Tongues, Lost and Found: Resources and Empirical Evaluations in Native Language Identification"], In Proc. International Conf. on Computational Linguistics (COLING), 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
A range of ensemble based systems have also been applied to the task and shown to improve performance over single classifier systems.&lt;ref&gt;Malmasi, Shervin, Sze-Meng Jojo Wong, and Mark Dras. [http://anthology.aclweb.org/W/W13/W13-1716.pdf "NLI Shared Task 2013: MQ submission"]. Proceedings of the Eighth Workshop on Innovative Use of NLP for Building Educational Applications. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various linguistic feature types have been applied for this task. These include syntactic features such as constituent parses, grammatical dependencies and part-of-speech tags.
Surface level lexical features such as character, word and lemma [[n-gram|n-grams]] have also been found to be quite useful for this task. However, it seems that character n-grams&lt;ref&gt;Radu Tudor Ionescu, Marius Popescu and Aoife Cahill. [http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/COLI_a_00256 "String Kernels for Native Language Identification: Insights from Behind the Curtains"], Computational Linguistics, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Radu Tudor Ionescu and Marius Popescu. [https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08349 "Can string kernels pass the test of time in Native Language Identification?"], In Proceedings of BEA12, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; are the single best feature for the task.

== 2013 shared task ==
The Building Educational Applications (BEA) workshop at [[NAACL]] 2013 hosted the inaugural NLI shared task.&lt;ref&gt;Tetreault et al, [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.365.5931&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf "A report on the first native language identification shared task"], 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The competition resulted in 29 entries from teams across the globe, 24 of which also published a paper describing their systems and approaches.

== Time at Murdoch University ==
* Dingle was awarded a 'Teaching Excellence Award' by [[Murdoch University]]'s VC in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=VCs Learning and Teaching Awards |url=http://our.murdoch.edu.au/Educational-Development/VCs-Learning-and-Teaching-Awards/List-of-recipients/ |accessdate=27 April 2016 |work=[[Murdoch University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During his time at Murdoch he wrote books about; treating ailments without drugs, nutrition and illness, self-help/memory guidance, medical deceptions and myths, toxic exposure in homes, environmental management and education, bacterial contamination and danger in cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Search/Home?lookfor=author:%22Dingle,%20Peter%22&amp;iknowwhatimean=1 |title=NLA Search Results for author: Dingle, Peter |website=[[National Library of Australia]] |access-date=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Position on autism ==
Dingle says autism is linked to the "(mal)nutrition of our children",&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; and has made the claim that it is "apparent that many cases of autism and ADHD can actually be fixed by dietary changes".&lt;ref name=IT2009&gt;{{cite news |title=More nutrients in premium pet food than children's breakfast cereals |author=. |url=http://www.murdoch.edu.au/Alumni/_document/Intouch-Magazines/Intouch_Autumn_2009.pdf |accessdate=27 April 2016 |date=Autumn 2009 |work=Intouch alumni magazine |publisher=[[Murdoch University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no scientific basis for this view.

== Controversy ==

=== Penelope Dingle's death ===
Dingle's first wife, Penelope, died in August 2005 from cancer following a failed attempt in 2003 to treat her using [[homeopathy]] and spirituality. Due to the delay in seeking competent medical care, the cancer spread and Penelope's weight dropped to 35 kilograms (77 lb). She eventually had a complete [[bowel obstruction]] forcing her to undergo an emergency operation of a [[Palliative care|palliative]] nature in October 2003, before she died in 2005.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The State Coroner noted that Peter Dingle had not done enough to convince his wife to seek timely medical treatment, and that his inaction had contributed to her death. The Coroner also found that the symptoms had been present from at least as early as October 2001, while Penelope was under the care of a homeopath (whom he described as "not a competent health professional") before finally consulting a doctor in December 2002. In early 2003, her cancer was diagnosed and she was presented with a treatment option which the Coroner found would have given her a "good chance of surviving".&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The Coroner also found that her decision to not undergo timely treatment by a competent health professional was "influenced by misinformation and bad science"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.homeowatch.org/news/dingle_finding.pdf |title=Inquest into the death of Penelope DINGLE, No:17/10 |author=AN Hope, W.A.

'''Post literacy''' or '''post literacy education''' is a concept used in [[continuing education]] and [[adult education]] programs aimed at recently [[illiterate]] or "neo-literate" adults and communities, largely in the [[developing world]]. Unlike continuing education or [[further education]], which covers secondary or vocational topics for adult learners, Post literacy programs provide skills which might otherwise be provided in [[primary education]] settings.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Alan. [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/contentdelivery/servlet/ERICServlet?accno=ED472436 Re-Thinking Adult Literacy and Post-Literacy: From an International Perspective]. The Roby Kidd Memorial Lecture.  Uppingham Press (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;  Post literacy education aims to solidify literacy education, provide resources and media aimed at the newly literate, and also may create systems of non-formal education to serve these communities. Projects include providing formal continuing education, providing  written materials (the [[literate environment]]) relevant to economic development to newly literate members of developing societies, and leveraging radio and other non-written media to increase access to educational material in informal settings.&lt;ref&gt;World Bank.

A '''scientific demonstration''' is a [[scientific experiment]] carried out for the purposes of demonstrating scientific principles, rather than for [[hypothesis testing]] or knowledge gathering (although they may originally have been carried out for these purposes).

Most scientific demonstrations are simple laboratory demonstrations intended to demonstrate physical principles, often in a surprising or entertaining way. They are carried out in schools and universities, and sometimes in public demonstrations in popular science lectures and TV programs aimed at the general public. Many scientific demonstrations are chosen for their combination of educational merit and entertainment value, which is often provided by dramatic phenomena such as explosions. 

Public scientific demonstrations were a common occurrence in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], and have long  been a feature of the British [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]], which date back to 1825. In the television era, scientific demonstrations have featured in science-related entertainment shows such as ''[[MythBusters]]'' and ''[[Brainiac: Science Abuse]]''.

==Examples==
Some famous scientific demonstrations include:

* [[Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī|Al-Biruni]]'s [[reaction time]]
* [[Ibn al-Haytham|Alhazen]]'s [[camera obscura]], [[Oil lamp|lamp]] experiment and [[magnifying lens]]
* [[Al-Jazari]]'s [[crankshaft]], [[elephant clock]] and programmable [[robot]]s
* [[Ibn Zuhr|Avenzoar]]'s [[parasite]]s
* [[Detonation|Detonating]] a cloud of [[flour]]
* [[Foucault pendulum|Foucault's pendulum]]
* [[Galileo Galilei]]'s ball experiments, [[pendulum]] and [[telescope]]
* [[Heron's fountain]] and [[aeolipile]]
* [[Ibn al-Nafis]]' [[pulmonary circulation]] and [[coronary circulation]]
* [[Gyroscope|Gyroscopic]] [[bicycle wheel]]
* [[Nylon rope trick]] 
* [[Prince Rupert's Drop]]s
* Shooting a [[candle]] through a [[Plank (wood)|plank]]
* [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]]'s [[alarm clock]], [[steam turbine]]
* Using a [[linear motor]] as a gun
* Using compressed air to drive a [[water rocket]]
* Using [[liquid nitrogen]] to shatter a rose
* [[William Harvey]]'s [[circulatory system]]

Note: many scientific demonstrations are potentially dangerous, and should not be attempted without considerable laboratory experience and appropriate safety precautions. Many older well-known scientific demonstrations, once mainstays of science education, are now effectively impossible to demonstrate to an audience without breaking health and safety laws. Some older demonstrations, such as allowing the audience to play with liquid mercury, are sufficiently dangerous that they should not be attempted by anyone under any circumstances.

[[File:Dr. Seyed Mostafa Azmayesh.JPG|thumb|Seyed Mostafa Azmayesh]]

'''Seyed Mostafa Azmayesh''' is a French-Iranian jurist scholar and researcher, with over 40 years of experience as a Quran expert, and is known for his research in the field of Gnosticism, Islam and Christianity. As a human rights activist, his most notable efforts have been towards the push for reform within fundamentalist regimes, such as Iran, and the reform of social or legal practices that are in violation of [[Human Rights]] principles and freedom of the people. As an academic, he teaches the spiritual path of substantial evolution of an individual based on love, altruism, and spiritual chivalry.

== Biography ==
Seyed Mostafa Azmayesh was born in [[Tehran]] (Iran) in 1952. On completion of his studies in Arabian Literature (Tehran 1974) and Law (Tehran 1975), he moved to France in 1976. In Paris he studied Theology and History of Law at the [[Sorbonne University]], as well as Comparative Studies of Islam and Christianity at the [[University of Lyon]] for which he received two doctorate degrees. One of his professors was the philosopher and theologian [[Henri Corbin]]. After having completed his academic studies he continued his research in the areas of religion, philosophy and various fields of science. Azmayesh was admitted into the lineage of initiates of the Nematollahi-Gonabadi order in 1969, which is the most popular and oldest Sufi order in Iran. Azmayesh is the official representative of the [[Shah Ni'matullah Wali]] [[Gonabadi]] Order outside of Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kayhanlife.com/people/the-gonabadi-dervishes-gnostics-royal-advisors-political-and-religious-adversaries//|title=The Gonabadi Dervishes: Gnostics, Royal Advisors, Political and Religious Adversaries|publisher=Kayhan/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Jurist-scholar and author ==
Azmayesh has over 40 years of experience in the research and study of the Quran. His scholarly work and publications embody an innovative and scientific approach to the Quranic text. His book ''New Researches on the Quran – Why and how two versions of Islam entered the history of mankind'', brings forth many such scientific elements to the text, along with historical findings and contextual elements to the Quran. Some of his other works include – ''The Teachings of a Sufi Master'', ''The Pearl of Sufism'', ''Heart Meditation: An Introduction to Gnostic Heart Meditation'', and ''Crucifixion: Fact or Fiction?''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://seyedazmayesh.com/books/|title=Seyed M. Azmayesh Books|publisher=seyedazmayesh.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teacher of Substantial Evolution ==
Azmayesh founded a spiritual school&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heartmeditation.eu/|title=Heart Meditation: An Introduction to the Gnostic heart|publisher=heartmeditation.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; that teaches the Substantial Evolution Path based on the development of the inner aptitudes of each individual, in order to lead the student towards substantial spiritual evolution based on principles of tolerance, love, humility and respect for each human being regardless of their background, religion, skin color, etc. Azmayesh participates in scientific dialogues and conferences with other researchers and academics, such as Peter Antes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfBTW_aDYHA/|title=Video "A Discussion on Human Rights, Heart Meditation and Altruism"|publisher=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://preservehumanrights.org/2016/10/the-quran-islam-corresponds-with-human-rights/|title=Report "The Compatibility of Human Rights Principles and Religious Values"|publisher=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rupert Sheldrake]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.interculturalcentre.org/consciousness-and-the-extended-mind-with-dr-rupert-sheldrake-and-dr-seyed-azmayesh/|title=Consciousness and the extended mind with Dr. Rupert Sheldrake and Dr Seyed Azmayesh|publisher=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pim van Lommel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.interculturalcentre.org/a-dialogue-on-consciousness-and-spirituality-with-dr-pim-van-lommel-and-dr-seyed-azmayesh/|title=A Dialogue on Consciousness and Spirituality with Dr. Pim van Lommel and Dr. Azmayesh|publisher=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://herzmeditation.eu/termin/herz-dialoge-gespraeche-zu-bewusstsein-spiritualitaet.html|title=Herz-Dialoge - Gespräche zu Bewusstsein &amp; Spiritualität (German language)|publisher=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jay Lakhani]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgf9-noWt60|title=Video "Understanding Consciousness with Jay Lakhani"|publisher=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PS-k5rUqCAQ|title=Video "Science and Spirituality-Creation &amp; Human History According to Sacred Scriptures"|publisher=2 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Markus Peters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.interculturalcentre.org/wisdom-from-the-heart-with-dr-peters-and-dr-azmayesh-2/|title=Wisdom from the heart with Dr Peters and Dr Azmayesh|publisher=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducts lectures and holds workshops throughout Europe. Azmayesh was listed in the Watkins' Mind Body Spirit magazine as one of the [[Watkins Books#Watkins' Spiritual 100 list for 2012|100 Most Spiritually Influential Living People]].

Since the onset of the Iranian Revolution in 1979 and the growth of extremist ideologies under the name of Islam, Azmayesh has worked to oppose those who propagate extremist ideas based on the false interpretation of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dissident-warnings-from-iran_b_1629181.html|title=Article "Dissident warnings from Iran"|publisher=Huffington Post, 28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His activities have included talks in the [[United Nations]] (UN)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQkr_ozFI0w|title=Video "A Call to Iranians to Unite – United Nations Human Rights Council"|publisher=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an exclusive interview with [[Ahmed Shaheed]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEXeUvzoVPw|title=Video "Exclusive Interview with Ahmad Shaheed on Human Right Conditions in Iran in Dorr TV"|publisher=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the former United Nations Special Rapporteur for Human Rights in Iran, along with meetings and interviews with members of the [[European Parliament]], who are responsible for covering the Human Rights issues in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwwEXUFE2XA|title=Video "Freedom of Thought, Belief and Expression - Religious and Ethnic Diversity in Iran" (Persian language)|publisher=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/meetdocs/2009_2014/documents/d-ir/dv/885/885407/885407fr.pdf|title=Report "Speech at the European Parliament"|publisher=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through scholarly research he has shown that Human Rights principles are compatible with Quranic principles, and according to the Quran, a Muslim civilisation must be based on mutual respect and equality for all, regardless of race, gender or religious beliefs, and there is no place for any kind of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.qantara.de/content/interview-with-seyed-mostafa-azmayesh-i-oppose-the-false-muslims|title=Article "I oppose the false Muslims"|publisher=7 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His weekly Radio and online TV programmes, such as Dorr TV,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dorrtv.org/eng/|title=Dorr TV (Persian language)}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the satellite channel PARS-TV,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parstv.tv/programs/|title=PARS TV (Persian language)}}&lt;/ref&gt; put pressure on extremist elements within the Iranian Regime in order to reform the regimes’ radical movements.

For many years, Azmayesh has spoken in opposition of the practice of stoning in Iran. Through research-findings, he proved that there is no relation between Islam and stoning, and his research highlighted how several tyrants throughout history have used stoning punishments for reasons of power and suppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gatestoneinstitute.org/1452/iran-students-sufis-stonings|title=Article "Iran: Students and Sufis Against Stonings"|publisher=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, the practice of stoning is no longer practised in Iran as a result of the years of advocacy by Azmayesh.

In response to the uprising in 2009 following the presidential elections, he supported the Freedom of expression and free speech, and campaigned for the freedom of prominent political prisoners such as [[Nasrin Sotoudeh]] (an Iranian female human rights lawyer),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hriran.com/en/component/content/article/81-articles/6187-profile-nasrin-sotoudeh.html|title=Article "A Profile on Nasrin Sotoudeh"|publisher=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Narges Mohammadi]], and religious and ethnic minorities such as Kurds, Baha’i and Sufis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/10/mar/1099.html|title=Article "Open Letter to the department of justice in Iran on the situation of Dervishes"|publisher=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2011/09/mostafa-azmayesh/|title=Article "Interview with Dervishes’ Spokesperson: Clashes and Widespread Arrests of Gonabadi Dervishes"|publisher=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mehriran.de/en/article/dr-seyed-mostafa-azmayesh-sufis-believe-in-the-absolute-necessity-of-the-separation-between-religi.html|title=Article "An Interview with Dr. Seyed Mostafa Azmayesh: "Sufis Believe in the Absolute Necessity of the Separation Between Religion and Politics"|publisher=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9Q5ArhQINQ|title=Video " BBC Persian – An Interview with Dr. Seyed Mostafa Azmayesh" (Persian language)|publisher=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He has been influential in the release of numerous Sufis who were imprisoned by the extremist elements in the Iranian Regime as part of its program to suppress minorities.

=== Human Rights efforts within Europe ===

In the face of the rise of Islamist extremism in the West, he has spoken at a series of conferences in England, Germany, [[UK Parliament]] and the European Parliament, and published research-based proposals and reports to tackling these growing issues of violence and extremism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theparliamentmagazine.eu/blog/how-can-we-protect-democracy-islamic-extremism|title=Article "How can we protect democracy from Islamic extremism?"|publisher=The Parliament Magazine, 24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://preservehumanrights.org/2016/03/how-to-protect-society-from-islamic-extremism/|title=Report "Conference at European Parliament: "Extremism, Islam and Democracy – Why and How Two Versions of Islam Entered the History of Mankind?""|publisher=IOPHR, 1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friendsofeurope.org/publication/better-understanding-quran-holds-antidote-islamic-extremism|title=Article "Better Understanding of the Quran Holds Antidote to Islamic Extremism"|publisher=Friends of Europe, 11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://preservehumanrights.org/2016/10/are-human-rights-and-islam-compatible-2/|title=Article "Are Human Rights and Islam Compatible?" – Conference at the European Parliament"|publisher=IOPHR, 18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://preservehumanrights.org/2017/05/day-event-antidotes-to-islamist-radicalisation-european-parliament/|title=Article ""Antidotes to Islamist Extremism" – Conference at the European Parliament"|publisher=IOPHR, 2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Azmayesh co-founded the International Organisation to Preserve Human Rights (IOPHR)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://preservehumanrights.org/|title=International Organisation to Preserve Human Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; in February 2014, in order to continue his efforts to protect human rights for all, counter the rise of Islamist extremism and violence, and continue his advocacy for gender-equality and eliminating gender-based violence.

IOPHR is an active not-for-profit organisation and think tank based in the United Kingdom. It is a research-based organisation, with the aim to preserve human rights for all, and eliminate threats to the safety and security of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://preservehumanrights.org/about-us/|title=International Organisation to Preserve Human Rights - Aims and Objectives}}&lt;/ref&gt; IOPHR conducts conferences in the UK Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://preservehumanrights.org/2016/12/are-human-rights-and-islam-compatible/|title="Are Human Rights and Islam Compatible? – Conference at the UK Parliament"|publisher=IOPHR, 6 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; European Parliament,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://preservehumanrights.org/2017/05/european-parliament-are-womens-rights-in-islam-compatible-with-modern-society/|title="Are Women’s Rights in Islam Compatible with Modern Society? – Conference at the European Parliament"|publisher=IOPHR, 3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and across Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://preservehumanrights.org/2016/04/security-jam-2016/|title=Report "Security Jam 2016: Friends of Europe"|publisher=IOPHR, June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; working closely with other activists, researchers, academics, public bodies such as the [[London Metropolitan Police]], and other public service officials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6292">The '''Southern California Coastal Water Research Project''' (SCCWRP) is a research institute focusing on the coastal ecosystems of [[Southern California]] from [[drainage basin|watersheds]] to the ocean. SCCWRP was created as a [[joint powers authority]] (JPA), which is an agency formed when multiple government agencies have a common mission that can be better achieved by pooling resources and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;US Congress, [[Office of Technology Assessment]] (1987). ''Wastes in Marine Environments.'' Washington, DC: [[US Government Printing Office]]. {{ISBN|0-89116-793-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sharpsteen, Bill (2010). ''Dirty Water: One Man's Fight to Clean Up One of the World's Most Polluted Bays.'' Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA: [[University of California Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-520-25660-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of SCCWRP is to gather the necessary scientific information to allow member agencies to effectively and cost-efficiently steward the Southern California coastal environment.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Reducing Stormwater Discharge Contributions to Water Pollution, [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (2009). ''Urban Stormwater Management in the United States.'' Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. p. 512. {{ISBN|978-0-309-12539-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Committee on a Systems Assessment of Marine Environmental Monitoring, National Research Council (1990). ''Managing Troubled Waters: The Role of Marine Environmental Monitoring.'' Washington, DC: National Academy Press. p. 22. {{ISBN|0-309-04194-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
SCCWRP is located in [[Costa Mesa, California]].  SCCWRP's original location (in 1969) was Westwood, California, with subsequent offices in El Segundo, Long Beach and Westminster before moving to the present location in 2007.

==Research==
SCCWRP’s research foci include collaborative regional environmental monitoring, development of assessment tools to characterize environmental conditions, and modeling and analysis to answer relevant environmental management questions. Significant research topics include regional monitoring of the [[Southern California Bight]], beach [[water quality]], [[hydromodification]], [[wetlands]], [[eutrophication]], [[marine debris]], and [[contaminants]] of emerging concern.&lt;ref&gt;Panel on Southern California Bight of the Committee on a Systems Assessment of Marine Environmental Monitoring (1990). ''Monitoring Southern California's Coastal Waters.'' Washington, DC: [[National Academy Press]]. p. 90-91. {{ISBN|0-309-04327-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Soule, Dorothy F. and [[Don Walsh]] (1983). ''Waste disposal in the oceans: minimizing impact, maximizing benefits.'' Boulder, CO: [[Westview Press]]. {{ISBN|0-86531-966-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also works to transition new technologies to the user community, and foster communication among different stakeholder sectors, including regulatory agencies, [[wastewater]] dischargers, [[stormwater]] managers, academic researchers, [[nonprofit]] groups, technology developers, and industries affected by aquatic and marine resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vcstar.com/news/clean-beach-measuring-to-improve|title=Eye on the Environment: Clean beach measuring to improve|first=Bram |last=Sercu|work=[[Ventura County Star]]|date= July 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
SCCWRP was formed in 1969, at about the time when California’s Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act was passed, to prepare an integrative report about the effects of wastewater and other discharges on the Southern California coastal marine environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Mearns|first1=Alan J |first2=M James |last2=Allen|first3=Michael D |last3=Moore|year=2001|title=The Southern California Coastal Water Research Project - 30 years of environmental research in the Southern California Bight|url=ftp://ftp.sccwrp.org/pub/download/DOCUMENTS/AnnualReports/1999AnnualReport/01_ar01.pdf|format=PDF|pages=2-26 |editor1=S.B. Weisberg|editor2=D. Elmore|series=Southern California Coastal Water Research Project 1999-2000 Annual Report|publisher=Southern California Coastal Water Research Project|accessdate=May 5, 2014|location=Westminster, CA.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though originally intended as a three-year project, SCCWRP was reauthorized to conduct further research in 1972 owing to the many data gaps identified in the summary report.&lt;ref&gt;Wick, Gerald (July 1973). “California’s Outfalls.” ''[[New Scientist]]'' '''59'''(854): 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt; The JPA has since been amended several times, extending SCCWRP’s existence through to the present day.

==Member Agencies==
SCCWRP's original member agencies in 1969 included the five largest southern California metropolitan sanitation agencies ([[City of San Diego]], [[Los Angeles|City of Los Angeles]], [[Los Angeles County]] Sanitation District, [[Orange County Sanitation District]], and [[Ventura County]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kennish, Michael J (1998). ''Pollution Impacts on Marine Biotic Communities.'' Boca Raton, FL: [[CRC Press]]. p. 151-152. {{ISBN|0-8493-8428-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent years, additional member agencies were added to the JPA. 

These include water quality regulatory agencies added in 1990 ([[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], Region IX; [[California State Water Resources Control Board]]; Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board; Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board; and San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board) and the largest southern California stormwater management agencies added in 2003 (Ventura County Watershed Protection District, Los Angeles County Flood Control District, Orange County Public Works, and [[County of San Diego]]). The most recent addition was the California Ocean Protection Council, which was added in 2007 to enhance interactions with the [[California Resources Agency]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2116">'''Systems immunology''' is a recent research field that, under the larger umbrella of [[systems biology]], aims to study the [[immune system]] in the more integrated perspective on how entities and players participate at different system levels to the immune function.

The immune system has been thoroughly analyzed as regards to its components and function by using a very successful "[[reductionist]]" approach, but its overall functioning principles cannot easily be predicted by studying the properties of its isolated components because they strongly rely on and arise from the [[interactions]] among these numerous constituents. Systems immunology represents a different approach for the integrated comprehension of the immune system structure and function based on [[complex systems]] theory, [[high-throughput screening|high-throughput]] techniques, as well as on mathematical and computational tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khan TA, Friedensohn S, de Vries AR, Straszewski J, Ruscheweyh HJ, Reddy ST |title=Accurate and predictive antibody repertoire profiling by molecular amplification fingerprinting |journal=Sci.

The '''Tango Desktop Project''' is an [[Open-source software|open-source]] initiative to create a set of design guidelines and to provide a consistent [[user experience]] for applications on [[desktop environment]]s. The project has created a set of [[computer icon|icon]]s known as the Tango Icon Library, which is described as a "proof of concept".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library |accessdate=2011-06-15 |title=Tango Icon Library – Tango Desktop Project |date=2010-08-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120233412/http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library |archive-date=2016-01-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tango Desktop Project is a project of [[freedesktop.org]], and is closely linked with other freedesktop.org guidelines such as the Standard Icon Theming Specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/icon-theme-spec |title=icon-theme-spec |publisher=Freedesktop.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objectives ==

The objective of the project is to allow software developers to easily integrate their software, in terms of appearance, with the desktop computer. The visual inconsistencies that arise from different [[Freedesktop.org|desktop]] environments ([[KDE]], [[GNOME]], [[Xfce]]...) and custom distributions make it hard for third parties to target [[Linux]]. Ideally, any project that follows the Tango guidelines will have a [[look and feel]] that matches well with other icons and applications that follow the guidelines.

The style does not aim to be visually unique to distinguish itself. Instead, a secondary aim of the project is to create a standard style that makes applications look appropriate running on operating systems common at that time, such that [[Independent software vendor|ISV]]s will find that their application does not look out of place on [[Windows XP]], [[macOS|Mac OS X]], [[KDE]], [[GNOME]], or [[Xfce]].

Apart from the visual guidelines, the project aims to provide a set of common metaphors for the icons. Tango follows the Freedesktop.org's [[Standard Icon Theming Specification]] and actively develops the [[Freedesktop.org]]'s [[Standard Icon Naming Specification]], defining names for the most common icons and the used metaphors.

Many free software projects, such as [[GIMP]], [[Scribus]], and [[GNOME]], have started to follow the Tango style guidelines for their icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=Tango Showroom |date=2008-09-12 |website=Tango Desktop Project |url=http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Showroom |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906111805/http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Showroom |archive-date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[ReactOS]] and [[Mozilla Firefox 3]] uses Tango icons when it is unable to find the user's installed iconset, and also for icons not covered by said iconset.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A first look at the Firefox 3 visual refresh for Linux | url = https://blog.mozilla.org/faaborg/2007/11/13/update-on-the-firefox-3-linux-theme/ | date=2007-11-13 | accessdate=2008-07-11 | first = Alex | last = Faaborg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible for proprietary closed source applications to use Tango Desktop Project icons. Examples highlighted by the Tango Showroom include VMware Workstation 6 and Medsphere OpenVista CIS.

== History ==

The Tango icons were originally released under a [[copyleft]] [[Creative Commons]] [[Creative Commons licenses|license]] (Attribution-ShareAlike), but were released into the [[public domain]] in 2009 in order to make it easier to reuse them.

== Palette ==

==Description==
'''Taqbil''' in Arabic literally means '''Kissing'''.  In [[Hadhramaut]], the Sayyid people receive gestures of respect from the rest of population in recognition of their descent from [[Muhammad]]. These gestures include the method of greeting, in which their hand (usually right hand) is kissed and/or sniffed.  This hand-kissing is performed even when the recipient is still a child or a person without any special distinction in terms of religious knowledge or piety, in recognition of the [[nobility]] of the bloodline rather than the merits of the particular individual.&lt;ref name="edge"/&gt;  This tradition of Taqbil was called ''Shamma'' in Hadhramaut.&lt;ref name="mapilla"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlb5BrabQd8C| title=Mappila Muslims: A Study on Society and Anti Colonial Struggles| first=Husain |last=Raṇṭattāṇi| publisher=Other Books| year=2007| isbn=978-8-190388788| accessdate=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, some members of the [[Sayyid|Sada]] continued to put forth justifications for their special treatment.  One of the prominent jurisprudents at the time, Abdurrahman bin Muhammad al-Mashhoor addressed the matter of the special status of the [[Ba'Alawi sada|Sada]] in Hadhramaut.  He asserted that "the descendants of the Prophet were the most favored of people, and the descendants of [[Ba 'Alawi sada|'Alawi]] the most favored of them all" because of religious learning and practice, their high moral standing, their blessedness and their piety.  In response to a question as to the correctness of the practice of kissing the hands of ''Sada'', he asserted that it was correct according to [[Shafi'i]] authorities.&lt;ref name="edge"/&gt;

The tradition currently is no longer common among [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]], except when a person greets a respected Sayyid out of paying respect to his knowledge-ability or piety  (such as to a [[Habib]] or a [[Shaikh]]) .

==History==

===Inception===
In 2004, [[Leiden University]] professor [[George K. Miley]] first began exploring the idea of setting up an astronomy programme to educate and inspire young children, especially those from underprivileged backgrounds. He had been awarded an Academy Professorship by the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and decided to use part of the associated funding to explore the feasibility of setting up such a programme. With considerable support and encouragement from [[Claus Madsen]] at ESO, a successful workshop was held in Germany and it was agreed that the programme was worth pursuing. Universe Awareness (UNAWE) was born.

Shortly afterwards, Carolina Ödman was appointed as the first UNAWE International Project Manager. In 2006, thanks to a grant provided by the Netherlands Minister of Education Culture and Science, Ms. van der Hoeven, the UNAWE International Office was founded at Leiden Observatory, the Netherlands. With the help of Sarah Levin as Media Coordinator, Ödman built UNAWE into a thriving global project, with a network of about 400 experts from 40 countries.

===Reach===
UNAWE became a Cornerstone project of the successful UN-ratified IAU/UNESCO International Year of Astronomy in 2009 (IYA2009). During IYA2009, thousands of UNAWE activities were organised in more than 45 countries. For example, in Venezuela, 43 teacher training sessions reached more than 1500 teachers and well over 60 000 children.

2010 saw many changes for UNAWE. Firstly, Ödman left her coordinating role with UNAWE to join the [[African Institute for Mathematical Sciences]] Next Einstein Initiative, handing over the reins to the former Global Coordinator for IYA2009, Pedro Russo. Later that year, the European Union awarded a grant of 1.9 million euros to fund a 3-year project called European Universe Awareness (EU-UNAWE), which builds on the work of Universe Awareness (UNAWE). With this grant, EU-UNAWE is now being further developed in six selected countries: the Netherlands, Germany, Spain, Italy, the United Kingdom and South Africa.

EU-UNAWE is endorsed by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) and it is now an integral part of the IAU Strategic Plan 2010–2020, which is called Astronomy for the Developing World. This is an ambitious blueprint that aims to use astronomy to foster education and provide skills and competencies in science and technology throughout the world, particularly in developing countries..

'''Uses and gratifications theory''' (UGT) is  an approach to understanding why and how people actively seek out specific media to satisfy specific needs. UGT is an audience-centered approach to understanding [[mass communication]].&lt;ref name="SeverinTankard"&gt;{{cite book|last=Severin|first=Werner|last2=Tankard|first2=James|year=1997|isbn=0801317037|title=Communication theories: Origins, methods, and uses in the mass media|publisher=[[Longman]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diverging from other media effect theories that question "what does media do to people?", UGT focuses on "what do people do with media?"&lt;ref name=Katz_1959&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katz|first=Elihu|authorlink=Elihu Katz|title=Mass Communications Research and the Study of Popular Culture: An Editorial Note on a Possible Future for this Journal|journal=Departmental Papers (ASC)|year=1959|pages=1–6|url=http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1168&amp;context=asc_papers&amp;sei-redir=1&amp;referer=http%3A%2F%2Fscholar.google.com%2Fscholar_url%3Fhl%3Den%26q%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Frepository.upenn.edu%2Fcgi%2Fviewcontent.cgi%253Farticle%253D1168%2526context%253Dasc_papers%26sa%3DX%26scisig%3DAAGBfm3sEC9JZkct13HTnv8rJNash_GE2Q%26oi%3Dscholarr#search=%22http%3A%2F%2Frepository.upenn.edu%2Fcgi%2Fviewcontent.cgi%3Farticle%3D1168%26context%3Dasc_papers%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It postulates that media is a highly available product and the audiences are the consumers of the same product

This [[communication theory]] is [[positivistic]] in its approach, based in the [[Social psychology|socio-psychological]] communication tradition, and focuses on communication at the [[mass media]] scale.&lt;ref name="West 2007 392–409"&gt;{{cite book|last=West|first=Richard|last2=Turner|first2=Lynn H.|year=2007|title=Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|pages=392–409|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill Higher Education]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driving question of UGT is: ''Why'' do people use media and what do they use them for? UGT discusses how users deliberately choose media that will satisfy given needs and allow one to enhance knowledge, relaxation, social interactions/companionship, diversion, or escape.&lt;ref name=Severin_Tankard&gt;{{cite book|last=Severin|first=Werner J.|title=Communication Theories: Origins, Methods and Uses in the Mass Media|year=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley Longman|isbn=0801333350|last2=Tankard Jr.|first2=James W.|chapter=2: New Media Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McQuail_2010&gt;{{cite book|last=McQuail|first=Denis|authorlink=Denis McQuail|title=Mass communication theory: an introduction|year=2010|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|location=[[London]]|isbn=1849202923|pages=420–430}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"What Can Uses and Gratifications Theory Tell Us About Social Media?" Education|Ithink. 29 July 2010. Web. 17 October 2011. &lt;http://matei.org/ithink/2010/07/29/what-can-uses-and-gratifications-theory-tell-us-about-social-media&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

It assumes that audience members are not passive consumers of media. Rather, the audience has power over their [[media consumption]] and assumes an active role in interpreting and integrating media into their own lives. Unlike other theoretical perspectives, UGT holds that audiences are responsible for choosing media to meet their desires and needs to achieve gratification. This theory would then imply that the media compete against other information sources for viewers' gratification.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;[[Elihu Katz|Katz, Elihu]], [[Jay Blumler|Jay G. Blumler]], and Michael Gurevitch. "Uses and Gratifications Research." ''[[Public Opinion Quarterly]]'' 4th ser. 37 (1973–1974): 509-23. JSTOR. Web. 14 Oct. 2011. &lt;http://jstor.org/stable/2747854&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

UGT has a [[heuristic]] value today because it gives communication scholars a "perspective through which a number of ideas and theories about media choice, consumption, and even impact can be viewed".&lt;ref name=Baran_Davis&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baran|first1=Stanley J.|last2=Davis|first2=Dennis K.|title=Mass communication theory : foundations, ferment, and future|year=2009|publisher=[[Cengage|Wadsworth]]|location=[[Boston]], MA|isbn=0495898872|pages=416|edition=6th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jpokJDPWt_MC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Mass+communication+theory+:+foundations,+ferment,+and+future&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zFJhUqXwLoS69gTnhIGICg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Mass%20communication%20theory%20%3A%20foundations%2C%20ferment%2C%20and%20future&amp;f=false|accessdate=18 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses and gratifications approach==
Mark Levy and [[Sven Windahl]] provide a good description of what it means to be an "active consumer" of media:

:"As commonly understood by gratifications researchers, the term "audience activity" postulates a voluntaristic and selective orientation by audiences toward the communication process. In brief, it suggests that media use is motivated by needs and goals that are defined by audience members themselves, and that active participation in the communication process may facilitate, limit, or otherwise influence the gratifications and effects associated with exposure. Current thinking also suggests that audience activity is best conceptualized as a variable construct, with audiences exhibiting varying ''kinds'' and ''degrees'' of activity."&lt;ref name=Levy_Windahl&gt;{{cite journal|last=Levy|first=Mark|author2=Sven Windahl|title=The concept of audience activity|journal=Media gratifications research: Current perspectives|year=1985|pages=109–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assumptions of the theory===
Unlike other theories concerning media consumption, UGT gives the consumer power to discern what media they consume, with the assumption that the consumer has a clear intent and use. This contradicts previous theories such as '''mass society theory''', that states that people are helpless victims of mass media produced by large companies; and '''individual differences perspective''', which states that intelligence and self-esteem largely drive an individual's media choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gusfield|first1=Joseph R.|title=The reflexivity of social movements: Collective behavior and mass society theory revisited.|date=1994|publisher=[[Temple University Press]]|location=[[Philadelphia]]|isbn=978-1566391870|page=60|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Given these differing theories, UGT is unique in its assumptions:&lt;ref name="West 2007 392–409"/&gt;
*The audience is active and its media use is goal oriented
*The initiative in linking need gratification to a specific medium choice rests with the audience member
*The media compete with other resources for need satisfaction
*People have enough self-awareness of their media use, interests, and motives to be able to provide researchers with an accurate picture of that use.
*Value judgments of media content can only be assessed by the audience.

===Heuristic approach of UGT===
Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch synthesized that UGT's approach was focused on "the social and psychological origins of needs, which generate expectations of the mass media or other sources, which lead to differential patterns of media exposure (or engagement in other activities), resulting in need gratifications and some other consequences, perhaps mostly unintended ones."&lt;ref name=Severin_Tankard /&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

According to Katz, Blumler and Gurevitch's research there were five components comprising the Uses and Gratifications Approach. The components are:&lt;ref&gt;[[Elihu Katz|Katz, Elihu]], [[Jay Blumler|Jay G. Blumler]], and Michael Gurevitch. "Uses and Gratifications Research."The Public Opinion Quarterly 4th ser. 37 38(1973–1974): 509-23. JSTOR. Web. 14 Oct. 2011.&lt;http://jstor.org/stable/2747854&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The audience is conceived as active.
#In the mass communication process, much initiative in linking gratification and media choice lies with the audience member. 
#The media compete with other sources of satisfaction.
#Methodologically speaking, many of the goals of mass media use can be derived from data supplied by individual audience members themselves. 
#Value judgments about the cultural significance of mass communication should be suspended while audience orientations are explored on their own terms.

According to the research, goals for media use can be grouped into five uses.&lt;ref name=McQuail_2010 /&gt; The audience wants to:
#be informed or educated
#identify with characters of the situation in the media environment
#simple entertainment
#enhance social interaction
#escape from the stresses of daily life

===Gratifications sought (GS) vs. gratifications obtained (GO)===
GS and GO is one of the research issues dealing with U&amp;G theory, and it is a contrast between "what you were seeking from experience" versus "what you actually got from the experience - whether it was a satisfying experience or not."

==History==
Beginning in the 1940s, researchers began seeing patterns under the perspective of the uses and gratifications theory in radio listeners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lazarsfeld|first1=Paul F.|authorlink=Paul Lazarsfeld|title=Radio and the printed page; an introduction to the study of radio and its role in the communication of ideas.|date=1940|publisher=[[Duell, Sloan, and Pearce]]|location=New York, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early research was concerned with topics such as children's use of comics and the absence of newspapers during a newspaper strike. An interest in more psychological interpretations emerged during this time period. 

In 1948, Lasswell introduced a four-functional interpretation of the media on a macro-sociological level. Media served the functions of surveillance, correlation, entertainment and cultural transmission for both society and individuals&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

===Stages of the theory===
Uses and gratifications theory was developed from a number of prior communication theories and research conducted by fellow theorists.

====Stage 1====
*In 1944, researchers began to look into the earliest forms of uses and gratifications with their work classifying the reasons for why people chose specific types of media. Whilst researchers were studying, Herzog interviewed various soap opera fans and was able to identify three types of gratifications. The three gratifications categories, based on why people listened to soap operas, were emotional, wishful thinking, and learning.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*According to West and Turner, UGT was an extension of [[Needs and Motivation Theory]], as outlined by [[Abraham Maslow]] in 1954, which argues that people actively looked to satisfy their needs based on a hierarchy. These needs are organized as [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]] in the form of a pyramid with the largest, most fundamental needs at the base and the need for self-actualization at the top. From the bottom-up the pyramid contains Biological/Physical, Security/Safety, Social/Belonging, Ego/Self-Respect and Self-actualization at the top.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*In 1954 [[Wilbur Schramm]] developed the fraction of selection, a formula for determining which form of mass media an individual would select. The formula helped to decide the amount of gratification an individual would expect to gain from the medium over how much effort they had to make to achieve gratification.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"&gt;West, Richard L., and Lynn H. Turner. "Uses and Gratifications Theory." Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2010. 392-409. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stage 2====
*In 1969 [[Jay Blumler]] and [[Denis McQuail]] studied the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 election]] in the United Kingdom by examining people's motives for watching certain political programs on television. By categorizing the audience's motives for viewing a certain program, they aimed to classify viewers according to their needs in order to understand any potential mass-media effects.&lt;ref name=Severin_Tankard /&gt; The audience motivations they were able to identify helped lay the groundwork for their research in 1972 and eventually uses and gratifications theory.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*In 1972 Denis McQuail, Jay Blumler and Joseph Brown suggested that the uses of different types of media could be grouped into 4 categories. The four categories were: diversion, personal relationships, personal identity and surveillance.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*In 1973-74 McQuail, Blumler and Brown were joined by [[Elihu Katz]], [[Michael Gurevitch]] and [[Hadassah Haas]], in their media exploration. The collaborative research began to indicate how people saw the mass media.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;

====Stage 3====
*The most recent interest surrounding Uses and Gratifications Theory is the link between the reason why media is used and the achieved gratification.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*UGT researchers are developing the theory to be more predictive and explanatory by connecting the needs, goals, benefits, and consequences of media consumption and use along with individual factors.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*Work in UGT was trailblazing because the research of Katz, Blumler, and Gurevitch built on Herzog's research and caused a paradigm shift from how media influences people to how audiences use media, diminishing the dominance of the limited effects approach to mass media studies.&lt;ref name="WestTurner392409"/&gt;
*In the 1980s, Rehman (1983) applied UGT to study the relationship between the movie audience expectations and satisfaction derived from going to the movies.

==Modern applications of uses and gratifications research==
===Mobile phone usage===
[[Mobile phones]], a comparatively new technology, have many uses and gratifications attached to them. Due to their nature of mobility, constant access, and options to both add and access content, this field is expanding with new research on the motivations behind using mobile phones.

In general, people use mobile phones for the following uses and gratifications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leung|first=L.|author2=Wei, R.|title=More than just talk on the move: A use-and-gratification study of the cellular phone|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|year=2000|volume=77|issue=2|pages=308–320|doi=10.1177/107769900007700206}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Affection/sociability
*Entertainment
*Instrumentality
*Psychological reassurance
*Fashion/status
*Mobility
*Immediate access

Uses and gratifications do, however, differ based on location and audience:
*Using mobile phones on buses, cars, and trains is related to the UG of mobility and immediate access
*Talking to business partners is related to the UG of instrumentality
*Talking to family members is related to the UG of mobility and affection

The specific function of text messaging has been studied&lt;ref name="Grellhesl 2012 2175–2181"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grellhesl|first=Melanie|author2=Narissra M. Punyanunt-Carter|title=Using the Uses and Gratifications Theory to Understand Gratifications Sought through Text Messaging Practices of Male and Female Undergraduate Students|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2012|volume=28|issue=6|pages=2175–2181|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.06.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; to find its uses and gratifications and explore any potential gender differences. The researchers proposed seven uses and gratifications; they are listed below, from highest to lowest ranked according to the study's results:
*Accessibility/mobility
*Relaxation
*Escape
*Entertainment
*Information seeking
*Coordination for business
*Socialization/affection seeking
*Status seeking

The results also displayed gender differences (in an undergraduate population): women scored the UG of accessibility/mobility, relaxation and escape, and coordination higher than the men did. These results may imply social and societal expectations for females around independence but connected to family and friends and/or a tendency for women to rely more on detailed conversation in text messaging than men.&lt;ref name="Grellhesl 2012 2175–2181"/&gt;

Since many now use their mobile phones as devices to connect to the internet and both contribute and retrieve content, researchers have investigated the UG of smart devices which engage multiple media. The uses and gratifications for contributing mobile content differ from those for retrieving mobile content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chua|first=Alton Y.K.|author2=Dion Hoe-Lian Goh|author3=Chei Sian Lee|title=Mobile Content Contribution and Retrieval: An Exploratory Study Using the Uses and Gratifications Paradigm|journal=Information Processing &amp; Management|year=2012|volume=48|issue=1|pages=13–22|doi=10.1016/j.ipm.2011.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Contribution''': Leisure, entertainment, easy access, and passing time are all motivations for adding material.
*'''Retrieval''': Efficient access of information resources/services and the need for high quality information are uses and gratifications for accessing content.

===Internet usage===
The [[Internet]] provides a new and deep field for exploring UGT. It was found to have three main categories of gratifications: content gratification, process gratification, and social gratification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stafford|first=Thomas F.|author2=Marla Royne Stafford|author3=Lawrence L. Schkade|title=Determining Uses and Gratifications for the Internet|journal=Decision Sciences|date=Spring 2004|volume=35|issue=2|pages=259–288|doi=10.1111/j.00117315.2004.02524.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Content''': Uses for the Internet include the need for researching or finding specific information or material, which are gratified with content.
*'''Process''': Users gain gratification from the experience of purposeful navigating or random browsing of the Internet in its functional process.
*'''Social''': Uses encompass a wide range of forming and deepening social ties.

Scholars like LaRose et al. utilize UGT to understand Internet usage via a socio-cognitive framework to reduce uncertainties that arise from homogenizing an Internet audience and explaining media usage in terms of only positive outcomes (gratifications). LaRose et al. created measures for self-efficacy and self-disparagement and related UGT to negative outcomes of online behavior (like Internet addiction) as well.&lt;ref name=LaRose_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=LaRose|first=Robert|author2=Dana Mastro|author3=Matthew S. Eastin|title=Understanding Internet Usage: A Social-Cognitive Approach to Uses and Gratifications|journal=Social Science Computer Review|year=2001|volume=19|issue=395|url=http://www.ensani.ir/storage/Files/20110209150302-%D9%81%D9%87%D9%85%20%DA%A9%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A8%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C%20%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%AA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social media usage===
Recent research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leung|first=Louis|title=Generational Differences in Content Generation in Social Media: The Roles of the Gratifications Sought and of Narcissism|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2013|volume=29|issue=3|pages=997–1006|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.12.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; has looked at [[social networking services]], personal and subject-based [[blogs]], and [[internet forums]] put together to study the U&amp;G in posting social content, the relationship between gratifications and narcissism, and the effects of age on this relationship and these gratifications. Users have motivations of the following overall:
*'''Social and affection'''
*'''Need to vent negative feelings'''
*'''Recognition'''
*'''Entertainment'''
*'''Cognitive needs'''

Forums were found to be the main media for venting negative feelings, potentially due to the fact that comparatively, forums are more of a one-way street. Use of social media cures loneliness and satisfies a compulsion for addictive behaviors. Similar to the variables of gender, location, and audience as previous research has found, the U&amp;G differed by category of narcissism. The researchers found four multi-dimensional narcissistic personality types: feeling authoritative or superior, exhibitionistic, exploitative, and often hungry for vanity. The U&amp;G differed depending on the specific type of narcissism a given user had. For instance, those who were exhibitionistic tended to focus on the social media U&amp;G of showing affection, expressing negative feelings, and being recognized. Those who viewed themselves as superior had higher uses and gratifications by cognitive motivations than by recognition. The vain narcissists were most gratified by recognition and attention, and they did not vent negative feelings. Exhibitionists were motivated by all gratifications of social media. No generational differences were found in the narcissistic tendencies.

====Friend-networking sites====
Basic research finds that socialization motivates use of friend-networking sites such as MySpace and Facebook. Particulars under socialization might be finding old friends, making new friends, learning about events, creating social functions, and feeling connected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Raacke|first=John|author2=Jennifer Bonds-Raacke|title=MySpace and Facebook: Applying the Uses and Gratifications Theory to Exploring Friend-Networking Sites|journal=CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior|year=2008|volume=11|issue=2|pages=169–174|doi=10.1089/cpb.2007.0056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some further exploration has demonstrated that although emotional, cognitive, social, and habitual uses are motivational to use social media, not all uses are consistently gratified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Zheng|author2=John M. Tchernev|author3=Tyler Solloway|title=A Dynamic Longitudinal Examination of Social Media Use, Needs, and Gratifications Among College Students|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2012|volume=28|issue=5|pages=1829–1839|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.05.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In research examining [[Facebook]] groups' users' gratifications in relation to their civic participation offline, 1,715 college students were asked "to rate their level of agreement with specific reasons for using [[Facebook]] groups, including information acquisition about campus/community, entertainment/recreation, social interaction with friends and family, and peer pressure/self satisfaction."&lt;ref&gt;Park, Namsu, Kerk F. Kee, and Sebastian Valenzuela. "Being Immersed in Social Networking Environment: Facebook Groups, Uses and Gratifications, and Social Outcomes. "CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior 12.6 (2009) 729-33. Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; The study ultimately yielded results through principal components factor analysis with varimax rotation. The results showed that there were four needs for using Facebook groups, "socializing, entertainment, self-status seeking, and information."
*'''Socializing''': Students were interested in talking and meeting with others to achieve a sense of community and peer support on the particular topic of the group.
*'''Entertainment''': Students engaged with the groups to amuse themselves.
*'''Self-Seeking''': Students sought out or maintained their personal status, as well as those of their friends, through the online group participation.
*'''Information''': Students used the group to receive information about related events going on and off campus.

====Twitter====
[[Twitter]] is an online micro-blogging platform that contains both mass-media functions and interpersonal communication options via sending tweets. Research has found a positive correlation between active time spent on Twitter and the gratification of a need for "an informal sense of camaraderie"—connection—with other users. Furthermore, the frequency of tweets and number of replies and public messages mediated the relationship between Twitter users. This helped increase both use and gratification of the media by satisfying the need for connection.&lt;ref name=Chen_2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Gina Masullo|title=Tweet this: A uses and gratifications perspective on how active Twitter use gratifies a need to connect with others|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=March 2011|volume=27|issue=2|pages=755–762|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2010.10.023|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.10.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Snapchat====
Snapchat is a photo-sharing social media platform with more than 178 million users worldwide. Similar to other forms of social media, people use Snapchat to fulfill specific media needs. Compared to social media sites such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, Snapchat is used more to fulfill private media needs. For example, Phua, Jin, and Kim found that Snapchat interactions were similar to interactions found in close interpersonal relationships. The application has been used to attain emotional support from others, look for advice on important decisions, and seek help to solve problems, satisfying the need to socialize, vent negative feelings, and connect with others.&lt;ref name=Phua_2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phua|first1=Joe|last2=Jin|first2=Seunga Venus|last3=Kim|first3=Jihoon|title=Uses and Gratifications of social networking cites for bridging and bonding social capital: A comparison of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=72|issue=July 2017|pages=115–122|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2017.02.041|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other applications====
Many other aspects of UGT are featured in using various websites that are related to social networking. Many review services, such as [[Yelp.com]], have an aspect of social networking, with user profiles and interconnectivity. Many news websites feature the ability to share articles and pictures directly from their page to users' personal social networking pages across platforms. Understandably, information seeking is an overwhelming U&amp;G for these applications, especially the review sites like Yelp.com. Other U&amp;G included entertainment, convenience, interpersonal utility, and passing time. A more sinister aspect of UGT and a reason to use social media establishes a platform for cyberbullying.

People engage in cyberbullying online and through social media in order to gratify themselves. Cyberbullying fulfills a need to be vengeful and malicious, while avoiding face-to-face contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hicks|first=Amy|author2=Stephen Comp|author3=Jeannie Horovitz|author4=Madeline Hovarter|author5=Maya Miki|author6=Jennifer L. Bevan|title=Why People Use Yelp.com: An Exploration of Uses and Gratifications|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2012|volume=28|issue=6|pages=2274–2279|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.06.034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, besides information seeking, users who share news are motivated by U&amp;G of socializing and status seeking, especially if they have had prior experience with social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Chei Sian|author2=Long Ma|title=News Sharing in Social Media: The Effect of Gratifications and Prior Experience|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2012|volume=28|issue=2|pages=331–339|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2011.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instant messaging===
As with text messaging, similar U&amp;G were studied&lt;ref name="Leung 2001 482–500"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leung|first=L.|title=College student motives for chatting on ICQ|journal=New Media &amp; Society|year=2001|volume=3|issue=4|pages=482–500|doi=10.1177/14614440122226209}}&lt;/ref&gt; with instant messaging, or participating in an "[[online chat]]," and these results were also mitigated by gender:
*'''Relaxation'''
*'''Entertainment'''
*'''Fashion'''
*'''Inclusion'''
*'''Affection'''
*'''Sociability'''
*'''Escape'''

Again, differences were found based on amount of use and gender. Those who used the instant messaging service frequently ("heavy users") were found to be most motivated by affection and sociability; those who did not ("light users") were most motivated by fashion. Women chatted longer and for sociability; men chatted for less time per session and for entertainment and relaxation.&lt;ref name="Leung 2001 482–500"/&gt;

===Online gaming===
This new branch of research explores the U&amp;G of starting to play games online. Achievement, enjoyment and social interaction are all motivations for starting to play an online game, and their success at the game as well as the extent to which their uses were gratified predicted their continuance in playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wu|first=Jen-Her|author2=Shu-Ching Wang|author3=Ho-Huang Tsai|title=Falling in Love with Online Games: The Uses and Gratifications Perspective|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|year=2010|volume=26|issue=6|pages=1862–1871|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.07.033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mobile Gaming and Augmented Reality===
In 2017, researchers applied Uses and Gratification Theory to study user behavior among [[Pokémon Go]] users. Results show that enjoyment, physical activity, nostalgia, image, normative influences and flow drive various forms of user behavior. In addition, perceived physical risks (but not perceived privacy risks) lead to weaker forms of usage. Findings of this study show that Uses and Gratification theory provides a promising framework to study Augmented Reality, and that U&amp;GT provides a robust framework that can be supplemented with other theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rauschnabel|first=Philipp A.|last2=Rossmann|first2=Alexander|last3=Dieck|first3=M.

===Animated news===
In 2011, a test was conducted with 312 college students to investigate their viewing of animated news. The use of melodramatic animation in news was seen as an emerging technique used in news reporting at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://enx.sagepub.com/content/6/3/131.short|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130105001915/http://enx.sagepub.com/content/6/3/131.short|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-01-05|title=Can News Be Imaginative?

Factor analysis and hierarchical regression were employed for data analysis.

In the study, seven motives were identified, through factor analysis, for viewing such animated news videos. These motives included companionship, social interaction, relaxation, information seeking, interpersonal learning, entertainment and pass time.
*'''Social interaction motive''': getting information for facilitating discussion with others
*'''Relaxation motive''': watching animated news to release pressure and unwind
*'''Information-seeking motive''': viewing animated news to stay abreast of current events or to search for information
*'''Entertainment motive''': viewing animated news for amusement and enjoyment
*'''Pass time motive''': viewing animated news to occupy time or when individuals have nothing better to do
*'''Interpersonal learning motive''': the desire to understand the minds of friends or significant others by watching the animated news videos that are shared by these individuals
*'''Companionship motive''': to alleviate loneliness

The results of hierarchical regression analysis suggest predictive relationships among personality characteristics (sensation seeking and locus of control), the seven motives, the effects of perceived news credibility and newsworthiness, and the intention to share such animated news videos with others.

===Entertainment media===
Research has shown that media taken in for entertainment purposes (i.e., movies, songs, television, etc.) have a wide range of uses and emotional gratifications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartsch|first=Anne|author2=Reinhold Viehoff|title=The Use of Media Entertainment and Emotional Gratification|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|date=March 29, 2010|volume=5|pages=2247–2255|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.07.444}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that these are not mutually exclusive but can overlap with each other. Rehman (1983) demonstrated a relationship between gratifications sought and obtained from the movies and movie attendance.
*'''Mood management''': This is the most prominently cited emotional gratification of media use. People prefer to maintain a state of intermediate arousal; this is a pleasant medium. When in a bad mood, bored, or over-aroused, people will seek media as regulation for or distraction from their mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zillman|first=D|title=Mood management through communication choices|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|year=1988|volume=31|pages=327–340|doi=10.1177/000276488031003005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zillman|first=D|title=Mood Management in the context of selective exposure theory.|journal=Communication Yearbook|year=2000|volume=23|pages=103–123|editor1-first=M. F.|editor1-last=Roloff}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Affective disposition''': Affective disposition theory states that people enjoy "rooting for" characters depicted as good and moral. Users experience gratification when good things happen to characters with "good" morals and also when bad things happen to "evil" or "bad" characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Communication and emotion: Essays in honor of Dolf Zillmann|year=2003|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=61–84|author=Raney, A. A.|authorlink=Disposition-based theories of enjoyment|editor1=J. Bryant|editor2=D. Roskos-Ewoldsen|editor3=J. Cantor }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Excitation transfer''': This use and gratification for media posits that people like to feel worried for characters we perceive as "good," and this is even more gratifying if that character gets "rewarded" in some way in the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zillman|first=D.|title=Suspense: Conceptualizations, theoretical analyses, and empirical explorations|year=1996|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=199–231|editor=Vorderer, P.|editor2=H.

*'''Modes of reception''': "Emotional involvement correlates with other modes of reception, especially with diegetic involvement (getting absorbed in the fictional world), socio-involvement (identifying with characters), and ego-involvement (relating the film to one's own life). ...Emotional involvement can be helpful for the pursuit of a broader variety of goals in the reception process. ... It can be concluded that the experience of emotions can be functional in a number of other ways than just regulating emotions in terms of affective valence and arousal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bartsch|first=Anne|author2=Reinhold Viehoff|title=The Use of Media Entertainment and Emotional Gratification|journal=Procedia Social and Behavioral Sciences|year=2010|volume=5|pages=2247–2255|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2010.07.444}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sückfull|first=M.|title=Rezeptionsmodalitäten.

*'''Intrinsic motivation''': If the user experiences a challenge to his or her media-related skills, but not to the point of being frustrated or overwhelmed, then the gratification is a reward in a feeling of competence that inspires the user to continue using the media in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vorderer|first=P|title=Psychology of Entertainment|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, NJ|author2=Steen, F. and Chan, E.|editor=Bryant, J.|editor2=Vorderer, P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Mood adjustment''': Users are gratified by using media to adjust their mood to whatever is currently happening. For instance, once already provoked by an aggressor and promised a chance to retaliate, males were found to prefer bad news over good news in that emotionally charged moment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knobloch|first=S.|title=Mood adjustment via mass communication|journal=Journal of Communication|year=2003|volume=53|pages=233–250|doi=10.1093/joc/53.2.233|url=https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/2027.42/72504/1/j.1460-2466.2003.tb02588.x.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Knobloch-Westerwick|first=S.|author2=Alter, S.|title=Mood adjustment to social situations through mass media use: How men ruminate and women dissipate angry moods|journal=Human Communication Research|year=2006|volume=32|pages=58–73|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.2006.00003.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Relationship functions of entertainment''': According to this particular branch of use and gratification, we use entertainment to apply lessons to or escape from our real-life relationships.

==Related theories==
===Media system dependency theory===
[[Media system dependency theory]] (MSDT or media dependency theory) has been studied as an offshoot of UGT. However, media dependency theory focuses on audiences' goals for media consumption as the source of their dependency; while uses and gratification theory focuses on audience's needs as drivers for media consumption. MSDT states that as a person becomes increasingly dependent on media to satisfy their needs, that media will become more important in a person's life and thereby have increased influence and effects that person. MSDT acknowledges and builds upon UGT because it is based on the assumptions that people have different uses for media that arise from their needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ball-Rokeach |first1=S.J. |last2=DeFleur |first2=M.L.|authorlink=Melvin Defleur|title=A dependency model of mass-media effects |journal=Communication Research |date=January 1976 |volume=3 |issue=1 |pages=3–21 |doi=10.1177/009365027600300101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social cognitive theory===
Building on UGT, [[Social Cognitive Theory]] helped distinguish GS versus GO stimulus for media consumption. Social cognitive theory explains behavior in terms of the reciprocal causation between individuals, environments, and behaviors. This allows for a more personal application of UGT instead of a large, blanketing assumption about a large audience of mass media. If GO is greater than GS then there will be more audience satisfaction. Lastly, audiences' GS are not always the reality of their GO.&lt;ref name=LaRose_2001 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Palmgreen_1985&gt;{{cite journal|last=Palmgreen|first=P|author2=L. Wenner|author3=K. Rosengren|title=Uses and gratifications research: The past ten years.|journal=Media gratifications research|year=1985|pages=1–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultivation theory===
[[Cultivation theory]] is concerned with understanding the role that media play in shaping a person's world view—specifically television. Whereas UGT tries to understand the motivations that drive media usage, Cultivation theory focuses on the psychological effects of media. Cultivation theory is used especially to study violence in television and how it shapes audience's understanding of the reality of violence in society. Often, because of media's influence, audiences have a more heightened and unrealistic perception of the amount of violence. A UGT approach may be implemented to Cultivation theory cases to understand why an audience would seek violent media and if audiences seek [[Research on the effects of violence in mass media|television violence]] to satisfy the need of confirmation of their worldview.

==Theory criticism==
Uses and gratifications has, almost since its inception, been viewed by some as the Pluto of communication theory, which is to say critics argue that it does not meet the standards necessary to be theory. Critics argue that it instead is more of an approach to analysis or a data-collecting strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, 2002; Severin and Tankard, 1997; McQuail 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the criticism most commonly raised in academic literature:
*Gratifications are more dependent on input by researchers than on decisions made by research subjects.&lt;ref name="Lometti, G. E. 1977"&gt;Lometti, G. E., Reeves, B., &amp; Bybee, C. R. (1977). Investigating the assumptions of uses and gratifications research. Communication Research, 4(3), 321-338.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Early research required participants to identify gratifications associated with specific channels of communication, raising the possibility that they would conflate gratifications and channels. Lometti et al. argued that this could "substantially overestimate" the number of gratifications, and that attempts to address it using in-depth interviews were problematic (p.&amp;nbsp;323).&lt;ref name="Lometti, G. E. 1977"/&gt;
*Audiences of different ages likely have different motivations for using identical media, and also likely have different gratifications.&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, B. S. (1974). Gratifications of television viewing and their correlates for British children. The uses of mass communications: Current perspectives on gratifications research, 3, 71-92.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Due to the individualistic nature of uses and gratification, it is difficult to take the information that is collected in studies. Most research relies on pure recollection of memory rather than data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elihu Katz|Katz, Elihu]], [[Jay Blumler|Jay G. Blumler]], and Michael Gurevitch. "Uses and Gratifications Research."The Public Opinion Quarterly 4th ser. 37 (1973–1974): 509-23. JSTOR. Web. 14 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes self-reports complicated and immeasurable.
*The theory has been denounced by media hegemony advocates who say it goes too far in claiming that people are free to choose the media and the interpretations they desire.&lt;ref&gt;Severin, W. J., &amp; Tankard, J. W. (1997). Uses of mass media. Communication theories: Origins, methods, and uses in the mass media.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Audiences interpret the media in their own terms and any debate for or against this can be argued, and depending on the circumstances, won by either side. Each individuals' actions and effects on those actions will depend solely on the situation. Each individual has unique uses to which the media attempts to meet their gratifications.

Using this sociologically-based theory has little to no link to the benefit of psychology due to its weakness in operational definitions and weak analytical mode. It also is focused too narrowly on the individual and neglects the social structure and place of the media in that structure. Ruggiero (2000) wrote that "most scholars agree that early research had little theoretical coherence and was primarily behaviorist and individualist in its methodological tendencies."&lt;ref name="Ruggiero, T. E. 2000"&gt;Ruggiero, T. E. (2000). Uses and gratifications theory in the 21st century. Mass communication &amp; society, 3(1), 3-37.&lt;/ref&gt; Blumler (1979) and other critics have argued that line between gratification and satisfaction is blurred, and Blumler wrote that "the nature of the theory underlying uses and gratifications research is not totally clear."&lt;ref&gt;Blumler, J. G. (1979). The role of theory in uses and gratifications studies. Communication research, 6(1), 9-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite such criticism, contemporary thought suggests that uses and gratifications as theory may be in the process of gaining new life as a result of new communication technology. While it was easy to question the agency of media consumers who had three television networks from which to choose, it's much harder to argue that a consumer who now has 100 cable channels and Internet-streaming video is not making his own decisions. Sundar &amp; Limperos (2013) write that what had been called the "audience" is now referred to as "users," and "usage implies volitional action, not simply passive reception."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Sundar|first1 = S. S.|last2 = Limperos|first2 = A. M.|year = 2013|title = Uses and Grats 2.0: New Gratifications for New Media|url =|journal = Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media|volume = 57|issue = 4| pages = 504–525|doi = 10.1080/08838151.2013.845827 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The active audience===
Among the most criticized tenets of uses and gratifications as theory is the assumption of an active audience. Ruggerio (2000) noted three assumptions that are necessary to the idea of active audience: First, media selection is initiated by the individual.&lt;ref name="Ruggiero, T. E. 2000"/&gt; Second, expectations regarding the use of media must be a product of individual predispositions, social interactions and environmental factors. And third, the active audience exhibits goal-directed behavior. This concept of active audience finds, at best, limited acceptance outside of the United States.&lt;ref name="Ruggiero, T. E. 2000"/&gt;

Jay Blumler presented a number of interesting points, as to why Uses and Gratifications cannot measure an active audience. He stated, "The issue to be considered here is whether what has been thought about Uses and Gratifications Theory has been an article of faith and if it could now be converted into an empirical question such as: How to measure an active audience?" (Blumler, 1979). Blumler then offered suggestions about the kinds of activity the audiences were engaging with in the different types of media.
*'''Utility''' : "Using the media to accomplish specific tasks"&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"&gt;West, Richard L., and Lynn H. Turner. "Uses and Gratifications Theory." Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2010. 392-401. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Intentionality''': "Occurs when people's prior motive determine use of media"&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
*'''Selectivity''': "Audience members' use of media reflect their existing interests"&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
*'''Imperviousness to Influence''': "Refers to audience members' constructing their own meaning from media content"&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;

25 years later, in 1972, Blumler, McQuail and Brown extended Lasswell's four groups. These included four primary factors for which one may use the media:&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;
*'''Diversion''': Escape from routine and problems; an emotional release&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;
*'''Personal Relationships''': Social utility of information in conversation; substitution of media for companionship&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;
*'''Personal Identity or Individual Psychology''': Value reinforcement or reassurance; self-understanding, reality exploration&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;
*'''Surveillance''': Information about factors which might affect one or will help one do or accomplish something&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

Katz, Gurevitch and Haas (1973) saw mass media as a means by which individuals connect or disconnect themselves with others. They developed 35 needs taken from the largely speculative literature on the social and psychological functions of the mass media and put them into five categories:
*'''Cognitive Needs''': Acquiring information, knowledge and understanding&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
**''Media Examples'': Television (news), video (how-to), movies (documentaries or based on history)
*'''Affective Needs''': Emotion, pleasure, feelings&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
**''Media Examples'': Movies, television (soap operas, sitcoms)
*'''Personal Integrative Needs''': Credibility, stability, status&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
**''Media Examples'': Video
*'''Social Integrative Needs''': Family and friends&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
**''Media Examples'': Internet (e-mail, instant messaging, chat rooms, social media)
*'''Tension Release Needs''': Escape and diversion&lt;ref name="WestTurner392401"/&gt;
**''Media Examples'': Television, movies, video, radio, internet

'''''VBS1''''' (Virtual Battlefield Systems 1) is a military simulator which relies heavily on modern [[game engine|game technology]] and is therefore generally referred to as a [[serious game]]. The platform is derived from the [[First-person narrative|first-person]] entertainment game [[Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis|Operation Flashpoint]] and is developed by [[Bohemia Interactive Australia]]. The system enables the practice of small unit [[military tactics]] in an [[interactive]] [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environment. The platform provides real-time scenario management facilities, customized vehicles and equipment, user-definable mission scenarios, and variable environmental conditions. This combination of military simulator functionality and modern gaming technology proved to be a success and resulted in a broad military customer base. [[VBS2]] is the successor of this platform.

==History==

The Virtual Battlespace Systems 1 concept was initially conceived in 2001 as the result of a business decision made between Bohemia Interactive Studio (BIS) and creator David Lagettie. The BIS [[computer game]] [[Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis|Operation Flashpoint]] (''OFP'') aimed for a highly realistic military [[gameplay]]. In order to achieve this the game featured large scale terrain areas combined with a high level of detail, an integrated [[topographic map]], a fully functional command and control system for small teams, and considerable flexibility in the [[game engine]]. These functionalities gave the game obvious [[military]] potential, and as a result [[Bohemia Interactive Australia|Bohemia Interactive Australia (BIA)]] was formed and given the task of converting the product explicitly for military purposes.

The first military [[customer]] for ''VBS1'' was the [[United States Marine Corps]] (USMC), who were provided ''VBS1'', a USMC addon pack and [[MOUT]] training facilities modelled to a high level of detail in late 2001. The majority of [[software development|development]] work was carried out by BIA, with [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] and limited development conducted by [[Coalescent Technologies]].

In 2002, the product was further developed, which resulted in the first versions of the ''VBS1'' [[After Action Review]] (AAR) and Observer being developed. The [[Real Virtuality (engine)|Real Virtuality]] engine was upgraded to version 1.94 in order to output data as required by the AAR system.

The [[Australian Defence Force]] (ADF) began conducting trials with ''VBS1'' in 2003, and a large amount of work was conducted by the [[Virtual Environments and Simulation Lab]] (VESL), part of the [[University of New South Wales]] at the Australian Defence Force Academy. VESL conducted (for the ADF) the [[Virtual Infantry Section Experiment]] (VISE), which was the first [[Analytic induction|analytical]] use of the product by a [[military organisation]].

The AAR 2 and Observer 2 were developed in 2003 in order to record the large quantities of data generated during VISE (previous versions were unable to handle more than a few [[squad]]s in the one [[scenario]]), and the engine was updated to version 1.99. This gave VBS1 an inherent and powerful data recording and mission playback capability.

''VBS1'' was refined and improved and underwent limited public release on May 21, 2004 (previously the product was only released to military (or similar) organisations). The release occurred primarily to increase awareness of the product and foster a user community.  Exclusive distribution rights for ''VBS1'' to North America was given to Coalescent Technologies, with BIA and BIS distributing to the rest of the world via the online shop.

The ADF conducted trials of ''VBS1'' in November 2004 as part of the VICE. The trials resulted in ''VBS1'' being recommended as a suitable [[training]] [[tool]] for a range of military purposes: from [[Infantry Minor Tactics]] through to [[combined arms]] operations. The results of the trial are summarized in the VESL paper "Proficient Soldier to Skilled Gamer: Training for COTS Success".

The ADF provided a large amount of feedback regarding the product and this resulted in engine updates and improvements to the AAR and Observer. The ''VBS1'' 2.07 patch was released in mid-2005 and also AAR 3 and Observer 3. In accordance with ADF requests, the ''VBS1'' Instructor [[User interface|Interface]] and also numerous [[convoy]] training enhancements were implemented. The ADF used these new features as part of pre-deployment training for the [[Al Muthanna Task Group 2]] ([[AMTG2]]), who were to deploy to [[Iraq]] in late 2005. BIA developed the town of [[As Samawah]] (as part of Terrain Pack 3) in ''VBS1'' to a high level of detail from [[photos]] and maps, and also a 50&amp;nbsp;km² [[Al Muthanna]] terrain area.

In 2005 computer game Operation Flashpoint was used by the US based company [[BBN Technologies]] to create [[DARWARS Ambush! Convoy Simulator]] a commercial military training product developed as part of the [[DARPA]] DARWARS program.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.virtualbattlespace.com/ambush.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, a ''VBS1'' enterprise license has been negotiated with the Australian Defence Force (ADF) and the New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF), which includes provision of ''VBS1'' and an update to ''[[VBS2]]'' for both the ADF and the NZDF.

In April 2006 was BIA chosen by Australian Defence Force (ADF) to develop a number of [[Loadmaster]] Virtual Reality Simulators (LVRS) utilizing ''VBS1'' simulator engine.

In August 2006 the USMC has purchased an enterprise license of Virtual Battlespace (VBS) covering an unlimited number of VBS1 and [[VBS2]] licenses. Two version of VBS1 delivered: 'VBS1 Developer' provides a fully functional product for use in simulation centers and 'VBS1 Lite' for wider distribution.

In November 2006 the [[John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School|United States Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School]] ([[USAJFKSWCS]]) has purchased a site license of Virtual Battlespace (VBS). The license provides a large number of VBS1 and VBS2 licenses to USAJFKSWCS.

==Features==

''VBS1'' offers realistic battlefield [[simulations]] and the ability to operate land, sea and air vehicles. Instructors may create new scenarios and then run the [[simulation]] from multiple viewpoints. The [[squad]] management system enables users to issue orders to squad members as well as coordinate both lethal and non-lethal tasks. ''VBS1'' allows free play within scenario-based training missions. It also incorporates simulation of wind, rain, fog, clouds, time of day, sunrise and sunset and tides.

''VBS1'' is based on a commercial [[Video game|game]] created by [[Bohemia Interactive Studio]]. It was designed for federal, state and local government agencies and can be specifically tailored to meet the individual needs of [[military]], law enforcement, [[homeland defense]], and [[first responder]] training environments. ''VBS1'' can be deployed over a [[LAN]] or through the [[Internet]] on both [[laptop computer|mobile]] and [[desktop computer]]s.

''VBS1'' may be used to teach doctrine, [[military tactics|tactics]], techniques, and procedures during squad and [[platoon]] [[Offensive (military)|offensive]], [[Defense (military)|defensive]], and [[patrolling]] operations. It may also be used to teach and rehearse security emergency response procedures in lethal and non-lethal environments. ''VBS1'' delivers a synthetic environment for the practical exercise of the leadership and organizational behavior skills required to successfully execute small unit missions.

VBS1 external client [[API]] has been used to create  [[High Level Architecture|HLA]] and [[Distributed Interactive Simulation|DIS]] gateways.

==Future==
The VBS1 system is also being evaluated for fielding in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Israel]], [[Singapore]], the [[Czech Republic]] and expanded fielding within the [[U.S. Marine Corps]] &amp; [[U.S. Navy]]. 
Also [[State of South Carolina]] has now joined the list of State, Federal, and Local governments ordering the VBS1 synthetic training system.

Thanks to LVC (Live-Virtual-Constructive) Game by [[Calytrix]], VBS1 and VBS2 will also be integrated into the USMC [[DVTE]] network, seamlessly interoperating with simulations such as [[JSAF]]. The DVTE will soon leverage a wide range of VBS2 enhancements including command and control functionality, modifiable agent-based [[AI]] and real-time mission editing.

VBS1 and VBS2 may also be integrated with [[C2PC]] to provide a high-fidelity, networked environment linking the live and virtual domains (live marines in the field, tracked by [[GPS]], interoperating with virtual entities controlled from within a USMC simulation centre).

==Developers and distributors==
''VBS1'' was developed by [http://www.bistudio.com *[[Bohemia Interactive Australia]]] (division of [http://www.bistudio.com *Bohemia Interactive Studio]) with limited amount of development managed by [http://www.virtualbattlefieldsystems.com *[[Coalescent Technologies]]].

''VBS1'' is in distribution worldwide by [http://www.virtualbattlespace.com *Bohemia Interactive Studio] and [http://www.bistudio.com *[[Bohemia Interactive|Bohemia Interactive Australia]]] division.

Prior to March 2006 was ''VBS1'' distribution in North America handled by [http://www.virtualbattlefieldsystems.com *[[Coalescent Technologies]]].

The '''World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD)''' is a [[CEO]]-led organization of over 200 [[multinational company|international companies]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/About-us|title=About us|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Council is also connected to 60 national and regional buisness councils and partner organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.geneve-int.ch/world-business-council-sustainable-development-wbcsd-0|title=World Business Council for Sustainable Development - WBCSD {{!}} Genève Internationale|website=www.geneve-int.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Its origins date back to the Rio de Janeiro [[Earth Summit]] of 1992,&lt;ref name=WBCSD/&gt; when [[Stephan Schmidheiny]], a Swiss business entrepreneur, was appointed chief adviser for business and industry to the secretary general of the [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Memo to Rio+20: 'green economy' doesn't mean monetising nature|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/may/29/rio-20-green-economy-monetising-nature|website=www.theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He created a forum called "Business Council for Sustainable Development", which went on to become ''Changing Course'', a book that coined the concept of [[eco-efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eco-Efficiency|url=http://www.smartcommunities.ncat.org/business/ecoeffic.shtml|website=www.smartcommunities.ncat.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WBCSD was created in 1995 in a merger of the Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Industry Council for the Environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= THE ICC &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT|url=http://archive.corporateeurope.org/icc/icc_environment.html|website=archive.corporateeurope.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is based at the [[Maison de la paix]] in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World Business Council for Sustainable Development|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/globalwarming/n721.xml|website=knowledge.sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offices in New York and New Delhi.

==Operations==
The Council works on a variety of issues related to sustainable development. It works to achieve the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) through the transformation of six economic systems. These are Circular Economy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Circular-Economy|title=Circular Economy - World business council for sustainable development|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Cities and Mobility&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Cities-and-Mobility|title=Cities and Mobility|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Climate and Energy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Climate-and-Energy|title=Energy &amp; Circular Economy|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Food, Land and Water&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Food-Land-Water|title=Food, Land &amp; Water|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, People&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/People|title=People|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Redefining Value&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Programs/Redefining-Value|title=Redefining Value|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Each system transformation is set up as a WBCSD Program with a number of supplementary Projects&lt;ref&gt;https://docs.wbcsd.org/2018/11/Value.Impact.Voice.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Impact and influence==
A 2003 [[World Bank]]/[[International Finance Corporation|IFC]] commissioned study  identified the WBCSD as one of the "most influential forums" for companies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resourcesaver.org/file/toolmanager/CustomO16C45F49313.pdf Race to the Top: Attracting and Enabling Global Sustainable Business]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 [[Globescan]] survey found the WBCSD as the second most effective SD research organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://surveys.globescan.com/sdroleaders/sose04-2_resorg.pdf 2004 Globescan Survey of Sustainability Experts]&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2006 survey by the same company reports that 54% of all surveyed experts believe the WBCSD will play a "major role" in advancing sustainable development. Only the European Union received higher approval (69%).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpi.cam.ac.uk/PDF/Aug%202006.pdf Cambridge Sustainability Research Digest]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2007's [[Ethisphere Institute]] list of the 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics, WBCSD President Bjoern Stigson has been ranked 9th, which made him the 2nd most influential NGO leader.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethisphere.com/influential/ 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210162230/http://ethisphere.com/influential/ |date=2012-02-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Membership of the WBCSD is by invitation of the Executive Committee to companies committed to [[sustainable development]]. Among its over 180 members&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/Our-members&lt;/ref&gt; are well-known companies such as [[DuPont]], [[3M]], [[Nestlé]], [[BP]], [[Danone]] and [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. WBCSD provides its members with the '''value, impact and voice''' to navigate unprecedented global changes and allows them to prosper from transforming their operations. By joining the WBCSD, member companies benefit from insights into the latest knowledge on sustainability, sustainability tools, peer collaboration across the value chain, participation in policy development and a chance to profile their sustainability work&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbcsd.org/Overview/Our-members|title=Our members|website=World business council for sustainable development|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Member companies pledge their support and contribution to the WBCSD by making available their knowledge and experience, and appropriate human resources. They are asked to publicly report on their environmental performance and to aspire to widen their reporting to cover all three pillars of sustainable development - economic, social and environmental.

A key element is the personal commitment of the [[Chief executive officer|Chief Executive Officers]] (CEOs), acting as Council Members. They are influential advocates for the WBCSD’s policy positions and they co-chair the working groups. They also organize support for the WBCSD’s work program and ensure the adoption of sustainable management practices within their companies.

===Forética===
Forética claims to be global network of [[Spanish language|Spanish speaking]] businesses and professionals whose mission is to promote an ethical management and corporate social responsibility by the establishment of a National standard in Spain known as SGE-21, (sistema de gestación ética para siglo 21) which is also Annex 1 to [[ISO 26000]] and supported by [[Corporate social responsibility|CSR]] Europe &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csr-supplychain.org/ CSR Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;
Membership is said to around 400 and includes companies of all sizes and sectors, as well as individual specialists, professionals and academics and it was incorporated into WBCSD on 2 September 2014 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbcsd.org/Pages/eNews/eNewsDetails.aspx?ID=16293&amp;NoSearchContextKey=true Leading Spanish think-tank Forética joins WBCSD’s Global Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

According to Greenpeace the ''World Business Council for Sustainable Development '' is among the key players responsible for holding the world societies from tackling the [[climate change]] and energy management challenges for the past 20 years. The WBCSD Executive Committee was dominated by the largest nonrenewable energy and carbon-intensive companies in the world at least until 2011. According to Greenpeace the WBCSD executive committee has been a ‘Who’s Who’ of the world’s largest carbon-intensive companies.&lt;ref name=GP2010&gt;[http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/climate/2011/391%20-%20WhosHoldingUsBack.pdf Who's holding us back?Full report] November 23, 2011 page 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sierra Club]] has collaborated with the World Business Council on a number of initiatives, as well as inviting its representatives to speak at Sierra Club events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/rocky-mountain-chapter/calendar-2 |title=Calendar &amp;#124; Sierra Club |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.austineconetwork.com/content/austin-sierra-club-monthly-meeting |title=Austin Sierra Club monthly meeting &amp;#124; Austin EcoNetwork |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Environmental Defense Fund]] recommends the World Business Council's auditing methods to companies seeking to reduce greenhouse emissions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/GHG_roadmap_Final.pdf |title=www.edf.org |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] has drawn upon WBCSD guidelines in drawing up their own guidelines for determining biofuels sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nrdc.org/energy/files/biofuels-sustainability-certification-report.pdf |title=Biofuel Sustainability Performance Guidelines |accessdate=2015-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The WBCSC's Vision 2020 report was highlighted by [[The Guardian]] as "the largest concerted corporate sustainability action plan to date – include reversing the damage done to ecosystems, addressing rising greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring societies move to sustainable agriculture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainability-case-studies-world-business-council |title=World Business Council for Sustainable Development: Vision 2050 &amp;#124; Guardian Sustainable Business &amp;#124; The Guardian |format= |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
