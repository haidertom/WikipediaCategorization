      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7022">'''Art historical photo archives''' (or photoarchives) are collections of reproductions of works of art that document paintings, drawings, prints, sculpture, architecture and sometimes installation photos. They are essential resource tools for the study of art history.  Image collections deepen understanding of specific objects of art and the careers of individual artists as they also provide the means for a comparative approach to the study of artists’ works, national schools and period styles.  The documentation that accompanies the images can also reveal patterns of art collecting, art market fluctuations and the changeable nature of public opinion.  Photo archives build their collections and gather documentation for the works of art they record through purchases, gifts and photography campaigns.  Information about ownership, condition, attribution, and subject identification is recorded at the time of acquisition and is frequently updated.

==History==

The  founders of important art historical photo archives believed that a deep and broad visual knowledge was necessary for the study of art history.   These pioneers,  including [[Richard Hamann]], [[Aby Warburg]], [[Sir Robert Witt]], [[William Martin Conway]], [[Bernard Berenson]], [[Cornelis Hofstede de Groot]] and [[Helen Clay Frick]], were the first to realize the potential of photography as a means to provide researchers with materials that strengthen the documentation and interpretation of works of art.   The photo archives they founded in the first half of the 20th century, now part of [[FotoMarburg]], the [[Warburg Institute]], the [[Witt Library]],  [[Villa I Tatti]], the [[Rijksbureau voor Kunsthistorische Documentatie]], and the [[Frick Art Reference Library Photoarchive]],  are still used by countless researchers in the first half of the 21st century.

==Uses==

*Art historical photo archives collect images of works without regard to trends or the popular reception of any given artist’s work. They thus retain files for artists not held in high esteem but whose reputations among scholars may change in years to come.
*Many of the works of art recorded in photo archives are unpublished or relatively inaccessible since they reside in private collections or public institution storerooms.
*Art historical photo archives provide a forum for scholarly dialogue across the decades, affording art historians the opportunity to record opinions regarding attribution or current ownership of works they know well.
*As art history and art connoisseurship have matured, photo archives have played a key role, the fruits of which are most obvious in publications such as Bernard Berenson’s lists of works by Italian artists and Richard Offner’s Corpus of Florentine Painting (today continued by Miklos Boskovits).  The refinement of attributions of works of art recorded in a photo archive can lead to the reevaluation of an artist’s career or the identification of a new, previously unnamed master.  In this way, a photo archive functions in much the same way as the curatorial records of museum drawings departments, where annotations by scholars of several generations record the various attributions ascribed to the work over time.
*Photo archives aid researchers in their connoisseurship skills since they include copies, forgeries and pastiches.
*Multiple images of a single work of art help scholars trace the physical changes that have affected the object through time, damage, and conservation.  Photo archives often document the full visual record of a given work of art, information that is unlikely to be published because of financial limitations.
*Photo archives enable discovery and innovative scholarship as researchers browse within and across artist files.
*Photo archives are essential to the study of works of art that have been destroyed or lost as a result of war, fire or theft.

==Future==

In 2009 the Courtauld Institute in collaboration with the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florenz organized a series of conferences that were held in  London, Florence and New York to discuss the future of photo archives.  They felt that an examination of the origins of photo archives can help guide and shape their future and, at the same time, convey to the uninitiated how image resources continue to be used as essential elements for art historical research. Few doubt that if Helen Frick, Robert Witt, or W.M. Conway had lived to see the potential of digitizing the photo archives they established in the 1920s, they would have dedicated enormous resources and careful thought to realizing the digital future.  However, there is a problem for photo archives in that currently they have no copyright claim to the majority of the images in their collection and thus they are unable to display them on the web.  It is therefore now their task to develop and promote a new model for access and use of these extraordinary resources that will maximize the opportunities of current and future technical advances in a way that suits the demands of today’s scholars.  This selection process, which is implicit in digitization projects and will inevitably exclude some images, renders the analog archive as indispensable as ever in the digital era.  Whatever the method of delivery, whether the photograph itself or its digital surrogate, photo archives remain essential to the study of art history.  The conferences produced the [[Florence Declaration]], which made several recommendations for the preservation of analogue photo archives.  As of May 2011, nearly 500 scholars had signed the Declaration.

'''Atomic Age''' in [[design]] refers to the period roughly corresponding to 1940–1960, when concerns about [[nuclear war]] dominated [[Western culture|Western society]] during the [[Cold War]]. Architecture, industrial design, commercial design (including advertising), interior design, and fine arts were all influenced by the themes of atomic science, as well as the [[Space Age]], which coincided with that period. Atomic Age design became popular and instantly recognizable, with a use of atomic motifs and space age symbols. [[Retrofuturism]] is a current resurgence of interest in Atomic Age design.
[[File:Theme building LAX AIRPORT (10629344455).jpg|thumb|[[Theme Building]] in [[Los Angeles International Airport]].]]

==Vital forms==
"Vital forms", or abstract organic forms, were identified as a core motif in the 2001 exhibition of Atomic Age design at the [[Brooklyn Museum of Art]], titled "Vital forms: American art and design in the atomic age, 1940–1960".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rapaport, Brooke Kamin and Kevin Stayton|title=Vital Forms: American Art and Design in the Atomic Age, 1940–1960|year=2001|publisher=Brooklyn Museum of Art in association with Harry N. Abrams, 2001|isbn=978-0-87273-145-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atomic power was a paradox during the era. It held great promise of technological solutions for the problems facing an increasingly complex world; at the same time, people were fearful of a nuclear armageddon, after the use of the atomic bomb at the end of World War II. People were ever-aware of the potential good, and lurking menace, in technology. Science became more visible in the mainstream culture through Atomic Age design.

Atomic particles themselves were reproduced in visual design, in areas ranging from architecture to [[barkcloth]] patterns. The geometric atomic patterns that were produced in textiles, industrial materials, [[melamine]] counter tops, dishware and wallpaper, and many other items, are emblematic of Atomic Age design. The Space Age interests of the public also began showing up in Atomic Age designs, with star and galaxy motifs appearing with the atomic graphics.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
Free-form organic shapes also appear as a recurring theme in Atomic Age design. British designers at the [[Council of Industrial Design]] (CoID) produced fabrics in the early 1950s that showed "skeletal plant forms, drawn in a delicate, spidery graphic form", reflecting x-ray technology that was becoming more widespread and familiar in pop culture. These botanic designs influenced later Atomic Age patterns that included repeating organic shapes similar to cells and organisms viewed through a microscope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jackson|first=Leslie|title=Twentieth Century Pattern Design|year=2007|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|isbn=978-1-56898-712-5|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are similarities between many Atomic Age designs and the [[mid-century modern]] trend of the same time. Elements of Atomic Age and Space Age design were dominant in the [[Googie]] design movement in commercial buildings in the United States. Some streamlined industrial designs also echoed the influence of [[futurism]] that had been seen much earlier in [[Art Deco]] design.

==Space Age design==
Whereas Atomic Age motifs and structures leaned towards design fields such as architecture and industrial design, Space Age design spread into a broader range of consumer products, including clothing fashion, and even animation styles, as with the popular television show ''[[The Jetsons]]''. Beginning with the dawn of the Space Age (commonly attributed to the launch of [[Sputnik]] in October, 1957&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dickson|first=Paul|title=A Dictionary of the Space Age|year=2009|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-9115-1|pages=187}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Space Age design captured the optimism and faith in technology that was felt by much of society during the 1950s and 1960s. Space Age design also had a more [[vernacular]] character, appearing in accessible forms that quickly became familiar to mainstream consumers. Space Age design became more closely associated with [[kitsch]] and with [[Googie]] architecture for popular commercial buildings such as diners, bowling alleys, and shops. "Space Age design is closely tied to the pop movement [...] the fusion of popular culture, art, design, and fashion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elder|first=Alan|title=Made in Canada: Craft and Design in the Sixties|year=2005|publisher=McGill-Queen's|isbn=978-0-7735-2873-4|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fashion===
[[File:Go-go boots by Andre Courreges, 1965.jpg|thumb|Go-go boots by Andre Courreges, 1965.]]
[[File:Flying Saucer dress by Issey Miyake, Japan, 1994.jpg|thumb|[[Issey Miyake]]'s "Flying Saucer" dress.]]
Two of the most well-known fashion designers to use Space Age themes in their designs were [[Pierre Cardin]] and [[Paco Rabanne]]. Pierre Cardin established the futuristic trend of using synthetic and industrial materials in fashion, with "forward thinking" innovations in his early 1960s work. Cardin "popularized the use of everyday materials for fashion items, like vinyl and metal rings for dresses, carpentry nails for [[brooch]]es, and common decorative effects such as geometric cut-outs, [[appliqué]]s, large pockets, helmets and oversized buttons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stecker|first=Pamela|title=The Fashion Design Manual|year=1996|publisher=Macmillan Educational AU|isbn=978-0-7329-0716-7|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, Cardin launched his "space age" line, and [[André Courrèges]] showed his "Moon Girl" collection, introducing the white [[go-go boot]] style and other icons of the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fashion Reader: Second Edition|year=2011|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84788-590-6|pages=100|editor=Linda Welters, Abby Lillethu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese designer, [[Issey Miyake]] from Hiroshima, worked in Paris and New York from 1964 to 1970, and used many atomic age forms, and technologically produced materials in his work. In 1970 he moved to Tokyo to continue these innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=English|first1=Bonnie|title=Japanese Fashion Designers: The Work and Influence of Issey Miyaki, Yohji Yamamoto, and Rei Kawakubo|date=2013|publisher=Berg|isbn=9780857850546|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xRc4AAAAQBAJ&amp;dq=issey+miyake+monograph&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miyake cites his first encounter with design as two bridges his home-town, [[Hiroshima]] at the hypocenter of the atomic bombing of the city in WWII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miyake|first1=Issey|title=The Concepts and Work of Issey Miyake|url=http://mds.isseymiyake.com/im/en/work/|website=Issey Miyake {{!}} 三宅一生|publisher=The Miyake Issey Foundation|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vernacular architecture===
[[File:Dingbat samoPerdy.jpg|thumb|Example of "dingbat" apartment facade.]]
The dingbat apartment house, ubiquitous in the Los Angeles, California area were built between 1945 through the 1960s, fused a purist style with googie influence. The architect, Francis Ventre, coined the term "dingbat" for these quickly built stucco and frame simple structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Piercy|first1=Clive|title=Pretty Vacant: The Los Angeles Dingbat Observed|date=2003|publisher=Chronicle Books|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-8118-4024-7|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Pretty_Vacant.html?id=lZ6vvMKtFV4C|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These structures often had a single exterior ornament in the shape of a starburst, boomerang, or pattern of rectangles.

===Architecture===
[[File:Chemosphere 2012.jpg|thumb|Chemosphere house, Los Angeles.]]
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosa|first1=Joseph|last2=McCoy|first2=Esther|title=A Constructed View: The Architectural Photography of Julius Shulman|date=1994|publisher=Rizzoli International Publications, Inc|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780847817771|url=http://www.rizzoliusa.com/book.php?isbn=9780847817771}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Chemosphere]] house, designed by [[John Lautner]] in 1960, has become an icon of the atomic age home. The octagonal shaped house is cantilevered on a steep slope in the Hollywood Hills, California. At the time, [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] cited it as the "most modern home built in the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Timberg|first1=Scott|title=Landmark Houses: John Lautner's Chemosphere|url=http://www.latimes.com/home/la-hm-landmark-houses-john-lautner-chemosphere-htmlstory.html|accessdate=7 December 2015|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designers==
Some of the leading designers who employed the Atomic Age style in their works include:
* [[Charles Eames]]
* [[Ray Eames]]
* [[Pierre Koenig]]
* [[Virgil Exner]]
* [[Richard Neutra]]
* [[Eero Saarinen]]
* [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]

[[File:Gebrüder Adam - Maler.jpg|thumb|250px|The Adam Brothers (1848), by Benno Adam, on the left.]]
'''Benno Rafael Adam''' (15 July 1812, [[Munich]] - 8 March 1892, [[Kelheim]]) was a German animal painter.

==Life==
He was the eldest son of the painter [[Albrecht Adam]], and distinguished himself especially by his depictions of game animals, hunting dogs and pets in larger compositions (deer and boar hunting, fox baiting, etc.) He was associated with the [[Chiemsee]] artists' colony.

In addition to his paintings, he illustrated several textbooks and manuals, including ''Anleitung zur Rindviehzucht und zur verschiedenartigen Benutzung des Hornviehs'' (Guide to Beef Cattle Breeding and the Diverse Use of Horned Cattle) by [[Heinrich Wilhelm von Pabst]], J. G. Cotta, Stuttgart (1851).

In the summer of 1834, he married Josepha Quaglio, the eldest daughter of the painter and architect [[Domenico Quaglio the Younger|Domenico Quaglio]]. Their son [[Emil Adam]] also became a painter. Benno Adam's brothers were the painters [[Franz Adam|Franz]] and [[Eugen Adam]].

[[Pope Innocent X]] granted recognition to the lay Confraternity of Santo Cristo Jesús Nazareno in 1650 for the promotion of the devotion to Jesus through the icon.&lt;ref name="Melton2011p118"/&gt; It was housed in several churches near Manila in the early decades, arriving in Quiapo Church in 1787 where it has been enshrined ever since.&lt;ref name="Melton2011p118"/&gt; The icon is renowned in the Philippines and is considered by many [[Catholic Church in the Philippines|Filipino Catholics]] to be [[miracle|miraculous]]; its mere touch reputed to cure disease.&lt;ref name="Lyden2009p184"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melton2011p118"/&gt; It attracts homage by numerous devotees and major processions every year.&lt;ref name="Melton2011p118"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John N.

The image (in recent years a composite replica) is brought out of its shrine in procession three times a year: January 9 (the anniversary of the icon's [[Translation (relics)|translation]]), [[Good Friday]] (the Nazarene's liturgical feast, commemorating the culmination of the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]]), and December 31 ([[New Year's Eve]], the first day of its annual [[novena]]).&lt;ref name="Melton2011p118"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Lyden|title=The Routledge Companion to Religion and Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZEGMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA184 |year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-22065-5|pages=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt; The January 9 procession re-enacts the image's ''Traslación'' (literally "transfer") in 1787&lt;!--Please do not change Traslación to TraNslacion; the first is the correct term, and is Spanish for "transfer" or "passage of movement".--&gt;, or "solemn transfer" to the Minor Basilica from its original shrine inside [[Intramuros]].&lt;ref name="Murphy2015p150"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jean-Guy A.

The Black Nazarene is venerated by Filipino devotees every Friday. Along with the ''[[Santo Niño de Cebú|Santo Niño]]'', (Child Jesus) it is the most popular object of devotion in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="Wainwright2006p674"&gt;{{cite book|author=Geoffrey Wainwright|title=The Oxford History of Christian Worship |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h5VQUdZhx1gC&amp;pg=PA674 |year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-513886-3|page=674}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar image called ''[[Cristo Negro (Portobelo)|Cristo Negro]]'' is venerated in [[Portobelo]], [[Panama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.

==Terminology==
The image derives its name from "[[Nazarene (title)|Nazarene]]", a title of Christ identifying him as a native of [[Nazareth]] in [[Galilee]] and from its dark complexion – something uncommon amongst Philippine depictions of Jesus.

The ''Traslación'' procession is taken from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term for [[Translation (relic)|translation]], referring to "passage" or "movement".

===''Ándas''===
The image's wooden base is referred to as the ''peana'' while its carriage or ''carroza'' used in [[procession]]s is called the ''Ándas'' (from the Spanish ''andar'', "to move forward"). The term ''ándas'' commonly refers to the shoulder-borne [[palanquin]]s of religious images and was retained for the icon’s carriage which replaces the palanquins used in processions up until the late 20th century.

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Black Nazarene altar.jpg|thumb|The image enshrined above the [[high altar]] of the [[Quiapo Church|Minor Basilica of the Black Nazarene]], Manila.]]
The image was made by an anonymous [[Mexican people|Mexican]] sculptor, and the image arrived in Manila via [[galleon]] from [[Acapulco]], Mexico, on May 31, 1606. Traditional accounts attribute the colour to [[votive candles]] burning before the image, although the most widespread belief is that it was charred by a fire on the galleon that brought it from Mexico.

[[Monsignor]] Sabino A. Vengco Jr. from [[Ateneo de Manila University#Loyola School of Theology (federated unit)|Loyola School of Theology]] meanwhile noted that the image was not charred but in fact dark through to its core, as it was carved from [[mesquite]] wood. Vengco based this claim on personal research in Mexico, where he said the wood was a popular medium in the period the image was carved. He also likened it to [[Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage|Our Lady of Antipolo]], another popular image of similar provenance and appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=De Guzman|first1=Odi|title=Black or white: The Nazarene and the Pinoy devotion|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/400551/lifestyle/artandculture/black-or-white-the-nazarene-and-the-pinoy-devotion|accessdate=10 January 2015|agency=GMA News Online|date=8 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the image from Mexico (which belonged to the Recollects) was enshrined in the ''retablo mayor'' (high altar) of the Church of Saint [[Nicholas of Tolentino]] (also popularly known as the "Recoletos Church", located some distance away from modern-day Rizal Park) inside [[Intramuros]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.flickr.com/photos/johntewell/25776962904/ Inside view of Recoletos Church, Intramuros, Manila, Philippines, 1905 by John Tewell]&lt;/ref&gt; Both church and image perished during the bombardment and the flames of the [[Liberation of Manila]] in 1945.

A still-persistent common misconception is that the icon in Quiapo Church is the "lost" original image. On January 9, 1787, the Recollects [[Translation (relic)|donated a copy of the image]] to the [[Quiapo Church|Church of the Camisa]] (one of Quiapo Church's original names), which later on was celebrated by the faithful every January 9 by means of a procession (henceforth called the ''Traslación'') from Intramuros (its original home, San Nicolás de Tolentino Church; later on outside Rizal Park) to Quiapo.

While the "lost" original image was always in the main altar away from the crowds, leaving only for a procession on [[Palm Sunday]], the image enshrined in Quiapo, which has withstood four centuries of fires, earthquakes, and the [[World War II in the Philippines|Second World War]], was available for physical veneration by its devotees who have attested to its miraculous powers.

The image presently enshrined above the main altar of Quiapo Church is a composite of the surviving copy's head and a replica sculpted by renowned Filipino ''[[Santo (art)|santero]]'' (saint-maker) Gener Maglaqui, who was commissioned by the [[Archdiocese of Manila]]. The other composite comprises the surviving copy's body and the head of the Maglaqui replica. Enshrined in a different part of the Basilica, it is the second composite which is used in the three major processions. This arrangement began in the 1990s because of security concerns and to better protect the icon; until then, the image donated in the 18th century was used in whole during processions.

==Description==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
The Black Nazarene's head wears a braided [[wig]] made of dyed [[abaca]], along with a golden [[crown of thorns]]. Attached to the crown are the traditional "''Tres Potencias''" ("three powers") [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], symbolising the three powers of the [[Holy Trinity]]. These three ''rayos'' ("rays"), an angular variant of the [[Halo (religious iconography)#In Christian art|cruciform halo]], are exclusively used for images of Jesus Christ in traditional Filipino and [[Hispanic]] iconography to signify his [[Divinity of Jesus|divinity]]. The original image has lost several fingers over the centuries.

The barefoot image is shown in a [[genuflecting]] posture, symbolising the agony and the weight of the Cross, along with the overall pain Christ endured during his Passion. The Cross itself is of black wood tipped with flat, pyramidal gilt brass caps.

=== Vestments ===
The image is dressed in a heavy velvet [[tunic]] of [[maroon (color)|maroon]], embroidered with floral and plant emblems in [[gold thread]], and trimmed with matching [[lace]] [[collar (clothing)|collar]] and [[cuff]]s. Around the waist is a gold-plated metal belt embossed with the word "NAZARENO", while a golden chain ending spheres is looped around the neck and held in the left hand, representing the [[Flagellation of Christ|Scourging]].

The image's vestments are changed in the ''Pabihis'' ("dressing") ritual, which is done by a priest vested in a [[cope]] and [[stole (vestment)|stole]], and devotees either inside the Basilica or outside in Plaza Miranda. It is performed five times a year during preparations for major religious occasions, and is open to the public.

=== ''Traslación'' ===
[[File:Feast of Black Nazarene, Quiapo, Manila.JPG|350px|thumbnail|right|Marshals in yellow lift the Black Nazarene onto its ''ándas'' at the start of the ''Traslación''. The ''peana'' or base of the image can be seen under the hem of its robes.]]
Every January 9, the ''Traslación'' of the Black Nazarene (commemorating the "solemn transfer" of the image's copy from San Nicolás de Tolentino in Intramuros to Quiapo) makes its way along the streets of Quiapo, with attendees reaching up to 12 million. In recent years a persistent misconception has the ''Traslación'' being repeatedly referred to (by the media as well as unscrupulous politicians) as mostly the "Feast of the Black Nazarene" (''Pistá ng Itím na Nazareno''), and sometimes the "Feast of Quiapo" (''Pistá ng Quiapo''), which despite the chaotic yet festive atmosphere are far from correct: the Black Nazarene's liturgical commemoration is on [[Good Friday]] (the second date of the year on which the image is processed). The basilica's parochial feast day, meanwhile, is on June 24 (concurrent with [[Public holidays in the Philippines#Local observance|Manila Day]]) – the [[Nativity of St John the Baptist|birthday]] of its [[patron saint|titular]], [[John the Baptist]].

In recent years, the processional route was altered due to a rise in accidents, to afford other neighbourhoods off the traditional route a chance to participate, and because of structural deficiencies in nearby bridges. It is normally only a school holiday for the schools near the processional route, but for the first time in the city's history, [[Mayor of Manila]] [[Joseph Estrada]] in 2014 declared the day a special non-working holiday due to the impassability of some thoroughfares and projected congestion in others.

As per custom, the Black Nazarene leaves the Minor Basilica a day or two before the annual procession, either in a public fashion or clandestinely. Since 2016, the procession begins at around 05:30 AM [[Philippine Standard Time|PST]] ([[GMT+8]]) after a solemn Midnight Mass at the [[Quirino Grandstand]] (usually presided by the Rector of the Minor Basilica but with the [[Archbishop of Manila]] preaching the sermon), followed hours later by Morning Prayer of the [[Liturgy of the Hours]]. It ends in Quiapo in late night of the same day or early the following morning, depending on how long the image has travelled. Some participants choose to wait for the image inside the Minor Basilica to greet it, while most devotees walk throughout the whole processional route. All devotees wear [[maroon (color)|maroon]] and yellow like the image, and they walk barefoot as a form of [[penance]] and in emulation of Christ's walk to [[Golgotha]]. Authorities estimate that over 500,000 devotees strode barefoot in the 2013 procession, which was attended by 9 million people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2013/01/10/895376/9m-devotees-attended-black-nazarene-feast '9M devotees attended Black Nazarene feast']&lt;/ref&gt; Attendees include families of devotees, tourists, and members of devotees' associations throughout the country and overseas, all carrying their long ''estandartes'' (religious [[gonfalon]]) usually coloured maroon or white and embroidered in gold and emblazoned with the image and the association name.

[[File:Traslacíon 2014, sea of devotees around the andas.jpg|thumb|right|Devotees around the "Ándas" of the Black Nazarene]]
The Black Nazarene is processed upon the ''Ándas'', and traditionally only men were permitted to be ''mamámasán'' ("bearers"), the devotees pulling the wheeled ''Ándas'' by its two large ropes. In recent years, female ''mamámasán'' have been allowed to participate, with pregnant women barred for safety reasons. There is also the custom of vying to touch the ''Kanang Balikat'', or the rope to the side of the image’s right shoulder. Folk belief holds it to possesses great sanctity, as it is closer to imitating the image bearing the Cross.

Marshals from the Minor Basilica, known as the ''Hijos del Nazareno'' ("Sons of the Nazarene"), form an honour guard around the image, and are the only people permitted to ride the ''Ándas'' for the duration of the ''Traslación''. The ''Hijos'' – distinguishes from maroon-clad devotees by their yellow and white shirts – have the primary task of protecting the icon from damage and directing the ''mamámasán'' in front and behind using hand gestures, voice commands (sometimes through a [[megaphone]]), and whistle signals. In addition, they help devotees clamber up onto the ''Ándas'' to briefly touch the icon’s cross, and wipe the image with cloths tossed at them. The wiping of cloth on the image, which is also done during the ''Pahalík'' ("kissing") ritual held the eve of the ''Traslación'', follows the folk belief that cloth can absorb the powers of a holy object (usually and specifically its curative abilities). This sanctity through contact descends from the ancient custom of ''ex brandea'' (cloth wiped on the bodies or tombs of the [[Twelve Apostles]]), itself part of the wider category of [[Relic#Roman Catholic classification and prohibitions|Third-class relics]].

====Injuries and casualties====
The ''Traslación'' is also notorious for the casualties that result from the jostling and congestion of the crowds pulling the ''Ándas''. The injuries and even deaths of devotees are brought upon by one or several factors including heat, fatigue, or being trampled upon by the crowd. 

====Length====
The 2012 ''Traslación'' is currently the longest in the image's recorded history as it ended 22 hours after leaving the Grandstand, arriving at Plaza Miranda around 05:15 AM PST the next day (January 10). The procession took longer than usual since the wheels of the ''Ándas'' broke early on at a point near [[Manila Hotel]], while the rope broke some distance away near [[Liwasang Bonifacio]]. 

There were also reports of groups of devotees diverting the image from the previously defined route in order to pass by business establishments outside the traditional route. This illicit act was done to allow homes and businesses off the planned route to receive the good luck and blessings of the image. &lt;ref&gt;http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/125633/longest-ever-black-nazarene-procession-ends&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The ''Dungaw'' Rite ===
On January 9, 2014, the traditional ''Dungaw'' (a Tagalog [[calque]] of the rite's Spanish name ''Mirata'', "to see" or "to view") was revived and reincorporated into the ''Traslación'' after the discovery of old documents attesting to its practise. The rite, which was discontinued in the early 1900s for still-unknown reasons, involves the Black Nazarene, coming from R. Hidalgo Street, being made to stop briefly at Plaza del Carmen, a square along the southwest flank of the [[neo-gothic]] [[Basilica of San Sebastian, Manila|Basílica Menor de San Sebastián]], before proceeding towards Bilibid Viejo Street.

After the recitation of the [[rosary]] by congregants inside San Sebastián, the resident Recollect priests remove the image of [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] from the principal niche of the ''retablo mayor''. The image, which was given to the Recollects in 1617 by a [[Carmelite]] nunnery in [[Mexico City]], is then solemnly and silently processed to a temporary scaffold erected at the southwest face of the church. There, it is lifted up by several priests to "see" and "meet" the Black Nazarene as devotees fall silent, with several prayers (often the [[Lord’s Prayer]]), being chanted fervently.&lt;ref name=Dungaw&gt;{{cite web|last=de Castro|first=Jay|title=UPDATE {{!}} MGA DEBOTO, NAKAABANG NA SA SAN SEBASTIAN CHURCH PARA SA 'MIRATA' O 'DUNGAW'|url=http://n5e.interaksyon.com/videos/5F17A309A94549B/17/update-mga-deboto-nakaabang-na-sa-san-sebastian-church-para-sa-mirata-o-dungaw|publisher=TV 5|accessdate=January 9, 2014|language=Tagalog|date=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, the priests slowly turn the Virgin's image so that it "watches" the Black Nazarene and its procession depart the vicinity of Plaza del Carmen as the Basilica’s bells are rung. The image of Our Lady is then returned to the high altar.&lt;ref name="Dungaw situationer report"&gt;{{cite web|last=Velasco|first=Ricky|title=radio news report|work=Doctor Love (radio show)|publisher=DZMM 630|accessdate=January 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theologically, the ''Dungaw'' rite reflects the fourth [[Stations of the Cross#Traditional form|Traditional Station of the Cross]], where Christ meets his mother, the [[Veneration of Mary in Roman Catholicism|Virgin Mary]], en route to Golgotha.

=== Papal approval ===
[[Pope Innocent X]] approved veneration of the image in 1650 as a [[Sacramentals|sacramental]], and authorised the establishment of the Confraternity of the Most Holy Jesus Nazarene (Spanish: ''Cofradía de Nuestro Santo Jesús Nazareno'').&lt;ref&gt;Michael M. Ramos (2015), [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chinelo_Igwenagu2/publication/304989954_ENTREPRENEURSHIP_AN_ADVOCACY_FOR_BALANCING_GENDER_INEQUALITY/links/577e409308aed39f59945edf.pdf#page=229 POPULAR RELIGIOSITY: A FILIPINO EXPERIENCE OF AN INCULTURATED FAITH], Canadian International Journal of Social Science and Education, Volume 7, page 246; Quote: "This confraternity of the Nazarene was officially authorized by the bull of Pope Innocent X expedited in Rome on April 20, 1650, “By which the confraternity of N.P. Jesus Nazareno was erected and founded in the Church of the Agustinos Recoletos Descalzos in the city of Manila, and by virtue of which many graces and indulgences were granted to the members”.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonardo Mercado|title=Jesus Christ and the Gentile Mission|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IvmTFi9TQNYC&amp;pg=PA320|year=2002|publisher=Gregorian Biblical BookShop|isbn=978-88-7652-944-3|pages=320–321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a majority of the [[History of the Philippines (1521-1898)|Spanish Era]], Filipinos were barred from taking [[Holy Orders]], while [[confraternity|confraternities]] were groups of religious [[laity|laymen]] and thus an open option. [[Pope Pius VII]] gave the image his [[Apostolic Blessing]] in 1880, which granted [[plenary indulgence]] to those who piously pray before it.

==Devotions==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
[[File:Black Nazarene procession.jpg|300px|thumb|A replica&lt;!-- This is a replica, because it is clearly not on the ''Ándas''. --&gt; of the Black Nazarene at [[Plaza Miranda]] during the 2011 ''Traslación''.]]
Religious veneration of the Black Nazarene is rooted among [[Filipinos]] who identify themselves with the [[Passion of Jesus|passion and suffering]] of Christ which the image depicts. Many devotees of the Black Nazarene relate their poverty and daily struggles to the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion of Christ]] as represented by the image.

While the actual [[patron saint]] of the basilica is [[John the Baptist]] (making its feast day 24 June, concurrent with [[Public holidays in the Philippines#Local observance|Manila Day]]), the Black Nazarene and its ''Traslación'' are more popular. At the end of each [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] offered in the Minor Basilica, devotees pay homage to the image by clapping their hands. In addition to the novena, ''Traslación'', ''Pahalík'', and the ''Pabihis'', the ''Pasindí'' ("lighting") or lighting of votive candles is another popular devotion, as is the decades-old, reverential custom of creeping on one's knees up the main [[aisle]] towards the image.
 
The Friday of each week in the year (except Good Friday, the image's liturgical commemoration) is colloquially known in Metro Manila as "Quiapo Day", since the novena in the image's honour is held on this day nationwide. As with Wednesday (which is comparably called "[[National Shrine of Our Mother of Perpetual Help|Baclaran Day]]"), this day is associated with heavy traffic surrounding the vicinity due to the influx of devotees.

The [[Nazarene Catholic School]] (formerly known as the [[Quiapo Parochial School]]) reflects the devotion of decision-makers of the school to the Black Nazarene. The school's official newsletter is likewise named "The Nazarene" with the pupils attributed as being "Nazareneans."

The largest procession in reverence for the Black Nazarene image is the January 9 ''Traslación'' procession every year, attracting millions of Catholic devotees, who throng to touch or get their towel touched by the image carriers and the image and thereby get a blessing from the image.&lt;ref name=twigg16/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tremlett2008p1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joi Barrios|title=Intermediate Tagalog|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F71GCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA183 |year=2015|publisher=Singapore: Tuttle|isbn=978-1-4629-1427-2|pages=182–184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the procession, every Friday, the image of the Black Nazarene is venerated by Filipino devotees. It is, along with [[Santo Niño de Cebú|Santo Niño]] (Child Jesus), is the most popular object of devotion in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="Wainwright2006p674"/&gt; In 2011, over six million Catholic devotees flocked to the Black Nazarene procession.&lt;ref&gt;Jose Alain Austria (2012), [http://www.ejournals.ph/article.php?id=3177 Hijos de Enero 9: Quiapo’s Black Nazarene Procession as a Male Rite of Passage], ''Manila Journal'', Volume 8, Number 1, page 15; Quote: "This year [2011] approximately 6.5 million devotees flocked to Quiapo and the Luneta, joining the longest procession on record of sixteen hours. (...) What seems to be pure mayhem in the eyes of the on-looker, or pure faith on the part of the religious, is also a complex of herculean tasks that the young male devotee must perform not only to gain graces, but also to earn the approval of both his peers, the elder male devotees, and most importantly the Nuestro Padre Jesus Nazareno.".&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hymn ===
The hymn ''Nuestro Padre Jesús Nazareno'' was composed by [[Lucio San Pedro]] to honour the image. It is used by the Minor Basilica as the official anthem of the devotion and its associated rites.

=== Outside Quiapo ===
Similar processions replicating the ''Traslación'' are also held on 9 January in other parts of the country. The largest of these is held in [[Cagayan de Oro City]], which uses an official replica of the image given by the Minor Basilica in 2009.

[[Filipino diaspora|Filipinos overseas]] have brought the tradition of a procession and Mass honouring of the Black Nazarene image to countries such as [[Australia]] and the [[United States]]. As in Quiapo, a copy of the image is paraded through the streets or within the parish bounds, with devotees reciting prayers in its wake.

In September 2012, a replica of the Black Nazarene was canonically enshrined at Saint Catherine of Siena Roman Catholic Parish in [[Reseda, California]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://perpetualhelp.weebly.com/black-nazarene.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, 2014, a replica of the Black Nazarene from Quiapo Church arrived at the Old Chapel of St. Rock the Healer Mission Center, Bishop's Compound, Brgy. Cawayan, [[Catarman, Northern Samar]]. Since then, many devotees across [[Northern Samar]] came to venerate the sacred image, especially during Fridays. At that time, the said mission center were constructing a bigger church.

On January 9, 2015, the first ''Traslación'' was held, in solidarity with the Quiapo Church. It was when the sacred image was transferred from the old church to the new and unfinished church building. Crowds not only from [[Northern Samar]] but all over the island attended.&lt;ref&gt;http://sundayex.catholic.org.hk/node/3551&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 12, 2016, the newly constructed church was blessed, dedicated and consecrated by His Eminence Luis Antonio Cardinal Tagle. The event was concelebrated by the priests from Quiapo Church, Felomino G. Bactol (Bishop of Naval), Bishop Emeritus Anghel Hobayan (the first bishop of the Diocese of Catarman), Bishop Emmanuel C. Trance (present Bishop of Catarman), Mission Center's first administrator Rev. Fr. Alan Abalon and Mission Center's second administrator and rector Rev. Fr. Rico M. Manook. The event was attended by many religious people from different dioceses in Eastern Visayas. Also, during this event, the St. Rock the Healer Mission Center was elevated as the Diocesan Shrine of Nuestro Padre Jesus Nazareno, making it the first church in the Visayas to be declared a shrine in honor of this image.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbcpnews.com/cbcpnews/?p=84183&lt;/ref&gt;

===Idolatry controversy===
According to Jaime Laya, the devotional worship of Black Nazarene of Quiapo is idolatry, but he states it may be a continuation of possibly pre-Christian local ritual practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jaime C. Laya|title=Letras Y Figuras |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fbplAAAAMAAJ |year=2001|publisher=Manila: Anvil|isbn=978-971-27-1143-5|pages=89–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Pisares also states that this is idolatry, and suggests its link with the social disparities among the Filipino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth H. Pisares|title=Daly City is My Nation: Race, Imperialism and the Claiming of Pinay / Pinoy Identities in Filipino American Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mRVNAQAAMAAJ |year=1999|publisher=University of California Press|page=58|oclc= 43832108}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, according to the rector Monsignor of Quiapo, Jose Clemente Ignacio, the procession and devotion is not idolatry, rather it is a reflection of "Filipino trait to want to wipe, touch, kiss, or embrace sacred objects if possible", and it is just a belief in "the presence of the Divine in sacred objects and places".&lt;ref&gt;Jazmin Badong Llana (2014), [http://www.dlsu.edu.ph/conferences/dlsu_research_congress/2014/_pdf/proceedings/TPHS-I-005-FT.pdf Inaesthetics of Performance in the Black Nazarene Procession], De La Salle University, DLSU Research Congress 2014, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mariano Barbato, the debate over the icon is centred on the questions of what constitutes idolatry, when an icon becomes a false god, and what makes the procession ritual idolatrous.&lt;ref name="Barbato2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barbato| first1=Mariano|title=Self: Pilgrim, Nomad, Homo Faber| year=2013 |pages=55–82| isbn =978-1-137-27581-3| doi=10.1057/9781137275813_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
Travel within the City of Manila during the ''Traslación'' every January 9 might be difficult as heavy traffic is expected. Most [[jeepney]]s use alternate routes for the day to avoid the procession, thus creating additional travel time. Some public transport systems such as the [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1|LRT-1]], [[Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 2|LRT-2]], and [[Manila Metro Rail Transit System Line 3|MRT-3]] provide free rides to devotees, who are easily identifiable as dressed in maroon and walking barefoot.

Traffic rerouting is implemented on the annual procession and the day before, and is enforced by the [[Manila Police District]] with reinforcements from the [[Philippine National Police]] and, since 2014, the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] and the [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]]. The [[Philippine Coast Guard]] guards stretches of the Pasig River along the [[Jones Bridge|Jones]] (since 2014), [[Quezon Bridge|Quezon]] and [[MacArthur Bridge (Manila)|MacArthur]] (until 2014) bridges to ensure the safe passage of the procession.

A similar scenario may be experienced by tourists and travellers in Cagayan de Oro and in Catarman, Northern Samar during the yearly processions of the sacred image, as well as in other towns and cities where replica images are brought out in procession on this day.

[[File:Black metal bookend.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A simple sheetmetal bookend]]

Common in [[libraries]], bookstores, and homes, the '''bookend''' is an object tall, sturdy, and heavy enough, when placed at either end of a row of upright [[book]]s, to support or [[buttress]] them.   Heavy bookends—made of [[wood]], [[bronze]], [[marble]], and even large [[geode]]s—have been used for centuries; the simple sheetmetal bookend  (originally patented in 1877 by William Stebbins Barnard)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Patent US186974|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US186974}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses the weight of the books standing on its foot to clamp the bookend's tall brace against the last book's back; in libraries, simple metal brackets are often used to support the end of a row of books. Elaborate and decorative bookends are not uncommon as elements in [[home decor]].

The '''Bureau of Silly Ideas Lbg''' (BOSI) is a not-for-profit [[conceptual art]] organisation that produces shows and interactive installations; operating predominantly in public spaces. Initially founded in October 2002 by Roger Hartley and Claire Horan, registered&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/04556803|title=BUREAU OF SILLY IDEAS LIMITED - Overview (free company information from Companies House)|website=beta.companieshouse.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Companies House]]'''.''' In 2016 they further expanded to become a [[Community interest company|CIC Trust Organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10059715|title=BUREAU OF SILLY IDEAS TRUST COMMUNITY INTEREST COMPANY - Overview (free company information from Companies House)|website=beta.companieshouse.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of Silly Ideas is funded by [[Arts Council England]] and headquartered in [[Brixton]], London.

The majority of their work is in collaboration with local government councils across the United Kingdom, in addition to commissions from a variety of heritage sites and festivals across the world. They are also members of National Association of Street Artists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nasauk.org/list-of-members/|title=List of Members|work=NASA UK|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Independent Street Arts Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.isanuk.org/profile/bureau-of-silly-ideas/|title=ISAN {{!}} Bureau Of Silly Ideas|website=www.isanuk.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the first company to combine circus performance under the veil of construction work - transforming everyday objects into unassuming props or using radio controlled robotics.

== History ==

=== Early Conception ===

The Bureau of Silly Ideas was founded in October 2002 by Roger Hartley, an artist who was predominantly interested in performance in public spaces. He was interested by the fictitious transformation of everyday objects and what he saw, as their ability to unequivocally connect with individuals. This was inspired by a show in 1997 that Roger began to work on with Simon Collins to create a show based on Don Quixote with life size fire breathing robot horses and radio controlled wheelie bins. Roger had early experience in transforming spaces as he invented and launched ‘Lost Vagueness’ a pop up working casino and Cabaret with strict dress code that would appear in places not used to dress code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://miraculoustheatre.com/performers-with-miraculous-theatre-company|title=the company - Miraculous Theatre Company|work=Miraculous Theatre Company|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger and BOSI continue to infiltrate festivals but with interactive art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bureau of Silly ideas|title=Barry The Portalloo @ Glastonbury 2011|date=2011-07-01|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i21LNIGhhdY|accessdate=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger was approached by Arts Council England to present ideas for street circus, theater and carnival; which has recently been accepted as forms of Art by the council. His proposition was performances that juxtaposed circus and funfair against construction sites and roadworks, which involved transforming these everyday objects and activities. His purpose was to engage people with their communities development in a fun and memorable way, in order to change their perception of something they may have otherwise found frustrating.

Roger received funding from Arts Council England and created the Bureau of Silly Ideas and the company's first show ‘The Hole Job’.

=== Development Years ===

In 2008 The Bureau of Silly Ideas produced a show called ‘Big Oriental Squid Inc’ (BOSI) which was also an officially registered subsidiary company. The styling of performance names using the same acronym ‘BOSI’ has become a hallmark of their work. This show demonstrated an important artistic shift from concentrating on everyday objects to everyday companies. Pushing and exploring legal boundaries and exploring the public's reaction to fictitious but official companies. They were the first to use a cross-media approach for the narrative of a public art event, 2008 – Burst Pipe Dream in Brighton. Utilizing social media, fake news and company Big Oriental Squid Inc to provoke public backlash before unveiling the entire show as fictitious and for fun and then engaged them in the final performance. Subtly hitting multiple politically fused subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bureau of Silly ideas|title=Bureau Of Silly Ideas_The Burst Pipe Dream|date=2010-05-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJs5WFj-Lxo|accessdate=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== At Present ===

In 2016 Roger Hartley and BOSI worked as first resident artist for [[Shakespeare Birthplace Trust]]. Which culminated in the creation of the United Nations Board of Significant Inspiration (UNBOSI) and the ‘Garden of Curious Amusement’ in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.visitstratforduponavon.co.uk/event/birthplace-trust-garden-of-curious-a-muse-ments|title=BIRTHPLACE TRUST//Garden of Curious A-MUSE-ments|website=www.visitstratforduponavon.co.uk|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"BOSI were an inspirational partner to work with, engaging in a really constructive dialogue with the SBT on exciting and unique project ideas, and then delivering a successful activity that met with excellent customer feedback from audience members who were both surprised and delighted with their experience.” Dr Delia Garratt (Director of Cultural Engagement SBT)&lt;/blockquote&gt;The UNBOSI project is continuing and has recently partnered with CPP Marketplace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cppmarketplace.co.uk/n-h-home/market-place-pleased-announce-new-partnership-un-bosi/|title=Market Place is pleased to announce new partnership with the UN BOSI - Market Place - The Place to Be|date=2018-04-09|work=Market Place - The Place to Be|access-date=2018-04-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; to conduct shows across the East Anglia area of the UK.

== Philosophy ==
The Bureau of Silly Ideas was founded in 2002 by Roger Hartley, who wanted to address the issue of fracturing communities within an increasingly connected and globalized world. The fundamental belief of the company is that the creation of, and access to, art is a pathway out of urban poverty traps. The method of exacting this belief was through Conceptual and Process Art performances; that transposed the 'everyday' into surprising and immersive experiences "taking a magnifier to [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]] urinal and extrapolating its essence, to a much greater scale" - Roger Hartley. The aim was to combat the loss of community involvement by creating shows that stripped back community development, such as construction and attempt to change the perception of them from interference to interactive; therefore bonding a community more closely with its refurbishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=TEDx Talks|title=Roger Hartley at TEDxLondon - City 2.0|date=2014-01-02|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ichtrU7UCOM|accessdate=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shows ==

=== The Burst Pipe Dream ===
The Burst Pipe Dream was a 7-day installation that took place in 2008 at Brighton's Jubilee Square, under the guise of a subsidiary company called 'Big Oriental Squid Inc'. The purpose of the event is described by BOSI as&lt;blockquote&gt;The story that [[Brighton]] would be welcoming Europe’s first Giant Squid Farm in newly developed, Jubilee Square. Created with two core aims in mind, the primary being community cohesion - the building of Jubilee Square had overrun and as such caused a discourse in the relationship between construction, public space and community. The second was to respond to the overfishing of our oceans by highlighting the role of corporations, who put profit before the planet. Since its' conception in 2008, BOSinc has visited various towns. The Burst Pipe Dream is currently being redeveloped for a national seaside town tour in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bureauofsillyideas.com/the-big-work/|title=The Big Work – Bureau of Silly Ideas|website=www.bureauofsillyideas.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Bureau of Silly Ideas collaborated with Brighton Festival for the event. The event attracted attention from the general public and local news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Bureau of Silly ideas|title=Bureau Of Silly Ideas_The Burst Pipe Dream|date=2010-05-06|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJs5WFj-Lxo|accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6959">'''Carolyn Korsmeyer''' (born 1950) is an author and Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Buffalo]] in New York. She is generally recognized for her study and research on [[aesthetics]], [[feminism]], and [[emotion theory]].&lt;ref name="Dept of Philosophy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carolyn Korsmeyer|url=http://www.philosophy.buffalo.edu/people/faculty/korsmeyer/|accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Carolyn received her Ph.D. from [[Brown University]] in 1972. In 1978, she began working as a professor of [[Philosophy]] at the University of Buffalo where she continues to work today as the Head of the Philosophy Department.&lt;ref name="University Archives"&gt;{{cite web|title=Carolyn Korsmeyer|url=http://library.buffalo.edu/archives/womens_work/bios/korsmeyer.htm|work=2012|publisher=University of Buffalo|accessdate=21 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305010343/http://library.buffalo.edu/archives/womens_work/bios/korsmeyer.htm#|archive-date=2014-03-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since beginning her career at the University of Buffalo, Korsmeyer has been recognized multiple times for her outstanding performance and continued achievements for her work both in and away from Philosophy.&lt;ref name="University Archives"/&gt; During her long career, Korsmeyer has published multiple acclaimed articles and books on feminism and aesthetics.&lt;ref name="University Archives"/&gt;

== Overview of major work ==
After receiving her PhD in 1972, Korsmeyer began to focus her research on feminist philosophy and the field of aesthetics. Feminist perspectives in aesthetics has long been major work of Korsmeyer.&lt;ref name="University Archives"/&gt;  Fine art, genius, beauty, taste, and  aesthetic perception are gendered issues that she has studied and researched.&lt;ref name="essay review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Koopman|first=Constantijn|title=Essay review of Gender and Aesthetics: An Introduction|url=http://act.maydaygroup.org/articles/Koopman5_1.pdf|publisher=Action, Criticism, and Theory for Music Education|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophy of taste ===
The [[philosophy of taste]] is a relatively new subject in the field of philosophy, however Korsmeyer's study of "bad taste" is well known.&lt;ref name="Dept of Philosophy"/&gt; Her consideration of taste in philosophy explores why pungent food like soured milk, fried bugs, extremely hot peppers, and game meat are seen as strong and complex to our palettes.&lt;ref name="Korsmeyer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Korsmeyer|first=Carolyn|title=Making Sense of Food and Taste: Food and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=20ltkqE2s1UC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP13&amp;dq=Carolyn+Korsmeyer&amp;ots=m8VqoRzxQR&amp;sig=jcuJ1Zd9LaQBy02TxjJrJm90Agc#v=onepage&amp;q=Carolyn%20Korsmeyer&amp;f=false|publisher=Cornell University Press|accessdate=25 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A theoretical understanding of taste of food is compared to the philosophy and interpretation of art in that both deem the similar qualities that entail discriminating perception and also that food and art are both considered 'artistic in creation.' &lt;ref name="Korsmeyer"/&gt;  The argument Korsmeyer presents is that these "cosmopolitan foods" are so complex that they lie on a nearly transparent line straddling between the sublime and disgusting and, when the brain is given the choice, usually the positive reaction wins. Thus, these seemingly disgusting foods give a positive aesthetic response.&lt;ref name="essay review"/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
Her publications on the subject include:&lt;ref name="acsu.buffalo.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~ckors/|title=Carolyn Korsmeyer|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist perspectives in aesthetics ===
[[Feminist aesthetics]] refers to the idea that in their basic form, classic concepts such as genius, beauty, fine art, aesthetic perception cradle social roles are qualities that are presumed as gender related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Korsmeyer|first=Carolyn|title=Feminist Aesthetics|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/encyclopedia/archinfo.cgi?entry=feminism-aesthetics|publisher=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition)|accessdate=20 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her most notorious book titled ''Gender and Aesthetics: An Introduction to Understanding Feminist Philosophy'' (London: Routledge, 2004) Korsmeyer uses these "classic concepts" to identify their qualities and goes on to explain the weight of gender as the abiding attribute. Genius, for example, is said to be 'superior in mind' which has long been associated with [[masculinity]] while '[[beauty]]' has long been described as small, soft curvatures that "catch a man's eye" and thus, is defined as female.&lt;ref name="essay review"/&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Much of her work revolves around the parameters of feminist presence in art, music, and literature.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|last=Korsmeyer|first=Carolyn|title=Aesthetics in Feminist Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=s6GSMUGGEmgC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=Carolyn+Korsmeyer&amp;ots=PuYT_sCHvT&amp;sig=MkrfyPnLMAJZFB6YSDop1CGKx00#v=onepage&amp;q=Carolyn%20Korsmeyer&amp;f=false|publisher=Hypatia, Inc|accessdate=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In her book ''Aesthetics in Feminist Perspective'' Korsemeyer compares theories of art and the varying interpretations based on gender bias.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

== Honors and achievements ==
University at Buffalo Research Recognition Program awarded Korsmeyer their Sustained Achievement Exceptional Scholar Award to awknowledge her outstanding performance over a several year period in her body of work.&lt;ref name="University Archives"/&gt; In 2001, she won the Buffalo and Erie County Public Library's Mark Twain Creative Writing Competition by writing a chapter that concluded Twain's unpublished short story, ''A Murder, a Mystery and a Marriage.''&lt;ref name="University Archives"/&gt;

[[File:CLUNY-Coffret Christ 1.JPG|thumb|Christ in majesty in a [[mandorla]], surrounded by emblems of the evangelists: ivory plaques on a wooden coffret, Cologne, first half of the 13th century ([[Musée de Cluny]])]]
'''Christ in Majesty''' or '''Christ in Glory''' ({{lang-la|Maiestas Domini}})&lt;ref&gt;The lexically similar ''[[Maestà]]'', Italian for "majesty", conventionally designates an iconic formula of the enthroned Madonna with the child Jesus.&lt;/ref&gt; is the Christian image of [[Christ]] seated on a throne as ruler of the world, always seen frontally in the centre of the composition, and often flanked by other sacred figures, whose membership changes over time and according to the context. The image develops from [[Early Christian art]], which directly borrowed the formulae of depictions of the enthroned [[Roman Emperor]].  In the [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] world, the image developed slightly differently into the half-length [[Christ Pantocrator]], "Christ, Ruler of All", a usually unaccompanied figure, and the [[Deesis]], where a full-length enthroned Christ is entreated by [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[St. John the Baptist]], and often other figures.  In the West, the evolving composition remains very consistent within each period until the [[Renaissance]], and then remains important until the end of the [[Baroque]], in which the image is ordinarily transported to the sky.

==Development==
[[File:1398 - Milano - S. Lorenzo - Cappella S. Aquilino - Traditio Legis - Dall'Orto - 18-May-2007.jpg|thumb|300px|''Traditio legis'', or "transmission of the law," Christ as lawgiver,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/traditio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623002048/http://www.aug.edu/augusta/iconography/traditio.html |archivedate=2013-06-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[mosaic]], [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Milan]], 4th century, includes a scroll box at Christ's feet.]]
From the latter part of the fourth century, a still beardless Christ begins to be depicted seated on a throne on a [[dais]], often with his feet on a low stool and usually flanked by Saints [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], and in a larger composition the other [[Twelve apostles|apostles]].  The central group of the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]] of 359 ([[Vatican Museums|Vatican]]) is the earliest example with a clear date.  In some cases Christ hands a [[scroll]] to St Peter on his right, imitating a gesture often made by Emperors handing an Imperial decree or letter of appointment to an official, as in ivory consular [[diptych]]s, on the [[Arch of Constantine]], and the [[Missorium of Theodosius I]].  This depiction is known as the '''''Traditio legis''''' ("handing over the law"), or ''Christ the lawgiver'' - "the apostles are indeed officials, to whom the whole world is entrusted" wrote Saint [[John Chrysostom]].&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Syndicus; ''Early Christian Art''; p. 96; Burns &amp; Oates, London, 1962. Hall pp. 78-80&lt;/ref&gt;  This depiction tends to merge into one of "Christ the teacher", which also derives from classical images of bearded philosophers.

Other Imperial depictions of Christ, standing as a triumphing general, or seated on a ball representing the world, or with different companions, are found in the next centuries. By the seventh century the Byzantine Christ Pantocrator holding a book representing the [[Gospel]]s and raising his right hand has become essentially fixed in the form it retains in [[Eastern Orthodoxy]] today.&lt;ref&gt;James Hall, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'', pp. 92-3, 1983, John Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-7195-3971-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Christ Triumphant" had a separate future development, usually standing, often with both hands raised high.
[[File:Deesis Hagia Sophia.jpg|thumb|left|The Deesis mosaic in the [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople]]
The Pantocrator figure first became half-length because large versions filled the semi-dome of the [[apse]] of many, if not most, decorated churches. A full-length figure would need to be greatly reduced for the head to make maximum impact from a distance (because of the flattening at the top of the semi-dome).  The gesture Christ makes has become one of blessing, but is originally an [[orator]]s gesture of his right to speak.&lt;ref&gt;Christ in early examples is Christ the Teacher: the gesture of Christ's right hand is not the gesture of blessing, but the orator's gesture; the identical gesture is to be seen in a panel from an ivory [[diptych]] of an enthroned vice-prefect ''([[vicarius]])'', a [[Rufius Probianus]], ca 400, of which Peter Brown remarks, "With his hand he makes the 'orator's gesture' which indicates that he is speaking, or that he has the right to speak." Staatsbibliothek Berlin. Illustrated in Peter Brown, "Church and leadership" in Paul Veyne, editor, ''A History of Private Life: From Pagan Rome to Byzantium'' 1987, p 272.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Deesis'' became standard at the centre of the [[templon]] beam in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] churches and the templon's successor, the [[iconostasis]], and is also found as a panel [[icon]]. Generally the Pantocrator has no visible throne, but the earlier Deesis does, and at least a single-step dais.  The Deesis continues to appear in Western art, but not as often or in such an invariable composition as in the East.
[[File:Codex Bruchsal 1 01v cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Romanesque [[illuminated manuscript]] [[Gospel Book]], c.1220]]
In the West the image showed a full-length enthroned Christ, often in a [[mandorla]] or other geometrical frame, surrounded by the symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]], representing the vision of Chapters 4 and 5 of the [[Book of Revelation]].  In the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] period the twenty-four [[Elder (Christianity)|elder]]s of the [[Book of Revelation|Apocalypse]] are often seen. Christ also holds a book and makes the blessing gesture, no doubt under Byzantine influence. In both, Christ's head is surrounded by a crossed [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]. In Early Medieval Western art the image was very often given a full page in [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[Gospel Book]]s, and in metalwork or ivory on their covers, and it remained very common as a large-scale fresco in the semi-dome of the apse in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] churches, and carved in the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of church portals. This "seems to have been almost the only theme of [[apse]]-pictures" in [[Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian]] churches, all of which are now lost, although many examples from the period survive in [[illuminated manuscript]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus:143&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Romanesque period, the image in the West often began to revert to the earliest, more crowded conception, and [[archangel]]s, apostles and saints, now often all facing inwards towards Christ, appear, as well as the beasts emblematic of the Evangelists and the twenty-four elders.  This development paralleled the movement towards a more "realistic" depiction of the "heavenly court" seen in the increasingly popular subjects of the [[Maestà]] (the enthroned Virgin and Child) and the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] by Christ.

A Christ in Majesty became standard carved in the tympanum of a decorated [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] church portal, by now surrounded by a large number of much smaller figures around the [[archivolt]]s.  In painting, the [[Ghent Altarpiece]] is the culmination of the Gothic image, although a minority of [[art historian]]s believe that in this case it is [[God the Father]], not Christ, who is shown in majesty.

==Christ in Judgement==
[[File:Florentinischer Meister um 1300 001.jpg|thumb|280px|Florentine [[mosaic]] [[Last Judgement]] of about 1300]]
A variant figure, or the same figure in a different context, of Christ as Judge, became common in [[Last Judgement]]s, often painted on the west (rear) wall of churches.  Here an enthroned Christ, from the 13th century usually with robes pulled aside above the waist to reveal the wounds of the Passion (a motif taken from images of the [[Doubting Thomas]]&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, Vol 2, 188-189, 202&lt;/ref&gt;) sits high in a complex composition, with sinners being dragged down by devils to [[Hell]] on the right and the righteous on the left (at Christ's right-hand side) rising up to [[Heaven]].  Generally Christ still looks straight forward at the viewer, but has no book; he often gestures with his hands to direct the damned downwards, and the saved up.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Mâle, ''The Gothic Image: Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century'', p 365-76, English trans of 3rd edn, 1913, Collins, London (and many other editions)&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[High Renaissance]] the subject was more loosely treated; Christ and his court take to the clouds, and are distributed with an eye to a harmonious and "natural" composition rather than the serried ranks of old.  From the late Renaissance and through the Baroque, it often forms the upper part of a picture depicting events on earth in the lower register, and as stricter perspective replaces the hieratic scaling of the Middle Ages, Christ becomes literally diminished.  Such depictions tend not to be described as "Christ in Majesty", although they are the linear development of the earlier image; the main subject has become the human events in the foreground, such as the martyrdom of a saint, to which Christ is now a rather distant witness.

'''Cordel literature '''(from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] term, ''literatura de cordel'', literally “string literature”) are popular and inexpensively printed booklets or [[pamphlets]] containing [[folklore|folk]] [[novels]], [[poems]] and [[songs]]. They are produced and sold in street markets and by street vendors in [[Brazil]], principally in the [[Northeast of Brazil|Northeast]]. They are so named because they are hung from strings to display them to potential customers.

== History ==
Cordel literature forms one of the least altered continuations of the Western traditions of popular literature, such as [[chapbook]]s, and [[popular prints]]. They come from the ''[[papel volante]]'' tradition of [[Portugal]]. This genre of literature was also found in Spain during the 18th and 19th centuries, and offered readers a wide array of topics, from basic instruction to political tracts.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

According to the poet [[Carlos Drummond de Andrade]] it is one of the purest manifestations of the inventive spirit, the sense of humor and the critical capacity of Brazilians from the interior and of the humblest backgrounds.&lt;ref name=Slater&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slater|first1=Candace |authorlink=Candace Slater |title=A vida no barbante: a literatura de cordel no Brasil|date=1984|publisher=Civilização Brasileira|location=Rio de Janeiro|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Form ==
[[File:Xilogravura de Yolanda Carvalho.JPG|thumb|right|Woodcut by Yolanda Carvalho]]
Usually produced in black and white, in [[quarto]] format, ''cordel'' chapbooks are usually illustrated with [[woodcut]]s. Often both the author or poet’s and the woodcut artist’s names will appear in the credits of the book. Two expressive woodcutters are Adir Botelho and José Francisco Borges, whose woodcuts have been exhibited in the [[Louvre]] and the [[Smithsonian]].

The cordel literature found its zenith in the decades of 20s and 30s, with the popular legend created by the [[cangaço|cangaceiros]] of [[Lampião]], a band of outlaws and bandolier bandits who terrorized the region for almost 20 years. The [[War of Canudos]], a military conflict in the state of [[Bahia]], 1896-1897, has been also a frequent theme of cordel literature, due to its epic dimensions and importance for the history of the [[Sertão|Northeast backlands]].

Cordel literature can still be found in the Northeastern Brazilian states, most notably in [[Pernambuco]], [[Paraíba]] and [[Ceará]].

== Authors ==
Some of the main authors from the past are Leandro Gomes de Barros (1865-1918)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recantodasletras.com.br/artigos/976198|title=A literatura de cordel e Leandro Gomes De Barros: Vida e obra|work=Recanto das Letras|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and João Martins de Athayde (1880-1959). 

Today some Cordel Literature authors as Marcelo Soares, [[Davi Teixeira]], Meca Moreco and Altair Leal are keeping this popular expression alive. They and others are helping to show to Brazil and the world the importance of popular art.

There are a lot of not-well-known cordel authors in Brazil, although there are still chapbooks that tell widely known old tales, even reivented, in a new context. See as an example a masterpiece of the past decades: ''A Chegada de Lampião no Inferno'' (The Arrival of Lampião in Hell) by José Pacheco, as well as today's ''A Chegada de Lula no Inferno'' (The Arrival of Lula in Hell); besides "classics", living folk poetry say to us much both about cordel and its strong roots in the day-to-day life of the people and its place in the Brazilian Culture as a whole.

Strictly, '''digital theatre''' is a hybrid art form, gaining strength from [[theatre]]’s ability to facilitate the imagination and create human connections and [[Digital data|digital]] technology’s ability to extend the reach of communication and visualization. (However, the phrase is also used in a more generic sense by companies such as [[Evans and Sutherland]] to refer to their [[fulldome]] projection technology products.)

==Description== 
Digital theatre is primarily identified by the coexistence of “live” performers and digital [[Electronic media|media]] in the same unbroken(1) space with a co-present audience. In addition to the necessity that its performance must be simultaneously “live” and digital, the event’s secondary characteristics are that its content should retain some recognizable theatre roles (through limiting the level of [[interactivity]]) and a narrative element of spoken language or text. The four conditions of digital theatre are:

#It is a “live” performance placing at least some performers in the same shared physical space with an audience.(2)
#The performance must use digital technology as an essential part of the primary artistic event.(3)
#The performance contains only limited levels of [[interactivity]],(4) in that its content is shaped primarily by the artist(s) for an audience.(5)
#The performance’s content should contain either spoken language or text which might constitute a [[narrative]] or story, differentiating it from other events which are distinctly [[dance]], [[art]], or [[music]].

==”Live,” digital media, interactivity, and narrative==
A brief clarification of these terms in relation to digital theatre is in order. The significance of the terms “live” or “liveness” as they occur in [[theatre]] can not be over-emphasized, as it is set in opposition to [[Digital data|digital]] in order to indicate the presence of both types of communication, human and computer-created. Rather than considering the real-time or temporality of events, digital theatre concerns the interactions of people (audience and actors) sharing the same physical space (in at least one location, if multiple audiences exist). In the case of mass broadcast, it is essential that this sharing of public space occurs at the site of the primary artistic event.(6) The next necessary condition for creating digital theatre is the presence of digital media in the performance. [[Digital media]] is not defined through the presence of one type of technology hardware or software configuration, but by its characteristics of being flexible, mutable, easily adapted, and able to be processed in real-time. It is the ability to change not only sound and light, but also images, [[video]], [[animation]], and other content into triggered, manipulated, and reconstituted data which is relayed or transmitted in relation to other impulses which defines the essential nature of the digital format.  Digital information has the quality of pure computational potential, which can be seen as parallel to the potential of human imagination.

The remaining characteristics of limited interactivity and narrative or spoken word are secondary and less distinct parameters.  While [[interactivity]] can apply to both the interaction between humans and machines and between humans, digital theatre is primarily concerned with the levels of interactivity occurring between audience and performers (as it is facilitated through technology).(7)  It is in this type of interactivity, similar to other types of heightened audience participation,(8) that the roles of message sender and receiver can dissolve to that of equal conversers, causing theatre to dissipate into conversation.  The term “[[interactive]]” refers to any mutually or reciprocally active communication, whether it be a human-human or a human-machine communication.

The criteria of having [[narrative]] content through spoken language or text as part of the theatrical event is meant not to limit the range of what is already considered standard theatre (as there are examples in the works of [[Samuel Beckett]] in which the limits of verbal expression are tested), but to differentiate between that which is digital theatre and the currently more developed fields of digital dance9 and Art Technology.(10)  This is necessary because of the mutability between art forms utilizing technology.  It is also meant to suggest a wide range of works including dance theatre involving technology and spoken words such as [[Troika Ranch]]’s [[Chymical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz|The Chemical Wedding of Christian Rosenkreutz]] (Troika Ranch, 2000), to the creation of original text-based works online by performers like the Plain Text Players or collaborations such as Art Grid’s Interplay: Hallucinations, to pre-scripted works such as the classics (''[[A Midsummer Night’s Dream]]'', ''[[The Tempest]])'' staged with technology at the [[University of Kansas]] and the [[University of Georgia]].

The Participatory Virtual Theatre efforts at the Rochester Institute of Technology take a different approach by have live actors use motion capture to control avatars on a virtual stage.  Audience responses are designed into the software that supports the performance.  In the 2004 production, "What's the Buzz?" (17), a single node motion capture device controlled the performance of a swarm of bees. Later performances use two motion capture systems located in different buildings controlling the performance on a single virtual stage (18).

These criteria or limiting parameters are flexible enough to allow for a wide range of theatrical activities while refining the scope of events to those which most resemble the hybrid “live”/mediated form of theatre described as digital theatre.  digital theatre is separated from the larger category of digital performance (as expressed in the overabundance of a variety of items including installations, dance concerts, [[Compact disc]]s, robot fights and other events found in the Digital Performance Archive).

==History==
In the early 1980s, video, satellites, fax machines, and other communications equipment began to be used as methods of creating art and performance. The groups [[Fluxus]] and [[John Cage]] were among the early leaders in expanding what was considered art, technology, and performance.  With the adaptation of personal computers in the 1980s, new possibilities for creating performance communications was born.  Artists like Sherrie Rabinowitz and Kit Galloway began to transition from earlier, more costly experiments with satellite transmission to experiments with the developing internet.  Online communities such as [[WELL (virtual community)|The Well]] and [[interactive writing]] offered new models for artistic creativity.  With the ‘Dot Com’ boom of the 1990s, telematic artists including [[Roy Ascott]] began to develop greater significance as theatre groups like [[George Coates|George Coates Performance Works]] and Gertrude Stein Repertory Theatre established partnerships with software and hardware companies encouraged by the technology boom.In Australia in the early 1990s Julie Martin's Virtual Reality Theatre presented works at the Sydney Opera House, featuring the first hybrid human digital avatars, in 1996 "A Midsummer Nights Dream featured Augmented Reality Stage sets designed and produced by her company.  Researchers such as Claudio Pinanhez at [[MIT]], David Saltz of The Interactive Performance Laboratory at the University of Georgia, and Mark Reaney head of the Virtual Reality Theatre Lab at the [[University of Kansas]], as well as significant [[dance technology]] partnerships (including Riverbed and Riverbed’s work with [[Merce Cunningham]]) led to an unprecedented expansion in the use of digital technology in creating media-rich performances (including the use of [[motion capture]], 3D stereoscopic animation, and [[virtual reality]] as in The Virtual Theatricality Lab‘s production of ''The Skriker'' at [[Henry Ford Community College]] under the direction of Dr. George Popovich. Another example is the [http://www.stenslie.net/?page_id=69 sense:less] project by [[Stahl Stenslie|Stenslie]]/Mork/Watz/Pendry using virtual actors that users would engage with inside a VR environment. The project was shown at ELECTRA, Henie Onstad Art Center, Norway,  [http://www.v2.nl/archive/works/sense-less DEAF 1996] in Rotterdam and the Fifth Istanbul Biennial (1997).

Early use of mechanical and projection devices for theatrical entertainments have a long history tracing back to mechanicals of [[ancient Greece]] and medieval [[magic lantern]]s.  But the most significant precursors of digital theatre can be seen in the works of the early 20th century.  It is in the ideas of artists including [[Edward Gordon Craig]], [[Erwin Piscator]] (and to a limited degree [[Bertolt Brecht]] in their joint work on [[Epic Theatre]]), [[Josef Svoboda]], and the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Futurists]] movements that we can see the strongest connections between today’s use of digital media and live actors, and earlier, experimental theatrical use of non-human actors, broadcast technology, and filmic projections.

The presence of these theatrical progenitors using analog media, such as filmic projection, provides a bridge between [[Theatre]] and many of today’s vast array of computer-art-performance-communication experiments.  These past examples of theatre artists integrating their modern technology with theatre strengthens the argument that theatrical entertainment does not have to be either purist involving only “live” actors on stage, or be consumed by the dominant televisual [[mass media]], but can gain from the strengths of both types of communication.

==Other terminology==
Digital theatre does not exist in a vacuum but in relation to other terminology.  It is a type of [[Digital Performance]] and may accommodate many types of “live”/mediated theatre including “VR Theatre”(11) and “Computer Theatre,”(12) both of which involve specific types of computer media, “live” performers, story/words, and limited levels of interactivity.  However, terms such as “Desktop Theatre,”(13) using animated computer avatars in online chat-rooms without co-present audiences falls outside digital theatre into the larger category of digital performance.  Likewise, digital dance may fall outside the parameters of digital theatre, if it does not contain elements of story or spoken words.

"[[Cyberformance]]" can be included within this definition of Digital theatre, where it includes a proximal audience: "Cyberformance can be created and presented entirely online, for a distributed online audience who participate via internet-connected computers anywhere in the world, or it can be presented to a proximal audience (such as in a physical theatre or gallery venue) with some or all of the performers appearing via the internet; or it can be a hybrid of the two approaches, with both remote and proximal audiences and/or performers."

==Notes==

#Space not divided by visible solid interfaces such as walls, glass screens, or other visible barriers which perceptually divide the audience from the playing space making two (or more) rooms rather than a continuous place including both stage and audience.
#It is suggested that a minimal audience of two or more is needed to keep a performance from being a conversation or art piece.  If additional online or mediated audiences exist, only one site need have a co-present audience/performer situation.
#Digital technology may be used to create, manipulate or influence content. However, the use of technology for transmission or archiving does not constitute a performance of digital theatre.
#Interactivity is more than choices on a navigation menu, low levels of participation or getting a desired response to a request.  [[Sheizaf Rafaeli]] defines it as existing in the relay of a message, in which the third or subsequent message refers back to the first.   “Formally stated, interactivity is an expression of the extent that in a given series of communication exchanges, any third (or later) transmission (or message) is related to the degree to which previous exchanges referred to even earlier transmissions” (Sheizaf Rafaeli, “[https://www.academia.edu/download/44162252/Rafaeli_interactivity.pdf Interactivity, From New Media to Communication]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }},” pages 110-34 in ''Advanced Communicational Science:  Merging Mass and Interpersonal Processes'', ed. Robert P. Hawkins, John M. Wiemann, and Suzanne Pingree [Newbury Park:  Sage Publications, 1988] 111).
#Though some of the content may be formed or manipulated by both groups, the flow of information is primarily from message creator or sender to receiver, thus maintaining the roles of author/performer and audience (rather than dissolving those roles into equal participants in a conversation). This also excludes gaming or VR environments in which the (usually isolated) participant is the director of the action which his actions drive.
#While TV studio audiences may feel that they are at a public “live” performance, these performances are often edited and remixed for the benefit of their intended primary audience, the home audiences which are viewing the mass broadcast in private.  Broadcasts of “Great Performances” by PBS and other theatrical events broadcast into private homes, give the TV viewers the sense that they are secondary viewers of a primary “live” event.  In addition, archival or real-time web-casts which do not generate feedback influencing the “live” performances are not within the range of digital theatre.  In each case, a visible interface such as TV or monitor screen, like a camera frames and interprets the original event for the viewers.
#An example of this is the case of internet chat which becomes the main text of be read or physically interpreted by performers on stage.  Online input including content and directions can also have an effect of influencing “live” performance beyond the ability of “live” co-present audiences.
#E.g. [[happenings]].
#Such as the stunning visual media dance concerts like ''Ghostcatching'', by Merce Cunningham and Riverbed, accessible online via the revamped/migrated Digital Performance Archive ''[http://www.ahds.ac.uk/ahdscollections/docroot/dpa/authorsearch.do?string=D&amp;searchbox=merce]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}'' and ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20050323232028/http://merce.org/home.html Merce Cunningham Dance]''; cf. Isabel C. Valverde, “Catching Ghosts in ''Ghostcatching'':  Choreographing Gender and Race in Riverbed/Bill T. Jones’ Virtual Dance,” accessible in a pdf version from ''[https://web.archive.org/web/20051102005319/http://www.wac.ucla.edu/extensionsjournal/v2/pdf/valverde.pdf Extensions: The Online Journal of Embodied Teaching]''.
#Such as ''Telematic Dreaming'', by Paul Sermon, in which distant participants shared a bed through mixing projected video streams; see [http://www.hgb-leipzig.de/~sermon/dream/ "Telematic Dreaming - Statement."]
#Mark Reaney, head of the Virtual Reality Theatre Lab at the University of Kansas, investigates the use of virtual reality (“and related technologies”) in theatre.  “VR Theatre” is one form or subset of digital theatre focusing on utilizing virtual reality immersion in mutual concession with traditional theatre practices (actors, directors, plays, a theatre environment).  The group uses image projection and stereoscopic sets as their primary area of digital investigation.
#Another example of digital theatre is Computer Theatre, as defined by Claudio S. Pinhanez in his work '''Computer Theatre'' (in which he also gives the definition of “hyper-actor” as an actor whose expressive capabilities are extended through the use of technologies).  “Computer Theatre, in my view, is about providing means to enhance the artistic possibilities and experiences of professional and amateur actors, or of audiences clearly engaged in a representational role in a performance”  (''Computer Theater'' [Cambridge:  Perceptual Computing Group -- MIT Media Laboratory, 1996] (forthcoming in a revised ed.); Pinhanez also sees this technology being explored more through dance than theatre.  His writing and his productions of ''I/IT'' suggest that ''Computer Theatre'' is digital theatre.
#On the far end of the spectrum, outside of the parameters of digital theatre, are what are called Desktop Theater and Virtual Theatre.  These are digital performances or media events which are created and presented on computers utilizing intelligent agents or synthetic characters, called avatars.  Often these are interactive computer programs or online conversations.  Without human actors, or group audiences, these works are computer multimedia interfaces allowing a user to play at the roles of theatre rather than being theatre.  Virtual Theatre is defined by the Virtual Theatre Project at Stanford on their website as a project which “aims to provide a multimedia environment in which user can play all of the creative roles associated with producing and performing plays and stories in an improvisational theatre company.”
#For more information, see ''Multimedia:  From Wagner to Virtual Reality'', ed. Randall Packer and Ken Jordan; ''Telepresence and Bio Art'', by Eduardo Kac; and ''Virtual Theatres:  An Introduction'', by Gabriella Giannachi (London and New York: Routledge, 2004).
#Media, in this sense, indicates the broadcast and projection of film, video, images and other content which can, but need not be digitized.  These elements are often seen as additions to traditional forms of theatre even before the use of computers to process them.  The addition of computers to process visual, aural and other data allows for greater flexibility in translating visual and other information into impulses which can interact with each other and their environments in real-time.  Media is also distinguished from mass media, by which primarily means TV broadcast, Film, and other communications resources owned by multi-national media corporations.  Mass media is that section of the media specifically conceived and designed to reach a very large audience (typically at least as large as the majority of the population of a nation state).  It refers primarily to television, film, internet, and various news/entertainment corporations and their subsidiaries.
#Here the use of quotations signals a familiarity with the issues of mediation vs. real-time events as expressed by Phillip Auslander, yet choosing to use the term in its earlier meaning, indicating co-present human audience and actors in the same shared breathing space unrestrained by a physical barrier or perceived interface.  This earlier meaning is still in standard use by digital media performers to signify the simultaneous presence of the human and the technological other.  It is possible also to use the term (a)live to indicate co-presence.

The '''edition notice''' (or '''copyright page''') is the page in a [[book]] containing information about the current [[edition (books)|edition]], usually on the back of the title page.  It often contains a [[copyright notice]], legal notices, [[publication]] information, printing history, [[Cataloging in Publication|cataloguing information]] from a [[national library]], and an [[ISBN]] that uniquely identifies the work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editorialservice.com/faq_copyrightpage.html Editorialservice.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the bottom of the edition notice one often finds a line of numbers, some of which may appear to be missing, called the [[printer's key]].  These indicate the book's [[print run]].

Sometimes, there will also be a warning indicating that the book sold without a cover is a [[stripped book]].

[[File:Mowgli-1895-illustration.png|thumb|[[Mowgli]] was a fictional feral child in [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[The Jungle Book]]''.]]
A '''feral child''' (also called '''wild child''') is a [[human]] child who has lived isolated from human contact from a very young age, where they have little or no experience of human care, behavior or human [[language]]. There are several confirmed cases and other speculative ones. Feral children may have experienced severe [[Child abuse|abuse]] or [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] before being abandoned or running away. They are sometimes the subjects of [[folklore]] and [[legend]]s, typically portrayed as having been raised by animals.

==Description==
Feral children lack the basic [[social skills]] that are normally learned in the process of [[enculturation]]. For example, they may be unable to learn to use a [[toilet]], have trouble learning to walk upright after walking on fours all their lives, or display a complete lack of interest in the human activity around them. They often seem mentally impaired and have almost insurmountable trouble [[language acquisition|learning a human language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.zmescience.com/other/feature-post/feral-children/|title = Mind Blowing Cases of Children Raised by Animals|date = December 1, 2014|accessdate = February 20, 2015|website = ZME Science|publisher = |last = Mihai|first = Andrei}}&lt;/ref&gt; The impaired ability to learn a [[natural language]] after having been isolated for so many years is often attributed to the existence of a [[critical period]] for language learning, and taken as evidence in favor of the [[critical period hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="Birdsong1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Birdsong|title=Second Language Acquisition and the Critical Period Hypothesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d7OPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74&amp;focus=viewport&amp;q=curtiss%201977|year=1999|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-67489-2|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.475.3365&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf This is an illegal scan, not sure whether the link should be included here--&gt;&lt;ref name="Curtiss2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Susan Curtiss|title=Genie: A Psycholinguistic Study of a Modern-Day Wild Child|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pSy0BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;focus=viewport&amp;q=%22critical%20period%22|date=10 May 2014|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=978-1-4832-1761-1|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little scientific knowledge about feral children. One of the best-documented cases has supposedly been that of sisters [[Amala and Kamala]], described by Reverend J. A. L. Singh in 1926 as having been "raised by wolves" in a forest in India. French surgeon [[Serge Aroles]], however, has persuasively argued that the case was a fraud, perpetrated by Singh in order to raise money for his orphanage. Child psychologist [[Bruno Bettelheim]] states that Amala and Kamala were born mentally and physically disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bettelheim|first1=Bruno|title=Feral Children and Autistic Children|journal=American Journal of Sociology|date=March 1959|volume=64|issue=5|pages=455–467|doi=10.1086/222541|url=https://autisticacademic.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/bettelheim-feral-children-and-autistic-children.pdf|jstor=2773433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet other scientific studies of feral children exist, such as the case of [[Genie (feral child)|Genie]].&lt;ref name="Curtiss2014"/&gt;

== History ==

Around the 20th century, psychologists were attempting to differentiate between behavior and biological culture. Feral children who lived in isolation or with animals provided examples of this dilemma.

Prior to the 1600s, feral and wild children stories were usually limited to myths and legends. In those tales, the depiction of feral children included hunting for food, running on all fours, and not knowing language. Philosophers and scientists were infatuated with such children, and began to question if these children were part of a different species from the human family.

The question was taken seriously as science tried to name and categorize the development of humans, and the understanding of the natural world in the 18th and 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/feral-children|title=Feral children|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documented cases of feral children==
===Raised by primates===
[[Marina Chapman]] lived with [[weeper capuchin]] monkeys in the [[Colombia]]n jungle from the age of four to about nine, following a botched kidnapping in about 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hattenstone|first1=Simon|title=Was Marina Chapman really brought up by monkeys?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/apr/13/marina-chapman-monkeys|accessdate=4 November 2017|work=The Guardian|date=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual for feral children, she went on to marry, have children and live a largely normal life with no persisting problems.

Robert (1982) lost his parents in the [[Ugandan Bush War|Ugandan Civil War]] at the age of three, when [[Milton Obote]]'s looting and murdering soldiers raided their village, around {{convert|50|mi|km|-1}} from [[Kampala]]. Robert then survived in the wild, presumably with [[vervet monkey]]s, for three years until he was found by soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Raised by monkeys, strugging to be human|url=https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1314386/raised-monkeys-strugging-human|accessdate=4 November 2017|work=New Vision|date=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saturday Mthiyane (or Mifune) (1987), a boy of around five, was found after spending about a year in the company of monkeys in [[KwaZulu-Natal]], South Africa. He was given the name Saturday after the day he was found, and Mthiyane was the name of the headmistress of the Special School which took him in. In 2005, at the age of around 17, he could still not talk, and still walked and jumped like a monkey. He never ate cooked food and refused to share or play with other children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://mg.co.za/article/1997-11-21-child-of-the-wild-still-spurns-life-as-a-human|title=Child of the wild still spurns life as a human|date=21 November 1997|work=Mail and Guardian|accessdate=4 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Ssebunya, from [[Uganda]], was a toddler when his mother died. Instead of going into a care facility, he went to live with vervet monkeys. For two years he learned how to forage and travel. The monkeys protected him in the wild. When he was around seven years old, he was brought back to civilization. The only form of communication he could do was cry, and he was described as always  wanting food. Some considered him “wild” and “scary.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/raised-in-the-wild-tales-of-survival-8165967.html|title=Raised in the wild: tales of survival|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his portrayal of Rodríguez, young actor Manuel Camacho received a ''Best New Actor'' nomination at the ''[[25th Goya Awards|2011 Goya Awards]]''.

===Raised by dogs===
[[Oxana Malaya]] was an eight-year-old girl who lived with dogs for six years. She was found in a kennel with dogs in 1991. She was neglected by her parents who were alcoholics. The three-year-old looking for comfort crawled into the farm and snuggled in with the dogs. Her behavior imitated dogs more than humans. She walked on all fours, bared her teeth, and barked. She was removed from her parents' custody by the social services.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} As she lacked human contact she did not know any words besides "yes" and "no".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20151012-feral-the-children-raised-by-wolves|title=Feral: The children raised by wolves|last=Macdonald|first=Fiona|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon adulthood, Oxana has been taught to subdue her dog-like behavior.

[[Ivan Mishukov]], a six-year-old boy was rescued by the police in 1998 from wild dogs, who he lived with for two years. He ran from his mother and her abusive alcoholic boyfriend at the age of four.

A 10-year-old Chilean boy (Dog Boy) was abandoned by his parents, lived with street dogs who hunted for food with him, and may have nursed him. At the age of five, the boy was abandoned by his parents and escaped a child care facility with 15 street dogs. The boy lived in a cave with the stray dogs and searched for food with them. He would search garbage cans to find leftover food to eat. He was raised by dogs since he was little. In 2001, he was found by the police, and he tried to escape by going into the water. However, he was caught and hospitalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=80914&amp;page=1|title='Dog Boy' of Chile Rescued|last=News|first=A. B.

Traian Căldărar, Romania (found in 2002) also known as "the Romanian Dog Boy" or "Mowgli". From the ages of four to seven, Trajan lived without his family. The boy was found at the age of seven and was described as a three-year-old due to undernutrition. His mother had left her home because of domestic violence, and Traian ran from home sometime after his mother left. He lived in the wild and took shelter in a cardboard box. He suffered from infected wounds, having poor circulation, and a children's disease caused by vitamin D deficiency. Traian was found by Manolescu Ioan, who had been walking across the country after his car broke down. In the surrounding area, a dog that had been eaten was also found. Many assume that the boy was eating the dog to stay alive. When Traian was being cared for, he would usually sleep under the bed and wanted to eat all the time. In 2007, Traian was being taken care of by his grandfather and was doing well in 3rd grade at school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sociologychis.wordpress.com/2016/05/12/modern-day-feral-children/|title=Modern day Feral children|date=2016-05-12|work=Sociologychis|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now, he is a normal child who likes football and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/romania/1390871/Wolf-boy-is-welcomed-home-by-mother-after-years-in-the-wild.html |title=Wolf boy is welcomed home by mother after years in the wild |accessdate=2014-07-02 |date=2002-04-14 |journal=Daily Telegraph | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrei Tolstyk (2004) was raised by dogs in a remote part of Siberia from the age of three months to 7 years. He was neglected by his parents because he had speaking and hearing problems. Social workers who found the boy were curious about why the boy was not admitted to his local school. This boy was not able to talk as he lacked human interaction and had many dog-like characteristics including walking on all fours, biting people, and sniffing his food before eating.&lt;ref name="The Independent"/&gt;

Madina, a three-year-old girl. Madina lived with dogs from birth until she was three years old. She slept with them in the cold, ate food with them, and played with them. Her father left her after she was born, and her mother became an alcoholic. She never looked after Madina since she was always too drunk and Madina would chew on bones from the floor with the dogs. When social workers found Madina in 2013, she acted like dogs and was not wearing any clothes. Madina was being taken care of and the doctors said that she was mentally and physically healthy even after what she had gone through.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Hany Istók (a.k.a. Steve of the Marsh) of Kapuvár, Hungary (1749). According to documents stored at the Catholic parish of Kapuvár, an abandoned child was once found in a marshy lakeside forest by two fishermen. He was brought to the town of Kapuvár, where he was christened and received the name Steven. The local governor took him to his castle and tried to raised him up, but the boy eventually escaped and ran back to the forest. Later, numerous folk tales developed around his character, depicting him as a "half fish, half human creature" who lived in a nearby lake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kapuvar.hu/varos/hanyistok/], "Hany Istók legendája" (Legend of Hany Istók)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramachandra (1970s and 1980s) – First reported in 1973 in the Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], at roughly 12 years old, and as living an [[amphibian]] lifestyle in the Kuano river. He was rescued in 1979 and taken to a nearby village. He only partly adapted to a conventional lifestyle, still preferring raw food, walking with an awkward gait, and spending most of his time alone in nearby rivers and streams. He died in 1982 after approaching a woman who was frightened by him, and who badly scalded Ramachandra with boiling water. Historian [[Mike Dash]]&lt;ref&gt;Dash, Mike Borderlands: The Ultimate Exploration of the Unknown; Overlook Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-87951-724-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; speculates that Ramachandra's uncharacteristically bold approach to the woman was sparked by a burgeoning sexual attraction coupled with his ignorance of cultural mores and taboos.

===Raised with sheep===
The historian [[Herodotus]] wrote that Egyptian [[pharaoh]] [[Psammetichus I]] (Psamtik) sought to discover the [[origin of language]] by conducting an experiment with two children. Allegedly, he gave two newborn babies to a shepherd, with the instructions that no one should speak to them, but that the shepherd should feed and care for them while listening to determine their first words. The hypothesis was that the first word would be uttered in the root language of all people. When one of the children cried “''bekos''” (a sound quite similar to the bleating of sheep) with outstretched arms the shepherd concluded that the word was [[Phrygian language|Phrygian]] because that was the sound of the Phrygian word for bread. Thus, they concluded that the Phrygians were an older people than the Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Herodotus| first=| authorlink=| others=George Rawlinson (translator)| title=The History of Herodotus| work=| publisher=| url=http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.2.ii.html| doi=| accessdate=November 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only seven months later, she had learned a vocabulary of around 1,500 to 2,000 words. She is reported to have acquired normal linguistic abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Clark | first=E.

[[Anna (feral child)|Anna]] (1938) was six years old when she was found, having been kept in a dark room for most of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://christopherjwwilkins.wordpress.com/2011/10/21/a-case-study-into-social-isolation-annas-story/|title=A case study into social isolation – Anna’s story|date=2011-10-21|work=The Thoughts and Ramblings of a Mad Man|access-date=2017-10-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was born in March 1932 in [[Pennsylvania]], [[United States]]. She was her mother's second illegitimate child. Her mother had tried to give Anna up for several months but no agency was willing to take the financial burden, as this was during the [[Great Depression]]. Anna was kept in a store room at least until she was five and half, out of the way of her disapproving grandfather, who was infuriated by her presence. Her mother also resented her, considering her troublesome. She was tied to a broken chair which was too small for her, and is believed to have also been tied to a cot for long periods of time. She was mostly fed milk and was never bathed, trained, or caressed by anyone. When she was found, she was suffering from [[malnutrition]] as well as [[muscle atrophy]]. She was immobile, expressionless, and indifferent to everything. She was believed to be deaf as she did not respond to others (later it was found that her deafness was functional rather than physical). She could not talk, walk, feed herself, or do anything that showed signs of cognition. Once she was taken away and placed in a foster home, she showed signs of improvement. At the age of nine she began to develop speech. She had started to conform to social norms and was able to feed herself, though only using a spoon. Her teachers described her as having a pleasant disposition. Anna passed away in August 1942 of hemorrhagic [[jaundice]].

Sujit Kumar (1979), named the “Chicken Boy of Fiji” by the media, was born with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Sujit's mother committed suicide when he was a toddler and his father left him confined under the house to live with the chickens. Sujit was rescued while still a boy and committed to the Samabula Old People's Home where he was confined to his room and tied to his bed. He could not speak and his only verbalisation was clucking; his only interaction with people consisted of outbursts. Sujit remained at the old people's home for 20 years until he was found by Elizabeth Clayton, a wealthy businesswoman who founded the Happy Home Trust to care for Sujit and other at risk Fijian children. Sujit's behaviour has improved, but he will never learn to speak and he remains profoundly disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4567|number=567|title=Feral Children|accessdate=25 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hoaxes ==
Following the 2008 disclosure by Belgian newspaper ''[[Le Soir]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archives.lesoir.be/?action=nav&amp;gps=580849 |title=Les aveux de Misha Defonseca}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the bestselling book ''[[Misha: A Mémoire of the Holocaust Years]]'' and movie ''Survivre avec les loups'' (“''Surviving with Wolves”'') was a media [[hoax]], the French media debated the credulity with which numerous cases of feral children have been unquestioningly accepted. Although there are numerous books on these children, almost none of them have been based on archives; the authors instead have used dubious second- or third-hand printed information. According to the French surgeon [[Serge Aroles]], who wrote a general study of feral children based on archives (''L'Enigme des Enfants-loups'' or ''The Enigma of Wolf-children'', 2007), many alleged cases are totally fictitious stories:
* The teenager of [[Braşov|Kronstadt]] (1781)&lt;ref name="Rauber" /&gt;{{rp|49–55}}&lt;ref name="Rauber_in_Chamber" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04112005-153758/unrestricted/11_Chapter2_deal.pdf |title=Chapter 2: Feral Children and Wranitzky’s Pantomime-Ballet Das Waldmädchen (1796) |accessdate=2007-06-18 |last=Deal |first=Bama Lutes |date=2005-04-01 |format=PDF |work=The Origin and Performance History of Carl Maria von Weber's Das Waldmädchen (1800) |publisher=[[Florida State University]] |page=16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701003432/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-04112005-153758/unrestricted/11_Chapter2_deal.pdf |archive-date=2007-07-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; – According to the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] document published by [[Serge Aroles]], this case is a hoax: the boy, mentally handicapped, had a [[goitre]] and was exhibited for money.
* Syrian Gazelle Boy (1946) – A boy aged around 10 was reported to have been found in the midst of a herd of [[gazelle]]s in the [[Syria]]n desert in the 1950s, and was only rescued with the help of an [[Iraqi army]] jeep, because he could run at speeds of up to 50&amp;nbsp;km/h. However, it was a hoax, as are the other gazelle-boy cases.
* [[Amala and Kamala]] – Claimed to have been found in 1920 by missionaries near [[Midnapore]], [[Calcutta]] region, [[India]], later proved to be a hoax to gain charity for Rev. Singh's orphanage.&lt;ref name="Aroles2007"/&gt;{{rp|104–113}} Scholars from Japan and France launched a new inquiry about Amala and Kamala, and validated the discoveries and conclusions done by Serge Aroles 20 years before: the story was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suzuki|first1=Kotaro|last2=Vauclair|first2=Jacques|title=De quelques mythes en psychologie : Enfants-loups, singes parlants et jumeaux fantômes|date=2016|publisher=Le Seuil|isbn=9782021103663|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The bear-girl of [[Krupina]], [[Slovakia]] (1767)&lt;ref name="Rauber" /&gt;{{rp|48–9}}&lt;ref name="Rauber_in_Chamber" /&gt; – Serge Aroles found no traces of her in the Krupina archives.

== Legend, fiction, and popular culture ==
{{Main|List of fictional feral children}}
Myths, legends, and fiction have depicted feral children reared by wild animals such as [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[ape]]s, [[monkey]]s, and [[bear]]s. Famous examples include [[Romulus and Remus]], [[Ibn Tufail]]’s [[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan|Hayy]], [[Ibn al-Nafis]]’ [[Ibn al-Nafis#Theologus Autodidactus|Kamil]], [[Rudyard Kipling]]’s [[Mowgli]], [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]’s [[Tarzan]], [[George of the Jungle]] and the legends of [[Atalanta]] and [[Enkidu]].

[[File:She-wolf suckles Romulus and Remus.jpg|thumb|The [[Capitoline Wolf]] suckling [[Romulus and Remus]].]]
Roman legend has it that [[Romulus and Remus]], twin sons of [[Rhea Silvia]] and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], were suckled by a [[She-wolf (Roman mythology)|she-wolf]]. Rhea Silvia was a priestess, and when it was found that she had been pregnant and had children, King [[Amulius]], who had usurped his brother's throne, ordered her to be buried alive and for the children to be killed. The servant who was given the order set them in a basket on the [[Tiber river]] instead, and the children were taken by [[Tiberinus (god)|Tiberinus]], the river god, to the shore where a she-wolf found them and raised them until they were discovered as toddlers by a shepherd named [[Faustulus]]. He and his wife [[Acca Larentia]], who had always wanted a child but never had one, raised the twins, who would later feature prominently in the events leading up to the founding of Rome (named after Romulus, who eventually killed Remus in a fight over whether the city should be founded on the [[Palatine Hill]] or the [[Aventine Hill]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Plutarch  | authorlink =  | others = John Dryden (translator) | title = Romulus | url = http://classics.mit.edu/Plutarch/romulus.html | doi =  | accessdate = November 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legendary and fictional children are often depicted as growing up with relatively normal [[Intelligence#Human intelligence|human intelligence]] and skills and an innate sense of culture or civilization, coupled with a healthy dose of [[Self preservation|survival instincts]]. Their integration into human society is made to seem relatively easy. One notable exception is Mowgli, for whom living with humans proved to be extremely difficult.

The subject is treated with a certain amount of realism in [[François Truffaut]]’s 1970 film ''[[L'Enfant Sauvage|L’Enfant Sauvage]]'' (UK: ''The Wild Boy'', US: ''[[The Wild Child]]''), where a scientist's efforts in trying to rehabilitate a feral boy meet with great difficulty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/897470428|title=François Truffaut : The Lost Secret|last=Gillain|first=Anne|publisher=Indiana University Press (Ind.)|year=2013|isbn=9780253008459|location=|page=215|translator-last=Fox|translator-first=Alistair,|oclc=897470428|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arthur Boyd Houghton00.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;[[Arthur Boyd Houghton]] cartoon published by ''Fun'' magazine in 1886]]
'''''Fun''''' was a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] weekly [[magazine]], first published on 21 September 1861.&lt;ref&gt;''Fun'', volume 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was founded by the actor and playwright [[H. J. Byron]] in competition with ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' magazine. ''Fun'' ceased publication in 1901, when it was absorbed into ''Sketchy Bits''.

==Description==
[[Image:Darwin sexual caricature.gif|thumb|upright|Caricature of Darwin contemplating a [[bustle]], from ''Fun'', 16th Nov, 1872]]
Like ''Punch'', the journal published satiric verse and parodies, as well as political and literary criticism, sports and travel information. These were often illustrated or accompanied by topical cartoons (often of a political nature). The ''Punch'' mascot, Mr. Punch, and his dog Toby were lampooned by Fun's jester, Mr. Fun, and his cat.&lt;ref name=storyboard&gt;[http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/projects/disraeli/funstoryboard.html ''Fun'' (1861–1901)], [[Bodleian Library]], accessed 21 July 2012 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206171634/http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/projects/disraeli/funstoryboard.html |date=2007-02-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine was aimed at a well-educated readership interested in politics, literature, and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Vann, J. Don, "Comic Periodicals," in ''Victorian Periodicals &amp; Victorian Society'' (Aldershot: Scholar Press, 1994), pp. 284-5)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Fun'' was sold for a penny and was sometimes characterised as a 'poor man's ''Punch'''. [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]] called it "Funch".&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Alvin, ''British Literary Magazines: The Victorian and Edwardian Age'', 1837-1913 (London: Greenwood Press, 1984), p. 135)&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fun'' silenced its critics by publishing lively fare, whereas ''Punch'' was criticised as dull and tired. One area in which ''Fun'' clearly bested its rival was in its close connection to popular theatre.

Byron and his successor as editor, [[Tom Hood]], the son of the first ''Punch'' contributor, assembled a vivacious, bohemian and progressive staff. Notable contributors included playwrights [[Thomas William Robertson|Tom Robertson]], Hood, [[Clement Scott]], [[F. C. Burnand]] (who defected to ''Punch'' in 1862), satirist [[Ambrose Bierce]], [[G. R. Sims]] and especially [[W. S. Gilbert]], whose [[Bab Ballads]] were almost all published in its pages, among other articles, poems, illustrations and drama criticism over a ten-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stedman|first=Jane W.|year=1996|title=W. S. Gilbert &amp;ndash; A Classic Victorian and His Theatre|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press}}, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Cartoonists included [[Arthur Boyd Houghton]], [[Matt Morgan (cartoonist)|Matt Morgan]] and James Francis Sullivan (1852–1936). The ''Fun'' gang frequented the Arundel Club, the [[Savage Club]], and especially Evans's café, where they had a table in competition with the ''Punch'' 'Round table'.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://journals.mup.man.ac.uk/cgi-bin/pdfdisp//MUPpdf/NCTF/V30I2/300001.pdf Schoch, Richard, ''Performing Bohemia'' (2004)] (accessed March 13, 2007). See also Tom Robertson's play ''[[Society (play)|Society]]'', which fictionalised the evenings in Evans's café in one scene.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though ''Fun'' was seen as liberal in comparison with the increasingly conservative ''Punch'', it could cast satirical scorn or praise on either side of the political spectrum. For instance, [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraeli]], whose unorthodox character and ethnic lineage made him a popular focus of attack, was praised in the magazine, including for his Reform Bill of 1867.&lt;ref name=storyboard/&gt;

==History==
Byron ceded the editorship of the paper to Hood in 1865 and sold ''Fun'' to engravers and publishers [[dalziel Brothers|George and Edward Dalziel]] in 1870, who had previously engraved drawings for ''Punch''. Two years later they transferred it to their nephew Gilbert Dalziel (1853–1930). After the death of Hood and the end of contributions from Gilbert by 1874, the quality of the content began a slow decline. During the 1870s, the circulation of ''Fun'' is estimated at 20,000, compared with ''Punch'''s 40,000.&lt;ref&gt;Ellegard, Alvar, "The Readership of the Periodical Press in Mid-Victorian Britain," in ''Victorian Periodicals Newsletter'', 3 (September, 1971), p. 20)&lt;/ref&gt; Hood was succeeded as editor by Henry Sampson until 1878, and then the editorship devolved to Charles Dalziel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsp.com/data/data127.html Publisher and editor data]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1893, the Dalziels withdrew from the journal.

''Fun'' ceased publication in 1901, when it was absorbed into ''Sketchy Bits''.&lt;ref&gt;Hiley, Nicholas. [http://find.galegroup.com/ukpc/topicguide/ncup_15.htm "Comic Periodicals"], ''19th Century UK Periodicals'', Detroit: [[Gale (publisher)|Gale]] (2008), accessed May 10, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gillman Barracks''' is a contemporary arts cluster in Singapore that is home to international art galleries, restaurants and the NTU Centre for Contemporary Art (CCA) Singapore, which are all housed in conserved colonial barracks. Gillman Barracks lies near to Alexandra Road, and the 6.4 hectare site covers Lock Road and Malan Road amid greenery. Gillman Barracks is jointly developed by the [[Singapore Economic Development Board]], [[JTC Corporation]] and the [[National Arts Council (Singapore)|National Arts Council]].

== History ==
[[File:Gillman Barracks Block 9.jpg|thumb|Block 9 of Gillman Barracks|204x204px]]

Gillman Barracks housed the 1st Battalion, [[Middlesex Regiment]] a line infantry regiment of the British Army, and the 2nd Battalion, [[Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire)|Loyal Regiment]] of the British Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1395_2008-12-06.html|title=NLB Infopedia|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was to accommodate the expansion of the British infantry in Singapore. The camp included married quarters for the officers, barracks buildings, sports facilities, messes, regimental institutes and even a swimming pool. 

Gillman Barracks was one of the last British outposts to fall to the Japanese during the Second World War, where the Regiment fought the Japanese three days before Singapore fell in February 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gillmanbarracks.com/files/press/Factsheet---Gillman-Barracks/file/Factsheet_Gillman%20Barracks%20(15Jan2014).pdf|title=Gillman Barracks Factsheet|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Japanese surrender on 14 August 1945, command of the base transferred to the returning British forces.

In August 1971, the British handed over Gillman Barracks to the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF) for a token sum of $1, as part of their withdrawal from Singapore. For the next 13 years, it served as the headquarters for the School of Combat Engineering and the 3rd Transport Battalion.  In the early 1970s, some of the buildings were also used by the [[Singapore American School]] for classroom space. In 1984, a similar handover was done between the School of Combat Engineering and the SAF Transport Base, with $1 being the handover fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/singmonitor19841102-1.2.6.6|title=NewspaperSG - Terms and Conditions|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gillman Barracks was later vacated in 1990 and used subsequently for commercial purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gillmanbarracks.com/files/press/20120823-gillman-barracks-art-galleries-to-open-se/file/20120824-gillman-barracks-art-galleries-to-open-september-15.pdf|title=EDB Singapore Media Release: Gillman Barracks Art Galleries to Open September 15|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the SAF vacated the camp in the 1990s, the buildings were used for commercial purposes and the site was renamed Gillman Village in 1996. The main colonial building was repainted and renovated to include commercial spaces such as cafés, restaurants, bars and furniture shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://issuu.com/00sunyata/docs/gillman_barracks_singapore|title=Where History and Art Meet - Gillman Barracks|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was to draw people to this slightly hidden enclave with the promise of colonial charm and delicious food and beverage options. However, Gillman Village was not very successful due to its isolated location and it had little human traffic.

In 2002, the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] (URA) declared Identity Plans for 15 areas in Singapore, with Gillman Village being one of that 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ura.gov.sg/uol/media-room/news/2002/jul/pr02-42|title=URA launches Identity Plans for 15 areas in Singapore|website=www.ura.gov.sg|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grouped under the Southern Ridges and Hillside Villages category, the plan was to "enhance (the) activities" within this area through the introduction of "new buildings" and the act of "bringing in more activities". The Identity Plans were met with strong public support, as shown by surveys done at the URA centre from 23 July to 23 October 2002. 72% of respondents agreed with the proposed enhancements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ura.gov.sg/uol/media-room/news/2002/nov/pr02-66|title=URA's Parks &amp; Waterbodies and Identity Plans receive strong public support|website=www.ura.gov.sg|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010,&lt;ref&gt;Singapore Economic Development Board. (2011). Singapore Economic Development Board calls for Expressions of Interests (EOI) for galleries to set up in Gillman Barracks extended to 26 August 2011 [Press release]. Retrieved October 25, 2011, from http://www.edb.gov.sg/edb/sg/en_uk/index/news/articles/sedb_calls_for_expressions_of_interest_for_galleries_to_set_up_in_gillman_barracks.html&lt;/ref&gt; the Singapore government announced plans to redevelop Gillman Village, reverting to its original name, Gillman Barracks. Gillman Barracks was launched in September 2012 as a contemporary art centre with 13 art galleries joining its ranks, including well-established galleries such as Tomio Koyama Gallery and Sundaram Tangore Gallery.&lt;ref&gt;Poon, C. H. (2011, June 19). Home for art galleries at Gillman Barracks. The Straits Times. Retrieved October 25, 2011, from Factiva.&lt;/ref&gt; The area is now a site for arts-related activities, where various agencies like the [[Economic Development Board]] (Development and Promotion), [[JTC Corporation]] (Refurbishment and Construction) and [[National Arts Council (Singapore)|National Arts Council]] (Promotion of Singapore Arts Scene) work together to develop this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/new-life-old-barracks|title=New life for old barracks|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2015, five galleries—almost a third of the 17 galleries there—did not renew their leases, citing low human traffic, poor sales and a slow start to the arts enclave. This came after "three years of persistently low footfall".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shetty|first1=Deepkia|title=Nearly a third of Gillman Barracks galleries have decided not to renew their leases|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/nearly-a-third-of-gillman-barracks-galleries-have-decided-not-to-renew-their-leases|accessdate=9 April 2016|agency=The Straits Times|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|date=11 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, [[Galerie Michael Janssen]] also left, citing how they "felt the project has not taken off as envisioned". Singapore design label [[Supermama]], ice cream shop [[Creamier]] and Australian gallery [[Sullivan+Strumpf]] moved in instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shetty|first1=Deepkia|title=Home-grown brands Supermama and Creamier open at Gillman Barracks|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/home-grown-brands-supermama-and-creamier-open-at-gillman-barracks|accessdate=9 April 2016|agency=The Straits Times|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Buildings ==

=== Block 9 ===

[[File:Corridors of Block 9.jpg|thumb|192x192px|Corridors of Block 9]]
Known as the primary colonial building, it once housed some of the British Army’s most well-known warrant officers, such as General Sir Webb Gillman himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goingplacessingapore.sg/heritage/2016/GillmanBarracks|title=Building secrets: Gillman Barracks|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This building served as the officers’ married quarters, with recreational activities such as badminton carried out in the open spaces in front of the building. Today, the main colonial building has been named Block 9 in Gillman Barracks, the main and biggest block in the contemporary arts cluster. The similar colonial architecture has been preserved, and has survived various transformations in the Gillman area. Similar big windows, wide corridors and high arches are still present, allowing for good ventilation within the building.

=== The Army Kinema Corporation (AKC) ===

[[File:Block 7 in Gillman Barracks.jpg|thumb|193x193px|Block 7 in Gillman Barracks]]
After the Second World War, the British War Office in London established the Army Kinema Corporation and set up the Regal Cinema at Gillman Barracks to entertain the British troops stationed there. Movies were screened twice nightly except Tuesday nights, ranging from films such as ''Ben Hur'' (1959) and ''Jailhouse Rock'' (1957). During the time of Gillman Village, the same building was preserved, but served a different purpose. It was known as the Verve Bar &amp; Bistro. The AKC (Army Kinima Corporation) logo remained on the side of the building, and was repainted. After the redevelopment of Gillman Village into Gillman Barracks, the building serves commercial art galleries and exhibitions, while still preserving its famous AKC logo at the exterior of the building. It is also known as Block 7 today, the only block with a pointed roof within Gillman Barracks.

=== Bourne School ===

[[File:Covered side steps to Bourne School near Block 37.jpg|thumb|195x195px|Side steps to previous Bourne School now covered by art fixtures and dense vegetation]]
From 1945 onwards, the British Forces Schools once operated within the Army and Naval Bases in Singapore.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mimiworld-catcat17spiritual.blogspot.sg/2015/08/the-lost-soul-of-bourne-school.html|title=The Lost Soul of Bourne School|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexandra Grammar School was built on top of the hill at Gillman Barracks, and later renamed Bourne Secondary School in 1964. Students would take the side steps up to Bourne School at the top of hill.  The school has since relocated to Preston Road, and is now known as the ISS International School – not too far from where Gillman Barracks is. Today, the similar side steps which used to lead up to the school are covered up by grown trees and vegetation, with art fixtures near Block 37.

== Vision ==
In its conception, the Gillman Barracks aims to foster cultural exchange and creation, generating discourse and research and showcasing innovative art. The galleries, education and outreach efforts are to establish Singapore as an important centre for contemporary art in Asia.

The art cluster is an effort to create vibrant arts scene in Singapore made up of public museums, commercial galleries, non-profit spaces, and major art events such as the [[Singapore Biennale]] and [[Art Stage Singapore]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gillmanbarracks.com/about|title=About Gillman Barracks|website=Gillman Barracks|accessdate=2015-09-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906171025/https://www.gillmanbarracks.com/about|archivedate=2015-09-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vision promotes Gillman Barracks as a contemporary arts space – to display and sell art – while preserving part of the area’s colonial history. Today, various colonial barracks, including Block 9, are home to art galleries, shops and restaurants.

==Galleries==
[[File:NTU Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore.jpg|alt=1935|right|thumb|NTU Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore]]
The galleries feature diverse exhibitions from internationally acclaimed artists, of [[Southeast Asia]] and around the world. Artists include both the established and emerging such as Alfredo and Isabel Aquilizan, Heman Chong, [[Ai Weiwei]], [[Yayoi Kusama]], [[Yoshitomo Nara]] and [[Sebastião Salgado]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Tours are also provided by Friends of the Museums, giving the public insight to the art located within the Barracks, as well as the Barracks' rich history and heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gillman Barracks Tours|url = https://www.gillmanbarracks.com/tours|website = Gillman Barracks|accessdate = 2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gillman Barracks Galleries|url = https://www.gillmanbarracks.com/art-galleries|website = Gillman Barracks|accessdate = 2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gillmanbarracks.com/art-galleries&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and outreach ==
Gillman Barracks is also home to several art institutions and charities, including: 
*'''[[Nanyang Technological University]]''' '''Centre for Contemporary Arts''' - devoted to advancing knowledge in contemporary art through its international artist residencies, research and exhibition programmes that will bolster the region’s visual arts landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.adm.ntu.edu.sg/Research/Centre%20of%20Contemporary%20Art/Pages/Home.aspx|title = School of Art, Design and Media: NTU Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore|date = |accessdate = |website = NTU School of Art, Design and Media|publisher = Nanyang Technological University|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Art Outreach''' - a non-profit art education organisation that promotes art appreciation in Singapore started in 2003. The programme exposes participants to the world of art and promotes visual literacy.

'''''Henry and June: From the Unexpurgated Diary of Anaïs Nin''''' (full title ''Henry and June: From A Journal of Love: the Unexpurgated Diary of Anaïs Nin (1931&amp;ndash;1932)'') is a 1986 book that is based upon material excerpted from the unpublished diaries of [[Anaïs Nin]]. 
It corresponds temporally to the first volume of Nin's published diaries, written between October 1931 and October 1932, yet is radically different, in that that book begins with a description of the landscape of and around her home and never mentions her husband, whereas "Henry and June" begins with discussion of Nin's sex life and is full of her struggles and passionate relationship with husband Hugo, and then, as the novel/memoir progresses, other lovers.

This, the first of currently five volumes of unexpurgated diaries, concentrates on her passionate involvement with the writer [[Henry Miller]] and his wife [[June Miller]].

It is noteworthy that Nin's source material —her diaries —was able to spawn two dramatically different narratives about the same time period, both widely read and praised. The expurgated diary reveals Nin the philosopher and amateur but astute psychologist. The unexpurgated diary reveals a woman breaking out into wild sexual discovery. It is introduced by her second—[[Bigamy|bigamous]]—husband.

[[Henry &amp; June|A film based on the book]] was released in 1990.

== Plot ==
At the end of 1931, Nin finds herself dissatisfied with being a timid, faithful wife to her banker husband, [[Hugh Parker Guiler]]. Nin and her husband contemplate the possibility of opening their relationship, and determine that it would threaten their marriage. However, when Anais meets June Miller, she is magnetically drawn to her and perceives June to be the most beautiful and charismatic woman she has ever met. Nin pursues an extremely intense, ambiguous, sexually charged friendship with her. When June leaves, Nin becomes involved with Henry, and begins an uninhibited sexual and emotional affair with him, which prompts an intellectual and sensual awakening. A friendship is formed between the two that was maintained throughout both artist's lives.

== Adaptations ==
The book was later filmed as ''[[Henry &amp; June]]'' directed by [[Philip Kaufman]], with [[Fred Ward]] as Miller, [[Uma Thurman]] as June, and [[Maria de Medeiros]] as Anaïs Nin. The movie, released in 1990, is notable as the first film to be released in the United States with an [[NC-17]] rating.

The same year the book was also adapted into a film as ''[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100682/ The Room of Words ({{Lang|it|La stanza delle parole}})]'', a low-budget Italian production directed by Franco Molé.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5436">The '''Heresies Collective''' was founded in 1976 in [[New York City]], by a group of [[feminist]] political artists. The group sought to, among other goals, examine art from a feminist and political perspective. In addition to a variety of actions and cultural output, the collective was responsible for the overseeing the publication of the journal [[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics|Heresies: A feminist publication on art and politics]], which was published from 1977 until 1993.

== Background ==
The Heresies Collective was founded in 1976 by a group of feminist artists, with the goal of increasing discourse around the ideas of feminism, politics, and their relationship to art. The Heresies Collective's primary output was a reoccurring publication titled [[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics|Heresies: A feminist publication on art and politics]]. The goals of the collective, through the publication of their journal, were to encourage the writing of feminist history, generate new creative energies among women artists, broaden the definition of art, and articulate diversity within the art world. In addition to the goals of encouraging and supporting feminist political art, the collective sought to stimulate dialogue around radical political and esthetic theory, and reject the [[capitalist]] framework of the art world through interrogating the processes by which art is created, critiqued, and consumed.&lt;ref name=Collective&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heresies Collective|title=Feminism, Art and Politics|journal=Heresies: A feminist publication on art and politics|date=January 1977|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://heresiesfilmproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/heresies1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Members===
The founding collective members listed in the first publication were:&lt;ref name=Collective/&gt; [[Patsy Beckert]], [[Joan Braderman]], [[Mary Beth Edelson]], [[Harmony Hammond]], [[Elizabeth Hess]], [[Joyce Kozloff]], [[Arlene Ladden]], [[Lucy Lippard]], [[Mary Miss]], [[Marty Pottenger]], [[Miriam Schapiro]], [[Joan Snyder]], [[Elke Solomon]], [[Pat Steir]], [[May Stevens]], [[Susana Torre]], [[Elizabeth Weatherford]], [[Sally Webster]], and [[Nina Yankowitz]].

Numerous other feminist artists contributed to the publication over the years, and participated in the collective structure. The film, The Heretics, by collective member [[Joan Braderman]], lists the following additional women as members of the Heresies Collective:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Braderman|first1=Joan|title=The Women|url=http://heresiesfilmproject.org/the-women/|website=The Heretics|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joan Snyder]], [[Pat Steir]], [[Michelle Stuart]], [[Emma Amos (painter)|Emma Amos]], Patsy Beckert, [[Janet Froelich]], [[Su Friedrich]], [[Ida Applebroog]], Sue Heinemann, [[Sabra Moore]], [[Miriam Schapiro]], [[Cecilia Vicuna]], [[Nina Yankowitz]], and [[Amy Sillman]].

==Collective Activities==
While the publication was the primary activity of the collective, members of the group were also involved with other arts and political movements in New York. The collective was featured in an exhibit at the [[New Museum]] in 1983, titled [[Classified: Big Pages from the Heresies Collective]]. The exhibit featured large scale works from members of the collective, and was curated in part by [[En Foco]], as part of the Events series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carson|first1=Julie|chapter=On Discourse as Monument: Institutional Spaces and Feminist Problematics|editor1-last=Ault|editor1-first=Julie|title=Alternative art, New York, 1965 - 1985: a cultural politics book for the Social Text Collective|date=2002|publisher=Drawing Center|location=New York|pages=121–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 the collective staged a demonstration in front of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] called the [[Women Artists Visibility Event (W.A.V.E.) / Let MOMA Know|Women Artists Visibility Event (W.A.V.E.)]], or Let MOMA Know, aimed at raising awareness about the poor representation of women artists at the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voices.revealdigital.com/cgi-bin/independentvoices?a=d&amp;d=DFDEGHA19840601.1.2&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN---------------1|title="Let MOMA Know: Women Artists Visibility Event (W.A.V.E) at the Museum of Modern Art on Flag Day, 14 June 1984"|last=Osterman|first=Gladys|date=1984|website=Independent Voices|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Heresies Collective was also the subject of a documentary film, called ''[[The Heretics]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Emily|title="The Heretics": Women of the Heresies Collective|url=http://www.womensmediacenter.com/feature/entry/the-heretics-women-of-the-heresies-collective|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was conceived and directed by Heresies Collective member [[Joan Braderman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Braderman|first1=Joan|title=Synopsis|url=http://heresiesfilmproject.org/synopsis/|website=The Heretics|accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ironclad: Battle for Blood''''' is a 2014 [[Epic film|epic]] [[war film]] directed by [[Jonathan English]]. It is the sequel to his 2011 film ''[[Ironclad (film)|Ironclad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/ironclad-battle-blood-film-review-717930 'Ironclad: Battle for Blood': Film Review - The Hollywood Reporter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Five years after the events of ''Ironclad'', the de Vesci family struggles with [[Scottish people|Scot]] raiders along the [[Anglo-Scottish border|English-Scottish border]]. A blood feud begins after the Scot chieftain's son is killed in one of these raids. The wounded de Vesci patriarch, Gilbert, sends his son Hubert to seek help from his nephew, a "great warrior" named Guy de Lusignan.

This Guy is revealed to be none other than [[William d'Aubigny (rebel)|Baron d'Aubigny]]'s idealistic [[squire]] from ''Ironclad''. Unable to find peace after the events at Rochester, he has grown into a cynical, hard-bitten fighting man who makes a living in [[mercenary]] work and underground bloodsports. Shrugging off Hubert’s appeal to family, he demands payment for his services and those of his partner Berenger, forcing Hubert to hand over the last of the de Vesci fortune. To bolster their numbers, Guy saves a condemned murderer called Crazy Mary with a bribe, but end up getting "two for the price of one" when authorities come after the headsman, Pierrepoint, for selling prisoners.

Hubert leads the four mercenaries back to the besieged de Vesci castle, and they help the garrison beat back the Scot attacks. Guy's reunion with his relations proves awkward. His beautiful, spoiled cousin Blanche spurns him at first, especially after learning that he came for money instead of family, but begins to warm to him after he saves her from Scot infiltrators.

Casualties mount as the siege drags on. Gilbert de Vesci dies of his wound, passing his lordship on to Hubert. His wife Joan later takes poison to join him, believing the battle lost. Pierrepoint is murdered by Mary, who held a grudge against her would-be executioner. At last, the Scots resort to fire, burning down the castle gates and storming the keep. Berenger, caught outside, nearly wins a duel with the Scot chieftain before the raiders interrupt and kill him. Hubert entrusts his sisters to Guy before making a last stand with Mary as lord of the castle.

The Scots overpower Hubert and Mary, executing the latter by hanging. To spare Hubert the same fate, Guy recalls his honor and heritage and challenges the Scot chieftain to single combat. He emerges victorious with unexpected help from Blanche. With their leader dead, the clan renounces the blood feud and returns to the hills. An epilogue narrated by Hubert reveals that despite his apparent change of heart at the siege’s end, Guy stayed on the mercenary path, and went on to ply his trade in the [[Hundred Years' War]] in [[Kingdom of France|France]].

==Cast==
* [[Tom Austen]] as Guy de Lusignan, a hardened mercenary who fought as a squire at the famous siege of Rochester Castle
* [[David Rintoul]] as Gilbert de Vesci, a former [[Crusades|Crusader]] and lord of the de Vesci castle
* [[Michelle Fairley]] as Joan de Vesci, Gilbert’s wife
* [[Tom Rhys Harries]] as Hubert de Vesci, Gilbert’s son
* [[Roxanne McKee]] as Blanche de Vesci, Gilbert’s spoiled older daughter  
* [[Rosie Day]] as Kate de Vesci, Gilbert’s younger daughter 
* [[Danny Webb (actor)|Danny Webb]] as Smith, Gilbert’s doughty manservant
* [[David Caves]] as Berenger, Guy’s friend and fellow mercenary who owes him a life debt
* [[Twinnie Lee Moore]] as Crazy Mary, a condemned murderer
* [[Andy Beckwith]] as Pierrepoint (Charles Montserrat de Pierrepoint III), an executioner
* [[Predrag Bjelac]] as Maddog, chieftain of the Scot raiders

==Links to the first film==

The film is based on an entirely new story, with only scattered callbacks to its predecessor.

The rebellion and the fight against King John at Rochester are referenced, as are some characters. Archbishop Langton ([[Charles Dance]]), who is mentioned by name, helped Guy settle in a monastery to find peace after the great siege. Guy also recalls the words of Thomas Marshall ([[James Purefoy]]) in an exchange about the nobility of killing.

There is also a parallel between the characters of Jedediah Coteral ([[Jamie Foreman]]) and Pierrepoint, in the form of purchasing prisoners to serve as mercenaries. In particular, Baron d’Aubigny’s ([[Brian Cox (actor)|Brian Cox]]) question to Coteral before freeing him, “Are you sorry for your sins?”, is repeated by Pierrepoint to his victims.

==Historical inaccuracies==

The epilogue states that Guy fought in the Hundred Years’ War. This is impossible as that war began in 1337, and the film is set five years after the Siege of Rochester Castle which took place in 1215.

==Reception==
Guy Lodge of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that English "rehashes most of his technical devices from the first film" and noted that the "production and costume design on the Serbian-shot production are economically restrained," though "Andreas Weidinger’s kitschily choral score is anything but."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-ironclad-battle-for-blood-1201268246/ |title=Film Review: ''Ironclad: Battle for Blood'' |first=Guy |last=Lodge |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=24 July 2014 |accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Kraków Dance Theatre''' ('''''Krakowski Teatr Tańca''''') is a [[Contemporary dance|dance theatre]] that evolved in 2008 from the GRUPAboso Dance Theatre (founded in 1996) and works under the artistic direction of Eryk Makohon at the Nowa Huta Centre of Culture in [[Kraków]], [[Poland]].

In 2008 the Krakowski Teatr Tańca GRUPAboso Association was established, whose aim is to support the artistic and educational activities of the Theatre.

In 2010 the METAphysical Laboratory was established as the source of new [[dancer]]s. The students-dancers of the Laboratory have become the guest dancers of the Theatre and they have an opportunity to create their own [[Choreography|choreographies]] with a professional support.

Some of the company's awards were won at: the Tychy Theatre Meetings (2007, 2009), the Polish Contemporary Dance Confrontation in [[Konin]] (2009), the Polish edition of the Solo &amp; Duo Dance Festival (2009 and 2010). Additionally, the company represented Poland at the 13th Biennial of Young Artists from [[Europe]] and the [[Mediterranean]], which took place in May 2008 in [[Bari]] ([[Italy]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="66923">'''Music recording certifications''' are typically awarded by the global [[music industry]] based on the total units sold, streamed, or shipped to retailers. These awards and their requirements are defined by the various [[Music recording sales certification|certifying]] bodies representing the music industry in various countries and territories worldwide. The standard certification awards given consist of Gold, Platinum, and sometimes Diamond awards, in ascending order; the UK also has a Silver certification, ranking below Gold. In most cases, a "Multi-Platinum" or "Multi-Diamond" award is given for multiples of the Platinum or Diamond requirements.

Many music industries around the world are represented by the [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI). The IFPI operates in 66 countries and services affiliated industry associations in 45 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.ifpi.org/content/section_about/index.html
 | accessdate = 2010-05-18
 | publisher = [[IFPI]]
 | title = IFPI's Mission}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the IFPI is merely affiliated with the already operational certification bodies of a country, but in many others countries with lesser-developed industries, the IFPI acts as the sole certifying body servicing the country or region's music industry. Still other countries not represented by the IFPI have certifying bodies operating independently, such as individual record companies which service the country or region's music industry as a whole.

Though all certifying bodies give awards for [[album]] sales or shipments, many also certify [[Single (music)|singles]], paid [[Music download|digital download]]s, [[music video]]s, music [[DVD]]s, and [[Audio mastering|master]] [[ringtone]]s. Additionally, some certifying bodies have separate threshold scales for works of domestic or international origins, varying genres, lengths, and formats. From the 2010s digital streaming was included in some territories.

==Albums==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2747">The '''Lunning Prize''' was instituted by [[Frederik Lunning]], owner of the New York agency for [[Georg Jensen]].  The prize was awarded to eminent Scandinavian designers, two each year, from 1951 to 1970.  The recipients were selected by a group of peers from [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]].

The Lunning Prize and its recipients were instrumental in establishing the concept and profile of [[Scandinavian Design]], both at home and abroad, during this vital period.

'''Macrocephaly-capillary malformation''' ('''M-CM''') is a multiple malformation syndrome causing abnormal body and head overgrowth and [[cutaneous]], [[vascular]], [[neurologic]], and limb abnormalities.  Though not every patient has all features, commonly found signs include [[macrocephaly]], congenital [[macrosomia]], extensive cutaneous capillary malformation ([[naevus flammeus]] or [[port-wine stain]] type birthmark over much of the body; a capillary malformation of the upper lip or philtrum is seen in many patients with this condition), body asymmetry (also called hemihyperplasia or [[hemihypertrophy]]), [[polydactyly]] or [[syndactyly]] of the hands and feet, lax joints, doughy skin, variable [[developmental delay]] and other neurologic problems such as [[seizures]] and [[low muscle tone]].

==Genetics==

Mosaic mutations in [[PIK3CA]] have been found to be the genetic cause of M-CM.&lt;ref name="Rivière-2012"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Rivière | first1 = JB. | last2 = Mirzaa | first2 = GM. | last3 = O'Roak | first3 = BJ. | last4 = Beddaoui | first4 = M. | last5 = Alcantara | first5 = D. | last6 = Conway | first6 = RL. | last7 = St-Onge | first7 = J. | last8 = Schwartzentruber | first8 = JA. | last9 = Gripp | first9 = KW. | last10 = Nikkel | first10 = Sarah M | last11 = Worthylake | first11 = Thea | last12 = Sullivan | first12 = Christopher T | last13 = Ward | first13 = Thomas R | last14 = Butler | first14 = Hailly E | last15 = Kramer | first15 = Nancy A | last16 = Albrecht | first16 = Beate | last17 = Armour | first17 = Christine M | last18 = Armstrong | first18 = Linlea | last19 = Caluseriu | first19 = Oana | last20 = Cytrynbaum | first20 = Cheryl | last21 = Drolet | first21 = Beth A | last22 = Innes | first22 = A Micheil | last23 = Lauzon | first23 = Julie L | last24 = Lin | first24 = Angela E | last25 = Mancini | first25 = Grazia M S | last26 = Meschino | first26 = Wendy S | last27 = Reggin | first27 = James D | last28 = Saggar | first28 = Anand K | last29 = Lerman-Sagie | first29 = Tally | last30 = Uyanik | first30 = Gökhan | title = De novo germline and postzygotic mutations in AKT3, PIK3R2 and PIK3CA cause a spectrum of related megalencephaly syndromes | journal = Nat Genet | volume = 44 | issue = 8 | pages = 934–40 | month =  | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1038/ng.2331 | pmid = 22729224 | display-authors = 8 | pmc = 3408813 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other overgrowth conditions with distinct phenotypes have also been found to be caused by mosaic mutations in PIK3CA.

==Diagnosis ==

Diagnosis is usually based on clinical observation. Various sets of criteria have been suggested to identify the disorder in an individual patient, all of which include macrocephaly and a number of the following: somatic overgrowth, cutis marmorata, midline facial birthmark, polydactyly/syndactyly, asymmetry (hemihyperplasia or hemihypertrophy), hypotonia at birth, developmental delay, connective tissue defect and frontal bossing.&lt;ref name="pmid10710221"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Franceschini P, Licata D, Di Cara G, Guala A, Franceschini D, Genitori L | title=Macrocephaly-Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita without cutis marmorata? | journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics | year= 2000 | volume= 90 | issue= 4 | pages= 265–9 | pmid=10710221 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1096-8628(20000214)90:4&lt;265::AID-AJMG1&gt;3.0.CO;2-S| url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=clinical.uthscsa.edu/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=10710221 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10649789"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Robertson SP, Gattas M, Rogers M, Adès LC | title=Macrocephaly--cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita: report of five patients and a review of the literature. | journal=Clin Dysmorphol | year= 2000 | volume= 9 | issue= 1 | pages= 1–9 | pmid=10649789 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=clinical.uthscsa.edu/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=10649789 | doi=10.1097/00019605-200009010-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently no consensus exists about which diagnostic criteria are definitive and so evaluation by a medical geneticist or other clinician with familiarity with the syndrome is usually needed to provide diagnostic certainty. It is not clear if there are some features which are mandatory to make the diagnosis, but [[macrocephaly]] appears essentially universal though may not be congenital. The distinctive vascular abnormalities of the skin often fade over time, making the diagnosis challenging in older children with this condition.

The brain can be affected in several ways in this syndrome. Some children are born with structural brain anomalies such as [[cortical dysplasia]] or [[polymicrogyria]]. While [[developmental delay]] is nearly universal in this syndrome it is variable in severity, with the majority having mild to moderate delays and a minority having severe cognitive impairment. Some patients are affected with a seizure disorder. [[White matter]] abnormalities on [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), suggesting a delay in white matter [[myelination]], is commonly seen in early childhood. Some patients may have asymmetry of the brain, with one side being noticeably larger than the other.

One interesting phenomenon that seems very common in this syndrome is the tendency for disproportionate brain growth in the first few years of life, with crossing of percentiles on the head circumference growth charts. A consequence of this disproportionate brain growth appears to be a significantly increased risk of cerebellar tonsillar herniation (descent of the cerebellar tonsils through the [[foramen magnum]] of the skull, resembling a [[Arnold–Chiari malformation|Chiari]] I malformation neuroradiologically) and [[ventriculomegaly]]/[[hydrocephalus]].&lt;ref name="pmid18000912"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Conway RL, Pressman BD, Dobyns WB, Danielpour M, Lee J, Sanchez-Lara PA, etal | title=Neuroimaging findings in macrocephaly-capillary malformation: a longitudinal study of 17 patients. | journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics | year= 2007 | volume= 143A | issue= 24 | pages= 2981–3008 | pmid=18000912 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=clinical.uthscsa.edu/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=18000912 | doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.32040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such cerebellar tonsil herniation may occur in up to 70% of children with M-CM.

The medical literature suggests that there is a risk of [[cardiac arrhythmias]] in early childhood.&lt;ref name="pmid11477607"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Yano S, Watanabe Y | title=Association of arrhythmia and sudden death in macrocephaly-cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita syndrome. | journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics | year= 2001 | volume= 102 | issue= 2 | pages= 149–52 | pmid=11477607 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=clinical.uthscsa.edu/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=11477607 |doi=10.1002/ajmg.1428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kuint-"&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Kuint | first1 = J. | last2 = Globus | first2 = O. | last3 = Ben Simon | first3 = GJ. | last4 = Greenberger | first4 = S. | title = Macrocephaly-capillary malformation presenting with fetal arrhythmia | journal = Pediatr Dermatol | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 384–6 | month =  | year =  2012| doi = 10.1111/j.1525-1470.2011.01677.x | pmid = 22329570 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause for this is unknown.

Like other syndromes associated with disproportionate growth, there appears to be a slightly increased risk of certain types of childhood malignancies in M-CM (such as [[Wilms' tumor]]). However, the precise incidence of these malignancies is unclear.

==Treatment==

There is no cure for this condition. Treatment is supportive and varies depending on how symptoms present and their severity. Some degree of developmental delay is expected in almost all cases of M-CM, so evaluation for early intervention or special education programs is appropriate. Rare cases have been reported with no discernible delay in academic or school abilities.

[[Physical therapy]] and orthopedic bracing can help young children with gross motor development. [[Occupational therapy]] or [[speech therapy]] may also assist with developmental delays. Attention from an orthopedic surgeon may be required for leg length discrepancy due to hemihyperplasia.

Children with hemihyperplasia are thought to have an elevated risk for certain types of cancers. Recently published management guidelines recommend regular abdominal ultrasounds up to age eight to detect [[Wilms' tumor]]. AFP testing to detect liver cancer is not recommended as there have been no reported cases of [[hepatoblastoma]] in M-CM patients.&lt;ref name="Rivière-2012"/&gt;

Congenital abnormalities in the brain and progressive brain overgrowth can result in a variety of neurological problems that may require intervention. These include [[hydrocephalus]], cerebellar tonsillar herniation ([[Arnold–Chiari malformation|Chiari I]]), [[seizures]] and [[syringomyelia]]. These complications are not usually congenital, they develop over time often presenting complications in late infancy or early childhood, though they can become problems even later. Baseline brain and spinal cord MRI imaging with repeat scans at regular intervals is often prescribed to monitor the changes that result from progressive brain overgrowth.

Assessment of cardiac health with [[echocardiogram]] and [[EKG]] may be prescribed and arrhythmias or abnormalities may require surgical treatment.

==Prognosis==

Prognosis varies widely depending on severity of symptoms, degree of intellectual impairment, and associated complications. Because the syndrome is rare and so newly identified, there are no long term studies.
==History ==

This disorder was recognized as a distinct syndrome in 1997 and named macrocephaly-cutis marmorata telangiectasia congenita or M-CMTC.&lt;ref name="pmid9354837"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clayton-Smith J, Kerr B, Brunner H, Tranebjaerg L, Magee A, Hennekam RC, etal | title=Macrocephaly with cutis marmorata, haemangioma and syndactyly--a distinctive overgrowth syndrome. | journal=Clin Dysmorphol | year= 1997 | volume= 6 | issue= 4 | pages= 291–302 | pmid=9354837 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=clinical.uthscsa.edu/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=9354837 | doi=10.1097/00019605-199710000-00001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9129744"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moore CA, Toriello HV, Abuelo DN, Bull MJ, Curry CJ, Hall BD, etal | title=Macrocephaly-cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita: a distinct disorder with developmental delay and connective tissue abnormalities. | journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics | year= 1997 | volume= 70 | issue= 1 | pages= 67–73 | pmid=9129744 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1096-8628(19970502)70:1&lt;67::AID-AJMG13&gt;3.0.CO;2-V| url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=clinical.uthscsa.edu/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=9129744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A new name, macrocephaly-capillary malformation, abbreviated M-CM, was recommended in 2007.&lt;ref name="pmid17963258"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Toriello HV, Mulliken JB | title=Accurately renaming macrocephaly-cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita (M-CMTC) as macrocephaly-capillary malformation (M-CM). | journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics | year= 2007 | volume= 143A | issue= 24 | pages= 3009 | pmid=17963258 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=clinical.uthscsa.edu/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=17963258 | doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.31971 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This new name was chosen to more accurately describe the skin markings associated with this disorder.

[[File:Neby Samat 01 SWP.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Maqam of Nabi Samit in [[Sar'a]]. Destroyed in the 1950s.]]
A '''Maqām''' ({{lang-ar|مقام}}) is a shrine built on the site associated with a [[Muslim]] saint or religious figure, usually his or her tomb. It is a funeral construction, usually small, cubic-shaped and topped with a dome.

The maqams of Palestine were considered highly significant to the field of [[biblical archaeology]], as their names were used in the 18th and 19th centuries to identify much of [[List of biblical places|biblical geography]]. &lt;ref&gt;Conder, 1877, p. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme09pale#page/n98/mode/1up 89]: "...the local sanctuaries scattered over the country, a study which is also of no little importance in relation to the ancient topography of Palestine, as is shown by the various sites which have been recovered by means of the tradition of sacred tombs preserved after the name of the site itself had been lost."&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Claude Reignier Conder]]'s description in 1877, the Palestinian locals attached "more importance to the favour and protection of the village Mukam than to Allah himself, or to Mohammed his prophet".&lt;ref&gt;Conder, 1877, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme09pale#page/n98/mode/1up 89]-90: "In their religious observances and sanctuaries we find, as in their language, the true history of the country. On a basis of polytheistic faith which most probably dates back to pre-Israelite times, we find a growth of the most heterogeneous description: Christian tradition, Moslem history and foreign worship are mingled so as often to be entirely indistinguishable, and the so-called Moslem is found worshipping at shrines consecrated to Jewish, Samaritan, Christian, and often Pagan memories. It is in worship at these shrines that the religion of the peasantry consists. Moslem by profession, they often spend their lives without entering a mosque, and attach more importance to the favour and protection of the village Mukam than to Allah himself, or to Mohammed his prophet... The reverence shown for these sacred spots is unbounded. Every fallen stone from the building, every withered branch of the tree, is carefully preserved. "&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
From Arabic literally "a place" or "station."&lt;ref name=Prochazkap112&gt;{{Harvnb|Prochazka|2010|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to denote a "sanctuary", such as a commemorative burial shrine or an actual tomb.&lt;ref name=Prochazkap112/&gt; Its meaning can be restricted only to built structures that can be entered at such sites.&lt;ref name=Prochazkap112/&gt; The literal meaning of ''maqam'' is "the place where one stands."&lt;ref name=Prochazkap112/&gt; Such name for a holy tomb is mostly used in [[Syria]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. 

There is a form ''Mukam'' in the essays of European travellers of the 19th century; as well as words ''Waly'', ''Wely'' ({{lang-ar|ويلي}} — tomb of a saint), ''[[Mazar (mausoleum)]]'', ''Mashhad''.
 
Due to their cubic shape, these constructions were also called ''Kubbeh'', ''Kubbi'', ''[[Qubba]]'' the same way as the major sacred site [[Kaaba]] in [[Mecca]]. In Turkic-speaking Muslim countries similar tombs are known as [[Türbe]], Dürbe, Aziz and in Iranian-speaking countries — [[Dargah]].

== Construction and purpose ==
The most popular type of maqams is a single chamber square building topped with a dome, in the middle of which there is a stone [[cenotaph]],&lt;ref&gt;McCown, 1921, p. [https://archive.org/stream/jstor-3768451/3768451#page/n4/mode/1up 50]&lt;/ref&gt; though the bodies of holy men themselves were buried below the ground level. In the south wall of the maqam, facing Mecca, there is usually a small [[mihrab]] decorated with inscriptions and floral ornament. The entrance to the chamber is mostly at the north wall. In the other arched walls there are usually small windows.

The dome is often situated by an ancient carob or oak tree or a spring or rock cut water cistern.&lt;ref name=Qleibo&gt;{{cite web|title=Palestinian Cave Dwellers and Holy Shrines: The Passing of Traditional Society|author=Dr. Ali Qleibo|publisher=This Week in Palestine|date=28 July 2007|accessdate=2007-08-17|url=http://www.thisweekinpalestine.com/details.php?id=2208&amp;ed=144&amp;edid=144These}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Karkp260/&gt; The positioning of maqams on or near these nautral features is seen as indicative of ancient worship practices adapted by the local population and associated with Muslim saints.&lt;ref name= bsap99&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=02FtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=maqam+sanctuary&amp;dq=maqam+sanctuary&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vWPiTrHNJY6hOujj7cME&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBzgo]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ali Qleibo]], a Palestinian [[anthropologist]], states that this built evidence constitutes "an architectural testimony to Christian/Moslem Palestinian religious sensibility and its roots in [[ancient Semitic religion]]s."&lt;ref name=Qleibo/&gt;

[[File:Maqam in Samaria Wilson.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Maqam in Northern Palestine (C. Wilson, 1881).]]

Maqams were dedicated to biblical and quranic, real or mythical, male and female figures from ancient times to the time of the Arab conquest or even late Ottoman rule.&lt;ref name=Pappep78/&gt; The maqams are not always supposed to stand over the tombs of the saints to whom they are dedicated. A cenotaph is indeed almost always to be found there, but often they are regarded merely as "stations."
 
There are also bigger maqams, consisting of two, three or four chambers:&lt;ref&gt;Canaan, 1927, p. [http://digital.soas.ac.uk/LOAA003475/00002/60j  47]: "The more important the holy man, the greater the complexity of the building. Prophets (''anbiā'') enjoy the largest maqams."&lt;/ref&gt; prayer chamber, entrance hall, zawiya or a room for pilgrims to have a rest. Big maqams have two or three similar domes. In times of old, the dome was decorated by a metal spire with a crescent, but nowadays such decoration is rare.
 
A sacred tree was planted near maqams, mostly — a palm tree, oak or [[Ficus sycomorus|sycomore]]. There was also a well or spring.
 
Candelabras and lamps are hanging in an active maqam, a cenotaph is covered by a quilt (usually a green one), praying rugs are spread on the floor in front of the mihrab.

{{cquote|bgcolor=#F0F8FF|''It is in worship at these shrines that the religion of the peasantry consists. Moslem by profession, they often spend their lives without entering a mosque, and attach more importance to the favour and protection of the village Мukam than to Allah himself, or to Mohammed his prophet.''&lt;ref&gt;Conder, 1877, p. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme09pale#page/n98/mode/1up 89]&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
As a rule, maqams were built on the top of the hills or at the crossroads, and besides their main function — shrine and prayer place, they also served as a guard point and a guiding landmark for travelers and caravans. Over the years, new burial places appeared near maqams; it was considered as honour to be buried next to a saint. Big cemeteries formed around many Muslim sanctuaries.

Almost every village in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] has a ''[[wali]]'', a patron saint, whom people, predominantly rural peasants, would call upon for help at his or her associated sanctuary.&lt;ref name=Houranip470&gt;{{Harvnb|Hourani|1993|pages=470-471}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ''wali'' can refer to both the saint and sanctuary, a sanctuary for a common saint is more precisely known as a maqam.&lt;ref name=Sharonp142&gt;{{Harvnb|Sharon|1999|page= [https://books.google.com/books?id=EPFDU8POrXIC&amp;pg=PA142  142]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
{{see also|Ziyarat}}
Early Islam disapproved worshipping of holy men and their burial places, considering it a sort of [[idolatry]]. But it was [[Shia Islam|Shiites]] who started to build sumptuous tombs for their deceased leaders — [[imam]]s and [[sheikh]]s, and turned those tombs into religious objects. Very soon [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]] followed their example. Arab travellers and geographers [[Ali ibn abi bakr al-Harawi|‘Ali al-Harawi]], [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] and others described in their essays many Christian and Muslim shrines in Syria, Palestine and Egypt.
 
[[File:Maqam in Judea 1940s.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Maqam in Southern Palestine, 1940s.]]
 
During the times of [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk dynasty]], monumental tombs were built for Muslim holy men, scientists and theologists, some of these tombs have come down to present times. The major part of them is located in Egypt, and some parts are also in Syria and Palestine. These are namely the famous [[Rachel's Tomb]] in [[Bethlehem]] (though the burial place of matriarch [[Rachel]] was worshipped even before), the splendid mausoleum of [[Abu Hurairah]] in [[Yavne]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Simon Clermont-Ganneau]] describes this monument as follows: "At Yebna we pitched our tent near the wely of Abu Horeira. Inside this we noticed numerous fragments of marble, several stones with the medieval tool-marking, and two marble columns surmounted by their capitals. The outside of the building is rather a picturesque sight, with its lewain of three arches, its cupolas and its courtyard planted with fine trees." —Clermont-Ganneau, 1896, Vol. II. pp. [https://archive.org/stream/archaeologicalre02cler#page/167/mode/1up 167–168]&lt;/ref&gt; and the maqam of sheikh Abu ‘Atabi in [[Al-Manshiyya, Acre]]. 
 
In the [[Ottoman Empire]] times, maqams were constructed everywhere, and old sanctuaries were taken under restoration. New buildings were not as monumental and pompous as before, and looked quite unpretentious. In Turkish period, maqams had simple construction and almost no architectural décor. 
 
Mosques were uncommon in Palestinian villages until the late 19th century, but practically every village had at least one maqam which served as sites of worship in the Palestinian folk Islam popular in the countryside over the centuries.&lt;ref name=Houranip470/&gt;&lt;ref name=Karkp260&gt;{{Harvnb|Kark|2001|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians and Jews also held some of the maqams to be holy, such as that of [[Nabi Samwil]].&lt;ref name=Sharonp142/&gt; In the period of Ottoman rule over Palestine, most of these sites were visited collectively by members of all three faiths who often travelled together with provisions for a multi-day journey; by the [[Mandate Palestine]] period, politicization led to segregation.&lt;ref name=Pappep78&gt;{{Harvnb|Pappe|2006|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some maqams, like [[Nabi Rubin]] and [[Nabi Musa]] among others, were also the focus of seasonal festivals (''mawsims'') that thousands would attend annually.

{{cquote|bgcolor=#F0F8FF|''There is, however, in nearly every village, a small whitewashed building with a low dome — the "mukam," or "place," sacred to the eyes of the peasants. In almost every landscape such a landmark gleams from the top of some hill, just as, doubtless, something of the same kind did in the old Canaanite ages.''&lt;ref&gt;Geikie, 1888, vol. I, p. [https://archive.org/stream/holylandbible01geikuoft#page/578/mode/1up  578]&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
 
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 7533 sheikh nuran grave.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Maqam of Sheikh Nuran in the kibbutz [[Magen, Israel|Magen]], converted into a [[Pillbox (military)]].]]
 
The period of [[Mandatory Palestine]] has become the last time of maqams prosperity. Dilapidated Muslims shrines were restored and also new ones built. The British built over and donated to [[Bedouin]]s the Maqam of sheikh Nuran, which was damaged during the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]]. This maqam was in the battle epicenter during the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. After having captured it, Israeli soldiers turned it into a watch and firing point. Since that time the maqam of sheikh Nuran is a memorial of the  [[Israel Defense Forces]].
 
After the State of [[Israel]] was formed, numerous Muslim shrines were privatized by Jewish and turned them into their own religious shrines. It concerned the [[mausoleum of sheikh Abu Hurairah]], it which has become the tomb of Rabban [[Gamaliel II]] in [[Yavne]];&lt;ref&gt;
Breger, M. J., Reiter, Y. and Hammer, L. (2010) ''Holy Places in the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: Confrontation and Co-existence''. London and N.–Y., 2010. pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nROPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA79  79–80.]&lt;/ref&gt; the Maqam with seven domes of Imam ‘Ali in [[Yazur]] has turned into a [[synagogue]] in [[Azor]]; the [[Mazar (mausoleum)|mazar]] of Sitt Sakina (Sukeyna) has become Rachel's tomb, the spouse of [[Rabbi Akiva]] in [[Tiberias]]; the Maqam of sheikh al-Gharbawi — the tomb of [[Mattathias]]; the tomb of Nabi Sheman near the [[:he:מחלף אייל|Junction Eyal]], which has been turned into the tomb of [[Simeon (son of Jacob)]]. The privatization of muslim shrines is still in process.
 
In ancient times, all maqams with the domes were coloured in white.&lt;ref&gt;Conder, 1877, p. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme09pale#page/n99/mode/1up 90]: "The white dome of the Mukam is the most conspicuous object in a Syrian village."&lt;/ref&gt; Recently Palestinian and Israeli Arabs got used to colour the domes of their shrines in green (the colour of Islam). On the territory of Israel battle for one or another shrine resulted in the war of colours, as it was called in press.&lt;ref&gt;
[https://web.archive.org/web/20120215213908/http://www.iaqsa.com/2010/11/ The War of colors on the shrine of Sheikh Simeon (in arabic).]&lt;/ref&gt; While privatizing Muslim shrines, religious Jewish paint the dome in blue or white and install Jewish symbols, and Muslims, when coming back, remove Jewish symbols and paint the dome in green.

== Some famous Palestinian maqams ==
No more than 300 maqams out of 800 existing in Palestine in 1948, came down to present times, half of them are on the territory of [[Israel]], the remainder in the [[Palestinian Authority]]. According to another source, the number of Palestinian maqams left is 184, with only 70 on the Israeli territories.&lt;ref&gt;
Frantzman, S. J. and Bar, D. (2013) [https://www.academia.edu/4792931/Mapping_Muslim_Sacred_Tombs_in_Palestine_During_the_Mandate_PeriodI. ''Mapping Muslim Sacred Tombs in Palestine During the Mandate Period''] // "Levant", 2013, Vol. 45, No 1. P. 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claude Reignier Conder]] identified seven types of Palestinian muqam in 1877:&lt;ref&gt;Conder, 1877, p. [https://archive.org/stream/quarterlystateme09pale#page/n100/mode/1up 91]&lt;/ref&gt;
# Biblical characters: "These are, no doubt, generally the oldest, and can often be traced back to Jewish tradition"
# Christian sites venerated by the Moslem peasantry: "not always distinguishable from the first class, but often traceable to the teaching of the monasteries or to monkish sites"
# Other native heroes or deities: "perhaps sometimes the most ancient sites of all"
# Later and known historic characters
# Saints named from the place where they occur, or having appellations connected with traditions concerning them
# Sacred sites not connected with personal names: "Some of these are of the greatest value"
# Ordinary Moslem names which may be of any date

The [[Norse mythology]], preserved in such ancient [[Iceland]]ic texts as the [[Poetic Edda]], the [[Prose Edda]], and other lays and sagas, was little known outside [[Scandinavia]] until the 19th century. With the widespread publication of Norse myths and legends at this time, references to the Norse gods and heroes spread into European literary culture, especially in Scandinavia, Germany, and Britain. In the later 20th century, references to Norse mythology became common in science fiction and fantasy literature, role-playing games, and eventually other cultural products such as Japanese animation.

==Reintroduction to popular culture==
Antiquaries of the 19th century such as [[George Webbe Dasent]] brought the mythology of Scandinavia back to the popular notice of many people in Germany and England; in both cases, Norse mythology was recognized as the latest surviving form of [[Germanic paganism]]. Germany and England were Christianized far earlier than the Scandinavian countries and much of their own traditions were lost.

In Britain, [[William Morris]] composed poetry such as ''[[The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs|Sigurd the Volsung]]'' on Norse legendary subjects as well as translating Icelandic sagas into English. In Germany, [[Richard Wagner]] borrowed characters and themes from Norse mythology to compose the four operas that make up ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' (''The Ring of the Nibelung''), though he also utilized medieval German sources and Germanized the names of the Norse gods.

==Depictions in modern popular culture==

===Comics===

====American comics====
*In the [[Marvel Universe]], the Norse [[wiktionary:Pantheon|Pantheon]] and related elements play a prominent part, especially [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], who has been one of the longest-running [[superhero]]es for the company and has had a starring role in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'', the movie based on the comic books. Also, [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] (Thor's adopted brother in this version) is one of the most prominent villains in the Marvel Universe, serving as one of the main antagonists in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] franchise.
*[[Odin]], [[Thor]], [[Loki]], and several other beings and places in Norse mythology have recurring roles in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[The Sandman (DC Comics Modern Age)|Sandman]]'' graphic novel series, most notably in the ''[[The Sandman: Season of Mists|Season of Mists]]'' and ''[[The Sandman: The Kindly Ones|The Kindly Ones]]'' stories.
**''[[Lucifer (DC Comics)|Lucifer]]'', being a ''Sandman''-spinoff, continues this trend, having [[Loki]] and [[Sigyn]] appear briefly. [[Bergelmir]], [[Yggdrasil]] and [[Naglfar]] have prominent roles, and [[Fenrir|Fenris]] is a major antagonist.
*The American graphic novel ''Gods of Asgard'' by [[Erik Evensen]] is an adaptation of several of the Norse myths. ''Gods of Asgard'' was awarded a [[List of Xeric grant winners#2007|Xeric grant]] in 2007.
*The comic miniseries ''Hammer of the Gods'' by [[Michael Avon Oeming]] and [[Mark Wheatley]], from Insight Studios Group, 2001, uses the world of the Norse myths as a setting.
*The graphic novel series ''Norse Myths: A Viking Graphic Novel Series'' by [[Louise Simonson]], Michael Dahl, Carl Bowen, Eduardo Garcia, and Tod Smith adapts several of the Norse myths for early readers.

&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbr.com/oeming-nails-norse-myth-in-hammer-of-the-gods/&lt;/ref&gt;

====European comics====
*The [[Denmark|Danish]] comic book series ''[[Valhalla (comic)|Valhalla]]'' is based on the Norse myths.
*The Belgian comic book series ''[[Thorgal]]'' is based on [[Norse mythology]], but also on [[Atlantis|Atlantean]] fantasy and science fiction.

====Manga, anime and manhwa====
*The Norse Pantheon heroes are the main characters of the Japanese manga and anime ''[[Matantei Loki Ragnarok]]'' (loosely translated, ''The Mythical Detective Loki Ragnarok'').
*The manhwa series ''[[Ragnarok (manhwa)|Ragnarok]]'', by Myung-Jin Lee, is based on Norse mythology and the events of Ragnarok, the prophesied fall of the gods.
*''[[Vinland Saga (manga)|Vinland Saga]]'' takes place in Iceland and 11th-century Europe, which makes many references to Norse mythology
*In ''[[History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi]]'', the protagonists fight against a gang organization known as Ragnarok. Each of the Eight Fists were nicknamed after a figure in Norse mythology, including Berserker, Freya, Loki, Thor, Siegfried, Hermit, Valkyrie, and their leader Odin.

*''[[Attack on Titan]]'', also has prominent themes of Norse mythology, including (but not limited to): [[Ymir]], [[Útgarðar|Castle Utgard]], the walls, the Titans, parallels between Norse gods/goddesses and characters, as well as plot lines that seem to mimic events in Norse mythology. The conflict between the Titan shifters and normal humans may be compared to the wars between the Aesir and Vanir. There are other references that are minor as well, such as the can of herring found by Ymir (which contains Norse runes on the label) and the [[Sæhrímnir|giant boar]] killed in the second OVA of the anime.
*''[[Sword Art Online]]'' has characters and story based on Norse mythology.
*''[[High School DxD]]'' has Norse mythical creatures and gods in the [[light novel]] and anime.

===Literature===
&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD WRITERS ONLY IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER OF PUBLICATION, BY DATE --&gt;
*Stephanie Edgley of the ''[[Skulduggery Pleasant]]'' novel series took up the name Valkyrie Cain, based on the creature the Valkeryie.
*The Victorian adventure writer [[H. Rider Haggard]] wrote an epic adventure in the style of the Nordic sagas, ''[[Eric Brighteyes]]'' (1890).
*Various Norse gods are referenced in the book ''[[The Ballad of the White Horse]]'' (1911) by [[G. K. Chesterton]]. [[Odin]] and [[Thor]] are portrayed there in a negative light. The ballad portrays [[Catholicism]] as the true religion and the Norse religion as pagan.
*In the novel, ''[[The Incomplete Enchanter]]'' (1941) by [[L. Sprague de Camp]] and Fletcher Pratt, the protagonist finds himself in Asgard, where he allies himself with the [[Æsir]] as Ragnarök approaches.
*''[[The Broken Sword]]'' (1954) by [[Poul Anderson]] is inspired by Norse sagas, and feature numerous Norse gods, elves and trolls as characters. Later, in ''The Sorrow of Odin the Goth'', part of his ''Time Patrol'' series, Anderson suggested that Odin was originally a 20th-century American [[time travel]]er who visited several generations of early the wandering [[Goths]] ‒ who started to regard him as a god, later influencing other Germanic peoples.
*''The Day of the Giants'' (1959) by [[Lester del Rey]] tells the tale of [[Ragnarok]] happening in a near future science fiction setting, with an erstwhile engineer arming the Norse Gods with modern weaponry.
*The Argentinian writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]] have mentioned various Norse gods along his life work, as he did in the short story [[:es:Ulrica|Ulrica]] and the poem titled A wolf (Un Lobo). Also, he was buried in Geneva and his gravestone has inscriptions written in old English and Old Norse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7355">'''Palatability''' is the [[Reward system|hedonic reward]] (i.e., [[pleasure]]) provided by foods or fluids that are agreeable to the "[[palate]]", which often varies relative to the [[homeostatic]] satisfaction of [[nutrition|nutritional]], [[Fluid_balance|water]], or [[Food_energy|energy]] needs.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman MI, Stricker EM. (1976). The physiological psychology of hunger: a physiological perspective. Psychol Rev. 83(6):409-31. {{PMID|1005583}}&lt;/ref&gt; The palatability of a food or fluid, unlike its [[flavor]] or [[taste]], varies with the state of an individual: it is lower after [[eating|consumption]] and higher when [[hunger|deprived]]. It has increasingly been appreciated that this can create a hunger that is independent of homeostatic needs.&lt;ref name="Lowe"&gt;Lowe MR, Butryn ML. (2007). Hedonic hunger: a new dimension of appetite? Physiol Behav. Jul 24;91(4):432-9. {{PMID|17531274}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Brain mechanism==
[[File:Scott &amp; Bowne's Palatable Castor Oil.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Advertisement of [[Castor oil]] as a medicine by Scott &amp; Bowne company, 19th century]]
The palatability of a substance is determined by [[opioid receptor]]-related processes in the [[nucleus accumbens]] and ventral [[pallidum]].&lt;ref name="Wassum"&gt;Wassum KM, Ostlund SB, Maidment NT, Balleine BW. (2009). Distinct opioid circuits determine the palatability and the desirability of rewarding events. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.  106:12512–12517 {{PMID|19597155}} {{doi|10.1073/pnas.0905874106}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opioid processes involve [[mu opioid receptor]]s and are present in the rostromedial shell part of the nucleus accumbens&lt;ref&gt;Peciña S, Berridge KC. (2005). [http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/full/25/50/11777 Hedonic hot spot in nucleus accumbens shell: where do mu-opioids cause increased hedonic impact of sweetness?] J Neurosci. 14;25(50):11777-86. {{DOI|10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2329-05.2005}} {{PMID|16354936}} &lt;/ref&gt;  on its [[Medium_spiny_neuron|spiny neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Kelley AE, Bakshi VP, Haber SN, Steininger TL, Will MJ, Zhang M. (2002). Opioid modulation of taste hedonics within the ventral striatum. Physiol Behav. 76(3):365-77. {{PMID|12117573}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area has been called the "opioid eating site".&lt;ref&gt;Peciña S, Berridge KC. (2000).Opioid site in nucleus accumbens shell mediates eating and hedonic 'liking' for food: map based on microinjection Fos plumes. Brain Res. 863(1-2):71-86. {{PMID|10773195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rewardfulness of consumption associated with palatability is dissociable from desire or incentive value which is the motivation to seek out a specific commodity.&lt;ref name="Wassum"/&gt; Desire or incentive value is processed by [[opioid receptor]]-related processes in the [[basolateral amygdala]].&lt;ref name="Wassum"/&gt; Unlike the liking palatability for food, the [[incentive salience]] wanting is not downregulated by the physiological consequences of food consumption and may be largely independent of homoeostatic processes influencing food intake.&lt;ref&gt;Finlayson G, King N, Blundell J. (2008).  The role of implicit wanting in relation to explicit liking and wanting for food: implications for appetite control. Appetite. 50(1):120-7. {{PMID|17655972}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Though the wanting of incentive salience may be informed by palatability it is independent and not necessarily reduced to it.&lt;ref name="Wassum"/&gt; It has been suggested that a third system exists that links opioid processes in the two parts of the brain: "Logically this raises the possibility that a third system, with which the accumbens shell, ventral pallidum, and basolateral amygdala are associated, distributes the affective signals elicited by specific commodities across distinct functional systems to control reward seeking... At present we do not have any direct evidence for a system of this kind, but indirect evidence suggests it may reside within the motivationally rich circuits linking hypothalamic and brainstem viscerogenic structures such as the parabrachial nucleus.&lt;ref name="Wassum"/&gt;

It has also been suggested that "hedonic hunger" can be driven both in regard to “wanting” and “liking”&lt;ref name="Lowe"/&gt; and that a palatability subtype of neuron may also exist in the basolateral amygdala.&lt;ref&gt;Fontanini A, Grossman SE, Figueroa JA, Katz DB. (2009). Distinct subtypes of basolateral amygdala taste neurons reflect palatability and reward. J Neurosci. 29(8):2486-95. {{PMID|19244523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satiety and palatability==

[[Appetite]] is controlled by a direct loop and an indirect one. In both the direct and indirect loops there are two feedback mechanisms. First a positive feedback involving its stimulation by palatability food cues, and second, a negative feedback due to satiation and satiety cues following ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;Smith GP. (2000).  The controls of eating: a shift from nutritional homeostasis to behavioral neuroscience. Nutrition. 16(10):814-20. {{PMID|11054585}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the indirect loop these cues are learnt by association such as meal plate size and work by modulating the potency of the cues of the direct loop.&lt;ref&gt;Smith GP. (1996). The direct and indirect controls of meal size. Neurosci Biobehav Rev. 20(1):41-6. {{PMID|8622828}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of these processes can exist without subjective awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Berridge KC. (1996). Food reward: brain substrates of wanting and liking. Neurosci Biobehav Rev. ;20(1):1-25. {{PMID|8622814}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The cessation of a desire to eat after a meal "satiation" is likely to be due to different processes and cues.&lt;ref&gt;Blundell JE.  Rogers PJ. (1991). Hunger, hedonics, and the control of satiation and satiety. pp. 127–148. In: M.I. Friedman, M.G. Tordoff and M.R. Kare, (Editors) Appetite and nutrition, Dekker, New York {{ISBN|978-0-8247-8371-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; More palatable foods reduce the effects of  such cues upon satiation causing a larger food intake.&lt;ref&gt;Yeomans MR, Lee MD, Gray RW, French SJ. (2001). [http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v25/n8/pdf/0801653a.pdf Effects of test-meal palatability on compensatory eating following disguised fat and carbohydrate preloads.] Int J Obes Relat Metab Disord. 25(8):1215-24. {{PMID|11477507}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson TM, Gray RW, Yeomans MR, French SJ. (2005).Test-meal palatability alters the effects of intragastric fat but not carbohydrate preloads on intake and rated appetite in healthy volunteers. Physiol Behav. 84(2):193-203. {{PMID|15708771}} &lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, unpalatability of certain foods can serve as a deterrent from feeding on those foods in the future. For example, the [[Euphydryas chalcedona|Variable Checkerspot butterfly]] contains [[iridoid]] compounds that are unpalatable to avian predators, thus reducing the risk of [[predation]].&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, M. D. "Unpalatability as a Defense Strategy of Western Checkerspot Butterflies (Euphydryas Scudder, Nymphalidae)." Evolution 35.2 (1981): 367-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6115">A '''personalized book''' is a [[book]] that is created specifically for someone, containing personalized text, customized illustrations, or variables, based on the characteristics of that person. Personalized books have long been popular gifts for children, where adults feel they are giving something unique to the child. With technology advances personalised books can be customized, ordered, printed and shipped within a week. Although most personalized book companies provide hard copy physical books only, there are a few companies who also offer some or all of their titles in downloadable soft copy.

== Types of Personalization ==

===Text Variables===
All personalized books offer text variables – that is, the purchaser can customize the text of the book (such as the hero's name). The majority of personalized book companies offer this as the only variable, as it is the easiest and fastest element for the producer to customize. Create a book was one of the first companies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.createabook.com/about|title=Create-a-Book: About Us|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to do this on a large scale, founded in 1981 by John Hefty.  He patented a binding machine that made it quick and easy to bind pre printed illustrations with personalized text pages. Illustrations are created and sold in bulk, while the distributors print the personalized text pages and then bind them in with the pictures.

===Illustration Variables===
This approach allows the purchaser to not only customize the text, but the illustrated hero’s unique features and colorings as well.  In the case of Penwizard&lt;ref name="penwizard.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.penwizard.com/uk/|title=Penwizard Personalised Books|website=Penwizard|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210201656/https://www.penwizard.com/uk/|archivedate=2015-12-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and CreateMeBooks&lt;ref name="createmebooks.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.createmebooks.com/|title=CreateMeBooks Personalised Books|website=CreateMeBooks}}&lt;/ref&gt;, character-creator software is incorporated into the website that allows the user to customize an avatar of their child by selecting between many different variables – name, skin tone, hair colour, eye colour, etc. That avatar is then populated into the book illustrations as the star of the story, and their name is written into the story. Penwizard&lt;ref name="penwizard.com"/&gt; offers a wide range of titles such as ''[[Peppa Pig]]'', ''[[Ben &amp; Holly's Little Kingdom]]'' and ''[[In The Night Garden]]''. These books are printed on demand, as every one is unique.

===Story Variables===
The newest form of personalized books are those where the story changes based upon the information inputted by a user. United Kingdom based personalized books publisher, ''[[Lost My Name]]'',&lt;ref name="lostmy.name"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lostmy.name|title=Personalised Children's Books - Personalised Story Books - Wonderbly|website=www.lostmy.name}}&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the first to innovate children's books in this way. In their first publication, ''The Little Boy Or Girl Who Lost Their Name'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lostmy.name/personalized-products/lost-my-name-book|title=The Little Boy Or Girl Who Lost Their Name - Wonderbly|website=www.lostmy.name}}&lt;/ref&gt; the customer is able to adapt which characters the child meets based upon the child's name. For example, if a boy is called Lee, the first part of the story could be based around the child meeting a Lion or a Lobster.

Since launching their first book, ''Lost My Name''&lt;ref name="lostmy.name"/&gt; have gone on to launch a book based upon a child's home, ''The Incredible Intergalactic Journey Home'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lostmy.name/personalized-products/the-journey-home-book|title=The Incredible Intergalactic Journey Home - Kids Space Book|website=www.lostmy.name}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a book based upon a child's favorite things,  ''Kingdom of You''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lostmy.name/personalized-products/kingdom-of-you-book|title=Kingdom of You - Wonderbly|website=www.lostmy.name}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photo Insertion/Photo Adaption===
Another, more complex type of personalization incorporates photo insertion/manipulation.  A user-submitted photo of the “hero” is uploaded and inserted into the illustrations of the book, such as Pixel Pole,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pixelpole.com|title=Pixel Pole - Photo Art|first=|last=PixelPole@yahoo.com|website=www.pixelpole.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; MyFairyTaleBooks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.myfairytalebooks.com|title=Personalized Children's Books &amp; Gifts for Kids - MyFairyTaleBooks|website=www.myfairytalebooks.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kid Hero Stories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kidherostories.com|title=KID HERO STORIES- Personalized Children’s Books with Their Photo|website=Kid Hero Stories}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shutterfly]], and Identity Direct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.identitydirect.com|title=Personalized Books from Identity Direct|website=www.identitydirect.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike text only personalized [[illustration]] books, no pages of these books can be mass produced as each illustration is unique.

== Personalized eBooks ==
With the rise in popular use of tablets and smartphones, a few personalized book providers are beginning to offer some or all of their titles in electronic format (eBooks). Benefits of eBooks are lower book costs and faster production / turn around time. Little Heroes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littleheroes.com|title=Very cute personalized kids books from Little Heroes|website=Little Heroes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[KD Novelties]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kdnovelties.com|title=Personalized Children's Books &amp; Kid's Gifts - KD Novelties|website=www.kdnovelties.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Zoowun Books]]&lt;ref&gt;http://zoowun.com&lt;/ref&gt; all offer a range of titles with text variables. Kid Hero Stories uniquely offers a personalized book service, where customers receive a new [[eBook]] story every week, (incorporating text variables and photo insertion).

The '''''Pesaro Madonna''''' ({{lang-it|Pala Pesaro}}) (better known as the Madonna di Ca' Pesaro) is a painting by the late Italian Renaissance master [[Titian]], commissioned by Jacopo Pesaro, whose family acquired in 1518 the chapel in the [[Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari|Frari]] Basilica in [[Venice]] for which the work was painted, and where it remains today.  Jacopo was Bishop of [[Paphos]], in [[Cyprus]], and had been named commander of the papal fleet by the [[Borgia]] pope, [[Alexander VI]].&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt; This painting recalls one of Titian's earliest paintings ''[[Jacopo Pesaro being presented by Pope Alexander VI to Saint Peter]]'', c. 1510-11&lt;ref name="smart1"&gt;{{cite web | title =Titian's Madonna of the Pesaro Family | work = | publisher =[[Smarthistory]] at [[Khan Academy]] | date = | url =http://smarthistory.khanacademy.org/titian-madonna-of-the-pesaro-family.html | accessdate =March 11, 2013 }}, text.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics==
Titian shows his patron in a devotional pose, kneeling before the Virgin and presented to her by [[Saint Peter]].  Prominently displayed on the step is Saint Peter's key; its diagonal plane, leading toward the Virgin, parallels that of Jacopo.  The Virgin's position at the top of the steps alludes to her celestial role as ''Madonna della Scala ''(Madonna of the Stairs) and as the Stairway to Heaven. Titian actually used his wife, who died in childbirth soon after, as the model for the Virgin Mary in this work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-destinations.com/italy/venice-santa-maria-gloriosa-dei-frari Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, Venice], accessed March 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The large red banner at the far left prominently displays the papal arms in the center and those of Jacopo below. Also displayed is a laurel branch, a symbol of victory.  An unidentified knight has two prisoners in tow, a turbaned [[Turkish people|Turk]] and a [[Moors|Moor]], probably a reference to Jacopo's victory over the Turks in 1502.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt;  At the right, [[Saint Francis of Assisi]] links the five kneeling Pesaro family members to Christ, suggesting that through his own route of identification with Christ salvation can be achieved.  Just behind Saint Francis is [[Saint Anthony of Padua]] - both, like [[Saint Bernardino]], are Franciscans, as is the church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari.

The members of the donor's family are motionless.  All the other figures gesture energetically and occupy diagonal planes.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt;  The steps, surmounted by large columns cut off at the top, are thrust diagonally back into space.  Infant angels appear on the cloud above.  One seen in rear view holds the Cross.  The back of this angel is juxtaposed with the infant Christ, who turns playfully on Mary's lap and looks down at Saint Francis, who returns his gaze.  The fabrics are characteristically rich and textured, particularly the flag and costumes.  This attention to material textures is further enhanced by the variation of bright lights and dark accents in the sky.  The light of Venice, sparkling in its waterways, seems to illuminate this painting.

==Composition==

When Titian painted this [[altarpiece]], he broke with a centuries-long tradition of placing the devotional figures (the Virgin and Child) in the center of the painting and the painted space. By doing this, he allowed for a greater sense of movement through the painting, presaging the Baroque period's more complicated compositional techniques.
The painting is particularly innovative and shows an example of developed High-Renaissance style, as Titian has used diagonal and triangular principles to draw the viewer's eye up to the Madonna and Child, thus creating hierarchy within the work and shows that the Pesaro family are pious.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt; 

The architectural setting, involving the two large columns (which have been cropped to fit the altarpiece) draw emphasis vertically and to the height of the work; which draws the eye Heavenwards. These columns in the center of the painting are unprecedented in Renaissance painting, and are the subject of some controversy. X-rays reveal that Titian painted several other architectural elements in their place before settling on the columns.  Some critics have even speculated that Titian did not paint the columns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://venice.umwblogs.org/exhibit/titians-altarpieces-color-innovation-and-invention/assumption/ Titian: Madonna di Ca’ Pesaro], Venice an online exhibit, the University of Mary Washington. Accessed March 11, 2013 &lt;/ref&gt;  The outdoors setting suggests that the activity is taking place in a portico, in which the grandeur of the columns somehow belittles the human beings which leave the figures and the viewer almost in awe of the greater implied force.

'''Size zero''' or '''size 0''' is a [[dress size|women's clothing size]] in the [[US catalog sizes]] system. Size 0 and 00 were invented due to the changing of clothing sizes over time (referred to as [[vanity sizing]] or size inflation), which has caused the adoption of lower numbers. For example, a 2011 size 0 is equivalent to a 2001 size 2, and is larger than a 1970 size 6 or 1958 size 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gsi.nist.gov/global/docs/vps/csfiles/cs_215-58.pdf |title=Body Measurements for the Sizing of Women's Patterns and Apparel |date=1958 |format=PDF |access-date=2017-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044355/http://gsi.nist.gov/global/docs/vps/csfiles/cs_215-58.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gsi.nist.gov/global/docs/stds/womens-ps42-70.pdf |title=Body Measurements for the Sizing of Women's Patterns and Apparel |date=1970 |format=PDF |access-date=2017-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307190354/http://gsi.nist.gov/global/docs/stds/womens-ps42-70.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern size 0 clothing, depending on brand and style, fits measurements of chest-stomach-hips from 30-22-32&amp;nbsp;inches (76-56-81&amp;nbsp;cm) to 36-28-36&amp;nbsp;inches (90-71½-90&amp;nbsp;cm).

== Criticism ==
[[File:Katie Green, Focus on Imaging 2010.jpg|thumb|right|Katie Green, who initiated a campaign against size zero modeling]]
The use of size 0 in advertisements and products of the clothing industry has been met with some media attention. In July 2009, [[Katie Green]] won a competition to represent [[Wonderbra]]. They referred her to the Premier Model Management agency for representation. Green reported that "one of the guys from the PR agency from Wonderbra" insisted that she lose weight, that it wasn't normal for models to be a (UK) size 8. "Unless I could drop down to that weight, they wouldn't be willing to get me more work."&lt;ref name=interview1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.femininebeauty.info/video/katie.green.1.flv |format=Flash video |title=They said I was too fat, says Wonderbra sensation Katie Green |publisher=News of the World|accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green at first complied, but then quit the agency.

They set a goal to obtain 20,000 signatures and plan to present it to the UK Prime Minister and Parliament. They are campaigning for legislation that would require regular health checkups for all models before undertaking any assignments.&lt;ref name=snape2009&gt;{{cite news|author=Snape, Katie|date=9 August 2009|url=http://blogs.news.sky.com/boultonandco/Post:2d01317d-fa71-4e4c-9154-045a21b57538|title=Today's Sunday Live|publisher=skynews.com|accessdate=10 August 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812143348/http://blogs.news.sky.com/boultonandco/Post:2d01317d-fa71-4e4c-9154-045a21b57538|archivedate=12 August 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movement against size zero ==
[[File:Victoria_Beckham_2010.jpg|thumb|right|Victoria Beckham, in 2010]]

After the death of [[Luisel Ramos]] from anorexia in August, 2006, Madrid Fashion Week banned size zero models the following month, and the Milan fashion show took the same action shortly afterward, banning models with a [[body mass index|body mass index (BMI)]] of 18 or below. As a result, five models were banned from taking part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2006/11/skeletons-on-the-runway-the-size-zero-debate |title=Skeletons on the Runway: The "Size-Zero Debate" &amp;#124; Britannica Blog |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304062710/http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2006/11/skeletons-on-the-runway-the-size-zero-debate |archivedate=March 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, the British Fashion Council promoted the creation of a task force to establish guidelines for the fashion industry. They also urged fashion designers to use healthy models.

Italian fashion labels [[Prada]], [[Versace]] and [[Armani]] have agreed to ban size zero models from their catwalks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metro.co.uk/2006/12/10/prada-joins-versace-to-ban-size-zero-models-446088/ ''Metro'']&lt;/ref&gt; Under the new self-regulation code drawn up in Italy by the government and designers, all models in future shows will be "full-bodied", and larger sizes will be introduced at shows.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/italy-bans-too-thin-models/ CBS News]&lt;/ref&gt; Fashion designer [[Giorgio Armani]] has given support to the effort to eliminate ultra-thin models. "The time has now come for clarity. We all need to work together against [[anorexia nervosa|anorexia]]."

[[Israel]] banned underweight models in March 2012. Their law stipulates that women and men hired as models must be certified by a physician as having a [[body mass index|body mass index (BMI)]] of no less than 18.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ibtimes.com/israel-passes-law-to-ban-underweight-models/4251.html |title=Israel Passes Law to Ban Underweight Models |first=Sally |last=Turner | date= Mar 20, 2012 |accessdate=March 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation also requires the inclusion of an informational note in adverts using photos manipulated to make models look thinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel bans use of ultra-skinny models|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/20/israel-models-law-idUSL6E8EJ3IT20120320|newspaper=Reuters|date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were divergent views on the ban within the Israeli fashion industry. One modelling agent, who had helped promote the bill, suggested that the fall in typical dress sizes for models in the preceding 15–20 years amounted to "the difference between death and life". However, another described the law as "arbitrary" and "not appropriate for every model".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Israel passes law banning use of underweight models|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17450275|newspaper=BBC News|date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4746">'''Symphony No. 1 in B-flat major''' was the first [[symphony]] composed by [[Charles Villiers Stanford]]. It was written in 1876 to compete for a prize offered by the proprietors of the [[Alexandra Palace]]. It came second out of 46 entries earning a prize of £5.&lt;ref&gt;Schaarwächter, Jürgen (2015). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EIvoCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196 ''Two Centuries of British Symphonism: From the beginnings to 1945''], pp. 196; 213–215. Georg Olms Verlag. {{ISBN|3487152274}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symphony was dedicated to the tenor [[Arthur Duke Coleridge]] who had been a friend of Stanford's at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. It was first played at [[The Crystal Palace]] in London in 1879 but was never published or performed again in Stanford's lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;Keebaugh, Aaron C. (2004).

[[Naxos Records|Naxos]]&lt;/ref&gt;  

According to Stanford's biographer, Jeremy Dibble, the work shows influences from [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 3 (Schumann)|Rhenish Symphony]]'', not only in the [[Ländler]] trios of the second movement but also in Stanford's effective use of "quasi-archaic" passages in the first and last movements to convey a sense of solemn intensity.&lt;ref&gt;Dibble, Jeremy (2002). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VevXghb1SwoC&amp;pg=PA78 ''Charles Villiers Stanford: Man and Musician''], pp. 78–79. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0198163835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movements==
I. Larghetto – Allegro vivace

II. Scherzo: [[Ländler]] tempo  (Trio 1: Presto, Trio 2: Poco più lento)

III. Andante tranquillo 

IV. Finale: Allegro molto 
&lt;!--  The following material is commented out pending a third party source. At the moment it is too subjective:
The first movement is prefaced by an extended brooding introduction whose opening idea is later transformed into its second subject. With a change of tempo the first subject appears on the clarinets, and the movement leaps into life. Several passages are founded on the theme, before the arrival of the second subject;these ideas then form the basis of various episodes until Stanford recapitulates the first subject dramatically on trombones over a fortissimo chord of B flat across the whole orchestra, and the second subject now reappears as a cello solo. The coda is triumphant, the trumpets fan faring the principal themes in augmentation.

The second movement looks back to Beethoven and Schubert in its adoption of a handler rhythm, pointed up by two contrasted trios. The slow movement is hushed, the violins and cholas playing muted throughout, and the second idea, floated on the horns, brings us the mature Stanford's authentic fingerprints, with its flavour of Irish folksong foreshadowing many such horn themes. Surely, too, the use of a solo violin towards the end looks forward to similar usage in later symphonies by many British composers.

The finale with its driving repeated notes perhaps gave Stanford his greatest test. Yet its impetus and energy shows we are in authentic Stanford territory, as do the arrival of the second subject and an episode on the brass, which both in treatment and turn of phrase foreshadow his mature style. The development is crowned by a vigorous fugal based in the first subject, and the workings with the brass episode played by the trombones in imitation, as Stanford builds up the excitement with a chromatically rising bass and ends with a youthful exhibition of high spirits.--&gt;

[[File:The Envoys of Agamemnon by Ingres.jpg|thumb|250px]]
'''''The Ambassadors of Agamemnon in the tent of Achilles''''' is an 1801 painting by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], produced for the [[Prix de Rome]] competition. It is now in the [[École nationale supérieure des beaux-arts]] in [[Paris]].

It shows an episode from Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', in which [[Achilles]] refuses to listen to the envoys sent by [[Agamemnon]] to convince him back into the [[Trojan War]]. The topic assigned for the artists competing for the Prix de Rome in 1801 was the warriors' procession toward battle; Ingres' interpretation of the subject characteristically emphasized a moment of psychological drama instead of physical action.&lt;ref&gt;Condon et al. 1983, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was intended as a demonstration of Ingres' mastery of the human figure in classical history painting – [[Odysseus]] is shown in a red cloak derived from a sculpture by Pseudo-Phidias. 

The painting is in the neo-classical style and belongs to the school of [[Jacques-Louis David]], in whose studio Ingres had trained. It also shows new influences from [[John Flaxman]], whose work had just had its first [[Paris]]ian exhibition.&lt;ref name="Adams2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Arron Adams|title=Ingres: His Palette|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g1D_CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT5|date=18 April 2016|publisher=Arron Adams|isbn=978-605-04-2285-6|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Ant Bully''''' ({{ISBN|0590395912}}) is a 1999 [[children's book]] drawn and written by [[John Nickle]]. It is about a young boy named Lucas Nickle (also known as Peanut the Destroyer), who is the [[title character]] in the book and who likes to torment [[ant]]s. It was later adapted into a [[The Ant Bully (film)|computer-animated film of the same name]] by [[John A. Davis]], produced by [[Legendary Pictures]] and [[DNA Productions]] for [[Warner Bros. Pictures]].

==Story==
Lucas is a boy who is perceived as "strange" by his peers due to his funny glasses and propeller beanie (hat). Sid, the neighborhood bully, continuously bullies Lucas by spraying him with a water hose and stealing his hat. In an attempt to cope with Sid's actions, Lucas projects his anger onto a local colony of ants by spraying them with water, just as Sid has done to him.

The ants have enough and tackle and shove Lucas into the queen's chamber, and the queen confronts him about all of the trouble he has caused the colony. When Lucas is too shocked to even respond to her, the queen takes it as an insult, and orders an ant wizard to shrink the boy down to the size of an ant and take him to trial, where the judge declares him guilty. His punishment is to work hard like an ant, working in the field, gathering food, defending the colony from wasps and spiders, and taking care of the queen, the worst part of his punishment.

After a while, the queen tells Lucas that he has one last test to be set free: he must go home and bring her a Red Sweet Rock (jelly bean). Lucas brings two ants with him on the journey, and they ask him what it's like being a giant. Lucas tells them that he isn't a giant and gets picked on by Sid, who does all the same things Lucas does to the ants. When they reach his house, they find a box of swell jells, but Lucas's father sees the ants and tries to smash them with a fly swatter. Lucas shouts at his dad to stop, helping the ants to escape. Meanwhile, the queen is upset, fearing that Lucas was killed, but to her surprise he returns, and as promised she gives him the potion to return him to his right size. Lucas falls asleep and wakes up to see Sid, only to his surprise the ants got to him first and shrunk him as revenge.

[[File:Illustration for 'The Dead' in The Year's at the Spring.jpg|thumb|"Honour has come back, as a king, to earth," illustration by [[Harry Clarke]] in ''The Year's at the Spring'', 1920.]]
'''The Dead''' is the name of two poems by [[Rupert Brooke]], parts III and IV of his collection ''[[1914 (poems)|1914]]''.

== 1914 ==
Brooke wrote the five poems that were published in 1914 in the autumn after the outbreak of the [[First World War]] when he enlisted in the [[Royal Naval Division]]. Also in this collection is '[[The Soldier (poem)|The Soldier]]', one of Brooke's most famous poems, though 'The Dead' (IV) was one of his personal favourites. The poems were published in New Numbers before being published in 1914. Brooke published five poems for this collection: I: 'Peace', II: 'Safety', III: 'The Dead', IV: 'The Dead', V: 'The Soldier'.

==III: The Dead==

''Blow out, you bugles, over the rich Dead!''&lt;br /&gt;
''There's none of these so lonely and poor of old,''&lt;br /&gt;
''But, dying, has made us rarer gifts than gold.''&lt;br /&gt;
''These laid the world away; poured out the red''&lt;br /&gt;
''Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be''&lt;br /&gt;
''Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene,''&lt;br /&gt;
''That men call age; and those who would have been.''&lt;br /&gt;
''Their sons, they gave, their immortality.''

''Blow, bugles, blow! They brought us, for our dearth.''&lt;br /&gt;
''Holiness, lacked so long, and Love, and Pain.''&lt;br /&gt;
''Honour has come back, as a king, to earth,''&lt;br /&gt;
''And paid his subjects with a royal wage;''&lt;br /&gt;
''And Nobleness walks in our ways again;''&lt;br /&gt;
''And we have come into our heritage.''

==IV: The Dead==

''These hearts were woven of human joys and cares,''&lt;br /&gt;
''Washed marvellously with sorrow, swift to mirth.''&lt;br /&gt;
''The years had given them kindness. Dawn was theirs,''&lt;br /&gt;
''And sunset, and the colours of the earth.''&lt;br /&gt;
''These had seen movement, and heard music; known''&lt;br /&gt;
''Slumber and waking; loved; gone proudly friended;''&lt;br /&gt;
''Felt the quick stir of wonder; sat alone;''&lt;br /&gt;
''Touched flowers and furs and cheeks. All this is ended.''

''There are waters blown by changing winds to laughter''&lt;br /&gt;
''And lit by the rich skies, all day. And after,''&lt;br /&gt;
''Frost, with a gesture, stays the waves that dance''&lt;br /&gt;
''And wandering loveliness. He leaves a white''&lt;br /&gt;
''Unbroken glory, a gathered radiance,''&lt;br /&gt;
''A width, a shining peace, under the night.''

==Usage==

== Content ==
In 1933, eight young female friends graduate from [[Vassar College]].  The book describes these women's lives post-graduation, beginning with the marriage of one of the friends, Kay Strong, and ending with her funeral in 1940.  Each character struggles with different issues, including sexism in the work place, child-rearing, financial difficulties, family crises, and sexual relationships.  Nearly all the women's issues involve the men in their lives: fathers, employers, lovers, or husbands.  As highly educated women from affluent backgrounds, they must strive for autonomy and independence in a time when a woman's role is still largely restricted to marriage and childbirth.  The plot is influenced by the political and economic atmosphere of the time. Over the course of the book, the reader learns about the women's views on contraception, love, sex, socialism, and psychoanalysis.

== Characters ==
'''Kay Strong''':  Marries Harald Petersen, who is involved in theater management and stage directing.  Kay calls him a "Yale man", even though he did only graduate work there; this mildly offends the analytical Lakey.  Harald writes plays that are not produced and is frequently unemployed.  Kay has "a ruthless hatred of poor people", and is frustrated by their financial situation.  She supports them by working at Macy's and cares greatly about her material surroundings.  Her husband has multiple extramarital affairs.  Their fights and his drinking escalate; finally he hits her until she threatens him with a bread knife.  The next morning, he commits her to a psychiatric hospital, where Polly is working as a nurse.  Kay is later released from the hospital; she divorces Harald.  Her death at the end of the book is mysterious; no one knows whether she fell from the window on the twentieth floor of the Vassar Club, while airplane spotting, or whether she jumped.  Her friends reunite at the end of the novel at her funeral, where they shun Harald.

'''Mary Prothero, "Pokey"''':  The wealthiest of the Group.  Described as a "fat, cheerful New York society girl", "very rich and lazy".  Pokey says she made it through Vassar only with the help of Priss, a [[Phi Beta Kappa]].  Pokey's father gives her a plane so she is able to commute to Cornell Agricultural School; her mother, upon learning that Harald was arrested at a labor demonstration, is devastated that a "jailbird" once dined at the Prothero home.  Pokey eventually marries.  Her family has an earnest, eccentric, and observant butler named Hatton, who comes to Kay's funeral.

'''Dottie Renfrew''':  From a Boston family, she aims to be a welfare worker after Vassar. She goes home from Kay's wedding with Dick Brown, a poor artist, and he proceeds to take her virginity. He treats her abruptly and warns her not to fall in love with him. He tells her things can be a lot better between them (sexually) if she would go see a "lady doctor" (so that he wouldn't have to use withdrawal, which he did use in this instance, or condoms). He explains that he prefers diaphragms for upper-class women and condoms for lower-class women. She is fitted for a [[Diaphragm (contraceptive)|diaphragm]] by a woman doctor who is willing to fit unmarried as well as married women.  Dick has not called her or returned her calls. She returns to Dick's apartment, but he is gone.  She waits for him for hours in Washington Square Park; eventually she hides the birth control kit under a bench and goes back to Boston.  Dottie eventually marries Brook Latham from Arizona. Before the wedding, she admits to her perceptive mother that she has slept with Dick and is still in love with him. Her mother suggests she postpone the wedding and see Dick to explore her feelings, but Dottie refuses and marries Brook on schedule.

'''Elinor Eastlake, "Lakey”''':  From Lake Forest, Illinois.  After Pokey, she is the wealthiest of the group; she is cool and aristocratic, a "dark beauty", with pale skin, black hair, and large green eyes.  She spends most of the book in Europe, where she goes to study art history and get a doctorate.  At the end of the book, she returns to America, having fled the war in Europe.  The Group assembles at the pier to greet her arrival, where they find Lakey accompanied by the Baroness, who, it transpires, is her lesbian lover.  The group notes that the Baroness is not terribly bright; they are conflicted over Lakey's sexual orientation.

'''Polly Andrews''':  Her family suffers financial losses due to the Depression.  She is pretty, with "almost flaxen hair", "milk-white skin” and "big blue eyes".  She lives in a building where most of her neighbors are socialists, and she works as a technician in a local hospital.  She has an affair with Gus LeRoy, a married publisher, who is going through [[psychoanalysis]] at the request of his wife.  Polly does not understand why he needs analysis, and after reading Freud, she decides that she herself needs analysis.  Gus eventually leaves Polly and goes back to his wife.  Polly's father, who has just gotten divorced from Polly's mother and suffers from [[bipolar disorder]], comes to live with Polly.  Her father converts to [[Trotskyism]].  In the manic phase of his disorder, he overspends their budget, forcing Polly to sell her blood at the hospital.  Polly marries Dr. Jim Ridgeley, a psychiatrist, who offers her financial and moral support.

'''Priss Hartshorn''':  An idealistic believer in the FDR program, she marries Dr. Sloan Crockett, a pediatrician.  She has a job with the [[National Recovery Administration]].  She gives birth to Stephen, whom she has difficulty breast-feeding and potty-training.  Under the hospital regimen, she sleeps apart from her son, whom she hears crying most of the nights. Her husband wishes her to feed Stephen her breast milk rather than formula, a somewhat radical notion at the time.  Priss, pressured at the hospital to allow them to bottle feed the baby, also feels pressured by her husband, thinking, "Sloan…was enamored of his own theories, which he wanted to enforce, like Prohibition, regardless of the human factor".

'''Helena Davison''':  "A short, sandy haired girl with an appealing snub nose", Helena was "regarded as the droll member of the group", because of her sense of humor.  Her mother has her "tutored in every conceivable subject", including athletics, musical instruments, outdoor activities and crafts.  Despite her Vassar education, she gets a job as a teacher at an experimental school in Cleveland, Ohio, teaching "finger-painting".  She catches Kay's husband kissing another woman, Norine, a Vassar girl who was involved in left politics and not in The Group.  She decides not to tell Kay, but agrees to go to Norine's house to talk.  Norine's husband is impotent and Norine has had several affairs.  Norine asks Helena how she should fix her life, and Helena makes several suggestions, including scrubbing the floor, painting the sitting room a different color, and buying "some real food". By the end of the novel, Helena moves to New York to pursue an art career. She is the only character who remains single.

'''Libby MacAusland''':  A "tall, pretty blonde", who majored in English and is determined to break into the New York publishing industry.  Gus LeRoy, the publisher, hires her to read book manuscripts.  For five dollars apiece, she reads the manuscripts and writes a summary and opinion.  Libby can read Italian, so Gus gives her an Italian manuscript to summarize.  However, the book is mostly in a dialect, which she can't understand and she writes an inaccurate report. Gus fires her, telling her that "Publishing's a man's business…. Marry a publisher, Miss MacAusland, and be his hostess."  He later gets her a job as a literary agent's assistant and then an agent herself, becoming wealthy in the process and living well.  A Norwegian baron and ski jumper, Nils Aslund, tries to seduce her by reading Marlowe's "The Passionate Shepherd to His Love".  Libby tries to fend him off by quoting Sir Walter Raleigh's "The Shepherdess Replies".  Nils replies by ripping her clothes off and attempting to rape her; he desists when she tells him she is a virgin.

'''Norine Schmittlapp''': She is Vassar '33, but not a member of The Group.  Talking to Helena, she says, "You people were the aesthetes.  We were the politicals."  Norine is interested in psychoanalysis, socialism, and anthropology.  She has a dog named [[Nietzsche]].  While married to Putnam Blake, she has an affair with Harald, Kay's husband.  Norine's husband, Put, suffers from impotency; according to Norine, he is only aroused by "fallen women".  Norine helps Harald put Kay in the psychiatric ward by convincing Kay that she needs a rest.  She spreads the rumor that Kay was mentally disturbed, saying to Priss, "A lot of basic things were the matter.  Sex.  Competitiveness with men.  An underlying Lesbian drive that was too firmly repressed.  Thwarted social strivings."  Norine later divorces Put, and marries Freddy Rogers, a wealthy banker who has suffered from anti-Jewish discrimination.  She has a son, Ichabod.  Priss is horrified by her choice of name and her careless manner of raising Ichabod.  Norine tells Priss that her husband expects her to be a dutiful housewife, but Norine says "Our Vassar education made it tough for me to accept my womanly role".  Norine believes that because of her education, she is "crippled for life".

== Background ==
In some aspects the novel is autobiographical, in a satirical tone. Mary McCarthy studied literature at Vassar College and graduated in 1933, which is the class year of her group of eight characters. McCarthy's classmates from Vassar accused her of basing ''The Group'' characters on them and their experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Elizabeth. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/29/the-group-mary-mccarthy "The Group by Mary McCarthy."] The Guardian, 29 November 2013. Retrieved 6 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, her first husband, Harald Johnsrud, shares the first name of the husband of the character Kay; the unusual (Nordic) spelling of the name is discussed several times in the novel. In parts of the book where McCarthy discusses sex, such as when Dottie loses her virginity, the author claims to come from her memories with past lovers, as an observer.&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, Alan. "Just Words." Yale University Press, 2011, p.174.&lt;/ref&gt; McCarthy was also a supporter of [[Leon Trotsky]], a political position shared by another of the characters in the novel, Polly Andrews.

Mary McCarthy adopted the title of "lady-writer" mostly given by male critics. Although her works are supposedly written for women, they are commended by feminists. However, McCarthy denies being a feminist or writing for the "second-wave of feminism" as she believes in equality and freedom of rights, but does not view it as a gendered issue.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, Sabrina Fuchs. "Mary McCarthy: Gender, Politics, and the Postwar Intellectual." Peter Lang Publishing Inc., 2004, p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The novel topped the ''New York Times'' best-seller for almost two years. It was banned in Australia, Italy, and Ireland for being offensive to public morals.&lt;ref&gt;Brightman, Carol. "Writing Dangerously: Mary McCarthy and Her World." Clarkson Potter/Publishers, 1992, p.486.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel was reviewed critically and intensely for its vivid detail, length, and number of characters. At the time of its release, men questioned McCarthy's ability to be a professional writer. Notably, Norman Mailer for [[The New York Review of Books]]  wrote that, "her book fails as a novel by being good but not nearly good enough...she is simply not a good enough woman to write a major novel." &lt;ref&gt;Mailer, Norman. [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1963/10/17/the-mary-mccarthy-case/ "The Mary McCarthy Case."] New York Review of Books, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

When an editor suggested to [[Candace Bushnell]] that she write "the modern-day version of ''The Group''", she wrote ''[[Sex and the City]]'', a collection of revealing essays that became the popular TV series and film. As Bushnell summarizes: "''The Group'' reminds us that not much has really changed".&lt;ref name="Day"&gt;{{cite news |first=Elizabeth |last=Day |title=The Group by Mary McCarthy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/nov/29/the-group-mary-mccarthy |work=[[The Observer]] |location=London |date=29 November 2009 |accessdate=29 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film adaptation ==
{{Main article|The Group (film)}}
In 1966 [[United Artists]] released a [[The Group (film)|film]] adaptation of McCarthy's novel directed by [[Sidney Lumet]]. The main characters were played by [[Candice Bergen]] (Lakey), [[Joan Hackett]] (Dottie), [[Elizabeth Hartman]] (Priss), [[Shirley Knight]] (Polly), [[Joanna Pettet]] (Kay), [[Mary-Robin Redd]] (Pokey), [[Jessica Walter]] (Libby), [[Kathleen Widdoes]] (Helena), [[Larry Hagman]] (Harald), [[James Broderick]] (Jim), [[Richard Mulligan]] (Dick), [[Carrie Nye]] (Norine), and [[Hal Holbrook]] (Gus). The film was exhibited in competition in the 1966 [[Berlinale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Group (1966) |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060479/ |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radio ==
In 2001, ''The Group'' was broadcast on BBC Radio 4.  It was adapted by Moya O'Shea, produced/Directed by Tracey Neale, and starred [[Gayle Hunnicutt]], [[Rebecca Front]], [[Teresa Gallagher]], [[Joanna Weir]], [[Tara Ward]], [[Laurel Lefkow]], [[Lorelei King]], [[Moya O'Shea]], [[Mark Caven]], [[Henry Goodman]], and [[William Hope (actor)|William Hope]].

== Popular culture references ==
The book appears in episode ten, season three of the television series ''[[Mad Men]]''. It is also referred to in the pilot episode of the series ''[[American Dreams]]'', during a scene in which one member of a woman's book group suggests "The Group" as a title that might make her contemporaries re-evaluate their lives as housewives. The suggestion is quickly dismissed by the group's leader, ("Oh!  That sounds so…depressing"), who rules in favor of Book of the Month Club's ''[[The Shoes of the Fisherman (novel)|The Shoes of the Fisherman]]''. In the following episode of ''American Dreams'', one of the main characters, Helen Pryor, reads the book and she says that "her whole world is falling apart" because of it. 

It is also mentioned in the ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' short "The Home Economics Story" (where Joel Robinson referring to the group of college students from said short as "The Group") as well as the episode featuring the film "[[The Sinister Urge (film)|The Sinister Urge]]" (where Mike Nelson refers to a group of young women as "Mary McCarthy's 'The Group'"). 

In the film ''[[The Sterile Cuckoo]]'', the character of Pookie Adams ([[Liza Minnelli]]) can be seen clutching a copy of ''The Group'' when she departs the bus after her first encounter with love interest Jerry Payne.  Mentioned in ''[[A Right to Die]]'' by Rex Stout: Nero Wolfe "had read two chapters and ditched it."

In Season 1, episode 9 of "[[Gilmore Girls]]", Rory is seen reading a copy of the book as she stands on line to buy tickets to a dance.

'''''The Lace-Maker''''' (c. 1660s) is an [[oil on canvas]] painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Gabriël Metsu]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is part of the collection of [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]].

The woman is looking at the viewer and on her lap is a [[lace pillow]] for [[bobbin lace]]. It is one of the Metsu paintings with the longest provenance in any collection today, first recorded in 1722.

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1914, who wrote; "79. THE LACE-MAKER. Sm. 112. In a room with an oil-painting on the grey wall, a lady is seated at work with a lace pillow on her lap. She wears a grey satin dress and a blue jacket trimmed with white fur. At her feet to the left is a cat. 
Signed in full in the centre at the top ; panel, 14 inches by 10 inches. 
In the Saxon inventory of 1722, A531. 
Now in the Picture Gallery, Dresden, 1902 catalogue, No. 1736."&lt;ref&gt;[https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3AHofstede_de_Groot_catalogue_raisonn%C3%A9%2C_Volume_1%2C_1908.djvu&amp;page=300 79. The Lace-Maker] in Hofstede de Groot, 1908 {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8785">'''The Mbari Club''' was a centre for cultural activity by African writers, artists and musicians that was founded in [[Ibadan]], [[Nigeria]], in 1961 by [[Ulli Beier]], with the involvement of a group of young writers including [[Wole Soyinka]] and [[Chinua Achebe]].&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8508079/Ulli-Beier.html "Ulli Beier" (obituary)], ''[[Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 11 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Mbari-Mbayo-Club "Mbari Mbayo Club"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Mbari (art)|Mbari]]'', an [[Igbo language|Igbo]] concept related to "creation", was suggested as the name by Achebe.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;&lt;ref name=bookshy /&gt; Among other Mbari members were [[Christopher Okigbo]], [[J.

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in an obituary of Beier noted that "the Mbari Club became synonymous with the optimism and creative exuberance of Africa’s post-independence era. [[Fela Kuti]] made his debut as bandleader there, and it became a magnet for artists and writers from all over Africa, America and the Caribbean."&lt;ref name=Telegraph /&gt; In the words of Toyin Adepoju: "Coming to birth in the flux of the preindependence and immediate postindependence period in Nigeria, it brought together a constellation of artists whose work embodied the quality of transformation embodied by the aesthetic of creation, decay, and regeneration evoked by the Mbari tradition."&lt;ref name=Adepoju&gt;Toyin Adepoju, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nkVxNVvex-sC&amp;pg=PA665&amp;lpg=PA665&amp;dq=mbari+club+1961-&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=avMpHGiG_3&amp;sig=hNQYIXg-sskTOIq6wlV1XB5pihQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirprS83OvNAhXHKsAKHVK2AvwQ6AEIRDAI#v=onepage&amp;q=mbari%20club%201961-&amp;f=false "Mbari Club"], in Carole Boyce Davies (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of the African Diaspora: Origins, Experiences, and Culture: Origins, Experiences, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, 2008, p. 665.&lt;/ref&gt;

Closely connected with the literary magazine ''[[Black Orpheus (magazine)|Black Orpheus]]'', which Beier had founded in 1957, Mbari also acted as a publisher during the 1960s — considered to be the only African-based publisher of African literature at the time — producing 17 titles by African writers.&lt;ref&gt;James Currey, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/reseafrilite.44.2.8?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents "Literary Publishing After Nigerian Independence: Mbari as Celebration"], ''Research in African Literatures'', Vol. 44, No. 2, (In)Visibility in African Cultures / Zoe Norridge, Charlotte Baker, and Elleke Boehmer, Guest Editors (Summer 2013), pp. 8–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Mbari published early works by Clark, Okigbo and Soyinka, poetry by [[Bakare Gbadamosi]] (''Okiri'', 1961), [[Alex La Guma]] (''A Walk in the Night and Other Stories'', 1962), [[Dennis Brutus]] (''Sirens, Knuckles, Boots'', 1963), [[Kofi Awoonor]] and [[Lenrie Peters]],&lt;ref name=Columbia /&gt; as well as translations of francophone poetry.&lt;ref name=bookshy /&gt; Brutus was chosen as winner of the Mbari Prize, awarded to a black poet of distinction, but turned it down on the grounds of its racial exclusivity.&lt;ref&gt;Josh MacPhee, [https://justseeds.org/242-mbari-publishing/ "242: Mbari Publishing"], ''Justseeds'', 20 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Brutus, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mpSqpLpvKcMC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=Mbari+prize+&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xc8hf72JPU&amp;sig=CCSXqnTGthL_lRgo6ZrdD9jM1Lg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6qtWyhZbXAhUIY1AKHeVyC_UQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Mbari%20prize%20&amp;f=false ''The Dennis Brutus Tapes: Essays at Autobiography''] (edited by Bernth Lindfors), James Currey, 2011, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1961 by a diverse group of writers, visual artists, musicians and actors, and active throughout the 1960s, the Mbari Club was originally located in Ibadan's Dugbe Market, on the site of "an old Lebanese restaurant that was converted into an open-air performance venue, an art gallery, a library, and an office."&lt;ref name=bookshy /&gt; 

While celebrating the creativity of Nigerian talent in the [[History of Nigeria#Independence|newly independent nation]], Mbari "was an international environment, attracting artists from across Africa and beyond".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/century-city/century-city-lagos-1955-70 "Mbari writers and artists Club"], ''Century City: Lagos 1955–70'', Tate.&lt;/ref&gt; The premieres of Soyinka's ''The Trials of Brother Jero'' and Clark's ''Song of a Goat'' were staged at Mbari, and internationally renowned artists were also invited to play or exhibit their work, including [[Langston Hughes]], [[Jacob Lawrence]] and [[Pete Seeger]].&lt;ref name=Columbia /&gt; The club also initiated writing competitions.&lt;ref name=Adepoju /&gt;

As recalled by [[Lindsay Barrett]], secretary of the Mbari Club from 1966 to 1967: "We were in a historic, literary setting ... when [[Nigerian Civil War|the civil war]] [1967–70] broke out and disintegrated everything."&lt;ref&gt;Anote Ajeluorou, [http://www.nigerianbestforum.com/generaltopics/echoes-of-okigbos-poetic-legacy-at-ibadan-reading-tour/ "Echoes of Okigbo’s poetic legacy at Ibadan reading tour"], NBF Topics, 13 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mbari Mbayo===
In 1962 a similar club based on the same concepts, called '''Mbari Mbayo''' (the name this time reflecting a [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] phrase meaning: "Were I to see, I would rejoice" or "When we see it we shall be happy"),&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;&lt;ref name=Columbia /&gt; was developed in [[Oshogbo]] — about 50 miles northeast of Ibadan — by dramatist [[Duro Ladipo]] together with Beier and Mphahlele.&lt;ref name=bookshy /&gt; Ladipo converted his father's house into an art gallery and a theatre, where he produced his plays.&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; Artists who emerged from the Mbari Mbayo Club in Oshogbo include [[Twins Seven Seven]] and [[Jimoh Buraimoh]].&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt;

===Mbari-Enugu===
The Mbari-Enugu Club of Eastern Nigeria was established in 1963 and like Mbari Mbayo was particularly a platform for sculpture, painting and literary performance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yYqYAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT45&amp;lpg=PT45&amp;dq=mbari+club+members&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c7N9enyDqR&amp;sig=UstZggNo8RuyVuiITZbmiSMBNgw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjnvqyFs4LPAhVJKMAKHflOBbwQ6AEIbjAU#v=onepage&amp;q=mbari%20club%20members&amp;f=false "Common Objectives and Ambitions"] in D.

'''''The Swing''''' (French: '''''La balançoire''''') is an oil on canvas painting by the French artist [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]] who was a leading exponent of the [[Impressionist]] style. The painting was executed in 1876. The painting measures 92 x 73 centimetres and is in the [[Musée d’Orsay]]. Renoir executed the painting in what are now the [[Musée de Montmartre]] gardens. He had rented a cottage in the gardens so that he be could closer to the ''Moulin de la Galette'' where he was engaged in painting ''[[Bal du moulin de la Galette]]''.

== Description ==
Renoir's people seem to stand on a forest floor of blossoms. The girl on the swing could be fifteen, her pink dress with a hat on head increases the charm of painting.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Auguste Renoir: La Promenade By John House, Auguste Renoir, {{ISBN|0-8923-6365-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quivering light is rendered by the patches of pale colour, particularly on the clothing and the ground. This particularly annoyed the critics when the painting was shown at the Impressionist exhibition of 1877.&lt;ref&gt;Impressionism By Nathalia Brodskaļa, {{ISBN|1-8448-4743-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model was [[Jeanne Samary]], a favourite of Renoir's who appears in many of his paintings. The two men are Renoir's brother Edmond and a painter friend [[Norbert Goeneutte]] (also appearing in ''Bal'').&lt;ref name="Sotheby's"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sotheby's sale catalogue ''Au Moulin de la Galette'', New York, 17 May 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La balançoire|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/fr/collections/oeuvres-commentees/recherche/commentaire/commentaire_id/la-balancoire-385.html?no_cache=1|publisher=[[Musée d'Orsay]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Typesetters Sorting Case.jpg|thumb|An 18th-century type case, with various tools for typesetting]]
A '''type case''' is a compartmentalized wooden box used to store [[movable type]] used in [[letterpress printing]].&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;Williams, Fred (1992). "Origin of the California Job Case". ''Type &amp; Press'', fall 1992. http://www.apa-letterpress.com/T%20&amp;%20P%20ARTICLES/Type/California%20Job%20Case.html Accessed online 2 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern, factory-produced movable type was available in the late nineteenth century. It was held in the printing shop in a ''job case'', a drawer about 2&amp;nbsp;inches high, three feet wide, and about two feet deep, with many small compartments for the "[[Sort (typesetting)|sorts]]" (various letters and ligatures). The most popular and commonly used job case design in America was the [[California Job Case]], which took its name from the Pacific Coast location of the foundries that made the case popular.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amateurpress.org/bundle/camp194.htm National Amateur Press Association], Monthly Bundle Sample, Campane 194, ''The California Typecase'', Lewis A. Pryor, ed.&lt;/ref&gt; These cases allowed type to be compactly transported.

Traditionally, the capital letters were stored in a separate drawer, or case, placed above the case holding the other letters (this is why the capital letters are called "uppercase" characters, and the minuscules are "lower case").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ewSglB2f7qYC|title=Glossary of Typesetting Terms|last=Eckersley|first=Richard|last2=Angstadt|first2=Richard|last3=Ellertson|first3=Charles M.|last4=Hendel|first4=Richard|date=2008-04-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226183732|page=18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were a great variety of cases, and also variations in the "lay", or the assignment of the sorts into the compartments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Type case lay selection|url=http://www.alembicpress.co.uk/Alembicprs/SELCASE.HTM|publisher=The Alembic Press|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Different printers had different house layouts even for the same design of case.

'''Yinka Shonibare''' {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|RA}} (born 1962) is a British-Nigerian artist living in the United Kingdom. His work explores cultural identity, [[colonialism]] and [[post-colonialism]] within the contemporary context of [[globalisation]]. A hallmark of his art is the brightly coloured Dutch wax fabric he uses. Because he has a physical disability that paralyses one side of his body, Shonibare uses assistants to make works under his direction.

==Life and career==
Yinka Shonibare was born in [[London]] in 1962. When he was three years old, his family moved to Lagos, [[Nigeria]], where his father practised law. At 17, he returned to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to do his A-levels at [[Redrice School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yinkashonibarembe.com/biography/|title=Yinka Shonibare, MBE (RA) - Biography|website=www.yinkashonibarembe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/7739981/Fourth-Plinth-Yinka-Shonibare-interview.html |author=Martin Gayford|location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |title=Fourth Plinth: Yinka Shonibare interview | date=19 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shonibare contracted [[transverse myelitis]], an inflammation of the spinal cord, at the age of 18, which resulted in a long-term [[physical disability]] where one side of his body is paralysed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/yinka-shonibare_review%20Disability%20Arts%20Online |title=a unique journal for discussion of arts and culture |publisher=disability arts online |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/05/art-iculating-yinka-shonibare%E2%80%99s-hope-in-hopelessness/ |title=Art-iculating Yinka Shonibare’s hope in hopelessness |author=Japhet Alakam|work=Vanguard|location= Nigeria |date=1 May 2011 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then studied Fine Art first at [[Byam Shaw School of Art]] (now Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design) and then at [[Goldsmiths, University of London]], where he received his MFA, graduating as part of the [[Young British Artists]] generation. Following his studies, Shonibare worked as an arts development officer for [[Shape Arts]], an organization which makes arts accessible to people with disabilities.&lt;ref name="ancouk"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson |first=Lucy |url=http://www.a-n.co.uk/artists_talking/artists_stories/single/63550 |title=Yinka Shonibare &amp;#124; Artists' stories &amp;#124; Artists talking |work=a-n |date=10 January 2003 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosanna|first=Greenstreet|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/apr/30/yinka-shonibare-artist-interview|title=Q&amp;A: Yinka Shonibare |work=The Guardian|location=London|date=30 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has exhibited at the [[Venice Biennial]] and at leading museums worldwide. He was notably commissioned by [[Okwui Enwezor]] at [[documenta]] XI in 2002 to create his most recognised work ''Gallantry and Criminal Conversation'' that launched him on an international stage.

In 2004, he was shortlisted for the [[Turner Prize]] for his ''Double Dutch'' exhibition at the [[Museum Boijmans van Beuningen]] in [[Rotterdam]] and for his solo show at the Stephen Friedman Gallery, [[London]]. Of the four nominees, he seemed to be the most popular with the general public that year.  A BBC website poll, resulted in 64% of voters stating that his work was their favourite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bishop |first=Tom |url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/3756514.stm?dynamic_vote=ON#vote_3756514 |title=BBC NEWS &amp;#124; Entertainment &amp;#124; Light at end of the Turner show |publisher=Newsvote.bbc.co.uk |date=19 October 2004 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shonibare became an Honorary Fellow of Goldsmiths' College in 2003, was awarded an [[MBE]] in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contemporary-magazines.com/profile89.htm/ |title=Yinka Shonibare, MBE in conversation with Raphael Chikukwa and Michele Robecchi |publisher=''Contemporary Magazine'' |date= May 2006 |accessdate=2014-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received an [[Honorary Doctorate]] (Fine Artist) of the [[Royal College of Art]] in 2010. He was elected Royal Academician by the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/honorary-appointments/Roll%20Honorands%20as%20at%20April%202011.pdf |title=HONORARY FELLOWS OF GOLDSMITHS’ COLLEGE |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined [[Iniva]]'s Board of trustees in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iniva.org/library/archive/people/s/shonibare_mbe_yinka |title=Yinka Shonibare MBE |publisher=Iniva |date=1 February 2009 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has exhibited at the Venice Biennial and internationally at leading museums worldwide. In September 2008, his major mid-career survey commenced at the MCA Sydney and toured to the Brooklyn Museum, New York in June 2009 and the Museum of African Art at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], Washington DC in October 2009 . In 2010, ''Nelson's Ship in a Bottle'' became his first public art commission on the [[Fourth plinth, Trafalgar Square|Fourth Plinth]] in [[Trafalgar Square]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blainsouthern.com/artists/yinka-shonibare-mbe |title=Blain&amp;#124;Southern &amp;#124; Artists &amp;#124; Yinka Shonibare MBE |publisher=Blainsouthern.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, 2016, one of Shonibare's "Wind Sculpture" pieces was installed in front of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art in Washington, DC. The painted fiberglass work, titled "Wind Sculpture VII", is the first sculpture to be permanently installed outside of the NMAA's entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsdesk.si.edu/releases/national-museum-african-art-will-be-home-new-landmark-sculpture-national-mall|title=National Museum of African Art Will Be Home to New Landmark Sculpture on the National Mall|publisher=Smithsonian|accessdate=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disability==
"I do have a physical disability and I was determined that the scope of my creativity should not be restricted purely by my physicality. It would be like an architect choosing to build only what could be physically built by hand." says Shonibare.&lt;ref name="ancouk"/&gt;
Shonibare readily acknowledges physical disability as part of his identity but creates work in which this is just one strand of a far richer weave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org/http//http//yinka_shonibare_bursary |title=Yinka Shonibare: Adam Reynolds bursary |publisher=disability arts online |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his disability, he is physically incapable of carrying out the making of the work himself, and relies upon a team of assistants to realise his artistic vision for him. In this context, conceptualism takes on a new angle. "That Shonibare became a conceptual artist who delegates much of the production of his labor-intensive projects to a network of other artists is partly a result of his disabling illness."&lt;ref&gt;deborah Sontag, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/arts/design/21sont.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 "Headless Bodies from a Bottomless Imagination"], ''The New York Times'', 17 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shonibare's disability has increased with age; as his mobility has become further restricted with time, he has begun to use an [[electric wheelchair]]. In later life, Shonibare has become more open to discussing his disability and its role within his work as a creative artist.&lt;ref&gt;Yinka Shonibare, [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jan/04/what-see-mirror-yinka-shonibare "What I see in the mirror"], ''The Guardian'', 4 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Shonibare was announced as patron of the annual [[Shape Arts]] "Open" exhibition where disabled and non-disabled artists are invited to submit work in response to an Open theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shapearts.org.uk/news/shape-open-exhibition-patron-announced.aspx|title=Shape Open Exhibition Patron announced|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==
[[File:Nelson's Ship in a Bottle by Yinka Shonibare.jpg|thumb|''Nelson's Ship in a Bottle'' by Yinka Shonibare during its occupancy of the [[Fourth Plinth]] in [[Trafalgar Square]]]]

Shonibare’s work explores issues of colonialism alongside those of race and class, through a range of media which include painting, sculpture, photography, installation art, and, more recently, film and performance. He examines, in particular, the construction of identity and tangled interrelationship between Africa and Europe and their respective economic and political histories. Mining Western art history and literature, he asks what constitutes our collective contemporary identity today. Having described himself as a ‘post-colonial’ hybrid, Shonibare questions the meaning of cultural and national definitions. People always took his work seriously and he said " if love someone fight for them with your hands"

A key material in Shonibare's work since 1994 is the brightly coloured "African" fabric (Dutch wax-printed cotton) that he buys himself from Brixton market in London. "But actually, the fabrics are not really authentically African the way people think," says Shonibare. "They prove to have a crossbred cultural background quite of their own. And it’s the fallacy of that signification that I like. It’s the way I view culture – it’s an artificial construct." Shonibare claims that the fabrics were first manufactured in Europe to sell in Indonesian markets and then they were sold in Africa, when they were rejected in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Downey|first=Anthony|title=Yinka Shonibare in Conversation|journal=Wasafiri|volume=19.41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today the main exporters of "African" fabric from Europe are based in Manchester in the UK and [[Vlisco]] Véritable Hollandais from [[Helmond]] in the Netherlands. He has these fabrics made up into European 18th-century dresses, covering sculptures of alien figures or stretched onto canvases and thickly painted over.

Shonibare's ''Trumpet Boy'', a permanent acquisition displayed at [[The Foundling Museum]], demonstrates the colorful fabric used in his works. The sculpture was created to fit the theme of 'found', reflecting on the museum's heritage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foundlingmuseum.org.uk/events/found/|title=FOUND - Foundling Museum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; through combining new and existing work with found objects kept for their significance.

Sometimes,  he recreates famous paintings using headless dummies with the "Africanised" clothing instead of their original costumes, for example ''[[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough's]] Mr and Mrs Andrews Without Their Heads'' (1998),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/giveandtake/gallery/shonibare_pics.html |title=Give &amp; Take – Artist Information |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Reverend on Ice'' (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yinka-shonibare.co.uk/yinkashonibare-work/reverend-on-ice.html |title=Reverend on Ice |publisher=Yinka-shonibare.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (after ''The Rev Robert Walker Skating on Duddingston Loch'' by [[Henry Raeburn|Raeburn]]) and
''The Swing (after [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]])'' (2001).
&lt;ref name="Turner Prize 2004: Yinka Shonibare"&gt;{{cite web|title=Turner Prize 2004: Yinka Shonibare|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/turner-prize-2004/turner-prize-2004-yinka-shonibare|publisher=Tate|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An added layer to the Fragonard piece is that the fabric used is printed with the ''[[Chanel]]'' logo (though it is obviously not real Chanel fabric).

Shonibare also takes carefully posed photographs and videos recreating famous British paintings or stories from literature but with himself taking centre stage as an alternative, black British dandy, e.g., ''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' by [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]] which he translates into ''Diary of A Victorian Dandy'' (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iniva.org/exhibitions_projects/1998/diary_of_a_victorian_dandy/diary_of_a_victorian_dandy |title=Diary of a Victorian Dandy |publisher=Iniva |date=29 October 1998 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Dorian Gray'' (2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yinka-shonibare.co.uk/yinkashonibare-work/dorian-gray-detail.html |title=Dorian Gray up close |publisher=Yinka-shonibare.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; after [[Oscar Wilde]]'s novel ''[[The Picture of Dorian Gray]]''.

Considerably larger than a usual [[ship in a bottle]], yet much smaller than the real [[HMS Victory|HMS ''Victory'']], in fact a 1:30 scale model, Shonibare's ''[[Lord Nelson|Nelson]]'s Ship in a Bottle'', was "the first commission on the Fourth Plinth to reflect specifically on the historical symbolism of Trafalgar Square, which commemorates the Battle of Trafalgar, and will link directly with Nelson’s column."&lt;ref name="london1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/fourthplinth/commissions/yinka |title=Mayor of London presents Fourth Plinth &amp;#124; Yinka Shonibare MBE |publisher=London.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was placed there on 24 May 2010 and remained until 30 January 2012. Being widely admired, in 2011 the [[Art Fund]] launched a campaign and successfully raised money for the purchase and relocation of the sculpture to the [[National Maritime Museum]] in [[Greenwich]] where it now found its new permanent home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artfund.org/ship/news/2012-april/100/campaign-closes-as-permanent-new-home-secured-for-nelsons-ship-in-a-bottle |title=Campaign closes as permanent new home secured for Nelson's Ship in a Bottle! – Captain's Log – Help bring Nelson's Ship in a Bottle to Greenwich |publisher=Artfund.org |date=23 April 2012 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works include printed ceramics, and cloth-covered shoes, upholstery, walls and bowls.

In October 2013 Shonibare took part in Art Wars at the [[Saatchi Gallery]] curated by [[Ben Moore (curator)|Ben Moore]]. The artist was issued with a stormtrooper helmet, which he transformed into a work of art. Proceeds went to the Missing Tom Fund set up by Ben Moore to find his brother Tom, who has been missing for more than ten years.

== Selected artworks/exhibitions ==
Shonibare's first solo exhibition was in 1989 at [[Byam Shaw School of Art|Byam Shaw]] Gallery, London. During 2008–09, he was the subject of a major mid-career survey in both Australia and the USA; starting in September 2008 at the MCA Sydney and toured to the [[Brooklyn Museum]], New York in June 2009 and the [[National Museum of African Art|Museum of African Art]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution]], Washington DC in October 2009. For the 2009 Brooklyn Museum exhibition, he created a site-specific installation titled ''Mother and Father Worked Hard So I Can Play'' which was on view in several of the Museum’s period rooms. Another site-specific installation, ''Party Time—Re-Imagine America: A Centennial Commission'' was simultaneously on view at the [[Newark Museum]] in [[Newark, New Jersey]], from 1 July 2009, to 3 January 2010, in the dining room of the museum’s 1885 Ballantine House.

The '''Züschen tomb''' ({{lang-de|Steinkammergrab von Züschen}}, sometimes also ''Lohne-Züschen'') is a [[prehistory|prehistoric]] burial monument, located between Lohne and Züschen, near [[Fritzlar]], [[Hesse]], [[Germany]]. Classified as a [[gallery grave]] or a Hessian-Westphalian stone cist (''hessisch-westfälische Steinkiste''), it is one of the most important [[megalithic]] monuments in [[Central Europe]]. Dating to the late 4th millennium BC (and possibly remaining in use until the early 3rd), it belongs to the Late [[Neolithic]] [[Wartberg culture]]. The presence of incised carvings, comparable to prehistoric [[rock art]] elsewhere in Europe, is a striking feature of Wartberg culture tombs, known so far only from Züschen and from tomb I at [[Warburg]].&lt;ref&gt;Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 126&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC left}}

== Discovery and excavation ==
The tomb was accidentally discovered in 1894. For a number of years, a row of [[sandstone]] blocks had impeded the local miller from ploughing one of his fields. When he decided to remove them, Rudolf Gelpke, an inspector from nearby Garvensburg castle, noted the unusual presence of sandstone in the area of a [[basalt]] outcrop. On a visit to the site, he recognised it as a prehistoric monument consisting of two parallel rows of regularly shaped vertical slabs. Gelpke erroneously associated the monument with the [[Chatti]], a local [[Iron Age]] tribe. He convinced the owner of the field to remove soil only from the ends of the row. This revealed bones and pottery sherds. At this point, Wilhelm von Garvens, owner of the Garvensburg, was notified. He, in turn, informed the [[antiquarian]] Baron Felix von und zu Gilsa. After Gilsa's scrutiny, the tomb was [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavated]], still in 1894, by [[Johannes Boehlau]], former director of the State Museum at [[Kassel]].&lt;ref&gt;Story of discovery from Boehlau &amp; von Gilsa 1898&lt;/ref&gt; Further excavations took place in 1939 and 1949, under the direction of O. Uenze of the archaeological service of [[Marburg]].&lt;ref name="Kappel 1990, 3"&gt;Kappel 1990, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tomb architecture ==
The rectangular sunken chamber is 20m long and 3.5m wide. It is built of rectangular sandstone slabs, quarried several hundred meters away. Each long wall consists of a row of 12 slabs, one of which is missing. The narrow walls consist of a single slab each.&lt;ref&gt;Kappel 1990, 3; Jockenhövel 1990, 373&lt;/ref&gt;

A terminal slab separates the tomb chamber proper from a small anteroom of 2.5&amp;nbsp;m length. At the centre of this slab is a perfectly circular hole, the so-called ''Seelenloch'' (German for "soul hole"), of 50&amp;nbsp;cm diameter. This is sometimes assumed to be too narrow as an entrance for the passage of human bodies, in which case it may have served as a symbolic connection between the dead within the tomb chamber and the living, assembled in the ante-room for some [[ritual]], perhaps an [[Sacrifice|offering]] ceremony.&lt;ref name="Kappel 1990, 3"/&gt; Whether the hole could be closed, like in some comparable tombs in [[France]], is not known. The floor of the anteroom was of densely trampled mud. The presence of non-local stones outside the chamber suggests that it was originally covered by an artificial [[tumulus]]. It is not clear whether the chamber was roofed in stone or some other material (wood).&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel 1990, 373&lt;/ref&gt;

== Human remains ==
The earth inside the chamber contained numerous disarticulated human bones. Although the minimum number of individuals is as low as 27, the broken and mixed state of the remains suggests severe disturbance. Thus, it is possible that the number of persons buried here was originally higher. The discovery of an [[Urnfield]] period burial above the original depositions indicates that the destruction of the grave, disturbance of its contents and removal of the roof must have taken place before the 10th/9th century BC. Charcoal and ashes were found in a number of locations, especially with human remains near the doorstone and near the southwest terminal slab. None of the human bones showed signs of burning. There was a continuous ash layer in the centre of the anteroom.&lt;ref&gt;Kappel 1990, 6&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grave offerings ==
Most finds appeared to be from the main chamber. They were probably placed there on the same occasions as the human bodies. The low number of finds may be the result of the early destruction of the tomb. More common finds included cattle bones and stone tools, including flint knives and sickle blades as well as locally typical triangular slate axes. There were at least three bone tools, namely a chisel, a point and an arrowhead. Pottery fragments were scant; they included a clay cup similar to examples from the related [[Lohra (megalithic tomb)|Lohra tomb]] and collared bottles connected with the northern [[Funnelbeaker culture|Funnel Beaker (TRB) Culture]]. Such bottles appear to have served some special function, maybe the storage of vegetable oils or sulphur for healing purposes. A so-called ''Giant Urn'' belongs to the later burial.&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel 1990, 373; Kappel 1990, 6; W. Schwelnuß 1979: ''Wartberg-Gruppe und hessische Megalithik; ein Beitrag zum späten Neolithikum des Hessischen Berglandes'', Materialien zur Vor- und Frühgeschichte von Hessen, Bd. 4, Wiesbaden: Landesamt für Denkmalpflege, p. 47-8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rock carvings ==
[[File:Züschen tomb2.JPG|thumb|300px|Carvings inside the tomb.]]
One of the most striking features of the tomb is the presence of carved symbols on the slabs inside the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel 1990, 373-5, Kappel 1990, 6-7; Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 123-9&lt;/ref&gt; Lines are formed of rows of individual punched dots, possibly applied with a very early metal tool. One of the more common symbols is a simple line with an attached open semicircle, usually interpreted as a stylised depiction of cattle. Normally, two of these symbols are linked by a further line with emphasised terminals. This may be a simple depiction of a plough. More rarely, two of them are linked by what resembles a yoke and pole, suggesting a cart. Occasionally overlapping signs suggest that the individual carvings are in no meaningful relationship to one another, but represent an accumulation of individual signs. Similar depiction of teams of cattle are known from much more recent ([[Bronze Age|Bronze]] or [[Iron Age]]) carvings at [[Valcamonica]] near [[Capo di Ponte]], [[Northern Italy]] and at [[Mont Bégo]] in the [[France|French]] part of the [[Ligurian Alps]].&lt;ref&gt;I. 1978: ''Steinkammergräber und Menhire in Nordhessen.'', ed. Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Kassel; 6-8, 11-23, also: E. Anati, 1983: Züschen (Kassel) e Anderlingen (Hannover), Germania: Rilievamento e studio dei monumenti megalitici; ''Bolletino del Centro Camuno di Studi Preistorici'' 20; 132-135..&lt;/ref&gt; The symbols are normally assumed to reflect [[Neolithic]] [[ideology|ideological]] or [[religion|religious]] ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Raetzel-Fabian 2000, 125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconstruction==
A reconstruction of the grave can be seen in the Hessian State Museum (''Hessisches Landesmuseum'') in [[Kassel]].

==Relationships with other sites==
Like any archaeological monument, the Züschen tomb should not be seen as isolated. It is in a close relationship with its landscape and with other sites in the area. Two further tombs, Züschen II and Züschen III are known to have existed in the area. Züschen II was 150&amp;nbsp;m northwest of the main tomb, it was generally comparable, but smaller and undecorated. A third tomb, Züschen III, is located further east. Less than 1&amp;nbsp;km from the Züschen tomb lies the Hasenberg, a prominent [[basalt]] dome, the top of which contains an important Wartberg settlement. Intriguingly, the Züschen tomb also appears to be designed in such a way that its main axis point directly at the Wartberg itself, 4&amp;nbsp;km to the east.&lt;ref&gt;Jockenhövel 1990, 375-7&lt;/ref&gt;
