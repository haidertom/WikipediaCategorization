== Background ==
Utilization of halogen containing materials in processes such as water treatment, bleaching, or even general synthesis to create the final product, generates a number of organic halides. These organic halides are released in wastewater from the oil, chemical, and paper industries,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wan Osman|first=Wan Hasnidah|last2=Sheik Abdullah|first2=Siti Rozaimah|last3=Mohamad|first3=Abu Baker|last4=Kadhum|first4=Abdul Amir H.|last5=Abd Rahman|first5=Ramki|orig-year=2013|title=Simultaneous removal of AOX and COD from real recycled paper wastewater using GAC-SBBR|journal=Journal of Environmental Management|volume=121|doi=10.1016/j.jenvman.2013.02.005|year=2013|pages=80–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; and find their way to the consumer and eventually to a landfill or oceanic dumps. Within the soil, the halo compounds resist degradation and often react with metal ions, resulting in non-degradable metal complexes, increasing soil toxicity and accumulating in the food chain of aquatic organisms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savant|first=D.V.|last2=Abdul-Rahman|first2=R.|last3=Ranade|first3=D.R.|year=2005|title=Anaerobic degradation of adsorbable organic halides (AOX) from pulp and paper industry wastewater|journal=Bioresource Technology|volume=97|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2004.12.013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 2000 ppm of these bio-accumulative organic chlorides were detected in fat of fish from the waters where bleaching effluents were disposed by paper mills,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bjørseth|first=Alf|last2=Carlberg|first2=George E.|last3=Møller|first3=Mona|date=1979-03-01|title=Determination of halogenated organic compounds and mutagenicity testing of spent bleach liquors|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0048969779900275|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=11|issue=2|pages=197–211|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(79)90027-5|bibcode=1979ScTEn..11..197B}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a 2% water concentration is considered toxic for the fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Toxicity of Pulp and Paper Mill Effluent: a Literature Review|last=Hutchins|first=Floyd E|publisher=National Service Center for Environmental Publications|year=1979|isbn=|location=|pages=2|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While strict regulations from the government have reduced the high level of past emissions, these compounds find their way to water sources through improper consumer disposal of items that contain chlorinated compounds. The presence of any organic halides in natural water has been considered an indication of contamination with [[xenobiotic]]s.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grøn|first=Christian|date=1993-08-01|title=Organic Halogen Group Parameters as Indicators of Ground Water Contamination|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1745-6592.1993.tb00084.x/abstract|journal=Ground Water Monitoring &amp; Remediation|language=en|volume=13|issue=3|pages=148–158|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6592.1993.tb00084.x|issn=1745-6592}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once in water, the naturally occurring [[Humic acid|fulvic acids]] and [[humic acid]]s can lead to formation of [[mutagen]]ic compounds such as halogenated furanone MX (Z-3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-5-hydroxy-2(5H)-furanone).&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Långvik|first=Vivi-Ann|last2=Holmbom|first2=Bjarne|date=1994-03-01|title=Formation of mutagenic organic by-products and AOX by chlorination of fractions of humic water|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/004313549490006X|journal=Water Research|volume=28|issue=3|pages=553–557|doi=10.1016/0043-1354(94)90006-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumption of these [[mutagen]]ic compounds could cause several abnormalities in development and reproduction in humans through long half-lives and mimicking hormone receptors. For example, compounds like [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]] can inhibit the actions of sex hormones by binding to steroid receptors along with causing long lasting cell disruption in several tissues.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Determination of AOX ==
Persistent organic pollutants such as [[DDT|dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane]] (DDT), [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|polychlorinated biphenols]], [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], are all assessed in AOX analysis. Generally, the higher the amount of chlorine in an organic compound, the more toxic it is considered.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While there are several biochemical or electrochemical methods to remove organic halides, AOX has been preferred due to its low cost of operation and simplicity of design.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In a lab, the determination of AOX parameter consists of adsorption of organic halides from the sample on to an [[activated carbon]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The activated carbon can be [[Powdered activated carbon treatment|powdered]]&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bornhardt|first=C.|last2=Drewes|first2=J. E.|last3=Jekel|first3=M.|date=1997-01-01|title=Removal of organic halogens (AOX) from municipal wastewater by powdered activated carbon (PAC) / activated sludge (AS) treatment|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273122397002072|journal=Water Science and Technology|series=Advanced wastewater treatment: Nutrient removal and anaerobic processes|volume=35|issue=10|pages=147–153|doi=10.1016/S0273-1223(97)00207-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or granular&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and adsorbed using microcolumns&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; or a batch process, if the samples are rich in [[humic acid]]s.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Vigorous shaking is often employed in the event of a batch process to favor the adsorption of organic halide on to the activated carbon due to its electronegativity and presence of lone pairs. The inorganic halides that are also adsorbed are washed away using a strong acid such as [[nitric acid]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The carbon with adsorbed organic halide is obtained by filtration, after which the filter containing the carbon is burnt in the presence of oxygen. While combustion of hydrocarbon part of the compounds form CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, halo acids are formed from the halogens. These haloacids are absorbed into acetic acid. Subsequent use of microcolumetric titration, an electrochemical quantification method, provides the AOX content in the sample. Using the dilution ratio, the total AOX content at the location can be estimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cgi.tu-harburg.de/~awwweb/wbt/emwater/lessons/lesson_a1/lm_pg_1055.html|title=ILIAS 3|website=cgi.tu-harburg.de|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the chlorinated compounds in the sample can be determined by using [[pentane]] extraction followed by capillary [[Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry|gas chromatography]] and [[electron capture]] ([[Gas chromatography|GC-ECD]]).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The organic carbon that was remaining after the nitric acid purge can be analyzed using UV-persulfate wet oxidation followed by Infrared-detection ([[Infrared spectroscopy|IR]]).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Several other analytical techniques such as [[High-performance liquid chromatography|high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)]] could also be implemented to quantify AOX levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The general [[adsorption]] procedure is given below:

&lt;math&gt;{C^*}_(s_) + R-X (a.q)\longrightarrow {C^*}-X-R_(s_) + H_2O&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;{C^*}_(s_)&lt;/math&gt; is the activated carbon and &lt;math&gt;R-X&lt;/math&gt; is any organic halide.

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;{C^*}-X-R_(s_)

&lt;/math&gt;is the organic halide - activated carbon complex that can be filtered out.

== Treatment ==

=== Physical separation ===
In water treatment plants, organic halides are adsorbed using [[Activated carbon|GAC]] or [[Powdered activated carbon treatment|PAC]] in agitated tanks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The loaded carbon is separated using a membrane made out of materials like polypropylene &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; or cellulose nitrate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Measuring the AOX levels into and out of the treatment zone shows a drop in organic halide concentrations. Some processes use a two-step [[Activated carbon|GAC]] filtration to remove AOX precursors, and thus reduce the amount of AOX in treated waters.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vahala|first=R.|last2=Långvik|first2=V. -A.|last3=Laukkanen|first3=R.|date=1999-01-01|title=Controlling adsorbable organic halogens (AOX) and trihalomethanes (THM) formation by ozonation and two-step granule activated carbon (GAC) filtration|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0273122399006630|journal=Water Science and Technology|volume=40|issue=9|pages=249–256|doi=10.1016/S0273-1223(99)00663-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; A two step filtration process consists of two GAC filters in series. The first filter is loaded with exhausted GAC, while the second filter is loaded with fresh GAC. This set up is preferred for its increased efficiency and higher throughput capacity. The GAC is replaced cyclically and the extracted organic halide-carbon mixture is then sent for subsequent biological or chemical treatment such as ozonation to regenerate the GAC.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Often, these chemical treatments, while effective, pose economical challenges to the treatment plants.

=== Biological treatment ===
A more economically attractive option for treatment of the organic halides is through utilization of biological agents. Recently, bacteria ''(Ancylobacter aquaticus),'' fungi (''Phanerochaete chrysosporium'' and ''Coiriolus versicolor''), or synthetic enzymes have been used in the degradation of chlorinated organic compounds.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The microorganisms degrade halocompounds using either aerobic or anaerobic processes. The mechanisms of degradation include utilization of the compound as carbon source for energy, cometabolite, or as an electron acceptor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/BFb0102076|title=Biotechnology in the Pulp and Paper Industry|last=Bajpai|first=Pratima|last2=Bajpai|first2=Pramod K.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540618683|editor-last=Eriksson|editor-first=K.-E.

An example of a microbe that can degrade AOX is shown below in Figures 1&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; and 2.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=YAMADA|first=Takashi|last2=TAKAHAMA|first2=Yuhki|last3=YAMADA|first3=Yasuhiro|date=2008-05-23|title=Biodegradation of 2,4,6-Tribromophenol by Ochrobactrum sp.

[[File:PCE Degradation Chemistry.jpg|center|frame|Figure 1: Step wise degradation of PCE]]

A sample dechlorination of chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs) such as [[Tetrachloroethylene|perchloroethylene]] (PCE) by ''[[Dehalococcoides|Dehalococcoides ethenogenes]]'' has been illustrated above. PCE is one of the highly chlorinated CAHs with no known microorganisms capable of aerobic degradation.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Chunlong|last2=Bennett|first2=George N.|date=2005-01-26|title=Biodegradation of xenobiotics by anaerobic bacteria|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00253-004-1864-3|journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology|language=en|volume=67|issue=5|pages=600–618|doi=10.1007/s00253-004-1864-3|issn=0175-7598}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high [[Electronegativity|electronegative]] character of PCE renders oxidizing agent capabilities through accepting electrons by co-metabolism or dehalorespiration. In a co-metabolism, the reduction of PCE is made feasible by the utilization of a primary metabolite for carbon and energy source. In dehalorespiration, the electron transfer from oxidation of small molecules (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the major source; but, glucose, acetate, formate, and methanol can also be used) to PCE generates energy required for the bacterial growth. The hydrogen involved in this mechanism is often a product of another process such as fermentation of simple molecules like sugars or other complex molecules like fatty acids.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Moreover, due to competition from [[methanogen]]s for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, low H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations are favored by dechlorinating bacteria, and is often established through slow-release fermentation compounds such as fatty acids and decaying bacterial biomass.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiehm|first=Andreas|last2=Schmidt|first2=Kathrin R|title=Sequential anaerobic/aerobic biodegradation of chloroethenes—aspects of field application|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0958166911000309|journal=Current Opinion in Biotechnology|volume=22|issue=3|pages=415–421|doi=10.1016/j.copbio.2011.02.003|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While several enzymes and electron carriers are involved in process, two enzymes perform the dechlorination reactions–PCE reductive dehydrogenase (PCE-RDase) and TCE reductive dehydrogenase (TCE-RDase). The PCE-RDase is normally found freely in cytoplasm while the TCE-RDase is found attached to the exterior cytoplasmic membrane. These enzymes normally utilize a metal ion cluster like Fe-S cluster to complete electron transfer cycle.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hydrogen is oxidized to generate two protons and two electrons. The removal of first chloride, which is performed by PCE-RDase, reduces [[Tetrachloroethylene|PCE]] into TCE by reductive dehalogenation, where a hydride replaces the chlorine. The chloride lost from PCE gains the two electrons and the proton that accompanies them to form HCl. TCE can be reduced to [[1,2-Dichloroethene|''cis''-dichloroethene]] (cis-DCE) by either PCE-RDase or TCE-RDase. Subsequent reductions to [[vinyl chloride]] (VC) and [[ethylene]] are performed by TCE-RDase. The dechlorination of PCE to cis-DCE is faster and thermodynamically more favorable than dechlorination of cis-DCE to VC. The transformation of VC to ethylene is the slowest step of the process and hence limits the overall rate of the reaction.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The rate of reductive dechlorination is also directly correlated with the number of chlorine atoms, and as such, it decreases with a decreasing number of chlorine atoms.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In addition, while several groups of bacteria such as ''[[Desulfomonile]]'', ''[[Dehalobacter]]'', ''[[Desulfuromonas]]''...etc. can perform the dehalogenation of PCE to TCE, only the ''[[Dehalococcoides]]'' group can perform the complete reductive dechlorination from [[Tetrachloroethylene|PCE]] to [[Ethylene|ethene]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

In addition to dechlorination of CAHs, microbes have also been reported to act on chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons. An example of a reaction where aromatic AOX content has been reduced is demonstrated in figure 2 above.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Song|first=Xueping|last2=Pei|first2=Yong|last3=Su|first3=Jingjing|last4=Qin|first4=Chengrong|last5=Wang|first5=Shuangfei|last6=Nie|first6=Shuangxi|date=2016-07-19|title=Kinetics of Adsorbable Organic Halides (AOX) Reduction in Laccase-Aided Chlorine Dioxide Bleaching of Bagasse Pulp|url=http://ojs.cnr.ncsu.edu/index.php/BioRes/article/view/BioRes_11_3_7462_Song_Kinetics_Adsorbable_Organic_Halides|journal=BioResources|language=en|volume=11|issue=3|pages=7462–7475|doi=10.15376/biores.11.3.7462-7475|issn=1930-2126}}&lt;/ref&gt; While little is known about the dehalogenation mechanisms of polyhalogenated phenols (PHPs) and polyhalogenated benzenes (PHBs), regioselectivity for halide location on the aromatic ring was observed.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This regioselectivity is however dominated by both redox potentials for the reaction and the microbe's familiarity to the reaction.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Moreover, due to the specificity of most microbes along with complex aromatic structures, in order to achieve a complete dehalogenation, a mixture of more than one species of bacteria and/or fungi (often known as a consortium) is utilized.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The reaction in figure 2 shows the reductive debromination of [[2,4,6-Tribromophenol|2,4,6-tribromophenol]] (2,4,6-TBP) by ''[[Ochrobactrum|Ochrabactrum]]''.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Based on the relative degradation of the molecule along with analytical results, it has been postulated that degradation of 2,4,6-TBP proceeds through debromination of ''ortho''-bromine in the first step by a dehalogenase to yield [[2,4-Dibromophenol|2,4-dibromophenol]] (2,4-DBP). Since there are two ''ortho'' bromines, debromination of either ''ortho'' carbons would yield the same product . Other species such as ''[[Pseudomonas glathei|Pseudomonas galthei]]'' or ''[[Azotobacter|Azotobacter sp.]]'' showed preference for ''para''-halide over the ''meta''- ''or ortho'' -halides. For example, the ''[[Azotobacter|Azotobacter sp.]]'' degrades [[2,4,6-Trichlorophenol|2,4,6-trichlorophenol]] (2,4,6-TCP) into 2,6-dichlorohydroquinone due to TCP-4-monooxygenase selectivity differences between ''ortho-'' and ''para''-halide. These differences in regioselectivity between the species can be attributed to the specificity of the 3-dimensional enzyme structure and its hindrance from steric interactions.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It has been postulated that a proton lost by the phenol group of 2,4,6-TBP resulting in the formation of a negatively charged halo-phenolate ion. Subsequent attack of the ''para-''carbon with a hydride anion from NAD(P)H in a nucleophilic attack manner and resonance rearrangement results in substitution of bromine with hydride and formation of 2,4-DBP. Subsequent steps in a similar pattern yield 2-bromophenol, and [[phenol]] in the final step. [[Phenol]] can be metabolized by microorganisms to make [[methane]] and [[carbon dioxide]] or can be extracted easier than AOXs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Related terms ==
Organic halides, [[extractable organic halides]] (EOX), and [[total organic halides]] (TOX) are related content for this topic. EOX provides information on how halides can be extracted using a solvent while TOX provides information about the total organic halide content in the sample. This value can be used to estimate [[Basic oxygen demand]] (BOD) or [[chemical oxygen demand]] (COD), a key factor in estimating the required oxygen to burn the organic compounds to estimate the percentage of AOX’s and Extractable organic halides.

'''Ammonia''' is a [[chemical compound|compound]] of [[nitrogen]] and [[hydrogen]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The simplest [[pnictogen hydride]], ammonia is a colourless [[gas]] with a characteristic pungent smell. It is a common [[Metabolic waste#Nitrogen wastes|nitrogenous waste]], particularly among aquatic organisms, and it contributes significantly to the [[nutrition]]al needs of terrestrial organisms by serving as a precursor to [[food]] and [[fertilizer]]s. Ammonia, either directly or indirectly, is also a building block for the synthesis of many [[pharmaceuticals|pharmaceutical products]] and is used in many commercial cleaning products. It is mainly collected by downward displacement of both air and water. Ammonia is named for the Ammonians, worshipers of the [[Egyptian god]] [[Amun]], who used [[ammonium chloride]] in their rituals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ch.ic.ac.uk/rzepa/mim/environmental/html/ammonia.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Although common in nature and in wide use, ammonia is both [[Caustic (substance)|caustic]] and [[hazard]]ous in its concentrated form. It is classified as an [[List of extremely hazardous substances|extremely hazardous substance]] in the United States, and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities which produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.&lt;ref name="gov-right-know"&gt;{{Cite journal | publisher = [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]] | title = 40 C.F.R.: Appendix A to Part 355—The List of Extremely Hazardous Substances and Their Threshold Planning Quantities | url = http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2008/julqtr/pdf/40cfr355AppA.pdf | edition = 1 July 2008 | accessdate = 29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global industrial production of ammonia in 2014 was 176 million tonnes,&lt;ref name=USGS2016&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/mcs/2016/mcs2016.pdf |title=pg. 119 – Nitrogen |publisher=[[USGS]] |year=2016 |format=PDF |accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 16% increase over the 2006 global industrial production of 152 million tonnes.&lt;ref name=USGS2016-ds140&gt;{{cite web |url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/historical-statistics/ds140-nitro.xlsx |title=Nitrogen |publisher=[[USGS]] |year=2016 |format=PDF |accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial ammonia is sold either as [[ammonia liquor]] (usually 28% ammonia in water) or as pressurized or refrigerated anhydrous liquid ammonia transported in tank cars or cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=[[R. Norris Shreve]]|author2=[[Joseph Brink]]|title=Chemical Process Industries |date=1977|isbn=0-07-057145-7|page=276|edition=4th}} See also [[Gas carrier]] and [[Bottled gas]].&lt;/ref&gt;

NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; boils at {{convert|−33.34|°C|°F|3}} at a pressure of one [[Atmosphere (unit)|atmosphere]], so the liquid must be stored under pressure or at low temperature. Household ammonia or [[ammonium hydroxide]] is a solution of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in water. The concentration of such solutions is measured in units of the [[Baumé scale]] ([[density]]), with 26 degrees baumé (about 30% (by weight) ammonia at {{convert|15.5|°C|°F|disp=or}}) being the typical high-concentration commercial product.&lt;ref name=LaRoche&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airgasspecialtyproducts.com/UserFiles/laroche/PDF/AAPhysical.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071127011850/http://www.airgasspecialtyproducts.com/UserFiles/laroche/PDF/AAPhysical.pdf |archivedate=27 November 2007 |title=Ammonium hydroxide physical properties}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural occurrence==
Ammonia is a chemical found in trace quantities in nature, being produced from nitrogenous animal and vegetable matter. Ammonia and ammonium salts are also found in small quantities in rainwater, whereas [[ammonium chloride]] ([[sal ammoniac]]), and [[ammonium sulfate]] are found in volcanic districts; crystals of [[ammonium bicarbonate]] have been found in [[Patagonia]]n [[guano]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=861}} The [[kidney]]s secrete ammonia to neutralize excess acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10360635|year=1999|author1=Kirschbaum, B |author2=Sica, D |author3=Anderson, F. P. |title=Urine electrolytes and the urine anion and osmolar gaps.|volume=133|issue=6|pages=597–604|issn=0022-2143|journal=The Journal of laboratory and clinical medicine|doi=10.1016/S0022-2143(99)90190-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonium salts are found distributed through fertile soil and in seawater.

Ammonia is also found throughout the [[Solar System]] on [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], [[Neptune]], and [[Pluto]], among other places: on smaller, icy planets such as Pluto, ammonia can act as a geologically important antifreeze, as a mixture of water and ammonia can have a melting point as low as {{convert|173|K|C F}} if the ammonia concentration is high enough and thus allow such planets to retain internal oceans and active geology at a far lower temperature than would be possible with water alone.&lt;ref&gt;Shannon, Francis Patrick (1938) [http://digital.lib.lehigh.edu/eb/supp/3646/index.pdf Tables of the properties of aqua-ammonia solutions. Part 1 of The Thermodynamics of Absorption Refrigeration]. Lehigh University studies. Science and technology series&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2015/Q4/an-ammonia-water-slurry-may-swirl-below-plutos-icy-surface.html An ammonia-water slurry may swirl below Pluto's icy surface]. Purdue University (9 November 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Substances containing ammonia, or those that are similar to it, are called ''ammoniacal''.

==Properties==
Ammonia is a colourless [[gas]] with a characteristic pungent smell. It is [[lighter than air]], its density being 0.589 times that of [[Earth's atmosphere|air]]. It is easily liquefied due to the strong [[hydrogen bond]]ing between molecules; the [[liquid]] boils at {{convert|-33.3|°C|°F|2}}, and freezes at {{convert|-77.7|°C|°F|2}} to white crystals.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=861}}

Ammonia may be conveniently deodorized by reacting it with either sodium bicarbonate or [[acetic acid]]. Both of these reactions form an odourless ammonium salt.

;Solid: The crystal symmetry is cubic, [[Pearson symbol]] cP16, [[space group]] P2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;3 No.198, lattice constant 0.5125&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1107/S0567739479001340|title=The crystal structure of deuteroammonia between 2 and 180 K by neutron powder profile refinement|year=1979|last1=Hewat|first1=A. W.|last2=Riekel|first2=C.|journal=Acta Crystallographica Section A|volume=35|issue=4|page=569|bibcode = 1979AcCrA..35..569H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Liquid: [[Liquid]] ammonia possesses strong [[ion]]ising powers reflecting its high [[Dielectric constant|ε]] of 22. Liquid ammonia has a very high [[Enthalpy of vaporization|standard enthalpy change of vaporization]] (23.35&amp;nbsp;[[Joule|kJ]]/mol, ''cf.'' [[Properties of water|water]] 40.65&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, methane 8.19&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, [[phosphine]] 14.6&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol) and can therefore be used in laboratories in uninsulated vessels without additional refrigeration. See [[#Liquid ammonia as a solvent|liquid ammonia as a solvent]].

;Solvent properties: Ammonia is [[Miscibility|miscible]] with water. In an aqueous solution, it can be expelled by boiling. The [[water|aqueous]] solution of ammonia is [[Base (chemistry)|basic]]. The maximum concentration of ammonia in water (a [[saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] solution) has a [[density]] of 0.880 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and is often known as '.880 ammonia'. Ammonia does not burn readily or sustain [[combustion]], except under narrow fuel-to-air mixtures of 15–25% air.

;Combustion: When mixed with [[oxygen]], it burns with a pale yellowish-green flame. At high temperature and in the presence of a suitable catalyst, ammonia is decomposed into its constituent elements. Ignition occurs when [[chlorine]] is passed into ammonia, forming nitrogen and [[hydrogen chloride]]; if chlorine is present in excess, then the highly explosive [[nitrogen trichloride]] (NCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is also formed.

===Structure===
The ammonia molecule has a [[Trigonal pyramid (chemistry)|trigonal pyramidal]] shape as predicted by the [[valence shell electron pair repulsion theory]] (VSEPR theory) with an experimentally determined bond angle of 106.7°.&lt;ref name="CRC 94th"&gt;{{cite book | editor= Haynes, William M. | year = 2013 | title = [[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]] | edition = 94th | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | isbn = 9781466571143|pages=9–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central nitrogen atom has five outer electrons with an additional electron from each hydrogen atom. This gives a total of eight electrons, or four electron pairs that are arranged tetrahedrally. Three of these electron pairs are used as bond pairs, which leaves one lone pair of electrons. The lone pair of electrons repel more strongly than bond pairs, therefore the bond angle is not 109.5°, as expected for a regular tetrahedral arrangement, but 106.7°.&lt;ref name="CRC 94th"/&gt; The nitrogen atom in the molecule has a [[Lone pair|lone electron pair]], which makes ammonia a [[Base (chemistry)|base]], a proton acceptor. This shape gives the molecule a [[dipole]] moment and makes it [[Polar molecule|polar]]. The molecule's polarity, and especially, its ability to form [[hydrogen bond]]s, makes ammonia highly miscible with water. Ammonia is moderately basic, a 1.0 M aqueous solution has a pH of 11.6 and if a strong acid is added to such a solution until the solution is neutral (pH = 7), 99.4% of the ammonia molecules are [[Protonation|protonated]]. Temperature and [[salinity]] also affect the proportion of NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The latter has the shape of a regular [[tetrahedron]] and is [[isoelectronic]] with [[methane]].

The ammonia molecule readily undergoes [[nitrogen inversion]] at room temperature; a useful analogy is an [[umbrella]] turning itself inside out in a strong wind. The energy barrier to this inversion is 24.7 kJ/mol, and the [[resonance frequency]] is 23.79 [[Hertz|GHz]], corresponding to [[microwave]] radiation of a [[wavelength]] of 1.260&amp;nbsp;cm. The absorption at this frequency was the first [[Microwave spectroscopy|microwave spectrum]] to be observed.&lt;ref name="Cleeton"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.45.234|title=Electromagnetic Waves of {{convert|1.1|cm|0|abbr=on}}. Wave-Length and the Absorption Spectrum of Ammonia|year=1934|author=Cleeton, C. E.|journal=Physical Review|volume=45|issue=4|pages=234|first2=N. H.|last2=Williams|bibcode = 1934PhRv...45..234C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amphotericity===
One of the most characteristic properties of ammonia is its [[basicity]]. Ammonia is considered to be a weak base. It combines with [[acid]]s to form [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s; thus with [[hydrochloric acid]] it forms [[ammonium chloride]] (sal ammoniac); with [[nitric acid]], [[ammonium nitrate]], etc. Perfectly dry ammonia will not combine with perfectly dry [[hydrogen chloride]]; moisture is necessary to bring about the reaction.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=862}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Influence of moisture on chemical change|author=Baker, H. B. |year=1894|journal=J. Chem. Soc.|volume=65|pages= 611–624|doi=10.1039/CT8946500611}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a demonstration experiment, opened bottles of concentrated ammonia and hydrochloric acid produce clouds of ammonium chloride, which seem to appear "out of nothing" as the salt forms where the two diffusing clouds of molecules meet, somewhere between the two bottles.
:NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + HCl → NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl

The salts produced by the action of ammonia on acids are known as the [[:Category:Ammonium compounds|ammonium salts]] and all contain the [[ammonium|ammonium ion]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=862}}

Although ammonia is well known as a weak base, it can also act as an extremely weak acid. It is a protic substance and is capable of formation of amides (which contain the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion). For example, [[lithium]] dissolves in liquid ammonia to give a solution of [[lithium amide]]:

: 2Li + 2NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2LiNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

===Self-dissociation===
Like water, ammonia undergoes [[molecular autoionisation]] to form its [[conjugate acid|acid and base conjugates]]:
:2 {{chem|NH|3}} (aq) {{eqm}} {{chem|NH|4|+}} (aq) + {{chem|NH|2|-}} (aq)

Ammonia often functions as a [[weak base]], so it has some [[buffer solution|buffering]] ability. Shifts in pH will cause more or fewer [[ammonium]] cations ({{chem|NH|4|+}}) and amide anions ({{chem|NH|2|-}}) to be present in [[solution]]. At standard pressure and temperature, K=[{{chem|NH|4|+}}][{{chem|NH|2|-}}] = 10{{su|p=−30}}

===Combustion===
The combustion of ammonia to nitrogen and water is [[exothermic]]:
: 4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (''g'') [[Standard enthalpy of reaction|Δ''H''°&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;]] = −1267.20 kJ/mol (or −316.8 kJ/mol if expressed per mol of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)

The [[standard enthalpy change of combustion]], Δ''H''°&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;, expressed per [[mole (unit)|mole]] of ammonia and with condensation of the water formed, is −382.81&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol. Dinitrogen is the thermodynamic product of combustion: all [[nitrogen oxide]]s are unstable with respect to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is the principle behind the [[catalytic converter]]. Nitrogen oxides can be formed as kinetic products in the presence of appropriate catalysts, a reaction of great industrial importance in the production of [[nitric acid]]:
:4 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 4 NO + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

A subsequent reaction leads to NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:2 NO + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The combustion of ammonia in air is very difficult in the absence of a catalyst (such as [[platinum]] gauze or warm [[chromium(III) oxide]]), because the temperature of the flame is usually lower than the ignition temperature of the ammonia–air mixture. The flammable range of ammonia in air is 16–25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw1st|page=485}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Formation of other compounds===
In [[organic chemistry]], ammonia can act as a [[nucleophile]] in [[Nucleophilic substitution|substitution]] reactions. [[Amine]]s can be formed by the reaction of ammonia with [[alkyl halide]]s, although the resulting -NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; group is also nucleophilic and secondary and tertiary amines are often formed as byproducts. An excess of ammonia helps minimise multiple substitution and neutralises the [[hydrogen halide]] formed. [[Methylamine]] is prepared commercially by the reaction of ammonia with [[chloromethane]], and the reaction of ammonia with 2-bromopropanoic acid has been used to prepare [[racemic]] [[alanine]] in 70% yield. [[Ethanolamine]] is prepared by a ring-opening reaction with [[ethylene oxide]]: the reaction is sometimes allowed to go further to produce [[diethanolamine]] and [[triethanolamine]].

[[Amide]]s can be prepared by the reaction of ammonia with [[carboxylic acid]] derivatives. [[Acyl chloride]]s are the most reactive, but the ammonia must be present in at least a twofold excess to neutralise the [[hydrogen chloride]] formed. [[Ester]]s and [[anhydride]]s also react with ammonia to form amides. Ammonium salts of carboxylic acids can be [[Dehydration|dehydrated]] to amides so long as there are no thermally sensitive groups present: temperatures of 150–200&amp;nbsp;°C are required.

The hydrogen in ammonia is capable of replacement by [[metal]]s; thus, [[magnesium]] burns in the gas with the formation of [[magnesium nitride]] Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and when the gas is passed over heated [[sodium]] or [[potassium]], sodamide, NaNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and potassamide, KNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are formed.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=862}} Where necessary in [[IUPAC nomenclature|substitutive nomenclature]], [[IUPAC]] recommendations prefer the name "azane" to ammonia: hence [[chloramine]] would be named "chloroazane" in substitutive nomenclature, not "chloroammonia".

Pentavalent ammonia is known as λ&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;-amine, or more commonly, ammonium hydride. This crystalline solid is only stable under high pressure and decomposes back into trivalent ammonia and hydrogen gas at normal conditions. This substance was once investigated as a possible solid rocket fuel in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0373800|title=High pressure chemistry of hydrogenous fuels|author1=Sterrett, K. F. |author2=Caron, A. P. |publisher=Northrop Space Labs|year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia can act as a [[ligand]] in [[transition metal]] [[complex (chemistry)|complexes]]. It is a pure σ-donor, in the middle of the [[spectrochemical series]], and shows intermediate [[HSAB concept|hard-soft]] behaviour. For historical reasons, ammonia is named '''ammine''' in the nomenclature of [[coordination compound]]s. Some notable ammine complexes include tetraamminediaquacopper(II) ([Cu(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;), a dark blue complex formed by adding ammonia to a solution of copper(II) salts. Tetraamminediaquacopper(II) hydroxide is known as [[Schweizer's reagent]], and has the remarkable ability to dissolve [[cellulose]]. Diamminesilver(I) ([Ag(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is the active species in [[Tollens' reagent]]. Formation of this complex can also help to distinguish between precipitates of the different silver halides: [[silver chloride]] (AgCl) is soluble in dilute (2M) ammonia solution, [[silver bromide]] (AgBr) is only soluble in concentrated ammonia solution, whereas [[silver iodide]] (AgI) is insoluble in aqueous ammonia.

Ammine complexes of [[chromium]](III) were known in the late 19th century, and formed the basis of [[Alfred Werner]]'s revolutionary theory on the structure of coordination compounds. Werner noted only two isomers (''fac''- and ''mer''-) of the complex [CrCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] could be formed, and concluded the ligands must be arranged around the metal ion at the [[wikt:vertex|vertices]] of an [[octahedron]]. This proposal has since been confirmed by [[X-ray crystallography]].

An ammine ligand bound to a metal ion is markedly more acidic than a free ammonia molecule, although deprotonation in aqueous solution is still rare. One example is the [[Mercury(I) chloride|Calomel reaction]], where the resulting amidomercury(II) compound is highly insoluble.
:Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Hg + HgCl(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) + NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

==Detection and determination==
{{about|section=true|detection in the laboratory|detection in astronomy|#In astronomy}}

===Ammonia in solution===
{{main|Ammonia solution}}
Ammonia and ammonium salts can be readily detected, in very minute traces, by the addition of [[Nessler's solution]], which gives a distinct yellow colouration in the presence of the slightest trace of ammonia or ammonium salts. The amount of ammonia in ammonium salts can be estimated quantitatively by distillation of the salts with [[sodium hydroxide|sodium]] or [[potassium hydroxide]], the ammonia evolved being absorbed in a known volume of standard [[sulfuric acid]] and the excess of acid then determined [[volumetric analysis|volumetrically]]; or the ammonia may be absorbed in [[hydrochloric acid]] and the ammonium chloride so formed precipitated as [[ammonium hexachloroplatinate]], (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PtCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=863}}

===Gaseous ammonia===
[[Sulfur sticks]] are burnt to detect small leaks in industrial ammonia refrigeration systems. Larger quantities can be detected by warming the salts with a caustic alkali or with [[calcium oxide|quicklime]], when the characteristic smell of ammonia will be at once apparent.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=863}} Ammonia is an irritant and irritation increases with concentration; the [[permissible exposure limit]] is 25&amp;nbsp;ppm, and lethal above 500&amp;nbsp;ppm.&lt;ref&gt;(OSHA) Source: Sax,  N.

===Ammoniacal nitrogen (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-N)===
[[Ammoniacal nitrogen]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-N) is a measure commonly used for testing the quantity of [[ammonium]] ions, derived naturally from ammonia, and returned to ammonia via organic processes, in water or waste liquids. It is a measure used mainly for quantifying values in waste treatment and water purification systems, as well as a measure of the health of natural and man-made water reserves. It is measured in units of mg/L ([[milligram]] per [[litre]]).

[[File:Ammoniak Reaktor BASF.jpg|thumb|upright|This high-pressure reactor was built in 1921 by [[BASF]] in [[Ludwigshafen]] and was re-erected on the premises of the [[University of Karlsruhe]] in Germany.]]
The ancient Greek historian [[Herodotus]] mentioned that there were [[outcrop]]s of salt in an area of Libya that was inhabited by a people called the "Ammonians" (now:  the [[Siwa oasis]] in northwestern Egypt, where salt lakes still exist).&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus with George Rawlinson, trans., ''The History of Herodotus'' (New York, New York:  Tandy-Thomas Co., 1909), vol.2, Book 4, § 181, [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uva.x004090527;view=1up;seq=330 pp. 304–305.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The land of the Ammonians is mentioned elsewhere in Herodotus' ''History'' and in [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias']] ''Description of Greece'':

In the form of sal ammoniac ''(نشادر, nushadir)'' ammonia was important to the [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|Muslim alchemists]] as early as the 8th century, first mentioned by the Persian-Arab chemist [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]],&lt;ref name="Haq1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Haq|first=Syed Nomanul|title=Names, Natures and Things: The Alchemist Jabir Ibn Hayyan and His Kitab Al-Ahjar (Book of Stones)|url=https://books.google.com/?id=P-70YjP0nj8C|accessdate=22 June 2010|date=28 February 1995|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-3254-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the European [[Alchemy|alchemists]] since the 13th century, being mentioned by [[Albertus Magnus]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=861}} It was also used by [[dye]]rs in the [[Middle Ages]] in the form of fermented [[urine]] to alter the colour of vegetable dyes. In the 15th century, [[Basilius Valentinus]] showed that ammonia could be obtained by the action of alkalis on sal ammoniac.&lt;ref&gt;''Spiritus salis urinæ'' (spirit of the salt of urine, i.e., ammonium carbonate) had apparently been produced before Valentinus, although he presented a new, simpler method for preparing it in his book:  Valentinus, Basilius, ''Vier Tractätlein Fr.

The [[Haber–Bosch process]] to produce ammonia from the nitrogen in the air was developed by [[Fritz Haber]] and [[Carl Bosch]] in 1909 and patented in 1910.

Before the availability of natural gas, hydrogen as a precursor to [[ammonia production]] was produced via the [[electrolysis]] of water or using the [[chloralkali process]].

With the advent of the steel industry in the 20th century, ammonia became a byproduct of the production of coking coal.

==Uses==

===Fertilizer===
Globally, approximately 88% (as of 2014) of ammonia is used as fertilizers either as its salts, solutions or anhydrously.&lt;ref name="USGS2016"/&gt; When applied to soil, it helps provide increased yields of crops such as maize and wheat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lassaletta|first1=Luis|last2=Billen|first2=Gilles|last3=Grizzetti|first3=Bruna|last4=Anglade|first4=Juliette|last5=Garnier|first5=Josette|title=50 year trends in nitrogen use efficiency of world cropping systems: the relationship between yield and nitrogen input to cropland|journal=Environmental Research Letters|date=2014|volume=9|issue=10|pages=105011|doi=10.1088/1748-9326/9/10/105011|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/9/10/105011/meta|language=en|issn=1748-9326|bibcode=2014ERL.....9j5011L}}&lt;/ref&gt; 30% of agricultural nitrogen applied in the USA is in the form of anhydrous ammonia and worldwide 110 million tonnes are applied each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/anhydrous-ammonia-fertilizer-abundant-important-hazardous/2013/04/18/c2d4c69c-a85a-11e2-a8e2-5b98cb59187f_story.html|title=Anhydrous ammonia fertilizer:  abundant, important, hazardous|publisher=Washington Post|author=David Brown|date=18 April 2013|accessdate=23 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precursor to nitrogenous compounds===
Ammonia is directly or indirectly the precursor to most nitrogen-containing compounds. Virtually all synthetic nitrogen compounds are derived from ammonia. An important derivative is [[nitric acid]]. This key material is generated via the [[Ostwald process]] by [[oxidation]] of ammonia with air over a [[platinum]] catalyst at {{convert|700|–|850|°C}}, ~9 atm. [[Nitric oxide]] is an intermediate in this conversion:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Holleman, A. F. |author2=Wiberg, E. |title=Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Academic Press|location= San Diego|year=2001|isbn=0-12-352651-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Nitric acid is used for the production of [[fertilizer]]s, [[explosive]]s, and many organonitrogen compounds.

Ammonia is also used to make the following compounds:
* [[Hydrazine]], in the [[Olin Raschig process]] and the [[peroxide process]]
* [[Hydrogen cyanide]], in the [[BMA process]] and the [[Andrussow process]]
* [[Hydroxylamine]] and [[ammonium carbonate]], in the [[Raschig process]]
* [[Phenol]], in the [[Raschig–Hooker process]]
* [[Urea]], in the [[Bosch–Meiser urea process]] and in [[Wöhler synthesis]]
* [[Amino acid]]s, using [[Strecker amino-acid synthesis]]
* [[Acrylonitrile]], in the [[Sohio process]]

Ammonia can also be used to make compounds in reactions which are not specifically named. Examples of such compounds include: [[ammonium perchlorate]], [[ammonium nitrate]], [[formamide]], [[dinitrogen tetroxide]], [[alprazolam]], [[ethanolamine]], [[ethyl carbamate]], [[hexamethylenetetramine]], and [[ammonium bicarbonate]].

===As a cleaner===
Household ammonia is a solution of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in water (i.e., [[ammonium hydroxide]]) used as a general purpose cleaner for many surfaces. Because ammonia results in a relatively streak-free shine, one of its most common uses is to clean glass, porcelain and stainless steel. It is also frequently used for cleaning ovens and soaking items to loosen baked-on grime.

Solutions of ammonia ranging from 16% to 25% are used in the [[Industrial fermentation|fermentation]] industry as a source of nitrogen for microorganisms and to adjust pH during fermentation.

===Antimicrobial agent for food products===
As early as in 1895, it was known that ammonia was "strongly [[antiseptic]] ... it requires 1.4 grams per litre to preserve [[beef tea]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/disinfectiondisi00rideuoft|title=Disinfection and Disinfectants: An Introduction to the Study of|author=Samuel Rideal|publisher=Charles Griffin and Company|place=London|year=1895|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, anhydrous ammonia destroyed 99.999% of [[zoonotic bacteria]] in 3 types of [[compound feed|animal feed]], but not [[silage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijfoodmicro.2007.11.040|title=Ammonia disinfection of animal feeds — Laboratory study|author=Tajkarimi, Mehrdad|journal=International Journal of Food Microbiology|volume=122|issue= 1–2|year=2008|pages=23–28|pmid=18155794|last2=Riemann|first2=H.

Lean finely textured beef in the beef industry is made from fatty [[beef trimmings]] (c. 50–70% fat) by removing the fat using heat and [[centrifugation]], then treating it with ammonia to kill ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''. The process was deemed effective and safe by the [[US Department of Agriculture]] based on a study that found that the treatment reduces ''E. coli'' to undetectable levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/04/health/04meat.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Burger That Shattered Her Life | first=Michael | last=Moss | date=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been safety concerns about the process as well as consumer complaints about the taste and smell of beef treated at optimal levels of ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/31/us/31meat.html | work=The New York Times | title=Safety of Beef Processing Method Is Questioned | first=Michael | last=Moss | date=31 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The level of ammonia in any final product has not come close to toxic levels to humans.

===Minor and emerging uses===

====Refrigeration – R717====
Because of ammonia's vaporization properties, it is a useful [[refrigerant]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; It was commonly used before the popularisation of [[chlorofluorocarbon]]s (Freons). Anhydrous ammonia is widely used in industrial refrigeration applications and hockey rinks because of its high [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]] and low cost. It suffers from the disadvantage of toxicity, which restricts its domestic and small-scale use. Along with its use in modern [[vapor-compression refrigeration]] it is used in a mixture along with hydrogen and water in [[absorption refrigerator]]s. The [[Kalina cycle]], which is of growing importance to geothermal power plants, depends on the wide boiling range of the ammonia–water mixture. Ammonia coolant is also used in the S1 radiator aboard the [[International Space Station]] in two loops which are used to regulate the internal temperature and enable temperature dependent experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/cooling-system-keeps-space-station-safe-productive|title=Cooling System Keeps Space Station Safe, Productive|last=Wright|first=Jerry|date=2015-04-13|work=NASA|access-date=2017-07-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.space.com/21059-space-station-cooling-system-explained-infographic.html|title=International Space Station's Cooling System: How It Works (Infographic)|work=Space.com|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====For remediation of gaseous emissions====
Ammonia is used to scrub SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the burning of fossil fuels, and the resulting product is converted to ammonium sulfate for use as fertilizer. Ammonia neutralizes the nitrogen oxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;) pollutants emitted by diesel engines. This technology, called SCR ([[selective catalytic reduction]]), relies on a [[vanadia]]-based catalyst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=7 July 2009|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/mar2008/db20080321_748642_page_3.htm |title=Diesel: Greener Than You Think}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ammonia may be used to mitigate gaseous spills of [[phosgene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[International Programme on Chemical Safety]] | title = Phosgene: Health and Safety Guide | year = 1998 | url = http://www.inchem.org/documents/hsg/hsg/hsg106.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== As a fuel ====
[[File:AmmoniacalGasEngineStreetcarARWaud.jpeg|thumb|Ammoniacal Gas Engine [[Streetcars in New Orleans|Streetcar in New Orleans]] drawn by [[Alfred Waud]] in 1871.]]
[[File:x-15.jpg|thumb|The [[X-15]] [[aircraft]] used ammonia as one component [[fuel]] of its [[rocket]] [[engine]] ]]
The raw [[energy density]] of liquid ammonia is 11.5 MJ/L,&lt;ref name="Lan"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lan|first=Rong|last2=Tao|first2=Shanwen|date=28 August 2014|title=Ammonia as a suitable fuel for fuel cells|journal=Frontiers in Energy Research|volume=2|pages=35|doi=10.3389/fenrg.2014.00035}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is about a third that of [[diesel fuel|diesel]]. Although it can be used as a fuel, for a number of reasons this has never been common or widespread. In addition to direct utilization of ammonia as a fuel in combustion engines, there is also the opportunity to convert ammonia back to hydrogen, where it can be used to power hydrogen fuel cells or directly within high-temperature fuel cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Giddey|first1=S.|last2=Badwal|first2=S.

Ammonia engines or ammonia motors, using ammonia as a [[working fluid]], have been proposed and occasionally used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web 
  |author=Douglas Self 
  |authorlink=Douglas Self 
  |url=http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/POWER/ammonia/ammonia.htm |title=Ammonia Motors |date=1 October 2007  |accessdate=28 November 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is similar to that used in a [[fireless locomotive]], but with ammonia as the working fluid, instead of steam or compressed air. Ammonia engines were used experimentally in the 19th century by [[Goldsworthy Gurney]] in the UK and the [[St. Charles Avenue Streetcar]] line in New Orleans in the 1870s and 1880s,&lt;ref name="The Streetcars of New Orleans"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Streetcars of New Orleans |author=Louis C. Hennick |author2=Elbridge Harper Charlton |date = 1965 |issue = |volume = |publisher =Pelican Publishing |isbn=9781455612598 |pages =14–16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and during [[World War II]] ammonia was used to power buses in Belgium.&lt;ref name=c1/&gt;

Ammonia is sometimes proposed as a practical alternative to [[fossil fuel]] for [[internal combustion engine]]s.&lt;ref name=c1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.energy.iastate.edu/Renewable/ammonia/ammonia/2007/Olson2_NH3.pdf |title=Ammonia as a Transportation Fuel IV |date=15–16 October 2007 |publisher=Norm Olson – Iowa Energy Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207092554/http://www.energy.iastate.edu/Renewable/ammonia/ammonia/2007/Olson2_NH3.pdf |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its high [[octane rating]] of 120&lt;ref name="Chemistry department, University of Bristol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chm.bris.ac.uk/motm/ammonia/Ammonia%20MOTM.htm|title=Ammonia|publisher=chm.bris.ac.uk|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and low flame temperature allows the use of high compression ratios without a penalty of high NOx production.&amp;nbsp; Since ammonia contains no carbon, its combustion cannot produce carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons or soot.

However ammonia cannot be easily used in existing [[Otto cycle]] engines because of its very narrow [[Ammonia#Combustion|flammability range]], and there are also other barriers to widespread automobile usage.  In terms of raw ammonia supplies, plants would have to be built to increase production levels, requiring significant capital and energy sources.  Although it is the second most produced chemical, the scale of ammonia production is a small fraction of world petroleum usage.  It could be manufactured from renewable energy sources, as well as coal or nuclear power. The 60 MW [[Norsk Hydro Rjukan|Rjukan dam]] in [[Telemark]], Norway produced ammonia for many years from 1913, providing fertilizer for much of Europe.

Despite this, several tests have been done. In 1981, a Canadian company converted a 1981 Chevrolet Impala to operate using ammonia as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|L0hBAz6MxC4|Ammonia Powered Car}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gregvezina.ca |title=Watch 'Ammonia Fuel'|accessdate=7 July 2009|publisher=Greg Vezina}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a University of Michigan pickup powered by ammonia drove from Detroit to San Francisco as part of a demonstration, requiring only one fill-up in Wyoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nh3car.com/|title=Welcome to NH3 Car|work=NH3Car.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to [[hydrogen as a fuel]], ammonia is much more energy efficient, and hydrogen could be produced, stored, and delivered at a much lower cost as ammonia rather than as compressed and/or cryogenic hydrogen.&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt; The conversion of ammonia to hydrogen via the sodium-amide process,&lt;ref name="American Chemical Society"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=David|first=William I.

Conversion to hydrogen would allow the storage of hydrogen at nearly 18 wt% compared to ~5% for gaseous hydrogen under pressure.

Rocket engines have also been fueled by ammonia. The [[Reaction Motors XLR99]] rocket engine that powered the {{nowrap|[[X-15]]}} hypersonic research aircraft used liquid ammonia. Although not as powerful as other fuels, it left no soot in the reusable rocket engine, and its density approximately matches the density of the oxidizer, liquid oxygen, which simplified the aircraft's design.

====As a stimulant====
[[File:Meth ammonia tank Otley iowa.JPG|thumb|Anti-[[methamphetamine|meth]] sign on tank of anhydrous ammonia, [[Otley, Iowa]]. Anhydrous ammonia is a common farm fertilizer that is also a critical ingredient in making methamphetamine. In 2005, Iowa used grant money to give out thousands of locks to prevent criminals from getting into the tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thegazette.com/2009/10/06/anhydrous-ammonia-tank-locks-have-flaws |title=Anhydrous ammonia tank locks have flaws|author=The Gazette Staff|newspaper=Cedar Rapids Gazette|date=6 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Ammonia, as the vapor released by [[smelling salts]], has found significant use as a respiratory stimulant.  Ammonia is commonly used in the illegal manufacture of [[methamphetamine]] through a [[Birch reduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/methnet/understandingmeth/basics.html |title=Illinois Attorney General &amp;#124; Basic Understanding Of Meth |publisher=Illinoisattorneygeneral.gov |accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Birch method of making methamphetamine is dangerous because the alkali metal and liquid ammonia are both extremely reactive, and the temperature of liquid ammonia makes it susceptible to explosive boiling when reactants are added.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NnZ23IqU4SoC&amp;pg=PA759&amp;lpg=PA759&amp;dq=ammonia+birch+method+danger&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Di9oxSFGO9&amp;sig=EeM1TNcWDbgY606dsTcn4H8rmnk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-ue6Twd_YAhXmSN8KHdSmDQ4Q6AEIZjAN#v=onepage&amp;q=ammonia%20birch%20method%20danger&amp;f=false|title=Occupational, Industrial, and Environmental Toxicology|last=Greenberg|first=Michael I.|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0323013406|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Textile====
Liquid ammonia is used for treatment of cotton materials, giving properties like [[mercerisation]], using alkalis. In particular, it is used for prewashing of wool.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Włochowicz|first1=A.|last2=Stelmasiak|first2=E.|title=Change in thermal properties of wool after treatment with liquid ammonia|journal=Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry|volume=26|issue=1|year=1983|page=17|doi=10.1007/BF01914084}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Lifting gas====
At standard temperature and pressure, ammonia is less dense than atmosphere and has approximately 45-48% of the lifting power of hydrogen or [[helium]]. Ammonia has sometimes been used to fill weather balloons as a [[lifting gas]]. Because of its relatively high boiling point (compared to helium and hydrogen), ammonia could potentially be refrigerated and liquefied aboard an [[airship]] to reduce lift and add ballast (and returned to a gas to add lift and reduce ballast).

====Woodworking====
{{see also|Ammonia fuming}}
Ammonia has been used to darken quartersawn white oak in Arts &amp; Crafts and Mission-style furniture. Ammonia fumes react with the natural tannins in the wood and cause it to change colours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodweb.com/knowledge_base/Fuming_white_oak.html Fuming white oak]. woodweb.com&lt;/ref&gt;

====Energy carrier====
Ammonia can be manufactured from solar energy, air and water. This is an efficient way to package hydrogen into a chemical that is much cheaper to store and transport than pure hydrogen be it as gas or as liquid. In fact, per volume ammonia holds more hydrogen than does liquid hydrogen. Ammonia may be the key to overcome not only the daily but also the seasonal fluctuations of renewable energy sources.

This approach will solve many of the problems foreseen for the proposed [[Hydrogen economy]], that instead could be replaced by an Ammonia economy, essentially still a hydrogen economy.

In early August 2018, scientists from [[Australia]]’s [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) announced the success of developing a process to release hydrogen from ammonia and harvest that at ultra-high purity as a fuel for cars. This uses a special membrane. Two demonstration [[fuel cell vehicle]]s have the technology, a [[Hyundai Nexo]] and [[Toyota Mirai]].&lt;ref name="2018-08-08_ABC"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-08/hydrogen-fuel-breakthrough-csiro-game-changer-export-potential/10082514  'Carbon-free fuel': Australian hydrogen car breakthrough could go global], Lexy Hamilton-Smith, [[ABC News Online]], 2018-08-08&lt;/ref&gt;

Small-scale, intermittent production of ammonia, for local agricultural use, may be a viable substitute for electrical grid attachment as a sink for power generated by wind turbines in isolated rural installations.

==Safety precautions==
[[File:Ammiakoprovod NS.jpg|thumb|The world's longest ammonia [[pipeline transport|pipeline]], running from the [[TogliattiAzot]] plant in [[Russia]] to [[Odessa]] in [[Ukraine]].]]
The U. S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)]] has set a 15-minute exposure limit for gaseous ammonia of 35 ppm by volume in the environmental air and an 8-hour exposure limit of 25 ppm by volume.&lt;ref name=ToxFaqSheet&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/tfacts126.pdf |title=Toxic FAQ Sheet for Ammonia| publisher=[[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]] (ATSDR)|date= September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; NIOSH recently reduced the IDLH from 500 to 300 based on recent more conservative interpretations of original research in 1943. IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health) is the level to which a healthy worker can be exposed for 30 minutes without suffering irreversible health effects. Other organizations have varying exposure levels. U.S. Navy Standards [U.S. Bureau of Ships 1962] maximum allowable concentrations (MACs):continuous exposure (60 days): 25 ppm / 1 hour: 400 ppm&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/idlh/7664417.html Ammonia], IDLH Documentation&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonia vapour has a sharp, irritating, pungent odour that acts as a warning of potentially dangerous exposure. The average odour threshold is 5 ppm, well below any danger or damage. Exposure to very high concentrations of gaseous ammonia can result in lung damage and death.&lt;ref name=ToxFaqSheet/&gt; Although ammonia is regulated in the United States as a non-flammable gas, it still meets the definition of a material that is toxic by inhalation and requires a hazardous safety permit when transported in quantities greater than 13,248 L (3,500 gallons).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/faq/anhydrous-ammonia-covered-under-hazardous-materials-safety-permit-program Is Anhydrous Ammonia covered under the Hazardous Materials Safety Permit Program?] from the website of the [[United States Department of Transportation]] (DOT)&lt;/ref&gt; Household products containing ammonia (i.e., [[Windex]]) should never be used in conjunction with products containing bleach, as the resulting chemical reaction produces highly toxic fumes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chemistry.about.com/od/toxicchemicals/a/Mixing-Bleach-And-Ammonia.htm|title=Why You Shouldn't Mix Bleach and Ammonia|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liquid ammonia is dangerous because it is [[hygroscopic]] and because it can freeze flesh. See [[Gas carrier#Health effects of specific cargoes carried on gas carriers]] for more information.

===Toxicity===
The toxicity of ammonia solutions does not usually cause problems for humans and other mammals, as a specific mechanism exists to prevent its build-up in the bloodstream. Ammonia is converted to [[carbamoyl phosphate]] by the enzyme [[carbamoyl phosphate synthetase]], and then enters the [[urea cycle]] to be either incorporated into [[amino acid]]s or excreted in the urine.&lt;ref name="Ammonium Ion Is Converted Into Urea in Most Terrestrial Vertebrates"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berg|first1=JM|last2=Tymoczko|first2=JL|last3=Stryer|first3=L|title=Biochemistry|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22450/|edition=5th|year=2002|section=23.4|}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fish]] and [[amphibian]]s lack this mechanism, as they can usually eliminate ammonia from their bodies by direct excretion. Ammonia even at dilute concentrations is highly toxic to aquatic animals, and for this reason it is [[Directive 67/548/EEC|classified]] as ''dangerous for the environment''.

Ammonia is a constituent of [[tobacco smoke]].&lt;ref name="TalhoutSchulz2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Talhout|first1=Reinskje|last2=Schulz|first2=Thomas|last3=Florek|first3=Ewa|last4=Van Benthem|first4=Jan|last5=Wester|first5=Piet|last6=Opperhuizen|first6=Antoon|title=Hazardous Compounds in Tobacco Smoke|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=8|issue=12|year=2011|pages=613–628|issn=1660-4601|doi=10.3390/ijerph8020613|pmid=21556207|pmc=3084482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Coking wastewater ====
Ammonia is present in coking wastewater streams, as a liquid by-product of the production of [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] from [[coal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cutting-Edge Solutions For Coking Wastewater Reuse To Meet The Standard Of Circulation Cooling Systems|url = http://www.wateronline.com/doc/cutting-edge-solutions-for-coking-wastewater-reuse-to-meet-the-standard-of-circulation-cooling-systems-0001|website = www.wateronline.com|access-date = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the ammonia is discharged to the [[marine environment]] where it acts as a pollutant. The [[Whyalla steelworks]] in [[South Australia]] is one example of a coke-producing facility which discharges ammonia into marine waters.&lt;ref name="RajaramDutta2005"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vasudevan Rajaram|author2=Subijoy Dutta|author3=Krishna Parameswaran|title=Sustainable Mining Practices: A Global Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5uTM2jFMzH4C&amp;pg=PA113|date=30 June 2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-3423-7|pages=113–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Aquaculture ====
Ammonia toxicity is believed to be a cause of otherwise unexplained losses in fish hatcheries. Excess ammonia may accumulate and cause alteration of metabolism or increases in the body pH of the exposed organism. Tolerance varies among fish species.&lt;ref name="Water Research"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.water-research.net/index.php/ammonia-in-groundwater-runoff-and-streams|title = Ammonia in Groundwater, Runoff, and Streams|date = |accessdate = 3 December 2014|website = The Water Centre|publisher = |last = Oram|first = Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At lower concentrations, around 0.05&amp;nbsp;mg/L, un-ionised ammonia is harmful to fish species and can result in poor growth and feed conversion rates, reduced fecundity and fertility and increase stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections and diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Managing ammonia in fish ponds|last = Hargreaves|first = J.A.|publisher = Southern Regional Aquaculture Center|year = 2004|isbn = |location = |pages = |last2 = Tucker|first2 = C.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposed to excess ammonia, fish may suffer loss of equilibrium, hyper-excitability, increased respiratory activity and oxygen uptake and increased heart rate.&lt;ref name="Water Research" /&gt; At concentrations exceeding 2.0&amp;nbsp;mg/L, ammonia causes gill and tissue damage, extreme lethargy, convulsions, coma, and death.&lt;ref name="Water Research" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sergeant"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.pollutionsolutions-online.com/articles/water-wastewater/17/chris_sergeant/the_management_of_ammonia_levels_in_an_aquaculture_environment/1557/|title = The Management of Ammonia Levels in an Aquaculture Environment|last = Sergeant|first = Chris|date = 5 February 2014|journal = Water/Wastewater|access-date = 3 December 2014|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments have shown that the lethal concentration for a variety of fish species ranges from 0.2 to 2.0&amp;nbsp;mg/l.&lt;ref name="Sergeant" /&gt;

During winter, when reduced feeds are administered to aquaculture stock, ammonia levels can be higher. Lower ambient temperatures reduce the rate of algal photosynthesis so less ammonia is removed by any algae present. Within an aquaculture environment, especially at large scale, there is no fast-acting remedy to elevated ammonia levels. Prevention rather than correction is recommended to reduce harm to farmed fish&lt;ref name="Sergeant" /&gt; and in open water systems, the surrounding environment.

===Storage information===
Similar to [[propane]], [[anhydrous]] ammonia boils below room temperature when at atmospheric pressure. A storage vessel capable of {{convert|250|psi|MPa|abbr=on|lk=on}} is suitable to contain the liquid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=3a1341f81fbe762466a07d33da2361fb;rgn=div8;view=text;node=29%3A5.1.1.1.8.8.33.11;idno=29;cc=ecfr Electronic Code of Federal Regulations:]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104165051/http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr%3Bsid%3D3a1341f81fbe762466a07d33da2361fb%3Brgn%3Ddiv8%3Bview%3Dtext%3Bnode%3D29%3A5.1.1.1.8.8.33.11%3Bidno%3D29%3Bcc%3Decfr |date=4 November 2011 }}.

Retrieved on 22 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonium compounds should never be allowed to come in contact with [[base (chemistry)|bases]] (unless in an intended and contained reaction), as dangerous quantities of ammonia gas could be released.

===Household use===
Solutions of ammonia (5–10% by weight) are used as household cleaners, particularly for glass. These solutions are irritating to the eyes and [[mucous membrane]]s (respiratory and digestive tracts), and to a lesser extent the skin. Caution should be used that the chemical is never mixed into any liquid containing bleach, as a poisonous gas may result. Mixing with [[chlorine]]-containing products or strong oxidants, such as household [[bleach]], can lead to hazardous compounds such as [[chloramine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last =Rizk-Ouaini|first =Rosette |author2=Ferriol, Michel |author3=Gazet, Josette |author4=Saugier-Cohen Adad |author5=Marie Therese |title = Oxidation reaction of ammonia with sodium hypochlorite.

===Laboratory use of ammonia solutions===

The hazards of ammonia solutions depend on the concentration: "dilute" ammonia solutions are usually 5–10% by weight (&lt;5.62&amp;nbsp;mol/L); "concentrated" solutions are usually prepared at &gt;25% by weight. A 25% (by weight) solution has a density of 0.907 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and a solution that has a lower density will be more concentrated. The [[Directive 67/548/EEC|European Union classification]] of ammonia solutions is given in the table.

The ammonia vapour from concentrated ammonia solutions is severely irritating to the eyes and the respiratory tract, and these solutions should only be handled in a fume hood. Saturated ("0.880" — see [[#Properties]]) solutions can develop a significant pressure inside a closed bottle in warm weather, and the bottle should be opened with care; this is not usually a problem for 25% ("0.900") solutions.

Ammonia solutions should not be mixed with [[halogen]]s, as toxic and/or explosive products are formed. Prolonged contact of ammonia solutions with [[silver]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]] or [[iodide]] salts can also lead to explosive products: such mixtures are often formed in [[qualitative inorganic analysis]], and should be lightly acidified but not concentrated (&lt;6% w/v) before disposal once the test is completed.

===Laboratory use of anhydrous ammonia (gas or liquid)===
&lt;!-- EU index no. 007-001-00-5 --&gt;

Anhydrous ammonia is classified as toxic ('''T''') and dangerous for the environment ('''N'''). The gas is flammable ([[autoignition temperature]]: 651&amp;nbsp;°C) and can form explosive mixtures with air (16–25%). The [[permissible exposure limit]] (PEL) in the United States is 50&amp;nbsp;[[Parts per million|ppm]] (35&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), while the [[IDLH]] concentration is estimated at 300&amp;nbsp;ppm. Repeated exposure to ammonia lowers the sensitivity to the smell of the gas: normally the odour is detectable at concentrations of less than 50&amp;nbsp;ppm, but desensitised individuals may not detect it even at concentrations of 100&amp;nbsp;ppm. Anhydrous ammonia corrodes [[copper]]- and [[zinc]]-containing [[alloy]]s, and so [[brass]] fittings should not be used for handling the gas. Liquid ammonia can also attack [[rubber]] and certain plastics.

Ammonia reacts violently with the halogens. [[Nitrogen triiodide]], a [[primary explosive|primary]] [[high explosive]], is formed when ammonia comes in contact with [[iodine]]. Ammonia causes the explosive [[polymerisation]] of [[ethylene oxide]]. It also forms explosive [[fulminating]] compounds with compounds of [[gold]], [[silver]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[germanium]] or [[tellurium]], and with [[stibine]]. Violent reactions have also been reported with [[acetaldehyde]], [[hypochlorite]] solutions, [[potassium ferricyanide]] and [[peroxide]]s.

==Synthesis and production==

{{See also|Haber process}}
[[File:Production of ammonia.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|right|Production trend of ammonia between 1947 and 2007]]
Because of its many uses, ammonia is one of the most highly produced inorganic chemicals. Dozens of [[chemical plant]]s worldwide produce ammonia. Consuming more than 1% of all man-made power, [[ammonia production]] is a significant component of the world energy budget.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; The USGS reports global ammonia production in 2014 was 176 million tonnes.&lt;ref name="USGS2016"/&gt; China accounted for 32.6% of that (increasingly from coal as part of [[urea]] synthesis), followed by Russia at 8.1%, India at 7.6%, and the United States at 6.4%.&lt;ref name="USGS2016"/&gt; About 88% of the ammonia produced was used for fertilizing agricultural crops.&lt;ref name="USGS2016"/&gt; As of 2012 the global production of ammonia produced from natural gas using the steam reforming process was 72 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ietd.iipnetwork.org/content/ammonia|title=Ammonia|date=2013-04-30|work=Industrial Efficiency Technology &amp; Measures|access-date=2018-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the start of [[World War I]], most ammonia was obtained by the [[dry distillation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=7 July 2009|url=http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1918/press.html |title=Nobel Prize in Chemistry (1918) – Haber-Bosch process}}&lt;/ref&gt; of nitrogenous vegetable and animal waste products, including [[camel]] [[manure|dung]], where it was [[distillation|distilled]] by the reduction of [[nitrous acid]] and [[nitrite]]s with hydrogen; in addition, it was produced by the distillation of [[coal]], and also by the decomposition of ammonium salts by [[alkaline]] hydroxides&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=7 July 2009|title=Chemistry of the Group 2 Elements – Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ra|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1002934|publisher= BBC.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[calcium oxide|quicklime]], the salt most generally used being the chloride ([[sal ammoniac]]) thus:{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=861}}

:2 NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl + 2 CaO → [[Calcium chloride|CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3([[Gas|g]])&lt;/sub&gt;

Hydrogen for ammonia synthesis could also be produced economically by using the [[water gas]] reaction followed by the [[water gas shift]] reaction, produced by passing steam through red-hot [[coke (fuel)|coke]], to give a mixture of hydrogen and carbon dioxide gases, followed by removal of the carbon dioxide "washing" the gas mixture with water under pressure ({{convert|25|atm|kPa|lk=on}});&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Parkes |first1=G. D. |last2=Mellor |first2=J. W. |title=Mellor's Modern Inorganic Chemistry |edition=New Edition, Revised and Rewritten |year=1939 |publisher=Longmans, Green and Co |location=London |pages=255–256 &amp; 362}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by using other sources like coal or coke gasification.

Modern ammonia-producing plants depend on industrial [[hydrogen production]] to react with atmospheric nitrogen using a [[magnetite]] [[catalyst]] or over a promoted Fe catalyst under high pressure ({{convert|100|atm}}) and temperature (450&amp;nbsp;°C) to form anhydrous liquid ammonia. This step is known as the ammonia synthesis loop (also referred to as the [[Haber process|Haber–Bosch process]]):&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, P.W.; Overton, T.L.; Rourke, J.P.; Weller, M.T. and Armstrong, F.A. (2010) [https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B4Ka5HSSrR_yeENFS0hvbjdUR00/view ''Shriver and Atkins Inorganic Chemistry'']. 5th Edi. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York. p. 383. {{ISBN|978-1-42-921820-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3([[Gas|g]])&lt;/sub&gt;

Hydrogen required for ammonia synthesis could also be produced economically using other sources like coal or coke gasification or less economically from the electrolysis of water into oxygen + hydrogen and other alternatives that are presently impractical for large scale.
At one time, most of Europe's ammonia was produced from the Hydro plant at [[Vemork]], via the electrolysis route. Various renewable energy electricity sources are also potentially applicable.

As a sustainable alternative to the relatively inefficient [[electrolysis]], hydrogen can be generated from organic wastes (such as biomass or food-industry waste) using [[catalytic reforming]]. This releases hydrogen from carbonaceous substances at only 10–20% of energy used by electrolysis and may lead to hydrogen being produced from municipal wastes at below zero cost (allowing for the tipping fees and efficient catalytic reforming, such as cold-plasma). Catalytic (thermal) reforming is possible in small, distributed (even mobile) plants, to take advantage of low-value, stranded biomass/biowaste or natural gas deposits. Conversion of such wastes into ammonia solves the problem of hydrogen storage, as hydrogen can be released economically from ammonia on-demand, without the need for high-pressure or cryogenic storage.

It is also easier to store ammonia onboard vehicles than to store hydrogen, as ammonia is less flammable than petrol or LPG.

In 2012, Masaaki Kitano (and 9 co-authors), working with an organic ruthenium catalyst, demonstrated "Ammonia Synthesis Using a Stable Electride as an Electron Donor and Reversible Hydrogen Store".&lt;ref&gt;{doi = 10.1038/nchem.1476}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, Yutong Gong (and 12 co-authors) demonstrated "Ternary intermetallic LaCoSi as a catalyst for N2 activation"&lt;ref&gt;{doi = 10.1038/s41929-017-0022-0}&lt;/ref&gt;, an equally efficient production process not dependent on rare metal. In July 2018, Xiaoqian Wang (and 14 co-authors) demonstrated "Atomically dispersed Au 1 catalyst towards efficient electrochemical synthesis of ammonia"&lt;ref&gt;{doi = 10.1016/j.scib.2018.07.005}&lt;/ref&gt;, an even more efficient process.

For small scale laboratory synthesis, one can heat [[urea]] and Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:(NH2)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO + Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

==Liquid ammonia as a solvent==
{{See also|Inorganic nonaqueous solvent}}
Liquid ammonia is the best-known and most widely studied nonaqueous ionising solvent. Its most conspicuous property is its ability to dissolve alkali metals to form highly coloured, electrically conductive solutions containing [[solvated electron]]s. Apart from these remarkable solutions, much of the chemistry in liquid ammonia can be classified by analogy with related reactions in aqueous solutions. Comparison of the physical properties of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with those of water shows NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has the lower melting point, boiling point, density, [[viscosity]], [[dielectric constant]] and [[electrical conductivity]]; this is due at least in part to the weaker hydrogen bonding in NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and because such bonding cannot form cross-linked networks, since each NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecule has only one lone pair of electrons compared with two for each H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule. The ionic self-[[dissociation constant]] of liquid NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at −50&amp;nbsp;°C is about 10&lt;sup&gt;−33&lt;/sup&gt; mol&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·l&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Liquid ammonia is an ionising solvent, although less so than water, and dissolves a range of ionic compounds, including many [[nitrate]]s, [[nitrite]]s, [[cyanide]]s, [[thiocyanate]]s, [[Cyclopentadienyl complex|metal cyclopentadienyl complexes]] and [[metal bis(trimethylsilyl)amides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Neufeld, R.|author2=Michel, R. |author3=Herbst-Irmer, R. |author4=Schöne, R. |author5=Stalke, D. |journal=[[Chem.

The solubility of [[halide]] salts increases from [[fluoride]] to [[iodide]]. A saturated solution of [[ammonium nitrate]] ('''Divers' solution''', named after [[Edward Divers]]) contains 0.83&amp;nbsp;mol solute per mole of ammonia and has a [[vapour pressure]] of less than 1&amp;nbsp;bar even at {{convert|25|C|0|abbr=on}}.

===Solutions of metals===
{{See also|Solvated electron}}
Liquid ammonia will dissolve the [[alkali metal]]s and other [[Electronegativity|electropositive]] metals such as [[magnesium]], [[calcium]], [[strontium]], [[barium]], [[europium]] and [[ytterbium]]. At low concentrations (&lt;0.06&amp;nbsp;mol/l), deep blue solutions are formed: these contain metal cations and [[solvated electron]]s, free electrons that are surrounded by a cage of ammonia molecules.

These solutions are very useful as strong reducing agents. At higher concentrations, the solutions are metallic in appearance and in electrical conductivity. At low temperatures, the two types of solution can coexist as [[Wiktionary:immiscible|immiscible]] phases.

The range of thermodynamic stability of liquid ammonia solutions is very narrow, as the potential for oxidation to dinitrogen, [[Standard electrode potential|''E''°]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 6e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ⇌ 8NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), is only +0.04&amp;nbsp;V. In practice, both oxidation to dinitrogen and reduction to dihydrogen are slow. This is particularly true of reducing solutions: the solutions of the alkali metals mentioned above are stable for several days, slowly decomposing to the [[Amide|metal amide]] and dihydrogen. Most studies involving liquid ammonia solutions are done in reducing conditions; although oxidation of liquid ammonia is usually slow, there is still a risk of explosion, particularly if transition metal ions are present as possible catalysts.

==Ammonia's role in biological systems and human disease==
[[File:Symptoms of hyperammonemia.svg|thumb|upright=1.15|Main symptoms of hyperammonemia (ammonia reaching toxic concentrations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/944996-overview |title=eMedicine Specialties &gt; Metabolic Diseases &gt; Hyperammonemia|author= Roth, Karl S. |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Ammonia is both a [[metabolic waste]] and a metabolic input throughout the [[biosphere]]. It is an important source of nitrogen for living systems. Although atmospheric nitrogen abounds (more than 75%), few living creatures are capable of using this atmospheric nitrogen in its diatomic form, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas. Therefore, [[nitrogen fixation]] is required for the synthesis of amino acids, which are the building blocks of [[protein]]. Some plants rely on ammonia and other nitrogenous wastes incorporated into the soil by decaying matter. Others, such as nitrogen-fixing [[legume]]s, benefit from [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationships with [[rhizobia]] that create ammonia from atmospheric nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Adjei, M. B. |author2=Quesenberry, K. H. |author3=Chamblis, C. G. |title=Nitrogen Fixation and Inoculation of Forage Legumes|url=http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/AG152 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070520075000/http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/AG152 |archivedate=20 May 2007 |publisher=University of Florida IFAS Extension|date=June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biosynthesis===
In certain organisms, ammonia is produced from atmospheric nitrogen by [[enzyme]]s called [[nitrogenase]]s. The overall process is called [[nitrogen fixation]]. Intense effort has been directed toward understanding the mechanism of biological nitrogen fixation; the scientific interest in this problem is motivated by the unusual structure of the active site of the enzyme, which consists of an Fe&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;MoS&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Igarashi|first1=Robert Y.|last2=Laryukhin|first2=Mikhail|last3=Dos Santos|first3=Patricia C.|last4=Lee|first4=Hong-In|last5=Dean|first5=Dennis R.|last6=Seefeldt|first6=Lance C.|last7=Hoffman|first7=Brian M.|title=Trapping H- Bound to the Nitrogenase FeMo-Cofactor Active Site during H2 Evolution: Characterization by ENDOR Spectroscopy|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=May 2005|volume=127|issue=17|pages=6231–6241|doi=10.1021/ja043596p}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia is also a metabolic product of [[amino acid]] [[deamination]] catalyzed by enzymes such as [[Glutamate dehydrogenase 1#Function|glutamate dehydrogenase 1]]. Ammonia excretion is common in aquatic animals. In humans, it is quickly converted to [[urea]], which is much less toxic, particularly less [[#Basicity|basic]]. This urea is a major component of the dry weight of [[urine]]. Most reptiles, birds, insects, and snails excrete [[uric acid]] solely as nitrogenous waste.

===In physiology===
Ammonia also plays a role in both normal and abnormal animal [[physiology]]. It is biosynthesised through normal amino acid metabolism and is toxic in high concentrations. The [[liver]] converts ammonia to urea through a series of reactions known as the [[urea cycle]]. Liver dysfunction, such as that seen in [[cirrhosis]], may lead to elevated amounts of ammonia in the blood ([[hyperammonemia]]). Likewise, defects in the enzymes responsible for the urea cycle, such as [[ornithine transcarbamylase]], lead to hyperammonemia. Hyperammonemia contributes to the confusion and [[coma]] of [[hepatic encephalopathy]], as well as the neurologic disease common in people with urea cycle defects and [[organic aciduria]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Zschocke, Johannes |author2=Hoffman, Georg |title=Vademecum Metabolism|publisher= Schattauer Verlag|year= 2004|isbn=3794523857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia is important for normal animal acid/base balance. After formation of ammonium from [[glutamine]], [[α-ketoglutarate]] may be degraded to produce two molecules of [[bicarbonate]], which are then available as buffers for dietary acids. Ammonium is excreted in the urine, resulting in net acid loss. Ammonia may itself diffuse across the renal tubules, combine with a hydrogen ion, and thus allow for further acid excretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rose, Burton |author2=Helmut Rennke|title=Renal Pathophysiology|location=Baltimore |publisher=Williams &amp; Wilkins|year= 1994|isbn=0-683-07354-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Excretion===
{{Main|Excretion}}
Ammonium ions are a [[Toxicity|toxic]] waste product of [[metabolism]] in [[animal]]s. In fish and aquatic invertebrates, it is excreted directly into the water. In mammals, sharks, and amphibians, it is converted in the [[urea cycle]] to [[urea]], because it is less toxic and can be stored more efficiently. In birds, reptiles, and terrestrial snails, metabolic ammonium is converted into [[uric acid]], which is solid, and can therefore be excreted with minimal water loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Neil A. |authorlink=Neil Campbell (scientist) |author2=[[Jane Reece|Jane B.

===Interstellar space===
Ammonia was first detected in interstellar space in 1968, based on [[microwave]] emissions from the direction of the [[Milky Way|galactic core]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cheung, A.

The sensitivity of the molecule to a broad range of excitations and the ease with which it can be observed in a number of regions has made ammonia one of the most important molecules for studies of [[molecular cloud]]s.&lt;ref name=ho&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ho, P.

The following isotopic species of ammonia have been detected:

The detection of triply [[deuterium|deuterated]] ammonia was considered a surprise as deuterium is relatively scarce. It is thought that the low-temperature conditions allow this molecule to survive and accumulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Millar, T. J.|title=Deuterium Fractionation in Interstellar Clouds|journal=Space Science Reviews|volume= 106|issue=1|pages=73–86|doi=10.1023/A:1024677318645|year=2003|bibcode = 2003SSRv..106...73M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its interstellar discovery, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has proved to be an invaluable spectroscopic tool in the study of the interstellar medium. With a large number of transitions sensitive to a wide range of excitation conditions, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has been widely astronomically detected – its detection has been reported in hundreds of journal articles. Listed below is a sample of journal articles that highlights the range of detectors that have been used to identify ammonia.

The study of interstellar ammonia has been important to a number of areas of research in the last few decades. Some of these are delineated below and primarily involve using ammonia as an interstellar thermometer.

All other proposed formation reactions have rate constants of between 2 and 13 orders of magnitude smaller, making their contribution to the abundance of ammonia relatively insignificant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://astrochemistry.net |title=astrochemistry.net |publisher=astrochemistry.net |accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an example of the minor contribution other formation reactions play, the reaction:

====Interstellar destruction mechanisms====
There are 113 total proposed reactions leading to the destruction of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Of these, 39 were tabulated in extensive tables of the chemistry among C, N, and O compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1980ApJS...43....1P|author1=Prasad, S. S.  |author2=Huntress, W.

This is due to the relatively high abundance of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

====Single antenna detections====
Radio observations of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from the [[Effelsberg 100-m Radio Telescope]] reveal that the ammonia line is separated into two components – a background ridge and an unresolved core. The background corresponds well with the locations previously detected CO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Wilson, T. L. |author2=Downes, D. |author3=Bieging, J. |year=1979|journal= Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume= 71|page= 275 |bibcode=1979A&amp;A....71..275W|title=Ammonia in Orion }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 25 m Chilbolton telescope in England detected radio signatures of ammonia in [[H II region]]s, HNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O [[maser]]s, H-H objects, and other objects associated with star formation. A comparison of emission line widths indicates that turbulent or systematic velocities do not increase in the central cores of molecular clouds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=MacDonald, G. H. |author2=Little, L. T. |author3=Brown, A. T. |author4=Riley, P. W. |author5=Matheson, D.

Microwave radiation from ammonia was observed in several galactic objects including W3(OH), [[Orion (constellation)|Orion A]], W43, W51, and five sources in the galactic centre. The high detection rate indicates that this is a common molecule in the interstellar medium and that high-density regions are common in the galaxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Morris, M., Zuckerman, B., Palmer, P., Turner, B. E. |year=1973|journal= Astrophysical Journal|volume= 186|page= 501 |bibcode=1973ApJ...186..501M|doi=10.1086/152515|title=Interstellar ammonia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interferometric studies====
[[Very Large Array|VLA]] observations of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in seven regions with high-velocity gaseous outflows revealed condensations of less than 0.1 [[Parsec|pc]] in L1551, S140, and [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus A]]. Three individual condensations were detected in Cepheus A, one of them with a highly elongated shape. They may play an important role in creating the bipolar outflow in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Torrelles, J. M., Ho, P. T. P., Rodriguez, L. F., Canto, J. |year=1985|journal= Astrophysical Journal|volume= 288|page= 595 |bibcode=1985ApJ...288..595T|doi=10.1086/162825|title=VLA observations of ammonia and continuum in regions with high-velocity gaseous outflows}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extragalactic ammonia was imaged using the VLA in [[IC 342]]. The hot gas has temperatures above 70 K, which was inferred from ammonia line ratios and appears to be closely associated with the innermost portions of the nuclear bar seen in CO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Ho, P. T. P., Martin, R. N., Turner, J. L., Jackson, J.

Based upon temperature and density diagnostics, it is concluded that in general such clumps are probably the sites of massive star formation in an early evolutionary phase prior to the development of an ultracompact HII region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Cesaroni, R., Churchwell, E., Hofner, P., Walmsley, C.

====Infrared detections====
Absorption at 2.97 micrometres due to solid ammonia was recorded from interstellar grains in the [[Becklin-Neugebauer Object]] and probably in NGC 2264-IR as well. This detection helped explain the physical shape of previously poorly understood and related ice absorption lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Knacke, R. F., McCorkle, S., Puetter, R. C., Erickson, E. F., Kraetschmer, W. |year=1982|journal= Astrophysical Journal|volume= 260|page= 141|bibcode=1982ApJ...260..141K|doi=10.1086/160241|title=Observation of interstellar ammonia ice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spectrum of the disk of Jupiter was obtained from the [[Kuiper Airborne Observatory]], covering the 100 to 300&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; spectral range. Analysis of the spectrum provides information on global mean properties of ammonia gas and an ammonia ice haze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Orton, G. S., Aumann, H. H., Martonchik, J. V., Appleby, J. F. |year=1982|journal= Icarus|volume= 52|issue=1|page= 81 |bibcode=1982Icar...52...81O|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(82)90170-1|title=Airborne spectroscopy of Jupiter in the 100- to 300-cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; region: Global properties of ammonia gas and ice haze}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 149 dark cloud positions were surveyed for evidence of 'dense cores' by using the (J,K) = (1,1) rotating inversion line of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In general, the cores are not spherically shaped, with aspect ratios ranging from 1.1 to 4.4. It is also found that cores with stars have broader lines than cores without stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Benson, P. J. |author2=Myers, P. |year=1989|journal= Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series|volume= 71|page= 89 |bibcode=1989ApJS...71...89B|doi=10.1086/191365|title=A survey for dense cores in dark clouds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ammonia has been detected in the [[Draco (constellation)|Draco Nebula]] and in one or possibly two molecular clouds, which are associated with the high-latitude galactic [[infrared cirrus]]. The finding is significant because they may represent the birthplaces for the Population I metallicity B-type stars in the galactic halo that could have been borne in the galactic disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Mebold, U., Heithausen, A., Reif, K.|year= 1987|journal= Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume= 180|page= 213|bibcode=1987A&amp;A...180..213M|title=Ammonia in the galactic halo and the infrared cirrus }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Observations of nearby dark clouds====
By balancing and stimulated emission with spontaneous emission, it is possible to construct a relation between [[excitation temperature]] and density. Moreover, since the transitional levels of ammonia can be approximated by a 2-level system at low temperatures, this calculation is fairly simple. This premise can be applied to dark clouds, regions suspected of having extremely low temperatures and possible sites for future star formation. Detections of ammonia in dark clouds show very narrow lines—indicative not only of low temperatures, but also of a low level of inner-cloud turbulence. Line ratio calculations provide a measurement of cloud temperature that is independent of previous CO observations. The ammonia observations were consistent with CO measurements of rotation temperatures of ~10 K. With this, densities can be determined, and have been calculated to range between 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; in dark clouds. Mapping of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; gives typical clouds sizes of 0.1 [[Parsec|pc]] and masses near 1 solar mass. These cold, dense cores are the sites of future star formation.

====UC HII regions====
Ultra-compact HII regions are among the best tracers of high-mass star formation. The dense material surrounding UCHII regions is likely primarily molecular. Since a complete study of massive star formation necessarily involves the cloud from which the star formed, ammonia is an invaluable tool in understanding this surrounding molecular material. Since this molecular material can be spatially resolved, it is possible to constrain the heating/ionising sources, temperatures, masses, and sizes of the regions. Doppler-shifted velocity components allow for the separation of distinct regions of molecular gas that can trace outflows and hot cores originating from forming stars.

====Extragalactic detection====
Ammonia has been detected in external galaxies,&lt;ref&gt;http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1979A%26A....74L...7M&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8197839&lt;/ref&gt; and by simultaneously measuring several lines, it is possible to directly measure the gas temperature in these galaxies. Line ratios imply that gas temperatures are warm (~50 K), originating from dense clouds with sizes of tens of pc. This picture is consistent with the picture within our [[Milky Way]] galaxy—hot dense molecular cores form around newly forming stars embedded in larger clouds of molecular material on the scale of several hundred pc (giant molecular clouds; GMCs).

[[Musicology]] commonly classifies [[scale (music)|scale]]s as either '''hemitonic''' or '''anhemitonic'''. Hemitonic scales contain one or more [[semitone]]s, while anhemitonic scales do not contain semitones. For example, in [[Music of Japan#Traditional music|traditional Japanese music]], the anhemitonic [[yo scale|''yo'' scale]] is contrasted with the hemitonic [[in scale|''in'' scale]].&lt;ref&gt;Anon. (2001) "Ditonus", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]]. London: Macmillan Publishers; [[Bence Szabolcsi]] (1943), "Five-Tone Scales and Civilization", ''Acta Musicologica'' 15, Fasc. 1/4 (January–December): pp. 24–34, citation on p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The simplest and most commonly used scale in the world is the atritonic anhemitonic [[Pentatonic scale#Hemitonic and anhemitonic|"major" pentatonic scale]]. The [[whole tone scale]] is also anhemitonic.

[[Image:Hungarian minor scale on C.png|thumb|right|Hungarian minor scale on C, a cohemitonic scale.&lt;ref name="Kahan"&gt;Kahan, Sylvia (2009). ''In Search of New Scales'', p. 39. {{ISBN|978-1-58046-305-8}}. Cites Liszt. ''Des Bohémians'', p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Hungarian minor scale on C.mid|Play}}]]

A special subclass of the hemitonic scales is the '''cohemitonic''' scales.&lt;ref&gt;Christ, William (1966). ''Materials and Structure of Music'', v.1, p. 39. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice–Hall. LOC 66-14354.&lt;/ref&gt; Cohemitonic scales contain two or more semitones (making them hemitonic) such that two or more of the semitones appear consecutively in scale order.  For example, the [[Hungarian minor scale]] in C includes F{{music|#}}, G, and A{{music|b}} in that order, with a semitone between F{{music|#}} and G, and then a semitone between G and A{{music|b}}.

[[Image:Octatonic scales on C.png|thumb|right|330px|Octatonic scales on C, hemitonic but ancohemitonic {{audio|Octatonic scales on C.mid|Play}}.]]

'''Ancohemitonic''' scales, in contrast, either contain no semitones (and thus are anhemitonic), or contain semitones (being hemitonic) where none of the semitones appear consecutively in scale order.&lt;ref&gt;Tymoczko, Dmitri (1997). "The Consecutive-Semitone Constraint on Scalar Structure: A Link between Impressionism and Jazz", ''Intégral'', v.11, (1997), p. 135-179.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2015}}&lt;!--The term is not found in the cited source.--&gt;  Some authors, however, do not include anhemitonic scales in their definition of ancohemitonic scales.  Examples of ancohemitonic scales are numerous, as ancohemitonia is favored over cohemitonia in the world's musics: [[diatonic scale]], melodic major/[[Melodic minor#Melodic minor scale|melodic minor]], [[Hungarian major scale]], [[harmonic major scale]], [[Harmonic minor#Harmonic minor scale|harmonic minor scale]], and the so-called [[octatonic scale]].

Hemitonia is also quantified by the number of semitones present. Unhemitonic scales have only one semitone; dihemitonic scales have 2 semitones; trihemitonic scales have 3 semitones, etc.  In the same way that an anhemitonic scale is less dissonant than a hemitonic scale, an unhemitonic scale is less dissonant than a dihemitonic scale.

The qualification of cohemitonia versus ancohemitonia combines with the cardinality of semitones, giving terms like: dicohemitonic, triancohemitonic, and so forth.  An ancohemitonic scale is less dissonant than a cohemitonic scale, the count of their semitones being equal.  In general, the number of semitones is more important to the perception of dissonance than the adjacency (or lack thereof) of any pair of them.  Additional adjacency between semitones (once adjacency is present) does not necessarily increase the dissonance, the count of semitones again being equal.&lt;ref name="Keith, Michael 1991. p. 45"&gt;Keith, Michael. 1991. ''From Polychords to Polya : Adventures in Musical Combinatorics'', p. 45. Princeton: Vinculum Press. {{ISBN|978-0963009708}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Related to these semitone classifications are '''tritonic''' and '''atritonic''' scales.  Tritonic scales contain one or more [[tritone]]s, while atritonic scales do not contain tritones.  A special monotonic relationship exists between semitones and tritones as scales are built by projection, q.v. below.

The harmonic relationship of all these categories comes from the perception that semitones and tritones are the severest of [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonances]], and that avoiding them is often desirable.  The most-used scales across the planet are anhemitonic. Of the remaining hemitonic scales, the ones most used are ancohemitonic.

== Quantification of hemitonia and its relationship to ancohemitonia ==
Most of the world's music is anhemitonic, perhaps 90%.&lt;ref name="Keith, Michael 1991. p. 43"&gt;Keith, Michael. 1991. ''From Polychords to Polya : Adventures in Musical Combinatorics'', p. 43. Princeton: Vinculum Press. {{ISBN|978-0963009708}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Of that other hemitonic portion, perhaps 90% is unhemitonic, predominating in chords of only 1 semitone, all of which are ancohemitonic by definition.&lt;ref name="Keith, Michael 1991. p. 43"/&gt; Of the remaining 10%, perhaps 90% are dihemitonic, predominating in chords of no more than 2 semitones.  The same applies to chords of 3 semitones.&lt;ref&gt;Keith, Michael. 1991. ''From Polychords to Polya : Adventures in Musical Combinatorics'', p. 48-49. Princeton: Vinculum Press. {{ISBN|978-0963009708}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In both later cases, however, there is a distinct preference for ancohemitonia, as the lack of adjacency of any two semitones goes a long way towards softening the increasing dissonance.

The following table plots sonority size (downwards on the left) against semitone count (to the right) plus the quality of ancohemitonia (denoted with letter A) versus cohemitonia (denoted with letter C).  In general, ancohemitonic combinations are fewer for a given chord or scale size, but used much more frequently so that their names are well known.

Column "0" represents the most commonly used chords.,&lt;ref name="Keith, Michael 1991. p. 45"/&gt; avoiding intervals of M7 and chromatic 9ths and such combinations of 4th, chromatic 5ths, and 6th to produce semitones.  Column 1 represents chords that barely use the harmonic degrees that column "0" avoids.  Column 2, however, represents sounds far more intractable.&lt;ref name="Keith, Michael 1991. p. 45"/&gt;

Column 0, row 5 are the full but pleasant chords: 9th, 6/9, and 9alt5 with no 7.&lt;ref name="Wilmott, Brett 1994 p.210"&gt;Wilmott, Brett. (1994) ''Mel Bays Complete Book of Harmony Theory and Voicing'', p.210. Pacific, Missouri: Mel Bay. {{ISBN|978-1562229948}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Column "0", row "6", is the unique [[whole tone scale]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.367. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Column "2A", row "7", a local minimum, refers to the [[diatonic scale]] and melodic major/[[Melodic minor#Melodic minor scale|melodic minor]] scales.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.362-363. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ancohemitonia, inter alii, probably makes these scales popular.  Column "2C", row "7", another local minimum, refers to the [[Neapolitan major scale]], which is cohemitonic and somewhat less common but still popular enough to bear a name.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.363. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Column "3A", row "7", another local minimum, represents the [[Hungarian major scale]], and its involution, and the [[harmonic major scale]] and involution [[Harmonic minor#Harmonic minor scale|harmonic minor scale]] of the same.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard.

LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Column "3A", row "6", are the hexatonic analogs to these four familiar scales,&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.369. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt; one of which being the [[Augmented scale]],&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.368. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt; and another the analog of the [[Octatonic scale]] - which itself appears, alone and solitary, at Column "&gt;=4A". row "8".&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.360. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;  Column "2A", row "4", another minimum, represents a few frankly dissonant, yet strangely ''resonant'' harmonic combinations: mM9 with no 5, 11{{music|flat}}9, dom13{{music|flat}}9, and M7{{music|sharp}}11.&lt;ref name="Wilmott, Brett 1994 p.210"/&gt;

As music tends towards increasing dissonance through history, perhaps someday Column 2 will be as acceptable as even Column 1 might be, and Column 3 will finally have a place in the harmony of the world.

Note, too, that in the highest cardinality row for each column before the terminal zeros begin, the sonority counts are small, except for row "7" and the "3" columns of all sorts.  This explosion of hemitonic possibility associated with note cardinality 7 (and above) possibly marks the lower bound for the entity called "scale" (in contrast to "chord").

As shown in the table, anhemitonia is a property of the domain of note sets cardinality 2 through 6, while ancohemitonia is a property of the domain of note sets cardinality 4 through 8 (3 through 8 for improper ancohemitonia including unhemitonia as well).  This places anhemitonia generally in the range of "chords" and ancohemitonia generally in the range of "scales".

== Example: hemitonia and tritonia of the perfect-fifth projection ==
The interrelationship of semitones, tritones, and increasing note count can be demonstrated by taking five consecutive pitches from the [[circle of fifths]];&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, Paul. 1973. ''Perspectives in Music Theory: An Historical-Analytical Approach'', p. 18. New York: Dodd, Mead. {{ISBN|0-396-06752-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; starting on C, these are C, G, D, A, and E. Transposing the pitches to fit into one [[octave]] rearranges the pitches into the [[Major pentatonic scale#Major pentatonic scale|major pentatonic scale]]: C, D, E, G, A.  This scale is anhemitonic, having no semitones; it is atritonic, having no tritones.

|width="60%"|[[Image:C major pentatonic scale.PNG|none|400px|C major pentatonic scale]]

|}

In addition, this is the maximal number of notes taken consecutively from the circle of fifths for which is it still possible to avoid a semitone.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.29. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding another note from the circle of fifths gives the major hexatonic scale: C D E G A B.  This scale is hemitonic, having a semitone between B and C; it is atritonic, having no tritones.  In addition, this is the maximal number of notes taken consecutively from the circle of fifths for which is it still possible to avoid a tritone.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p.40. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adding still another note from the circle of fifths gives the major heptatonic scale: C D E F G A B (when the fifth is added from below the tonic).  This scale is strictly ancohemitonic, having 2 semitones but not consecutively; it is tritonic, having a tritone between F and B.  Past this point in the projection series, no new intervals are added to the [[Interval vector]] analysis of the scale,&lt;ref name="HansonHoward1"&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p. 33. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt; but cohemitonia results.

[[File:Ionian mode C.png|thumb|right|300px|P7 projection/major heptatonic on C {{audio|Ionian mode C.mid|Play}}.]]

Adding still another note from the circle of fifths gives the major octatonic scale: C D E F F{{music|sharp}} G A B (when the fifth is added from above the top note in the series--B in this case).  This scale is cohemitonic, having 3 semitones together at E F F{{music|sharp}} G, and tritonic as well.&lt;ref name="HansonHoward1" /&gt;

Similar behavior is seen across all scales generally, that more notes in a scale tend cumulatively to add [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant intervals]] (specifically: hemitonia and tritonia in no particular order) and cohemitonia not already present.  While also true that more notes in a scale tend to allow more and varied intervals in the [[interval vector]], there might be said to be a ''point of diminishing returns'', when qualified against the also increasing dissonance, hemitonia, tritonia and cohemitonia.  It is near these points where most popular scales lie.&lt;ref name="HansonHoward1" /&gt;

== Cohemitonic and hemitonic scales ==

Though less used than ancohemitonic scales, the cohemitonic scales have an interesting property.  The sequence of two (or more) consecutive halfsteps in a scale presents the opportunity to "split" the scale by placing the [[Tonic (music)|tonic note]] of the scale on the middle note of the halfstep span.  This allows a [[leading tone]] from below [[Resolution (music)|resolving]] upwards, as well as a descending [[Neapolitan chord|flat-supertonic]] upper [[Neighbor note#Neighbor tone|neighbor]], both converging on the tonic.  The split turns a weakness - dissonance of cohemitonia - to a strength: [[Counterpoint|contrapuntal]] convergence on the tonic.  It is very common that a cohemitonic (or even hemitonic) scale (e.g.: [[Hungarian minor]] { C D E{{music|flat}} F{{music|#}} G A{{music|flat}} B }) be [[Modulation (music)#Parallel key modulation|displaced preferentially]] to a mode where the halfstep span is split (e.cont.: [[Double harmonic scale]] { G A{{music|flat}} B C D E{{music|flat}} F{{music|#}} }), and by which name we more commonly know the same [[Necklace (combinatorics)|circular series]] of intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Schillinger, Joseph. (1941) ''The Schillinger System of Musical Composition'', v.1, p. 113ff. New York: Carl Fischer. {{ISBN|0306775212}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cohemitonic scales with multiple halfstep spans present the additional possibility of [[Modulation (music)|modulating]] between tonics each furnished with both upper and lower neighbors.

== Modes of heptatonic scales and the key signature system ==

[[File:A-major f-sharp-minor.svg|thumb|right|150px|Key signature [[A major]] / [[F-sharp minor|F{{music|#}} minor]], an ancohemitonic heptatonic scale.]]

Western music's system of [[key signature]] is based upon the assumption of a [[heptatonic scale]] of 7 notes, such that there are never more than 7 accidentals present in a valid key signature.  The global preference for anhemitonic scales combines with this basis to highlight the 6 ancohemitonic heptatonic scales,&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', p. 362ff. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt; most of which are common in [[romantic music]], and of which most Romantic music is composed:
* [[Diatonic scale]]
* Melodic major/[[Melodic minor#Melodic minor scale|melodic minor]]
* [[Hungarian major scale]]
* involution of Hungarian major
* [[Harmonic major scale]]
* [[Harmonic minor#Harmonic minor scale|Harmonic minor scale]].

These cohemitonic scales are less common:
* [[Double harmonic major scale]]
* [[Neapolitan major scale]]
* [[Neapolitan minor scale]]
* Ionian {{music|b}}5 scale
* Persian scale
* Locrian {{music|#}}7 scale.
Adhering to the definition of heptatonic scales, these all possess 7 [[Mode (music)|modes]] each, and are suitable for use in [[Modulation (music)#Parallel key modulation|modal mutation]].&lt;ref&gt;Christ, William (1966). ''Materials and Structure of Music'', v.1, p. 45. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice-Hall. LOC 66-14354.&lt;/ref&gt;  They appear in the table above in Row "7", Columns "2A" and "3A".

{{Psychology sidebar|applied}}
'''Applied psychology''' is the use of [[psychological]] methods and findings of scientific psychology to solve practical problems of human and animal behavior and experience. [[Mental health]], [[organizational psychology]], [[business management]], [[education]], [[health]], [[product design]], [[ergonomics]], and [[law]] are just a few of the areas that have been influenced by the application of psychological principles and findings. Some of the areas of applied psychology include [[clinical psychology]], [[counseling psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[industrial and organizational psychology]], [[legal psychology]], [[neuropsychology]], [[occupational health psychology]], [[human factors]], [[forensic psychology]], [[engineering psychology]], [[school psychology]], [[sports psychology]], [[traffic psychology]], [[community psychology]], [[medical psychology]]. In addition, a number of specialized areas in the general field of psychology have applied branches (e.g., applied [[social psychology]], applied [[cognitive psychology]]). However, the lines between sub-branch specializations and major applied psychology categories are often blurred. For example, a [[human factor]]s psychologist might use a cognitive psychology theory. This could be described as human factor psychology or as applied cognitive psychology.

== History ==

The founder of applied psychology was [[Hugo Münsterberg]]. He came to America (Harvard) from Germany (Berlin, Laboratory of Stern), invited by William James, and, like many aspiring psychologists during the late 19th century, originally studied philosophy. Münsterberg had many interests in the field of psychology such as purposive psychology, social psychology and forensic psychology. In 1907 he wrote several magazine articles concerning legal aspects of testimony, confessions and courtroom procedures, which eventually developed into his book, ''On the Witness Stand''. The following year the Division of Applied Psychology was adjoined to the Harvard Psychological Laboratory. Within 9 years he had contributed eight books in English, applying psychology to education, industrial efficiency, business and teaching. Eventually Hugo Münsterberg and his contributions would define him as the creator of applied psychology. In 1920, the [[International Association of Applied Psychology]] (IAAP) was founded, as the first international scholarly society within the field of psychology.

Most professional psychologists in the U.S. worked in an academic setting until World War II. But during the war, the armed forces and the [[Office of Strategic Services]] hired psychologists in droves to work on issues such as troop morale and propaganda design.&lt;ref&gt;Cina, "Social Science For Whom?" (1981), pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, psychologists found an expanding range of jobs outside of the academy.&lt;ref&gt;Anastasi, ''Fields of Applied Psychology'' (1979), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1970, the number of college graduates with degrees in psychology has more than doubled, from 33,679 to 76,671 in 2002. The annual numbers of masters' and PhD degrees have also increased dramatically over the same period. All the while, degrees in the related fields of economics, sociology, and political science have remained constant.&lt;ref name=DonaldsonBerger&gt;Stewart I. Donaldson &amp; Dale E. Berger, "The Rise and Promise of Applied Psychology in the 21st Century", in Donaldson, Berger, &amp; Pezdek (eds.), ''Applied Psychology'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional organizations have organized special events and meetings to promote the idea of applied psychology. In 1990, the [[American Psychological Society]] held a Behavioral Science Summit and formed the "Human Capital Initiative", spanning schools, workplace productivity, drugs, violence, and community health. The [[American Psychological Association]] declared 2000–2010 the [[Decade of Behavior]], with a similarly broad scope.&lt;ref name=DonaldsonBerger /&gt; Psychological methods are considered applicable to all aspects of human life and society.&lt;ref name=Zimbardo&gt;[[Philip G. Zimbardo]], "Does Psychology Make a Significant Difference in Our Lives?", in Donaldson, Berger, &amp; Pezdek (eds.), ''Applied Psychology'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advertising ==
Business advertisers have long consulted psychologists in assessing what types of messages will most effectively induce a person to buy a particular product. Using the psychological research methods and the findings in human's cognition, motivation, attitudes and decision making, those can help to design more persuasive advertisement. Their research includes the study of unconscious influences and brand loyalty.&lt;ref name=PezdekEtAl&gt;Kathy Pezdek, Kenneth A. Deffenbacher, Shirley Lam, &amp; Robert R. Hoffman, "Cognitive Psychology: Applications and Careers", in Donaldson, Berger, &amp; Pezdek (eds.), ''Applied Psychology'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the effect of unconscious influences was controversial&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Psychology and Life|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical psychology==
[[Clinical psychology]] includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically-based distress or [[mental illness|dysfunction]] and to promote subjective [[mental health|well-being]] and personal development.&lt;ref name="apa1"&gt;American Psychological Association, Division 12, "[http://www.apa.org/divisions/div12/aboutcp.html About Clinical Psychology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019125113/http://www.apa.org/divisions/div12/aboutcp.html |date=2015-10-19 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; Central to its practice are [[psychological testing|psychological assessment]] and [[psychotherapy]], although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;Brain, Christine. (2002). ''Advanced psychology: applications, issues and perspectives.'' Cheltenham: Nelson Thornes. {{ISBN|0-17-490058-9}}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some clinical psychologists may focus on the clinical management of patients with [[acquired brain injury|brain injury]]—this area is known as [[clinical neuropsychology]]. In many countries clinical psychology is a regulated [[mental health profession]].

The work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be done inside various therapy models, all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client—usually an individual, couple, family, or small group—that employs a set of procedures intended to form a therapeutic alliance, explore the nature of psychological problems, and encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. The four major perspectives are [[psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic]], [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioral]], [[humanistic psychology|existential-humanistic]], and [[family therapy|systems or family therapy]]. There has been a growing movement to integrate these various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding ethnicity, gender, spirituality, and sexual-orientation. With the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy, there is growing evidence that most of the major therapies are about of equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a strong therapeutic alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Leichsenring | first1 = Falk | last2 = Leibing | first2 = Eric | year = 2003 | title = The effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy and cognitive behavior therapy in the treatment of personality disorders: A meta-analysis | url = | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 160 | issue = 7| pages = 1223–1233 | doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.7.1223 | pmid=12832233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reisner | first1 = Andrew | year = 2005 | title = The common factors, empirically validated treatments, and recovery models of therapeutic change | url = | journal = The Psychological Record | volume = 55 | issue = 3| pages = 377–400 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an [[integrative psychotherapy|eclectic therapeutic orientation]].

Clinical psychologists do not usually [[medical prescription|prescribe]] medication, although there is a growing number of psychologists who do have prescribing privileges, in the field of [[medical psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Klusman | first1 = Lawrence | year = 2001 | title = Prescribing Psychologists and Patients' Medical Needs; Lessons From Clinical Psychiatry | url = | journal = Professional Psychology: Research and Practice | volume = 32 | issue = 5| pages = 496–500 | doi=10.1037/0735-7028.32.5.496}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, however, when medication is warranted many psychologists will work in cooperation with psychiatrists so that clients get all their therapeutic needs met.&lt;ref name="brain"/&gt; Clinical psychologists may also work as part of a team with other professionals, such as [[social work]]ers and [[nutrition]]ists.

==Counseling psychology==
[[Counseling psychology]] is an applied specialization within psychology, that involves both research and practice in a number of different areas or domains. According to Gelso and Fretz (2001), there are some central unifying themes among counseling psychologists. These include a focus on an individual’s strengths, relationships, their educational and career development, as well as a focus on normal personalities.&lt;ref&gt;Gelso, C.J., &amp; Fretz, B. (2001). ''Counseling Psychology'', (2nd ed.): Brooks Cole.&lt;/ref&gt; Counseling psychologists help people improve their well-being, reduce and manage stress, and improve overall functioning in their lives. The interventions used by Counseling Psychologists may be either brief or long-term in duration. Often they are problem focused and goal-directed. There is a guiding philosophy which places a value on [[individual differences]] and an emphasis on "prevention, development, and adjustment across the life-span."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.div17.org/about/what-is-counseling-psychology/|title=What is Counseling Psychology - Society of Counseling Psychology, Division 17|author=|date=|website=www.div17.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419013614/http://www.div17.org/about/what-is-counseling-psychology/|archivedate=2014-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational psychology==
[[Educational psychology]] is devoted to the study of how humans learn in [[education]]al settings, especially schools. Psychologists assess the effects of specific educational interventions: e.g., [[phonics]] versus [[whole language]] instruction in early reading attainment. They also study the question of why learning occurs differently in different situations.&lt;ref name=PezdekEtAl /&gt;

Another domain of educational psychology is the psychology of teaching. In some colleges, educational psychology courses are called "the psychology of learning and teaching". Educational psychology derives a great deal from [[basic science (psychology)|basic-science disciplines]] within psychology including [[cognitive science]] and [[behaviorism|behaviorially-oriented]] research on learning.

==Environmental psychology==
[[Environmental psychology]] is the psychological study of humans and their interactions with their environments. The types of environments studied are limitless, ranging from homes, offices, classrooms, factories, nature, and so on. However, across these different environments, there are several common themes of study that emerge within each one. Noise level and ambient temperature are clearly present in all environments and often subjects of discussion for environmental psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = C. A. | year = 1989 | title = Temperature and aggression: Ubiquitous effects of heat on occurrence of human violence | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 106 | issue = | pages = 74–96 | doi = 10.1037/0033-2909.106.1.74 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crowding and stressors are a few other aspects of environments studied by this sub-discipline of psychology.&lt;ref name="Ravizza, K. 2006 pp. 228"/&gt; When examining a particular environment, environmental psychology looks at the goals and purposes of the people in the using the environment, and tries to determine how well the environment is suiting the needs of the people using it. For example, a quiet environment is necessary for a classroom of students taking a test, but would not be needed or expected on a farm full of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weinstein | first1 = C. S. | year = 1979 | title = The physical environment of the school: A review of the research | url = | journal = Review of Educational Research | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 577–610 | doi=10.3102/00346543049004577}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts and trends learned through environmental psychology can be used when setting up or rearranging spaces so that the space will best perform its intended function. The top common, more well known areas of psychology that drive this applied field include: cognitive, perception, learning, and social psychology.

==Forensic psychology and legal psychology==
[[Forensic psychology]] and [[legal psychology]] are the area concerned with the application of psychological methods and principles to legal questions and issues. Most typically, forensic psychology involves a clinical analysis of a particular individual and an assessment of some specific psycho-legal question. The psycho-legal question does not have to be criminal in nature. In fact, the forensic psychologist rarely gets involved in the actual criminal investigations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Huss | first1 = M. T. | year = 2001 | title = What is forensic psychology? It's not Silence of the Lambs! | url = | journal = Eye on Psi Chi | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 25–27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Custody cases are a great example of non-criminal evaluations by forensic psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ackerman | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Ackerman | first2 = M. C. | doi = 10.1037/0735-7028.28.2.137 | title = Custody evaluation practices: A survey of experienced professionals (revisited) | journal = Professional Psychology: Research and Practice | volume = 28 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–145 | year = 1997 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The validity and upholding of eyewitness testimony is an area of forensic psychology that does veer closer to criminal investigations, though does not directly involve the psychologist in the investigation process. Psychologists are often called to testify as [[expert witness]]es on issues such as the accuracy of memory, the reliability of police interrogation, and the appropriate course of action in [[child custody]] cases.&lt;ref name=DavisLoftus /&gt;

Legal psychology refers to any application of psychological principles, methods or understanding to legal questions or issues. In addition to the applied practices, legal psychology also includes academic or empirical research on topics involving the relationship of law to human mental processes and behavior. However, inherent differences that arise when placing psychology in the legal context.&lt;ref&gt;Ogloff, J. R., and Finkelman, D. (1999). Psychology and law: An overview. In R. Roesch, ed., S. D. Hart, ed., &amp; J. R. P. Ogloff (Eds.), Psychology and law: The state of the discipline (pp. 1–20). New York: Kluwer Academic/Plenum.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychology rarely makes absolute statements. Instead, psychologists traffic in the terms like level of confidence, percentages, and significance. Legal matters, on the other hand, look for absolutes: guilty or not guilty. This makes for a sticky union between psychology and the legal system. Some universities operate dual JD/PhD programs focusing on the intersection of these two areas.&lt;ref name=DavisLoftus /&gt;

The Committee on Legal Issues of the American Psychological Association is known to file ''[[amicus curae]]'' briefs, as applications of psychological knowledge to high-profile court cases.&lt;ref name=DavisLoftus&gt;Deborah Davis &amp; Elizabeth F. Loftus, "Psychologists in the Forensic World", in Donaldson, Berger, &amp; Pezdek (eds.), ''Applied Psychology'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

A related field, [[police psychology]], involves consultation with police departments and participation in police training.&lt;ref name=DavisLoftus /&gt;

== Health and medicine ==
[[Health psychology]] concerns itself with understanding how biology, behavior, and social context influence health and illness.&lt;ref&gt;APA, Division 38. ''[http://www.health-psych.org/articles/what_is.php What a Health Psychologist Does and How to Become One] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716132441/http://www.health-psych.org/articles/what_is.php |date=July 16, 2007 }}.'' Retrieved 03-04-2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Health psychologists generally work alongside other medical professionals in clinical settings, although many also teach and conduct research. Although its early beginnings can be traced to the kindred field of [[clinical psychology]], four different approaches to health psychology have been defined: clinical, public health, community and critical health psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Marks, D.F., Murray, M. et al. (2005). "Health Psychology: Theory, Research &amp; Practice." London, England: Sage Publications. {{ISBN|1-4129-0336-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health psychologists aim to change health behaviors for the dual purpose of helping people stay healthy and helping patients adhere to disease treatment regimens.  The focus of health psychologists tend to center on the health crisis facing the western world particularly in the US. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] and [[behavior modification]] are techniques often employed by health psychologists. Psychologists also study patients' [[Compliance (medicine)|compliance]] with their doctors' orders.&lt;ref name=Friedman /&gt;

Health psychologists view a person's mental condition as heavily related to their physical condition.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, H. S., ed., &amp; Silver, R. C. (Eds.). (2007). Foundations of health psychology. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; An important concept in this field is [[Stress (psychological)|stress]], a mental phenomenon with well-known consequences for physical health.&lt;ref name=Friedman&gt;Howard S. Friedman, "Applying Psychology to Promote Health", in Donaldson, Berger, &amp; Pezdek (eds.), ''Applied Psychology'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical ===

[[Medical psychology]] involves the application of a range of psychological principles, theories and findings applied to the effective management of physical and mental disorders to improve the psychological and physical health of the patient.  The [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) defines medical psychology as the branch of psychology that integrates somatic and psychotherapeutic modalities, into the management of mental illness, health rehabilitation and emotional, cognitive, behavioural and substance use disorders. According to Muse and Moore (2012), the medical psychologist's contributions in the areas of [[psychopharmacology]] which sets it apart from other  of psychotherapy and psychotherpists.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, B. &amp; Muse, M. (2012). Handbook of Clinical Psychopharmacology for Psychologists. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Occupational health psychology ===

[[Occupational health psychology]] (OHP) is a relatively new discipline that emerged from the confluence of health psychology, industrial and organizational psychology, and [[occupational safety and health|occupational health]].&lt;ref&gt;Everly, G.S., Jr. (1986). An introduction to occupational health psychology. In P.A. Keller &amp; L.G. Ritt (Eds.), ''Innovations in clinical practice: A source book, Vol. 5'' (pp. 331–338). Sarasota, FL: Professional Resource Exchange.&lt;/ref&gt; OHP has its own journals and professional organizations. The field is concerned with identifying psychosocial characteristics of workplaces that give rise to health-related problems in people who work. These problems can involve physical health (e.g., cardiovascular disease&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bosma | first1 = H. | last2 = Marmot | first2 = M.G. | last3 = Hemingway | first3 = H. | last4 = Nicholson | first4 = A.C. | last5 = Brunner | first5 = E. | last6 = Stansfeld | first6 = S.A. | year = 1997 | title = Low job control and risk of coronary heart disease in Whitehall II (prospective cohort) study | url = | journal = British Medical Journal | volume = 314 | issue = | pages = 558–565 | doi=10.1136/bmj.314.7080.558}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or mental health (e.g., depression&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tucker | first1 = J.S. | last2 = Sinclair | first2 = R.R. | last3 = Thomas | first3 = J.L. | year = 2005 | title = The multilevel effects of occupational stressors on soldiers' well-being: Organizational attachment, and readiness | url = | journal = Journal of Occupational Health Psychology | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 276–299 | doi=10.1037/1076-8998.10.3.276}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Examples of psychosocial characteristics of workplaces that OHP has investigated include amount of decision latitude&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karasek | first1 = R.A. | year = 1979 | title = Job demands, job decision latitude, and mental strain: Implications for job redesign | url = | journal = Administrative Science Quarterly | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 285–307 | doi=10.2307/2392498}}&lt;/ref&gt; a worker can exercise and the supportiveness of supervisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Moyle | first1 = P | year = 1998 | title = Longitudinal influences of managerial support on employee well-being | url = | journal = Work &amp; Stress | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 29–49 | doi=10.1080/02678379808256847}}&lt;/ref&gt; OHP is also concerned with the development and implementation of interventions that can prevent or ameliorate work-related health problems.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, L.

==Human factors and ergonomics==
[[Human factors and ergonomics]] (HF&amp;E) is the study of how cognitive and psychological processes affect our interaction with tools, machines, and objects in the environment. Many branches of psychology attempt to create models of and understand human behavior. These models are usually based on data collected from experiments. Human Factor psychologists however, take the same data and use it to design or adapt processes and objects that will compliment the human component of the equation.&lt;ref&gt;Meister, D. (1999). The history of human factors and ergonomics. Mahwah, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than humans learning how to use and manipulate a piece of technology, human factors strives to design technology to be inline with the human behavior models designed by general psychology. This could be accounting for physical limitations of humans, as in ergonomics, or designing systems, especially computer systems, that work intuitively with humans, as does engineering psychology.

Ergonomics is applied primarily through office work and the transportation industry. Psychologists here take into account the physical limitations of the human body and attempt to reduce fatigue and stress by designing products and systems that work within the natural limitations of the human body. From simple things like the size of buttons and design of office chairs to layout of airplane cockpits, human factor psychologists, specializing in ergonomics, attempt to de-stress our everyday lives and sometimes even save them.

Human factor psychologists specializing in [[engineering psychology]] tend to take on slightly different projects than their ergonomic centered counterparts. These psychologists look at how a human and a process interact.&lt;ref&gt;Roscoe, S. N. (1997). The adolescence of engineering psychology. In S. M. Casey (Series Ed.), Human factors history monograph series (Vol. 1). Santa Monica, CA: Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.&lt;/ref&gt; Often engineering psychology may be centered on computers. However at the base level, a process is simply a series of inputs and outputs between a human and a machine. The human must have a clear method to input data and be able to easily access the information in output. The inability of rapid and accurate corrections can sometimes lead to drastic consequences, as summed up by many stories in Set Phasers on Stun.&lt;ref&gt;Casey, S.M. (1998). Set Phasers on Stun: And Other True Tales of Design, Technology, and Human Error&lt;/ref&gt; The engineering psychologists wants to make the process of inputs and outputs as intuitive as possible for the user.

The goal of research in human factors is to understand the limitations and biases of human mental processes and behavior, and design items and systems that will interact accordingly with the limitations. Some may see human factors as intuitive or a list of dos and don'ts, but in reality, human factor research strives to find the make sense of large piles of data to bring precise applications to product designs and systems to help people work more naturally, intuitively with the items of their surroundings.

==Industrial and organizational psychology==
[[Industrial and organizational psychology]], or I-O psychology, focuses on the psychology of the workforce, customer, and consumer, including issues such as the psychology of recruitment, selecting employees from an applicant pool, training, [[performance appraisal]], [[job satisfaction]], [[work motivation]]. [[work behavior]], [[stress (medicine)|stress]] at work and [[management]]. In short, I-O psychology is the application of psychology to the workplace. A core aspect of this field is [[job analysis]], the detailed study of which behaviors a given job entails.&lt;ref&gt;Anastasi, ''Fields of Applied Psychology'' (1979), pp. 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the name of the title "Industrial Organizational Psychology" implies 2 split disciplines being chained together, it is near impossible to have one half without the other. If asked to generally define the differences, Industrial psychology focuses more on the [[Human Resources]] aspects of the field, and Organizational psychology focuses more on the personal interactions of the employees. When applying these principles however, they are not easily broken apart. For example, when developing requirements for a new job position, the recruiters are looking for an applicant with strong communication skills in multiple areas. The developing of the position requirements falls under the industrial psychology, human resource type work. and the requirement of communication skills is related to how the employee with interacts with co-workers. As seen here, it is hard to separate task of developing a qualifications list from the types of qualifications on the list. This is parallel to how the I and O are nearly inseparable in practice. Therefore, I-O psychologists are generally rounded in both industrial and organizational psychology though they will have some specialization. Other topics of interest for I-O psychologists include performance evaluation, training, and much more.

[[Military psychology]] includes research into the classification, training, and performance of soldiers.&lt;ref name=PezdekEtAl /&gt;

==School psychology==
[[School psychology]] is a field that applies principles of [[clinical psychology]] and [[educational psychology]] to the diagnosis and treatment of students' behavioral and learning problems. School psychologists are educated in [[child development|child and adolescent development]], [[learning]] theories, psychological and psycho-educational [[Psychological assessment|assessment]], [[personality psychology|personality theories]], therapeutic interventions, special education, psychology, consultation, child and adolescent psychopathology, and the ethical, legal and administrative codes of their profession.

According to Division 16 (Division of School Psychology) of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA), school psychologists operate according to a scientific framework. They work to promote effectiveness and efficiency in the field. School psychologists conduct psychological assessments, provide brief interventions, and develop or help develop prevention programs. Additionally, they evaluate services with special focus on developmental processes of children within the school system, and other systems, such as families. School psychologists consult with [[teacher]]s, parents, and school personnel about learning, behavioral, social, and emotional problems. They may teach lessons on parenting skills (like school counselors), learning strategies, and other skills related to school [[mental health]]. In addition, they explain test results to parents and students. They provide individual, group, and in some cases family counseling (State Board of Education 2003; National Clearinghouse for Professions in Special Education, n.d.). School psychologists are actively involved in district and school crisis intervention teams. They also supervise graduate students in school psychology. School psychologists in many districts provide professional development to teachers and other school personnel on topics such as positive behavior intervention plans and achievement tests.

One salient application for school psychology in today's world is responding to the unique challenges of increasingly multicultural classrooms. For example, psychologists can contribute insight about the differences between individualistic and collectivistic cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Greenfield, "Applying Developmental Psychology to Bridge Cultures in the Classroom", in Donaldson, Berger, &amp; Pezdek (eds.), ''Applied Psychology'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

School psychologists are influential within the school system and are frequently consulted to solve problems. Practitioners should be able to provide consultation and collaborate with other members of the educational community and confidently make decisions based on empirical research.

== Social change ==
Psychologists have been employed to promote "green" behavior, i.e. [[sustainable development]]. In this case, their goal is [[behavior modification]], through strategies such as [[social marketing]]. Tactics include education, disseminating information, organizing social movements, passing laws, and altering taxes to influence decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Oskamp &amp; P. Wesley Schultz, "Using Psychological Science to Achieve Ecological Sustainability", in Donaldson, Berger, &amp; Pezdek (eds.), ''Applied Psychology'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychology has been applied on a world scale with the aim of [[population control]]. For example, one strategy towards television programming combines social models in a soap opera with informational messages during advertising time. This strategy successfully increased women's enrollment at family planning clinics in Mexico.&lt;ref name=Zimbardo /&gt; The programming—which has been deployed around the world by Population Communications International and the Population Media Center—combines family planning messages with representations of female education and literacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Bandura]], "Going Global With Social Cognitive Theory: From Prospect to Paydirt", in Donaldson, Berger, &amp; Pezdek (eds.), ''Applied Psychology'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sport psychology==
[[Sport psychology]] is a specialization within [[psychology]] that seeks to understand psychological/mental factors that affect [[performance]] in [[sport]]s, [[physical activity]] and [[exercise]] and apply these to enhance individual and [[team]] performance. The sport psychology approach differs from the coaches and players perspective.&lt;ref name="Ravizza, K. 2006 pp. 228"&gt;Ravizza, K. (2006). Increasing awareness for sport performance. In J. M. Williams (Ed.), Applied sport psychology (pp. 228–239). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Coaches tend to narrow their focus and energy towards the end-goal. They are concerned with the actions that lead to the win, as opposed to the sport psychologist who tries to focus the players thoughts on just achieving the win. Sport psychology trains players mentally to prepare them, whereas coaches tend to focus mostly on physical training. Sport psychology deals with increasing performance by managing emotions and minimizing the psychological effects of injury and poor performance. Some of the most important skills taught are goal setting, relaxation, visualization, self-talk awareness and control, concentration, using rituals, attribution training, and periodization. The principles and theories may be applied to any human movement or performance tasks (e.g., playing a musical instrument, acting in a play, public speaking, motor skills). Usually, experts recommend that students be trained in both [[kinesiology]] (i.e., sport and exercise sciences, [[physical education]]) and [[psychotherapy|counseling]].

==Traffic psychology==
[[Traffic psychology]] is an applied discipline within psychology that looks at the relationship between psychological processes and cognitions and the actual behavior of road users. In general, traffic psychologists attempt to apply these principles and research findings, in order to provide solutions to problems such as traffic mobility and congestion, road accidents, speeding. Research psychologists also are involved with the education and the motivation of road users.&lt;ref name=Rothengatter&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rothengatter|first=T.|title=Psychological aspects of road user behavior.|journal=Applied Psychology: An International Review|year=1997|volume=46|issue=3|pages=223–234|doi=10.1111/j.1464-0597.1997.tb01227.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gold&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldenbeld|first=C.|author2=Levelt, P.B.M.|author3=Heidstra, J.|title=Psychological perspectives on changing driver attitude and behaviour.|journal=recherche-Transports-Securite|year=2000|volume=67|pages=65–81|doi=10.1016/s0761-8980(00)90108-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Basic precipitation''' or '''Alkaline precipitation''' occurs when either [[calcium oxide]] or [[sodium hydroxide]] is emitted into the [[atmosphere]], absorbed by water droplets in [[cloud]]s, and then falls as [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rain, snow, or sleet]]. Precipitation containing these compounds can increase the [[pH]] of [[soil]] or bodies of water and lead to increased [[fungus|fungal growth]].

The principal cause of basic rain is emissions from factories and waste deposits. Mineral dust containing large amounts of alkaline compounds such as [[calcium carbonate]] can also increase the pH of precipitation and contribute to basic rain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Özsoy|first=Türkan|last2=Cemal Saydam|first2=A|date=2000-05-15|title=Acidic and alkaline precipitation in the Cilician Basin, north-eastern Mediterranean Sea|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969700003806|journal=Science of the Total Environment|volume=253|issue=1–3|pages=93–109|doi=10.1016/S0048-9697(00)00380-6|bibcode=2000ScTEn.253...93O}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basic rain can be viewed as opposite to [[acid rain]].
Acid rain has posed a serious threat to numerous ecosystems surrounding rivers, lakes and forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acid Rain|url=http://www3.epa.gov/acidrain/|website=U.S Environmental Protection Agency|publisher=[[EPA]]|accessdate=2015-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Braunschweigisches Landesmuseum''' (''BLM'') is a [[history museum]] in [[Braunschweig]], Germany, operated by the state of [[Lower Saxony]]. The museum is scattered on four locations: ''Vieweghaus'', ''Hinter Ägidien'' (both in Braunschweig), ''Kanzlei'' ([[Wolfenbüttel]]) and ''Bauernhausmuseum'' ([[Bortfeld]]).

The collection covers 500,000 years and includes objects from the history of the [[Brunswick Land|Braunschweig area]], including culture, economy, technology, folk arts, and social history. Today, the BLM hosts a collection of 600,000 to 800,000 objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{De icon}} [http://www.3landesmuseen.de/Geschichte.467.0.html BLM] Sammlung &gt; Sammlungsbestände &gt; Die Sammlungsbestände des Braunschweigischen Landesmuseums. Retrieved 2013-01-07.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The museum's history dates back to October 11, 1891, when it was founded in the [[Duchy of Brunswick]] as ''Vaterländisches Museum für Braunschweigische Landesgeschichte''.&lt;ref&gt;{{De icon}} [http://www.3landesmuseen.de/Geschichte.467.0.html BLM] Über uns &gt; Geschichte &gt; Landesgeschichte seit mehr als 120 Jahren. Retrieved 2013-01-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally it was located in a street called ''Hagenscharrn'' in the city of Braunschweig. In 1938, the museum was renamed to Braunschweigisches Landesmuseum für Geschichte und Volkstum. This name remained until December 31, 1982.

==Vieweghaus==
The [[Neoclassicism|neoclassicist]] building, the former publishing house of [[Vieweg+Teubner Verlag|Vieweg Verlag]], hosts the main collection, and is located in the [[Innenstadt (Braunschweig)|city center]] at the [[Dankwarderode Castle|castle square]] (''Burgplatz''). A large part of the collection was moved there in 1986. &lt;!-- Highlights are... --&gt;

==Hinter Ägidien==
Located in the street ''[[Aegidienkirche, Braunschweig|Hinter St. Aegidien]]'', this annex exhibits [[Jewish ceremonial art|Judaica]] and was opened to the public in 1746. Center piece is a [[synagogue]] interior from [[Hamburg]].

==Kanzlei Wolfenbüttel==
This annex focuses on prehistoric and ancient history (500,000 BC until 8th century AD) of the region and was established there in 1959. The building was built in the 16th century and is located in the city center.

==Bauernhausmuseum==
The Bortfelder Bauernhausmuseum section was opened in 1968 and is located in Bortfeld, a village in the municipality of [[Wendeburg]], [[Peine (district)|district of Peine]]. This museum reflects on the rural life of the region. The central attraction is a [[farmhouse]] from 1639 (reetgedecktes Hallenhaus).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3611">:''In [[Hindu mythology]], [[Consorts of Ganesha#Buddhi (Wisdom)|Buddhi]] is one of the wives of [[Ganesha]].''

'''Buddhi''' is a [[Vedic Sanskrit]] word that means the intellectual faculty and the power to "form and retain concepts, reason, discern, judge, comprehend, understand".&lt;ref name="Monier-WilliamsLeumann2002p733"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ianwhicherp18/&gt;

==Etymology==
''Buddhi'' ({{lang-sa|बुद्धि}}) is derived from the Vedic Sanskrit root ''Budh'' (बुध् ), which literally means "to wake, be awake, observe, heed, attend, learn, become aware of, to know, be conscious again".&lt;ref name="Monier-WilliamsLeumann2002p733"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sir Monier Monier-Williams|author2=Ernst Leumann|author3=Carl Cappeller|title=A Sanskrit-English Dictionary: Etymologically and Philologically Arranged with Special Reference to Cognate Indo-European Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zUezTfym7CAC|year=2002|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-3105-6|page=733}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term appears extensively in [[Rigveda]] and other Vedic literature.&lt;ref name="Monier-WilliamsLeumann2002p733"/&gt; ''Buddhi'' means, states Monier Williams, the power to "form, retain concepts; intelligence, reason, intellect, mind", the intellectual faculty and the ability to "discern, judge, comprehend, understand" something.&lt;ref name="Monier-WilliamsLeumann2002p733"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sinha2013p120"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jadunath Sinha |title=Indian Psychology Perception |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WmBGAQAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-136-34605-7 |pages=120–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buddhi is a feminine [[Sanskrit]] noun derived from ''*budh'', to be [[awake]], to [[understanding|understand]], to [[know]]. The same root is the basis for the more familiar masculine form ''[[Buddha]]'' and the [[abstract noun]] ''[[bodhi]]''.

==Usage==
In [[Samkhya]] and [[yoga|yogic philosophy]] both the mind and the ego are forms in the realm of nature (''[[prakriti]]'') that have emerged into materiality as a function of the three ''[[gunas]]'' (ग़ुण) through a misapprehension of ''[[purusha]]'' (पुरूष) (the consciousness-essence of the ''[[jiva]]tman''). Discriminative in nature (बुद्धि निश्चयात्मिका चित्त-वृत्ति), ''buddhi'' is that which is able to discern truth (''[[satya]]'') from falsehood and thereby to make wisdom possible.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

'''Classical Realism''' refers to an artistic movement in late-20th and early 21st century in which [[drawing]] and [[painting]] place a high value upon [[skill]] and [[beauty]], combining elements of 19th-century [[neoclassicism]] and [[Realism (visual arts)|realism]].

==Origins==

[[Image:Jean-Leon Gerome Pollice Verso.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Léon Gérôme]]. ''[[Pollice Verso]]'' (1872). Classical Realism traces its lineage from Gérôme.]]

The term "Classical Realism" first appeared as a description of literary style, as in an 1882 criticism of [[John Milton|Milton]]'s poetry.&lt;ref&gt;S. Birch, ''The Educational Times''. Vol. 35, No. 249, January 1, 1882, page 294.&lt;/ref&gt; Its usage relating to the visual arts dates back to at least 1905 in a reference to [[Masaccio]]'s paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Mahler, Arthur; Blacker; Carlos; Slater, William Albert. ''Paintings of the Louvre, Italian and Spanish'', Doubleday, 1905, page 26.&lt;/ref&gt; It originated as the title of a contemporary but traditional artistic movement with Richard Lack (1928–2009), who was a pupil of Boston artist [[R. H. Ives Gammell]] (1893–1981) during the early 1950s. Ives Gammell had studied with [[William McGregor Paxton]] (1869–1941) and Paxton had studied with 19th-century French artist, [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904). In 1967 Lack established Atelier Lack, a studio-school of fine art patterned after the ateliers of 19th-century Paris and the teaching of the Boston impressionists. By 1980 he had trained a significant group of young painters. In 1982, they organized a traveling exhibition of their work and that of other artists within the artistic tradition represented by Gammell, Lack and their students. Lack was asked by Vern Swanson, director of the [[Springville Museum of Art]], [[Springville, Utah]], (the exhibition's originating venue), to coin a term that would differentiate the realism of the heirs of the Boston tradition from that of other representational artists. Although he was reluctant to label this work, Lack chose the expression "Classical Realism." It was first used in the title of that exhibition: ''Classical Realism: The Other Twentieth Century''. The term, "Classical Realism", was originally intended to describe work that combined the fine drawing and design of the European academic tradition as exemplified by Gérôme with the observed color values of the American Boston tradition as exemplified by Paxton.

In 1985 Atelier Lack began publishing the ''Classical Realism Quarterly'', featuring articles written by Richard Lack and his students to educate and inform the public about traditional representational painting. In 1988 Lack and several associates founded The American Society of Classical Realism, a society organized to preserve and promote fine representational art. The ASCR functioned until 2005 and published the influential ''Classical Realism Journal'' and ''Classical Realism Newsletter.''

In a separate vein, another major contributor to the revival of traditional drawing and painting knowledge is the painter and  art instructor Ted Seth Jacobs (born 1927), who taught students at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]] and the New York Academy of Art in New York City.&lt;ref name="jacobs"&gt;Jacobs, Ted Seth.  ''Light for the Artist'',  Watson-Guptill Pubns (June 1988), {{ISBN|0-8230-2768-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Their lineage is rooted in the [[Académie Julian]], the Golden Age of Illustration in New York, and the School of Paris. In 1987 Ted Seth Jacobs created his own art school, L'Ecole Albert Defois in Les Cerqueux sous Passavant, France (49).  Many of Jacobs' students such as Anthony Ryder and Jacob Collins became influential teachers and acquired their own student following.&lt;ref name="ryder"&gt;Ryder, Anthony.  ''The Artist's Complete Guide to Figure Drawing: A Contemporary Perspective on the Classical Tradition'',  Watson-Guptill; 1st edition (June 1, 1999), {{ISBN|0-8230-0303-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and philosophy==

Classical Realism is characterized by love for the visible world and the great traditions of Western art, including [[Classicism]], [[Realism (visual arts)|Realism]] and [[Impressionism]].  The movement's aesthetic is Classical in that it exhibits a preference for order, beauty, harmony and completeness; it is Realist because its primary subject matter comes from the representation of nature based on the artist's observation.&lt;ref name="lack"&gt;Gjertson, Stephen.  ''Richard F. Lack: An American Master'',  American Society of Classical Realism: 2001, {{ISBN|0-9636180-3-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists in this genre strive to draw and paint from  the direct observation of nature, and eschew the use of photography or other mechanical aids. In this regard, Classical Realism differs from the art movements of [[Photorealism]] and  [[Hyperrealism (painting)|Hyperrealism]]. Stylistically, classical realists employ methods used by both [[Impressionist]] and [[Academic art]]ists.

Classical Realist painters have attempted to restore curricula of training that develop a sensitive, artistic eye and methods of representing nature that pre-date [[Modern Art]].  They seek to create paintings that are personal, expressive, beautiful, and skillful.  Their subject matter includes all of the traditional categories within Western Art: [[figurative art|figurative]], landscape, portraiture, indoor and outdoor genre and [[still life]] paintings.

A central idea of Classical Realism is the belief that the [[Modern Art]] movements of the 20th century opposed the tenets and production of traditional art and caused a general loss of the skills and methods needed to produce it. Modernism was antagonistic to art as it was conceived by the Greeks, resurrected in the [[Renaissance]], and carried on by the academies of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&lt;ref name="P1"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Panero|first=James|title=The New Old School|work=[[The New Criterion]]|volume=25|date=September 2006|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Classical Realist artists attempt to revive the idea of art production as it was traditionally understood: mastery of a craft in order to make objects that gratify and ennoble those who see them.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Roger:  "Why the Art World Is a Disaster", ''The New Criterion'', Volume 25, June 2007, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; This craftsmanship is then applied to drawing, painting or sculpting contemporary subjects which the artist observes in the modern world.

Like the 19th-century academic models from which it derives inspiration, the movement has drawn criticism for the premium placed upon technical performance, a tendency toward contrived and idealized depictions of the figure, and rhetorical overstatement when applied to epic narrative.&lt;ref name="P1"/&gt; Maureen Mullarkey of the ''[[New York Sun]]'' referred to the school as "a contemporary style with retro appeal—like Chrysler's PT Cruiser".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nysun.com/arts/nothing-left-to-hide/41413/|author=Maureen Mullarkey|title=Nothing Left To Hide|work=[[New York Sun]]|date=October 12, 2006|accessdate=November 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools==

The Classical Realist movement is currently sustained through art schools based on the [[Atelier Method]]. Many present-day academies and ateliers follow the [[Charles Bargue]] drawing course. Richard Lack is generally regarded as the founder of the contemporary atelier movement. His school, Atelier Lack, was founded in 1969 and became a model for similar schools.&lt;ref name="atelier"&gt;Aristedes, Juliette.  ''Classical Drawing Atelier: A Contemporary Guide to Traditional Studio Practice'', Watson-Guptill Publications: 2006.  {{ISBN|0-8230-0657-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; These modern ateliers are founded with the goal of revitalizing art education by reintroducing rigorous training in traditional drawing and painting techniques, employing teaching methodologies that were used in the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]. These schools pass on a method of instruction which melds formal [[academic art]] training with the influence of the French [[Impressionists]].

Under the atelier model, art students study in the studio of an established master to learn how to [[drawing|draw]] and [[paint]] with realistic accuracy and an emphasis on rendering form convincingly. The foundation of these programs rests on an intensive study of the human figure, renderings of plaster casts of [[classical sculpture]], and the emulation of their instructors. The goal is to make students adept at observation, theory, and craft while absorbing classical ideals of beauty.&lt;ref name="atelier"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2183">'''Clinical Linguistics''' is a sub-discipline of [[linguistics]] that involves the application of [[Theoretical linguistics|linguistic theory]] to the field of [[Speech-Language Pathology]]. Clinical linguistics, a branch of applied linguistics, is the use of linguistics to describe, analyze, and treat language disabilities. The study of linguistic aspect of communication disorders is of relevance to a broader understanding of language and [[linguistics|linguistic]] theory.

The [[International Clinical Phonetics and Linguistics Association]] is the unofficial organization of the field, and was formed in 1991. The journal of [[Clinical Linguistics and Phonetics]] is the major research journal of the field and was founded by [[Martin J. Ball]]. 

Practitioners of clinical linguistics typically work in Speech-Language Pathology departments or linguistics departments. They conduct research with the aims of (i) improving the assessment, treatment, and analysis of disordered speech/language, and (ii) offering insights to formal linguistic theories. While the majority of clinical linguistics journals still focus only on English linguistics, there is an emerging movement toward comparative clinical linguistics across multiple languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crystal|first=David|date=2013-04-01|title=Clinical linguistics: Conversational reflections|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699206.2012.726312|journal=Clinical Linguistics &amp; Phonetics|volume=27|issue=4|pages=236–243|doi=10.3109/02699206.2012.726312|issn=0269-9206|pmid=23339337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13240">'''Cocha Cashu Biological Station''' (Estación Biológica Cocha Cashu or EBCC) is a [[tropics|tropical]] biological [[research station]] located at 11° 54'S and 71° 22'W in [[Manú National Park]], [[Peru]]. It was established in 1969-70, predating the founding of its containing national park (est. 1973). Though only 10&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in area, the site has provided valuable research.&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt; The station is situated on the shore of an [[oxbow lake]], from which it takes its name. "Qucha" (in hispanicized spelling ''cocha'') is the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] word for lake. "Cashu" is derived from the English word "[[cashew]]" and refers to the shape of the lake.&lt;ref name="EBCC" /&gt;

==Environmental Makeup==
The area is geographically diverse, consisting of grasslands bordering the Andes, gorges, and plains where climate is more variant and drier.  The oxbow lake itself contributes areas of marsh and brushland. This is a nutrient-rich site, the soil consisting of silt and sand, and turnover along the riverbank occurs generally within 1000 years. The annual rainfall average is somewhat over 2000&amp;nbsp;mm, most of this falling from November to May. A marked dry season is from June to August. These factors combined lend to a relatively rapidly changing landscape.&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxbow birds" /&gt;

Those areas which lie outside the path of the Rio Manu's meandering edges have vegetation much older than those closer to the river, but due to common treefall, the forest canopy is low. Much of the forest is only 25–30 meters tall, with a number of trees extending outside this range at 50 meters tall or more.&lt;ref name="composition" /&gt; An extensive network of [[liana]]s extends across the understory. Patches of bamboo, totaling almost a third of the locality, are marked by a scarcity of trees.&lt;ref name="Overview" /&gt;

==Research==
Along with [[La Selva Biological Station]] in [[Costa Rica]] and [[Barro Colorado Island]] (BCI) managed by the [[Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute]] (STRI) in [[Panama]], Cocha Cashu is one of the best-studied ecological sites in the [[tropics]].  However, unlike La Selva or BCI, Cocha Cashu is in an area minimally impacted by humans, surrounded by millions of hectares of [[virgin forest]], and thus provides critical insights into the organisms and processes found in a healthy, natural [[tropical rainforest]].  Over 500 articles, books, and other publications have resulted from field research conducted at Cocha Cashu.&lt;ref name="Duke" /&gt;
Studies related to those done at Cocha Cashu has been conducted at nearby [[Pakitza]], on the same bank of Rio Manu, 21&amp;nbsp;km ESE. The two areas are very similar in makeup, reside at nearly the same elevation, and are not disconnected to impede species movement.&lt;ref name="Mammalian" /&gt;

===Flora===
The Rio Manu area, in 1990, was found to consist of 1,856 species of vegetation, in comparison to the 2,874 species found in the entire national park. Much of the forest is dominated by trees and shrubs, rather than having a considerable population of [[epiphytes]] and terrestrial [[herb]]s. It is thought that this inequality may be due to either lack of intensive collection of these smaller flora, or due to scarce precipitation outside of the rainy season.
[[Fabaceae|Leguminosae]] (legumes) is the outstanding family of flora species makeup, with over 90 species. ''[[Moraceae]]'', ''[[Rubiaceae]]'', and ''[[Pteridophyta]]'' follow, with over 50 documented species each. Although no particular species of flora found at the Manu site was considered [[endemism|endemic]] to the area in 1990, it was suggested that the rate of forest loss might soon have created endemism.&lt;ref name="floristic" /&gt;
Annual production of seeds and fruit is high and well supports the site's animal communities.&lt;ref name="nonflying" /&gt; It has been considered that this may be in some significant part due to the prevalence of strangler figs, which make up a high proportion of the taller trees embedded within the canopy.&lt;ref name="composition" /&gt;

===Fauna===

====Birds====
While the uncovering of the bird community dynamics of this area of the Amazon lagged behind other Amazonian sections, Cocha Cashu is considered a center of avian endemism (as identified by Haffer in 1985). Mist-net sampling of the bird populations at the site began in 1973, and by 1990, data on 435 regularly occurring species had been collected.
Insectivorous species dominate overall with 163 species, though many of these appear in the understory. Birds with a near-exclusive fruit diet numbered 58, occurring most often in canopies along with omnivores.
Common species include [[hummingbirds]], [[manakins]], and [[trumpeter (bird)|trumpeters]].&lt;ref name="bird communities" /&gt;

====Herps====
Initial studies at Cocha Cashu centered on the black caiman (''Melanosuchus niger''), and thus this is the only species of [[herpetology|herpetofauna]] thoroughly studied (as of 1990). It is thought, however, that the makeup herp communities might be very similar in Manu to that of other areas along the western Amazon Basin. Even with only the limited studies done on herpetofauna here, there appears to be a high diversity of species.&lt;ref name="herpetofauna" /&gt;

In 2008, a study was conducted on amphibians at nine sites near [[Madre de Dios Region|Madre de Dios]], one of these being Cocha Cashu. Results of this research found that 78 of the 114 species (68%) studied were found around the station, a nationally recognized protected area, while only 7.9% of the species observed were found outside of protected areas. These results stress the importance of national protection to the conservation of species diversity.&lt;ref name="amphibian conservation" /&gt;

====Mammals====
Cocha Cashu's large mammal communities, due to being within a protected park, have not felt the effects of hunting which have damaged other Neotropical communities. This makes Manu a good place to study how tropical species communities may have looked and functioned before the influx of humans and technology. This is particularly relevant when studying [[jaguars]], [[tapirs]],  [[ocelots]], [[capybaras]], [[giant otter]]s, [[spider monkeys]], [[woolly monkeys]], and [[white-lipped peccary|peccaries]], as these populations have been highly hunted elsewhere.&lt;ref name="nonflying" /&gt;
While fairly comprehensive lists of mammalian diversity at Cocha Cashu exist,&lt;ref name="Mammalian" /&gt; most are over ten years old and may not be in line with current conditions. As of 1990, 70 nonflying mammal species had been recorded at the site, the majority of these being fruit-pulp eaters. Rodents were the most common category of mammals, with 24 species. Primates consisted of 13 species, carnivores of 12 species, and marsupials of 8 species. Together, these four groups made up over 80% of total identified species. Members of the ''[[felidae]]'' family were found in surprising abundance, compared to other Neotropical sites.&lt;ref name="nonflying" /&gt;

The effect of tree gaps, an important factor in the study of tropical ecology, was studied at Cocha Cashu in reference to small mammals (rodents). No difference was found in the fruit feeding habits of either species studied between gap and understory areas, but were found to consume more fruit in the rainy season, when fruit was more abundant, than in the dry season.&lt;ref name="dynamics" /&gt;

Another paper based in the area proposes that these rodents are important assistants to the dispersal of [[mycorrhizae|mycorrhizal fungi]], an important plant [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualist]] partner, in lowland Peruvian wet forest. The discussion of this study suggests the results may be applied generally to Neotropical areas.&lt;ref name="dispersal" /&gt;

===Other Research===

An intense storm event in 1994 in Cocha Cashu's locale prompted study of the effects of such storms on tropical forests. This particular event had been the most severe recorded within the 15 years prior. Wind knocked down 40 recorded trees, not counting those that had been felled by nearby treefall. These tended to be individuals that were emergent over the canopy, and the presence of root buttresses did not appear to affect whether the individual was susceptible to toppling due to these gusts.&lt;ref name="storm" /&gt;

==History==
The Cocha Cashu Biological Station was established in the 1960s by German researchers studying [[black caiman]].  Because it is within Manú National Park, the station is officially owned and regulated by [[INRENA]], Peru's National Natural Resources Institute.  The station has been operated by [[John Terborgh]], an [[environmental science]] professor at [[Duke University]], since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/terborgh | title= Nicholas School is a School of the Environment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
The remote, rustic station consists of a few [[thatched roof]]ed buildings clustered in two small clearings, and a network of trails into the forest.  There are no dormitories or other forms of housing.  All researchers, staff, and visitors must sleep in their own tents in the surrounding forest.  Additionally, there are also no fixed plumbing systems. Toilets consist of a pair of [[pit latrines]]. Water for drinking, cooking, bathing, and washing clothes is pumped by hand from the lake.

==Access==
Cocha Cashu is only accessible by boat or [[seaplane|float plane]].  The nearest roads reach the towns of Shintuya and Atalaya, two days away by boat.  Flights to Boca Manú still require a day-long boat ride up the Manú River to reach the station.

==Dangers and Hazards==
The many hazards of the Amazonian rainforest are well-publicized, including [[piranhas]], [[anacondas]], [[caimans]], [[jaguars]], [[Cougar|pumas]], [[White-lipped Peccary|peccaries]], [[electric eels]], [[stingrays]], numerous poisonous snakes, insects, scorpions, spiders, plants, and other dangers.  However, researchers at the station have interacted closely with the plants and animals of the rainforest for decades with very few negative encounters.

One notable exception occurred on April 27, 2000, when Francis J. Bossuyt disappeared while bathing in the lake.   He has never been found, and presumed dead, perhaps killed by a caiman.  In the years since, a memorial in his name was established at the station, and more researchers and other visitors have chosen to use buckets or pumped water to bathe instead.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8897">A '''coupled human–environment system''' (known also as a '''coupled human and natural system''', or '''CHANS''') characterizes the dynamical two-way interactions between human systems (e.g., economic, social) and natural (e.g., hydrologic, atmospheric, biological, geological) systems.&lt;ref&gt;  [https://www.nsf.gov/geo/ere/ereweb/fundlisting.cfm?09560946044805114F1D4B14474914  Environmental Resource and Education Funding Opportunities], National Science Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marina11"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1890/0012-9623-92.2.218 |title=Research on Coupled Human and Natural Systems (CHANS): Approach, Challenges, and Strategies |journal=Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=218–28 |year=2011 |last1=Alberti |first1=Marina |last2=Asbjornsen |first2=Heidi |last3=Baker |first3=Lawrence A |last4=Brozovic |first4=Nicholas |last5=Drinkwater |first5=Laurie E |last6=Drzyzga |first6=Scott A |last7=Jantz |first7=Claire A |last8=Fragoso |first8=José |last9=Holland |first9=Daniel S |last10=Kohler |first10=Timothy (Tim) A |last11=Liu |first11=Jianguo (Jack) |last12=McConnell |first12=William J |last13=Maschner |first13=Herbert D.

As CHANS research is relatively new, it has not yet matured into a coherent field. Some research programs draw from, and build on, the perspectives developed in trans-discplinary fields such as [[human ecology]], [[ecological anthropology]], [[environmental geography]], [[ecological economics|economics]], as well as others. In contrast, other research programs aim to develop a more quantitative theoretic framework focusing on the development of analytical and numerical models, by building on theoretical advances in [[complex adaptive systems]], [[complexity economics]], [[dynamical system]]s theory, and the [[earth science]]s. To some extent, all CHANS programs recognize the need to move beyond traditional research methods developed in the social and natural sciences, as these are not sufficient to quantify the highly nonlinear dynamics often present in CHANS. Some research into CHANS emulates the more traditional research programs that tended to separate the social from the ecological sciences.&lt;ref name="Liu07"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1579/0044-7447(2007)36[639:chans]2.0.co;2 |jstor=25547831 |pmid=18240679 |title=Coupled Human and Natural Systems |journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment |volume=36 |issue=8 |pages=639–49 |year=2007 |last1=Liu |first1=Jianguo |last2=Dietz |first2=Thomas |last3=Carpenter |first3=Stephen R |last4=Folke |first4=Carl |last5=Alberti |first5=Marina |last6=Redman |first6=Charles L |last7=Schneider |first7=Stephen H |last8=Ostrom |first8=Elinor |last9=Pell |first9=Alice N |last10=Lubchenco |first10=Jane |last11=Taylor |first11=William W |last12=Ouyang |first12=Zhiyun |last13=Deadman |first13=Peter |last14=Kratz |first14=Timothy |last15=Provencher |first15=William }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liu07b"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1144004 |pmid=17872436 |title=Complexity of Coupled Human and Natural Systems |journal=Science |volume=317 |issue=5844 |pages=1513–6 |year=2007 |last1=Liu |first1=J |last2=Dietz |first2=T |last3=Carpenter |first3=S.

==History==
The phrase "coupled human–environment systems" appears in the earlier literature (dating back to 1999) noting that social and natural systems are inseparable.&lt;ref name="Sheppard04"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Sheppard | editor1-first=E. | editor2-last=McMaster | editor2-first=R.

'''Deborah Frances Tannen''' (born June 7, 1945) is an [[Americans|American]] [[academic]] and [[professor]] of [[linguistics]] at [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] She has been a McGraw Distinguished Lecturer at [[Princeton University]] and was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the [[Behavioural sciences|Behavioral Sciences]] following a term in residence at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton, NJ]].

Tannen is the author of twelve books, including ''[[That's Not What I Meant!]]'' and ''[[You Just Don't Understand]]'', the latter of which spent four years on the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Sellers List]], including eight consecutive months at number one.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.harpercollins.com/books/You-Just-Dont-Understand-Deborah-Tannen/?isbn=9780060959623|title=You Just Don't Understand|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709081219/http://www.harpercollins.com/books/You-Just-Dont-Understand-Deborah-Tannen/?isbn=9780060959623|archive-date=July 9, 2010|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also a frequent contributor to ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Atlantic]]'', and ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine, among other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deborahtannen.com/general-audience-articles/|title=General Audience Articles|website=Deborah Tannen|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Tannen graduated from [[Hunter College High School]] and completed her [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate studies]] at [[Binghamton University|Harpur College]] (now part of [[Binghamton University]]) with a [[Bachelor's degree|B.A.]] in [[English literature|English Literature]]. Tannen went on to earn a Masters in English Literature at [[Wayne State University]]. Later, she continued her academic studies at [[UC Berkeley]], earning an [[Master's degree|M.A.]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Linguistics.

==Writing career==
Tannen has lectured worldwide in her field, and written and edited numerous academic publications on [[linguistics]], [[discourse analysis]], and [[interpersonal communication]]. She has published many books including ''Conversational Style: Analyzing Talk Among Friends''; ''Talking Voices: Repetition, Dialogue and Imagery in Conversational Discourse''; ''Gender and Discourse''; and ''The Handbook of Discourse Analysis''. Her major theoretical contribution, presented in ''Talking Voices'', is a [[Poetry|poetics]] of [[conversation]]. She demonstrates that everyday conversation is made up of linguistic features that are traditionally regarded as literary, such as [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], [[dialogue]], and [[imagery]].

Tannen has also written several general-audience books on interpersonal communication and public discourse. She became well known in the United States after her book ''[[You Just Don't Understand]]: Women and Men in Conversation'' was published in 1990. It remained on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for nearly four years, and was subsequently translated into 30 other languages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She has written several other general-audience books and mainstream articles between 1983 and 2017.

Two of her recent books, ''You Were Always Mom's Favorite!: Sisters in Conversation Throughout Their Lives'' and ''You're Wearing THAT?: Understanding Mothers and Daughters in Conversation'' were also ''New York Times'' best-sellers. Among her other books, ''The Argument Culture'' received the Common Ground Book Award, and ''I Only Say This Because I Love You'' received a Books for a Better Life Award.

==Research==
===Overview===

Deborah Tannen's main research has focused on the expression of interpersonal relationships in conversational interaction. Tannen has explored conversational interaction and style differences at a number of different levels and as related to different situations, including differences in conversational style as connected to the [[gender]]&lt;ref name="Tannen 2003"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Handbook on Language and Gender|date=2003|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford, UK &amp; Cambridge, MA|pages=179–201|author=Deborah Tanne|editor1=J. Holmes |editor2=M. Meyerhoff |chapter=Gender and Family Interaction}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cultural background,&lt;ref name="Tannen 1981"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Indirectness in Discourse: Ethnicity as Conversational Style|journal=Discourse Processes|date=1981|volume=4|series=1981|issue=3|pages=221–238|author=Deborah Tannen|doi=10.1080/01638538109544517}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as speech that is tailored for specific listeners based on the speaker's social role.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2000"&gt;{{cite book|title=Language in Action: New Studies of Language in Society|date=2000|publisher=Hampton Press|location=Cresskill, NJ|pages=189–249|author=Deborah Tannen|editor1=J. Peyton |editor2=P. Griffin |editor3=W. Wolfram |editor4=R. Fasold |chapter=Indirectness at Work}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, Tannen has done extensive gender-linked research and writing that focused on miscommunications between men and women; however, some linguists have argued against Tannen's claims from a feminist standpoint.&lt;ref name="previous"&gt;{{cite book|title=Key Thinkers in Linguistics and the Philosophy of Language|date=2005|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburg|accessdate=1 October 2012|chapter=DEBORAH TANNEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tannen's research began when she analyzed her friends while working on her Ph.D. Since then, she has collected several naturally occurring conversations on tape&lt;ref name="Tannen 1987"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psycholinguistic Models of Production|date=1987|publisher=Ablex|location=Norwood, NJ|pages=251–267|author=Deborah Tannen|chapter=Conversational Style}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conducted interviews as forms of data for later analysis. She has also compiled and analyzed information from other researchers in order to draw out notable trends in various types of conversations, sometimes borrowing and expanding on their terminology to emphasize new points of interest.

===Gender differences in US family interaction===
Tannen highlighted the "Telling Your Day" ritual that takes place in many U.S. families, in which, typically, the mother in a two-parent family encourages a child to share details (about their day which the mother has typically already heard about) with the father.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2003" /&gt; She also emphasizes the common occurrence of the "troubles talk" ritual in women.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2003" /&gt; This ritual involves a woman sharing details about "a frustrating experience" or other previously encountered problem with a confidant. She cites this ritual of an example of how, for many women, closeness is established through sharing personal details.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2003" /&gt; As one example of gender-linked [[Language interpretation|misinterpretations]], Tannen points out that a man who is on the receiving end of "troubles talk" from his wife will often take the mention of a problem and how it was handled as an invitation to pass judgment, despite the fact that "troubles talk" is simply an expository experience meant to enhance emotional connections.

===Interplay of connection maneuvers and power maneuvers in family conversations===
Tannen once described family discourse as "a prime example…of the nexus of needs for both [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[Rapport|connection]] in human relationships.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2003" /&gt; She coined the term "connection maneuvers" to describe interactions that take place in the closeness dimension of the traditional model of power and connection&lt;!-- What was "Figure 1" now deleted --&gt;; this term is meant to contrast with the "control maneuvers," which, according to psychologists Millar, Rogers, and Bavelas, take place in the power dimension of the same model.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2003" /&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Unidimensional view of power and connection (linguistics).jpg.png|thumb|left|'''Figure 1:''' Unidimensional view of power and connection{{deletable image-caption|Sunday, 20 August 2017|F7}}]] --&gt;

Tannen challenged the conventional view of power ([[hierarchy]]) and connection ([[solidarity]]) as "unidimensional and mutually exclusive" and offered her own kind of model for mapping the interplay of these two aspects of communication, which takes the form of a two-dimensional grid (Figure 1). [[File:Tannen Power vs. Connection Grid.png|thumb|right|'''Figure 1:''' Tannen's Power vs. Connection grid.]]

In this model, the vertical axis represents the level of power in the interaction, and the horizontal axis represents connection. Having presented this model, Tannen proposed that in the American paradigm, a sibling relationship would be mapped in the bottom left [[Quadrant (plane geometry)|quadrant]], as there is a high level of closeness and a relative equality that is not comparable to the power dynamic in an American parent/child relationship.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2003" /&gt; Using this new model, Tannen argues that connection maneuvers do not only occur independently of control maneuvers. Among other examples, she mentions a wife who refuses to let her [[husband]] take over making popcorn by saying "You always burn it".&lt;ref name="Tannen 2003" /&gt; According to Tannen, the wife's resistance to her husband's request is a control maneuver, but by citing a potential undesirable effect for her family (i.e. burnt popcorn), she ties a connection maneuver into her attempt to enforce a decision.

Tannen also highlights ventriloquizing – which she explains as a "phenomenon by which a person speaks not only for another but also as another"&lt;ref name="Tannen 2001"&gt;{{cite book|title=Linguistics, Language, and the Real World: Discourse and Beyond: Georgetown University Round Table on Languages and Linguistics|date=2001|publisher=Georgetown University Press|location=Washington, DC|pages=50–61|author=Deborah Tannen|editor1=D. Tannen |editor2=J. E. Alatis |chapter=Power maneuvers or connection maneuvers? Ventriloquizing in family interaction}}&lt;/ref&gt; – as a strategy for integrating connection maneuvers into other types of interactions. As an example of this, she cites an exchange recorded by her research team in which a mother attempts to convince her son to pick up his toys by ventriloquizing the family's dogs: "[extra high pitch] We're naughty, but we're not as naughty as Jared".&lt;ref name="Tannen 2001" /&gt;

===Conversational style===
Deborah Tannen describes the notion of conversational style as "a semantic process" and "the way meaning is encoded in and derived from speech".&lt;ref name="Tannen 1987" /&gt; She cites the work of R. Lakoff and J. Gumperz as the inspiration behind her thinking. According to Tannen, some features of conversational style are topic (which includes type of topics and how transitions occur), genre (storytelling style), pace (which includes rate of speech, occurrence or lack of pauses, and overlap), and expressive paralinguistics (pitch/amplitude shifts and other changes in voice quality).&lt;ref name="Tannen 1987" /&gt;

==="High-involvement" vs. "high-considerateness"===
Based on a two-and-a-half hour recording of Thanksgiving dinner conversations with friends, Tannen analyzed the two prevailing conversational styles among the six participants, which she divided evenly between the categories of [[New York City|New York]]er and non-New Yorker.&lt;ref name="Tannen 1987" /&gt; Upon analyzing the recording, Tannen came to the conclusion that the speech of the New Yorkers was characterized by exaggerated intonations ([[Paralanguage|paralinguistics]]), overlapping speech between two or more speakers, short silences, and machine-gun questions, which she defines as questions that are "uttered quickly, timed to overlap or latch onto another's talk, and characterized by reduced syntactic form".&lt;ref name="Tannen 1987" /&gt; The style of the non-New Yorkers was opposite that of the New Yorkers in all regards mentioned above; furthermore, the non-New Yorkers were caught off-guard by the New Yorkers' exaggerated intonation and interrupting questions, two factors that discouraged them from finishing their conversations at some points.&lt;ref name="Tannen 1987" /&gt; Tannen refers to the New Yorkers' style as "high-involvement" and the unimposing style of the non-New Yorkers as "high-considerateness".&lt;ref name="Tannen 1987" /&gt;

===Indirectness in work situations===
Tannen has expressed her stance against taking indirect speech as a sign of weakness or as a lack of confidence; she also set out to debunk the idea that [[Americans|American]] women are generally more indirect than men.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2000" /&gt; She reached this conclusion by looking through transcripts of conversations and interviews, as well as through correspondence with her readers. One example she uses against the second idea comes from a letter from a reader, who mentioned how his Navy superior trained his unit to respond to the indirect request "It's hot in this room" as a direct request to open the window.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2000" /&gt; A different letter mentions the tendency of men to be more indirect when it comes to expressing feelings than women.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2000" /&gt;

Tannen also mentions exchanges where both participants are male, but the two participants are not of equal social status. As a specific example, she mentions a "black box" recording between a plane captain and a co-pilot in which the captain's failure to understand the co-pilot's indirect conversational style (which was likely a result of his relatively inferior rank) caused a crash.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2000" /&gt;

===Indirectness as a sociocultural norm===
During a trip to [[Greece]], Tannen observed that comments she had made to her hosts about foods she had not seen yet in Greece (specifically, scrambled eggs and grapes) had been interpreted as indirect requests for the foods.&lt;ref name="Tannen 1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tannen|first=Deborah|title=Communication mix and mixup, or how linguistics can ruin a marriage|journal=San Jose State Occasional Paper in Linguistics|date=1975|pages=205–211}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was surprising to her, since she had just made the comments in the spirit of small talk. Tannen observed this same tendency of [[Greek people|Greeks]] and [[Greek American|Greek-Americans]] to interpret statements indirectly in a study&lt;ref name="Tannen 1981" /&gt; that involved interpreting the following conversation between a husband and a wife:

:{{Dialogue
|Wife|John's having a party. Wanna go?
|Husband|Okay.
|action|later|Wife|Are you sure you want to go to the party?
|Husband|Okay, let's not go. I'm tired anyway.
}}

The participants – some Greeks, some Greek-Americans, and some non-Greek Americans – had to choose between the following two paraphrases of the second line in the exchange:

:{{Dialogue
|[1-I]|My wife wants to go to this party, since she asked. I'll go to make her happy.
|[1-D]|My wife is asking if I want to go to a party. I feel like going, so I'll say yes.
}}

Tannen's findings showed that 48% of Greeks chose the first (more indirect) paraphrase, while only 32% of non-Greek Americans chose the same one, with the Greek-Americans scoring closer to the Greeks than the other Americans at 43%. These percentages, combined with other elements of the study, suggest that the degree of indirectness a listener generally expects may be affected through sociocultural norms.

===Agonism in written academic discourse===
Tannen analyzed the agonistic framing of academic texts, which are characterized by their "ritualized adversativeness".&lt;ref name="Tannen 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tannen|first=Deborah|title=Agonism in academic discourse|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|date=2002|pages=1651–1669|doi=10.1016/s0378-2166(02)00079-6|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argued that expectations for academic papers in the US place the highest importance on presenting the weaknesses of an existing, opposing, argument as a basis for bolstering the author's replacement argument.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2002" /&gt; According to her, agonism limits the depth of arguments and learning, since authors who follow the convention pass up opportunities to acknowledge strengths in the texts they are arguing against; in addition, this places the newest, attention-grabbing works in prime positions to be torn apart.&lt;ref name="Tannen 2002" /&gt;

'''Desecularization''' is a sociological term that describes the proliferation or growth of religion, usually after a period of prior [[secularization]]. The theory of desecularization is reactionary to the older theory known as The Secularization Thesis, which referred to the gradual decline religion to a point of extinction. In the last few decades, scholars have gestured to continued church attendance in Western countries, the rise in religious [[fundamentalism]] and the prevalence of religious conflict as evidence of the continued relevance of religion in the modern world.&lt;ref name="Berger_page2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The desecularization of the world : resurgent religion and world politics|last=Berger|first=Peter|publisher=Ethics and Public Policy Center|others=|year=1999|isbn=978-0802846914|location=Washington, D.C.|page=2|oclc=41445734}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former proponent of the earlier secularization thesis, Peter Berger, has now expressed his support for the newer theory, stating that the "world today... is as furiously religious as it ever was.”&lt;ref name="Berger_page2"/&gt; 

== Background ==
Many scholars of the 19th century posited that the world was undergoing a process of [[secularization]]. Individuals such as Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, Karl Marx and Sigmund Freud believed that this trend would continue until religion became essentially insignificant in the public sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religion in the contemporary world : a sociological introduction|last=Aldridge|first=Alan|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780745653464|edition= Third|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=Chapter 4|oclc=812687263}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the least it was believed that religion would become "privatized."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The sociological imagination|last=Mills|first=Charles Wright|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=9780199761128|location=Oxford [England]|pages=33|oclc=610027153}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secularization thesis was underscored by [[rationalism]], an argument born from the Enlightenment Era.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sacred Canopy : Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion.|last=L.|first=Berger, Peter|date=2011|publisher=Open Road Media|isbn=978-1306601580|oclc=877050176}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Norris and Inglehart, the traditional view of 19th century secularization can be divided into two perspectives (1) 'Demand-Side theories' and (2) 'Supply Side Theories.'&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sacred and secular : religion and politics worldwide|last=Norris|first=Pippa|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Inglehart, Ronald.|year=2011|isbn=9781139128674|edition= 2nd|location=Cambridge|pages=Chapter 1|oclc=767732041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 'Demand Side' theories ===
Demand Side theories of secularization insist that the phenomenon occurs "bottom up," such that as a whole, the general population will become increasingly rational independent of any influence from the secular government or religious leadership body.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Examples of Demand Side theories can be found in the accounts given by Weber and Durkheim. Whilst Weber rarely actually used the term "secularization," he is generally given credit for alluding to the idea that religion was gradually losing its prominence in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism|last=1864-1920.|first=Weber, Max|date=2008|publisher=BN Publishing|others=Parsons, Talcott, 1902-1979,, Tawney, R. H. (Richard Henry), 1880-1962.|isbn=9781607960980|location=[Place of publication not identified]|oclc=657328726}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Weber, the world was initially seen as unified such that religion, politics and economics all existed on the same social plane, meaning that the term "religion" was actually not necessary nor was it widely used because it was encompassed in all aspects of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughey|first=Michael W.|date=1979|title=The idea of secularization in the works of max weber: A theoretical outline|journal=Qualitative Sociology|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=85–111|doi=10.1007/bf02390135|issn=0162-0436}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Weber, when different aspects of society such as politics and economics became severed from religion, this started an inevitable demise such that religion would become extinct in the public sphere.

=== 'Supply Side' theories ===
Supply Side theories of secularization argue that the demand for religion exerted by the general population remains constant. This means that any change in the religious landscape occurs as a result of the manipulation of the "supply market" by religious leaders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The construction therefore views the phenomenon as 'top down' development. Bruce argues that the "supply" of religion is greatest when there is a "free" and "competitive" market for "providers" of religion, as in most Western nations, as opposed to states where one religion predominates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=God is Dead: Secularization in the West|last=Bruce|first=Steve|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2002|isbn=9780631232759|location=|pages=Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Sociology Literature ==

=== Terminology and Definition ===
The term "Desecularization" appears in the title of Peter Berger's seminal work ''The Desecularization of the World: Resurgent Religion and World Politics.'' According to Karpov, the term has received little analysis in the field of sociology,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karpov|first=V.|date=2010-03-01|title=Desecularization: A Conceptual Framework|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcs/article/52/2/232/781896|journal=Journal of Church and State|language=en|volume=52|issue=2|pages=232–270, 232|doi=10.1093/jcs/csq058|issn=0021-969X|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however this section will refer to at least one significant development in the term’s definition since its first use. '' ''

Berger explains that the assumption that the modern world is secular has been “falsified."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Desecularization of the World|last=Berger|first=Peter|publisher=The Ethics and Public Policy Centre|year=1999|isbn=|location=Washington, D. C.|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another article online, he acknowledges that his original use of the term simply referred to “the continuing strong presence of religion in the modern world.”&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/05/13/desecularization/|title=Desecularization - The American Interest|date=2015-05-13|work=The American Interest|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karpov has since developed the definition of the term, which Berger subsequently affirmed. Karpov defines the term as referring to a phenomenon that is counter-secularization and thus is reactionary to a prior period of secularism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karpov|first=Vyacheslav|date=|title=Desecularization: A Conceptual Framework|jstor=23921866|journal=Journal of Church and State|volume=52|pages=237|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that Desecularization can be defined as "the growth of religion's societal influence," but only if it develops in response to "previously secularizing trends."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Therefore, Karpov's development of the term essentially limited the definition to instances where religion was actively re-established as opposed to simply a state of continuity.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Methodological concerns ===
Some scholars raise the issue of evidence. Karpov for example, mounts a discussion on the different analytics that can be used in providing evidence for desecularizing trends.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karpov|first=Vyacheslav|date=2010|title=Desecularization: A Conceptual Framework|jstor=23921866|journal=Journal of Church and State|volume=52|pages=259–263|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He divides these analytics into two different types of evidence, (1) societal-level data or "macro-data" and (2) non-societal data, named in Karpov’s article as “mega data." Macro-data deals with evidence obtained from individual societal “units.” These units cannot exclusively be referred to as countries or nation-states because sometimes they can represent smaller sections, i.e. racial groups. Other data ("mega-data") is less objective according to Karpov, because it often refers to trends in more abstract terms such as in “modern society” or civilization generally.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Essentially, mega-date data attempts to identify patterns on a more cosmic or global scale, whereas macro data can be very specific to nations, cities and racial groups such as church attendance and census results.  

Because the term Desecularization has been used to describe a global trend,&lt;ref name="Berger_page2" /&gt; the question raised by Karpov is whether macro-data analytics can be considered as valid when they indicate specific trends in “societal units,” rather than global trends.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There are two primary critiques of macro analytics: (1) that it leads to “methodological nationalism,” causing a fixation on nation-states rather than broader civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What is Globalization|last=Beck|first=Ulrich|publisher=Polity Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Malden|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next argument is that of (2) temporal limitation – the concern that because our current concept of “society” is relatively recent, a focus on societal-level analytics (macro data) restricts sociological analysis to modernity and no other time period. According to Karpov this poses an issue when considering religions with ancient historical trajectories.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 

Karpov also cites several implications that result from using “mega” analytics, overall suggesting that it can allow for an understanding of desecularization that is rooted both in its historical trajectory, and its presence in modernity.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; He concludes that whilst “macro” data can limit the analysis of desecularization, it can be compounded and used in conjunction with “mega” analytics to give sociologists a clear overall picture of a religious trend. 

== Examples ==

=== Church attendance in America ===
Finke and Stark state that church attendance in America from 1776 to 2000 has in fact increased from 17% of the population to 62% of the population.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Churching of America|last=Finke|first=Roger|last2=Stark|first2=Rodney|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=New Brunswick|pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the religious landscape in the 20th and 21st centuries only appear to be fading in significance because traditional routes of religious worship are being replaced by new wave religiosity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Finally, they claim that populations in the modern world are moving away from traditional or established denominations such as Catholicism and participating in religious affairs in a more individualized sense.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, Finke and Stark argue that the colonial period in America was not as religious as once thought, using church attendance as an indicator of religiosity. Instead they suggest that the onset of globalization and religious pluralism is responsible for a higher proportion of church involvement when compared with the monolithic, traditional histories of the mainstream churches.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=What is Globalization?|last=Beck|first=Ulrich|publisher=Polity Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=Malden|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Orthodox Christianity in Russia ===
Christopher Marsh explains the secularization in Russia before the collapse of the Soviet Union, stating that the regime was underscored by “scientific atheism,” which was ultimately manifested in the persecution of religious clergy in Russia throughout the duration of the regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Religion and the state in Russia and China : suppression, survival, and revival|last=1969-|first=Marsh, Christopher|date=2011|publisher=Continuum|isbn=9781441102294|location=New York|pages=175|oclc=641998840}}&lt;/ref&gt; This secularization was indicated in the surveys conducted between 1981 and 1990, that showed a sharp decline in religious and supernatural beliefs, particularly in young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lambert|first=Yves|date=2006|title=Trends in Religious Feeling in Europe and Russia|url=|journal=Revue Française de Sociologie|volume=47|pages=99–129|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lambert's study, 12 variables were used in the survey to denote religiosity, which included propensity to pray, belief in an afterlife etc. Furthermore, in a study conducted by Evans and Northmore-Ball, 80 percent of individuals claimed to be Russian Orthodox in 2007, with only half of the population doing the same in 1993, immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Geoffrey|last2=Northmore-Ball|first2=Ksenia|date=2012|title=The Limits of Secularization? The Resurgence of Orthodoxy in Post-Soviet Russia|url=|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|volume=51|pages=799|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Berger and Karpov use this evidence to bolster their accounts of Desecularization in the present.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Desecularization in East Asia ===
Zeng discusses the increasingly religious paradigm within civil service entrance examinations - tests which are intended to sort applicants for civil service and "justify social hierarchy," as well as academic examinations for school and university.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeng|first=Kangmin|date=1996|title=Prayer, Luck, and Spiritual Strength: The Desecularization of Entrance Examination|url=|journal=Comparative Education Review|volume=40|pages=264–279|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study uses [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] evidence and interviews with civil servants to provide evidence for this phenomenon. Zeng highlights the systemic use of ''emas'' - prayer symbols that are used in Shintoism and other East-Asian religions, to invoke positive outcomes in entrance exams. According to Zeng, these are sufficiently prevalent in some parts of Japan such that individual universities such as Keio University in Tokyo, offer their own prayer templates for prospective students.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Zeng also found that in two separate non-academic shrines in Japan, more than half of the ''emas'' were directed toward such exams.            

== The Debate ==
So far this article has suggested that The Secularization Thesis was the sociological predecessor of Desecularization, which is a more contemporary sociological theory. However, the secularization-desecularization dichotomy is still surrounded by much debate in regards to its application to modernity. Some contemporary scholars in the 20th and 21st century have argued that the Secularization Thesis is not nullified and that the term 'desecularization' can only be applied in isolated, societal circumstances. Wilson has suggested that commercialism continues to undermine religion in relation to religious bodies such as the Church, and non-religious bodies such as the family unit and economic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Companion to Sociology of Religion|last=Wilson|first=Bryan|last2=Fenn|first2=RK (ed.)|publisher=Blackwell|year=2001|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=Part 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critics of the contemporary theory of desecularization such as Wilson, still concede that religiosity is not trending towards extinction because of continued religious piety across the globe. However, they do argue that its relationship with political and economic institutions is indeed subject to a continued decline because of the increased pressure from the scientific and technological spheres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mouzelis|first=Nicos|date=2012|title=Modernity and the Secularization Debate|url=|journal=Sociology|volume=46|pages=207–223|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue not only that this proposition is plausible in modernity, but that it still compatible with 19th century conceptions of Secularization that foreshadowed its "privatization," if not extinction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hence, critics of Desecularization suggest that whilst it can account for some instances of continued and revised religiosity, it does not adequately describe the relationship between religion and privatized inquisitions and governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mouzelis|first=Nicos|date=2012|title=Modernity and the Secularization Debate|url=|journal=Sociology|volume=46|pages=210|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Mouzelis suggests that this case is "strong," however it only refers to "inter-institutional" secularization (i.e. the relationship between religion and other institutions).&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mouzelis|first=Nicos|date=2012|title=Modernity and the Secularization Debate|url=|journal=Sociology|volume=46|pages=211–213|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He offers the opinion that the argument against Desecularization becomes weakened when one considers "developments within the religious sphere proper," or what he calls, "intra-institutional" secularization.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Similarly, Martin uses evidence of increased [[Pentecostalism]] in both developed and non-developed countries (particularly the U.S) to bolster the argument for Desecularization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=On Secularization: Towards a Revised General Theory|last=Martin|first=D|publisher=Ashgate|year=2005|isbn=|location=Aldershot|pages=26–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce offers a rebuttal to this point, claiming that The United States is simply slower to become secular due to certain structural predispositions, namely the steady rate of migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Secularization: In Defense of an Unfashionable Theory|last=Bruce|first=Steve|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=180–200}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bruce also suggests that the dramatic changes to religiosity in the modern world such as increased liberalism, represent evidence of its decline. According to Bruce, this trajectory could have begun with the transition from medieval Catholicism to the Protestant reformation under Martin Luther.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Secularization: In Defense of an Unfashionable Theory|last=Bruce|first=Steve|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mouzelis describes this as a potentially weak argument in that most proponents of Desecularization would simply view events such as the Reformation as a religious development or the birth of a new type of Christianity, which could have the potential to further globalize its consumption.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  

Among these dramatic changes in religion, according to Bruce, is the deterioration of supernatural elements of religiosity, leaving behind a belief system that its more morally grounded a development which represents a "retardation" of religion.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Again, Mouzelis takes a more objective stance, suggesting that this development can be seen as both evidence for and against Desecularization because such movements can still capitulate the globalization of certain faiths.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;   

Overall, critics of desecularization tend to argue that whilst religious enthusiasm is not necessarily in decline, the significance of religion in the public sphere, and as a limb of political and economic institutions, is indeed continually diminished by modernity. This can be described as the "privatization" of religion. However, desecularization proponents tend to suggest that these aforementioned changes represent religious developments rather than religious declines, and therefore cannot be used as evidence of general secularizing trend.

[[Image:ETplazaAtbrenics.jpg|thumb|right|ICS buildings (center and left) viewed from the top of Bren Hall]]The '''Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences''', also known colloquially as UCI's '''School of ICS''' or simply the '''Bren School''', is an academic unit of [[University of California, Irvine]] (UCI), and the only dedicated school of [[computer science]] in the [[University of California]] system. Consisting of nearly three thousand students, faculty, and staff,&lt;ref name="factsfigures"&gt;https://www.ics.uci.edu/about/about_factsfigures.php&lt;/ref&gt; the school maintains three buildings in the South-East artery of UCI's undergraduate campus, and maintains student body and research affiliations throughout UCI.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;&lt;ref name="enrollment"&gt;{{cite web |website=UC Irvine |url=http://www.oir.uci.edu/enr/IIA01-total-enr-by-level-2006-07.pdf |format=PDF |title=Headcounts by Academic Unit and Level, Fall 2006 |accessdate=February 15, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090115213922/http://www.oir.uci.edu/enr/IIA01-total-enr-by-level-2006-07.pdf |archivedate=January 15, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school of ICS consists of three departments: Computer Science, [[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]], and [[Statistics]]. The combined groupings focus the school around the fields of [[computing]] and processing of information. The departments confer eight undergraduate, eleven masters, and seven doctoral degrees in total, with some degree programs cooperating with affiliated schools.&lt;ref name="degrees"/&gt;

== History ==

Beginning in 1968, three years after UCI's founding, the Department of Information and Computer Science was created as an independent department, not belonging to any school. In 2002, the 35-year-old department was elevated to the status of a school, and its faculty were partitioned into two departments, the Department of Computer Science and the Department of Informatics. The Department of Statistics, founded earlier in 2002, was included as a third department in the newly created school.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2004, the school received a $20 million anonymous donation. The donation was later revealed to be from [[Donald Bren]], a wealthy [[real estate developer]] and head of the [[Irvine Company]]. The school was renamed in his honor. The donation is primarily being used to seek out and seed prestigious researchers.&lt;ref name="bren"&gt;http://www.ics.uci.edu/about/bren/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academics ==

The school of ICS is one of less than fifty independent computer science schools in the United States, and the only one in the University of California system.&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;

The ''US News and World Report'' ranks Bren School as 29th in the United States for Computer Science {{as of|2016|lc=on}},&lt;ref&gt;http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/university-of-california-irvine-110653/overall-rankings&lt;/ref&gt; and 14th in public university programs. Among some ICS subareas, the school is ranked 4th in human-computer interaction, 9th in software engineering, and 8th in databases.&lt;ref name="factsfigures"/&gt;

===Undergraduate===
The school possesses 8 undergraduate majors, ranging from lower level hardware to high level social computing, each providing a [[bachelor of science]] degree (notably, Computer Engineering is not part of ICS, and resides in the [[Henry Samueli School of Engineering]]). Out of the 8 undergraduate majors in the Donald Bren School, 3 are unique interdisciplinary studies shared between the Paul Merage School of Business, the Henry Samueli School of Engineering, and the School of Biological Sciences. The majors that are available include Biomedical Computing, Business Information Management, Computer Game Science, Computer Science, Computer Science &amp; Engineering, Informatics, Information and Computer Science, and Software Engineering.

Non-interdisciplinary majors are:

*The school's primary major is Information and Computer Science, focused on computer science theory and software engineering. In contrast to engineering majors, additional natural sciences (such as physics) are not required to complete the major. Two upper division theoretical mathematics courses are required, along with basic calculus, linear algebra, statistics, and discrete mathematics. The program allows students more freedom to pursue a selected field in computer science. Though not required for a degree, the school certifies specializations within the major:&lt;ref name="degrees"/&gt;
**[[Artificial intelligence|Artificial Intelligence]]
**[[Computer systems|Computer Systems]]
**Implementation and Analysis of Algorithms
**[[Information system|Information Systems]]
**[[Computer network|Networks and Distributed Systems]]
**[[Software system|Software Systems]]
* The second most popular major within the school is Computer Science, similar in composition to ICS. Though more limiting in electives, the major was formed around the recommended courses set by [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] and [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]], and features a more classical computer science curriculum.&lt;ref name="degrees"&gt;Bren School, [http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/degrees/index.php?track=cs Undergraduate degrees], 12 March 2012. URL accessed June 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Informatics]], a major unique in the UC system.&lt;ref name=informaticsdegree&gt;{{cite web|title=Undergraduate degree in Informatics|url=http://www.ics.uci.edu/ugrad/degrees/degree_in4matx.php|accessdate=13 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The higher level of social abstraction prepares students in such fields as software analysis, management, design, and interfaces.&lt;ref name="degrees"/&gt;

Undergraduate interdisciplinary majors are:
* Computer Science and Engineering - hosted jointly by The Henry Samueli School of Engineering and The Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Science.&lt;ref name="cse major"&gt;UC Irvine, [http://www.editor.uci.edu/06-07/ics/ics.3.htm#gen2 Undergraduate Major in Computer Science and Engineering], 2006. URL accessed December 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Business Information Management (BIM) is administered by the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences as an interdisciplinary degree program with The Paul Merage School of Business.
* Biomedical Computing (BMC)

=== Graduate ===
ICS provides 11 master's level and 7 doctorate level graduate programs. Since computing is a part of many other fields (which use or interact with computing technology), ICS collaborates with other schools in many of its programs.&lt;ref name="grad"&gt;Bren School, [http://www.ics.uci.edu/grad/ Graduate Studies], ''Information on all the degrees offered by the school'', 20 October 2006. URL accessed December 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Computer Science offers a general major to those who have no specialized field, and is awarded as Information and Computer Science (M.S.). Computer Science (M.S.,Ph.D.) allows for a wide range of fields, similar to the general degree; however, doctoral degrees require a particular research interest within the field, unlike the general degree. [[Embedded Systems]] (M.S.) more narrowly focuses students on the implementation of specialized computer systems. Knowledge Discovery and Data (M.S.) applies to informatics fields like [[information processing]] and to computer science fields such as [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref name="grad"/&gt;

The Department of Informatics offers its own general degree Informatics Track in General Informatics (M.S.,Ph.D.), however doctoral candidates must have a specific research interest.
Informatics Track in Interactive and Collaborative Technology (M.S.,Ph.D.) narrows its general degree to the field of [[human–computer interaction]], with end parties as wholly human or man and machine. [[Software engineering]] is researched under the Informatics Track in Software (M.S.,Ph.D.) degree, as software development processes are directly related to human interaction and information systems.&lt;ref name="grad"/&gt;

Three multi-discipline fields exist, spread across more than one school. Networked Systems (M.S.,Ph.D.)  involves both the School of Engineering and the school of ICS. The research area covers high and low levels of telecommunications and computer networks. Arts Computation Engineering (M.S.), as its name suggests, covers both the School of Engineering and the [[Claire Trevor School of the Arts]] in addition to ICS. The field relies heavily on high level informatics principles, applying science to the arts. Informatics in Biology &amp; Medicine (M.S.,Ph.D.), requires classes within the wide fields of Biology. Research may range from microscopic systems, such as proteins, or macro-level systems, such as populations.&lt;ref name="grad"/&gt;

Though the Department of Statistics currently has no undergraduate degrees, it offers one graduate program: Statistics (M.S.,Ph.D.). The graduate program may help model many different problems, and is highly applicable to researchers in other fields such as economics and biology.&lt;ref name="grad"/&gt;

== People ==

* communicate clearly and promote public understanding of social science.

==History==
The ESRC was founded in 1965 as the ''Social Science Research Council'' (SSRC - not to be confused with the [[Social Science Research Council]] in the United States). The establishment of a state [[funding body]] for the social sciences in the United Kingdom, had been under discussion since the [[World War II|Second World War]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = ESRC's history|publisher = ESRC|date = December 2015|url = http://www.esrc.ac.uk/about-us/what-we-do/our-history/|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was not until the 1964 election of Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] that the political climate for the creation of the SSRC became sufficiently favourable.

The first chief executive of the SSRC was [[Michael Young (politician)|Michael Young]] (later Baron Young of Dartington). Subsequent holders of the post have included [[Michael Posner (economist)|Michael Posner]], later Secretary General of the [[European Science Foundation]]. The current Chief Executive of the ESRC is [https://esrc.ukri.org/about-us/governance-and-structure/directors/jennifer-rubin/ Professor Jennifer Rubin] who took over from Professor [[Jane Elliott (academic)|Jane Elliott]] in October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = King's Professor Jennifer Rubin appointed ESRC Chief Executive|publisher = KCL|url = https://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/policy-institute/news/newsrecords/2017/King's-Professor-Jennifer-Rubin-appointed-ESRC-Chief-Executive.aspx|accessdate = 2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;


===Change of name===
Following the election of Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the 1979 general election, the Government expressed reservations about the value of research in the social sciences, and the extent to which it should be publicly funded. In 1981, the Education Secretary [[Keith Joseph|Sir Keith Joseph]] asked [[Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild|Lord Rothschild]] to lead a review into the future of the SSRC.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

It was ultimately decided (due in no small part to the efforts of Michael Posner, chief executive of the SSRC at the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Michael Posner Obituary|publisher = The Independent|date = April 2009|url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/michael-posner-6107063.html|accessdate = 2015-12-03|location = London|first = Michael|last = Kuczynski}}&lt;/ref&gt;) that the Council should remain, but that its remit should be expanded beyond the social sciences, to include more 'empirical' research and research of 'more public concern'. To reflect this, in 1983 the SSRC was renamed the Economic and Social Research Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = SSRC/ESRC: the first forty years|publisher = ESRC|url = http://www.esrc.ac.uk/files/news-events-and-publications/publications/ssrc-and-esrc-the-first-forty-years/|accessdate = 2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7815">[[Image:FHI logo PMS2745 .png|right]]The '''Franklin Humanities Institute (FHI)''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] humanities center at [[Duke University]] dedicated to supporting [[humanities]], arts, and social science research and teaching.  The institute's mission is to encourage humanistic inquiry throughout Duke campus and to raise public awareness of the humanities.  Named after the prominent African American historian and civil rights activist [[John Hope Franklin]], who retired from Duke in 1985 as the James B. Duke professor of History, the institute has also made a commitment to promote scholarship that enhances social equity, especially through research on race and ethnicity.
The Franklin Humanities Institute is part of a consortium of interdisciplinary research centers and institutes at Duke University. It was formerly located at the John Hope Franklin Center for Interdisciplinary and International Studies at Duke, and is now located in the historic Smith Warehouse on Duke's East Campus.

== History ==
The Franklin Humanities Institute was founded in 1999 by [[Cathy Davidson]], then Vice Provost for interdisciplinary Studies, and Karla FC Holloway, former Dean of the Humanities and Social Sciences.  In 2002, the Institute received a three-year grant from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] for a project entitled "Making the Humanities Central." The grant was renewed for a second three-year cycle in 2005.

In Spring 2007, the FHI became the new administrative headquarters of the [[Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes (CHCI)]], an international organization that supports interdisciplinary humanities scholarship and institution-building.  Prior to moving to Duke, the CHCI was based at Harvard University.

[[Srinivas Aravamudan]] was the Director of the FHI before he took the position as Dean of Humanities at Duke University in 2009. Ian Baucom was the Director of the FHI before he took the position of Buckner W. Clay Dean of Arts and Sciences at the University of Virginia in 2014. David Bell is serving as Interim Director of the FHI in 2014-15.

In Fall 2010 the FHI moved to the renovated Smith Warehouse on Duke's East Campus, near the heart of Durham's historic Downtown district.  The Warehouse is home to the Humanities Laboratories initiative, which aims to contribute to Duke's research and pedagogical missions by convening groups of faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates around discipline-crossing projects, in spaces designed specifically to facilitate collaborative work. Complementing historic strengths in supporting faculty and graduate scholarship (notably through the twelve Annual Seminars they hosted between 1999 and 2011), the Labs invite undergraduates to participate as researchers themselves, helping to define emerging and future areas of humanistic inquiry. Since 2011-12, the Lab initiative became a key element of Humanities Writ Large, a major university-wide Mellon Foundation grant. In 2012-13 the undergraduate-focused Labs were joined by the PhD Lab in Digital Knowledge.

In 2014-15 the FHI inaugurates the Seminars in Historical, Global, and Emerging Humanities, a major new initiative generously funded by the Mellon Foundation. The grant explores the states and directions of humanities disciplines in light of the interdisciplinary developments in recent decades, through an expansive set of partnerships with Duke's humanities and interpretive social sciences departments and non-departmental units.

== Programs ==
The Franklin Humanities Institute sponsors an annual residential seminar consisting of Duke faculty, graduate research fellows, a post-doctoral fellow, and professional staff at the university (e.g. librarians, IT specialist). Conceived as a "laboratory" for humanists from diverse disciplines, each annual seminar focuses on a theme or problem with broad historical, philosophical, or geographical scope.  To date, there have been seminars organized around two general areas: "Race" (1999–2003) and "Art, Ideas, and Information" (2004–08). The 2007-08 seminar, Recycle, explored the appropriation of cultural products in different contexts.  This seminar was co-convened by [[Neil De Marchi]] (Professor of Economics), [[Mark Anthony Neal]] (Associate Professor or African and African American Studies), and Annabel J. Wharton (William B. Hamilton Professor of Art, Art History and Visual Studies).

In 2011 The Franklin Humanities Institute began sponsoring Interdisciplinary Humanities Labs, with later support from the Mellon Foundation's Humanities Writ Large grant. These limited-term labs include dedicated space in the historic Smith Warehouse home of the FHI, and are organized around a research area and specific projects and promote vertical integration among undergraduates, graduates, and faculty. These have included the Haiti Lab, the GreaterThanGames: Transmedia Applications, Virtual Worlds, and Digital Storytelling Lab, the BorderWorks Lab, the Global Brazil Lab, the AudioVisualities Lab, and the PhD Lab in Digital Knowledge.

In addition to the Annual Seminar, the Franklin Humanities Institute also runs a dissertation working group for graduate students. FHI also includes other long-standing "signature" programs, including the Faculty Book Manuscript Workshops. The Annual Lecture and Short-term Residencies bring world-renowned scholars to Duke for public engagements with the university community. The Faculty Bookwatch series, presented in conjunction with the Duke University Libraries, highlights notable recent books by faculty in the humanities and interpretive social sciences.

The FHI's public programs have also included Wednesdays at the Center, a popular lunchtime conversation series open to the general public.  Since 2002, series speakers have included the Harvard historian Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, the [[Ciompi Quartet]] violinist Hsiao-mei Ku, [[Radio France]] Internationale Correspondent Dominique Roch, the writer and human rights activist [[Ariel Dorfman]], as well as John Hope Franklin himself.

The Mellon Annual Distinguished Lecture in Humanities has featured well-known scholars from many fields and from across the globe, including the  philosopher [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]], the British filmmaker [[Isaac Julien]], the Dutch cultural theorist and video artist [[Mieke Bal]], the Indian historian [[Romila Thapar]], and the US literary critic [[Emory Elliott]].

== Technology Initiatives ==
In 2006, Duke joined five other American universities - Brown, Stanford, the University of Michigan, the Missouri School of Journalism, and the University of Wisconsin-Madison - in a venture with Apple Computer to test [[iTunes U]], a web-based tool designed for faculty and students to  share digital content, such as audio, video and images.  As one of the participants on the Duke iTunes U project, the Franklin Humanities Institute has made a number of its public events available for download as video and audio podcasts.

Many of the [http://fhi.duke.edu/labs FHI Humanities Labs] have included substantial digital dimensions in their research outputs as well. These have included collaboratively-produced websites, art installations, mobile applications, online maps, and games.

The '''Gallatin School of Individualized Study''' (commonly known as '''Gallatin''') is a small interdisciplinary college within [[New York University]]. Students design their own interdisciplinary program that meets their specific interests and career goals. Coursework can be taken at any of the schools that comprise NYU in addition to the school's own offerings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thechoice.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/07/degrees-are-getting-a-makeover/?_r=0| title=Creating Your Own Major, From ‘Keeping It Real’ to ‘Grand Romantic Gestures’| author=Lily Altivina| date=February 7, 2012| publisher=The New York Times| access-date=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Founded in 1972 as the '''University Without Walls''', the school was renamed the Gallatin Division in 1976 after [[Albert Gallatin]], [[Secretary of the Treasury]] under [[Thomas Jefferson]], and the founder of NYU. In 1995, the school took its current name, The Gallatin School of Individualized Study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gallatin.nyu.edu/about/facts.html|title=Gallatin Leadership and Facts Page|last=|first=|date=|website=http://gallatin.nyu.edu/|publisher=NYU Gallatin|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert London]] was the school's first dean through 1992. The Gallatin building is situated within the [[Campus of New York University]] just east of [[Washington Square Park]] at 1 Washington Place.

The Gallatin School's facilities on the corner of Washington Place and Broadway underwent a redesign from 2007-2008. It was the first renovation project at NYU to achieve [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certification. The project earned a LEED Gold certification for the renovation of five floors (approximately 32,000 square feet) of the existing building, including the construction of a theater, art gallery, classrooms, studios, and offices.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyu.edu/gallatin/leed/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The main building is named after Georgina Bloomberg.

==Academics==

===Curriculum===

Gallatin students develop a concentration, as opposed to a [[Academic major|major]], that is individualized to suit their interests and goals. A concentration can encompass multiple areas of study and often involves taking courses in various schools within NYU.

Rather than prescribing a specific set of courses (e.g., English 101, Western Civ), Gallatin employs a form of [[student-centered learning]] in which students are free to choose courses they are interested in but are expected to take responsibility for their own academic growth. There are, however, general requirements for graduation. Among these are:

*Gallatin students are required to take 25% of their courses within Gallatin.  Options include writing and arts workshops, [[interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] seminars reaching across the [[liberal arts]], community learning, [[Tutorials#Academia|tutorials]], [[internship]]s, and independent studies.
*Foundation courses, either the Liberal Arts Foundation (8 Humanities credits, 8 Social Science credits, 4 Mathematics or Science credits) or Historical and Cultural Foundation (4 Premodern credits, 4 Early Modern credits, and 4 Global Cultures credits). The two sets of foundation requirements may overlap and fulfill more than one requirement at once.&lt;ref name="nyu"&gt;http://gallatin.nyu.edu/academics/undergraduate/requirements.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*First year requirements: Students take a First-Year Interdisciplinary Seminar, a First-Year Writing Seminar, and a First-Year Research Seminar (numerous topics are available). 
*Second year requirements: The student writes their Intellectual Autobiography and Plan for Concentration (IAPC), an essay which charts their studies thus far and describes the plan for their continuation and refinement.
*Third year requirements: The student writes their Rationale, an essay describing their planned course of study for their final year accompanied by a list of 20-25 books that will be discussed during the Colloquium (see below).  The Rationale is reviewed and approved by two faculty members.
*Fourth year/graduation requirement: The student must successfully pass their Colloquium, an intensive [[oral examination]] during which the student engages with a panel of three faculty for approximately two hours about their concentration and concomitant literature.&lt;ref name="nyu" /&gt;

===Advising===

Because Gallatin focuses on students at the individual level, advising is a major component of the program. Each student is assigned two advisors: a class advisor who serves the needs of a full grade level (freshmen, sophomores, juniors, seniors) and an academic advisor, who is more involved at the individual level with helping students shape their concentrations. The academic advisors help identify the interests of their advisees, approve class schedules, attend advisee Colloquiums, and serve as the primary source of advising. Academic advisors are usually faculty members at Gallatin who share similar interests with advisee students, but advisors can come from any of the schools within NYU across several disciplines. Students can request to change academic advisors.

===Colloquium===

In order to qualify for graduation, all students in the Gallatin undergraduate program must successfully complete a final oral examination called the Colloquium. The Colloquium is an intellectual conversation among four people (the student, the student's adviser, and two other members of the faculty) about a selection of books representing several academic disciplines and historical periods. The Colloquium provides an opportunity for students to reflect on their Gallatin concentration and to synthesize various experiences studying books, taking courses, doing independent studies and internships into an integrated discussion about several books and themes. In preparing for the Colloquium, each student creates a book list of twenty to twenty-five works and writes a brief paper known as the Rationale which describes the themes the student plans to discuss in the Colloquium.

==Student life==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
There are a variety of student-run organizations at Gallatin that span a vast array of interests for both undergraduate and graduate students of the school:

* '''Dancers Choreographers Alliance (DCA)''' provides student choreographers with the opportunity to create their work with fellow student dancers. DCA also allows other members of the performance community to participate in roles such as musicians, composers, and artistic managers.
* '''Gallatin Arts Festival (GAF)''' is a week-long community-wide celebration of the unique artistry and interdisciplinary scholarship of NYU’s Gallatin School. The festival features over 50 students presenting work in the visual and performing arts.
* '''Gallatin Cookies and Coloring''', invites students to eat cookies and color coloring books. The club provides an un-structured forum for students to socialize and relax. Under the current leadership, the club has hosted special events such as body painting and the appreciation of mid-70s feminist coloring books.
* '''Gallatin Theatre Troupe (GTT)''' exists as a collective of students interested in writing, directing, managing, and acting in theatre. GTT serves as a place to discuss theatre and attend shows.
* '''Students of Color &amp; Allies (SOCA)''' serves as a support and networking group that connects students within Gallatin for social outings, intellectual activities, and academic workshops that address common interests. SOCA now organizes events aimed at enhancing the Gallatin experience for students of color.
* '''''The Gallatin Review''''' publishes the poetry, prose, essays, and visual art of students and faculty. 
* '''''The Gallatin Research Journal (GRJ)'''''  is a student-run publication devoted to showcasing the excellence achieved by Gallatin students in the arena of academic non-fiction work. 
* '''''Journal of Global Affairs (JGA)''''' creates, produces, and publishes a scholarly undergraduate journal that showcases articles and artwork pertaining to all aspects of global affairs. JGA provides a forum for undergraduate students at NYU to publish their work in a scholarly journal.
* '''Gallatin Business Club (GBC)''' provides resources, such as seminars, speakers, and group discussion on a variety of business topics. This club is for students interested in the corporate world. The club is an outlet for students to discuss current events in business and provides networking opportunities through speakers in a variety of fields.
* '''NADI: Middle Eastern Studies Society''' endeavors to create an intellectual community for students of the Middle East at Gallatin by means of extra-curricular programming and an annual journal. The organization shares information about Middle Eastern Studies courses, study abroad programs and internships.
* '''Gallatin Math and Science Society''' allows students to advise each other on studying math and science within the Gallatin's requirements. G-MASS is also works to integrate science-based events into the Gallatin calendar.

In physics, '''geometrothermodynamics (GTD)''' is a formalism developed in 2007 by Hernando Quevedo to describe the properties of [[thermodynamic]] systems in terms of concepts of differential geometry.&lt;ref name=quev07&gt;{{cite journal|last=Quevedo | first=Hernando|year=2007|title=Geometrothermodynamics|journal=J. Math. Phys.|volume=48|pages=013506|arxiv=physics/0604164 |bibcode=2007JMP....48a3506Q|doi=10.1063/1.2409524}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Consider a  thermodynamic system in the framework of classical equilibrium thermodynamics. The states of thermodynamic equilibrium are considered as points of an abstract equilibrium space in which a Riemannian metric can be introduced in several ways. In particular, one can introduce [[Hessian matrix|Hessian]] metrics like the [[Fisher information metric]], the [[Weinhold metric]], the [[Ruppeiner metric]] and others, whose components are calculated as the Hessian of a particular [[thermodynamic potential]]. 

Another possibility is to introduce metrics which are independent of the thermodynamic potential, a property which is shared by all thermodynamic systems in classical thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Callen|first=Herbert B.| title=Thermodynamics and an Introduction to Thermostatistics
|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.|year=1985 | isbn=0-471-86256-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a change of thermodynamic potential is equivalent to a [[Legendre transformation]], and Legendre transformations do not act in the equilibrium space, it is necessary to introduce an auxiliary space to correctly handle the Legendre transformations. This is the so-called thermodynamic phase space. If the phase space is equipped with a Legendre invariant Riemannian metric, a smooth map can be introduced that induces a thermodynamic metric in the equilibrium manifold. The thermodynamic metric can then be used with different thermodynamic potentials without changing the geometric properties of the equilibrium manifold.  One expects the geometric properties of the equilibrium manifold to be related to the macroscopic physical properties. 

The details of this relation can be summarized in three main points:
#Curvature is a measure of the thermodynamical interaction.
#Curvature singularities correspond to curvature phase transitions. 
#Thermodynamic geodesics correspond to quasi-static processes.

==Geometric aspects==
{{complex|section|date=June 2018}}

The main ingredient of GTD is a (2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional manifold &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt; 
with coordinates &lt;math&gt;Z^A=\{\Phi,E^a,I^a\}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary thermodynamic potential, &lt;math&gt;E^a&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;a=1,2,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;, are the
extensive variables, and &lt;math&gt;I^a&lt;/math&gt; the intensive variables. It is also
possible to introduce in a canonical manner the fundamental
one-form &lt;math&gt;\Theta = d\Phi - \delta_{ab}I^a d E^b&lt;/math&gt; (summation over repeated indices) with &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ab}={\rm
diag}(+1,\ldots,+1)&lt;/math&gt;, which satisfies the condition &lt;math&gt;\Theta \wedge
(d\Theta)^n \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of thermodynamic
degrees of freedom of the system, and is invariant with respect to
Legendre transformations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Arnold|first=V.I.
| title=Mathematical Methods of Classical Mechanics 
|publisher=[[Springer Verlag]]|year=1989 | isbn=0-387-96890-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\{Z^A\}\longrightarrow \{\widetilde{Z}^A\}=\{\tilde \Phi, \tilde E ^a, \tilde I ^ a\}\ ,\quad
\Phi = \tilde \Phi - \delta_{kl} \tilde E ^k \tilde I ^l ,\quad
E^i = - \tilde I ^{i}, \quad 
  E^j = \tilde E ^j,\quad   
 I^{i} = \tilde E ^i , \quad 
 I^j = \tilde I ^j \ ,
 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i\cup j&lt;/math&gt; is any disjoint decomposition of the set of indices &lt;math&gt;\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;,
and &lt;math&gt;k,l= 1,\ldots,i&lt;/math&gt;. In particular, for &lt;math&gt;i=\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;i=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt; we obtain
the total Legendre transformation and the identity, respectively.
It is also assumed that in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{T} &lt;/math&gt; 
there exists a metric &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; which is also
invariant with respect to Legendre transformations. The triad
&lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{T},\Theta,G)&lt;/math&gt; defines a Riemannian [[contact manifold]] which is
called the thermodynamic phase space (phase manifold). The space of
thermodynamic equilibrium states (equilibrium manifold)  is an
n-dimensional [[Riemannian submanifold]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}\subset \mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;
induced by a smooth map &lt;math&gt;\varphi:\mathcal{E}\rightarrow\mathcal{T}&lt;/math&gt;,
i.e. &lt;math&gt;\varphi:\{E^a\} \mapsto \{\Phi,E^a,I^a\}&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;\Phi=\Phi(E^a)&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;I^a= I^a(E^a)&lt;/math&gt;,  such that &lt;math&gt; \varphi^*(\Theta)=\varphi^*(d\Phi
- \delta_{ab}I^{a}dE^{b})=0 &lt;/math&gt; holds, where &lt;math&gt;\varphi^*&lt;/math&gt; is the
pullback of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;. The manifold &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is naturally equipped
with the Riemannian metric &lt;math&gt;g=\varphi^*(G)&lt;/math&gt;. The purpose of GTD is
to demonstrate that the geometric properties of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; are
related to the thermodynamic properties of a system with fundamental
thermodynamic equation &lt;math&gt;\Phi=\Phi(E^a)&lt;/math&gt;.
The condition of invariance with respect total Legendre transformations leads to the metrics

: &lt;math&gt;
G^I = (d\Phi- \delta_{ab}I^a d E^b)^2 + \Lambda\, (\xi_{ab} E^a I^b)\left( \delta_{cd} dE^c d I^d\right)\ ,\quad
\delta_{ab}={\rm diag}(1,\ldots,1)
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
G^{II} = (d\Phi- \delta_{ab}I^a d E^b)^2 + \Lambda\, (\xi_{ab} E^a I^b)\left( \eta_{cd} dE^c d I^d\right)\ ,\quad
\eta_{ab}={\rm diag}(-1,1,\ldots,1)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\xi_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant diagonal matrix that can be expressed in terms of &lt;math&gt;\delta_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; and
&lt;math&gt;\eta_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary Legendre invariant function of &lt;math&gt;Z^A&lt;/math&gt;. The metrics &lt;math&gt;G^I&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G^{II}&lt;/math&gt; have been used to describe thermodynamic systems with first and second order phase transitions, respectively. The most general metric which is invariant with respect to partial Legendre transformations is

: &lt;math&gt;
G^{III} = (d\Phi- \delta_{ab}I^a d E^b)^2 + \Lambda\, ( E_a I_a)^{2k+1} \left( dE^a d I^a\right)\ ,
\quad
 E_a= \delta_{ab} E^b \ , 
\quad I_a = \delta_{ab} I^b \ .
&lt;/math&gt;

The components of the corresponding metric for the equilibrium manifold &lt;math&gt; {\mathcal E} &lt;/math&gt; can be computed as

: &lt;math&gt;
g_{ab} = \frac{\partial Z^A}{\partial E^a}\frac{\partial Z^B}{\partial E^b} G_{AB}\ .
&lt;/math&gt;

==Applications==
GTD has been applied to describe laboratory systems like the ideal gas, van der Waals gas, the Ising model, etc., more exotic systems like black holes in different gravity theories,&lt;ref name=qstv11&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quevedo | first1=H.|last2=Sanchez | first2=A. |last3=Taj | first3=S.|last4=Vazquez | first4=A. |year=2011|title=Phase transitions in Geometrothermodynamics|journal=Gen.

[[File:George L Mosse.jpg|thumb|George Mosse at Pembroke College, Cambridge University, 1991]]
'''George Lachmann Mosse''' (September 20, 1918 – January 22, 1999) was an emigre from [[Nazi Germany]] first to Great Britain and then to the United States who taught history as a professor at the [[University of Iowa]], the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], and the [[Hebrew University]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Pace, [https://www.nytimes.com/1999/01/31/world/george-l-mosse-dies-at-80-authority-on-nazi-germany.html?module=ArrowsNav&amp;contentCollection=World&amp;action=keypress&amp;region=FixedLeft&amp;pgtype=article obituary], ''New York Times'', 31 January 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Best known for his studies of [[Nazism]], he authored more than 25 books on topics as diverse as constitutional history, [[Protestant theology]], and the history of [[masculinity]]. In 1966, he and [[Walter Laqueur]] founded ''[[The Journal of Contemporary History]]'', which they co-edited.

==Biography==
Mosse was born in [[Berlin]] to a prominent, well-to-do [[German Jewish]] family. His maternal grandfather, [[Rudolf Mosse]], founded what became Germany's largest advertising agency, and his media empire included the respected liberal newspaper ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]''. His father, [[Hans Lachmann-Mosse]], commissioned the architect [[Erich Mendelsohn]] to redesign the iconic [[Mossehaus]] where the ''Tageblatt'' was published. In his autobiography, George Mosse described himself as a mischievous child given to pranks. He was educated at the noted [[Mommsen-Gymnasium]] in Berlin and from 1928 onwards at [[Schule Schloss Salem]], a famously spartan boarding school that exposed the scions of rich and powerful families to a life devoid of privilege. The headmaster at Salem, [[Kurt Hahn]], was an advocate of [[experiential education]] and required all pupils to engage in physically challenging outdoor activities. Although Mosse disliked the school's nationalistic ethos, he conceded that its emphasis on character building and leadership gave him "some backbone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Confronting History – A Memoir |location=Madison |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |year=2000 |page=69 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He preferred individual sports, such as skiing, to team activities.

In 1933, with Hitler's rise to power, the Mosse family emigrated and separated. His mother, Felicia (1888-1972), and his sister, [[Hilde Mosse|Hilde]] (1912-1982), relocated to Switzerland, while his father moved to France, where in 1939 he got a divorce, married Karola Strauch (the mother of Harvard physicist Karl Strauch), and subsequently emigrated to California.  George Mosse moved to England, where he enrolled at the [[Quakers|Quaker]] [[Bootham School]] in [[York]].  It was here, according to his autobiography, that he first became aware of his homosexuality. A struggling student, he failed several exams, but with the financial support of his parents he was admitted to study history at [[Downing College, Cambridge]], in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;''Confronting History'', p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Here he first developed an interest in historical scholarship, attending lectures by [[G. M. Trevelyan]] and [[Helen Cam|Helen Maude Cam]]. While he was at Cambridge, his hostility to [[fascism]] was deepened by the [[Spanish Civil War]] (although he later averred that he had only a superficial understanding of the conflict).

In 1939, his family relocated to the United States, and he continued his undergraduate studies at the Quaker [[Haverford College]], earning a B.A. in 1941. He went on to graduate studies at [[Harvard University]], where he benefited from a scholarship reserved for students born in [[Berlin-Charlottenburg]]. His 1946 Ph.D. dissertation on English constitutional history of the 16th and 17th centuries, supervised by [[Charles Howard McIlwain]], was subsequently published as ''The Struggle for Sovereignty in England'' (1950).

Mosse's first academic appointment as an historian was at the [[University of Iowa]], where he focused on religion in early modern Europe and published a concise study of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] that became a widely used textbook. In 1955, he moved to the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] and began to lecture on modern history. His ''The Culture of Western Europe: The Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries, an Introduction'' (1961), which summarizes these lectures, was also widely adopted as a textbook.

Mosse taught for more than thirty years at the University of Wisconsin, where he was named a John C. Bascom Professor of European History and a Weinstein-Bascom Professor of Jewish Studies, while concurrently holding the Koebner Professorship of History at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. Beginning in 1969, Mosse spent one semester each year teaching at the Hebrew University. He also held appointments as a visiting professor at the [[University of Tel Aviv]] and the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]]. After retiring from the University of Wisconsin, he taught at Cambridge University and [[Cornell University]]. He was named the first research historian in residence at the [[U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum]].

==Scholarship==
Mosse's first published work was a 1947 paper in the ''[[Economic History Review]]'' describing the [[Anti-Corn Law League]]. He claimed that this was the first time the landed gentry had tried to organize a mass movement in order to counter their opponents. In ''The Holy Pretence'' (1957), he suggested that a thin line divides truth and falsehood in [[Puritan casuistry]]. Mosse declared that he approached history not as narrative, but as a series of questions and possible answers. The narrative provides the framework within which the problem of interest can be addressed. A constant theme in his work is the fate of [[liberalism]]. Critics pointed out that he had made [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] [[Sir Edward Coke]], the chief character of his book ''The Struggle for Sovereignty in England'' (1950), into a liberal long before liberalism had come into existence. Reviewers noted that the sub-text in his ''The Culture of Western Europe'' (1961) was the triumph of [[totalitarianism]] over liberalism.

His most well-known book, ''The Crisis of German Ideology: Intellectual Origins of the Third Reich'' (1964), analyses the origins of the nationalist belief system. Mosse claimed, however, that it was not until his book ''The Nationalization of the Masses'' (1975), which dealt with the sacralization of politics, that he began to put his own stamp upon the analysis of cultural history. He started to write it in the [[Jerusalem]] apartment of the historian [[Jacob Talmon]], surrounded by the works of [[Rousseau]]. Mosse sought to draw attention to the role played by myth, symbol, and political liturgy in the [[French Revolution]]. Rousseau, he noted, went from believing that "the people" could govern themselves in town meetings, to urging that the government of Poland invent public ceremonies and festivals in order to imbue the people with allegiance to the nation. Mosse argued that there was a continuity between his work on the Reformation and his work on more recent history. He claimed that it was not a big step from Christian belief systems to modern civic religions such as nationalism.

In the ''Crisis of German Ideology'', he traced how the "[[German Revolution]]" became anti-Jewish, and in ''Towards the Final Solution'' (1979) he wrote a general history of [[racism in Europe]]. He argued that although [[racism]] was originally directed towards blacks, it was subsequently applied to Jews. In ''Nationalism and Sexuality: Respectable and Abnormal Sexuality in Modern Europe'' (1985), he claimed that there was a link between male [[eros (concept)|eros]], the [[German youth movement]], and ''[[Völkisch movement|völkisch]]'' thought. Because of the dominance of the male image in so much nationalism, he decided to write the history of that stereotype in ''The Image of Man: The Creation of Modern Masculinity'' (1996).

Mosse saw nationalism, which often includes racism, as the chief menace of modern times. As a Jew, he regarded the rejection of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in Europe as a personal threat, as it was the Enlightenment spirit which had liberated the Jews. He noted that European nationalism had initially tried to combine patriotism, human rights, cosmopolitanism, and tolerance. It was only later that France and then Germany came to believe that they had a monopoly on virtue. In developing this view Mosse was influenced by [[Peter Viereck]], who argued that the turn towards aggressive nationalism first arose in the era of [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Ernst Moritz Arndt]]. Mosse traced the origins of Nazism in ''völkisch'' ideology back to a 19th-century organicist worldview that fused pseudo-scientific nature philosophy with mystical notions of German soul. The Nazis made ''völkisch'' thinking accessible to the broader public via potent rhetoric, powerful symbols, and mass rituals. Mosse demonstrated that [[antisemitism]] drew on stereotypes that depicted the Jew as the enemy of the German ''[[Volk]]''; an embodiment of the urban, materialistic, scientific culture that was supposedly responsible for the corruption of the German spirit.

In ''Toward the Final Solution'', he claimed that racial stereotypes were rooted in the European tendency to classify human beings according to their closeness or distance from Greek ideals of beauty. ''Nationalism and Sexuality: Middle-Class Morality and Sexual Norms in Modern Europe'' extended these insight to encompass other excluded or persecuted groups: Jews, homosexuals, [[Romani people]], and the mentally ill. Many 19th-century thinkers relied upon binary stereotypes that categorized human beings either as "healthy" or "degenerate", "normal" or "abnormal", "insiders" or "outsiders". In ''The Image of Man: The Creation of Modern Masculinity'', Mosse argued that middle-class male respectability evoked "counter-type" images of men whose weakness, nervousness, and effeminacy threatened to undermine an ideal of manhood.

Mosse's upbringing attuned him to both the advantages and the dangers of a humanistic education. His book ''German Jews Beyond Judaism'' (1985) describes how the German-Jewish dedication to ''Bildung'', or cultivation, helped Jews to transcend their group identity. But it also argues that during the [[Weimar Republic]], ''Bildung'' contributed to a blindness toward the illiberal political realities that later engulfed Jewish families. Mosse's liberalism also informed his supportive but critical stance toward [[Zionism]] and the [[State of Israel]]. In an essay written on the occasion of the 100th anniversary of Zionism, he wrote that the early Zionists envisioned a liberal commonwealth based on individualism and solidarity, but a "more aggressive, exclusionary and normative nationalism eventually came to the fore."

Historian James Franklin argues that:
: as a teacher and scholar, George Mosse has posed challenging questions about what it means to be an intellectual engaged in the world. The central problem Mosse has examined throughout his career is: how do intellectuals relate their ideas to reality or to alternative views of that reality?.... Mosse has chosen to focus on intellectuals and the movements with which they were often connected at their most intemperate.... For Mosse, the role of the historian is one of political engagement; he or she must delineate the connections (and disconnections) between myth and reality.&lt;ref&gt;James E. Franklin, "Mosse, George L." in Kelly Boyd, ed., ''Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writers'' (1999) 2:841.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction as a teacher==
At the University of Wisconsin, George Mosse was recognized as a charismatic and inspiring teacher. Tom Bates' ''Rads: A True Story of the End of the Sixties'' (1992) describes how students flocked to Mosse's courses to "savor the crossfire" with his friend and rival, the [[Marxist]] historian [[Harvey Goldberg]]. Mosse charmed his students by mingling critical skepticism with humor, irony, and empathy; but they also admired the way he applied his historical knowledge to contemporary issues, attempting to be fair to opposing views while remaining true to his own principles.

==Legacy==
Mosse left a substantial bequest to the University of Wisconsin–Madison to establish the George L. Mosse Program in History, a collaborative program with the [[Hebrew University]] in Jerusalem. He also left modest endowments to support [[Queer studies|LGBT studies]] at both the University of Wisconsin–Madison and the [[University of Amsterdam]], where he taught as a visiting professor.  These endowments were funded by the restitution of the Mosse family's properties expropriated by the Nazi regime that were not restored until 1989-90, following the collapse of [[East Germany]].

'''Global change''' refers to planetary-scale changes in the [[Earth]] system. The system consists of the [[Terrestrial ecoregion|land]], [[oceans]], [[atmosphere]], [[polar region]]s, [[life]], the planet's natural cycles and deep Earth processes. These constituent parts influence one another. The Earth system now includes [[human society]], so global change also refers to large-scale changes in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |title=International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme the Earth as a System |accessdate=2010-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429213905/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=101 |archivedate=2010-04-29 |df= }} [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]]&lt;/ref&gt;

More completely, the term "global change" encompasses: [[population]], [[climate]], the [[economy]], resource use, [[energy development]], [[transport]], [[communication]], [[land use]] and [[land cover]], [[urbanization]], [[globalization]], [[atmospheric circulation]], [[ocean circulation]], the [[carbon cycle]], the [[nitrogen cycle]], the [[water cycle]] and other cycles, [[sea ice]] loss, [[sea-level rise]], [[food webs]], [[biological diversity]], [[pollution]], [[health]], [[over fishing]], and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Research/TNT/WEB/Publications/Abrupt_Changes/Abrupt_Changes.pdf|title=The Achilles Heel of the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher   = [[International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of global-change research ==

In 1980, a group of scientists led by Swedish meteorologist [[Bert Bolin]] set up an international program called the [[World Climate Research Programme]] (WCRP), to determine whether the climate was changing, whether climate could be predicted and whether humans were in some way responsible for the change. The programme was sponsored by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] and the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU). As time went on, there was a growing realisation that climate change was one part of a larger phenomenon, global change. In 1987, a team of researchers, led again by Bert Bolin, James McCarthy, [[Paul Crutzen]], H. Oeschger and others,  successfully argued for an international research programme to investigate global change. This programme, sponsored by ICSU, is the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]] (IGBP). The programme has eight projects investigating different parts of the Earth system and links between them.

IGBP, WCRP and a third programme, the [[International Human Dimensions Programme]] (IHDP, founded in 1996), spearheaded a landmark science conference held in Amsterdam in 2001. The conference, ''Challenges of a Changing Earth: Global Change Open Science Conference'', led to the Amsterdam Declaration which stated, "In addition to the threat of significant climate change, there is growing concern over the ever-increasing human modification of other aspects of the global environment and the consequent implications for human well-being. Basic goods and services supplied by the planetary life support system, such as food, water, clean air and an environment conducive to human health, are being affected increasingly by global change."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essp.org/index.php?id=41|title=The Amsterdam Declaration|accessdate=2010-03-25|publisher=[[Earth System Science Partnership]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The declaration goes on to say, "The international global change programmes urge governments, public and private institutions and people of the world to agree that an ethical framework for global stewardship and strategies for Earth System management are urgently needed."&lt;ref name="The Amsterdam Declaration"/&gt;

Many nations now have their own global change programmes and institutes, for example the US Global Change Research Program and the UK's Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System (QUEST) programme. And since the Amsterdam conference another international programme focusing on biodiversity has been set up, [[Diversitas|DIVERSITAS]]. These programmes form the Earth System Science Partnership.

In 2012, these international programmes held another major science conference in London, Planet Under Pressure: new knowledge towards solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url=https://erc.europa.eu/event/planet-under-pressure-new-knowledge-towards-solutions | title=Planet Under Pressure: New Knowledge Towards Solutions | date=2012 | publisher=European Research Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

In the past, the main drivers of global change have been [[solar variation]], [[plate tectonics]], [[volcanism]], proliferation and abatement of [[life]], [[meteorite]] impact, resource depletion, changes in [[Earth]]'s orbit around the sun and changes in the tilt of Earth on its axis. There is overwhelming evidence that now the main driver of planetary-scale change, or global change, is  the growing human population's [[energy demand|demand for energy]], food, goods, services and information, and its [[waste disposal|disposal]] of its [[waste]] products.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In the last 250 years, global change has caused [[climate change]], [[Holocene extinction|widespread species extinction]]s, fish-stock collapse, [[desertification]], [[ocean acidification]], [[ozone depletion]], [[pollution]], and other large-scale shifts.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Scientists working on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme have said that Earth is now operating in a "no analogue" state.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|title=Global Change and the Earth System|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100429214445/http://www.igbp.net/page.php?pid=230|archivedate=2010-04-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurements of Earth system processes, past and present, have led to the conclusion that the planet has moved well outside the range of natural variability in the last half million years at least. ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' have been around for about 200,000 years.

What this means for the planet and society remains unclear. But, in the last 20 years there has been an enormous international research effort to understand global change and the Earth system. An aim of this research is to work out if there are planetary boundaries and are we approaching them. Scientists, international governmental organizations and lobbying organizations like [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] argue that current consumption levels, particularly in developed countries, are not sustainable because there is a very real danger they will push the planet into a new state. What this new state might look like is still being debated, but sea levels are likely to rise several meters, the [[pH]] of the oceans, a measure of its acidity, is likely to drop farther than it has in 20 million years, and global atmospheric and ocean circulations may shift markedly. The major cycles – [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], [[sulfur]], [[phosphorus]], [[water]] – and other important parameters would alter, bringing [[drought]] to some places, floods to others. Governments will no longer be able to take for granted the relative environmental stability that has allowed human society to flourish and led to rapid globalization. Most of the population of the planet will be affected. The [[re-insurance]] industry is already taking measures to protect its interests and maximize profits as turbulent times approach.

== Physical evidence ==

{{Refimprove|date=January 2017}}

Humans have always altered their environment. The advent of agriculture around 10000 years ago led to a radical change in land use that still continues. But, the relatively small human population had little impact on a global scale until the start of the [[industrial revolution]] in 1750. This event, followed by the invention of the [[Haber-Bosch]] process in 1909, which allowed large-scale manufacture of [[fertilizers]], led directly to rapid changes to many of the planet's most important physical, chemical and biological processes.

The 1950s marked a shift in gear: global change began accelerating. Between 1950 and 2010, the population more than doubled. In that time, rapid expansion of international trade coupled with upsurges in capital flows and new technologies, particularly information and communication technologies, led to national economies becoming more fully integrated. There was a tenfold increase in economic activity and the world's [[human population]] became more tightly connected than ever before. The period saw sixfold increases in water use and river damming. About 70 percent of the world's [[freshwater]] resource is now used for agriculture. This rises to 90 percent in India and China. Half of the Earth's land surface had now been domesticated. By 2010, urban population, for the first time, exceeded rural population. And there has been a fivefold increase in fertilizer use. Indeed, manufactured reactive nitrogen from fertilizer production and industry now exceeds global terrestrial production of reactive nitrogen. Without artificial fertilizers there would not be enough food to sustain a population of seven billion people.

These changes to the human sub-system have a direct influence on all components of the Earth system. The chemical composition of the atmosphere has changed significantly. Concentrations of important [[greenhouse gases]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[methane]] and [[nitrous oxide]] are rising fast. Over [[Antarctica]] a large hole in the ozone layer appeared. Fisheries collapsed: most of the world's fisheries are now fully or over-exploited. Thirty percent of tropical [[rainforests]] disappeared.

In 2000, Nobel prize-winning scientist [[Paul Crutzen]] announced the scale of change is so great that in just 250 years, human society has pushed the planet into a new geological era: the [[Anthropocene]]. This name has stuck and there are calls for the Anthropocene to be adopted officially. If it is, it may be the shortest of all geological eras. Evidence suggests that if human activities continue to change components of the Earth system, which are all interlinked, this could heave the Earth system out of a one state and into a new state.

== Society ==
Global change in a societal context encompasses social, cultural, technological, political, economic and legal change.  Terms closely related to global change and society are [[globalization]] and global integration. Globalization began with long-distance trade and urbanism. The first record of long distance trading routes is in the third millennium BC. Sumerians in [[Mesopotamia]] traded with settlers in the [[Indus Valley]], in modern-day India.

Since 1750, but more significantly, since the 1950s, global integration has accelerated. This era has witnessed incredible global changes in communications, transportation, and computer technology. Ideas, [[cultures]], people, goods, services and money move around the planet with ease. This new global interconnectedness and free flow of information has radically altered notions of other cultures, [[Group conflict|conflicts]], [[religions]] and [[taboos]]. Now, social movements can and do form at a planetary scale.

Evidence, if more were needed, of the link between social and environmental global change came with the 2008-2009 global [[financial crisis]]. The crisis pushed the planet's main economic powerhouses, the [[United States]], [[Europe]] and much of [[Asia]] into recession. According to the [[Global Carbon Project]], global atmospheric emissions of carbon dioxide fell from an annual growth rate of around 3.4% between 2000 and 2008, to a growth rate of about 2% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|title=2008 Global Carbon Budget|publisher=[[Global Carbon Project]]|accessdate=2010-03-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706160635/http://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/08/hl-full.htm|archivedate=2010-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Planetary management ==
{{main|Planetary management}}

Humans are altering the planet's [[biogeochemical cycle]]s in a largely unregulated way with limited knowledge of the consequences.&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; Without steps to effectively manage the Earth system – the planet's physical, chemical, biological and social components – it is likely there will be severe impacts on people and ecosystems. Perhaps the largest concern is that a component of the Earth system, for example, an [[ocean circulation]], the [[Amazon rainforest]], or [[Arctic]] sea ice, will reach a tipping point and flip from its current state to another state: flowing to not flowing, rainforest to [[savanna]], or ice to no ice. A domino effect could ensue with other components of the Earth system changing state rapidly.

Intensive research over the last 20 years has shown that tipping points do exist in the Earth system, and wide-scale change can be rapid – a matter of decades. Potential tipping points have been identified and attempts have been made to quantify thresholds. But to date, the best efforts can only identify loosely defined "[[planetary boundaries]]" beyond which tipping points exist but their precise locations remain elusive.

There have been calls for a better way to manage the environment on a planetary scale, sometimes referred to as managing "Earth's life support system". The [[United Nations]] was formed to stop wars and provide a platform for dialogue between countries. It was not created to avoid major environmental catastrophe on regional or global scales. But several international environmental conventions exist under the UN, including the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|Framework Convention on Climate Change]], [[Montreal Protocol]], [[United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification|Convention to Combat Desertification]], and [[Convention on Biological Diversity]]. Additionally, the UN has two bodies charged with coordinating environmental and development activities, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).

In 2004, the IGBP published "Global Change and the Earth System, a planet under pressure."&lt;ref name="Global Change and the Earth System"/&gt; The publication's executive summary concluded: "An overall, comprehensive, internally consistent strategy for stewardship of the Earth system is required". It stated that a research goal is to define and maintain a stable equilibrium in the global environment.

In 2007, France called for UNEP to be replaced by a new and more powerful organization called the "[[United Nations Environment Organization]]". The rationale was that UNEP's status as a "programme", rather than an "organization" in the tradition of the [[World Health Organization]] or the [[World Meteorological Organization]], weakened it to the extent that it was no longer fit for purpose given current knowledge of the state of the planet.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

'''Government Physical Education College, Dhaka''' ({{lang-bn|সরকারী শারীরিক শিক্ষা কলেজ, ঢাকা|translit=Shorkari Sharirik Shikkha College, Dhaka}}) is a physical education college in Bangladesh which is committed to provide students a chance to study how to keep themselves healthy with lifelong skills.

==History==
The first physical education college was established in 1954 in Gouripur Rajbari of not far off [[Mymensingh]] district in [[Bangladesh]].&lt;ref&gt;Hossain, Md Jakir (2006). ''The Education System of Bangladesh'', p. 260. Dhaka Central Public Library, Dhaka.&lt;/ref&gt; After that in 1955 the college was settled in Armanitola in [[Dhaka]] and then it shifted at Darfin hostel of Narinda and Aliya Madrassa. At last finally in 1962 the college was moved permanently at [[Mohammadpur Thana|Mohammadpur]] in Dhaka as the first Government Physical Education College in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;Kabir, Md Billal (1999). ''The History of Govt.Physical Education College, Dhaka'', p. 87.  Library of Govt.Physical Education College, Dhaka.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
The Government Physical Education College is a full residential academic institute. It is situated in 7.90 acre land area. There are two student hostels (one for male and another for females), a staff residential building, an administrative building, a college building,a 400-meter running track, a swimming pool, a basketball ground, and a gymnasium at the college. All indoor, outdoor games facilities are available at the college campus. Now The Government Physical Education College is only providing the Bachelor of Physical Education (BP.Ed) Degree.

Government Physical Education College, Dhaka is under [[Bangladesh National University|National University]] of Bangladesh. All educational and teaching activities are conducted in English at the college.

==Recent activities==
58th Batch is completing there course. Total Students are 208.

The '''ITER Neutral Beam Test Facility''' is a part of the [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]] (ITER) in [[Padova]], [[Veneto]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.euro-fusion.org/newsletter/iter-neutral-beam-test-facility-construction-is-progressing-fast-in-padova/&lt;/ref&gt; The facility is being built to host the full-scale prototype of the reactor's neutral beam injector, MITICA, and a smaller prototype of its ion source, SPIDER.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stacks.iop.org/0029-5515/55/i=8/a=083025 V. Toigo, D. Boilson, T. Bonicelli, R. Piovan, M. Hanada, et al. 2015 Nucl. Fusion 55:8 083025]&lt;/ref&gt; SPIDER is planned to start its operation in December 2017. SPIDER will be used to optimize the ion beam source, to optimize the use of cesium vapor, and to verify the uniformity of the extracted ion beam also during long pulses.

== ITER Heating Neutral Beams ==

To deliver power, two heating [[Neutral Beam Injection|neutral beam injectors]] provide the power of 17MW each to a four-meter diameter container containing burning fusion plasma. This is the main auxiliary heating system of the reactor. &lt;!-- To reach the container center, an about 1MeV deuterium beam having is required.  why is this important here? --&gt;Due to its low conversion efficiency, the neutral beam injector first needs to start a precursor negative ion beam of 40A, and then neutralizes it by passing it through a gas cell (&lt;60%), and then by a residual ion dump (the remaining 40% — 20% negative, 20% positive). The neutralized beam is then dumped on a [[calorimeter]] during conditioning phases, or coupled with the plasma. Further reionization losses or interception with the mechanical components reduce its current to 17A.&lt;ref&gt;LR Grisham, P Agostinetti, G Barrera, P Blatchford, D Boilson, J Chareyre, et al., Recent improvements to the ITER neutral beam system design, Fusion Engineering and Design 87 (11), 1805-1815&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
Heating and Current Drive [[Neutral Beam Injector]]
==The ITER Heating Neutral Beams==
The ITER Heating and Current Drive [[Neutral Beam Injector]]&lt;ref&gt;LR Grisham, P Agostinetti, G Barrera, P Blatchford, D Boilson, J Chareyre, et al., Recent improvements to the ITER neutral beam system design, Fusion Engineering and Design 87 (11), 1805-1815&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the main auxiliary heating system of the [[ITER]] plasma: each of the two Heating Neutral Beam (HNB) injectors will provide 17MW to the fusion plasma. In order to reach the center of the burning plasma with radius of 2 meters, a

deuterium beam having energy of around 1MeV is required. Due to the low conversion efficiency of NBI systems, to provide the required power to the plasma a precursor negative ion beam of 40A is necessary. The ion beam crosses a gas cell where it is partially neutralized (&lt;60%) with the remaining ions (20% negative, 20% positive ions) removed by the next component of the beam line, the so called residual ion dump. The neutral beam is then dumped on a calorimeter during conditioning phases, or coupled with the plasma. Further re-ionization losses or interception with the mechanical components reduce its current to 17A.--&gt;

== Purposes ==

The role of the test facility includes research and development on the following topics:
* voltage holding: due to neutron environment, this will be the first beam source at -1MV with vacuum insulation instead of gas insulation (SF_6 gas is typically used);
* negative ion formation: the requirement on the extracted current density from the cesiated ion source is at the limit of the present technology of plasma ion sources. 
* beam optics: the precursor ion beam is generated in a multigrid electrostatic accelerator, having 1280 apertures in each of the 7 grids composing it. Since the overall width of the beam along the beam drift (about 25 meters) is due to the optics of each of the 1280 beamlets, the grid alignment and the disturbances produced by magnetic fields and electrostatic error fields are to be carefully verified.
* vacuum pumps: two 8m long, 1.6m high cryopumps will be installed on each side of the vacuum vessel. The fatigue life of components operating with cycles between 4K and 400K is to be verified.
* heat load on mechanical components: on the electrodes used for beam acceleration, and along the beam path, mechanical components are subject to very high thermal loads. These loads are continuously applied during long pulses, up to 1h. These loads are anyhow lower than the heat loads expected on the ITER divertor plates.

'''Innovation''' can be simply defined as a "new idea, creative thoughts, new imaginations in form of device or method".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/innovation |title= Innovation  |publisher= Merriam-Webster |website= Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate= 2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better [[problem solving | solutions]] that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing[[market (economics) | market]] needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Maranville, S.|title=Entrepreneurship in the Business Curriculum|journal=Journal of Education for Business|volume=68|pages=27–31|doi=10.1080/08832323.1992.10117582|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such innovation takes place through the provision of more-effective [[product (business)|product]]s, [[Procedure (term)|processes]], [[Service (economics)|service]]s, [[technologies]], or [[business model]]s that are made available to [[Market (economics)|market]]s, [[government]]s and [[society]]. The term "innovation" can be defined{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that "breaks into" the market or society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.hitech.2009.02.002|title=Questioning two myths in innovation literature|journal=The Journal of High Technology Management Research|volume=20|pages=40–51|year=2009|last1=Frankelius|first1=Per}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innovations tend to be produced by outsiders and [[Founder CEO|founders]] in [[startups]], rather than existing organizations. Innovation is related to, but not the same as, [[invention]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-the-difference-between-invention-and-innovation-2012-4 | title = This Is The Difference Between 'Invention' And 'Innovation' | first = Kim | last = Bhasin | date = 2012-04-02 | work = Business Insider }}&lt;/ref&gt; as innovation is more apt to involve the practical implementation of an invention (i.e. new/improved ability) to make a meaningful impact in the market or society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/09/10/whats-the-difference-between-invention-and-innovation/ | title=What's the Difference Between Invention and Innovation?|publisher=Forbes|date=2015-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not all innovations require an invention. Innovation often{{quantify|date=April 2018}} manifests itself via the [[engineering]] process, when the problem being solved is of a technical or scientific nature. The opposite of innovation is [[exnovation]].

Pronunciation of the word has long been argued about due to the unusual sounding of the o becoming an i. The phonetic sound would suggest a spelling of inivative if taken at the word of a true scholar. 

While a novel device is often described{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} as an innovation, in economics, [[management science]], and other fields of practice and analysis, innovation is generally considered to be the result of a process that brings together various novel ideas in such a way that they affect society. In [[industrial economics]], innovations are created and found{{by whom?|date=April 2018}} empirically from services to meet growing [[consumer]] [[demand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/general/34749412.pdf Growth in Services].

==Definition==
A 2014 survey of literature on innovation found over 40 definitions. In an industrial survey of how the [[software industry]] defined innovation, the following definition given by Crossan and Apaydin was considered to be the most complete, which  builds on the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)]] manual's definition:&lt;ref name="Henry2014"&gt;Edison, H.,  Ali, N.B., &amp; Torkar, R. (2014). [http://www.torkar.se/resources/jss-edisonNT13.pdf Towards innovation measurement in the software industry]. ''Journal of Systems and Software'' 86(5), 1390–407.&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Innovation is production or adoption, assimilation, and exploitation of a value-added novelty in economic and social spheres; renewal and enlargement of products, services, and markets; development of new methods of production; and the establishment of new management systems. It is both a process and an outcome.}}

According to Kanter innovation includes original invention and creative use and defines innovation as a generation, admission and realization of new ideas, products, services and processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Innovation in American Government: Challenges, Opportunities, and Dilemmas|last=|first=|publisher=Brookings Inst Pr|isbn=9780815703587|location=|pages=|date=1997-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two main dimensions of innovation were degree of [[novelty (patent)]] (i.e. whether an innovation is new to the firm, new to the market, new to the industry, or new to the world) and kind of innovation (i.e. whether it is processor [[product-service system]] innovation).&lt;ref name="Henry2014" /&gt; In recent organizational scholarship, researchers of workplaces have also distinguished innovation to be separate from creativity, by providing an updated definition of these two related but distinct constructs:{{quote|Workplace creativity concerns the cognitive and behavioral processes applied when attempting to generate novel ideas. Workplace innovation concerns the processes applied when attempting to implement new ideas. Specifically, innovation involves some combination of problem/opportunity identification, the introduction, adoption or modification of new ideas germane to organizational needs, the promotion of these ideas, and the practical implementation of these ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hughes|first=D.

==Inter-disciplinary views==

===Business and economics===
{{main|innovation economics}}
In [[commerce|business]] and in [[economics]], innovation can become a catalyst for growth. With rapid advancements in [[transportation]] and [[communications]] over the past few decades, the old-world concepts of [[factor endowment]]s and [[comparative advantage]] which focused on an area's unique inputs are outmoded for today's [[globalization|global economy]]. Economist [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (1883–1950), who contributed greatly to the study of [[innovation economics]], argued that industries must incessantly revolutionize the economic structure from within, that is innovate with better or more effective processes and products, as well as market distribution, such as the connection from the craft shop to factory. He famously asserted that "[[creative destruction]] is the essential fact about [[capitalism]]".&lt;ref name=capsocdem&gt;{{cite book | author = Schumpeter, J. A. | authorlink = Joseph Schumpeter | year = 1943 | title = Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy | publisher = Routledge | edition = 6 | pages = 81–84 | isbn = 978-0-415-10762-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Entrepreneur]]s continuously look for better ways to satisfy their [[consumer demand|consumer base]] with improved quality, durability, service and price which come to fruition in innovation with advanced technologies and organizational strategies.&lt;ref&gt;Heyne, P., Boettke, P. J., and Prychitko, D. L. (2010). ''The Economic Way of Thinking''. Prentice Hall, 12th ed. pp. 163, 317–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

A prime example of innovation involved the explosive boom of [[Silicon Valley]] startups out of the [[Stanford Industrial Park]]. In 1957, dissatisfied employees of [[Shockley Semiconductor]], the company of [[Nobel laureate]] and co-inventor of the [[transistor]] [[William Shockley]], left to form an independent firm, [[Fairchild Semiconductor]]. After several years, Fairchild developed into a formidable presence in the sector. Eventually, these founders left to start their own companies based on their own, unique, latest ideas, and then leading employees started their own firms. Over the next 20 years, this snowball process launched the momentous [[startup company|startup-company]] explosion of [[information technology|information-technology]] firms. Essentially, Silicon Valley began as 65 new enterprises born out of Shockley's eight former employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url= http://www.netvalley.com/svhistory.html |title= Silicon Valley History &amp; Future |website= Netvalley.com |date= |accessdate= 2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, hubs of innovation have sprung up globally with similar [[metonym]]s, including [[Silicon Alley]] encompassing [[New York City]].

Another example involves [[business incubator]]s – a phenomenon nurtured by governments around the world, close to knowledge clusters (mostly research-based) like universities or other [[Government Excellence Centre]]s – which aim primarily to channel generated knowledge to applied innovation outcomes in order to stimulate regional or national [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizations===
In the organizational context, innovation may be linked to positive changes in [[efficiency]], [[productivity]], [[Quality (business)|quality]], [[Competition (companies)|competitiveness]], and [[market share]]. However, recent research findings highlight the complementary role of organizational culture in enabling organizations to translate innovative activity into tangible performance improvements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1540-6210.2012.02529.x|title=Benefiting from Public Sector Innovation: The Moderating Role of Customer and Learning Orientation|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=72|issue=4|pages=550–559|year=2012|last1=Salge|first1=Torsten Oliver|last2=Vera|first2=Antonio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organizations can also improve profits and performance by providing work groups opportunities and resources to innovate, in addition to employee's core job tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1464-0597.00951|title=Sparkling Fountains or Stagnant Ponds: An Integrative Model of Creativity and Innovation Implementation in Work Groups|journal=Applied Psychology|volume=51|issue=3|pages=355–387|year=2002|last1=West|first1=Michael A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Drucker]] wrote:
{{quote|Innovation is the specific function of entrepreneurship, whether in an existing business, a public service institution, or a new venture started by a lone individual in the family kitchen. It is the means by which the entrepreneur either creates new wealth-producing resources or endows existing resources with enhanced potential for creating wealth. –Drucker&lt;ref name="Drucker"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Discipline of Innovation |work=[[Harvard Business Review]] |url= http://hbr.org/2002/08/the-discipline-of-innovation/ar/1 |date=August 2002 |access-date=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Clayton Christensen, [[disruptive innovation]] is the key to future success in business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Christensen, Clayton &amp; Overdorf, Michael|year=2000|title=Meeting the Challenge of Disruptive Change|url=https://hbr.org/2000/03/meeting-the-challenge-of-disruptive-change|journal=Harvard Business Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation requires a proper structure in order to retain competitive advantage. It is necessary to create and nurture an environment of innovation. Executives and managers need to break away from traditional ways of thinking and use change to their advantage. It is a time of risk but even greater opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;''MIT Sloan Management Review'' Spring 2002. "How to identify and build New Businesses"&lt;/ref&gt; The world of work is changing with the increase in the use of technology and both companies and businesses are becoming increasingly competitive. Companies will have to downsize and re-engineer their operations to remain competitive. This will affect employment as businesses will be forced to reduce the number of people employed while accomplishing the same amount of work if not more.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, Scott D.; Johnson, Mark W.; Sinfield, Joseph V.; Altman, Elizabeth J. (2008). ''Innovator's Guide to Growth''. "Putting Disruptive Innovation to Work". Harvard Business School Press. {{ISBN|978-1-59139-846-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While disruptive innovation will typically "attack a traditional business model with a lower-cost solution and overtake incumbent firms quickly,"&lt;ref name=hbr201701/&gt; foundational innovation is slower, and typically has the potential to create new foundations for global technology systems over the longer term. Foundational innovation tends to transform business [[operating model]]s as entirely new business models [[emergence|emerge]] over many years, with gradual and steady adoption of the innovation leading to waves of [[technological change|technological]] and [[institution]]al change that gain momentum more slowly.&lt;ref name=hbr201701&gt;

All organizations can innovate, including for example hospitals, universities, and local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19104264|year=2009|last1=Salge|first1=T. O.|title=Hospital innovativeness and organizational performance: Evidence from English public acute care|journal=Health Care Management Review|volume=34|issue=1|pages=54–67|last2=Vera|first2=A.|doi=10.1097/01.HMR.0000342978.84307.80}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, former Mayor [[Martin O’Malley]] pushed the [[City of Baltimore]] to use [[CitiStat]], a [[Performance measurement|performance-measurement]] data and management system that allows city officials to maintain statistics on several areas from crime trends to the conditions of [[pothole]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s. This system aids in better evaluation of policies and procedures with accountability and efficiency in terms of time and money. In its first year, CitiStat saved the city $13.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;Perez, T. and Rushing R. (2007). [https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/general/reports/2007/04/23/2911/the-citistat-model-how-data-driven-government-can-increase-efficiency-and-effectiveness/ "The CitiStat Model: How Data-Driven Government Can Increase Efficiency and Effectiveness"]. ''Center for American Progress Report''. pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Even [[mass transit]] systems have innovated with [[hybrid vehicle|hybrid]] bus fleets to [[Real-time locating system|real-time tracking]] at bus stands. In addition, the growing use of [[mobile data terminal]]s in vehicles, that serve as communication hubs between vehicles and a control center, automatically send data on location, passenger counts, engine performance, mileage and other information. This tool helps to deliver and manage transportation systems.&lt;ref&gt;Transportation Research Board (2007). "Transit Cooperative Research Program (TCRP) Synthesis 70: Mobile Data Terminals". pp. 1–5. [http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/tcrp/tcrp_syn_70.pdf TCRP (PDF)].&lt;/ref&gt;

Still other innovative strategies include [[hospital]]s digitizing medical information in [[electronic medical records]]. For example, the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development]]'s [[HOPE VI]] initiatives turned severely distressed [[public housing]] in urban areas into [[Urban renewal|revitalized]], mixed-income environments; the [[Harlem Children’s Zone]] used a community-based approach to educate local area children; and the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s [[Brownfield regulation and development|brownfield grants]] facilitates turning over [[brownfield]]s for [[environmental protection]], [[Open space reserve|green spaces]], [[Community development|community]] and [[Commerce|commercial development]].

===Sources ===
There are several sources of innovation. It can occur as a result of a focus effort by a range of different agents, by chance, or as a result of a major system failure.

According to [[Peter F. Drucker]], the general sources of innovations are different changes in industry structure, in market structure, in local and global demographics, in human perception, mood and meaning, in the amount of already available scientific knowledge, etc.&lt;ref name=Drucker/&gt;

[[File:Technological Change.jpg|thumb|Original model of three phases of the process of Technological Change]]
In the simplest [[linear model of innovation]] the traditionally recognized source is ''manufacturer innovation''. This is where an agent (person or business) innovates in order to sell the innovation. Specifically, R&amp;D measurement is the commonly used input for innovation, in particular in the business sector, named Business Expenditure on R&amp;D (BERD) that grew over the years on the expenses of the declining R&amp;D invested by the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=H. Rubin|first=Tzameret|year=2015|title=The Achilles heel of a strong private knowledge sector: evidence from Israel|url=http://nimbusvault.net/publications/koala/inimpact/papers/inkt14-011.pdf|journal=The Journal of Innovation Impact|volume=7 |issue=1|pages=80–99|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another source of innovation, only now becoming widely recognized, is ''end-user innovation''. This is where an agent (person or company) develops an innovation for their own (personal or in-house) use because existing products do not meet their needs. [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] economist [[Eric von Hippel]] has identified end-user innovation as, by far, the most important and critical in his classic book on the subject, ''The Sources of Innovation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/books/sources/SofI.pdf |title=The Sources of Innovation |last=Von Hippel |first=Eric |authorlink=Eric von Hippel |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1988 |dead-url=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012160410/http://web.mit.edu/evhippel/www/books/sources/SofI.pdf |archivedate=12 October 2006 |accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The robotics engineer [[Joseph F. Engelberger]] asserts that innovations require only three things:
# A recognized need,
# Competent people with relevant technology, and
# Financial support.&lt;ref&gt;Engelberger, J. F. (1982). "Robotics in practice: Future capabilities". ''Electronic Servicing &amp; Technology'' magazine.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, innovation processes usually involve: identifying customer needs, macro and meso trends, developing competences, and finding financial support.

The Kline [[chain-linked model]] of innovation&lt;ref&gt;Kline (1985). ''Research, Invention, Innovation and Production: Models and Reality, Report INN-1'', March 1985, Mechanical Engineering Department, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; places emphasis on potential market needs as drivers of the innovation process, and describes the complex and often iterative feedback loops between marketing, design, manufacturing, and R&amp;D.

Innovation by businesses is achieved in many ways, with much attention now given to formal [[research and development]] (R&amp;D) for "breakthrough innovations". R&amp;D help spur on patents and other scientific innovations that leads to productive growth in such areas as industry, medicine, engineering, and government.&lt;ref name="MetroPolicy"&gt;Mark, M., Katz, B., Rahman, S., and Warren, D. (2008) [https://www.brookings.edu/research/metropolicy-shaping-a-new-federal-partnership-for-a-metropolitan-nation/ ''MetroPolicy: Shaping A New Federal Partnership for a Metropolitan Nation'']. Brookings Institution: Metropolitan Policy Program Report. pp. 4–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, innovations can be developed by less formal on-the-job modifications of practice, through exchange and combination of professional experience and by many other routes. Investigation of relationship between the concepts of innovation and technology transfer revealed overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286542154 |title=Perspectives on Innovation and Technology Transfer |last=Dubickis, M. |first=Gaile-Sarkane, E. |publisher=[[ScienceDirect]] |year=2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more radical and revolutionary innovations tend to emerge from R&amp;D, while more incremental innovations may emerge from practice – but there are many exceptions to each of these trends.

[[Information technology]] and changing business processes and management style can produce a work climate favorable to innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forbesindia.com/article/ie/new-trends-in-innovation-management/33905/1#ixzz2iiuuDxVq |publisher=Forbes India Magazine |title= New Trends in Innovation Management |website=Forbesindia.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the software tool company [[Atlassian]] conducts quarterly "ShipIt Days" in which employees may work on anything related to the company's products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.atlassian.com/company/about/shipit |title=ShipIt Days |publisher=Atlassian |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Google employees work on self-directed projects for 20% of their time (known as [[Innovation Time Off]]). Both companies cite these bottom-up processes as major sources for new products and features.

An important innovation factor includes customers buying products or using services. As a result, firms may incorporate users in [[focus group]]s (user centred approach), work closely with so called [[lead users]] (lead user approach) or users might adapt their products themselves. The lead user method focuses on idea generation based on leading users to develop breakthrough innovations. U-STIR, a project to innovate [[Europe]]’s surface [[transportation]] system, employs such workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.u-stir.eu/index.phtml?id=2537&amp;ID1=2537&amp;sprache=en |title=U-STIR |publisher=U-stir.eu |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918055455/http://www.u-stir.eu/index.phtml?id=2537&amp;ID1=2537&amp;sprache=en |archivedate=18 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this [[user innovation]], a great deal of innovation is done by those actually implementing and using technologies and products as part of their normal activities. Sometimes user-innovators may become [[entrepreneur]]s, selling their product, they may choose to trade their innovation in exchange for other innovations, or they may be adopted by their suppliers. Nowadays, they may also choose to freely reveal their innovations, using methods like [[open source]]. In such networks of innovation the users or communities of users can further develop technologies and reinvent their social meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Tuomi, I. (2002). ''Networks of Innovation''.

(2010). [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/innovativity-cooperative-learning-business-life-teaching-siltala ''Innovativity and cooperative learning in business life and teaching'']. PhD thesis. University of Turku.&lt;/ref&gt;

One technique for innovating a solution to an identified problem is to actually attempt an experiment with many possible solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/the-mission/forget-about-the-10-000-hour-rule-7b7a39343523 Forget The 10,000-Hour Rule; Edison, Bezos, &amp; Zuckerberg Follow The 10,000-Experiment Rule]. Medium.com (2017-10-26). Retrieved on 2018-10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was famously used by Thomas Edison's laboratory to find a version of the [[incandescent light bulb]] economically viable for home use, which involved searching through thousands of possible [[electrical filament|filament]] designs before settling on carbonized bamboo.

This technique is sometimes used in pharmaceutical [[drug discovery]]. Thousands of chemical compounds are subjected to [[high-throughput screening]] to see if they have any activity against a target molecule which has been identified as biologically significant to a disease. Promising compounds can then be studied; modified to improve efficacy, reduce side effects, and reduce cost of manufacture; and if successful turned into treatments.

The related technique of [[A/B testing]] is often used to help optimize the design of [[web site]]s and [[mobile app]]s.

===Goals and failures===
Programs of organizational innovation are typically tightly linked to organizational goals and objectives, to the [[business plan]], and to [[Market (economics)|market]] [[Competition (companies)|competitive positioning]]. One driver for innovation programs in corporations is to achieve growth objectives. As Davila et al. (2006) notes, "Companies cannot grow through cost reduction and reengineering alone... Innovation is the key element in providing aggressive top-line growth, and for increasing bottom-line results".&lt;ref name="Making Innovation Work"&gt;Davila, T., Epstein, M. J., and Shelton, R. (2006). "Making Innovation Work: How to Manage It, Measure It, and Profit from It." Upper Saddle River: Wharton School Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

One survey across a large number of manufacturing and services organizations found, ranked in decreasing order of popularity, that systematic programs of organizational innovation are most frequently driven by: improved [[quality (business)|quality]], creation of new [[Market (economics)|market]]s, extension of the [[product (business)|product]] range, reduced [[labor cost]]s, improved [[production process]]es, reduced materials, reduced [[environmental damage]], replacement of [[product (business)|product]]s/[[Service (economics)|services]], reduced [[energy]] consumption, conformance to [[regulation]]s.&lt;ref name="Making Innovation Work"/&gt;

These goals vary between improvements to products, processes and services and dispel a popular myth that innovation deals mainly with new product development. Most of the goals could apply to any organisation be it a manufacturing facility, marketing firm, hospital or local government. Whether innovation goals are successfully achieved or otherwise depends greatly on the environment prevailing in the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1287/mnsc.35.5.597|title=Innovative and Noninnovative Small Firms: Types and Characteristics|journal=Management Science|volume=35|issue=5|pages=597–606|year=1989|last1=Khan|first1=Arshad M.|last2=Manopichetwattana|first2=V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, failure can develop in programs of innovations. The causes of failure have been widely researched and can vary considerably. Some causes will be external to the organization and outside its influence of control. Others will be internal and ultimately within the control of the organization. Internal causes of failure can be divided into causes associated with the cultural infrastructure and causes associated with the innovation process itself. Common causes of failure within the innovation process in most organizations can be distilled into five types: poor goal definition, poor alignment of actions to goals, poor participation in teams, poor monitoring of results, poor communication and access to information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=O'Sullivan, David |year=2002|title=Framework for Managing Development in the Networked Organisations|journal=Journal of Computers in Industry|volume= 47|issue=1|pages=77–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diffusion==
[[File:InnovationLifeCycle.jpg|thumb|right]]
{{main|Diffusion of innovations}}

Diffusion of innovation research was first started in 1903 by seminal researcher [[Gabriel Tarde]], who first plotted the S-shaped [[diffusion curve]]. Tarde defined the innovation-decision process as a series of steps that includes:&lt;ref&gt;Tarde, G.  (1903). ''The laws of imitation'' (E. Clews Parsons, Trans.). New York: H. Holt &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;
# First knowledge
# Forming an attitude
# A decision to adopt or reject
# Implementation and use
# Confirmation of the decision

Once innovation occurs, innovations may be spread from the innovator to other individuals and groups. This process has been proposed that the life cycle of innovations can be described using the '[[Sigmoid function|s-curve]]' or [[Diffusion of innovations|diffusion curve]]. The s-curve maps growth of revenue or productivity against time. In the early stage of a particular innovation, growth is relatively slow as the new product establishes itself. At some point, customers begin to demand and the product growth increases more rapidly. New incremental innovations or changes to the product allow growth to continue. Towards the end of its lifecycle, growth slows and may even begin to decline. In the later stages, no amount of new investment in that product will yield a normal rate of return

The s-curve derives from an assumption that new products are likely to have "product life" – i.e., a start-up phase, a rapid increase in revenue and eventual decline. In fact, the great majority of innovations never get off the bottom of the curve, and never produce normal returns.

Innovative companies will typically be working on new innovations that will eventually replace older ones. Successive s-curves will come along to replace older ones and continue to drive growth upwards. In the figure above the first curve shows a current technology. The second shows an [[emerging technologies|emerging technology]] that currently yields lower growth but will eventually overtake current technology and lead to even greater levels of growth. The length of life will depend on many factors.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E. M. (1962). ''Diffusion of Innovation''. New York, NY: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measures==
Measuring innovation is inherently difficult as it implies commensurability so that comparisons can be made in quantitative terms. Innovation, however, is by definition novelty. Comparisons are thus often meaningless across products or service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford handbook of innovation|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Fagerberg, Jan., Mowery, David C., Nelson, Richard R.|isbn=9780199264551|location=Oxford|oclc=56655392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Edison et al.&lt;ref name="Henry2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Edison, H.,  Ali, N.B., &amp; Torkar, R.|doi=10.1016/j.jss.2013.01.013|url=http://www.torkar.se/resources/jss-edisonNT13.pdf |title=Towards innovation measurement in the software industry|journal=Journal of Systems and Software|volume=86|issue=5|pages=1390–1407|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in their review of literature on [[innovation management]] found 232 innovation metrics. They categorized these measures along five dimensions i.e. inputs to the innovation process, output from the innovation process, effect of the innovation output, measures to access the activities in an innovation process and availability of factors that facilitate such a process.&lt;ref name="Henry2013" /&gt;

There are two different types of measures for innovation: the organizational level and the political level.

===Organizational level===
The measure of innovation at the organizational level relates to individuals, team-level assessments, and private companies from the smallest to the largest company. Measure of innovation for organizations can be conducted by surveys, workshops, consultants, or internal benchmarking. There is today no established general way to measure organizational innovation. Corporate measurements are generally structured around [[balanced scorecard]]s which cover several aspects of innovation such as business measures related to finances, innovation process efficiency, employees' contribution and motivation, as well benefits for customers. Measured values will vary widely between businesses, covering for example new product revenue, spending in R&amp;D, time to market, customer and employee perception &amp; satisfaction, number of patents, additional sales resulting from past innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Davila, Tony; Marc J. Epstein and Robert Shelton (2006). ''Making Innovation Work: How to Manage It, Measure It, and Profit from It''. Upper Saddle River: Wharton School Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political level===
For the political level, measures of innovation are more focused on a country or region [[competitive advantage]] through innovation. In this context, organizational capabilities can be evaluated through various evaluation frameworks, such as those of the European Foundation for Quality Management. The [[OECD]] Oslo Manual (1995) suggests standard guidelines on measuring technological product and process innovation. Some people consider the [[Oslo Manual]] complementary to the [[Frascati Manual]] from 1963. The new Oslo manual from 2005 takes a wider perspective to innovation, and includes marketing and organizational innovation. These standards are used for example in the European [[Community Innovation Survey]]s.&lt;ref&gt;OECD The Measurement of Scientific and Technological Activities. Proposed Guidelines for Collecting and Interpreting Technological Innovation Data. Oslo Manual. 2nd edition, DSTI, OECD / European Commission Eurostat, Paris 31 December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other ways of measuring innovation have traditionally been expenditure, for example, investment in R&amp;D (Research and Development) as percentage of GNP (Gross National Product). Whether this is a good measurement of innovation has been widely discussed and the Oslo Manual has incorporated some of the critique against earlier methods of measuring. The traditional methods of measuring still inform many policy decisions. The EU [[Lisbon Strategy]] has set as a goal that their average expenditure on R&amp;D should be 3% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/ |title=Industrial innovation – Enterprise and Industry |publisher=Ec.europa.eu |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827125633/http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/innovation/ |archivedate=27 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Level Down of Innovation in Silicon Valley ===
Innovation is starting to decline due to the newly introduced immigration policies. The new immigration policies have effects on the economy because 25% of the companies were created by foreign entrepreneurs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/08/30/why-startups-are-leaving-silicon-valley|title=Why startups are leaving Silicon Valley|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-09-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indicators===
Many scholars claim that there is a great bias towards the "science and technology mode" (S&amp;T-mode or STI-mode), while the "learning by doing, using and interacting mode" (DUI-mode) is ignored and measurements and research about it rarely done. For example, an institution may be high tech with the latest equipment, but lacks crucial doing, using and interacting tasks important for innovation.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

A common industry view (unsupported by empirical evidence) is that comparative [[cost-effectiveness]] research is a form of [[price controls|price control]] which reduces returns to industry, and thus limits R&amp;D expenditure, stifles future innovation and compromises new products access to markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=19523121|pmc=2881450|year=2009|last1=Chalkidou|first1=K.|title=Comparative effectiveness research and evidence-based health policy: Experience from four countries|journal=The Milbank Quarterly|volume=87|issue=2|pages=339–67|last2=Tunis|first2=S.|last3=Lopert|first3=R.|last4=Rochaix|first4=L.|last5=Sawicki|first5=P. T.|last6=Nasser|first6=M.|last7=Xerri|first7=B.|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00560.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some academics claim cost-effectiveness research is a valuable value-based measure of innovation which accords "truly significant" therapeutic advances (i.e. providing "health gain") higher prices than free market mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roughead |first=E. |last2=Lopert |first2=R. |last3=Sansom |first3=L. |title=Prices for innovative pharmaceutical products that provide health gain: a comparison between Australia and the United States Value |journal=[[Health (journal)|Health]] |year=2007 |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=514–20 |doi=10.1111/j.1524-4733.2007.00206.x |pmid=17970935 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[value-based pricing]] has been viewed as a means of indicating to industry the type of innovation that should be rewarded from the public purse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hughes |first=B. |title=Payers Growing Influence on R&amp;D Decision Making |journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery |year=2008 |volume=7 |issue= 11|pages=876–78 |doi=10.1038/nrd2749 |pmid=18974741 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Australian]] academic developed the case that national comparative [[cost-effectiveness analysis]] systems should be viewed as measuring "health innovation" as an [[evidence-based policy]] concept for valuing innovation distinct from valuing through competitive markets, a method which requires strong [[anti-trust]] laws to be effective, on the basis that both methods of assessing [[pharmaceutical innovations]] are mentioned in annex 2C.1 of the [[AUSFTA|Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faunce |first=T. |last2=Bai |first2=J. |last3=Nguyen |first3=D. |title=Impact of the Australia-US Free Trade Agreement on Australian medicines regulation and prices |journal=[[Journal of Generic Medicines]] |year=2010 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=18–29 |doi=10.1057/jgm.2009.40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Faunce TA|title=Global intellectual property protection of 'innovative' pharmaceuticals: Challenges for bioethics and health law in B Bennett and G Tomossy|publisher=Globalization and Health Springer|date=2006|url=http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Ch%20Globalisation%20and%20Health%20Fau.pdf|format=PDF|website=Law.anu.edu.au|accessdate=18 June 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414040804/http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Ch%20Globalisation%20and%20Health%20Fau.pdf|archivedate=14 April 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Faunce |first=T.

===Rankings===
Many research studies try to rank countries based on measures of innovation. Common areas of focus include: [[high-tech]] companies, [[manufacturing]], [[patent]]s, [[post secondary education]], [[research and development]],  and research personnel. The left ranking of the top 10 countries below is based on the 2016 [[Bloomberg Innovation Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-01-19/these-are-the-world-s-most-innovative-economies|title=These Are the World's Most Innovative Economies|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, studies may vary widely; for example the [[Global Innovation Index]] 2016 ranks [[Switzerland]] as number one wherein countries like [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]] do not even make the top ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://de.statista.com/infografik/5509/die-10-innovativsten-laender-weltweit-nach-dem-global-innovation-index/|title=Infografik: Schweiz bleibt globaler Innovationsführer|last=|first=|date=|website=Statista Infografiken|publisher=Statista (In German)|access-date=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future ===
In 2005 [[Jonathan Huebner]], a [[physicist]] working at the [[Pentagon Building|Pentagon]]'s [[Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake|Naval Air Warfare Center]], argued on the basis of both U.S. [[patent]]s and world technological breakthroughs, per capita, that the rate of human technological innovation peaked in 1873 and has been slowing ever since.&lt;ref name=Huebner&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Huebner | first1 = J. | title = A possible declining trend for worldwide innovation | doi = 10.1016/j.techfore.2005.01.003 | journal = [[Technological Forecasting and Social Change]] | volume = 72 | issue = 8 | pages = 980–986 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/050707/7inventor.htm|title=Science: Wanna be an inventor? Don't bother| last=Hayden|first=Thomas|date=7 July 2005|work=U.S. News &amp; World Report|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his article, he asked "Will the level of technology reach a maximum and then decline as in the Dark Ages?"&lt;ref name=Huebner/&gt; In later comments to ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine, Huebner clarified that while he believed that we will reach a rate of innovation in 2024 equivalent to that of the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], he was not predicting the reoccurrence of the Dark Ages themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Adler|first=Robert|title=Entering a dark age of innovation|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7616-entering-a-dark-age-of-innovation.html|accessdate=30 May 2013|newspaper=New Scientist|date=2 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Smart]] criticized the claim and asserted that [[technological singularity]] researcher [[Ray Kurzweil]] and others showed a "clear trend of acceleration, not deceleration" when it came to innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Smart | first1 = J. | title = Discussion of Huebner article | doi = 10.1016/j.techfore.2005.07.001 | journal = [[Technological Forecasting and Social Change]] | volume = 72 | issue = 8 | pages = 988–995 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation replied to Huebner the journal his article was published in, citing [[Second Life]] and [[eHarmony]] as proof of accelerating innovation; to which Huebner replied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huebner|first1=Jonathan|title=Response by the Authors|journal=[[Technological Forecasting and Social Change]]|volume=72|issue=8|pages=995–1000|doi=10.1016/j.techfore.2005.05.008|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, Huebner's findings were confirmed in 2010 with [[U.S. Patent Office]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Strumsky | first1 = D. | last2 = Lobo | first2 = J. | last3 = Tainter | first3 = J.

The theme of innovation as a tool to disrupting patterns of poverty has gained momentum since the mid-2000s among major [[international development]] actors such as [[DFID]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dfid.blog.gov.uk/author/jonathan-wong-head-of-dfids-innovation-hub/ |title=Jonathan Wong, Head of DFID's Innovation Hub &amp;#124; DFID bloggers |website=Dfid.blog.gov.uk |date=2014-09-24 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gates Foundation]]'s use of the [[Grand Challenge]] funding model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Media-Center/Press-Releases/2014/10/Gates-Foundation-Grand-Challenges-Breakthrough-Science |title=Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and Grand Challenge Partners Commit to Innovation with New Investments in Breakthrough Science – Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation |website=Gatesfoundation.org |date=2014-10-07 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[USAID]]'s Global Development Lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaid.gov/GlobalDevLab |title=Global Development Lab &amp;#124; U.S. Agency for International Development |website=Usaid.gov |date=2015-08-05 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Networks have been established to support innovation in development, such as D-Lab at [[MIT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d-lab.mit.edu/idin |title=International Development Innovation Network (IDIN) &amp;#124; D-Lab |website=D-lab.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investment funds have been established to identify and catalyze innovations in [[developing countries]], such as DFID's Global Innovation Fund,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/international-development-funding/global-innovation-fund |title=Global Innovation Fund International development funding |website=GOV.UK |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Development Innovation Fund]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.hdif-tz.org |title=Human Development Innovation Fund (HDIF) |website=Hdif-tz.org |date=2015-08-14 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (in partnership with USAID) the Global Development Innovation Ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/usaid-and-dfid-announce-global-development-innovation-ventures |title=USAID and DFID Announce Global Development Innovation Ventures to Invest in Breakthrough Solutions to World Poverty &amp;#124; U.S. Agency for International Development |website=Usaid.gov |date=2013-06-06 |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government policies==
Given the noticeable effects on [[efficiency]], [[quality of life]], and [[productivity|productive growth]], innovation is a key factor in society and economy. Consequently, policymakers have long worked to develop environments that will foster innovation and its resulting positive benefits, from funding [[Research and Development]] to supporting regulatory change, funding the development of innovation clusters, and using public purchasing and standardisation to 'pull' innovation through.

For instance, experts are advocating that the U.S. federal government launch a National Infrastructure Foundation, a nimble, collaborative strategic intervention organization that will house innovations programs from fragmented silos under one entity, inform federal officials on innovation [[performance measurement|performance metrics]], strengthen industry-university partnerships, and support innovation [[economic development]] initiatives, especially to strengthen [[business cluster|regional clusters]]. Because clusters are the geographic incubators of innovative products and processes, a cluster development grant program would also be targeted for implementation. By focusing on innovating in such areas as precision [[manufacturing]], [[information technology]], and [[clean energy]], other areas of national concern would be tackled including [[government debt]], [[carbon footprint]], and [[oil dependence]].&lt;ref name="MetroPolicy"/&gt; The U.S. [[Economic Development Administration]] understand this reality in their continued Regional Innovation Clusters initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eda.gov/PDF/EDA_FY_2010_Annual_Report.pdf |format=PDF |title=U.S. Economic Development Administration : Fiscal Year 2010 Annual Report |website=Eda.gov |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, federal grants in R&amp;D, a crucial driver of innovation and productive growth, should be expanded to levels similar to [[Japan]], [[Finland]], [[South Korea]], and [[Switzerland]] in order to stay globally competitive. Also, such grants should be better procured to [[metropolitan economy|metropolitan areas]], the essential engines of the American economy.&lt;ref name="MetroPolicy"/&gt;

Many countries recognize the importance of research and development as well as innovation including Japan's [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mext.go.jp/english/a06.htm |title=Science and Technology |publisher=MEXT |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905171421/http://www.mext.go.jp/english/a06.htm |archivedate=5 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmbf.de/en/Ministry.php |title=BMBF " Ministry |publisher=Bmbf.de |date= |accessdate=7 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Science and Technology]] in the People's Republic of China. Furthermore, Russia's innovation programme is the [[Medvedev modernisation programme]] which aims at creating a diversified economy based on high technology and innovation. Also, the [[Government of Western Australia]] has established a number of innovation incentives for government departments. [[Landgate]] was the first Western Australian government agency to establish its Innovation Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landgate.wa.gov.au/innovation |title=Home  |publisher=Landgate Innovation Program |website=Landgate.wa.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2016-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Regions]] have taken a more proactive role in supporting innovation. Many regional governments are setting up [[regional innovation agency]] to strengthen regional innovation capabilities. In [[Medellin]], [[Colombia]], the municipality of Medellin created in 2009 [[Ruta N]] to transform the city into a knowledge city.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23792949.2018.1538702?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Başlıca İslâm çini ve keramik merkezleri.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Chief places named in connection with Islamic pottery.]]

Medieval '''Islamic pottery''' occupied a geographical position between [[Chinese ceramics]], then the unchallenged leaders of Eurasian production, and the pottery of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and Europe.  For most of the period it can fairly be said to have been between the two in terms of aesthetic achievement and influence as well, borrowing from China and exporting to and influencing Byzantium and Europe. The use of drinking and eating vessels in gold and silver, the ideal in ancient Rome and Persia as well as medieval Christian societies, is prohibited by the [[Hadith]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.searchtruth.com/book_display.php?book=24&amp;translator=2 Hadithic texts against gold and silver vessels]&lt;/ref&gt; with the result that pottery and glass were used for tableware by Muslim elites, as pottery (but less often glass) also was in China, but was much rarer in Europe and Byzantium.  In the same way Islamic restrictions greatly discouraged figurative wall-painting, encouraging the architectural use of schemes of decorative and often [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometrically-patterned]] [[tile]]s, which are the most distinctive and original speciality of Islamic ceramics.

The era of Islamic [[pottery]] started around 622. From 633, [[Muslim]] armies moved rapidly towards [[Sassanid Empire|Persia]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Anatolia]], [[Egypt]] and later [[Andalusia]]. The early history of Islamic pottery remains somewhat obscure and speculative as little evidence has survived.  Apart from tiles which escaped destruction due to their use in architectural decoration of buildings and mosques, much early medieval pottery vanished.

The Muslim world inherited significant pottery industries in Mesopotamia, [[Persia]], Egypt, North Africa ([[African Red Slip]]) and later other regions. Indeed, the origin of glazed pottery has been traced to Egypt where it was first introduced during the fourth millennium BCE.  However most of these traditions made heavy use of figurative decoration, which was greatly reduced, though not entirely removed, under Islam.  Instead Islamic pottery developed geometric and plant-based decoration to a very high level, and made more use of decorative schemes made up of many tiles than any previous culture.

A distinct Muslim style in pottery was not firmly established until the 9th century in [[Iraq]] (formerly Mesopotamia), [[Syria]] and [[Persia]].  During this period pieces mainly used white [[tin-glaze]].  Information on earlier periods is very limited.  This is largely due to the lack of surviving specimens in good condition which also limits the interest in the study of ceramics of these periods.  Archaeological excavations carried out in Jordan uncovered only a few examples from the Umayyad period, mostly unglazed vessels from Khirbat Al-Mafjar.&lt;ref&gt;Baramki, D.C., "The pottery from Khirbet El-Mefjer", ''The Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine'' (QDAP 1942),  vol. 10, pp.65-103&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sauer, J.A., "Umayyad pottery from sites in East Jordan2, ''Jordan'', Vol.4, 1975, pp.25-32.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the East, evidence shows that a production centre was set up in [[Samarkand]] under the [[Samanid]] dynasty who ruled this region and parts of [[Persia]] between 874 and 999 A.D.  The most highly regarded technique of this centre is the use of [[calligraphy]] in the decoration of vessels.  East Persian pottery from the 9th to 11th centuries decorated only with highly stylised inscriptions, called "epigraphic ware", has been described as "probably the most refined and sensitive of all Persian pottery".&lt;ref&gt;Arts, p. 223. see nos. 278-290&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese influence===
{{main article|Chinese influences on Islamic pottery}}
During the Abbasid dynasty pottery production gained momentum, largely using tin glazes mostly in the form of opaque white glaze.  Some historians, such as Arthur Lane, attribute the rise of such industry to Chinese influence. Evidence from Muslim manuscripts, such as Akhbar al-Sin wa al-Hind (circa 851) and Ibn Kurdadhbih’s Book of Roads and Provinces (846-885), suggest that trade with China was firmly established. Lane also referred to the passage in a work written by Muhammad ibn al-Husayn al-Baihaki, (circa 1059) where he stated that the governor of Khurasan, ‘Ali ibn ‘Isa, sent as a present to the Caliph Harun al-Rashid (786-809), “twenty pieces of Chinese Imperial [[porcelain]] (Chini faghfuri),  the like of which had never been seen at a Caliph’s court before, in addition to 2,000 other pieces of porcelain”.
[[File:Plate dragon Louvre MAO696.jpg|thumb|Plate with dragon. Persia, 17th century, inspired by 15th-century Chinese blue and white porcelain]]

According to Lane, the influence of Chinese pottery progressed in three main phases.  The first contact with [[China]] took place in 751 when the Arabs defeated the Chinese at the [[Battle of Talas]].  It has been argued that imprisoned Chinese potters and paper makers could have taught the Muslims the art of pottery and paper-making.  In 800’s Chinese stoneware and porcelain reached the Abbasids.  The second phase took place in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a period noted for the decline of pottery industry following the fall of the Seljuk dynasty.  This period also saw the invasion of the Mongols who brought Chinese pottery traditions.

The influence of ceramics from the [[Tang Dynasty]] can be seen on [[lustreware]]s, produced by [[Mesopotamia]]n potters, and on some early white wares excavated at [[Samarra]] (in modern-day [[Iraq]]). Ceramics from this period were excavated at [[Nishapur]] (in modern-day [[Iran]]) and [[Samarkand]] (in modern-day [[Uzbekistan]]).

[[File:Early blue and white ware circa 1335 Jingdezhen.jpg|thumb|Early Chinese [[blue and white porcelain]], c 1335, early [[Yuan dynasty]], [[Jingdezhen]], using a Middle-eastern shape]]
By the time of the [[Mongol invasion of China]] a considerable export trade westwards to the Islamic world was established, and Islamic attempts to imitate Chinese porcelain in their own [[fritware]] bodies had begun in the 12th century. These were less successful than those of [[Korean pottery]], but eventually were able to provide attractive local competition to Chinese imports.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, Ch. 5, pp. 134, 140-141 especially&lt;/ref&gt;  Chinese production could adapt to the preferences of foreign markets; larger [[celadon]] dishes than the Chinese market wanted were favoured for serving princely banquets in the Middle East.  Celadon wares were believed there to have the ability to detect poison, by sweating or breaking.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 136-137&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islamic market was apparently especially important in the early years of [[Chinese blue and white porcelain]], which appears to have been mainly exported until the Ming.  Again, large dishes were an export style, and the densely painted decoration of Yuan blue and white borrowed heavily from the [[arabesque]]s and [[scroll (art)|plant scrolls]] of Islamic decoration, probably mostly taking the style from metalwork examples, which also provided shapes for some vessels.  This style of ornament was then confined to blue and white, and is not found in the red and white painted wares then preferred by the Chinese themselves.  The [[cobalt blue]] that was used was itself imported from Persia, and the export trade in porcelain was handled by colonies of Muslim merchants in [[Quanzhou]], convenient for the huge [[Jingdezhen]] potteries, and other ports to the south.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 137-140&lt;/ref&gt;

The start of the [[Ming dynasty]] was quickly followed by a decree of 1368, forbidding trade with foreign countries.  This was not entirely successful, and had to be repeated several times, and the giving of lavish imperial diplomatic gifts continued, concentrating on silk and porcelain (19,000 pieces of porcelain in 1383), but it severely set back the export trade. The policy was relaxed under the next emperor after 1403, but had by then greatly stimulated the production of pottery emulating Chinese styles in the Islamic world itself, which was by now reaching a high level of quality in several countries (high enough to fool contemporary Europeans in many cases).&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 140-142&lt;/ref&gt;

Often Islamic production imitated not the latest Chinese styles, but those of the late Yuan and early Ming.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 140-141&lt;/ref&gt;  In turn, Chinese potters began in the early 16th century to produce some items in overtly Islamic styles, including jumbled inscriptions in Arabic. These appear to have been made for the growing Chinese Muslim market, and probably those at court wishing to keep up with the [[Zhengde Emperor]]'s (r. 1505-1521) flirtation with Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Vainker, 142-143&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic innovations===
{{see also|Hispano-Moresque ware|İznik pottery|Alchemy and chemistry in Islam}}

From between the eighth and eighteenth centuries, the use of [[Ceramic glaze|glazed ceramics]] was prevalent in Islamic art, usually assuming the form of elaborate [[pottery]].&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995) p.1&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tin-glazing|Tin-opacified glazing]], for the production of [[tin-glazed pottery]], was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters.  The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in [[Basra]], dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of [[stoneware]] originating in 9th-century Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995) p.5&lt;/ref&gt; It was a vitreous or semivitreous ceramic ware of fine texture, made primarily from non-refactory fire clay.&lt;ref&gt;Standard Terminology Of Ceramic Whiteware and Related Products. ASTM Standard C242.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other centres for innovative pottery in the Islamic world included [[Fustat]] (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and [[Tabriz]] (from 1470 to 1550).&lt;ref&gt;Mason (1995) p.7&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cup lustre Louvre OA8179.jpg|thumb|left|9th-century [[lustreware]] bowl from [[Iraq]]]]

[[Lusterware]] was produced  in [[Mesopotamia]] in the 9th century; the technique soon became popular in [[History of Iran|Persia]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ten thousand years of pottery'', Emmanuel Cooper, University of Pennsylvania Press, 4th ed., 2000, {{ISBN|0-8122-3554-1}}, pp. 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Lusterware was later produced in [[Egypt]] during the [[Fatimid]] caliphate in the 10th-12th centuries. While some production of lustreware  continued in the [[Middle East]], it spread to [[Europe]]&amp;mdash;first in the [[Hispano-Moresque ware]] of [[Al-Andalus]], notably at [[Málaga]], and then [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], then later to Italy, where it was used to enhance [[maiolica]].

Another innovation was the [[albarello]], a type of [[maiolica]] earthenware jar originally designed to hold [[Apothecary|apothecaries']] ointments and dry drugs. The development of this type of [[pharmacy]] jar had its roots in the Islamic Middle East. Brought to Italy from Spain, the earliest Italian examples were produced in Florence in the 15th century.

[[Fritware]] refers to a type of pottery which was first developed in the Near East, where production is dated to the late first millennium AD through the second millennium AD. [[Frit]] was a significant ingredient. A recipe for “fritware” dating to c. 1300 AD written by Abu’l Qasim reports that the ratio of quartz to “frit-glass” to white clay is 10:1:1.&lt;ref&gt;A.K. Bernsted 2003, ''Early Islamic Pottery: Materials and Techniques'', London: Archetype Publications Ltd., 25; R.B. Mason and M.S. Tite 1994, The Beginnings of Islamic Stonepaste Technology, ''Archaeometry'' 36.1: 77&lt;/ref&gt; This type of pottery has also been referred to as “stoneware" and “faience” among other names.&lt;ref&gt;Mason and Tite 1994, 77.&lt;/ref&gt; A ninth-century corpus of “proto-stoneware” from [[Baghdad]] has “relict glass fragments” in its fabric.&lt;ref&gt;Mason and Tite 1994, 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt; The glass is alkali-lime-lead-silica and, when the paste was fired or cooled, wollastonite and [[diopside]] crystals formed within the glass fragments.&lt;ref&gt;Mason and Tite 1994, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of “inclusions of crushed [[pottery]]” suggests these fragments did not come from a glaze.&lt;ref name="Masonand"&gt;Mason and Tite 1994, 87.&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for their addition would be to act as a flux, and so “accelerate vitrification at a relatively low firing temperature, and thus increase the [[hardness]] and [[density]] of the [ceramic] body.”&lt;ref name="Masonand" /&gt;

==Middle (1200–1400)==
[[File:Albarello fleur-de-lys Louvre UCAD4288.jpg|thumb|Albarello with fleur-de-lys decoration, early 14th century, Syria, musée du Louvre]]
By this period the distinctive Islamic tradition of decorated wall tiles had emerged, and continued to develop together with vessel pottery in a way unique to [[Islamic art]].  In the account of Ibn Naji (circa 1016) the Caliph sent, in addition to tiles, “a man from [[Baghdad]]” to Qairawan to produce lustre tiles for the [[mihrab]] of the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque]] (still well preserved). Georges Marcais suggested that Iraqi potters indeed came to Quairawan. The arrival of this Baghdadi potter must have led to the establishment of a satellite centre for the production of ceramics in [[Quairawan]], but no information has yet been developed to confirm or deny this suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;Marcais G., ''Les faiences a reflets metalliques de la grande Mosquee de Kairouan'', Paris, 1928, pp.10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The events leading to the collapse of the [[Fatimid]] reign in 1171 caused ceramic production to move out to new centres, via processes similar to those described above with respect to [[Iraq]].  As a result, Persia  became a centre of revival under the Seljuk rule (1038–1327).  This is not coincidental as the Seljuks expanded their rule over Persia, Iraq, Syria, and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], as well as [[Anatolia]] and Muslim [[Asia Minor]].   All of these had been, for some considerable time, centres of old pottery.
[[File:Coupe iran.JPG|thumb|left|Bowl with hunters, [[Persian pottery]] from 12th–13th century.]]
The Seljuks brought new and fresh inspiration to the Muslim world, attracting artists, craftsmen and potters from all regions including Egypt.  In addition to continuing the production of similar (although more refined) [[Tin-glazing|tin]] and lustre glaze ceramics, the Seljuks (in Persia) were credited for the introduction of a new type sometimes known as "Faience". This is made from a hard white [[frit]] paste coated with transparent [[alkaline]] glaze.

[[Hispano-Moresque ware]] emerged in [[Al-Andaluz]] in the 13th century, probably after potters escaped the instability after the fall of the Fatimids.  It introduced lustreware manufacture to Europe and from the start was widely exported to the elites of Christian kingdoms.  The first centre was [[Málaga]], producing wares in traditional Islamic styles, but from the 13th century Muslim potters migrated to the [[Reconquista|reconquered]] Christian city of [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], outlying suburbs of which such as [[Manises]] and [[Paterna]] became the most important centres, manufacturing mainly for Christian markets in styles increasingly influenced by European decoration, though retaining a distinct character.  The potters were mostly still Muslim or [[Morisco]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alan Caiger-Smith|Caiger-Smith, Alan]], ''Lustre Pottery: Technique, Tradition and Innovation in Islam and the Western World'', Chapters 6 &amp; 7, (Faber and Faber, 1985) {{ISBN|0-571-13507-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In a rare manuscript from Kashan compiled by Abulqassim in 1301, there is a complete description of how faience production was carried out.  Frit was made of ten parts of powdered [[quartz]], one part of clay and one part of glaze mixture. The addition of greater amounts of clay made [[Pottery#Methods of shaping|wheel throwing]] of the faience easier, and allowed a better quality of work, because otherwise the material had little plasticity.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Allan,''The History of So-Called Egyptian Faience in Islamic Persia''[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:ToZNNX9ByKcJ:onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-4754.1973.tb00087.x/pdf+clay+in+Islamic+Faience&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjQqKQNJACMRhHBF4olfMRaqbohZCsx8Lzwp62x9CoF89N2Aqg7g_vIfVaSHY9gbxiS3kL65qWZmc1bHicjUsSazPR8peLN5zIfbVa_8Vp44i0a6ajlDRCvUszsfBW51oW5z3kf&amp;sig=AHIEtbS8aaJN_ZqzN-NjalLSjuYd5tmE_A]&lt;/ref&gt;  The glaze itself is “formed of a roughly equal mixture of ground quartz and the ashes of desert plants which contain a very high proportion of alkaline salts.  These act as a [[flux]] and cause the quartz to vitrify at a manageable temperature.  The two alone will produce a transparent glaze”.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, O., ''Persian Lustre Ware'', London 1985, .p.32. Cited in Febervari Gesa (2000), op., cit, .p.96&lt;/ref&gt; Lane compared this material with the French pâte tender, which was used by potters as recently as the eighteenth century.  This body material and the new glaze offered the potter a greater handling and manipulation ability.  This allows the potter to improve the quality and appearance of the vessel, including more refined decorative designs and patterns. The result was a substantial variety of products such as bowls of different size and shapes, jugs, incense burners, lamps, candlesticks, trays, tiles and so on.  These advantages also allowed greater control of carved decoration, the use of which the Seljuks refined and extended during the twelfth century.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, A. (1947) ''Early Islamic Pottery'', Faber and Faber, London&lt;/ref&gt;

Carved decoration in ceramics, [[sgraffito]], is an old tradition used in ninth-century Islamic pottery; it is an engraving technique based on incising the design with a sharp tool through a white [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] to reveal the red [[earthenware]] body. The vessel is then coated with glaze.

The Seljuks also developed the so-called silhouette wares which are distinguished by their black background.  These are produced by a technique which consists of coating the white [[fritware]] body with a thick black [[slip (ceramics)|slip]], out of which the decoration is then carved.  Later, a coat of colourless or coloured, usually blue or green, transparent glaze is applied.  According to Lane, this technique was used, in a simpler form, in Samarkand between the ninth and tenth centuries.  The method then consisted of mixing the colours with a thick opaque clay slip instead.

The influence of [[Blue and white porcelain]] of the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming dynasties]] is evident in many ceramics made by Muslim potters. [[İznik pottery]] from around [[İznik]] in [[Anatolia]] was supported by the Ottoman court and produced the finest [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] work in pottery and panels of tiles, using the same vocabulary of bold and elegant floral designs derived from Chinese decoration.  A characteristic bold red was developed.  İznik ware had a major influence on [[Europe]]an decorative arts: for example, on Italian [[Maiolica]].  The pottery was produced in as early as the 15th century AD, and was preceded by [[Miletus ware]] from the same region.&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Tite 1989, İznik Pottery: An Investigation of the Methods of Production, ''Archaeometry'' 31.2: 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Its best period lasted until the late 16th century.  It consists of a body, [[slip (ceramics)|slip]], and glaze, where the body and glaze are “quartz-frit.”&lt;ref&gt;Tite 1989, 120.&lt;/ref&gt; The “frits” in both cases “are unusual in that they contain [[lead(II) oxide|lead oxide]] as well as [[sodium oxide|soda]]”; the lead oxide would help reduce the [[coefficient of thermal expansion|thermal expansion coefficient]] of the ceramic.&lt;ref&gt;Tite 1989, 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Microscopic analysis reveals that the material that has been labeled “frit” is “interstitial glass” which serves to connect the quartz particles.&lt;ref&gt;Tite 1989, 120, 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael S. Tite argues that this glass was added as frit and that the interstitial glass formed on firing.&lt;ref&gt;Tite 1989, 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 15th century saw the finest period of the [[Hispano-Moresque ware]] of Valencia, produced by largely Muslim potters in a Christian kingdom, though the southern industry centred on Málaga had ended by the mid-century.  Persian pottery under the [[Safavid dynasty]] (from 1502) was also heavily influenced by Chinese blue and white porcelain, which to a large extent replaced it in court circles; fine 16th-century Persian pieces are very rare.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Mitchell, p. 262, no. 395&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Islamic parts of [[Southeast Asia]], modern [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]], were export markets that were close at hand for the Chinese and later the Japanese, helped by the European trading companies, especially the [[Dutch East India Company]].  The Buddhist countries of the region also exported.  Special types of wares were developed for them, such as the Chinese [[Kraak ware]] and [[Swatow ware]], mostly producing large dishes for serving communally to a table. In the face of such competion, local wares were few and simple.   

The Islamic world as a whole never managed to develop [[porcelain]], but had an avid appetite for imports of it.  East Asian porcelain, first Chinese then [[Japanese export porcelain]] in the 17th century, was joined in the 18th century by the wares from Europe, in particular [[Vienna porcelain]], which specialized in the Eastern market, and by the latter part of the century was sending as many as 120,000 pieces per year to the [[Ottoman Empire]], many small cups and saucers for [[Turkish coffee]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Battie|Battie, David]], ed., ''Sotheby's Concise Encyclopedia of Porcelain'', p. 96, 1990, Conran Octopus. {{ISBN|1850292515}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The smaller scale factories of the Islamic world could not compete with the sophisticated imports arriving from both east and west, and local production became a craft affair, repeating now-traditional patterns.

==Study of Islamic pottery==
Arthur Lane produced two books which made substantial contribution to understanding the history and merit of Muslim ceramics.  The first book was dedicated to the study of early ceramics from the [[Abbasid]] period till the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] times, sketching the various events which played a significant role in the rise and fall of particular styles.  In his second work, Lane used the same rhetorical style adopted in the first book, this time devoting his attention to later periods from the Mongols to nineteenth-century [[İznik pottery|İznik]] and Persian pottery.

Following Lane's works, numerous studies appeared. The most comprehensive works adopting a general view are those by [[R.L. Hobson]], [[Ernst J. Grube]], [[Richard Ettinghausen]], and more recently [[Alan Caiger-Smith]] and [[Gesa Febervari]].  Additional contributions were made by those specializing in particular temporal or regional history of Muslim pottery such as [[Georges Marcais]] in his work on North Africa, [[Oliver Watson]] on Persia and [[J.R. Hallett]] on Abbasid Pottery.

'''Language geography''' is the branch of [[human geography]] that studies the geographic distribution of language(s) or its constituent elements. There are two principal fields of study within the geography of language: 
# "''geography of languages''", which deals with the distribution through history and space of languages,&lt;ref&gt;Delgado de Carvalho, C.M. (1962). ''The geography of languages.'' In Wagner, P.L.; Mikesell, M.W. ''Readings in cultural geography.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 75-93.&lt;/ref&gt; and/or is concerned with 'the analysis of the distribution patterns and spatial structures of languages in contact'.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, C.H. (1980). ''Language contact and language change in Wales, 1901-1971: a study in historical geolinguistics.'' Welsh History Review 10, 207-238.&lt;/ref&gt;
# "''[[geolinguistics]]''" being, when used as a sub-discipline of geography, the study of the 'political, economic and cultural processes that affect the status and distribution of languages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunnemark|first=Erik|year=1991|title=What is geolinguistics ?|trans-title=|url=|journal=Geolinguistics, journal of the American Society of geolinguistics.|publisher=American Society of Geolinguistics|volume=17|page=12|pages=|issn=0190-4671|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When perceived as a sub-discipline of linguistics which incorporates contact linguistics, one definition appearing has been 'the study of languages and dialects in contact and in conflict with various societal, economic, ideological, political and other contemporary trends with regard to a particular geographic location and on a planetary scale'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://politlinguist.ru/announcements/17.doc|title=International Conference on multilingual perspectives in geolinguistics, April 11, 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Dictionary of Human Geography'', Gregory, Derek; Smith, David M., Second edition, Oxford: Blackwell, 252-3.&lt;/ref&gt; including

''[https://www.academia.edu/2013163/Mapping_the_languages_of_Europe Mapping the languages of Europe]'' in Herberts K., Laurén C., Laurén U, Strömann S. (Eds.): "Flerspråkighetens dimensioner. Individ, familj och samhälle", Vaasan Yliopiston Julkaisuja: Vaasa/Vasa, 103-131.&lt;/ref&gt; which deals with regional linguistic variations within languages,&lt;ref&gt;Pei, M. (1966).

Linguistic geography can also refer to studies of how people talk about the landscape. For example, [[toponymy]] is the study of place names.&lt;ref name="Toponymy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadmon|first1=Naftali|title=Toponymy : the lore, laws, and language of geographical names|date=2000|publisher=Vantage Press|location=New York|isbn=0533135311|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landscape ethnoecology, also known as ethnophysiography, is the study of landscape ontologies and how they are expressed in language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Johnson|editor1-first=Leslie Main|editor2-last=Hunn|editor2-first=Eugene S.|title=Landscape Ethnoecology: Concepts of Biotic and Physical Space|date=2012|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many studies in what is now called contact linguistics have researched the effect of [[language contact]],&lt;ref&gt;Weinrich, U. (1974). ''Languages in contact.'' The Hague: Mouton.&lt;/ref&gt; as the languages or dialects (varieties) of peoples have interacted.&lt;ref name=Dict/&gt; This territorial expansion of language groups has usually resulted in the overlaying of languages upon existing speech areas, rather than the replacement of one language by another. An example could be sought in the [[Norman Conquest of England]]: [[Old French]] became the language of the aristocracy but [[Middle English]] remained the language of the majority of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Burchfield, Robert [1985] (2003). ''The English Language'', New York: Oxford University Press, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linguistic geography ==
Linguistic geography, as a field, is dominated by [[Linguistics|linguists]] rather than [[geographer]]s.&lt;ref name=Trud3/&gt; [[Charles W. J. Withers]] describes the difference as resulting from a focus on "elements of language, and only then with their geographical or social variation, as opposed to investigation of the processes making for change in the extent of language areas."&lt;ref name=Dict/&gt; [[Peter Trudgill]] says, "linguistic geography has been geographical only in the sense that it has been concerned with the spatial distribution of linguistic phenomena."&lt;ref name=Trud2/&gt; Greater emphasis has been laid upon explanation rather than mere description of the patterns of linguistic change.&lt;ref name=Trud3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dict/&gt; That move has paralleled similar concerns in [[geography]] and language studies.&lt;ref&gt;Withers, C.W.J. (1984). ''Gaelic in Scotland 1698-1981: the geographical history of a language.'' Edinburgh: John Donald; Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Some studies have paid attention to the social use&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2009). Language ecology and linguistic landscape analysis. In E. Shohamy &amp; D. Gorter (Eds.), ''Linguistic landscape: Expanding the scenery'' (pp. 88-104). London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; of language and to variations in dialect within languages in regard to [[social class]] or occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Giglioli, P.P. (1972). ''Language and social context.'' Harmondsworth: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding such variations, lexicographer [[Robert Burchfield]] notes that their nature "is a matter of perpetual discussion and disagreement" and notes that "most professional linguistic scholars regard it as axiomatic that all varieties of English have a sufficiently large vocabulary for the expression of all the distinctions that are important in the society using it." He contrasts this with the view of the historian [[John Vincent (historian)|John Vincent]], who regards such a view as

{{quote|"a nasty little orthodoxy among the educational and linguistic establishment. However badly you need standard English, you will have the merits of non-standard English waved at you. The more extravagantly your disadvantages will be lauded as 'entirely adequate for the needs of their speakers', to cite the author of ''Sociolinguistics''. It may sound like a radical cry to support pidgin, patois, or dialect, but translated into social terms, it looks more like a ploy to keep Them (whoever Them may be) out of the middle-class suburbs."|John Vincent|The Times&lt;ref&gt;''The Times, 23 February 1983, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Burchfield concludes, "Resolution of such opposite views is not possible.... future of dialect studies and the study of class-marked distinctions are likely to be of considerable interest to everyone."&lt;ref&gt;Burchfield, Robert [1985] (2003). ''The English Language'', New York: Oxford University Press, 128-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England]], linguistic geography has traditionally focused upon rural English,rather than urban English.&lt;ref&gt;In 1985, one could still say, "We still know far more about the distribution of ''byre/shippon/mistall/cow-stable/cow-house/cow-shed/neat-house/beast-house'' for 'cow-shed' than we do about urban synonyms  for pedestrian crossings, lollipop men, machines used to wash cars, forecourts of petrol stations, bollards, sleeping policemen, pay-out desks, supermarket trolleys, traffic wardens, telephone booths and hundreds of other items found in every city in the United Kingdom." Burchfield, Robert [1985] (2003). ''The English Language'', New York: Oxford University Press, 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  A common production of linguistic investigators of dialects is the shaded and dotted map showing to show where one linguistic feature ends and another begins or overlaps. Various compilations of these maps for England have been issued over the years, including Joseph Wright's ''English Dialect Dictionary'' (1896–1905), the ''[[Survey of English Dialects]]'' (1962-8), and ''The Linguistic Atlas of England'' (1978).&lt;ref&gt;Burchfield, Robert [1985] (2003). ''The English Language'', New York: Oxford University Press, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geolinguistic organizations ==

Most [[geolinguistic organizations]] identify themselves as associations of linguists rather than of geographers. This includes the two oldest which both date to 1965 with "Amici Linguarum" (language friends) being founded by [http://www.kebi.se/erikgunnemark/engindex.html Erik V. Gunnemark] and The American Society of Geolinguistics by Prof. [[Mario A. Pei]]. The research in [[geolinguistics]] which these organizations and others, which are more geographically oriented, promote is often interdisciplinary, being at times simultaneously both linguistic and geographic, and also being at times linked to other sub-disciplines of linguistics as well as going beyond linguistics to connect to sociology, anthropology, ethnology, history, demographics, political science, studies of cognition and communication, etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11755">In the field of [[pedagogy]], '''learning by teaching''' (German: ''Lernen durch Lehren'', short '''LdL''') is a method of teaching in which students are made to learn material and prepare [[lesson]]s to teach it to the other students. There is a strong emphasis on acquisition of [[life skills]] along with the subject matter. This method was originally defined by [[Jean-Pol Martin]] in the 1980s.

== Background ==
[[Image:Ldl-wortschatz.jpg|thumb|250px|Student teaching vocabulary]]
The method of having students teach other students has been present since antiquity.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus&gt;{{cite news |last1=Heinrich |first1=Christian |title=Learning by Teaching: The Goal is Independence |url=http://www.goethe.de/ges/spa/prj/sog/mud/en3913352.htm |work=Goethe-Institut |date=November 2007 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most often this was due to lack of resources.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;  For example, the [[Monitorial System]] was an education method that became popular on a global scale during the early 19th century. It was developed in parallel by  Scotsman [[Andrew Bell (educationalist)|Andrew Bell]] who had worked in [[Madras]] and [[Joseph Lancaster]] who worked in London; each attempted to educate masses of poor children with scant resources by having older children teach younger children what they had already learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graves |first1=Frank Pierrepont |title=A Student's History of Education |date=1915 |publisher=Macmillan Company |pages=239ff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zPQTAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA239 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic research into intentionally improving education, by having students learn by teaching began in the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gartner |first1=Alan |last2=Kohler |first2=Mary Conway |last3=Riessman |first3=Frank |title=Children teach children; learning by teaching |date=1971 |publisher=Harper &amp; Row |location=New York |isbn=0-06-013553-0 |edition= 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, [[Jean-Pol Martin]] systematically developed the concept of having students teach other in the context of learning [[French language|French]] as a [[foreign language]], and he gave it a theoretical background in numerous publications.&lt;ref name=Safiye/&gt;  The method was originally resisted, as the German educational system generally emphasized discipline and rote learning.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;  However the method became widely used in Germany in secondary education, and in the 1990s it was further formalized and began to be used in universities as well.&lt;ref name=Safiye&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Safiye |first1=Aslan, |title=Is Learning by Teaching Effective in Gaining 21st Century Skills? The Views of Pre-Service Science Teachers. |journal=Educational Sciences: Theory and Practice |date=October 5, 2015 |volume=15 |issue=6 |url=https://eric.ed.gov/?q=EJ1101263 |language=en |issn=1303-0485}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2008 Martin had retired, and although he remained active [[Joachim Grzega]] took the lead in developing and promulgating LdL.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;&lt;ref name=JPMabout&gt;{{cite web |title=About me |url=https://jeanpol.wordpress.com/about-me/ |publisher=Jean-Pol Martins Weblog |accessdate=10 June 2018 |language=de-DE |date=11 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
[[File:Learning by teaching phases.png|thumb|left|LDL, modeled on the structure of the brain by Martin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kahl |first1=von Reinhard |title=Treibhäuser der Zukunft wie in Deutschland Schulen gelingen ; eine Dokumentation |date=2005 |publisher=Archiv der Zukunft [u.a.] |location=Berlin |isbn=3-407-85830-2 |edition= 2nd, überarb. Aufl.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
After preparation by the teacher, students become responsible for their own learning and teaching. The new material is divided into small units and student groups of not more than three people are formed.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;

Students are then encouraged to experiment to find ways to teach the material to the others. Along with ensuring that students learn the material, another goal of the method, is to teach students [[life skills]] like respect for other people, planning, problem solving, taking chances in public, and communication skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Thimm |first1=Katja |title="Guten Morgen, liebe Zahlen" |url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-23011324.html |work=Der Spiegel |date=1 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kahl |first1=Reinhard |title=Unterricht: Schüler als Lehrer |url=https://www.zeit.de/online/2008/43/schueler-lehrer |work=Zeit |date=October 22, 2008 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stollhans |first1=S. |editor1-last=Corradini |editor1-first=E. |editor2-last=Borthwick |editor2-first=K. |editor3-last=Gallagher-Brett |editor3-first=A. |title=Employability for languages: a handbook |date=2016 |publisher=Researchpublishing.net |location=Dublin |isbn=978-1-908416-39-1 |pages=161–164 |chapter-url=https://dx.doi.org/10.14705/rpnet.2016.cbg2016.478 |chapter=Learning by teaching: developing transferable skills.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grzega |first1=Joachim |last2=Schöner |first2=Marion |title=The didactic model LdL (Lernen durch Lehren) as a way of preparing students for communication in a knowledge society |journal=Journal of Education for Teaching |date=4 July 2008 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=167–175 |doi=10.1080/02607470802212157}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The teacher remains actively involved, stepping in to further explain or provide support if the teaching-students falter or the learning-students do not seem to understand the material.&lt;ref name=GoetheHaus/&gt;

The method is distinct from [[tutoring]] in that LdL is done in class, supported by the teacher, and distinct from [[student teaching]], which is a part of [[teacher education]].&lt;ref name=Safiye/&gt;

== Plastic Platypus Learning ==
One way of learning by teaching, is the '''plastic platypus learning''' or '''platypus learning''' technique. This technique is based on evidence that show that teaching an inanimate object improves understanding and knowledge retention of a subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/05/04/learning-by-teaching-others-is-extremely-effective-a-new-study-tested-a-key-reason-why/ | title=Learning by teaching others is extremely effective – a new study tested a key reason why| date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aslan |first1=Safiye |title=Is Learning by Teaching Effective in Gaining 21st Century Skills? The Views of Pre-Service Science Teachers |journal=Educational Sciences: Theory &amp; Practice |date=2015 |volume=15 |issue=6 |doi=10.12738/estp.2016.1.0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bargh |first1=John A. |last2=Schul |first2=Yaacov |title=On the cognitive benefits of teaching. |journal=Journal of Educational Psychology |date=1980 |volume=72 |issue=5 |pages=593–604 |doi=10.1037/0022-0663.72.5.593}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The advantage of this technique is that that the learner does not need the presence of another person in order to teach the subject.

The name 'plastic platypus learning' is a paraphrase on the known [[software engineering]] technique [[rubber duck debugging]], in which a programmer can find bugs in their code without the help of others, simply by explaining what the code does, line by line, to an inanimate object - namely, a rubber duck.

[[File:Plastic platypus learning cropped.jpg|thumb|Plastic platypus learning in action]]
To increase the effectiveness of plastic platypus learning, learners are advised to do the following:

1. Prepare notes while learning the subject.

2. Prepare the lesson on the subject (as opposed to just teaching it unprepared; this section demands the most time and energy, and may be omitted in some situations).

3. Teach the subject without using the notes at all (the student knows this beforehand).
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1002/acp.3410|title = The learning benefits of teaching: A retrieval practice hypothesis| journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology| volume=32| issue=3| pages=401–410|year = 2018|last1 = Koh|first1 = Aloysius Wei Lun| last2=Lee| first2=Sze Chi| last3=Lim| first3=Stephen Wee Hun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obviously, this technique may work with any inanimate object, and not just plastic platypuses.

This program is designed for both recent graduates and individuals with experience in the private or public sector in dealing with [[natural resource]]s and the [[Environmental quality|environment]]. The program seeks students from a range of disciplines including [[biology]], [[engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[forestry]], [[geology]], [[business]], [[economics]], [[geography]], planning and [[social sciences]]. The program is recognized as an accredited [[sustainable planning]] program by the [[Canadian Institute of Planners]] and the [[Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.cip-icu.ca/web/la/en/pa/5580378D83DC444EB76DE6A461BB2E21/template.asp|title=The Canadian Institute of Planners|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=

== Degree requirements ==
The M.R.M. degree requires completion of six required courses (social science in [[natural resource management]], [[ecology]], [[ecological economics]], [[earth systems]], research methods), six elective courses, a [[field workshop]], and a [[research project]].

The aim is to increase familiarity and competence in understanding the dynamics of natural resources, the strategies and techniques of natural resource and [[environmental planning]] and management, and the biological, physical, social, economic and institutional implications of resource decisions. Students also become familiar with various quantitative methods of analysis and aids to [[decision making]]. In the field of natural resources, in particular, it is important that an academic degree provide a foundation for problem-solving as well as creative and critical thinking rather than focus primarily on subject matter such as [[fisheries]], economics, or forestry.

Graduate student research projects required to complete the degree evaluate the effectiveness of existing natural resource management policies and, where appropriate, present alternatives. Students apply a range of approaches including [[cost-benefit analysis]], [[simulation modeling]], legal and institutional assessment frameworks, and social surveys to address critical and emerging natural resource management issues on local, national, and international scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rem.sfu.ca/research/publications/|title=REM Publications|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mermaid Theatre''' was a theatre encompassing the site of [[Puddle Dock]] and [[Worshipful Company of Curriers|Curriers' Alley]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiver.rootsweb.ancestry.com/th/read/LONDON-COMPANYS/2000-08/0967625368 www.ancestry.com]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]] in the [[City of London]], and the first built in the City since the time of [[Shakespeare]]. It was, importantly, also one of the first new theatres to abandon the traditional stage layout; instead a single tier of seats surrounded the stage on three sides.

==History==
The 20th-century theatre was the life's work of actor [[Bernard Miles]] with his wife, [[Josephine Wilson]]. His original Mermaid Theatre was a large barn at his house in the [[St. John's Wood]] area of London. This seated 200 people, and during 1951 and 1952 was used for concerts, plays and a celebrated opera production of ''[[Dido and Aeneas]]'' with [[Kirsten Flagstad]], [[Maggie Teyte]] and [[Thomas Hemsley]], conducted by Geraint Jones, which was recorded by HMV. For the third season in 1953 the Mermaid Theatre was moved to the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McArthur |first=Edwin |date=1965 |title=Flagstad, A Personal Memoir |publisher=A. A. Knopf |location=New York |page=274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miles was encouraged to build a permanent theatre and, raising money from public subscriptions, and his revenues from publicity spots for the [[Egg Marketing Board]]; he oversaw the creation of the new building on land formerly occupied by a warehouse. This site was close to the location of an abortive attempt, in the [[Jacobean era]], to build a theatre (named Porter's Hall) for the amalgamation of the Children of the Queen's Revels and Lady Elizabeth's Men. This project, undertaken by [[Philip Rosseter]] with distant backing from [[Philip Henslowe|Henslowe]] and [[Edward Alleyn|Alleyn]], was ended because of complaints from the neighbourhood's residents.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The new Mermaid Theatre opened in 1959 with a successful production of ''[[Lock Up Your Daughters (musical)|Lock Up Your Daughters]]'' and it was the venue for many other very successful productions, such as ''[[Cowardy Custard]]'' (often cited{{who|date=October 2015}} as responsible for the revival of interest in [[Noël Coward]]'s works) and including an annual staging of ''[[Treasure Island]]'', with Miles reprising his role of [[Long John Silver]], which he also played in a television version. The Mermaid Theatre also ran the Molecule Club, educating children about science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=9 February 1991 |title=The life and stage of Josephine Wilson – One of the founders of the Molecule Club |first=Donald |last=Gould|work=New Scientist |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12917556-900-forum-the-life-and-stage-of-josephine-wilson-one-of-the-founders-of-the-molecule-club/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1961 the poet and author [[Sylvia Plath]] read her poem "Tulips" at the Poetry at the Mermaid Festival, sponsored by the Arts Council of Great Britain. The programme notes that there were twelve commissioned poets at the festival, one of whom was Plath's husband, [[Ted Hughes]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Other notable productions include the 1978 première of ''[[Whose Life Is It Anyway? (play)|Whose Life Is It Anyway?]]'', with [[Tom Conti]] and [[Rona Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/tv-radio-obituaries/10250854/Rona-Anderson.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Obituary: Rona Anderson | date=18 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] sometimes transferred Stratford productions to the Mermaid, including a residency during 1987 which saw the staging of seven plays.&lt;ref&gt;https://cdn2.rsc.org.uk/sitefinity/press-resources/performance-history---june-2016.pdf?sfvrsn=8&lt;/ref&gt;

Bernard Miles' tenure as honorary artistic advisor was abruptly terminated and the theatre's importance declined. In 1989 Abdul Shamji was sentenced to 15-months in prison over his involvement in the [[Johnson Matthey]] bank collapse.&lt;ref name="Offstage drama at the Mermaid"&gt;{{cite news |first= Charles|last= Neviin|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/captain-moonlight-offstage-drama-at-the-mermaid-1466921.html |title= Captain Moonlight: Offstage drama at the Mermaid|publisher=The Independent|access-date= 11 April 2018 |location=London |date= 12 December 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.truthaboutlloyds.com/fraud/myth85.html |title=Not a Myth of Hindsight: 1085 |website=Truth About Lloyds}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19891101&amp;id=jEVAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YFkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1612,32433 |title=Prison for millionaire who lied |work=Glasgow Herald |date=1 November 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josephine Wilson died in 1990 and Bernard (by then Lord) Miles died in 1991, financially destitute.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

After a further change of ownership the theatre was slated for demolition in 2002 as part of redevelopment plans. Already it had fallen into disuse, the buildings being used more often as a conference centre than a theatre. A preservation campaign by actors and other supporters attempted to reverse the decision. In April 2003 [[Ken Livingstone]], the [[Mayor of London]], ordered the council to block the demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mayor gives theatre a lifeline |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/2939777.stm |work=BBC News |date=11 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2005 new plans had been submitted for the redevelopment of the site. Nothing materialised and the building continued to operate primarily as a conference centre. The [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] used it for occasional concerts, and the BBC recorded a popular weekly radio show, ''[[Friday Night is Music Night]]'' that showcased musicians such as the violinist [[Nigel Kennedy]] and singer [[Josh Groban]]. In 2006, music duo [[Pet Shop Boys]] played a mid-length set accompanied by the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] and special guests including Robbie Williams, Francis Barber and Rufus Wainwright which was musically directed by Trevor Horn. The show was documented on the audio release entitled [[Concrete (Pet Shop Boys album)|Concrete]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Loss of theatre status, and redevelopment plans==
In September 2008 the Corporation of London City Planning Committee, against the advice of the [[Theatres Trust]] and noted actors, producers and artistic directors,&lt;ref name="Outrage" /&gt; granted a certificate that stripped the former playhouse of its theatre status. The move may save the developer £6 million worth of Section 106 funding which it had previously agreed to pay in lieu if it closed the 600-seat Mermaid; the company could be released from the obligation because no theatrical productions have taken place for more than ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/18/arts.artsnews | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=David | last=Ward | title=Manchester theatre eyes Mermaid | date=2003-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existing plans would see the Puddle Dock building converted into a conference centre and fitness suite, plus offices, a nightclub and retail and restaurant space. Campaigners were concerned that the entire building might be demolished.&lt;ref name="Outrage"&gt;{{cite web |first= Lalayn |last= Baluch |date= 30 September 2008 |url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/21927/campaigners-outraged-as-city-of-london|title=Outrage as Mermaid Theatre developer released from £6m donation deal |website= [[The Stage]] |accessdate= 11 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former chairman of the Save London's Theatres Campaign, John Levitt, called the decision “a tragedy” and “sheer meanness”.&lt;ref name="Outrage" /&gt;

In 2018 the Mermaid Theatre still exists as a conference centre called The Mermaid London.

The '''National Nuclear Laboratory''' (informally '''NNL''', formerly '''Nexia Solutions''') is a [[UK government]] owned and operated nuclear services technology provider covering the whole of the nuclear fuel cycle. It is fully customer-funded and operates at six locations in the United Kingdom. Its customers have included the [[Nuclear Decommissioning Authority]], [[Sellafield Ltd]], [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]], the [[Health and Safety Executive]], the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority|UK Atomic Energy Authority]], [[VT Group|VT Nuclear]] and [[British Energy]]. It also has extensive links with academia, including collaborative agreements on waste immobilisation and disposal with the [[University of Sheffield]] and on nuclear materials research with the [[University of Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Consortium_selected_for_UK_National_Nuclear_Laboratory-2403097.html "Consortium selected for UK National Nuclear Laboratory"], ''World Nuclear News'' (24/03/09).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The organisation began to come together in 1996 when a number of separate research and development facilities began to coalesce into a single unit within [[BNFL|British Nuclear Fuels]]. In 2003, this Research and Technology business was re-launched as Nuclear Sciences and Technology Services (NSTS) to ready the business for transformation into a fully commercial entity. In 2005, following the restructuring of the wider nuclear industry, Nexia Solutions was formed out of NSTS, as a wholly owned subsidiary of [[BNFL]].

In July 2006, the [[UK Government]] stated its intention to preserve and develop key R&amp;D capabilities potentially as part of a National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL). In October 2006, [[Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]], [[Alistair Darling]] announced the establishment of the NNL, to be based on Nexia Solutions and the British Technology Centre at [[Sellafield]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nda.gov.uk/stakeholders/newsletter/nnl-announced-sos.cfm Alistair Darling announces the formation of the National Nuclear Laboratory], ''www.nda.gov.uk'' (30/06/06).&lt;/ref&gt; The NNL was formally announced by [[John Hutton (Labour MP)|John Hutton]], [[Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform]] in an announcement at the Sellafield Visitors Centre on 23 July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_UK_national_laboratory_confirmed_2307082.html "UK national laboratory confirmed"], ''World Nuclear News'' (23 July 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 March 2009 it was announced by the [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]] (DECC) that a consortium made up of [[Serco]], [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]] and the [[University of Manchester]] had been selected as the new management contractors for the NNL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publictechnology.net/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=19457 "Consortium appointed to run UK's National Nuclear Lab to be run"], ''www.publictechnology.net ''(23/03/09).&lt;/ref&gt; The contract was for an initial three-year period with options to be extended by up to two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advfn.com/news_Serco-Battelle-To-Run-UK-National-Nuclear-Laboratory_36987885.html "Serco, Battelle To Run UK National Nuclear Laboratory"], ''www.advfn.com'' (23 March 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; DECC had been engaged in competitive dialogue with the winning consortium as well as QQEST, a joint venture between [[QinetiQ]] and [[EnergySolutions]], since October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/news/nuclear_lab/nuclear_lab.aspx "Press Release – Serco, Battelle and the University of Manchester to run National Nuclear Lab"], ''www.decc.gov.uk'' (23/03/09).&lt;/ref&gt;

The management contract commenced on 1 April 2009, when ownership of the NNL transferred from BNFL directly to DECC with shareholder responsibilities delegated to the [[Shareholder Executive]]. From day one of the new contract, the focus was on positioning the NNL as the employer of choice for nuclear scientists and engineers, and working in partnership with customers to deliver valuable [[solution]]s to the challenges faced by the national and international nuclear market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serco.com/media/pressreleases/2009/serco-battelle.asp "Serco – Battelle – University of Manchester consortium named as Recommended Bidder to run National Nuclear Laboratory"], ''www.serco.com'' (23/03/09).&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Lawrence of [[Battelle Memorial Institute|Battelle]] was appointed to lead the new NNL management team as managing director. He had more than 40 years of experience in the nuclear profession, including management of the United States Hanford Reservation and its massive site clean-up program, and his former role as the US representative on nuclear matters to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.battelle.org/spotlight/3-23-09ennl09.aspx "Battelle in consortium selected to lead England's National Nuclear Laboratory"], ''www.battelle.org'' (23/03/09).&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Lawrence retired in December 2010 and was replaced by Professor Paul Howarth, formerly NNL's Director of Science, Technology and Project Delivery.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nnl.co.uk/news/appointment-of-a-new-managing-director-for-nnl.html Appointment of a New Managing Director for NNL]&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 October 2013 the management contract expired, and the NNL became operated directly by the [[UK Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nnl.co.uk/news-media-centre/national-nuclear-laboratory-takes-next-step-in-its-evolution.aspx |title=National Nuclear Laboratory Takes Next Step in its Evolution |publisher=NNL |year=2013 |accessdate=3 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002100459/http://www.nnl.co.uk/news-media-centre/national-nuclear-laboratory-takes-next-step-in-its-evolution.aspx |archivedate=2 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''On Weights and Measures''''' is a historical, lexical, [[metrological]], and geographical treatise compiled in 392 [[Common Era|CE]] in [[Salamis, Cyprus|Constantia]] by [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] (c. 315&amp;ndash;403). The greater part of the work is devoted to a discussion on ancient Greek and Roman [[Ancient Roman units of measurement|weights and measures]].

The composition was written at the request of a Persian priest, sent to Epiphanius by letter from the Roman emperor in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;Allen A. Shaw, ''On Measures and Weights by Epiphanius'', National Mathematics Magazine 11.1 (October 1936: 3–7).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 11 (note 3). The letter was apparently signed jointly by [[Valentinian II]], emperor of the West, and [[Theodosius I|Theodosius]], emperor of the East, as well as Theodosius' two sons, [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although five fragments of an early Greek version are known to exist, with one entitled περὶ μέτρων καὶ στάθμων (''On Weights &amp; Measures''), added by a later hand,&lt;ref&gt;The Codex Parisinus Graecus 835, as noted by J.E. Dean (ed.), in ''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures: The Syriac Version'', (Chicago 1935), Introduction p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; this [[Syriac language|Syriac]] version is the only complete copy that has survived. Partial translations in Armenian and Georgian&lt;ref&gt;Found in the “Shatberd codex” MS. 1141, in the library of the ''Obshchestvo rasprostranenifa gramotnosti sredi gruzin'', Tiflis&lt;/ref&gt; are also known to exist. Its modern title belies its content, as the work also contains important historical anecdotes about people and places not written about elsewhere.

Two manuscripts of ''On Weights and Measures'', written in Syriac on parchment, are preserved at the [[British Museum]] in [[London]]. The older was found in [[Egypt]] and, according to the colophon, was written in the [[Seleucid era]], in "nine-hundred and sixty-[...]" (with the last digit effaced, meaning, that it was written between the years 649 CE–659 CE). The younger manuscript is designated "Or. Add. 14620".&lt;ref&gt;William Wright, [http://www.trismegistos.org/tm/detail.php?tm=115426 ''Catalogue of Syriac manuscripts in the British Museum''] 2 756 (pp. 717–718)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first to attempt a modern publication of Epiphanius' work was [[Paul de Lagarde]] in 1880, who reconstructed the original Syriac text by exchanging it with Hebrew characters,&lt;ref&gt;Paul de Lagarde, ''Veteris Testamenti ab Origene recensiti fragmenta apud Syros servata quinque. Praemittitur Epiphanii de mensuris et ponderibus liber nunc primum integer et ipse syriacus'', Gootingae 1880&lt;/ref&gt; and who had earlier published excerpts from several of the Greek fragments treating on weights and measures in his ''Symmicta''.&lt;ref&gt;Paul de Largarde, ''Symmicta'' I, Göttingen 1877, pp. 210–225&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, a critical edition of the Greek text was published by E.D. Moutsoulas in ''Theologia''.&lt;ref&gt;E.D. Moutsoulas, ed., "Epiphanius of Salamis, Concerning Weights and Measures" (Introduction, Commentary, Text and Notes), ''Theologia'', 44 (1973), pp. 157&amp;ndash;198&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Synopsis==
::&lt;small&gt;'''Part One'''&lt;/small&gt;
In folios [54b–55c], [[Hadrian]]'s journey and arrival in the East is dated "47 years after the destruction of Jerusalem."
*Translations
In folios [47a–49a]; [51d–52a]; [56d–57b] Epiphanius names four major translations of the [[Hebrew Bible]], made in the Greek tongue: the [[Septuagint|LXX]] made by the seventy-two translators, another by [[Aquila of Pontus]], one by [[Theodotion]], and yet another by [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]]. A fifth Greek translation was discovered in wine jars in [[Jericho]], and a sixth in [[Nicopolis]] near Actium. Afterwards, [[Origen]] arranged six columns of the extant Greek translations and two of the Hebrew side by side, naming it the [[Hexapla]].&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, pp. 33&amp;ndash;34, 36&lt;/ref&gt; Epiphanius expands his description of the translation of the seventy-two translators (known as the Septuagint) and how they were assigned thirty-six cells, two to each cell, on the Pharian island. Two translators translated the [[Book of Genesis]], another two the [[Book of Exodus]], another two the [[Book of Leviticus]], and so forth, until the entire 22 canonical books of the Hebrew Bible had all been translated into the Greek tongue.&lt;ref&gt;Excluding [[Ecclesiastes]] and the [[Song of Solomon]], which books had only later been added to the canon, according to Jewish tradition.&lt;/ref&gt; The seventy-two translators were drawn from the twelve tribes of Israel, six men to each tribe who were skilled in the Greek language.
 
In folios [49a–50a] Epiphanius gives a description of the canonical books of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and translations made of the same. In his day, he notes that the Scroll of Ruth and the Book of Judges were joined together, and considered as one book. So, too, the [[Book of Ezra|Books of Ezra]] and [[Book of Nehemiah|Nehemiah]] were joined, and considered as one book, as were First and Second [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] (''Paraleipomena'') considered as one book, as were the First and Second [[Book of Samuel|Samuel]] (''Book of First and Second Kingdoms'') considered as one book, and the First and Second [[Books of Kings|Kings]] (''Book of Third and Fourth Kingdoms'') considered as one book.&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;small&gt;'''Part Two'''&lt;/small&gt;
*Prominent figures
In spite of Epiphanius' interest in Jewish themes, his narrative often takes on a distorted and stereotypical view of [[Judaism]], based on the dogmas of his persuasion. Still, he is an invaluable source on the lives of people and places that figure highly in Jewish [[Oral tradition|lore]]. In folios [54a–55c]; [55c–55d] Epiphanius treats on the lives of two prominent persons who became [[proselytes]] to the Jewish religion; the one [[Aquila of Pontus|Aquila]] (known also as Onkelos) who was a relation of [[Hadrian]], and whom he made the overseer of Jerusalem's rebuilding around 115 [[Common Era|CE]].&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; The other person of interest who is described by him is [[Symmachus (translator)|Symmachus]], also known as ''Sūmkos'' ({{lang-he-n|'''סומכוס'''}}) in rabbinic literature.&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Mishnah]] ''Eruvin'' 3:1; ''Baba Metzia'' 6:5; ''Ḥullin'' 5:3 in ''The Mishnah'' (ed. Herbert Danby), Oxford University Press, 1974; the [[Babylonian Talmud]] ''Eruvin'' 13b, ''Baba Bathra'' 73a, ''Baba Kamma'' 46a, ''et al''.&lt;/ref&gt; Symmachus is mentioned as belonging originally to the [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] nation, and is said to have converted to Judaism during the reign of [[Marcus Aurelius|Verus]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Epiphanius, Marcus Aurelius was also called Verus.&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently underwent a second [[circumcision]]&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; and became a disciple of [[Rabbi Meir]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]] ''Eruvin'' 13b&lt;/ref&gt; Symmachus belonged to the fifth generation (165&amp;ndash;200 [[Common Era|CE]]) of Rabbinical teachers referred to in the text of the [[Mishnah]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Mishnah'' (ed. [[Herbert Danby]]), Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, Appendix III, pp. 799&amp;ndash;800 {{ISBN|0 19 815402 X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor [[Hadrian]] is said to have passed through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] while ''en route'' to Egypt, some 47 years after the destruction of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;'''Part Three'''&lt;/small&gt;
*Weights and Measures
Folios [61d–73b] contain a treatise on the known weights and measures used in his day among the [[Jews|Hebrews]], the Greeks and the Romans. He states the equivalent weights for the ''[[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement#Dry measure|kab]]'' (''cab''),&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; ''kor'',&lt;ref&gt;A measure of capacity equal to 30 ''modii'' (seahs). v. ''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 12 (folio 45d). The same is defined in the Talmud (''Baba Bathra'' 86b, 105a) as equal to thirty ''seahs'', a capacity equal to about 395.533 cubic centimeters.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''lethekh'' ([[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement#Dry measure|Lethek]]), [[Homer (unit)|''homer'']], [[Bath (unit)|''bath'']], ''modius'' ([[Hebrew]]: ''seah'' = lit. "measure"),&lt;ref&gt;A measure of capacity equivalent to the volume of 144 medium-sized eggs (9.6 litres); Marcus Jastrow, ''Dictionary of the Targumim, the Talmud Babli and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature'' (2nd edition), Massachusetts 2006, s.v. '''מודיא''' p. 738.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Mina (unit)|mina]]'' ([[Hebrew]]: ''maneh''),&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, pp. 60 (§ 51), 65; a weight in silver that was equal to 100 ''[[denarii|denaria]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; among others. In folios [62b–62c] Epiphanius distinguishes between "a handful" ({{Lang-he-n|'''מְלֹא כַף'''}}) in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09a17.htm#12 I Kings 17:12] and "a handful" ({{Lang-he-n|'''מְלֹא חֹפֶן'''}}) in [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0209.htm#8 Exodus 9:8] and [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0316.htm#12 Leviticus 16:12]; in the former case it refers to only one handful, but in latter cases it refers to "a measure of two handfuls."&lt;ref&gt;''Epiphanius' Treatise on Weights and Measures - The Syriac Version'' (ed. James Elmer Dean), University of Chicago Press 1935, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;small&gt;'''Part Four'''&lt;/small&gt;
*Geography of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Levant]]
In folios [73b–75a] Epiphanius gives the names of several cities and places of renown, both in his time and in ancient times, such as: [[Mount Ararat]] (§ 61), Aṭaṭ (§ 62), or what is known as the "threshing floor of the thorn bush" ({{Lang-he-n|'''גרן האטד'''}}), and whose description echoes that of [[Rashi]]'s commentary on Genesis 50:10,&lt;ref&gt;Said to be a place about two miles from the Jordan River, called ''Beth-ḥagla'' (lit. "the place of the circuit").&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abarim]] (§ 63); [[Eben-Ezer|Aviʿazar]] (§ 68), or what is ''Eḇen haʿezer'' of [[I Samuel]] 4:1, said to be "fourteen [Roman] miles distant east and north of [[Eleutheropolis]], in a valley"; [[Carmel (biblical settlement)|Carmel]]{{nbsp}}(§ 77); [[Mount Carmel|Carmel]] of the sea (§ 78); [[Akko]] (§ 76);  [[Anathoth]] (§ 66); [[Azekah]] (§ 64) - a city in whose time was called Ḥ&lt;sup&gt;ǝ&lt;/sup&gt;warta;&lt;ref&gt;R. Steven Notley &amp; [[Ze'ev Safrai]], in their book, "Eusebius, ''Onomasticon - The Place Names of Divine Scripture'' (Brill: Leiden 2005, p. 19, note 47), have noted: "According to his (Epiphanius') formulation, it would seem that he was of the opinion that Hiwarta, which means 'white' (''lavan''), is the translation of Azekah. About five kilometers to the southeast of Tell Zechariah is a high hill called Tell el-Beida, meaning in Arabic 'white'. In current maps, the site is named Tell Livnin, which means the hill of bricks (''livanim''), and it is to this that Eusebius (who also wrote about Azekah) most probably referred. 'Azekah' is not 'white', either in Hebrew or in Aramaic. ''Le-azek'' in Hebrew means to remove stones, and then the soil appears a bit paler. It therefore appears that Epiphanius, who was born in Beit Zedek, near [[Eleutheropolis]], identified Azekah with Tell el-Beida. Azekah is six kilometers from Eleutheropolis, and Tell Livnin is eight kilometers from there. Epiphanius adapted the new name to the identification by means of an etymological exegesis that has no linguistic basis. At any rate, no settlement existed on Tell Azekah in the Roman-Byzantine period. The early site moved from the high hill to the fields in the plain at the foot of the tell. It may possibly have moved as fr as Kh. el-Beida, although this is difficult to accept."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bethel]] (§ 73); [[Ophrah (Taybeh)|Ophrah]] (§ 67); [[Carthage]] (§ 79) - where the [[Canaanites]] had migrated from [[Phoenicia]] and who were called in his day ''Bizakanoi'' (scattered people); [[Petra|Rekem]] (§ 71), [[Jaffa]] (§ 75), [[Jerusalem]]{{nbsp}}(§ 74), ''et al.''

The regnal years of the Caesars as stated by Epiphanius differ slightly in some places from the extant Greek versions. With respect to events in Rome after the reign of [[Pertinax]], both Epiphanius and [[Jerome]] do not mention the ascension of [[Didius Julianus]] after the assassination of Pertinax, but write only that [[Septimius Severus|Severus]] succeeded him.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' of [[Jerome]], [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_03_part2.htm 2005 online edition]  (tertullian.org), year 193. Epiphanius, by his own admittance (''On Weights and Measures'', p. 66 [folio 71c]), was familiar with [[Eusebius]]' ''Chronicle'' from which Jerome had based his ''Chronicon'' and may have used it to construct his own chronologies.&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been because they did not consider his 9-week reign, which he obtained through usurpation, to be legitimate. Similarly, Epiphanius does not mention the ascension of [[Aemilian]]. It can be adduced from Jerome's ''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' that Aemilian, who "caused a revolt in Moesia," was never officially confirmed by the Senate in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Chronicon (Jerome)|Chronicon]]'' of [[Jerome]], [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_03_part2.htm 2005 online edition]  (tertullian.org), year 254&lt;/ref&gt; Epiphanius' method of recording the regnal years from Augustus to Hadrian, with his pinpoint recollection of the number of months and days to each reign, can be said to be accurate, based on [[Josephus]]' own testimony about himself, saying that he was aged 56  in the 13th year of the reign of Caesar [[Domitian]],&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' (20.11.3)&lt;/ref&gt; and that he (Josephus) was born in the 1st year of Caesar [[Caligula|Gaius]].&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, ''[[The Life of Flavius Josephus|Vita]]'' § 1&lt;/ref&gt; Using Epiphanius' chronology, the years are indeed collected as 56. By comparison, the span of years in [[Suetonius]]' ''De vita Caesarum'' (Lives of the Caesars), which gives 14 years for Claudius and 15 years for Nero, the same time frame would span a period of some 58 years!&lt;ref&gt;Suetonius, ''Lives of the Caesars'' (the Loeb Classical Library series), vol. ii, book v, paragraph xlv&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''College of Liberal Arts''' (CLA) is the second largest of the 11 colleges at [[Oregon State University]] and offers 23 undergraduate degrees, 12 master's degrees and five doctoral degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/academics|title=OSU, College of Liberal Arts, Academics|last1=University|first1=Oregon State|date=|website=oregonstate.edu|publisher=OSU|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CLA coursework is offered at the university's main campus in [[Corvallis, Oregon]] and at the [[OSU-Cascades]] campus in [[Bend, Oregon]]. Currently, the CLA employs 290 faculty members with an enrollment of just over 3,600 full-time undergraduates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=University|first1=Oregon State|title=Oregon State Enrollmenent Fall Term 2015 |url=http://oregonstate.edu/admin/aa/ir/sites/default/files/enroll-fall-2015.pdf|website=OregonState.edu|publisher=Oregon State University|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The most popular CLA majors include psychology, economics, sociology, digital communications arts, anthropology, liberal studies, political science, history and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oregon State University|first1=OSU|title=Oregon State University, Enrollment, Fall 2015|url=http://oregonstate.edu/admin/aa/ir/sites/default/files/enroll-fall-2015.pdf |website=oregonstate.edu |publisher=OSU |accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Oregon State University]] first offered studies in liberal arts in 1868. According to the CLA website, however, students showed greater interest sciences and technology through much of the early 1900s. The trend forced administrators to de-emphasize liberal arts as a major.

By World War II, courses in liberal arts grew in popularity and OSU President A.L. Strand created the first divisional majors in humanities and social sciences at the university in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=OSU|first1=Oregon State University|title=About|url=http://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/about|website=liberalarts.oregonstate.edu|publisher=OSU|accessdate=11 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university later added the [[School of Humanities]] and [[Social Sciences]] in 1961 and continued to expand liberal arts studies throughout the 1960s. In 1973, the school became formalized as the College of Liberal Arts (CLA). Early departments included the Humanities, Social Sciences and the Fine and Performing Arts.

The first graduate degrees were offered by the college in scientific and technical communications in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Dictionary of University Histories|title=Oregon State University|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tntEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA325&amp;lpg=PA325&amp;dq=oregon+state+university+college+of+liberal+arts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hd0Il93oMc&amp;sig=mDyRKtYytHU9SHMWafwAtzrH41Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiOtfWMxazLAhVO2mMKHfopCto4ZBDoAQgcMAA#v=onepage&amp;q=oregon%20state%20university%20college%20of%20liberal%20arts&amp;f=false|website=books.google.com/|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|accessdate=6 March 2016|ref=Pg 322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number and taxonomy of paraphilia is under debate; one source lists as many as 549 types of paraphilia.&lt;ref name="aggrawal"&gt;{{cite book | first=Anil | last=Aggrawal | title=Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices | publisher=[[CRC Press]] | location=Boca Raton | year=2009| isbn=978-1-4200-4308-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[DSM-5]] has specific listings for eight paraphilic disorders.&lt;ref name="DSM-5, intro"&gt;{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders | edition = Fifth | chapter = Paraphilic Disorders | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | pages = 685–686}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several sub-classifications of the paraphilias have been proposed, and some argue that a fully dimensional, spectrum or complaint-oriented approach would better reflect the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Maser | first = JD | year = 2002 | url = http://download.journals.elsevierhealth.com/pdfs/journals/0193-953X/PIIS0193953X02000345.pdf | title = Spectrum concepts in major mental disorders | journal = Psychiatric Clinics of North America| volume = 25 | issue = 4 | pages = xi–xiii |name-list-format=vanc| author2 = Akiskal HS | display-authors = 1 | pmid = 12462854 | doi=10.1016/S0193-953X(02)00034-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krueger RF, Watson D, Barlow DH | title = Introduction to the Special Section: Toward a Dimensionally Based Taxonomy of Psychopathology | journal = Journal of Abnormal Psychology | volume = 114 | issue = 4 | pages = 491–3 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16351372 | pmc = 2242426 | doi = 10.1037/0021-843X.114.4.491 | url = http://content.apa.org/journals/abn/114/4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Many terms have been used to describe atypical sexual interests, and there remains debate regarding technical accuracy and perceptions of stigma. [[Sexologist]] [[John Money]] popularized the term ''paraphilia'' as a non-[[pejorative]] designation for [[Kink (sexual)|unusual sexual interests]].&lt;ref name="wiederman2003"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weiderman |first=M. |year=2003 |title=Paraphilia and Fetishism |journal=The Family Journal |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=315–321 |doi=10.1177/1066480703252663 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bullough1995"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bullough | first = VL | year = 1995 | url = http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/LIBRO.HTM | title = Science in the Bedroom: A History of Sex Research | page = 281 | publisher = [[Basic Books]] | isbn = 978-0-465-07259-0 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061022080700/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/LIBRO.HTM | archivedate = 22 October 2006 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moser2001"&gt;{{cite book | last = Moser | first = C | year = 2001 | chapter = Critiques of conventional models of sex therapy | editor = Kleinplatz PJ | title = New directions in sex therapy: innovations and alternatives | publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis|Psychology Press]] | isbn =  978-0-87630-967-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mccammon2004"&gt;{{cite book | last = McCammon | first = S |author2=Knox D |author3=Schacht C | year = 2004 | title = Choices in sexuality | page = 476 | publisher = Atomic Dog Publishing | isbn =  978-1-59260-050-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Money described paraphilia as "a sexuoerotic embellishment of, or alternative to the official, ideological norm."&lt;ref name="money1990"&gt;{{cite book | last = Money | first = J | authorlink = John Money | year = 1990 | title = Gay, Straight, and In-Between: The Sexology of Erotic Orientation | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn = 978-0-19-506331-8 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=nCvBoIr4eTYC&amp;pg=PA139#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 139]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrist [[Glen Gabbard]] writes that despite efforts by Stekel and Money, "the term ''paraphilia'' remains pejorative in most circumstances."&lt;ref name="gabbard2007"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gabbard | first = GO | year = 2007| title = Gabbard's Treatments of Psychiatric Disorders| publisher = American Psychiatric Press | isbn = 978-1-58562-216-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coinage of the term ''paraphilia'' (''paraphilie'') has been credited to [[Friedrich Salomon Krauss]] in 1903, and it entered the English language in 1913, in reference to Krauss by urologist [[William J. Robinson]].&lt;ref name="janssen"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Janssen|first=D.F.|year=2014|title=How to "Ascertain" Paraphilia? An Etymological Hint|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=43|issue=7|pages=1245–1246|doi=10.1007/s10508-013-0251-5|pmid=24464548}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was used with some regularity by [[Wilhelm Stekel]] in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="stekel"&gt;{{cite book| last = Stekel | first = W | authorlink = Wilhelm Stekel | year = 1930 | title = Sexual Aberrations: The Phenomenon of Fetishism in Relation to Sex | edition = translated from the 1922 original German | translator = S. Parker | publisher = Liveright Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] παρά (''para'') "beside" and  φιλία (''[[-phil-|-philia]]'') "friendship, [[love]]".

In the late 19th century, psychologists and psychiatrists started to categorize various paraphilias as they wanted a more descriptive system than the legal and religious constructs of [[sodomy]]&lt;ref name="dailey1989 "&gt;Dailey, Dennis M. (1989). ''The Sexually Unusual: Guide to Understanding and Helping.'' Haworth Press {{ISBN|978-0-86656-786-2}}, pp. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt; and [[perversion]].&lt;ref name="purcell2006"&gt;{{cite book | last = Purcell | first = CE |author2=Arrigo BA | year = 2006 | title = The psychology of lust murder: paraphilia, sexual killing, and serial homicide | publisher = [[Academic Press]] | isbn = 978-0-12-370510-5 | page = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the introduction of the term ''paraphilia'' in the DSM-III (1980), the term ''sexual deviation'' was used to refer to paraphilias in the first two editions of the manual.&lt;ref&gt;Laws and, O'Donohue (2008) p. 384&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, an article published in ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' described paraphilia as "recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors generally involving:&lt;ref name="AJP"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spitzer | first1 = R.

===Homosexuality and non-heterosexuality===
[[Homosexuality]], now widely considered a normal variant of human sexuality, was at one time discussed as a sexual deviation.&lt;ref name="hutchinson"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hutchinson | first = GE | year = 1959 | title = A speculative consideration of certain possible forms of sexual selection in man | journal = [[American Naturalist]] | volume = 93 | issue = 869 | pages = 81–91 | doi = 10.1086/282059 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud]] and subsequent [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] thinkers considered homosexuality and paraphilias to result from [[Psychosexual development|psychosexual]] non-normative relations to the [[Oedipal complex]].&lt;ref name="Lacan, Jacques. Le Séminaire. Livre IV. La relation d'objet, 19566-57. Ed. Jacques-Alain Miller. Paris: Seuil, 1991. p. 201"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Karpman | first1 = B. | title = The sexual psychopath | journal = Journal of the American Medical Association | volume = 146 | issue = 8 | pages = 721–726 | year = 1951 | pmid = 14832048 | doi=10.1001/jama.1951.03670080029008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the term ''sexual perversion'' or the [[epithet]] ''pervert'' have historically referred to [[gay]] men, as well as other [[non-heterosexual]]s (people who fall out of the perceived norms of sexual orientation).&lt;ref name="hutchinson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacan, Jacques. Le Séminaire. Livre IV. La relation d'objet, 19566-57. Ed. Jacques-Alain Miller. Paris: Seuil, 1991. p. 201"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kafka1996"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kafka | first = MP | year = 1996 | title = Therapy for Sexual Impulsivity: The Paraphilias and Paraphilia-Related Disorders | journal = Psychiatric Times | volume = 13 | issue = 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Cantor2012&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cantor | author-link = James Cantor | first1 = J. M. | title = Is Homosexuality a Paraphilia? The Evidence for and Against | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 237–247 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22282324 | pmc = 3310132 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-012-9900-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-20th century, mental health practitioners began formalizing "deviant sexuality" classifications into categories. Originally coded as 000-x63, homosexuality was the top of the classification list (Code 302.0) until the [[American Psychiatric Association]] removed homosexuality from the DSM in 1974. [[Martin Kafka]] writes, "Sexual disorders once considered paraphilias (e.g., homosexuality) are now regarded as variants of normal sexuality."&lt;ref name="kafka1996"/&gt;

A 2012 literature study by clinical psychologist [[James Cantor]], when comparing homosexuality with paraphilias, found that both share "the features of onset and course (both homosexuality and paraphilia being life-long), but they appear to differ on sex ratio, [[fraternal birth order effect|fraternal birth order]], [[handedness]], [[IQ]] and cognitive profile, and neuroanatomy". The research then concluded that the data seemed to suggest paraphilias and homosexuality as two distinct categories, but regarded the conclusion as "quite tentative" given the current limited understanding of paraphilias.&lt;ref name = Cantor2012/&gt;

==Causes==
The causes of paraphilic sexual preferences in people are unclear, although a growing body of research points to a possible prenatal neurodevelopmental correlation. A 2008 study analyzing the sexual fantasies of 200 heterosexual men by using the Wilson Sex Fantasy Questionnaire exam, determined that males with a pronounced degree of fetish interest had a greater number of older brothers, a high 2D:4D [[digit ratio]] (which would indicate excessive prenatal estrogen exposure), and an elevated probability of being [[Left-handedness|left-handed]], suggesting that disturbed hemispheric [[Lateralization of brain function|brain lateralization]] may play a role in deviant attractions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rahman Q, Symeonides DJ | title = Neurodevelopmental Correlates of Paraphilic Sexual Interests in Men | journal = [[Archives of Sexual Behavior]] | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 166–172 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 18074220 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-007-9255-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Behaviorism|Behavioral]] explanations propose that paraphilias are [[Classical conditioning|conditioned]] early in life, during an experience that pairs the paraphilic stimulus with intense sexual arousal.&lt;ref name="Nolen-Hoeksema2013"&gt;{{cite book | author = Nolen-Hoeksema, Susan | year = 2013 | url = http://connect.customer.mheducation.com/products/connect-for-nolen-hoeksema-abnormal-psychology-6e/ | title = Abnormal Psychology | edition = 6th | location = Boston | publisher = McGraw-Hill | isbn = 978-0078035388 | page = 385}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susan Nolen-Hoeksema]] suggests that, once established, [[masturbatory]] fantasies about the stimulus reinforce and broaden the paraphilic arousal.&lt;ref name="Nolen-Hoeksema2013" /&gt;

==Diagnosis==
There is scientific and political controversy regarding the continued inclusion of sex-related diagnoses such as the paraphilias in the DSM, due to the stigma of being classified as a mental illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Kleinplatz | first = PJ |author2=Moser C | year = 2005 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=gcZDghztlpMC&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title = Politics versus science: An addendum and response to Drs. Spitzer and Fink | journal = Journal of Psychology and Human Sexuality | volume = 17 | issue = 3/4 | pages = 135–139 | doi = 10.1300/J056v17n03_09 | isbn = 9780789032140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups, seeking greater understanding and acceptance of [[sexual diversity]], have lobbied for changes to the legal and medical status of unusual sexual interests and practices. Charles Allen Moser, a physician and advocate for sexual minorities, has argued that the diagnoses should be eliminated from diagnostic manuals.&lt;ref name="moser2005"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Moser C, Kleinplatz PJ | year = 2005 | title = DSM-IV-TR and the Paraphilias: An argument for removal | url = | journal = Journal of Psychology and Human Sexuality | volume = 17 | issue = 3/4| pages = 91–109 | doi=10.1300/j056v17n03_05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Typical versus atypical interests===
[[Albert Eulenburg]] (1914) noted a commonality across the paraphilias, using the terminology of his time, "All the forms of sexual perversion...have one thing in common: their roots reach down into the matrix of natural and normal sex life; there they are somehow closely connected with the feelings and expressions of our physiological erotism. They are...hyperbolic intensifications, distortions, monstrous fruits of certain partial and secondary expressions of this erotism which is considered 'normal' or at least within the limits of healthy sex feeling."&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Eulenburg|Eulenburg]] (1914). ''Ueber sexualle Perversionen. Ztschr. f. Sexualwissenschaft,'' Vol. I, No. 8. translated in [[Wilhelm Stekel|Stekel, Wilhelm]]. (1940). ''Sexual aberrations: The phenomena of fetishism in relation to sex.'' New York: Liveright, p. 4. {{OCLC|795528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clinical literature contains reports of many paraphilias, only some of which receive their own entries in the diagnostic taxonomies of the [[American Psychiatric Association]] or the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psyweb.com/Mdisord/DSM_IV/jsp/Axis_I.jsp |title="Axis I. Clinical Disorders, most V-Codes and conditions that need Clinical attention". Retrieved: 23 November, 2007 |publisher=Psyweb.com |accessdate=2013-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, (2007), [http://www.who.int/classifications/apps/icd/icd10online/ Chapter V, Block F65; Disorders of sexual preference.] Retrieved 2007-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt; There is disagreement regarding which sexual interests should be deemed paraphilic disorders versus normal variants of sexual interest. For example, as of May 2000, per DSM-IV-TR, "Because some cases of Sexual Sadism may not involve harm to a victim (e.g., inflicting humiliation on a consenting partner), the wording for sexual sadism involves a hybrid of the DSM-III-R and DSM-IV wording (i.e., "the person has acted on these urges with a non-consenting person, or the urges, sexual fantasies, or behaviors cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dsmivtr.org/2-3changes.cfm Summary of Practice-Relevant Changes to the DSM-IV-TR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511220758/http://www.dsmivtr.org/2-3changes.cfm |date=11 May 2008 }} from [http://www.dsmivtr.org/ Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517004926/http://www.dsmivtr.org/ |date=17 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM-IV-TR also acknowledges that the diagnosis and classification of paraphilias across cultures or religions "is complicated by the fact that what is considered deviant in one cultural setting may be more acceptable in another setting”.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). ''Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders'' (4th ed., text rev.). Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that [[cultural relativism]] is important to consider when discussing paraphilias, because there is wide variance concerning what is sexually acceptable across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dinesh Bhugra|author2=Dmitri Popelyuk|author3=Isabel McMullen|last-author-amp=yes|title=Paraphilias Across Cultures: Contexts and Controversies|journal=Journal of Sex Research|date=2010|volume=2|issue=47|pages=242–256|doi=10.1080/00224491003699833|pmid=20358463|url=http://0-search.ebscohost.com.mercury.concordia.ca/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=48944219&amp;site=ehost-live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intensity and specificity===
Clinicians distinguish between optional, preferred and exclusive paraphilias,&lt;ref name=DSM/&gt; though the terminology is not completely standardized. An "optional" paraphilia is an alternative route to sexual arousal. In preferred paraphilias, a person prefers the paraphilia to conventional sexual activities, but also engages in conventional sexual activities.

The literature includes single-case studies of exceedingly rare and idiosyncratic paraphilias. These include an adolescent male who had a strong fetishistic interest in the exhaust pipes of cars, a young man with a similar interest in a specific type of car, and a man who had a paraphilic interest in sneezing (both his own and the sneezing of others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Psychiatry|volume=6|issue=3|date=March 2007|pages=130&amp;ndash;134|title=Sexual disorder and psychosexual therapy|author=Padmal de Silva|doi=10.1016/j.mppsy.2006.12.009|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B82Y7-4N0GJN5-6&amp;_user=10&amp;_coverDate=03%2F31%2F2007&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=0e747196d9865801e85db7b1c2942c5b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=King, M.B.|title=Sneezing as a fetish object|journal=[[Sexual and Marital Therapy]]|volume=5|year=1990|pages=69&amp;ndash;72|doi=10.1080/02674659008407999|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DSM-I and DSM-II ===
In American psychiatry, prior to the publication of the DSM-I, paraphilias were classified as cases of "psychopathic personality with pathologic sexuality". The DSM-I (1952) included [[sexual deviation]] as a [[personality disorder]] of [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopathic]] subtype. The only diagnostic guidance was that sexual deviation should have been "reserved for deviant sexuality which [was] not symptomatic of more extensive syndromes, such as schizophrenic or obsessional reactions". The specifics of the disorder were to be provided by the clinician as a "supplementary term" to the sexual deviation diagnosis; there were no restrictions in the DSM-I on what this supplementary term could be.&lt;ref&gt;Laws and, O'Donohue (2008) pp. 384-385 citing DSM-I pp. 7, 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; Researcher [[Anil Aggrawal]] writes that the now-obsolete DSM-I listed examples of supplementary terms for pathological behavior to include "homosexuality, transvestism, pedophilia, fetishism, and sexual sadism, including rape, sexual assault, mutilation."&lt;ref name="aggrawal2008"&gt;{{cite book | last = Aggrawal | first = A | year = 2008 | title = Forensic and medico-legal aspects of sexual crimes and unusual sexual practices | page = 47 | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | isbn = 978-1-4200-4308-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM-II (1968) continued to use the term ''sexual deviations'', but no longer ascribed them under personality disorders, but rather alongside them in a broad category titled "personality disorders and certain other nonpsychotic mental disorders". The types of sexual deviations listed in the DSM-II were: sexual orientation disturbance (homosexuality), fetishism, pedophilia, transvestitism (sic), exhibitionism, voyeurism, sadism, masochism, and "other sexual deviation". No definition or examples were provided for "other sexual deviation", but the general category of sexual deviation was meant to describe the sexual preference of individuals that was "directed primarily toward objects other than people of opposite sex, toward sexual acts not usually associated with [[coitus]], or toward coitus performed under bizarre circumstances, as in necrophilia, pedophilia, sexual sadism, and fetishism."&lt;ref&gt;Laws and, O'Donohue (2008) p. 385 citing DSM-II p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; Except for the removal of homosexuality from the DSM-III onwards, this definition provided a general standard that has guided specific definitions of paraphilias in subsequent DSM editions, up to DSM-IV-TR.&lt;ref name="Laws and, O'Donohue 2008 p. 386"&gt;Laws and O'Donohue (2008) p. 386&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DSM-III through DSM-IV ===
The term ''paraphilia'' was introduced in the DSM-III (1980) as a subset of the new category of "psychosexual disorders."

The DSM-III-R (1987) renamed the broad category to [[sexual disorder]]s, renamed atypical paraphilia to paraphilia NOS (not otherwise specified), renamed transvestism as [[transvestic fetishism]], added [[frotteurism]], and moved [[zoophilia]] to the NOS category. It also provided seven nonexhaustive examples of NOS paraphilias, which besides zoophilia included [[telephone scatologia]], necrophilia, [[partialism]], [[coprophilia]], [[klismaphilia]], and [[urophilia]].&lt;ref&gt;Laws and, O'Donohue (2008) p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM-IV (1994) retained the sexual disorders classification for paraphilias, but added an even broader category, "sexual and [[gender identity disorder]]s," which includes them. The DSM-IV retained the same types of paraphilias listed in DSM-III-R, including the NOS examples, but introduced some changes to the definitions of some specific types.&lt;ref name="Laws and, O'Donohue 2008 p. 386"/&gt;

===DSM-IV-TR===
The DSM-IV-TR describes paraphilias as "recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges or behaviors generally involving nonhuman objects,  the suffering or humiliation of oneself or one's partner, or children or other nonconsenting persons that occur over a period of six months" (criterion A), which "cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning" (criterion B). DSM-IV-TR names eight specific paraphilic disorders ([[exhibitionism]], [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]], [[frotteurism]], [[pedophilia]], [[Sexual masochism disorder|sexual masochism]], [[Sexual sadism disorder|sexual sadism]], [[voyeurism]], and [[transvestic fetishism]], plus a residual category, [[Paraphilia not otherwise specified|paraphilia—not otherwise specified]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/display/article/10168/55266|title=Paraphilias: Clinical and Forensic Considerations|website=psychiatrictimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criterion B differs for exhibitionism, frotteurism, and pedophilia to include acting on these urges, and for sadism, acting on these urges with a nonconsenting person.&lt;ref name = DSM&gt;American Psychiatric Association (2000). Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (4th ed., text revision). pp. 569-570, 572, 574, Washington, DC: Author.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexual arousal]] in association with objects that were designed for sexual purposes is not diagnosable.&lt;ref name = DSM/&gt;

Some paraphilias may interfere with the capacity for sexual activity with consenting adult partners.&lt;ref name = DSM/&gt;

In the current version of the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR), a paraphilia is not diagnosable as a [[psychiatric disorder]] unless it causes distress to the individual or harm to others.&lt;ref name = "DSMTR"/&gt;

=== DSM-5 ===
The [[DSM-5]] adds a distinction between ''paraphilias'' and ''paraphilic disorders'', stating that paraphilias do not require or justify psychiatric treatment in themselves, and defining ''paraphilic disorder'' as "a paraphilia that is currently causing distress or impairment to the individual or a paraphilia whose satisfaction has entailed personal harm, or risk of harm, to others".&lt;ref name="DSM-5, intro" /&gt;

The DSM-5 Paraphilias Subworkgroup reached a "consensus that paraphilias are not ''ipso facto'' psychiatric disorders", and proposed "that the DSM-V make a distinction between ''paraphilias'' and paraphilic ''disorders''. [...] One would ''ascertain'' a paraphilia (according to the nature of the urges, fantasies, or behaviors) but ''diagnose'' a paraphilic disorder (on the basis of distress and impairment). In this conception, having a paraphilia would be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for having a paraphilic disorder." The 'Rationale' page of any paraphilia in the electronic DSM-5 draft continues: "This approach leaves intact the distinction between normative and non-normative sexual behavior, which could be important to researchers, but without automatically labeling non-normative sexual behavior as psychopathological. It also eliminates certain logical absurdities in the DSM-IV-TR. In that version, for example, a man cannot be classified as a transvestite—however much he cross-dresses and however sexually exciting that is to him—unless he is unhappy about this activity or impaired by it. This change in viewpoint would be reflected in the diagnostic criteria sets by the addition of the word "Disorder" to all the paraphilias. Thus, Sexual Sadism would become [[Sexual sadism disorder|Sexual Sadism Disorder]]; Sexual Masochism would become [[Sexual masochism disorder|Sexual Masochism Disorder]], and so on."&lt;ref name=dsm5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid%3D186 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215165810/http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=186 |archivedate=15 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bioethics]] professor Alice Dreger interpreted these changes as "a subtle way of saying sexual kinks are basically okay – so okay, the sub-work group doesn’t actually bother to define paraphilia. But a paraphilic disorder is defined: that’s when an atypical sexual interest causes distress or impairment to the individual or harm to others." Interviewed by Dreger, [[Ray Blanchard]], the Chair of the Paraphilias Sub-Work Group, explained: "We tried to go as far as we could in depathologizing mild and harmless paraphilias, while recognizing that severe paraphilias that distress or impair people or cause them to do harm to others are validly regarded as disorders."&lt;ref&gt;Alice Dreger (19 Feb 2010) ''[http://www.thehastingscenter.org/of-kinks-crimes-and-kinds-the-paraphilias-proposal-for-the-dsm-5 Of Kinks, Crimes, and Kinds: The Paraphilias Proposal for the DSM-5]'', [[Hastings Center]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Allen Moser pointed out that this change is not really substantive as DSM-IV already acknowledged a difference between paraphilias and non-pathological but unusual sexual interests, a distinction that is virtually identical to what is being proposed for DSM-5, and it is a distinction that, in practice, has often been ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Moser C | year = 2010 | title = Problems with Ascertainment | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 39 | issue = 6| pages = 1225–1227 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-010-9661-9 | pmid = 20652734 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linguist]] [[Andrew Clinton Hinderliter]] argued that "Including some sexual interests—but not others—in the DSM creates a fundamental asymmetry and communicates a negative value judgment against the sexual interests included," and leaves the paraphilias in a situation similar to ego-dystonic homosexuality, which was removed from the DSM because it was realized not to be a mental disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Andrew Clinton|last=Hinderliter|authorlink=Andrew Clinton Hinderliter| year=2010|title=Defining paraphilia: excluding exclusion|journal=Open Access Journal of Forensic Psychology|volume=2|pages=241–271|url=http://web.me.com/gregdeclue/Site/Volume_2__2010_files/Hinderliter%202010.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM-5 acknowledges that many dozens of paraphilias exist, but only has specific listings for eight that are forensically important and relatively common. These are voyeuristic disorder, exhibitionistic disorder, frotteuristic disorder, sexual masochism disorder, sexual sadism disorder, pedophilic disorder, fetishistic disorder, and transvestic disorder.&lt;ref name="DSM-5, intro" /&gt; Other paraphilias can be diagnosed under the [[Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder]] or Unspecified Paraphilic Disorder listings, if accompanied by distress or impairment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders | edition = Fifth | chapter = Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder; Unspecified Paraphilic Disorder | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | page = 705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Most clinicians and researchers believe that paraphilic sexual interests cannot be altered,&lt;ref name="SetoAhmed2014"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Seto MC, Ahmed AG |title=Treatment and management of child pornography use |journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=207–214 |year=2014 |pmid=24877707 |doi=10.1016/j.psc.2014.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; although evidence is needed to support this.&lt;ref name="SetoAhmed2014" /&gt; Instead, the goal of therapy is normally to reduce the person's discomfort with their paraphilia and limit any criminal behavior.&lt;ref name="SetoAhmed2014" /&gt; Both [[psychotherapeutic]] and pharmacological methods are available to these ends.&lt;ref name="SetoAhmed2014" /&gt;

[[Cognitive behavioral therapy]], at times, can help people with paraphilias develop strategies to avoid acting on their interests.&lt;ref name="SetoAhmed2014" /&gt; Patients are taught to identify and cope with factors that make acting on their interests more likely, such as stress.&lt;ref name="SetoAhmed2014" /&gt; It is currently the only form of psychotherapy for paraphilias supported by randomized double-blind trials, as opposed to case studies and consensus of expert opinion.&lt;ref name="thibaut2010" /&gt;&lt;!-- p. 646 --&gt;

===Medications===
Pharmacological treatments can help people control their sexual behaviors, but do not change the content of the paraphilia.&lt;ref name="thibaut2010" /&gt; They are typically combined with cognitive behavioral therapy for best effect.&lt;ref name="assumpcao2014"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Assumpção AA, Garcia FD, Garcia HD, Bradford JM, Thibaut F |title=Pharmacologic treatment of paraphilias |journal=Psychiatric Clinics of North America |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=173–181 |year=2014 |pmid=24877704 |doi=10.1016/j.psc.2014.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====SSRIs====
[[Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]]s (SSRIs) are used, especially with exhibitionists, non-offending pedophiles, and compulsive masturbators. They are proposed to work by reducing sexual arousal, [[compulsivity]], and depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name="assumpcao2014" /&gt; They have been well received and are considered an important pharmacological treatment of paraphilia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kraus|first=C.|last2=Strohm|first2=K.|last3=Hill|first3=A.|last4=Habermann|first4=N.|last5=Berner|first5=W.|last6=Briken|first6=P.|date=2007-6|title=[Selective serotonine reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in the treatment of paraphilia]|journal=Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie|volume=75|issue=6|pages=351–356|doi=10.1055/s-2006-944261|issn=0720-4299|pmid=17031776}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Antiandrogens====
[[Antiandrogen]]s are used in more severe cases.&lt;ref name="assumpcao2014" /&gt; Similar to physical [[castration]], they work by reducing [[androgen]] levels, and have thus been described as [[chemical castration]].&lt;ref name="assumpcao2014" /&gt; The antiandrogen [[cyproterone acetate]] has been shown to substantially reduce sexual fantasies and offending behaviors.&lt;ref name="assumpcao2014" /&gt; [[Medroxyprogesterone acetate]] and [[gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist]]s (such as [[leuprorelin]]) have also been used to lower sex drive.&lt;ref name="assumpcao2014" /&gt; Due to the side effects, the World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry recommends that hormonal treatments only be used when there is a serious risk of sexual violence, or when other methods have failed.&lt;!-- p. 647 --&gt;&lt;ref name="thibaut2010"&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Thibaut F, De La Barra F, Gordon H, Cosyns P, Bradford JM |title=The World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry (WFSBP) guidelines for the biological treatment of paraphilias |journal=The World Journal of Biological Psychiatry|volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=604–655 |year=2010 |pmid=20459370 |doi=10.3109/15622971003671628}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgical [[castration]] has largely been abandoned because these pharmacological alternatives are similarly effective and less invasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authors = Camilleri JA, Quinsey VL |date= 2008 | title = Sexual Deviance: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment | edition = 2nd | publisher = The Guilford Press | pages = 199–200 | chapter = Pedophilia: Assessment and Treatment | veditors = Laws DR, O'Donohue WT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Research has shown that paraphilias are rarely observed in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=American Psychiatric Association|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: Fourth Edition|date=1994|page=594|edition=IV|id= {{ASIN|0890420629|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DSM-V"&gt;{{Citation | last = American Psychiatric Association| first = | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: Fifth Edition | journal = | date = 2013| pages = 685–706 | edition = 5th| id =  {{ASIN|0890425558|country=uk}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been some studies on females with paraphilias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eva W. C. Chow|author2=Alberto L. Choy|last-author-amp=yes|title=Clinical Characteristics and Treatment Response to SSRI in a Female Pedophile|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=April 2002|volume=31|issue=2|pages=211–215|accessdate=14 March 2015|doi=10.1023/A:1014795321404|url=http://0-download.springer.com.mercury.concordia.ca/static/pdf/886/art%253A10.1023%252FA%253A1014795321404.pdf?auth66=1425842757_14e2bfac5512359c2fbdb237bd2d809b&amp;ext=.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual masochism has been found to be the most commonly observed paraphilia in women, with approximately 1 in 20 cases of sexual masochism being female.&lt;ref name=DSM/&gt;&lt;ref name="DSM-V" /&gt;

Many acknowledge the scarcity of research on female paraphilias.&lt;ref name="Hunsley"&gt;{{Citation| first = John| last = Hunsley | title = A Guide to Assessments That Work | place = New York | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| series = | volume = | edition = | year = 2008| pages = 496–497 | doi = | isbn = 978-0-19-531064-1 | mr =  | zbl =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of paraphilia studies are conducted on people who have been convicted of [[Sex and the law|sex crimes]].&lt;ref name="Duncan"&gt;{{Citation | first = Karen A. | last = Duncan | title = Female Sexual Predators: Understanding Them to Protect Our Children and Youths | place = Santa Barbara | publisher = [[Praeger Publishing|Praeger]] | year = 2010| isbn = 978-0-313-36629-1 | zbl =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the number of male convicted sex offenders far exceeds the number of female convicted sex offenders, research on paraphilic behavior in women is consequently lacking.&lt;ref name="Duncan" /&gt; Some researchers argue that an underrepresentation exists concerning pedophilia in females.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lisa J. Cohen, PhD|author2=((Igor Galynker, MD, PhD))|author2-link=Igor Galynker|last-author-amp=yes|title=Psychopathology and Personality Traits of Pedophiles |publisher=''[[Psychiatric Times]]'' |date= 8 June 2009|accessdate=14 March 2015|url=http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/articles/psychopathology-and-personality-traits-pedophiles}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the low number of women in studies on pedophilia, most studies are based from "exclusively male samples".&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt; This likely underrepresentation may also be attributable to a "societal tendency to dismiss the negative impact of sexual relationships between young boys and adult women".&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; [[Michele Elliott]] has done extensive research on child sexual abuse committed by females, publishing the book ''Female Sexual Abuse of Children: The Last Taboo'' in an attempt to challenge the gender-biased discourse surrounding sex crimes.&lt;ref name="Elliott"&gt;{{Citation | first = Michele | last = Elliott | title = Female Sexual Abuse of Children: The Last Taboo | place = New York | publisher = Guilford Publications, Inc. | series =  | volume =  | edition =  | year = 1994 | page = | doi =  | isbn = 9780898620047| mr =  | zbl =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Hunsley states that physiological limitations in the study of [[female sexuality]] must also be acknowledged when considering research on paraphilias. He states that while a man's sexual arousal can be directly measured from his erection (see [[penile plethysmograph]]), a woman's sexual arousal cannot be measured as clearly (see [[vaginal photoplethysmograph]]), and therefore research concerning female sexuality is rarely as conclusive as research on men.&lt;ref name="Hunsley" /&gt;

==Legal issues==
In the United States, following a series of landmark cases in the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], persons diagnosed with paraphilias, particularly pedophilia (''[[Kansas v. Hendricks]]'', 1997) and exhibitionism (''[[Kansas v. Crane]]'', 2002), with a history of [[anti-social behavior]] and related criminal history, can be held indefinitely in [[civil confinement]] under various state legislation generically known as [[sexually violent predator laws]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = First | first1 = M.

{{History of printing}}
{{Marketing}}
'''Printing''' is a process for reproducing text and [[Printmaking|images]] using a master form or template. The earliest non-paper products involving printing  include [[cylinder seal]]s and objects such as the [[Cyrus Cylinder]] and the [[Cylinders of Nabonidus]]. The earliest known form of printing as applied to paper was [[woodblock printing]], which appeared in China before 220 A.D.&lt;ref name="cave"&gt;Shelagh Vainker in Anne Farrer (ed), "Caves of the Thousand Buddhas", 1990, British Museum publications, {{ISBN|0-7141-1447-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later developments in printing technology include the [[movable type]] invented by [[Bi Sheng]] around 1040 AD&lt;ref name="Great Chinese Inventions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.minnesota-china.com/Education/emSciTech/inventions.htm |title=Great Chinese Inventions |publisher=Minnesota-china.com |accessdate=July 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203213025/http://www.minnesota-china.com/education/emSciTech/inventions.htm |archivedate=December 3, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[printing press]] invented by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in the 15th century.

==History==
{{Main|History of printing}}

===Woodblock printing===
{{Main|Woodblock printing}}
[[Woodblock printing]] is a technique for printing text, images or patterns that was used widely throughout East Asia. It originated in China in antiquity as a method of printing on [[textiles]] and later on paper. As a method of printing on cloth, the earliest surviving examples from China date to before 220 A.D.

====In East Asia====
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|left|The intricate frontispiece of the [[Diamond Sutra]] from [[Tang dynasty|Tang-dynasty]] China, 868 A.D. ([[British Library]])]]
{{Main|History of printing in East Asia}}

The earliest surviving woodblock printed fragments are from China. They are of silk printed with flowers in three colours from the Han Dynasty (before 220 A.D.). They are the earliest example of woodblock printing on paper appeared in the mid-seventh century in China.

By the ninth century, printing on paper had taken off, and the first extant complete printed book containing its date is the [[Diamond Sutra]] ([[British Library]]) of 868.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/diamondsutra.html |title=Oneline Gallery: Sacred Texts |publisher=British Library |accessdate=March 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110093610/http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/sacredtexts/diamondsutra.html |archivedate=November 10, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By the tenth century, 400,000 copies of some sutras and pictures were printed, and the Confucian classics were in print. A skilled printer could print up to 2,000 double-page sheets per day.&lt;ref name=Needham&gt;
{{cite book |last1=Tsuen-Hsuin |first1=Tsien |authorlink1=Tsien Tsuen-Hsuin |last2=Needham |first2=Joseph |authorlink2=Joseph Needham |title=Paper and Printing |series=Science and Civilisation in China |volume=5 part 1 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=158, 201 |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Printing spread early to [[Korea]] and Japan, which also used Chinese [[logogram]]s, but the technique was also used in [[Turpan]] and [[Vietnam]] using a number of other scripts. This technique then spread to Persia and Russia.&lt;ref name=Carter&gt;[[Thomas Franklin Carter]], ''The Invention of Printing in China and its Spread Westward'', The Ronald Press, NY 2nd ed. 1955, pp. 176–178&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was transmitted to Europe via the Islamic world, and by around 1400 was being used on paper for [[old master print]]s and [[playing card]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mayor |first=A Hyatt |title=Prints and People |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |location=Princeton |volume=5-18 |isbn=0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Arabs never used this to print the [[Quran]] because of the limits imposed by Islamic doctrine.&lt;ref name=Carter /&gt;

====In the Middle East====
Block printing, called ''tarsh'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], developed in [[History of Arab Egypt|Arabic Egypt]] during the ninth and tenth centuries, mostly for prayers and [[amulet]]s. There is some evidence to suggest that these print blocks made from non-wood materials, possibly [[tin]], lead, or clay. The techniques employed are uncertain, however, and they appear to have had very little influence outside of the [[Muslim world]]. Though Europe adopted woodblock printing from the Muslim world, initially for fabric, the technique of metal block printing remained unknown in Europe. Block printing later went out of use in Islamic Central Asia after movable type printing was introduced from China.&lt;ref&gt;Richard W. Bulliet (1987), "[http://www.ghazali.org/articles/jaos107-3-1987-rwb.pdf Medieval Arabic Tarsh: A Forgotten Chapter in the History of Printing]". ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'' '''107''' (3), p. 427-438.&lt;/ref&gt;

====In Europe====
[[File:Saint Christopher 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The earliest known [[woodcut]], 1423, [[Buxheim]], with hand-colouring]]
Block printing first came to Europe as a method for printing on cloth, where it was common by 1300. Images printed on cloth for religious purposes could be quite large and elaborate. When paper became relatively easily available, around 1400, the medium transferred very quickly to small [[woodcut]] religious images and [[playing card]]s printed on paper. These [[old master print|prints]] produced in very large numbers from about 1425 onward.&lt;!-- This may be supported by the reference - An Introduction to a History of Woodcut, Arthur M. Hind, Houghton Mifflin Co. 1935 (in USA), reprinted Dover Publications, 1963 {{ISBN|0-486-20952-0}} (recovered from a previous version of this article) --&gt;

Around the mid-fifteenth-century, ''block-books'', woodcut books with both text and images, usually carved in the same block, emerged as a cheaper alternative to manuscripts and books printed with [[movable type]]. These were all short heavily illustrated works, the bestsellers of the day, repeated in many different block-book versions: the [[Ars moriendi]] and the [[Biblia pauperum]] were the most common.  There is still some controversy among scholars as to whether their introduction preceded or, the majority view, followed the introduction of [[movable type]], with the range of estimated dates being between about 1440 and 1460.&lt;ref&gt;Master E.S., Alan Shestack, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movable-type printing===

{{Main|Movable type}}
{{See also|History of Western typography}}

'''Movable type''' is the system of printing and [[typography]] using movable pieces of metal type, made by casting from [[matrix (printing)|matrices]] struck by [[punchcutting|letterpunches]]. [[Movable type]] allowed for much more flexible processes than hand copying or block printing.

Around 1040, the first known movable type system was created in China by [[Bi Sheng]] out of [[porcelain]].&lt;ref name="Great Chinese Inventions"/&gt; Bi Sheng used clay type, which broke easily, but [[Wang Zhen (official)|Wang Zhen]] by 1298 had carved a more durable type from wood. He also developed a complex system of revolving tables and number-association with written Chinese characters that made typesetting and printing more efficient. Still, the main method in use there remained woodblock printing (xylography), which "proved to be cheaper and more efficient for printing Chinese, with its thousands of characters".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, Christopher I., ''Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present'', Princeton University Press, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-691-15034-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper movable type printing originated in China at the beginning of the 12th century. It was used in large-scale printing of paper money
issued by the Northern Song dynasty. Movable type spread to Korea during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty.

Around 1230, Koreans invented a metal type movable printing using bronze. The [[Jikji]], published in 1377, is the earliest known metal printed book. Type-casting was used, adapted from the method of casting coins. The character was cut in beech wood, which was then pressed into a soft clay to form a mould, and bronze poured into the mould, and finally the type was polished.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tsien|1985|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Korean form of metal movable type was described by the French scholar Henri-Jean Martin as "extremely similar to Gutenberg's".&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Asa and Burke, Peter (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp. 15–23, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Eastern metal movable type was spread to Europe between the late 14th century and the early 15th century.&lt;ref name="Carter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="meggs58-69"&gt;{{cite book |last=Polenz |first=Peter von. |title=Deutsche Sprachgeschichte vom Spätmittelalter bis zur Gegenwart: I.

===The printing press===
{{main|Printing press}}
Around 1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] introduced the first movable type printing system in Europe. He advanced innovations in casting type based on a matrix and [[hand mould]], adaptations to the screw-press, the use of an oil-based ink, and the creation of a softer and more absorbent paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Steinberg |first=S. H. |authorlink=S. H. Steinberg |title=Five Hundred Years of Printing |edition=3rd |year=1974 |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |location=Harmondsworth, Middlesex |isbn=0140203435}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gutenberg was the first to create his type pieces from an alloy of lead, [[tin]], [[antimony]], copper and bismuth – the same components still used today.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved November 27, 2006, from [[Encyclopædia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] – entry "printing"&lt;/ref&gt; Johannes Gutenberg started work on his [[printing press]] around 1436, in partnership with Andreas Dritzehen – whom he had previously instructed in gem-cutting – and Andreas Heilmann, the owner of a paper mill.&lt;ref name="meggs58-69" /&gt;

Compared to [[woodblock printing]], movable type page setting and printing using a press was faster and more durable. Also, the metal type pieces were sturdier and the lettering more uniform, leading to [[typography]] and [[font]]s. The high quality and relatively low price of the [[Gutenberg Bible]] (1455) established the superiority of movable type for Western languages. The printing press rapidly spread across Europe, leading up to the [[Renaissance]], and later [[Spread of the printing press|all around the world]]. 
[[File:Miklós Andor in the page-setting room of Athenaeum Printing House - cca. 1920 (1).tiff|thumb|Page-setting room - c. 1920]]
Gutenberg's innovations in movable type printing have been called the most important invention of the second millennium.&lt;ref&gt;In 1997, [[Time–Life]] magazine picked Gutenberg's invention to be the most important of the second millennium. In 1999, the A&amp;E Network voted Johannes Gutenberg "Man of the Millennium".

===Rotary printing press===
{{Main|Rotary printing press}}
The '''rotary printing press''' was invented by [[Richard March Hoe]] in 1843. It uses impressions curved around a cylinder to print on long continuous rolls of paper or other substrates. Rotary drum printing was later significantly improved by [[William Bullock (inventor)|William Bullock]].

==Conventional printing technology==
All printing process are concerned with two kinds of areas on the final output:
# Image Area (printing areas)
# Non-image Area (non-printing areas)

After the information has been prepared for production (the prepress step), each printing process has definitive means of separating the image from the non-image areas.

Conventional printing has four types of process:
# Planographics, in which the printing and non-printing areas are on the same plane surface and the difference between them is maintained chemically or by physical properties, the examples are: offset lithography, collotype, and screenless printing.
# Relief, in which the printing areas are on a plane surface and the non printing areas are below the surface, examples: flexography and letterpress.
# Intaglio, in which the non-printing areas are on a plane surface and the printing area are etched or engraved below the surface, examples: steel die engraving, gravure
# Porous, in which the printing areas are on fine mesh screens through which ink can penetrate, and the non-printing areas are a stencil over the screen to block the flow of ink in those areas, examples: screen printing, stencil duplicator.

===Letterpress===
[[File:Commercial. Le Samedi BAnQ P48S1P03551.jpg|thumb|Miehle press printing Le Samedi journal. [[Montreal]], 1939.]]
{{Main|Letterpress printing}}
'''Letterpress printing''' is a technique of [[relief printing]]. A worker composes and locks [[movable type]] into the bed of a press, [[ink]]s it, and presses paper against it to transfer the ink from the type which creates an impression on the paper.

Letterpress printing was the normal form of printing text from its invention by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] in the mid-15th century and [[Global spread of the printing press|remained in wide use for books and other uses]] until the second half of the 20th century, when [[offset printing]] was developed. More recently, letterpress printing has seen a revival in an artisanal form.

===Offset===
{{Main|Offset press}}
'''Offset printing''' is a widely used printing technique. Offset printing is where the inked image is transferred (or "offset") from a plate to a rubber blanket. An offset transfer moves the image to the printing surface. When used in combination with the [[Lithography|lithographic]] process, a process based on the repulsion of oil and water; the offset technique employs a flat (planographic) image carrier. So, the image to be printed obtains [[ink]] from ink rollers, while the non-printing area attracts a film of water, keeping the non-printing areas ink-free.

Currently, most books and newspapers are printed using the technique of offset lithography.

===Gravure===
{{Main|Rotogravure}}
'''Gravure printing''' is an [[intaglio printing]] technique, where the image being printed is made up of small depressions in the surface of the printing plate. The cells are filled with ink, and the excess is scraped off the surface with a doctor blade. Then a rubber-covered roller presses paper onto the surface of the plate and into contact with the ink in the cells. The printing cylinders are usually made from copper plated steel, which is subsequently chromed, and may be produced by diamond engraving; etching, or [[laser]] ablation.

Gravure printing is used for long, high-quality print runs such as magazines, mail-order catalogues, packaging and printing onto fabric and wallpaper. It is also used for printing postage stamps and decorative plastic laminates, such as kitchen worktops.

===Other printing techniques===
The other significant printing techniques include:

* [[Flexography]], used for packaging, labels, newspapers
* [[Dye-sublimation printer]]
* [[Inkjet]], used typically to print a small number of books or packaging, and also to print a variety of materials: from high quality papers simulating offset printing, to floor tiles. Inkjet is also used to apply mailing addresses to direct mail pieces
* [[Laser printing]] (toner printing) mainly used in offices and for transactional printing (bills, bank documents). Laser printing is commonly used by direct mail companies to create variable data letters or coupons.
*[[Pad printing]], popular for its unusual ability to print on complex three-dimensional surfaces
*[[Relief print]], mainly used for [[Mail-order catalog|catalogue]]s
*[[Screen-printing]] for a variety of applications ranging from T-shirts to floor tiles, and on uneven surfaces
*[[Intaglio (printmaking)|Intaglio]], used mainly for high value documents such as currencies.
*[[Thermal printing]], popular in the 1990s for fax printing. Used today for printing labels such as airline baggage tags and individual price labels in supermarket deli counters.

==Impact of German movable type printing press==
===Quantitative aspects===
[[File:European Output of Printed Books ca. 1450–1800.png|thumb|European output of books printed by movable type from ca. 1450 to 1800&lt;ref name="Buringh &amp; van Zanden 2009"/&gt;]]
{{Main|History of printing}}

It is estimated that following the innovation of Gutenberg's printing press, the European book output rose from a few million to around one billion copies within a span of less than four centuries.&lt;ref name="Buringh &amp; van Zanden 2009"&gt;Buringh, Eltjo; van Zanden, Jan Luiten: "Charting the 'Rise of the West': Manuscripts and Printed Books in Europe, A Long-Term Perspective from the Sixth through Eighteenth Centuries", ''The Journal of Economic History'', Vol. 69, No. 2 (2009), pp.&amp;nbsp;409–445 (417, table 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious impact===
[[Samuel Hartlib]], who was exiled in [[Great Britain|Britain]] and enthusiastic about social and cultural reforms, wrote in 1641 that "the art of printing will so spread knowledge that the common people, knowing their own rights and liberties, will not be governed by way of oppression".&lt;ref name="Briggs-Burke"&gt;Ref: Briggs, Asa and [[Peter Burke (historian)|Burke, Peter]] (2002) A Social History of the Media: from Gutenberg to the Internet, Polity, Cambridge, pp.15–23, 61–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PrintMus 038.jpg|thumb|right|Replica of the Gutenberg press at the [[International Printing Museum]] in Carson, California]]

In the Muslim world, printing, especially in Arabic scripts, was strongly opposed throughout the [[early modern period]], though sometimes printing in [[Hebrew]] or [[Armenian script]] was permitted.  Thus the first movable type printing in the [[Ottoman Empire]] was in Hebrew in 1493.&lt;ref&gt;or soon after; Naim A. Güleryüz, ''Bizans'tan 20. Yüzyıla - Türk Yahudileri'', Gözlem Gazetecilik Basın ve Yayın A.Ş., İstanbul, January 2012, p.90 {{ISBN|978-9944-994-54-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to an imperial ambassador to [[Istanbul]] in the middle of the sixteenth century, it was a sin for the [[Turkish people|Turks]] to print religious books. In 1515, Sultan [[Selim I]] issued a decree under which the practice of printing would be punishable by death. At the end of the sixteenth century, Sultan [[Murad III]] permitted the sale of non-religious printed books in [[Arabic]] characters, yet the majority were imported from [[Italy]].  [[Ibrahim Muteferrika]]
established the first press for printing in Arabic in the Ottoman Empire, against opposition from the calligraphers and parts of the [[Ulama]]. It operated until 1742, producing altogether seventeen works, all of which were concerned with non-religious, utilitarian matters.  Printing did not become common in the Islamic world until the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, William J., "İbrāhīm Müteferriḳa and Turkish Incunabula", ''[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]]'', 1968, volume 88, issue 3, page 436&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews were banned from German printing [[guild]]s; as a result Hebrew printing sprang up in [[Italy]], beginning in 1470 in Rome, then spreading to other cities including Bari, Pisa, Livorno, and Mantua. Local rulers had the authority to grant or revoke licenses to publish Hebrew books,&lt;ref name="nyt2009"&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/12/books/12hebr.html?_r=1 A Lifetime's Collection of Texts in Hebrew, at Sotheby's]", [[Edward Rothstein]], ''[[New York Times]]'', February 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and many of those printed during this period carry the words 'con licenza de superiori' (indicating their printing having been licensed by the censor) on their title pages.

It was thought that the introduction of the printing medium 'would strengthen religion and enhance the power of monarchs.'&lt;ref name="Meyrowitz41"&gt;Meyrowitz: "Mediating Communication: What Happens?" in "Questioning the Media", p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of books were of a religious nature, with the church and crown regulating the content. The consequences of printing 'wrong' material were extreme. Meyrowitz&lt;ref name="Meyrowitz41" /&gt; used the example of [[William Carter (martyr)|William Carter]] who in 1584 printed a pro-Catholic pamphlet in Protestant-dominated England. The consequence of his action was [[hanging]].

===Social impact===
Print gave a broader range of readers access to knowledge and enabled later generations to build directly on the intellectual achievements of earlier ones without the changes arising within verbal traditions. Print, according to [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Acton]] in his lecture ''On the Study of History'' (1895), gave "assurance that the work of the [[Renaissance]] would last, that what was written would be accessible to all, that such an occultation of knowledge and ideas as had depressed the [[Middle Ages]] would never recur, that not an idea would be lost".&lt;ref name="Briggs-Burke" /&gt;
[[File:Press1520.png|thumb|upright|Bookprinting in the 16th century]]
Print was instrumental in changing the nature of reading within society.

[[Elizabeth Eisenstein]] identifies two long-term effects of the invention of printing. She claims that print created a sustained and uniform reference for knowledge as well as allowing for comparison between incompatible views.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein in Briggs and Burke, 2002: p21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asa Briggs]] and [[Peter Burke (historian)|Peter Burke]] identify five kinds of reading that developed in relation to the introduction of print:
# Critical reading: due to the fact that texts finally became accessible to the general population, critical reading emerged because people were given the option to form their own opinions on texts
# Dangerous Reading: reading was seen as a dangerous pursuit because it was considered rebellious and unsociable especially in the case of women, because reading could stir up dangerous emotions such as love and that if women could read, they could read love notes
# Creative reading: printing allowed people to read texts and interpret them creatively, often in very different ways than the author intended
# Extensive Reading: print allowed for a wide range of texts to become available, thus, previous methods of intensive reading of texts from start to finish, began to change and with texts being readily available, people began reading on particular topics or chapters, allowing for much more extensive reading on a wider range of topics
# Private reading: became linked to the rise of individualism because before print, reading was often a group event, where one person would read to a group of people and with print, literacy rose as did availability of texts, thus reading became a solitary pursuit

The invention of printing also changed the occupational structure of European cities. [[Printer (publisher)|Printers]] emerged as a new group of artisans for whom literacy was essential, although the much more labour-intensive occupation of the [[scribe]] naturally declined. Proof-correcting arose as a new occupation, while a rise in the amount of [[bookselling|booksellers]] and librarians naturally followed the explosion in the numbers of books.

=== Educational Impact ===
Gutenberg's printing press had profound impacts on universities as well. Universities were influenced in their "language of scholarship, libraries, curriculum, [and] pedagogy" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Modie|first=G|date=2014|title=Gutenberg’s Effects on Universities|url=|journal=History of Education|volume=43 |issue=4|pages=17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The language of Scholarship ====
Before the invention of the printing press, most written material was in Latin. However, after the invention of printing the number of books printed expanded as well as the vernacular. Latin was not replaced completely, but remained an international language until the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== University Libraries ====
At this time, universities began establishing accompanying libraries. "Cambridge made the chaplain responsible for the library in the fifteenth century but this position was abolished in 1570 and in 1577 Cambridge established the new office of university librarian. Although, the University of Leuven did not see a need for a university library based on the idea that professor were the library. Libraries also began receiving so many books from gifts and purchases that they began to run out of room. This issue was solved, however, by a man named Merton (1589) who decided books should be stacked horizontally on shelves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Curriculum ====
The printed press changed university libraries in many ways. Professors were finally able to compare the opinions of different authors rather than being forced to look at only one or two specific authors. Textbooks themselves were also being printed in different levels of difficulty, rather than just one introductory text being made available.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Digital printing==
By 2005, [[Digital printing]] accounts for approximately 9% of the 45 trillion pages printed annually around the world.&lt;ref name="vj_ipg2-0_keynote"&gt;"[http://h20325.www2.hp.com/blogs/scaglia/archive/2007/08/30/4314.html When 2% Leads to a Major Industry Shift] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216032849/http://h20325.www2.hp.com/blogs/scaglia/archive/2007/08/30/4314.html |date=February 16, 2008 }}" Patrick Scaglia, August 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Printing at home, an office, or an engineering environment is subdivided into:
*small format (up to ledger size paper sheets), as used in business offices and libraries
*wide format (up to 3' or 914mm wide rolls of paper), as used in drafting and design establishments.

Some of the more common printing technologies are:

*[[blueprint]] – and related chemical technologies
*[[daisy wheel]] – where pre-formed characters are applied individually
*[[dot matrix printer|dot-matrix]] – which produces arbitrary patterns of dots with an array of printing studs
*[[line printer|line printing]] – where formed characters are applied to the paper by lines
*[[thermal printer|heat transfer]] – such as early fax machines or modern receipt printers that apply heat to special paper, which turns black to form the printed image
*[[inkjet]] – including bubble-jet, where ink is sprayed onto the paper to create the desired image
*[[electrophotography]] – where [[toner]] is attracted to a charged image and then developed
*[[laser printing|laser]] – a type of [[xerography]] where the charged image is written pixel by pixel using a laser
*[[solid ink]] printer – where [[cube]]s of ink are melted to make ink or liquid toner

Vendors typically stress the total cost to operate the equipment, involving complex calculations that include all cost factors involved in the operation as well as the capital equipment costs, amortization, etc. For the most part, toner systems are more economical than inkjet in the long run, even though inkjets are less expensive in the initial purchase price.

Professional [[digital printing]] (using [[toner]]) primarily uses an electrical charge to transfer toner or liquid ink to the substrate onto which it is printed. Digital print quality has steadily improved from early color and black and white copiers to sophisticated colour digital presses such as the Xerox iGen3, the Kodak Nexpress, the HP [[Indigo Digital Press]] series, and the InfoPrint 5000. The iGen3 and Nexpress use toner particles and the Indigo uses liquid ink. The InfoPrint 5000 is a full-color, continuous forms inkjet drop-on-demand printing system. All handle variable data, and rival offset in quality. Digital offset presses are also called direct imaging presses, although these presses can receive computer files and automatically turn them into print-ready plates, they cannot insert variable data.

Small press and fanzines generally use [[digital printing]]. Prior to the introduction of cheap photocopying the use of machines such as the [[spirit duplicator]], [[hectograph]], and [[mimeograph]] was common.

==3D printing==
[[3D printing]] is a form of manufacturing technology where physical objects are created from [[3D modeling|three-dimensional digital models]] using 3D printers. The objects are created by laying down or building up many thin layers of material in succession.  The technique is also known as additive manufacturing, rapid prototyping, or fabricating.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Gang run printing==
[[Gang run printing]] is a method in which multiple printing projects are placed on a common paper sheet in an effort to reduce printing costs and paper waste. Gang runs are generally used with sheet-fed printing presses and CMYK process color jobs, which require four separate plates that are hung on the plate cylinder of the press.  Printers use the term "gang run" or "gang" to describe the practice of placing many print projects on the same oversized sheet. Basically, instead of running one postcard that is 4 x 6 as an individual job the printer would place 15 different postcards on 20 x 18 sheet therefore using the same amount of press time the printer will get 15 jobs done in the roughly the same amount of time as one job.

==Printed electronics==
[[Printed electronics]] is the manufacturing of electronic devices using standard printing processes. Printed electronics technology can be produced on cheap materials such as paper or flexible film, which makes it an extremely cost-effective method of production. Since early 2010, the printable electronics industry has been gaining momentum and several large companies, including [[Bemis Company]] and [[Illinois Tool Works]] have made investments in printed electronics and industry associations including OE-A and FlexTech Alliance are contributing heavily to the advancement of the printed electronics industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Recent Announcements Show Gains Being Made by PE Industry|url=http://www.printedelectronicsnow.com/articles/2012/07/recent-announcements-show-gains-being-made-by-pe-i|publisher=Printed Electronics Now}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Printable transistors usher in 'internet of things'|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/10/21/thinfilm/|publisher=The Register|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36819">The '''"rhetoric of social intervention"''' ('''RSI''') '''model''' is a systemic [[communication theory]] of how human beings symbolically constitute, maintain, and change social systems (e.g., organizations, societies, and cultures). The RSI model was developed in the writings of communication theorist William R. Brown.&lt;ref name="Brown1978"&gt;Brown, William R. (1978). Ideology as communication process. ''Quarterly Journal of Speech,'' ''64''(2), 123-140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1982"&gt;Brown, William R. (1982). Attention and the rhetoric of social intervention. ''Quarterly Journal of Speech,'' ''68''(1), 17-27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1986"&gt;Brown, William R. (1986). Power and the rhetoric of social intervention. ''Communication Monographs,'' ''53''(2), 180-199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown2010"&gt;Brown, William R. (2010). Need and the Rhetoric of Social Intervention. Eric Document ED515280.&lt;/ref&gt; The model provides a framework for analyzing and interpreting social system change and its side effects from a communication perspective. It also suggests a methodology for acting as an intervener to encourage and/or discourage social system change.&lt;ref name="OptGring"&gt;Opt, Susan K. &amp; Gring, Mark A. (2009). ''The rhetoric of social intervention: An introduction.'' Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The model offers an alternative approach to understanding social system change by its emphasis on communication as the driver of change in contrast to models that focus on social, political, economic, and technological forces as catalysts for change.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; The RSI model is envisioned as three communication subsystems that function as starting points for interpreting or enacting social system change.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; The subsystems, known as attention, power, and need, form the RSI model framework.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; This entry describes the assumptive foundations of the RSI model. Then it discusses the attention, power, and need patterns of communication that that model identifies as points for generating social system change and continuity.

==RSI model foundations==
The beginnings of Brown's RSI model are reflected in three main documents—a book about [[Will Rogers]] that reports research on American dream ideology,&lt;ref name="Brown1970"&gt;Brown, William R. (1970). ''Imagemaker: Will Rogers and the American dream.'' Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press.&lt;/ref&gt; a book chapter that outlines how human beings strategically use symbols to create, maintain, and change symbolic realities,&lt;ref name="Brown1972"&gt;Brown, William R. (1972). Language and strategy. In J. Makay and W. Brown, ''The rhetorical dialogue: Contemporary concepts and cases.''(pp. 365-433) Dubuque, IA: Wm. C. Brown Company Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; and a journal article in which he sketches the RSI model foundations by theorizing about the process by which human beings strategically use symbols to create, maintain, and change symbolically constructed ideology.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;

===American Dream ideology===
''Imagemaker: Will Rogers and the American Dream'' was based on Brown's doctoral dissertation.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; An Oklahoman like Rogers, Brown was curious about Rogers' influence and popularity in the 1920s and 1930s. Brown researched the source of Rogers' ability to be persuasive and authoritative and concluded that it arose from Rogers' ability to embody and reflect characteristics that the U.S. public associated with the American dream.&lt;ref name="Brown1970" /&gt; The book describes American dream attributes, such as "the dream of the dignity and worth of the individual, of freedom and equality, of success, and of progress," and shows how Rogers symbolically identified with them.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, William R. (1970). ''Imagemaker: Will Rogers and the American dream.'' Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Brown acquired an in-depth understanding of American dream ideology, he later reported that the research left him wondering how social systems construct ideology.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; To address this question, Brown began reading books and articles on language, philosophy, rhetoric, and linguistics.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt;

===The naming process===
A book chapter called Language and Strategy, written for ''The Rhetorical Dialogue: Contemporary Concepts and Cases,'' reflects Brown's initial investigations into the process by which human beings symbolically constitute reality, and, by extension, ideology.&lt;ref name="Brown1972" /&gt; The chapter describes how human beings learn to categorize experience symbolically and how this symbolizing activity functions rhetorically. Brown draws his ideas for what he calls the "naming" process from scholars such as rhetorical theorist [[Kenneth Burke]], philosopher [[Susanne Langer]], psycholinguist Roger Brown, and psychologists [[Jerome Bruner]], Jacqueline Goodnow, and George Austin.&lt;ref name="Burke1966"&gt;Burke, Kenneth. (1966). ''Language as symbolic action.'' Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Langer"&gt;Langer, Susanne. (1980). Philosophy in a new key: A study in the symbolism of reason, rite, and art. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RogerBrown"&gt;Brown, Roger (1958). ''Words and things.'' New York, NY: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruner1965"&gt;Bruner, Jerome S., Goodnow, Jacqueline J., &amp; Austin, George A. (1965). ''A study of thinking.'' New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown, building on the ideas of Roger Brown,&lt;ref name="RogerBrown" /&gt; says that human beings learn to name, or to transform experience into symbols, from language tutors, such as parents, peers, educators, and the media. He argues that human beings create names by abstracting from experience and then classifying those abstractions as "same as" or "different from" other symbolic categorizations for experience.&lt;ref name="Brown1972" /&gt; Brown urges that all names are incomplete—as abstractions, they simultaneously direct attention to certain parts of experience and away from other parts of experience.&lt;ref name="Brown1972" /&gt;

Brown suggests that all names create expectancies about experience.&lt;ref name="Brown1972" /&gt; He argues that this enables human beings to use names rhetorically to clarify ambiguous experience, to suggest approach or avoidance behavior toward experience, and to unite and divide experience.&lt;ref name="Brown1972" /&gt; For example, naming a person's actions as "terrorism" clarifies the experience, suggests avoidance behavior, and divides that experience from ones named "guerilla warfare."

Brown closes the chapter by outlining what he calls the "rhetorical reasoning" process by which human beings advocate for their particular ways of naming experience. The process involves proposing a name, explaining how the name fits the experience, and then suggesting the expected response to experience based on the proposed name.&lt;ref name="Brown1972" /&gt; Brown notes that in these discussions, negotiations, agreements, and disagreements about the symbolic classification of experience, human beings create symbolic reality.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt;

===The ideology process===
In the article Ideology as Communication Process published in the ''[[Quarterly Journal of Speech]],'' Brown merges his research in ideology and symbolic categorization to propose a model to describe the rhetorical process by which human beings create, maintain, and change ideology, and by extension, social systems.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; In two later articles, Brown refers to this model as the "rhetoric of social intervention."&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; In the Ideology article, Brown argues that the communication and creation of ideology occur simultaneously and, although a specific ideology might fade, the communication process of constituting, maintaining, and changing ideology is continuous.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; The RSI model directs attention to the continuous communication process that underlies social change and continuity.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt;

Brown defines ideology as "any symbolic construction of the world in whose superordinate 'name' human beings can comprehensively order their experience and subsume their specific activities."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, William R. (1978). Ideology as communication process. ''Quarterly Journal of Speech,'' ''64''(2), 124.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, he views ideology as an ultimate symbolic categorization of all of experience that both creates and is shaped by a social system. Ideology is an overarching name that influences how social system participants make sense of their world, social hierarchy, and needs. At the same time, ideology emerges when participants symbolically constitute worldview, power, and need.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; For example, according to the RSI model, American dream ideology influences how U.S. Americans interpret their needs and roles in society, e.g., they need "freedom." The actions they take toward achieving "freedom" also create American dream ideology.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; 

Extending Roger Brown, the RSI  model holds that human beings learn ideology from language tutors.&lt;ref name="RogerBrown" /&gt; As they learn specific names for experience, they also learn the attributes and expectancies associated with the social system's symbolically constructed ideology.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; For example, the U.S. social system often identifies attributes such as individualism, freedom, equality, success, and progress with American dream ideology. American dream ideology creates the expectancy that a more perfect life can be achieved by pursuing those attributes.&lt;ref name="Brown1970" /&gt; Brown theorizes that human beings construct ideology to meet an inherent human need for an ultimate sense of order, meaning, and explanation for all of experience.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Thus, he identifies "ultimacy" as the primary attribute of ideology to distinguish it from names given to everyday experience. He writes that ideology is "that category of experience on which one is willing to bet the meaning of one's life."&lt;ref&gt;Brown, William R. (1978). Ideology as communication process. ''Quarterly Journal of Speech,'' ''64''(2), 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the RSI model, ideology arises out of the naming process.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Human beings create ideology by abstracting from and naming sensed and non-sensed experience. The model focuses on the symbolic abstraction process associated with the naming of worldview, relationships, and needs. The model refers to these three symbolic subsystems as attention, power, and need. Brown proposes that the subsystems are holistically interconnected, so that change in one brings about simultaneous change in the other two.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Hence, the RSI model provides a systemic, or what Brown later calls an "holographic," approach to understanding social system change.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt;

According to the RSI model, bPecause ideology, like all names for experience, is abstractive, all ideologies are incomplete.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Brown theorizes that human beings adhere to an ideology as long as it seems to make comprehensive sense of experience. The model predicts that because ideology is always incomplete, adherents will encounter anomalies—experiences that violate or do not fit ideological expectancies. Human beings have an inherent need to avoid a sense of chaos or uncertainty, so they must find a way to account for or make sense of the anomalies to maintain a sense of order and meaning in life.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Thus, Brown argues that the symbolic process by which human beings create and maintain ideology is paradoxically the same process that enables them to account rhetorically for the anomalies. He concludes that rhetorical interventions to address anomalies drive social system change.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; 

The RSI model directs attention to the rhetorical process by which human beings deal with anomalies by focusing on communication patterns associated with the symbolic construction of attention, power, and need. Brown views each of these symbolic subsystems as a starting point for analyzing and initiating communication interventions to promote and impede ideological and, by extension, social system change.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;

==Attention interventions==
The Ideology article refers to the attention subsystem as "input-switching."&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Two later articles call the subsystem "attention."&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; In the RSI model, as human beings symbolically construct ideology, they create complex naming patterns to make sense of and interpret experience. They symbolically constitute templates or worldviews that give meaning to daily experience.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; They create these complex naming patterns (e.g., a good education will lead to a better life) by abstracting, or paying attention to some aspects of experience (foregrounding) and directing attention away from other aspects (backgrounding).&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; Attention interventions occur when human beings attempt to account for anomalies in their complex naming patterns by communicatively shifting attention. Brown concludes that these rhetorical shifts in attention drive social system change.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt;

In the Attention and the Rhetoric of Social Intervention article, Brown describes in detail the attention intervention aspect of the RSI model.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt; The RSI model holds that complex naming patterns create expectancies about experience (e.g., that getting a good education will make life better). But when lived experience fails to match the symbolically created expectancy (e.g., a person with a good education cannot find a job), the model suggests that human beings may become more attentive to anomalies in their naming pattern. Furthermore, the more widely human beings apply their naming patterns, the more likely they will encounter anomalies because all naming patterns are abstractions, or incomplete.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt; Because human beings are assumed to have an inherent need for order and to make sense of experience, the model predicts that human beings will attempt to compensate symbolically for these anomalies.

In the model, human beings communicatively promote or impede "attention switches" to compensate for anomalies so as to maintain meaning and order in their lives.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt; Attention switching involves a symbolic recategorizing of experience or a renaming of the expectancies associated with a symbolic category.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; Attention switching occurs when human beings rhetorically shift what they attend to in experience.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt; For example, instead of foregrounding education as the means to making a better life, they might shift to foregrounding spiritual development as the means to achieve a better life. Alternatively human beings could redefine "good education" as meaning only private education instead of all education. In both cases, the RSI model would say that human beings shifted attention to make sense of the anomaly in the "good education" template.

According to the RSI model, the conditions for an attention switch exist when there are two or more complex naming patterns that can make sense of experience and a systemic shift occurs from one template to another.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt; Attention interventions involve cycles of increased and decreased communication related to anomalies. In the cycle, (1) human beings communicatively increase attention to deviance between symbolically created expectancies and lived experience (anomalies), (2) they increasingly advocate alternative ways of knowing, being, and valuing to account for the anomalies, and (3) their openness to these alternative complex names to regain a sense of order and meaning increases.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; In the Attention article, Brown demonstrates RSI model concepts by examining the symbolic creation of the scientific worldview. He also applies the RSI model to identify attention switch cycles that generated social system shifts in U.S. black/white relationships from 1919-1965.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt;

The RSI model suggests that to promote an attention switch, interveners (persons attempting to bring about or prevent social change) communicatively feature attention to anomalies in currently held complex names. They advocate an alternative template that foregrounds aspects of experience that had been backgrounded in the currently held complex name. Their symbols mask attention to anomalies in the proposed naming pattern. Interveners that are attempting to prevent social system change communicatively feature attention to anomalies in the proposed template and mask attention to anomalies in the currently held naming pattern.

During an attention switch, experience itself is assumed not to change. What changes is how human beings symbolically categorize the experience.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt; Although experience does not change, the RSI  model suggests that it appears different because of concurrent shifts in interpretations of power and need.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; The shift to a new worldview brings about corresponding shifts in symbolic categorizations of needs and power relationships as well as an alternative social system future.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt;

The RSI model predicts that after human beings shift attention to a new naming pattern, they eventually will also encounter anomalies in that pattern itself because all naming patterns are incomplete. The cycle of attention switching will begin again.&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt; Thus, although the content of a naming pattern may change, the communication process of creating, maintaining and changing naming patterns is continuous.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;

In the RSI model, the attention subsystem is one starting point for the rhetorical analysis of or the intervention in social system change. Alternatively, social change can also be examined from the starting point of the symbolic construction of power.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;

==Power interventions==
The Ideology article refers to the power subsystem as "interpersonal categorizing."&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Two later articles call the subsystem "power."&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; In the RSI model, human beings are interdependent with others in the symbolic construction and sharing of needs and power.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; The model holds that social systems arise out of the naming of relationships. Human beings interpersonally categorize to create and reify roles, social hierarchy, and relationship rules. In creating social order, human beings also create ideology. At the same time, ideology influences the social system participants' assumptions about social hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; Power interventions occur when human beings attempt to account for anomalies in symbolically created hierarchy. These rhetorical interventions drive social system change and continuity.

In the Power and the Rhetoric of Social Intervention article, Brown describes in detail the power intervention aspect of the RSI model.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; Brown defines power as the degree to which human beings feel interdependent with others in fulfilling needs and in choosing futures.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; In the RSI model, human beings form power-sharing social systems in which they share responsibility for meeting needs and making choices that shape the social system's future.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; The RSI model treats power as a communication medium that provides rules or power codes for taking actions and/or making decisions without deliberation.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; Brown posits that relational names communicate what sociologist [[Niklas Luhmann]] calls "power codes" that shape relationship participants' choices and behaviors.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Luhmann"&gt;Luhmann, Niklas. (1979). ''Trust and power.'' Chichester, England: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the relational name "teacher/student," students typically choose to follow the teacher's direction, such as doing homework, because of social system expectancies associated with that relationship. At the same time, teachers usually follow the social system's expected rules for behavior, such as treating all students fairly.

According to the model, human beings create power through communication by symbolically constituting relationships.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; They create relationships by naming people as "same as" or "different from" each other and acting as if those similarities and differences are real and have meaning. As human beings learn relational names from language tutors, they learn expectancies the social system associates with those names.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; Thus, in the model, relational names are non-sensed or symbolic abstractions, which human beings make real in how they behave toward others and in objects created to represent relational names.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; For example, the stripes on a person's shirt and the social expectation that this person will salute officers make real the symbolic category "sergeant."&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; 

The RSI model holds that social hierarchy arises out of naming relationships "same" and "different." In the model, relational names that emphasize similarities between self and other are called "complementary" (e.g., friends, coworkers). These names convey the expectancy of equality.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; Relational names that emphasize differences are called "reciprocal" (e.g., winner/loser, coach/player). These names convey the expectancy of inequality.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; Social hierarchy is composed of complementary and reciprocal relationships. The social hierarchy becomes a symbolic reality when human beings act as if these relationships are real and that their expectancies have power.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt;

According to the model, when expectancies associated with relational names are violated, conditions for a power intervention exist.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; For example, if the teacher does not treat students fairly, the students might attempt a power intervention by complaining to the teacher's superior or by dropping the class. More specifically, power interventions involve cycles of attention shifts from cooperation to maintain the current social hierarchy to competition by offering an alternative hierarchy, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; In the cycle, (1) human beings communicatively increase attention to anomalies in social hierarchy, (2) they increasingly advocate alternative ways of social organizing based on exchange, threat, or integry, and (3) they become more open to alternative social hierarchies to regain social order. Human beings attribute motives in the choice to cooperate or challenge social hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; Brown draws upon economist [[Kenneth Boulding]]'s ideas about social organizers to suggest motives that human beings attribute to relationships—exchange, threat, and integry.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boulding"&gt;Boulding, Kenneth. (1978). ''Ecodynamics: A new theory for societal evolution.''Beverly Hills, CA: Sage Publications&lt;/ref&gt; For example, human beings cooperate because they expect something in return (exchange). They cooperate because they expect a negative outcome if they do not cooperate (threat). They cooperate because of an interpretation of shared human identity (integry).&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boulding" /&gt;

Like attention interventions, power interventions occur in communication interactions. The RSI model suggests that to encourage a power shift, interveners communicatively create social disorder by foregrounding anomalies in the current social hierarchy template. They advocate alternative ways of social organizing as the means to regain social order.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; To prevent a power shift and maintain the current social hierarchy, interveners communicatively foreground anomalies in the proposed template. They advocate ways to account for the anomalies in the current template. They attempt to dissuade openness to alternative ways of social organizing.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; In both cases, Brown concludes that communication drives social system change and continuity.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;

Because social hierarchy is a symbolic abstraction, it will always be incomplete and imperfect.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; As human beings shift from one social hierarchy to another, the newly adopted hierarchy will one day appear non-needs meeting. Thus, in the model, a continuous cycle of power shifts occur from cooperation to competition and vice versa in the symbolic creation of power.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; In the Power article, Brown traces social hierarchy shifts in black/white relationships from the 1910s to the 1970s through the lens of the RSI model. He also examines the power intervention strategies, tactics, and maneuvers of New York urban planner [[Robert Moses]] to demonstrate RSI model concepts.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt;

The RSI model predicts that shifts in the symbolic categorization of power also result in need and attention shifts. Attention shifts occur as human beings pay attention to different aspects of experience to promote or prevent power shifts.&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; Need interventions occur as shifts in power result in changes in interpretations of needs. As with the attention subsystem, the model views the power subsystem as one entry point for analyzing and intervening in social system change.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Alternatively, social system change can be examined from the perspective of the need subsystem.

==Need interventions==
The Ideology article refers to the need subsystem as "intrapersonal categorizing."&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Two later articles call the subsystem "need."&lt;ref name="Brown1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown1986" /&gt; In the RSI model, human beings have an innate need for a sense of order in self—to know who they are, their role in society, and who and what around them is important and meaningful.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Social systems construct ideology to satisfy that need, just as the constructed ideology shapes how social system participants interpret their needs.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Need interventions occur when human beings attempt to account for anomalies in their symbolically constructed interpretations of needs.

More specifically, the RSI model holds that human beings have two types of needs: biosocial and symbolic.&lt;ref name="Brown2010" /&gt; Biosocial needs are innate needs, necessary for growth and survival, which are expressed in communication (e.g., when a person says, "I need water" to fulfill a biological need for water). Symbolic needs are those constituted by communication (e.g., when a person says, "I need Brand X water" because advertisers have persuaded the person to interpret Brand X as better meeting the need for health than tap water).&lt;ref name="Brown2010" /&gt; In both cases, human beings create interdependencies with others to fulfill biosocial and symbolic needs. They learn from language tutors the social system's assumptions about what needs are important and how needs should be communicated and satisfied.&lt;ref name="Brown2010" /&gt;

Brown draws upon social anthropologist [[Edmund Leach]]'s idea of code-switching to explain how human beings create needs symbolically.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leach"&gt;Leach, Edmund. (1976). ''Culture and communication: The logic by which symbols are connected.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Leach writes that human beings talk and act as if non-sensed or abstract concepts exist in the physical world (e.g., marriage, prosperity, recession), having "forgotten" that they symbolically constructed these concepts. They code switch, or act as if the non-sensed is now the sensed.&lt;ref name="Leach" /&gt;

Need interventions involve cycles of increased and decreased communication to anomalies in symbolic constructions of needs.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Brown theorizes that need interventions involve cycles that alternate between attributing and denying individual- and group-oriented needs.&lt;ref name="Brown2010" /&gt; In the cycle, (1) human beings communicatively increase awareness or attention to unmet or attributed/denied needs, (2) they increase advocacy behavior toward those perceived as being able to meet the need, and (3) they become more open to those who can respond to attributed or denied need.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt;

The model predicts that once a particular need has been fulfilled, then attention to that particular need decreases, advocacy behavior decreases, and openness to others decreases.&lt;ref name="Brown2010" /&gt; At the same time, attention to "new" needs increases.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; In addition, if a need goes unmet and the human beings advocating the need continually encounter non-needs meeting responses, they might begin advocating the need in ways that the social system names as inappropriate (e.g., shifting from protests to setting buildings on fire).&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; Alternatively, the needs advocates might rename the need in a way that diminishes its urgency and shift attention to other needs.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; 

According to the model, to promote a shift in needs, an intervener communicatively increases attention to how current needs are not being met or how needs expectancies are unfulfilled. Then the intervener advocates an alternative interpretation of needs and shows how it makes better sense of experience in the attempt to increase others' openness to this needs proposal.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; To prevent a shift in needs, an intervener foregrounds anomalies in the proposed interpretation of needs. Then the intervener advocates a way to account for anomalies in the currently existing interpretation of needs to attempt to maintain the current interpretation of needs.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; In both cases, communication drives social system change and continuity.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;

Because the RSI model is systemic, the need subsystem is assumed to be interconnected with the power and attention subsystems.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Thus, as interpretations of needs change, so do interpretations of power relationships within the social system. In addition, attention shifts occur when the social system emphasizes different types of needs (individual or group)&lt;ref name="Brown2010" /&gt;

==Social system interventions==
Although Brown presents the RSI model as three subsystems, he theorizes that social system intervention is an holistic process that involves all three subsystems simultaneously.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; He explains that human beings' linear language limits their ability to talk about all three subsystems concurrently. Thus, when analyzing or enacting interventions, human beings tend to emphasize one subsystem and background the other two.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; The RSI model treats the shifts in the backgrounded subsystems as "side effects" of the primary subsystem intervention.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt;

In addition, in the RSI model, all social system interventions involve multiple interveners.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; Brown notes, though, that the linear nature of language often results in human beings acting as if one person or group is the primary intervener.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt; The RSI model suggests that all social system change attempts are influenced simultaneously by interveners communicating to promote change and interveners communicating to impede change.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt;

Brown names his model "social intervention" to emphasize his conclusion that any attempt to encourage or discourage social system change is an intervention, not control or manipulation.&lt;ref name="Brown1978" /&gt; He argues that the interconnected nature of the subsystems and the communication actions of multiple interveners mean that the outcome of any attempted system change evidences multi-causation. Thus, Brown views social intervention as a communication act that attempts to "nudge" a social system toward or away from a particular way of naming worldview, power, and needs.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt;

Overall, the RSI model is conceived of as a framework for analyzing and tracking the communication patterns that generate social system change and continuity. It also can be viewed as a methodology to guide efforts to promote and/or prevent social system change.&lt;ref name="OptGring" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Opt, Susan K. (2008).

'''Satirical ostraca''' are a category of [[Ostracon|ostraca]], (singular: an ''ostracon''), that represent the real world in unrealistic, impossible situations&amp;ndash;a [[satire]]. The common example portrayed which helped create this categorization, are [[animal]]s which take reversed roles, for example a ''vertically&amp;ndash;walking cat, with ducks on the end of [[leash]]es.'' The same role reversals can be seen on [[Satirical papyri]]. This concept is a prevalent feature in absurdist literature, such as in the works of [[Mikhail Bulgakov]].

The '''School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences''' ({{lang-fr|École des hautes études en sciences sociales}}; also known as '''EHESS''') is a [[France|French]] ''[[grandes écoles|grande école]]'' (élite higher-education establishment that operates outside the regulatory framework of the public university system) specialised in the social sciences and an associated college of [[PSL Research University|'''Université PSL''']].

Originally a department of the [[École Pratique des Hautes Études]], an institution created in 1868 with the purpose of training academic researchers, the EHESS became an independent institution in 1975. Today its research covers the fields of Economics and Finance (through the [[Paris School of Economics]]), [[Cognitive science|Cognitive Sciences]], [[Humanities]], [[Political science|Political Sciences]], [[Applied mathematics|Applied Mathematics]] and [[Statistics]], [[Development studies]], [[Sociology]], [[Anthropology]], [[History]], [[Musicology]], and [[Philosophy of social science]].

The institution is concentrated on scholarly research and some of its faculty (known as "directeurs d'études") have achieved international recognition in different areas: economics, [[Thomas Piketty]] and [[Nobel Prize]] [[Jean Tirole]]; historians such as [[Fernand Braudel]] and [[Lucien Febvre]]; anthropologists such as [[Claude Levi-Strauss]], [[Eduardo Viveiros de Castro]] and [[Marcel Mauss]], sociologists such as [[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Edgar Morin]] and [[Alain Touraine]]; philosophers such as [[Jacques Derrida]], and interdisciplinary scholars such as [[Marcel Mauss]] and [[Raymond Aron]].&lt;br&gt; As a higher education institution under the jurisdiction of the [[France|French]] [[Ministry of National Education (France)|Ministry of Education]], the EHESS trains academic researchers and professors specialised in the [[social sciences]]. It awards graduate degrees, such as the [[master of research]] and the [[doctorate]], as well as a school [[diploma]]. Some of them are awarded conjointly with nstitutions such as the [[École Normale Supérieure]], the [[École Polytechnique]], the [[École pratique des hautes études]], and some of the [[University of Paris#Successors and legacy|universities of Paris]].

The EHESS is a grande école and, as such, is not part of the mainstream university system. It evaluates students through a selection process based on the research project of the applicants. The scholars in training are free to choose their own curriculum among the large quantity of seminars offered by the school. The école has a small student-faculty ratio (830 researchers for 3000 students). Most faculty belong to other institutions, mostly within the [[CNRS]] but also other schools of [[PSL Research University|Université PSL]] such as the [[École normale supérieure|ENS]], the [[EPHE]] and the [[École des Chartes|ENC]], schools of [[Université Paris-Saclay]] such as [[Télécom Paristech]] and the [[École Nationale de la Statistique et de l'Administration Économique|ENSAE]], and some of the [[University of Paris#Successors and legacy|universities of Paris]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==History==
===École pratique des hautes études=== 
Originally part of the [[École pratique des hautes études]] (EPHE) as its ''VI Section: Sciences économiques et sociales'', the EHESS gained autonomy as an independent higher education institution on 23 January 1975. The creation of a dedicated branch for social science research within the EPHE was catalyzed by the ''[[Annales School|Annales]]'' historical school and was supported by several academic initiatives of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], dating to the 1920s. After WWII, the Rockefeller Foundation invested more funds in French institutions, seeking to encourage non-Marxist sociological studies.

The VIth section was created in 1947, and [[Lucien Febvre]] took its head. Soon after its creation (1947), the ''VI Section'', later EHESS, became one of the most influential shapers of contemporary [[historiography]], [[area studies]] and [[social sciences]] methodology, thanks to the contribution of eminent scholars such as [[Fernand Braudel]], [[Jacques Le Goff]] and [[François Furet]]. F. Braudel succeeded L. Febvre in 1956. He concentrated the various study groups at the well-known building on [[boulevard Raspail]], in part by financing from the [[Ford Foundation]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===Independent institution===
Today, the EHESS is one of France's ''Grands établissements''. It functions as a [[research]], [[higher education|teaching]], and degree-granting institution. It offers advanced students high-level programs intended to lead to research careers. Students are admitted on the relevance of their research project and undertake at the EHESS [[master's degree|master programs]] and [[doctorate|doctoral studies]]. The main areas of specialization include: [[history]], [[literary theory]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[philology]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[cognitive science]], [[demographics]], [[geography]], [[archaeology]], [[psychology]], [[law]], and [[mathematics]]. The  institution's focus is on [[interdisciplinary]] research within these fields. The EHESS has more than 80 research centers (among which are several joint research units with the [[CNRS]]) and 22 doctoral programs, 13 of which are in partnership with other French [[List of universities in France|Universities]] and ''[[Grandes écoles]]''.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===PSL Research University===
The school is a constituent college of the federal [[PSL Research University]]. Other institutions include the [[College de France]], the [[École Normale Supérieure]], the [[École pratique des hautes études]], [[Chimie ParisTech]], [[ESPCI ParisTech]], the [[École des mines]], and [[Paris Dauphine University]].

==Research==
{{Expand section|date=January 2017}}

===History ===
====Influence from the Annales School====
[[Lucien Febvre]] and [[Fernand Braudel]] were members of the [[Annales School|École des Annales]], the dominant school of historical analysis in France during the [[interwar period]]. However, this school of thought was contested by the growing importance of the social sciences and the beginning of [[structuralism]]. Under pressure from [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], in particular, they integrated new contributions from the fields of [[sociology]] and [[ethnography]] to event-based historical analysis, a concept put forward by the Annales school, to advocate for the concept of "a nearly imperceptible passage of history". They were reproached, along with the structuralists, for ignoring [[politics]] and the individual's influence over his fate during a period in which the colonial wars of liberation were taking place.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

The work of [[Braudel]], [[Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie|Le Roy Ladurie]] and other historians working under their influence greatly affected the research and official teaching of history in France beginning in the 1960s. The work of [[Jean-Marie Pesez]] renewed interest in the issue of methodology in medieval archeology and created the idea of "material culture".{{cn|date=July 2018}}

====New History====
During the 1970s, EHESS became the center of [[Nouvelle histoire|New History]] under the influence of [[Jacques Le Goff]] and [[Pierre Nora]]. During this period, a generation of ethnologists working under the ideas of [[Georges Balandier]] and [[Marc Augé]] were critical of the French colonial tradition and applied modern sociological concepts to third world countries.

===Sociology===
[[Pierre Bourdieu]], [[Luc Boltanski]], [[Alain Touraine]], [[Jean-Claude Passeron]] have all been associated with EHESS.

===Economics===
EHESS has always been a central place for economic debate in Europe. In France this debate is also enabled by the proximity of the researchers in Paris with national economic institutions: In this sense EHESS's advisors who have been drawn from economic professors have enjoyed a large media audience (a case example was [[Jean Fourastié]]). The diversity of viewpoints has been a priority, and liberal and Marxist economists have had the chance to debate in EHESS. Since the 1970s and 1980s EHESS has focused on quantitative economics, with classes led by well-known professors such as Louis-André Gérard-Varet, Jean-Jacques Laffont, François Bourguignon and Roger Guesnerie. They initiated not only the Paris School of Economics but the Toulouse School of Economics and Grequam (Aix-Marseille).

==Organisation==
{{Expand section|date=January 2017}}

===Recruitment===
More than 50% of the student body comes from countries other than France.&lt;!-- What is the proportion within the EU and outside? Within metropolitan and territorial France? --&gt;

==Domestic and foreign networks==
{{Expand section|date=January 2017}}

===Affiliations===
The school is a founding member of the [[Paris School of Economics]], [[Toulouse School of Economics]], and Aix-Marseille School of Economics, the three French leading centers in [[Quantitative Economics]].

===International partnerships===
EHESS has exchange programs with universities such as Oxford and Cambridge, Charles in the UK, Berkeley, Columbia, Michigan, and Humboldt in the United States, Lomonossov in Russia, Tokyo and Kyoto in Japan, Peking, the European Institute in Florence, etc. Also, it has many relations and exchange programs with universities in Asia and the Middle-East; it holds research centers on Asian Studies and Islamic Studies.

The terms '''signified and signifier''' are most commonly related to [[semiotics]], which is defined by [[Oxford Dictionaries Online]] as "the study of signs and symbols and their use or interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[Oxforddictionaries.com]]|title=definition of semiotics|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/semiotics?q=semiotic#semiotics__8 |accessdate= 18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], a Swiss linguist, was one of the two founders of semiotics. His book, ''[[Course in General Linguistics]]'' "is considered to be one of the most influential books published in the twentieth century".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2013, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Saussure explained that a sign was not only a sound-image but also a concept. Thus he divided the sign into two components: the signifier (or "sound-image") and the signified (or "concept").&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2012, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; For Saussure, the signified and signifier were purely psychological; they were form rather than substance. Today, following [[Louis_Hjelmslev|Hjelmslev]], the signifier is interpreted as the material form (something which can be seen, heard, touched, smelled or tasted) and the signified as the mental concept.&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, 2017, pp.14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The concept of signs has been around for a long time, having been studied by many philosophers who include [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine]], and others from the medieval period such as [[William of Ockham]]. The term "semiotics" "comes from the Greek root, seme, as in semeiotikos, an interpreter of signs".&lt;ref&gt;Cobley &amp; Jansz, 1997, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; It wasn't until the 20th century, however, that Saussure and American philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] brought the term into awareness. While both Saussure and Peirce contributed greatly to the concept of signs, it is important to note that each differed in their approach to the study, and it was Saussure who created the terms signifier and signified in order to break down what a sign was.

Succeeding these founders were numerous philosophers and linguists who defined themselves as semioticians. These semioticians have each brought their own concerns to the study of signs. [[Umberto Eco]] (1976), a distinguished Italian semiotician, came to the conclusion that "if signs can be used to tell the truth, they can also be used to lie".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2012, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt; Postmodernist social theorist [[Jean Baudrillard]] spoke of hyperreality, which referred to a copy becoming more real than reality. In other words, how the signified becomes more important than the signifier . Then French semiotician [[Roland Barthes]] used signs to explain the concept of connotation – cultural meanings attached to words – and denotation – literal or explicit meanings of words.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Without Saussure's breakdown of signs into signified and signifier, however, these semioticians would not have had anything to base their concepts on.

==About==
Today, "contemporary commentators tend to describe the signifier as the form that the sign takes and the signified as the concept to which it refers".&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, 2002, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between the signifier and signified is an arbitrary relationship. In other words, "there is no logical connection" between them.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2012, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from a symbol, which is "never wholly arbitrary".&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2012, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that both the signifier and the signified are inseparable is explained by Saussure's diagram, which shows how both components coincide to create the sign.

So the question is, how do signifiers create meaning and how do we know what that meaning is? In order to understand how the signifier and signified relate to each other, one must be able to interpret signs. "The only reason that the signifier does entail the signified is because there is a conventional relationship at play".&lt;ref&gt;Cobley &amp; Jansz, 1997, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; That is, a sign can only be understood when the relationship between the two components that make up the sign are agreed upon. Saussure argued that a sign's "meaning depends on its relation to other words within the system" (for example, to understand an individual word such as "tree", one must also understand the word "bush" and how the two relate to each other).&lt;ref&gt; Chandler, 2002, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this difference from other signs that allows the possibility of a speech community.&lt;ref&gt; Cobley &amp; Jansz, 1997, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; However we need to remember that signifiers and their significance change all the time, becoming "dated". It is in this way that we are all "practicing semioticians who pay a great deal of attention to signs… even though we may never have heard them before"&lt;ref&gt;Berger, 2012, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt; And while words are the most familiar form signs take, they stand for many things within life, such as advertisement, objects, body language, music, and so on. Therefore the use of signs, and the two components that make up a sign, can be and are – whether consciously or not – applied to everyday life.

The '''Sudbury Neutrino Observatory''' ('''SNO''') was a [[neutrino observatory]] located 2100&amp;nbsp;m underground in [[Vale Limited|Vale]]'s&lt;!--As it was known at the time--&gt; [[Creighton Mine]] in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]], Canada. The detector was designed to detect [[solar neutrino]]s through their interactions with a large tank of [[heavy water]].

The detector was turned on in May 1999, and was turned off on 28 November 2006.  The SNO collaboration was active for several years after that analyzing the data taken.

The director of the experiment, [[Arthur B. McDonald|Art McDonald]], was co-awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2015 for the experiment's contribution to the discovery of [[neutrino oscillation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/nobel-prize-physics-2015-1.3258178 |title=2015 Nobel Prize in Physics: Canadian Arthur B.

The underground laboratory has been enlarged into a permanent facility and now operates multiple experiments as [[SNOLAB]]. The SNO equipment itself is currently being refurbished for use in the [[SNO+]] experiment.

==Experimental motivation==
{{See also|Cowan-Reines neutrino experiment}}
The first measurements of the number of solar neutrinos reaching the earth were taken in the 1960s, and all experiments prior to SNO observed a third to a half fewer neutrinos than were predicted by the [[Standard Solar Model]]. As several experiments confirmed this deficit the effect became known as the [[solar neutrino problem]]. Over several decades many ideas were put forward to try to explain the effect, one of which was the hypothesis of [[neutrino oscillation]]s. All of the solar neutrino detectors prior to SNO had been sensitive primarily or exclusively to [[electron neutrino]]s and yielded little to no information on [[muon neutrino]]s and [[tau neutrino]]s.

In 1984, [[Herb Chen]] of the [[University of California at Irvine]] first pointed out the advantages of using heavy water as a detector for solar neutrinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Direct Approach to Resolve the Solar-Neutrino Problem |first=Herbert H. |last=Chen |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=55 |issue=14 |pages=1534–1536 |date=September 1984 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.1534|bibcode = 1985PhRvL..55.1534C |pmid=10031848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike previous detectors, using heavy water would make the detector sensitive to two reactions, one reaction sensitive to all neutrino flavours, the other reaction sensitive to only electron neutrino.  Thus, such detector can measure neutrino oscillations directly.  A location in Canada was attractive because [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]], which maintains large stockpiles of heavy water to support its [[CANDU reactor]] power plants, was willing to lend the necessary amount (worth {{Currency|330 million|CAD}} at market prices) at no cost.&lt;ref name=SNO2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/sno/D2O.html |title=Heavy Water |date=31 January 2006 |accessdate=2015-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Creighton Mine in Sudbury, among the deepest in the world and accordingly low in background radiation, was quickly identified as an ideal place for Chen's proposed experiment to be built,&lt;ref name=SNO2001/&gt; and the mine management was willing to make the location available for only incremental costs.&lt;ref name=ANRV2009&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://sno.phy.queensu.ca/papers/JelleyMcDonaldRobertsonAnnRev2009.pdf |title=The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory |first1=Nick |last1=Jelley |first2=Arthur B. |last2=McDonald |authorlink2=Arthur B.

The SNO collaboration held its first meeting in 1984. At the time it competed with [[TRIUMF]]'s [[KAON Factory]] proposal for federal funding, and the wide variety of universities backing SNO quickly led to it being selected for development. The official go-ahead was given in 1990.

The experiment observed the light produced by [[special relativity|relativistic]] electrons in the water created by neutrino interactions. As relativistic electrons travel through a medium, they lose energy producing a cone of blue light through the [[Cherenkov effect]], and it is this light that is directly detected.

The SNO detector target consisted of {{convert|1000|t|ST|0|lk=on}} of [[heavy water]] contained in a {{convert|6|m|ft|0|adj=mid|-radius}} [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]] vessel. The detector cavity outside the vessel was filled with normal water to provide both [[buoyancy]] for the vessel and [[radiation shield]]ing. The heavy water was viewed by approximately 9,600 [[Photomultiplier|photomultiplier tubes]] (PMTs) mounted on a [[geodesic]] sphere at a radius of about {{convert|850|cm|ft|0}}. The cavity housing the detector was the largest in the world at such a depth,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |journal=Canadian Consulting Engineer |title=Deep Sphere: The unique structural design of the Sudbury {{sic|Neutrinos|hide=y}} Observatory buried within the earth |first=Robert |last=Brewer |date=&lt;!--Would really like to know--&gt; |url=http://www.ieee.ca/millennium/neutrino/sno_deep.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; requiring a variety of high-performance [[rock bolt]]ing techniques to prevent rock bursts.

The observatory is located at the end of a {{convert|1.5|km|mi|1|adj=mid|-long}} [[Drift mining|drift]], named the "SNO drift", isolating it from other mining operations. Along the drift are a number of operations and equipment rooms, all held in a [[clean room]] setting. Most of the facility is [[Class 3000 (standard)|Class 3000]] (fewer than 3,000 particles of 1&amp;nbsp;μm or larger per 1&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of air) but the final cavity containing the detector is an even stricter [[Cleanroom|Class 100]].&lt;ref name=SNO2001&gt;

===Charged current interaction===
In the [[charged current]] interaction, a neutrino converts the [[neutron]] in a [[deuteron]] to a [[proton]]. The neutrino is absorbed in the reaction and an electron is produced. Solar neutrinos have energies smaller than the mass of [[muon]]s and [[tau lepton]]s, so only electron neutrinos can participate in this reaction. The emitted electron carries off most of the neutrino's energy, on the order of 5–15&amp;nbsp;[[MeV]], and is detectable. The proton which is produced does not have enough energy to be detected easily. The electrons produced in this reaction are emitted in all directions, but there is a slight tendency for them to point back in the direction from which the neutrino came.

===Neutral current interaction===
In the [[neutral current]] interaction, a neutrino dissociates the deuteron, breaking it into its constituent neutron and proton. The neutrino continues on with slightly less energy, and all three neutrino flavours are equally likely to participate in this interaction.  Heavy water has a small [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] for neutrons, and when neutrons capture on a deuterium nucleus a [[gamma ray]] ([[photon]]) with roughly 6&amp;nbsp;MeV of energy is produced.  The direction of the gamma ray is completely uncorrelated with the direction of the neutrino. Some of the neutrons wander past the acrylic vessel into the light water, and since light water has a very large cross section for neutron capture these neutrons are captured very quickly.  A gamma ray with roughly 2.2&amp;nbsp;MeV of energy is produced in this reaction, but because the energy of the photons are not above the detector's energy threshold (meaning above the threshold for the photomultipliers), they are not directly observable. The gamma ray collides with an electron through Compton scattering and the accelerated electron can be detected through Cherenkov radiation.

===Electron elastic scattering===
In the [[elastic scattering]] interaction, a neutrino collides with an atomic electron and imparts some of its energy to the electron. All three neutrinos can participate in this interaction through the exchange of the neutral [[Z boson]], and electron neutrinos can also participate with the exchange of a charged [[W boson]]. For this reason this interaction is dominated by electron neutrinos, and this is the channel through which the [[Super-Kamiokande]] (Super-K) detector can observe solar neutrinos. This interaction is the relativistic equivalent of [[billiards]], and for this reason the electrons produced usually point in the direction that the neutrino was travelling (away from the sun). Because this interaction takes place on atomic electrons it occurs with the same rate in both the heavy and light water.

==Experimental results and impact==

}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing the first clear evidence that [[Neutrino oscillation|neutrinos oscillate]] (i.e. that they can transmute into one another), as they travel in the sun. This oscillation in turn implies that neutrinos have non-zero masses. The total flux of all neutrino flavours measured by SNO agrees well with the theoretical prediction. Further measurements carried out by SNO have since confirmed and improved the precision of the original result.

Although Super-K had beaten SNO to the punch, having published evidence for neutrino oscillation as early as 1998, the Super-K results were not conclusive and did not specifically deal with solar neutrinos. SNO's results were the first to directly demonstrate oscillations in solar neutrinos. This was important to the [[standard solar model]].'''  '''The results of the experiment had a major impact on the field, as evidenced by the fact that two of the SNO papers have been cited over 1,500 times, and two others have been cited over 750 times.&lt;ref&gt;

==Other possible analyses==
The SNO detector would have been capable of detecting a [[supernova]] within our galaxy if one had occurred while the detector was online. As neutrinos emitted by a supernova are released earlier than the photons, it is possible to alert the astronomical community before the supernova is visible. SNO was a founding member of the [[Supernova Early Warning System]] (SNEWS) with [[Super-Kamiokande]] and the [[Large Volume Detector]]. No such supernovae have yet been detected.

The SNO experiment was also able to observe atmospheric neutrinos produced by [[cosmic ray]] interactions in the atmosphere. Due to the limited size of the SNO detector in comparison with Super-K the low cosmic ray neutrino signal is not statistically significant at neutrino energies below 1&amp;nbsp;[[GeV]].

==Participating institutions==
Large particle physics experiments require large collaborations. With approximately 100 collaborators, SNO was a rather small group compared to [[particle collider|collider experiment]]s. The participating institutions have included:

'''Sustainable gardening''' includes the more specific sustainable landscapes, sustainable landscape design, [[sustainable landscaping]], [[sustainable landscape architecture]], resulting in sustainable sites. It comprises a disparate group of [[Horticulture|horticultural]] interests that can share the aims and objectives associated with the international post-1980s [[sustainable development]] and [[sustainability]] programs developed to address the fact that humans are now using natural biophysical resources faster than they can be replenished by nature.&lt;ref name=MEA&gt;Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005).

==Historical development==
{{Main|Sustainability|Sustainable development|}}
After the establishment of [[sustainable agriculture]] in the early 1980s it was some time before the emergence of Sustainable Horticulture (as sustainable ''production'' horticulture) at the International Society of Horticultural Science's First International Symposium on Sustainability in Horticulture held at the International Horticultural Congress in Toronto in 2002. This symposium produced "conclusions ... on Sustainability in Horticulture and a Declaration for the 21st Century".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actahort.org/books/638/638_65.htm] Bertschinger, L. et al.

Many of the eco-friendly principles and ideas espoused by sustainable gardens, landscapes and sites perpetuate sustainable practices established as a reaction to resource-intensive [[industrial agriculture]]. These practices were established as movements for self-sufficiency and small-scale farming based on a holistic systems approach and ecological principles. Included here would be: [[biodynamic agriculture]], [[no-till farming]], [[agroecology]], [[Fukuoka farming]], [[forest gardening]], [[organic gardening]] and others. On a larger scale there is the more recent "whole farm planning"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.landcareonline.com/page.asp?pID=119] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219015654/http://landcareonline.com/page.asp?pID=119 |date=2009-02-19 }} ''Outline of the Whole Farm Planning philosophy and application''.

==Definition==

The sustainable sites initiative. ''Guidelines and performance benchmarks''. The sustainable sites initiative.

Using the United Nations [[Brundtland Report]]’s definition of sustainable development as a model, it defines sustainability within its own sphere of reference as:&lt;blockquote&gt; … ''design, construction, operations and maintenance practices that meet the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs'' &lt;/blockquote&gt; by attempting to: &lt;blockquote&gt;

American Society of Landscape Architects, Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center, University of Texas at Austin United States Botanic Garden. pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Principles and concepts==
Managing global biophysical cycles and ecosystem services for the benefit of humans, other organisms and future generations has now become a global human responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations. 1987.[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/42/ares42-187.htm "Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development."] General Assembly Resolution 42/187, 11 December 1987. Retrieved: 2009-03-03&lt;/ref&gt; The method of applying sustainability to gardens, landscapes and sites is still under development and varies somewhat according to the context under consideration. However, there are a number of basic and common underlying biological and operational principles and practices in the sustainable sites literature.

===Biological principles===
Sustainable management of man-made landscapes emulates the natural processes that sustain the biosphere and its ecosystems. First and foremost is the harnessing the energy of the Sun and the cycling of materials thereby minimising waste and energy use.

Running within, and dependent on, the natural economy there is the production and consumption of goods and services in the “human economy” which has now significantly altered, in a detrimental way, natural biogeochemical cycles (notable here are the [[water cycle]], [[carbon cycle]] and [[nitrogen cycle]] so sustainable practices maximise support for ecosystem services.&lt;ref name="MEA" /&gt;

====Native plants====
The use of [[native plants]] in a garden or landscape can both preserve and protect natural ecosystems, and reduce the amount of care and energy required to maintain a healthy garden or landscape. Native plants are adapted to the local climate and geology, and often require less maintenance than exotic species. Native plants also support populations of native birds, insects, and other animals that they [[coevolved]] with, thus promoting a healthy [[Community (ecology)|community]] of organisms.&lt;ref name="cornucopia" /&gt;

Plants in a garden or maintained landscape often form a [[Source-sink dynamics|source population]] from which plants can colonize new areas. Avoiding the use of [[invasive species]] helps to prevent such plants from establishing new populations. Similarly, the use of native species can provide a valuable source to help these plants colonise new areas.

Some non-native species can form an [[ecological trap]] in which native species are lured into an environment that appears attractive but is poorly suited to them.

However, in Britain research by the University of Sheffield as part of the BUGS project (Biodiversity in Urban Gardens in Sheffield) [http://www.bugs.group.shef.ac.uk] has revealed that for many invertebrates - the majority of wild animals in most gardens - it is not just native plants which can sustain them. The findings were published in popular form in Ken Thompson's book 'No Nettles Required: The truth about wildlife gardening'[https://web.archive.org/web/20100602032208/http://www.rbooks.co.uk/product.aspx?id=1905811144]. He confirms the approach which Chris Baines had promoted in 'How to Make a Wildlife Garden' [http://www.franceslincoln.co.uk/en/C/0/Book/213/How_to_Make_a_Wildlife_Garden.html].

===Operational principles===
Enhancement of ecosystem services is encouraged throughout the lifecycle of any site by providing clear design, construction, (operations), and management criteria.&lt;ref name="SS" /&gt; To be sustainable over the long term requires environmental, social and economic demands are integrated to provide intergenerational equity by providing regenerative sustainable systems. Operational guidelines will link to and supplement existing guidelines for the built environment (supplementing existing green building and landscape guidelines),&lt;ref name="SS" /&gt; the wider environment, and they will include metrics (benchmarks, audits, criteria, indexes etc.) that give some [[sustainability measurement|measure of sustainability]] (a rating system) by clarifying what is sustainable or not sustainable or, more likely, what is more or less sustainable.

====Scale====
Impacts of a site can be assessed and measured over any spatio-temporal scale or context.

====Direct and indirect environmental impact====
Impacts of a site may be ''direct'' by having direct measurable impacts on biodiversity and ecology at the site itself or ''indirect'' when impacts occur away from the site.

===Site principles===
[[File:Compost heap, Kew Gardens - geograph.org.uk - 215033.jpg|thumb|[[Compost]] heap at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]]]
The following are some site principles for sustainable gardening:&lt;ref name="SS" /&gt;
* Do no harm
* Use the [[Precautionary principle]]
* Design with nature and culture
* Use a decision-making hierarchy of preservation, conservation, and regeneration
* Provide regenerative systems as [[intergenerational equity]]
* Support a living process
* Use a system thinking approach
* Use a collaborative and ethical approach
* Maintain integrity in leadership and research
* Foster environmental stewardship

==Measuring site sustainability==
One major feature distinguishing the approach of sustainable gardens, landscapes and sites from other similar enterprises is the quantification of site sustainability by establishing performance benchmarks. Because sustainability is such a broad and inclusive concept the environmental impacts of sites can be categorised in numerous ways depending on the purpose for which the figures are required. The process can include minimising negative environmental impacts and maximising positive impacts. As currently applied the environment is usually given priority over social and economic factors which may be added in or regarded as an inevitable and integral part of the management process. A home gardener is likely to use simpler metrics than a professional landscaper or ecologist.

Three methodologies for measuring site sustainability include [[BREEAM]] developed by the BRE organisation in the UK, Leed, developed in America and the Oxford 360 degree sustainability Index used in Oxford Park and developed by the Oxford Sustainable Group in Scandinavia.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The ''Sustainable Sites Initiative''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablesites.org/ |title=Sustainable Sites Initiative |publisher=Sustainablesites.org |date= |accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; is producing recommendations for the American Landscape Industry. The standards and guidelines finally adopted will lead to a uniform national standard, which does not currently exist. Sustainable Sites is currently in the pilot program stage, and will formally introduce its first rating system by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Sites FAQs|url=http://www.sustainablesites.org/faqs/|accessdate=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Green Building Council supports the project and plans to adopt the Sustainable Sites metrics into future versions of its Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design Green Building Rating System. Sites are rated according to their impact on ecosystem services:&lt;ref name="SS" /&gt; The following ecosystem services have been identified by the study group:

'''''The Dehumanization of Art and Other Essays on Art, Culture, and Literature''''' is the first English translation of philosopher [[José Ortega y Gasset]]'s '''''La deshumanización del Arte e Ideas sobre la novela''''', published in 1925. This composition includes three more essays in addition to Ortega's original work.

The essays seek to understand and explain the relatively new movement of nonrepresentational art and defend these pioneering artists attempting to escape from the embraced realism and romanticism movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Dehumanization of Art and Other Essays on Art, Culture, and Literature| publisher=Princeton University Press| accessdate=2013-04-15| url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/1670.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dehumanization of art refers to the removal of human elements from these works, eliminating the content, but keeping the form. In his work, Ortega explains how the untrained eye, which is used to seeing only content in traditional paintings, must find a new approach to viewing the work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= The Dehumanization of Art.Ortega y Gasset’s Visionof New Music| last=Neves| first=Maria João| journal=International Review of the Aesthetics and Sociology of Music| year=2012| pages=365–376| volume=43| issue=2| url=https://www.academia.edu/2532824/The_Dehumanization_of_Art._Ortega_y_Gassets_Vision_of_New_Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''time crystal''' or '''space-time crystal''' is a structure that repeats in [[time]], as well as in [[space]]. Normal three-dimensional  [[crystal]]s have a repeating pattern in space, but remain unchanged as time passes. Time crystals repeat themselves in time as well, leading the crystal to change from moment to moment. A time crystal never reaches [[thermal equilibrium]], as it is a type of non-equilibrium matter, a form of matter proposed in 2012, and first observed in 2017. This state of matter cannot be isolated from its environment{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}—it is an open system in [[Non-equilibrium thermodynamics|non-equilibrium]].

The idea of a time crystal was first described by [[Nobel laureate]] and [[MIT]] professor [[Frank Wilczek]] in 2012. Later work developed a more precise definition for time crystals. It was proven that they cannot exist in equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Watanabe|Oshikawa|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 2014 Krzysztof Sacha at [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krakow]] predicted the behaviour of discrete time crystals in a periodically-driven many-body system.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Sacha|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Norman Yao et al. at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] proposed a different way to create time crystals in spin systems. From there, [[Christopher Monroe]] and [[Mikhail Lukin]] independently confirmed this in their labs. Both experiments were published in [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']] in 2017.

==History==
[[File:Frank Wilczek.jpg|thumb|[[Nobel laureate]] [[Frank Wilczek]] at [[University of Paris-Saclay]]]]
The idea of a space-time crystal was first put forward by [[Frank Wilczek]], a professor at [[MIT]] and [[Nobel laureate]], in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Wilczek|2012}} and {{harvp|Shapere|Wilczek|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Xiang Zhang, a nanoengineer at [[University of California, Berkeley]], and his team proposed creating a time crystal in the form of a constantly rotating ring of charged ions.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvs|txt|last1=Li et al.|year1=2012a|year2=2012b}}, Wolchover 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Wilczek and Zhang, Patrick Bruno, a theorist at the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] in [[Grenoble]], France, published several papers in 2013 claiming to show that space-time crystals were impossible. Also later Masaki Oshikawa from the University of Tokyo showed that time crystals would be impossible at their ground state; moreover, he implied that any matter cannot exist in non-equilibrium in its ground state.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Bruno|2013a}} and {{harvp|Bruno|2013b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvp|Thomas|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent work developed more precise definitions of [[time translation symmetry]]-breaking which ultimately led to a [[No-go theorem|'no-go' proof]] that quantum time crystals in equilibrium are not possible.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Nozières|2013}}, {{harvp|Yao et al.|2017|p=1}} and {{harvp|Volovik|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Watanabe|Oshikawa|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several realizations of time crystals, which avoid the equilibrium no-go arguments, were later proposed.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Wilczek|2013b}} and {{harvp|Yoshii et al.|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Krzysztof Sacha at [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krakow]] predicted the behaviour of discrete time crystals in a periodically driven system of ultracold atoms.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Sacha|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later works&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Khemani et al.|2016}} and {{harvp|Else et al.|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested periodically driven quantum spin systems could show similar behaviour.

Norman Yao at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] studied a different model of time crystals.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Yao et al.|2017}}, {{Harvp|Richerme|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His blueprint was successfully used by two teams: a group led by [[Harvard university|Harvard]]'s [[Mikhail Lukin]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;See {{harvp|Choi et al.|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a group led by [[Christopher Monroe]] at [[University of Maryland]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;See {{harvp|Zhang et al.|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time translation symmetry==
{{main article|Time translation symmetry}}
Symmetries in nature lead directly to conservation laws, something which is precisely formulated by the [[Noether theorem]].{{sfn|Cao|2004|p=151}}

The basic idea of ''time-translation symmetry'' is that a translation in time has no effect on physical laws, i.e. that the laws of nature that apply today were the same in the past and will be the same in the future.{{sfn|Wilczek|2015|loc=chpt. 3}} This symmetry implies the [[conservation of energy]].{{sfn|Feng|Jin|2005|p=18}}

===Broken symmetry in normal crystals===
{{main article|Crystal symmetry|spontaneous symmetry breaking}}
[[Image:Phonon nu process.svg|thumb|right|250px|Figure 2. Normal process (N-process) and Umklapp process (U-process). While the N-process conserves total [[phonon]] momentum, the U-process changes phonon momentum.]] Normal crystals exhibit ''broken translation symmetry'':  they have repeated patterns in space, and are not invariant under arbitrary translations or rotations. The laws of physics are unchanged by arbitrary translations and rotations. However, if we hold fixed the atoms of a crystal, the dynamics of electrons or other particles in the crystal depends on how it moves relative to the crystal, and particles' momentum can change by interacting with the atoms of a crystal — for example in [[Umklapp process]]es.{{sfn|Sólyom|2007|p=193}} [[Quasimomentum]], however, is conserved in a perfect crystal.{{sfn|Sólyom|2007|p=191}}

===Broken symmetry in time crystals===
Time crystals seem to break ''time-translation symmetry,'' and have repeated patterns in time. Fields or particles may change their energy by interacting with a time crystal, just as they can change their momentum by interacting with a spatial crystal.

==Thermodynamics==
Time crystals do not violate the laws of thermodynamics: energy in the overall system is conserved, such a crystal does not spontaneously convert thermal energy into mechanical work, and it cannot serve as a perpetual store of work.  But it may change perpetually in a fixed pattern in time for as long as the system can be maintained. They possess "motion without energy"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/time-crystals-might-exist-after-all-and-they-could-break-the-symmetry-of-space-and-time|title=Time Crystals Might Exist After All - And They Could Break Space-Time Symmetry|last=Crew|first=Bec|work=ScienceAlert|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;—their apparent motion does not represent conventional kinetic energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-crystals-could-be-legitimate-form-perpetual-motion/|title="Time Crystals" Could Be a Legitimate Form of Perpetual Motion - Scie…|date=2017-02-02|work=archive.is|access-date=2017-09-21|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20170202101455/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-crystals-could-be-legitimate-form-perpetual-motion/|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been proven that a time crystal cannot exist in thermal equilibrium.  Recent years have seen more studies of non-equilibrium quantum fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Esposito et al.|2009}} and {{harvp|Campisi et al.|2011}} for academic review articles on non-equilibrium quantum fluctuations&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiments==
In October 2016, Christopher Monroe at the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] claimed to have created the world's first discrete time crystal. Using the idea from Yao's proposal, his team trapped a chain of [[Ytterbium-171|&lt;sup&gt;171&lt;/sup&gt;Yb&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] ([[ytterbium]]) ions in a [[Paul trap]], confined by radio frequency electromagnetic fields. One of the two [[Spin quantum number|spin states]] was selected by a pair of laser beams. The lasers were pulsed, with the shape of the pulse controlled by an [[acousto-optic modulator]], using the [[Tukey window]] to avoid too much energy at the wrong optical frequency. The [[hyperfine]] electron states in that setup, &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; |F=0, m&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 0⟩ and |F = 1, m&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 0⟩, have very close energy levels, separated by 12.642831&amp;nbsp;GHz. Ten [[Doppler cooling|Doppler-cooled]] ions were placed in a line 0.025&amp;nbsp;mm long and coupled together.

The researchers observed a subharmonic oscillation of the drive. The experiment showed "rigidity" of the time crystal, where the oscillation frequency remained unchanged even when the time crystal was perturbed, and that it gained a frequency of its own and vibrated according to it (rather than only the frequency of the drive). However, once the perturbation or frequency of vibration grew too strong, the time crystal "melted" and lost this subharmonic oscillation, and it returned to the same state as before where it moved only with the induced frequency.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Later in 2016, [[Mikhail Lukin]] at Harvard also reported the creation of a driven time crystal. His group used a [[diamond]] crystal doped with a high concentration of [[nitrogen-vacancy center]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, which have strong dipole-dipole coupling and relatively long-lived spin [[Coherence (physics)#Quantum coherence|coherence]]. This strongly-interacting dipolar spin system was driven with microwave fields, and the ensemble spin state with an optical (laser) field was determine. It was observed that the spin polarization evolved at half the frequency of the microwave drive. The oscillations persisted for over 100 cycles. This [[Subharmonic function|subharmonic]] response to the drive frequency is seen as a signature of time-crystalline order.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Whitman College''' is a [[private university|private]] [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] located in [[Walla Walla, Washington]]. Initially founded as a seminary by a territorial legislative charter in 1859, the school became a four-year degree-granting institution in 1882.&lt;ref name="whitman.edu"&gt;https://www.whitman.edu/Documents/Offices/Registrar/Catalog/Whitman%20College.pdf History of Whitman College, Retrieved May 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman College is accredited by the Northwest Association of Schools and Colleges and competes athletically in the NCAA Division III Northwest Conference.&lt;ref name="FastFacts"&gt;https://www.whitman.edu/about/fast-facts Fast Facts About Whitman College, Retrieved September 20, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  The school offers 48 majors and 33 minors in the liberal arts and sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitman.edu/academics/departments-and-programs|title=Departments and Programs|publisher=|accessdate=April 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a student-to-faculty ratio of 9:1.&lt;ref name="FastFacts"/&gt;  Whitman was the first college in the [[Pacific Northwest]] to install a [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]] chapter, and the first school in the United States to require comprehensive exams for graduation.&lt;ref name="whitman.edu"/&gt; Whitman was ranked tied for 41st in the nation in the 2017 ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' list of Best Liberal Arts Colleges.&lt;ref name="USN&amp;WR"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/whitman-college-3803 |title=National Liberal Arts Colleges Rankings |publisher=''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' |year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman's acceptance rate for 2015 was 41%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.whitman.edu/admission-and-aid/learn-more/admitted-class-profile |title=Admitted Class Profile |publisher=''Whitman College'' |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
&lt;!-- [[Image:Narcissa and Marcus Whitman.jpg|thumb|right|Marcus and Narcissa Whitman.]] --&gt;

=== Whitman Seminary ===
In 1859, soon after the United States military declared that the land east of the Cascade Mountains was open for settlement by American pioneers, [[Cushing Eells]] traveled from the [[Willamette Valley]] to Waiilatpu, near present-day [[Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]], where 12&amp;nbsp;years earlier, Christian [[missionary|missionaries]] Dr.&amp;nbsp;[[Marcus Whitman]] and [[Narcissa Whitman]], along with 12&amp;nbsp;others were killed by a group of [[Cayuse people|Cayuse]] Indians during the [[Whitman Massacre]]. While at the site, Eells became determined to establish a "monument" to his former missionary colleagues in the form of a school for pioneer boys and girls. Eells obtained a charter for Whitman Seminary, a pre-collegiate school, from the territorial legislature. From the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, he acquired the Whitman mission site. Eells soon moved to the site with his family and began working to establish Whitman Seminary.

Despite Eells's desire to locate Whitman Seminary at the Whitman mission site, local pressure and resources provided a way for the school to open in the burgeoning town of Walla Walla. In 1866, Walla Walla's wealthiest citizen, [[Baker Boyer Bank|Dorsey Baker]], donated land near his house to the east of downtown. A two-story wood-frame building was quickly erected and classes began later that year. The school's first principal, local Congregational minister Peasly B. Chamberlin, resigned within a year and Cushing Eells was called upon to serve as principal, which he did until 1869. After Eells's resignation in 1869, the school struggled—and often failed—to attract students, pay teachers, and stay open for each term.&lt;ref name="historylink.org"&gt;{{cite web|last=Paulus|first=Michael|title=Whitman College|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;File_Id=8337|date=October 19, 2007|accessdate=June 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From seminary to college ===
Whitman's trustees decided in 1882 that while their institution could not continue as a prep school, it might survive as the area's only college.  Alexander Jay Anderson, the former president of the Territorial University (now the [[University of Washington]]), came to turn the institution into a college and become its president.  After modeling the institution after New England liberal arts colleges, Anderson opened the school on September 4, 1882 ([[Marcus Whitman]]'s birthday) with an enrollment of 60 students and three senior faculty (Anderson, his wife and son).  In 1883, the school received a collegiate charter and began expanding with aid from the [[Congregational American College and Education Society]].&lt;ref name="historylink.org"/&gt;

=== Financial turmoil and new leadership ===
Despite local support for Whitman College and help from the Congregational community, financial troubles set in for the school. After losing favor with some of the school's supporters, Anderson left Whitman in 1891 to be replaced by Reverend James Francis Eaton. The continuing recession of the 1890s increased the institution's financial worries and lost Eaton his backing, leading to his resignation in 1894.&lt;ref name="historylink.org"/&gt;

Reverend [[Stephen Penrose]], an area Congregational minister and former trustee, became president of the college and brought the school back to solvency by establishing Whitman's endowment with the aid of D. K. Pearsons, a Chicago philanthropist. By popularizing [[Marcus Whitman]]'s life and accomplishments (including the suspect claim that the missionary had been pivotal in the annexation by the United States of [[Oregon Territory]]), Penrose was able to gain support and resources for the college. Under his leadership, the faculty was strengthened and the first masonry buildings, Billings Hall and the Whitman Memorial Building, were constructed.&lt;ref name="historylink.org"/&gt;

=== End of religious affiliation ===
In 1907, Penrose began a plan called "Greater Whitman" which sought to transform the college into an advanced technical and science center.  To aid fundraising, Penrose abandoned affiliation with the Congregational Church, and became unaffiliated with any denomination.  The prep school was closed and fraternities and sororities were introduced to the campus.  Ultimately, this program was unable to raise enough capital; in 1912, the plan was abandoned and Whitman College returned to being a small liberal arts institution, albeit with increased focus on co-curricular activities.&lt;ref name="historylink.org"/&gt; Penrose iterated the school's purpose "to be a small college, with a limited number of students to whom it will give the finest quality of education".&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Thomas G. ''The Triumph of Tradition: The Emergence of Whitman College, 1859–1924'' Whitman College 1993 p 424&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1920 Phi Beta Kappa installed a chapter,&lt;ref name="historylink.org"/&gt; the first for a Northwest college,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitman.edu/content/about/tradition/history-of-the-college|title=About Whitman College|publisher=|accessdate=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Whitman had its first alum [[Rhodes Scholar]].&lt;ref name="historylink.org"/&gt;

=== World War II ===
During [[World War II]], Whitman was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

== Campus ==
[[Image:Styx statue at Whitman College.jpg|thumb|200px|"Styx" (2002), by [[Deborah Butterfield]], sits on Ankeny Field.]]
[[Image:Whitman-college-quad.jpg|thumb|200px|A view toward the Quad from the steps of Penrose Library.]]

Whitman's 117&amp;nbsp; acre campus is located in downtown [[Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]].  Most of the campus is centered around a quad, which serves as the location for intramural field sports.  Around this, Ankeny Field, sits Penrose Library, Olin Hall and Maxey Hall, and two residence halls, Lyman and Jewett. South of Ankeny Field, College Creek meanders through the main campus, filling the artificially created "Lakum Duckum", the heart of campus and the habitat for many of Whitman's beloved ducks.

The oldest building on campus is the administrative center, Whitman Memorial Building, commonly referred to as "Mem". Built in 1899, the hall, like the college, serves as a memorial to Dr.&amp;nbsp;[[Marcus Whitman|Marcus]] and [[Narcissa Whitman|Narcissa Prentiss Whitman]]. The building is the tallest on campus and was placed on the National Historical Register of Historic Places in 1974. The oldest residence halls on campus, Lyman House and Prentiss Hall, were built in 1924 and 1926. Over the next fifty years, the college built or purchased several other buildings to house students, including the former Walla Walla Valley General Hospital, which was transformed into North Hall in 1978, which was then closed in 2017. In addition to the seven Residence Halls, many students choose to live in one of eleven "Interest Houses," run for sophomores, juniors, and seniors committed to specific focuses such as community service, fine arts, environmental studies, multicultural awareness, or the French, Spanish, or German languages. These houses, like most of the residential architecture of Walla Walla, are in the [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Victorian]] or [[American Craftsman|Craftsman]] style.

In addition to property in Walla Walla, the college also has about {{convert|22000|acre|km2}} of other land holdings – mainly in the form of wheat farms in Eastern Washington and Oregon. Of special note: the Johnston Wilderness Campus, which is used for academic and social retreats.

== Academics ==
Whitman College focuses solely on undergraduate studies in the liberal arts.  All students must take a two-semester course their first year, Encounters, which examines cultural interactions throughout history and gives students a grounding in the liberal arts. Students choose from courses in 48&amp;nbsp;[[academic major|major]] fields and 34&amp;nbsp;minor fields &lt;ref name="Catalog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Whitman College Catalog|url=https://www.whitman.edu/academics/catalog|publisher=Whitman College|accessdate=29 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have wide flexibility in designing independent study programs, electing special majors, and participating in internships and study-abroad programs. Whitman's most popular majors are Biology, Psychology and Economics.&lt;ref name="Whitman College Factbook"&gt;{{cite web|title=Whitman College Factbook – Academic Year 2015-16|url=https://www.whitman.edu/Documents/Offices/Institutional%20Research/The%20Factbook%202015%20as%20of%2012.2.15(0).pdf|accessdate=29 Sep 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Whitman is noted for a strong [[Science education|science program]].

Degrees are awarded after successful completion of senior "comprehensive exams."  These exams vary depending on the students' primary focus of study, but commonly include some combination of (i)&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;senior thesis, (ii)&amp;nbsp;written examination, and (iii)&amp;nbsp;oral examination. The oral examination is either a defense of the student's senior thesis, or is one or multiple exams of material the student is expected to have learned during their major. The written exam is either a [[Graduate Record Examination|GRE]] subject test or a test composed by the department.

Dating from 1914,  "The Whitman Hymn" was written and composed by President Penrose to create school unity and spirit.

:When the morning light is breaking,
:O're the mountain's eastern rim
:And the world to work is waking
:Let us sing our happy hymn.

:Here's to the blue sky above us,
:Here's to the wheat field's gold,
:Here's to the friends that love us,
:And our love will ne'er grow cold.

:For friends and fields and mountains
:Under heaven's kindly blue.
:And the college 'mid the fountains,
:dear old Whitman here's to you

:With the joys of life before us,
:and life's battle stern and grim
:With the kindly heaven o'er us,
:We will sing our happy hymn.
