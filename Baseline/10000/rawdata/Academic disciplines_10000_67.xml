'''AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism''' (Also commonly referred to as '''AP Physics C: E&amp;M''', or simply '''E&amp;M''') is an [[Advanced Placement Program|Advanced Placement]] [[science]] course about [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]]. It is one of the four [[AP Physics]] courses offered in some [[Secondary education in the United States|U.S. secondary schools]].

==Course content==

It is supposed to be equivalent to an introductory [[college]] course in [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] for physics or engineering majors.&lt;ref name=PhysCe&amp;mOverview&gt;{{citation | url = http://media.collegeboard.com/digitalServices/pdf/ap/ap-course-overviews/ap-physics-c-mechanics-course-overview.pdf | format = PDF | title = AP® PHYSICS C: ELECTRICITY &amp; MAGNETISM | publisher = [[College Board]] | date = December 2016 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course modules are:&lt;ref name=PhysCe&amp;mOverview /&gt;
* Electrostatics
* Conductors, capacitors, and dielectrics
* Electric circuits
* Magnetic fields
* Electromagnetism.

Methods of [[calculus]] are used wherever appropriate in formulating physical principles and in applying them to physical problems. Therefore, students should have completed or be concurrently enrolled in a calculus class.&lt;ref name=PhysCe&amp;mOverview /&gt;

This course may be combined with [[AP Physics C: Mechanics]] to make a unified Physics C course that prepares for both exams. In this scenario, Electricity and Magnetism is typically taught second, as it requires much of the knowledge gained in the Mechanics course.

==AP test==
The course culminates in an optional exam for which high-performing students may receive some credit towards their college coursework, depending on which college or university they attend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/creditandplacement | title = Credit &amp; Placement | work = AP Students | publisher = The [[College Board]] | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Registration===
The AP examination for AP Physics C: Electricity and Magnetism is separate from the AP examination for AP Physics C: Mechanics. Before 2006, test-takers paid only once and were given the choice of taking either one or two parts of the Physics C test.

===Format===
The exam is configured in two categories: a 35-question [[multiple choice]] section and a 3-question [[free response]] section.&lt;ref name=PhysCe&amp;mOverview /&gt; Test takers are allowed to use an approved calculator during the entire exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-physics-c-mechanics/calculator-and-table-policies | title = AP Physics C: Mechanics – Calculator and Table Policies | work = AP Students | publisher = [[College Board]] | year = 2017 | access-date = January 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test is weighted such that each section is worth half of the final score.&lt;ref name=PhysCe&amp;mOverview /&gt; This and [[AP Physics C: Mechanics]] are the shortest AP exams, with total testing time of 90 minutes.&lt;ref name=PhysCe&amp;mOverview /&gt;

The topics covered by the exam are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/physics_c/topics.html | title = Topic Outline | work = College Board Tests | publisher = The College Board | year = 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130404054146/http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/physics_c/topics.html | archive-date = April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aidoh''' is an [[shortening]] for ''Art In Defence Of Humanism''. AIDOH was created by the Danish artist [[Jens Galschiot]] as a [[interest group|group]] focusing on the inhuman treatment of [[people]] in different countries related to political, religious or economic interests. The group has with several occasions started a public debate about the individual countries overconsumption or governments repressive treatment of its own [[people]].

==Manifests==

===My inner beast (1993)===
[[Pigs]] in coats made of 1 ton black [[concrete]]. Is named one of the biggest art [[happening]]s in [[Europe]]. 20 sculptures were placered on public places in [[Europe]] without official approval. It took 55 hours to put the "pigs" up, and the [[happening]] created a lot of public debate.

===The silent death (1995)===
In connection with [[UN]]'s sociale [[summit]] in [[Copenhagen]], were there placed 750 dolls, that pictured dead children in the age of 3–9 years. They were placed on street lamps, benches, fountains and other places to symbolizes the 35.000 children's that dies every day in the [[world]].

===[[Pillar of Shame]] (1997)===
Were placed in [[Hong Kong]] June 4, 1997. Since it has been placed in many other places in the world where the governments does not respect the [[human right]]s. 
The [[Pillar of Shame]] is in copper and is 8 meters tall. It consists of more than 50 tangled human bodies in pain. 
The [[Pillar of Shame]] is like a [[Nobel Prize]] in injustice.

===[[WTO]] Hong Kong (2005)===
Following sculptures were placed in [[Hong Kong]] at December 2005:
* Mad Cow Disease
* The survival of the fattest
* Hunger match

===[[In the name of God (art installation)|In the name of God]] (2006)===
[[In the name of God (art installation)|In the name of God]] is a number of art installations, that puts focus on Catholics prohibition against the use of [[condoms]]. It consists of a crucified pregnant teenager. It has been exhibited in [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Kenya]].

'''Ask A Biologist''' is a [[science outreach]] program originating from [[Arizona State University]]'s School of [[Life Sciences]].

==About the program==

Ask A Biologist is a pre-kindergarten through high school program dedicated to answering questions from students, their teachers, and parents. The primary focus of the program is to connect students and teachers with working scientists through a question and answer Web e-mail form. The companion website also includes a large collection of free content and activities that can be used inside, as well as outside, of the classroom. The award-winning program has been continuously running for more than 14 years, with the assistance of more than 150 volunteer scientists, faculty, and graduate students in biology and related fields. In 2010 the program released its new website interface and features that became the subject for articles in the journals
[[Science (journal)|Science]]&lt;ref name="rc10"&gt;{{cite web

===Primary audience===

Ask A Biologist materials are free and open to anyone with access to the [[World Wide Web|World-Wide-Web]]. The question portion of the program serves primarily students, grades pre[[K–12 (education)|K-12]], as well as their teachers and parents. In addition, lifelong learners are encouraged to use the website materials.

===History===

Ask A Biologist was launched late in 1997 in the School of Life Sciences, with an early version&lt;ref name="rc1"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://lsvl.la.asu.edu/askabiologist/
|title=Early Ask A Biologist Web Page
|accessdate=January 12, 2009
|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990222162859/http://lsvl.la.asu.edu/askabiologist/
|archivedate=February 22, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; viewable on the [[Internet Archive]] a.k.a. The WayBackMachine. Initially, the site consisted solely of a question submission form, a feature that remains one of its core activities.

By 2001, the site had grown to over 1,000 pages of content, including articles about current research, profiles of scientists, an image gallery, mystery images, puzzles, coloring pages, quizzes, and science activities.

In 2003, the website released the Virtual Pocket Seed Experiment, the first of several data sets that could be used in and outside of the classroom. The experiment was based on the classic seed germination experiment, but included the feature of time-lapse animation of various seed experiments.

In 2004, a second data set was released, in cooperation with [[Audubon International|Audubon]] Arizona. The Virtual Bird Aviary, included the majority of bird species found in the Southwest United States including more than 400 vocal recordings and companion [[Spectrogram|sonograms]], bird images, text descriptions, and range maps.

In 2005, the website was peer reviewed by the Multimedia Educational Resource for Learning and Online Teaching (MERLOT), earning a "five out of five star" rating.&lt;ref name="rc2"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.merlot.org/merlot/viewMaterial.htm?id=80436
|title=Ask A Biologist
|date= 2005 |accessdate=January 14, 2009
|publisher=MERLOT}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2006, the website introduced the Mysterious World of Dr. Biology a [[Comics in education|comic book]] adventure. The activity encouraged students to piece together a mystery. Students reconstructed a chain of events in the Dr. Biology laboratory and field site, writing their own narrative for the story.

Early in 2007, Ask A Biologist became one of the early content channels on [[iTunes]] U with its audio [[podcast]] of the same name. Hosted by Dr. Biology, the program was soon listed as one of five great courses by Macworld.&lt;ref name="rc3"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/59887-2/2007/09/oct07playlist.html
|title=The iPod study buddy: Five Great Courses
|date=September 2007 |accessdate=January 14, 2009
|publisher=Macworld}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the guest scientists interviewed on the show included [[biologist]]s and [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning authors [[Edward O. Wilson]] and [[Bert Hölldobler]], as well as [[physicist]] and writer [[Paul Davies]].
 
In 2008, the audio podcast program introduced a co-host contest&lt;ref name="rc4"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.merlot.org/merlot/viewMaterial.htm?id=80436
|title=At the head(phones) of their class: Elementary school students win K-12 podcast contest
|accessdate=January 14, 2009
|publisher=AAAS}}&lt;/ref&gt; that offered students in the [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] metro area the opportunity to meet and interview working scientists.

In 2009, the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) funded the redesign of the Ask A Biologist website including the addition of [[Web 2.0]] tools as part of the [[National Science Digital Library]] (NSDL).

In 2010, Ask A Biologist released its new website developed using a Web content management tool [[Drupal]] and adding Web 2.0 options. The new content management expanded website features including translations of content into French and Spanish and an improved interface for audio streaming. The website was officially accessioned by the NSDL in September.

In 2011 two new sections were added to the website. Body Depot is a collaborative project with the [[Arizona Science Center]] funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH). PLOSable is a project that links plain language and kid-friendly reviews to primary source publications in journals of the [[Public Library of Science]].

Established in 1948, the '''Audio Engineering Society''' ('''AES''') draws its membership from engineers, scientists, other individuals with an interest or involvement in the [[professional audio]] industry. The membership largely comprises engineers developing devices or products for audio, and persons working in audio content production. It also includes [[acoustician]]s, [[audiologist]]s, academics, and those in other disciplines related to audio. The AES is the only worldwide professional society devoted exclusively to audio technology.

The Society develops, reviews and publishes engineering standards for the audio and related media industries, and produces the '''AES Conventions''', which are held twice a year alternating between Europe and the US. The AES and individual regional or national ''sections'' also hold ''AES Conferences'' on different topics during the year.

==History==
The idea of a society dedicated solely to audio engineering had been discussed for some time before the first meeting, but was first proposed in print in a letter by Frank E. Sherry, of Victoria, Texas, in the December 1947 issue of the magazine [[Audio (magazine)|''Audio Engineering'']]. A New York engineer and audio consultant, C.J. LeBel, then published a letter agreeing, and saying that a group of audio professionals had already been discussing such a thing, and that they were interested in holding an organizational meeting. He asked interested persons to contact him for details. The response was enthusiastic and encouraging. Fellow engineer [[Norman C. Pickering]] published the date for an organizational meeting, and announced the appointment of LeBel as acting chairman, and himself as acting secretary.

The organizational meeting was held at the RCA Victor Studios in New York City on February 17, 1948. Acting chairman Mr. LeBel spoke first, emphasizing the professional, non-commercial, independent nature of the proposed organization. Acting Secretary Norman Pickering then discussed the need for a professional organization that could foster an exchange of knowledge in this quickly-growing field. The group agreed to form the Audio Engineering Society, and confirmed the acting executive committee, which consisted of John D. Colvin, C. J. LeBel, C. G. McProud, Norman C. Pickering and Chester O. Rackey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=November 1973 | title = How it All Began | journal = Journal of the Audio Engineering Society | volume =  21 | issue = Nr 21 | pages =35, 37, 39, 41 | url = http://www.aes.org/aeshc/AES_How-It-All-Began.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first AES technical membership meeting followed on March 11, with about 3500 attendees. The guest speaker at the first meeting was [[Harry F. Olson]], a prominent engineer and scientist at [[RCA]] and author of ''[[Acoustical engineering (book)|Acoustical Engineering]]'', who spoke on ''Problems of High-Fidelity Reproduction''.

==Membership==
From its New York beginnings, the AES has grown worldwide and as of October 31, 2010 had 14215 members, 4306 of whom are classified as students.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Members elect a Board of Governors and officers, who jointly set policy and procedures for the Society. The AES is a tax-exempt, 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation headquartered in New York.

==Journal==&lt;!--[[JAES]] redirects here--&gt;
The AES publishes a peer-reviewed journal, the ''Journal of the Audio Engineering Society'' (JAES).

==Conventions and conferences==
The AES produces two conventions each year as well as a number of topic-specific conferences. The fall convention is in North America and the Spring convention is in Europe. The first convention was in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aes.org/events/conventions/ |title=AES Conventions |access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical Council==
23 Technical Committees advise the AES Technical Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aes.org/technical |title=AES Technical Council and Committees |accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; on emerging trends and areas of interest in the audio engineering community. The Committee meetings, held at Conventions, are open to participation by members and non-members alike, and are the venue for planning workshops, seminars and conferences in specific technical areas.

==Standards==
The AES has been involved in setting technical standards for audio since 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/aeshist/standards.hist/digital.standards/history-of-aes-digital-audio-eng-standardization.html |title=History of AES Digital Audio Engineering Standardization |accessdate=2015-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AES Standards Committee (AESSC), through a consensus system open to anyone materially affected by such standards, develops and publishes a number of standards on the subject of analog and digital audio recording, transmission, and/or reproduction. Notable standards include:

* [[AES3]] (also commonly known as AES/EBU) for digital audio interconnection
* [[AES10]] (also commonly known as MADI) for multichannel digital audio interconnection
* [[AES11]] for digital audio synchronization
* [[AES31]] file exchange format
* [[AES42]] for digitally interfaced microphones
* [[AES47]], [[AES51]] and [[AES53]] for sending AES3 digital audio data over [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] networks
* [[AES48]] on interconnections; grounding and EMC practices; and shields of connectors in audio equipment containing active circuitry
* [[AES64]] for coarse-groove mechanical audio recordings
* [[AES67]] for [[audio over IP]] interoperability

AESSC also provides input to [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] for development and revision of international standards in audio engineering.

AES does not charge for participation in the standards process, but does charge non-members for online copies of published standards.  Printed copies are available for a charge to both members and non-members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aes.org/standards |title=AES Standards |accessdate=2011-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gold Medal recipients==
The AES Gold Medal is the Society's highest honor, and given in recognition of outstanding achievements, sustained over a period of years, in the field of Audio Engineering. The award was established in 1971; it was formerly known as the John H. Potts Memorial Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aes.org/awards/nominations/guidelines.cfm About the Audio Engineering Society. ''Award Guidelines'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==British section==

The AES British Section, which is the largest outside the US, issues a monthly newsletter and holds regular lectures, usually in London, with occasional visits to studios and other places of interest. Lectures, which are often on topics of topical interest to audio enthusiasts are usually recorded, with past lectures available to all as free MP3 downloads, sometimes with accompanying slides in PDF format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aes-uk.org/meetings/|title=Audio Engineering Society UK - Meetings|publisher=AES UK section|accessdate=2016-03-15|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connection with the VDT==

Although there are several German sections of the AES and there is no formal connection to the [[Verband Deutscher Tonmeister]], the goals and activities of both organizations are closely related and there are several instances of double memberships, e.g. in the persons of Benjamin Bernfeld,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/jaes.obit/JAES_V59_12_PG1002.pdf Obituary for Benjamin Bernfeld 1928–2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Gerhard Steinke&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aes.org/technical/heyser/aes122.cfm Gerhard Steinke]&lt;/ref&gt; and Günther Theile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hauptmikrofon.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=68 hauptmikrofon.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9972">'''Auditory arrhythmia''' is the inability to rhythmically perform music, to [[Meter (music)|keep time]], and to replicate musical or rhythmic patterns. It has been caused by damage to the [[cerebrum]] or rewiring of the brain.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Modelling rhythmic function in a musician post-stroke|last = Wilson|first = Sarah J|date = 2002|journal = Neuropsychologia|doi = 10.1016/S0028-3932(01)00198-1|pmid = 11931954|last2 = Pressing|first2 = Jeffrey L|last3 = Wales|first3 = Roger J|volume=40|pages=1494–505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
An individual with this condition has an especially difficult time maintaining a steady beat, and even has difficulty following along to a steady rhythm. Before it was a known disorder, it was thought that these individuals were just severely uncoordinated, and therefore were unable to follow along with the music. It has been discovered recently that problems with rhythm in [[Schizophrenia]], [[Parkinson's]], and [[Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder]] are also found to have a correlation to rhythm deficiencies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Arrhythmic Song Exposure Increases ZENK Expression in Auditory Cortical Areas and Nucleus Taeniae of the Adult Zebra Finch|date = September 26, 2014|journal = US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0108841|pmid = 25259620|editor-last = Cooper|editor-first = Brenton G.|pmc=4178233|volume=9|pages=e108841 | last1 = Lampen | first1 = J | last2 = Jones | first2 = K | last3 = McAuley | first3 = JD | last4 = Chang | first4 = SE | last5 = Wade | first5 = J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neurological bases of music ==
The [[cerebellum]] houses the center for fine motor skills. These are needed in order to play the instrument.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}

The [[temporal lobe]] and the [[frontal lobe]] are necessary for listening and recalling different musical aspects from lyrics, reading the music, and performing.

Memory centers are primarily located in the [[hippocampus]], and the process of listening to music originates there.

[[Neuroplasticity]] allows the brain to grow and change, especially in the [[Auditory cortex|auditory]] and [[motor cortex]]. Listening and playing music helps both of these areas of the brain to develop more, which was found to be correlated to having an improves auditory imagery in many performers in a study conducted at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://brainworldmagazine.com/music-rhythm-and-the-brain-2/|title = Music, Rhythm and the Brain|date = March 7, 2011|accessdate = February 18, 2015|website = Brain World|publisher = Brain World|last = Jun, M.D.|first = Passion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar diagnoses ==
Auditory arrhythmia can also be confused with something called [[beat deafness]]. Beat deafness is a form of congenital [[amusia]], which is a person's inability to move in time to the music, or feel a musical rhythm. It is believed by researchers that beat deafness stems from a connection problem between the brain's auditory cortex and inferior frontal lobe. A postdoctoral researcher with the International Laboratory for Brain, Music, and Sound Research at the University of Montreal studied a case where a man could not feel a rhythm in any sense. Not only did he have difficulty dancing, but he was unable to tap his foot or snap his fingers along with the beat of the music.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The major difference between beat deafness and auditory arrhythmia, however, is that beat deafness is most likely something you are born with, whereas the arrhythmia most likely comes from damage, which was the case in the research done on "Mathieu," the first known case of beat-deafness.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://bodyodd.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/03/15/6247114-cant-feel-the-rhythm-you-may-be-beat-deaf?lite|title = Can't feel the rhythm? You may be 'beat-deaf'|date = Mar 15, 2011|accessdate = February 19, 2015|website = The Body Odd|publisher = NBC News|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In another case, a former musician known as H.J. suffered damage from a [[Temporoparietal junction|temporoparietal infarct]], which is an area of dead tissue due to lack of adequate blood supply. The infarct was believed to have been caused by a problem during a coronary angiography, which is a test to show the insides of an individual's coronary arteries. H.J. suffered difficulties with creating a steady beat, an inability to distinguish between different sets of rhythms, and also experienced difficulties when playing his instruments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Rhythmic problems in animals other than humans ==
Research was conducted on birds such as the Zebra Finch because this species has parallels to humans' vocal learning patterns and neurological structures. Adult zebra finches were placed in similar conditions, all exposed to nine rhythmic and nine arrhythmic songs for 30 second increments. After the stimulus was presented, the brains were studied for areas of high ZENK concentration, ZENK being an [[immunohistochemical]] used to detect neural activation. It was found in the finches that those exposed to the arrhythmic music had much higher levels of the ZENK gene, and it has been discovered that there is a correlation with humans having higher brain activity in these locations with arrhythmic functioning. Gaining an understanding of how to change the deficiencies in these animals can help lead to changes in the future for humans with auditory arrhythmia and other serious psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Auditory processing in those with autism ==
Those diagnosed with [[autism]] tend to have many difficulties processing auditory stimuli. For example, they most often endure language and speech delays, [[hyperacusis]], have difficulties communicating in large social groups, and may experience difficulties hearing certain voices in a noisy environment. These qualities make quality of life difficult, by inhibiting their ability to fully participate in social and educational circumstances in various parts of their lives. As shown in research published in the International Journal of Psychophysiology, [[efferent pathways]] throughout the brain help to control various functions throughout the body. For example, in those with autism, pathways running through to the [[middle ear]] muscles make it difficult for the person to focus on a single voice when there is a lot of background noise. Raising eyelids was also found to hinder the [[stapedius]] muscle by tensing it, which in turn makes it difficult for these individuals to hear other talking when there is background noise present. The laryngeal and pharyngeal muscles located in the throat make [[Prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] difficult to understand for people with autism. During research, tasks and tests were conducted to see if there is a correlation between [[cardiac rhythm]]s, [[respiratory sinus arrhythmias]], and [[auditory processing]], or auditory arrhythmia. Because these symptoms tend to go hand in hand, researchers were looking to see if there was a possibility of improving auditory processing. If researchers learn how to effectively improve auditory sensations in people diagnose with autism, then there is a possibility that they can then begin finding the improvement for those only suffering from auditory arrhythmia.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Respiratory sinus arrhythmia and auditory processing in autism: Modifiable deficits of an integrated social engagement system?|last = Porges|first = Stephen W.|date = November 29, 2012|journal = Psychophysiology of Relationships|doi = 10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2012.11.009|pmid = 23201146|last2 = Macellaio|first2 = Matthew|last3 = Stanfill|first3 = Shannon D.|last4 = McCue|first4 = Kimberly|last5 = Lewis|first5 = Gregory F.|last6 = Harden|first6 = Emily R.|last7 = Handelman|first7 = Mika|last8 = Denver|first8 = John|last9 = Bazhenova|first9 = Olga V.|pmc=3610863|volume=88|pages=261–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Easter Seals Metropolitan Chicago Therapeutic School and Center for Autism Research has conducted studies on auditory processing in individuals with autism.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The International Laboratory for Brain, Music, and Sound Research at the University of Montreal has found that beat and tone deafness are likely genetic, and believe that it is because of a miswiring between the auditory cortex and inferior frontal cortex.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; They were also major researchers on Mathieu's case of beat deafness.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Studies conducted at Utrecht University in the Netherlands show that there is an association with an improves ability for auditory imagery and music.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; McGill University also studied Mathieu's case, along with another individual known as Marjorie. The studies conducted show that true beat deafness is an extremely rare disorder, because out of all the individuals who applied thinking they were beat deaf, Marjorie and Mathieu were the only two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2014/11/12/why-some-people-just-cant-dance-or-clap-to-the-beat/|title = Why some people just can’t dance or clap to the beat|date = November 12, 2014|accessdate = February 21, 2015|website = The Washington Post|publisher = |last = Philip|first = Abby}}&lt;/ref&gt; H.J.'s case has been studied in Victoria, Australia at the University of Melbourne and La Trobe University.

'''Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar''' (14 April 1891&amp;nbsp;– 6 December 1956), popularly known as '''Babasaheb Ambedkar''', was an Indian [[jurist]], [[economist]], [[politician]] and [[Social Reformer|social reformer]] who inspired the [[Dalit Buddhist movement]] and campaigned against social [[discrimination]] towards the [[Untouchability|untouchables]] (''[[Dalit]]s''), while also supporting the rights of women and [[Labour movement|labour]].&lt;ref name="firstpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpost.com/politics/rescuing-ambedkar-from-pure-dalitism-he-wouldve-been-indias-best-prime-minister-2195498.html|title=Rescuing Ambedkar from pure Dalitism: He would've been India's best Prime Minister|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106214027/http://www.firstpost.com/politics/rescuing-ambedkar-from-pure-dalitism-he-wouldve-been-indias-best-prime-minister-2195498.html|archivedate=6 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryant, Edwin 2001. pp. 50-51"&gt;Bryant, Edwin.

Ambedkar was a prolific student earning [[doctorate]]s in economics from both [[Columbia University]] and the [[London School of Economics]] and gained a reputation as a scholar for his research in law, economics, and [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/archives-released-by-lse-reveal-br-ambedkar-s-time-as-a-scholar/story-N2sq6Bm6OlxwQZkz6vBzvM.html|title=Archives released by LSE reveal BR Ambedkar's time as a scholar|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209050301/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/archives-released-by-lse-reveal-br-ambedkar-s-time-as-a-scholar/story-N2sq6Bm6OlxwQZkz6vBzvM.html|archivedate=9 February 2016|df=dmy-all|date=2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his early career he was an economist, professor, and lawyer.

In 1990, the [[Bharat Ratna]], India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred upon Ambedkar. Ambedkar's legacy includes numerous memorials and depictions in popular culture.

==Early life==

Ambedkar was born on 14 April 1891 in the town and military cantonment of [[Mhow]] (now [[Dr. Ambedkar Nagar]]) in the [[Central Provinces]] (now in [[Madhya Pradesh]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaffrelot |first=Christophe |title = Ambedkar and Untouchability: Fighting the Indian Caste System|year= 2005 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|location=New York|isbn= 978-0-231-13602-0 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the 14th and last child of [[Ramji Maloji Sakpal]], an army officer who held the rank of [[Subedar]], and Bhimabai Sakpal, daughter of Laxman Murbadkar.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1890s.html| title = In the 1890s| format = PHP| accessdate = 2 August 2006| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907040421/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1890s.html| archivedate= 7 September 2006 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Ambedkar family|family]] was of [[Marathi people|Marathi]] background from the town of [[Ambadawe]] ([[Mandangad|Mandangad taluka]]) in [[Ratnagiri (district)|Ratnagiri district]] of modern-day [[Maharashtra]].

Although they attended school, Ambedkar and other untouchable children were segregated and given little attention or help by teachers. They were not allowed to sit inside the class. When they needed to drink water, someone from a higher caste had to pour that water from a height as they were not allowed to touch either the water or the vessel that contained it. This task was usually performed for the young Ambedkar by the school [[peon]], and if the peon was not available then he had to go without water; he described the situation later in his writings as "No peon, No Water".&lt;ref name = "Waiting for Visa"&gt;{{cite web|others= Frances Pritchett, translator |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_waiting.html |title=Waiting for a Visa|first= B.

Ramji Sakpal retired in 1894 and the family moved to [[Satara district|Satara]] two years later. Shortly after their move, Ambedkar's mother died. The children were cared for by their paternal aunt and lived in difficult circumstances. Three sons&amp;nbsp;– Balaram, Anandrao and Bhimrao&amp;nbsp;– and two daughters&amp;nbsp;– Manjula and Tulasa&amp;nbsp;– of the Ambedkars survived them. Of his brothers and sisters, only Ambedkar passed his examinations and went to high school.

==Education==
===Post-secondary education===
In 1897, Ambedkar's family moved to Mumbai where Ambedkar became the only untouchable enrolled at [[Elphinstone High School]]. In 1906, when he was about 15 years old, his marriage to a nine-year-old girl, Ramabai, was [[Arranged marriage in the Indian subcontinent|arranged]].&lt;ref name="Columbia2"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1900s.html| title = In the 1900s| format = PHP| accessdate = 5 January 2012| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106043617/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1900s.html| archivedate = 6 January 2012| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undergraduate studies at the University of Bombay===
[[File:Young Ambedkar.gif|thumb|upright|Ambedkar as a student]]
In 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year he entered [[Elphinstone College]], which was affiliated to the [[University of Bombay]], becoming the first untouchable to do so. In his book, ''The Buddha and his Dhamma'', that when he passed his English fourth standard examinations, the people of his community wanted to celebrate because they considered that he had reached "great heights" which he says was "hardly an occasion compared to the state of education in other communities". A public ceremony was evoked, to celebrate his success, by the community, and it was at this occasion that he was presented with a biography of the Buddha by Dada Keluskar, the author and a family friend.&lt;ref name="Columbia2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_buddha/00_pref_unpub.html unpublished preface of "The Buddha and his Dhamma"], cite 5th para&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University, and prepared to take up employment with the Baroda state government. His wife had just moved his young family and started work when he had to quickly return to Mumbai to see his ailing father, who died on 2 February 1913.&lt;ref name="Columbia3"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1910s.html| title = In the 1910s| format = PHP| accessdate = 5 January 2012| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123170145/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1910s.html| archivedate = 23 November 2011| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postgraduate studies at Columbia University===
In 1913, Ambedkar moved to the United States at the age of 22. He had been awarded a Baroda State Scholarship of £11.50 (Sterling) per month for three years under a scheme established by [[Sayajirao Gaekwad III]] ([[Gaekwad]] of [[Princely State of Baroda|Baroda]]) that was designed to provide opportunities for postgraduate education at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]]. Soon after arriving there he settled in rooms at [[Wallach Hall|Livingston Hall]] with Naval Bhathena, a [[Parsi]] who was to be a lifelong friend. He passed his M.A. exam in June 1915, majoring in Economics, and other subjects of Sociology, History, Philosophy and Anthropology. He presented a thesis, ''Ancient Indian Commerce''. Ambedkar was influenced by [[John Dewey]] and his work on democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/VGJT8kkl9dGnqWpkgft9QM/Ambedkars-teacher.html|title=Ambedkar teacher|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403032535/http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/VGJT8kkl9dGnqWpkgft9QM/Ambedkars-teacher.html|archivedate=3 April 2016|df=dmy-all|date=2016-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1916 he completed his second thesis, ''National Dividend of India&amp;nbsp;– A Historic and Analytical Study'', for another M.A., and finally he received his PhD in Economics in 1927&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/bhimrao_ambedkar.html|title=Bhimrao Ambedkar|work=columbia.edu|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140210115211/http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/bhimrao_ambedkar.html|archivedate=10 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his third thesis, after he left for London. On 9 May, he presented the paper ''[[Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development]]'' before a seminar conducted by the anthropologist [[Alexander Goldenweiser (anthropologist)|Alexander Goldenweiser]].

===Postgraduate studies at the London School of Economics===

In October 1916, he enrolled for the [[Bar examination|Bar course]] at [[Gray's Inn]], and at the same time enrolled at the London School of Economics where he started working on a doctoral thesis. In June 1917, he returned to India because his scholarship from Baroda ended. His book collection was dispatched on different ship from the one he was on, and that ship was torpedoed and sunk by a German submarine.&lt;ref name="Columbia3" /&gt; He got permission to return to London to submit his thesis within four years. He returned at the first opportunity, and completed a master's degree in 1921. His thesis was on "The problem of the rupee: Its origin and its solution".&lt;ref name="firstpost.com"/&gt; In 1922, he was called to the Bar by Gray's Inn and In 1923, he completed a D.Sc. in Economics. His third and fourth Doctorates (LL.D, Columbia, 1952 and D.Litt., Osmania, 1953) were conferred ''honoris causa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Wx218EFVU8MC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=ambedkar%20D'Litt#v=onepage&amp;q=ambedkar%20D'Litt|title=Dalit Movement in India and Its Leaders, 1857-1956|first=Rāmacandra|last=Kshīrasāgara|date=1 January 1994|publisher=M.D. Publications Pvt.

==Opposition to untouchability==
[[File:Ambedkar Barrister.jpg|thumb|upright|Ambedkar as a barrister in 1922]]
As Ambedkar was educated by the Princely State of Baroda, he was bound to serve it. He was appointed Military Secretary to the Gaikwad but had to quit in a short time. He described the incident in his autobiography, ''[[Waiting for a Visa]]''.&lt;ref name="Rewriting for Visa"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ambedkar|first1=Dr. B.R.|title=Waiting for a Visa|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_waiting.html|website=columbia.edu|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=15 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624202609/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/txt_ambedkar_waiting.html|archivedate=24 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, he tried to find ways to make a living for his growing family. He worked as a private tutor, as an accountant, and established an investment consulting business, but it failed when his clients learned that he was an untouchable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Keer |first1=Dhananjay |title=Dr. Ambedkar: Life and Mission |year=1971 |origyear=1954 |publisher=Popular Prakashan |location=Mumbai |isbn=978-8171542376 |oclc=123913369 |pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, he became Professor of Political Economy in the [[Sydenham College|Sydenham College of Commerce and Economics]] in Mumbai. Although he was successful with the students, other professors objected to his sharing a drinking-water jug with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-first= Ian |editor-last= Harris |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0rwiLKm3LGUC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=ambedkar+discriminated+at+Sydenham+College+of+Comme#v=onepage&amp;q=ambedkar%20discriminated%20at%20Sydenham%20College%20of%20Comme |title=Buddhism and politics in twentieth-century Asia |publisher=Continuum International Group |isbn= 9780826451781 |date= 2001-08-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambedkar had been invited to testify before the [[Southborough Committee]], which was preparing the [[Government of India Act 1919]]. At this hearing, Ambedkar argued for creating separate [[electoral district|electorates]] and [[reservation in India|reservations]] for untouchables and other religious communities.&lt;ref name=Tejani&gt;{{cite book|last=Tejani|first=Shabnum|title=Indian secularism : a social and intellectual history, 1890-1950|year=2008|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Ind.|isbn=978-0253220448|pages=205–210|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xtrPKa59j4C&amp;pg=PA205&amp;dq=%22ambedkar%22+%22+Southborough+Committee%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ambedkar%22%20%22%20Southborough%20Committee%22|accessdate=17 July 2013|chapter=From Untouchable to Hindu Gandhi, Ambedkar and Depressed class question 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920, he began the publication of the weekly ''Mooknayak'' (''Leader of the Silent'') in Mumbai with the help of [[Shahu of Kolhapur]] i.e. Shahu IV (1874–1922).&lt;ref name="Jaffrelot"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffrelot |first1=Christophe |title=Dr Ambedkar and Untouchability: Analysing and Fighting Caste |year=2005 |publisher=C.

Ambedkar went on to work as a legal professional. In 1926, he successfully defended three non-Brahmin leaders who had accused the Brahmin community of ruining India and were then subsequently sued for libel. [[Dhananjay Keer]] notes that "The victory was resounding, both socially and individually, for the clients and the Doctor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=B-2d6jzRmBQC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;lpg=PA64&amp;dq=The+victory+was+resounding,+both+socially+and+individually,+for+the+clients+and+the+Doctor.|title=Dr. Ambedkar: Life and Mission|last=Keer|first=Dhananjay|date=1995|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=9788171542376|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=5u9hDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT30&amp;lpg=PT30&amp;dq=The+victory+was+resounding,+both+socially+and+individually,+for+the+clients+and+the+Doctor.|title=7 Reformers who Change the World|last=Mookherji|first=Kalyani|date=101-01-01|publisher=Prabhat Prakashan|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While practising law in the Bombay High Court, he tried to promote education to untouchables and uplift them. His first organised attempt was his establishment of the central institution [[Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha]], intended to promote education and socio-economic improvement, as well as the welfare of "[[Dalit|outcastes]]", at the time referred to as depressed classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdhr.org.in/ncdhr/general-info-misc-pages/dr-ambedkar |title=Dr. Ambedkar |accessdate=12 January 2012 |publisher=National Campaign on Dalit Human Rights |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008195805/http://www.ncdhr.org.in/ncdhr/general-info-misc-pages/dr-ambedkar |archivedate=8 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the defence of Dalit rights, he started five periodicals - ''Mooknayak'' (the leader of the dumb, 1920), ''Bahishkrit Bharat'' (Ostracized India, 1924), ''Samta'' (Equality, 1928), ''Janata'' (The People, 1930), and ''Prabuddha Bharat'' (Enlightened India, 1956).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forwardpress.in/2017/07/ambedkars-journalism-and-its-significance-today/|title=Ambedkar’s journalism and its significance today|date=2017-07-05|work=Forward Press|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://velivada.com/2018/03/28/dr-ambedkar-as-a-journalist/|title=http://velivada.com/2018/03/28/dr-ambedkar-as-a-journalist/|website=velivada.com|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://marathivishwakosh.maharashtra.gov.in/khandas/khand17/index.php/23-2015-01-15-05-42-45/9964-2012-06-14-09-33-10?showall=&amp;start=12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://prahaar.in/%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0-%E0%A4%A1%E0%A5%89-%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%AC-%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%AC/|title=पत्रकार डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर {{!}}|website=prahaar.in|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mahamtb.com/Encyc/2017/12/6/Article-on-journalist-babasaheb-Ambedkar-by-ravindra-gole.html|title=पत्रकार आंबेडकर|website=mahamtb.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=S|first=Kamble, Rajeev|date=2002-12-31|title=Dr Ambedkar as a journalist a study|url=http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/104917|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beedlive.com/newsdetail?cat=Madhyam&amp;id=2046&amp;news=%E0%A4%A1%E0%A5%89.%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AC%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%AC%20%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%AC%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%A1%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%82%E0%A4%9A%E0%A5%80%20%E0%A4%86%E0%A4%A6%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B6%20%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%BE.html|title=डॉ.बाबासाहेब आंबेडकरांची आदर्श पत्रकारिता|website=beedlive.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mahanews.gov.in/Home/FrontMantralayDetails.aspx?str=utYf/MWKOh8=|title=डॉ. बाबासाहेब आंबेडकर एक बहुआयामी व्यक्तीमत्त्व - डॉ. गंगाधर पानतावणे|website=mahanews.gov.in|access-date=2018-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benjamin|first=Joseph|title=B.

By 1927, Ambedkar had decided to launch active movements against [[untouchability]]. He began with public movements and marches to open up public drinking water resources. He also began a struggle for the right to enter Hindu temples. He led a ''[[Mahad Satyagraha|satyagraha]]'' in [[Mahad]] to fight for the right of the untouchable community to draw water from the main water tank of the town.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manase.org/en/maharashtra.php?mid=68&amp;smid=23&amp;pmid=1&amp;id=857 |title=Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar |accessdate=26 December 2010 |publisher=Maharashtra Navanirman Sena |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510041016/https://www.manase.org/en/maharashtra.php?mid=68&amp;smid=23&amp;pmid=1&amp;id=857 |archivedate=10 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a conference in late 1927, Ambedkar publicly condemned the classic Hindu text, the [[Manusmriti]] (Laws of Manu), for ideologically justifying caste discrimination and "untouchability", and he ceremonially burned copies of the ancient text.

In 1930, Ambedkar launched Kalaram Temple movement after three months of preparation. About 15,000 volunteers assembled at [[Kalaram Temple]] satygraha making one of the greatest processions of [[Nashik]]. The procession was headed by a military band, a batch of scouts, women and men walked in discipline, order and determination to see the god for the first time.

[[Gandhi]] fiercely opposed a separate electorate for untouchables, saying he feared that such an arrangement would divide the Hindu community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poona Pact – 1932|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469892/Poona-Pact|website=Britannica.com|publisher=''Encyclopædia Britannica''|accessdate=29 April 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518073354/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/469892/Poona-Pact|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ambekar vs Gandhi: A Part That Parted|url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article/a-part-that-parted/281929|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=Outlook|date=20 August 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427033738/http://www.outlookindia.com/article/a-part-that-parted/281929|archivedate=27 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Museum to showcase Poona Pact|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Museum-to-showcase-Poona-Pact/articleshow/2400058.cms|accessdate=29 April 2015|publisher=''The Times of India''|date=25 September 2007|quote=Read 8th Paragraph|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017053453/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/Museum-to-showcase-Poona-Pact/articleshow/2400058.cms|archivedate=17 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi protested by fasting while imprisoned in the [[Yerwada Central Jail]] of [[Poona]]. Following the fast, Congress politicians and activists such as [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] and [[Palwankar Baloo]] organised joint meetings with Ambedkar and his supporters at Yerwada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Omvedt |first1=Gail |year=2012 |title=A Part That Parted |journal=Outlook India |url=http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?281929 |accessdate=12 August 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812003046/http://outlookindia.com/article.aspx?281929 |archivedate=12 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 September 1932, the agreement known as [[Poona Pact]] was signed between Ambedkar (on behalf of the depressed classes among Hindus) and [[Madan Mohan Malaviya]] (on behalf of the other Hindus). The agreement gave reserved seats for the depressed classes in the Provisional legislatures, within the general electorate. Due to the pact, the depressed class received 148 seats in the legislature, instead of the 71 as allocated in the [[Communal Award]] earlier proposed by British Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. The text uses the term "Depressed Classes" to denote Untouchables among Hindus who were later called Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes under India Act 1935, and the later Indian Constitution of 1950.&lt;ref name="sharma2007"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=srDytmFE3KMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage|title=Introduction to the Constitution of India|work=google.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518222319/https://books.google.com/books?id=srDytmFE3KMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#v=onepage|archivedate=18 May 2015|df=dmy-all|isbn=9788120332461|last1=Sharma|last2=Sharma|first2=B.

In 1935, Ambedkar was appointed principal of the [[Government Law College, Bombay]], a position he held for two years. He also served as the chairman of Governing body of [[Ramjas College]], University of Delhi, after the death of its Founder Shri Rai Kedarnath.&lt;ref&gt;http://thecampusconnect.com/7-interesting-historical-facts-about-ramjas-college-university-of-delhi/{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Settling in Bombay (today called Mumbai), Ambedkar oversaw the construction of a house, and stocked his personal library with more than 50,000 books.&lt;ref name="Columbia5"&gt;{{cite web| last = Pritchett| first = Frances|url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1930s.html| title = In the 1930s| format = PHP| accessdate = 2 August 2006| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906055230/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/timeline/1930s.html| archivedate= 6 September 2006 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wife Ramabai died after a long illness the same year. It had been her long-standing wish to go on a pilgrimage to [[Pandharpur]], but Ambedkar had refused to let her go, telling her that he would create a new Pandharpur for her instead of Hinduism's Pandharpur which treated them as untouchables. At the Yeola Conversion Conference on 13 October in Nasik, Ambedkar announced his intention to convert to a different religion and exhorted his followers to leave [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref name="Columbia5"/&gt; He would repeat his message at many public meetings across India.

In 1936, Ambedkar founded the [[Independent Labour Party (India)|Independent Labour Party]], which contested the 1937 Bombay election to the [[Central Legislative Assembly]] for the 13 reserved and 4 general seats, and secured 11 and 3 seats respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffrelot |first1=Christophe |title=Dr Ambedkar and Untouchability: Analysing and Fighting Caste |year=2005 |publisher=C.

Ambedkar served on the Defence Advisory Committee&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffrelot |first1=Christophe |title=Dr Ambedkar and Untouchability: Analysing and Fighting Caste |year=2005 |publisher=C.

After the [[Lahore resolution]] (1940) of the Muslim League demanding Pakistan, Ambedkar wrote a 400-page tract titled ''Thoughts on Pakistan'', which analysed the concept of "Pakistan" in all its aspects. Ambedkar argued that the Hindus should concede Pakistan to the Muslims. He proposed that the provincial boundaries of Punjab and Bengal should be redrawn to separate the Muslim and non-Muslim majority parts. He thought the Muslims could have no objection to redrawing provincial boundaries. If they did, they did not quite "understand the nature of their own demand". Scholar Venkat Dhulipala states that ''Thoughts on Pakistan'' "rocked Indian politics for a decade". It determined the course of dialogue between the Muslim League and the Indian National Congress, paving the way for the [[Partition of India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Sialkoti |first=Zulfiqar Ali |title=An Analytical Study of the Punjab Boundary Line Issue during the Last Two Decades of the British Raj until the Declaration of 3 June 1947 |journal=Pakistan Journal of History and Culture |volume=XXXV |number=2 |year=2014 |url=http://www.nihcr.edu.pk/Latest_English_Journal/Pjhc%2035-2,%202014/4%20Punjab%20Boundary%20Line,%20Zulfiqar%20Ali.pdf |p=73–76 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180402094202/http://www.nihcr.edu.pk/Latest_English_Journal/Pjhc%2035-2,%202014/4%20Punjab%20Boundary%20Line,%20Zulfiqar%20Ali.pdf |archivedate=2 April 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Dhulipala |first=Venkat |title=Creating a New Medina |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Z6TBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR2 |date=2015 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-05212-3 |ref={{sfnref|Dhulipala, Creating a New Medina|2015}} |pp=124,&amp;nbsp;134,&amp;nbsp;142–144,&amp;nbsp;149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his work ''[[Who Were the Shudras?]]'', Ambedkar tried to explain the formation of untouchables. He saw Shudras and Ati Shudras who form the lowest caste in the ritual hierarchy of the [[Caste system in India|caste system]], as separate from Untouchables. Ambedkar oversaw the transformation of his political party into the [[Scheduled Castes Federation]], although it performed poorly in the 1946 elections for [[Constituent Assembly of India]]. Later he was elected into the constituent assembly of [[Bengal]] where [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]] was in power.&lt;ref name="Firstpost 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Attention BJP: When the Muslim League rescued Ambedkar from the 'dustbin of history' | website=Firstpost | date=15 April 2015 |url=http://www.firstpost.com/india/attention-sanghis-when-the-muslim-league-rescued-ambedkar-from-the-dustbin-of-history-2196678.html | accessdate=5 September 2015 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150920032027/http://www.firstpost.com/india/attention-sanghis-when-the-muslim-league-rescued-ambedkar-from-the-dustbin-of-history-2196678.html | archivedate=20 September 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambedkar contested in the Bombay North first Indian General Election of 1952, but lost to his former assistant and Congress Party candidate Narayan Kajrolkar. Ambedkar became a member of Rajya Sabha, probably an appointed member. He tried to enter Lok Sabha again in the by-election of 1954 from Bhandara, but he placed third (the Congress Party won). By the time of the second general election in 1957, Ambedkar had died.

Ambedkar also criticised Islamic practice in South Asia. While justifying the [[Partition of India]], he condemned child marriage and the mistreatment of women in Muslim society.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
No words can adequately express the great and many evils of polygamy and concubinage, and especially as a source of misery to a Muslim woman. Take the caste system. Everybody infers that Islam must be free from slavery and caste. [...] [While slavery existed], much of its support was derived from Islam and Islamic countries. While the prescriptions by the Prophet regarding the just and humane treatment of slaves contained in the Koran are praiseworthy, there is nothing whatever in Islam that lends support to the abolition of this curse. But if slavery has gone, caste among Musalmans [Muslims] has remained.&lt;ref name="Ambedkar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ambedkar|first=Bhimrao Ramji|title=Pakistan or the Partition of India|year=1946|publisher=Thackers Publishers|location=Bombay|chapter=Chapter X: Social Stagnation|chapterurl=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/410.html|pages=215–219|accessdate=8 October 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912185829/http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ambedkar/ambedkar_partition/410.html|archivedate=12 September 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Opposition to Aryan invasion theory==
Ambedkar viewed the [[Shudras]] as Aryan and adamantly rejected the [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|Aryan invasion theory]], describing it as "so absurd that it ought to have been dead long ago" in his 1946 book ''[[Who Were the Shudras?]]''.&lt;ref name="Bryant, Edwin 2001. pp. 50-51"/&gt;

Ambedkar viewed Shudras as originally being "part of the Kshatriya Varna in the Indo-Aryan society", but became socially degraded after they inflicted many tyrannies on [[Brahmins]].&lt;ref&gt;Bryant, Edwin. ''The Quest for the Origins of Vedic Culture'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001. pp. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arvind Sharma]], Ambedkar noticed certain flaws in the Aryan invasion theory that were later acknowledged by western scholarship. For example, scholars now acknowledge ''anās''  in [[Rig Veda]] 5.29.10 refers to speech rather than the shape of the [[Human nose|nose]].&lt;ref name="Sharma, Arvind 2005"&gt;Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''"Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 849.&lt;/ref&gt; Ambedkar anticipated this modern view by stating:

{{quote|The term ''Anasa'' occurs in Rig Veda V.29.10. What does the word mean? There are two interpretations. One is by Prof. Max Muller. The other is by Sayanacharya. According to Prof. Max Muller, it means 'one without nose' or 'one with a flat nose' and has as such been relied upon as a piece of evidence in support of the view that the Aryans were a separate race from the Dasyus. Sayanacharya says that it means 'mouthless,' i.e., devoid of good speech. This difference of meaning is due to difference in the correct reading of the word ''Anasa''. Sayanacharya reads it as ''an-asa'' while Prof. Max Muller reads it as ''a-nasa''. As read by Prof. Max Muller, it means 'without nose.' Question is : which of the two readings is the correct one? There is no reason to hold that Sayana's reading is wrong. On the other hand there is everything to suggest that it is right. In the first place, it does not make non-sense of the word. Secondly, as there is no other place where the Dasyus are described as noseless, there is no reason why the word should be read in such a manner as to give it an altogether new sense. It is only fair to read it as a synonym of ''Mridhravak''. There is therefore no evidence in support of the conclusion that the Dasyus belonged to a different race.&lt;ref name="Sharma, Arvind 2005"/&gt;}}

Ambedkar disputed various hypotheses of the Aryan homeland being [[Indo-Aryan migration theory|outside India]], and concluded the Aryan homeland was India itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''"Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 851.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ambedkar, the Rig Veda says Aryans, Dāsa and Dasyus were competing religious groups, not different peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Sharma, Arvind (2005), ''"Dr. B. R. Ambedkar on the Aryan Invasion and the Emergence of the Caste System in India"'', J Am Acad Relig (September 2005) 73 (3): 854-5, 863.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Drafting India's Constitution==

Upon India's independence on 15 August 1947, the new Congress-led government invited Ambedkar to serve as the nation's first Law Minister, which he accepted. On 29 August, he was appointed Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, and was appointed by the Assembly to write India's new Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some Facts of Constituent Assembly |work=Parliament of India |publisher=National Informatics Centre |url=http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/debates/facts.htm |quote=On 29 August 1947, the Constituent Assembly set up an Drafting Committee under the Chairmanship of B.

[[Granville Austin]] described the [[Indian Constitution]] drafted by Ambedkar as 'first and foremost a social document'. 'The majority of India's constitutional provisions are either directly arrived at furthering the aim of social revolution or attempt to foster this revolution by establishing conditions necessary for its achievement.'&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=Oxford University Press |title = The Indian Constitution: Cornerstone of a Nation |first= Granville |last= Austin |year = 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text prepared by Ambedkar provided constitutional guarantees and protections for a wide range of [[civil liberties]] for individual citizens, including freedom of religion, the abolition of untouchability, and the outlawing of all forms of discrimination. Ambedkar argued for extensive economic and social rights for women, and won the Assembly's support for introducing a system of [[reservation in India|reservations]] of jobs in the civil services, schools and colleges for members of [[Scheduled Castes and Tribes|scheduled castes]] and [[scheduled tribe]]s and [[Other Backward Class]], a system akin to [[affirmative action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Constituent Assembly Debates Clause wise Discussion on the Draft Constitution 15th November 1948 to 8th January 1949|url=http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/63B3.CA%20Debates%2015.11.1948%20to%208.1.1949%20Part%20III.htm|accessdate= 12 January 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524143208/http://www.ambedkar.org/ambcd/63B3.CA%20Debates%2015.11.1948%20to%208.1.1949%20Part%20III.htm|archivedate= 24 May 2013|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's lawmakers hoped to eradicate the socio-economic inequalities and lack of opportunities for India's depressed classes through these measures.&lt;ref name=Sheth&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheth|first=D.

===Opposition to Article 370===
Ambedkar opposed [[Article 370]] of the Constitution of India, which granted a special status to the State of Jammu and Kashmir, and which was included against his wishes. [[Balraj Madhok]] reportedly said, Ambedkar had clearly told the Kashmiri leader, [[Sheikh Abdullah]]: "You wish India should protect your borders, she should build roads in your area, she should supply you food grains, and Kashmir should get equal status as India. But Government of India should have only limited powers and Indian people should have no rights in Kashmir. To give consent to this proposal, would be a treacherous thing against the interests of India and I, as the Law Minister of India, will never do it." Then Sk. Abdullah approached Nehru, who directed him to Gopal Swami Ayyangar, who in turn approached Sardar Patel, saying Nehru had promised Sk. Abdullah the special status. Patel got the Article passed while Nehru was on a foreign tour. On the day the article came up for discussion, Ambedkar did not reply to questions on it but did participate on other articles. All arguments were done by Krishna Swami Ayyangar.&lt;ref name=Jamanadas&gt;{{cite web |last=amanadas |first=Dr. K. |title=Kashmir Problem From Ambedkarite Perspective |url=http://www.ambedkar.org/jamanadas/KashmirProblem1.htm |publisher=ambedkar.org |accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004225153/http://www.ambedkar.org/jamanadas/KashmirProblem1.htm |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sehgal|first=Narender|title=Converted Kashmir: Memorial of Mistakes|year=1994|publisher=Utpal Publications|location=Delhi|url=http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter26.html|accessdate=17 September 2013|chapter=Chapter 26: Article 370|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905070936/http://www.kashmir-information.com/ConvertedKashmir/Chapter26.html|archivedate=5 September 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tilak |title=Why Ambedkar refused to draft Article 370 |url=http://india.indymedia.org/en/2003/08/6710.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040207095529/http://www.india.indymedia.org/en/2003/08/6710.shtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 February 2004 |publisher=Indymedia India |accessdate=17 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambedkar's first wife Ramabai died in 1935 after a long illness. After completing the draft of India's constitution in the late 1940s, he suffered from lack of sleep, had [[neuropathic pain]] in his legs, and was taking [[insulin]] and homoeopathic medicines. He went to Bombay for treatment, and there met Dr. Sharada Kabir, whom he married on 15 April 1948, at his home in New Delhi. She was 39 year old and he was 57.

Ambedkar considered converting to [[Sikhism]], which encouraged opposition to oppression and so appealed to leaders of scheduled castes.

[[File:Pax cultura.svg|thumb|right|Banner of Peace sign]]

The '''banner of peace''' is a symbol of the [[Roerich Pact]]. This pact is the first international treaty dedicated to the protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscbs.org/1935-roerich-pact.html Roerich Pact: Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments]&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed on April 15, 1935. The banner of peace was proposed by [[Nicholas Roerich]] for an international pact for the protection of culture values.

== Description ==
Roerich described the sign thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[the] proposed banner is the symbol of whole world, not a country, but the whole civilized world. The Banner proposed has on the white background three united amaranth spheres as a symbol of Eternity and Unity. Although we don't know when this Banner will fly over all cultural monuments but undoubtedly the seed has been sprouted. Already it attracts the attention of great intellects and is directed from one heart to another, awaking the idea of Peace and Benevolence among peoples."&lt;ref name="r2"&gt;"Banner of Peace." ''Collected articles''. Moscow: International Centre of the Roerichs, 1995. P. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We are asked to collect where the signs of our Banner of Peace are. The sign of trinity is found scattered around the whole world. Now anybody can explain it by various ways. One says that it is the past, present and future united by the circle of eternity. Others explain it as a religion, knowledge and art in the circle of culture."&lt;ref name="r2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The following description of the sign appears in the official text of the pact:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/ART/325-480004?OpenDocument Treaty on the Protection of Artistic and Scientific Institutions and Historic Monuments (Roerich Pact). Washington, 15 April 1935. Art. 3]&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In order to identify the monuments and institutions mentioned in article I, use may be made of a distinctive flag (red circle with a triple red sphere in the circle on a white background) in accordance with the model attached to this treaty."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Origin ==
In the text of the pact, Roerich wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Banner of Peace, as is now well-known, is the symbol of the Roerich Pact. This great humanitarian ideal provides in the field of mankind's cultural achievements the same guardianship as the Red Cross provides in alleviating the physical sufferings of man."&lt;ref&gt;"Aims and History." ''The Roerich Pact and Banner of Peace''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The origin of Roerich's idea for the creation of the Banner of Peace sign was an ancient [[Russian icon]] by [[Andrei Rublev]]. Roerich wrote about this in his letter to Baron M.A. Taube: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"At last I can send you a home photo of my last picture dedicated to meaning sense of the banner sign. You can show this photo to some committee members and also to anybody whom, as you believe, it may be useful. Say to all ignoramuses which try to substitute their self-interested and ill-intentioned explanations of the sense of this picture. What may be more ancient and more genuine than Byzantine conception which stretches in the depth of centuries to the origin united Christianity and so beautifully implemented in Rublev's icon "Saint life-giving Trinity" from the Holy Trinity-St. Sergius Lavra? Just this symbol – the symbol of ancient Christianity, consecrated for us by name of St. Sergius, gives me a hint to our sign. Its sense is expressed on the proposed photo with conservation of all elements and their positions according to the Rublev's icon. Let this photo will be with You at Paris in the case of any new attempts to destroy already existing. In addition, I send You a photo of St. Queen of the Banner – Madonna Oriflamma." (Letter from N.K. Roerich to Baron M. Taube, 13.02.1932.)&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

N.K. Roerich has adduced the following illustrations of presence of the Banner of Peace components in the pictures and icons of great spiritual devotees from various religions:{{clarify|date=June 2013}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Our post from various countries today brings us much news about the propagation of our Pact for protection of cultural values. We have received a copy of an ancient icon of St Nicholas the Miracle-Worker &lt;…&gt;, which is confirmed to printing by metropolitan Antony. From other regions we have received a photo of an edition of Kiev-Pecherskaya Laura press from 1860 of the service to Venerable Sergius of Radonezh, the Miracle-Worker. From Spain we have received a picture of St. Domingo from "Silos" (archaeological museum, Madrid). Also from Spain we have received a picture of St. Michael made by Bartolommeo Vermekho (1440). At all these pictures the sign of Banner of Peace can be seen. It is useful to remember this for many."&lt;ref&gt;Roerich, N.K. Diary pages. V.1. "Half century."&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The sign of the banner was also found at the Temple of Heaven.  "Tamga" of Tamerlane consists of the same sign. The sign of Three Treasures is well known for many countries of the East. On the chest of Tibetan women one can see a large fibula which is the sign. The same fibulas we see also in Caucasian findings and in Scandinavia. Madonna of Strasbourg has the same sign as well as the Spanish Saints. The same sign is on the icons of St. Sergius and St. Nicholas Miracle-Worker. The sign as a large breast fibula is depicted on Christ's breast on the well-known H. Memling's picture. When we go over sacramental pictures of Byzantine, Roma, the same symbol ties the sacramental pictures on over the world."&lt;ref&gt;Roerich, N.K. Diary pages. V.1. "The signs."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Conditions of using the banner of peace sign ==
The monuments and institutions, on which the banner of peace sign is proposed to establish, must be included by National governments in the special list. 

'''ARTICLE IV'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;The signatory Governments and those which accede to this treaty, shall send to the Pan American Union, at the time of signature or accession, or at any time thereafter, a list of the monuments and institutions for which they desire the protection agreed to in this treaty. The Pan American Union, when notifying the Governments of signatures or accessions, shall also send the list of monuments and institutions mentioned in this article, and shall inform the other Governments of any changes in said list.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

'''ARTICLE V'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;The monuments and institutions mentioned in article I shall cease to enjoy the privileges recognized in the present treaty in case they are made use of for military purposes.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Roerich wrote about these conditions:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Institutions, collections and missions, registered under [[Roerich Pact]], exhibit a distinctive flag which gives them the right to special protection and respect from belligerent countries and peoples of all countries participating in the treaty."&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

It is seen from above words that in order to get the right for exhibition of the distinctive banner one must be registered by Pact bodies. The same standing exists concerning a distinctive banner of [[Red Cross]] (which also created on the basis of ancient symbol – cross).

== Important cultural events with the Banner of Peace ==
In 1990, Russian cosmonauts [[Aleksandr Nikolayevich Balandin|Aleksandr Balandin]] and [[Anatoly Solovyev]] performed a space flight on orbital station [[Mir]] with the banner of peace on board. [[Mir EO-6|This flight]] lasted from February to August, including nine days with the banner outside the craft, completing 144 orbits of the Earth.&lt;ref name="r7"&gt;{{cite web| title= Banner of Peace hall |url= http://en.icr.su/museum/layout/banner/03.php |publisher= International Centre of the Roerichs |accessdate= 3 November 2017 |page= 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An international scientific "banner of peace" project was conducted in 1997, with the banner of peace again delivered into the orbiting Mir. The aim of this action was to call for protecting life and beauty on Earth. Many international crews worked in Mir with the banner aboard. Cosmonaut Paul Vinogradov, a participant of the project, said: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"We have raised the banner of peace over the Earth in order that a space of culture excludes the space of war and animosity forever. We call all the peoples and nations to building of new spiritual, scientific and artistic cooperation."&lt;ref name="r7"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After completing the project and returning from orbit, the banner of peace was passed to the International Centre of the Roerichs. It is now exhibited there. 

On January 5, 1999, the banner of peace was presented to President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] of [[Kazakhstan]]. Space pilot A.A. Leonov and professor S.P. Kapitsa participated in the ceremony, which was conducted in the Presidential Palace in [[Almaty]].&lt;ref&gt;"Museum named after N.K. Roerich." ''Museum guide''. Moscow: International Centre of the Roerichs, Master-Bank, 2006. P. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Mountaineering|Mountaineers]] have lifted the banner of peace over many mountain peaks. Among these are the following:
: - [[Elbrus]];&lt;ref name="r9"&gt;Presentation of Banner of Peace to President of Kazakh Republic N.A.Nazarbayev. (shorthand record). / Journal “New Epoch. Problems. Searches. Studies” N 2(21), 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
: - [[Belukha]], Roerich peak, Urusvati peak, Svetoslav Roerich peak (Altai);&lt;ref name="r9" /&gt;
: - [[Khan Tengri|Khan-Tengri]] (Middle Asia) ;
: - [[Everest]] ([[Himalayas]])

The banner of peace was first raised at the [[North Pole]] by the famous traveler [[Fyodor Konyukhov]] in 1988.  In 1999, participants of the first international complex Antarctic expedition "Towards to XXI" raised the banner of peace at the [[South Pole]]. The banners from these expeditions are now exhibited in the International Centre of the Roerichs.&lt;ref name="r7" /&gt;

In October, 2004 during the celebration of Roerich's 100th anniversary, the banner of peace which had been to the space station was presented to the Indian Parliament. Taking the banner, Speaker S. Chatterji said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"It will be kept in the library of Indian Parliament as most precious treasure."&lt;ref&gt;Martovitskaya, M. "Banner of Peace on the earth, in mountains and at the orbit". ''Culture'', No. 14, April 14–20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Brewer–Dobson circulation''' is a [[Model (abstract)|model]] of atmospheric circulation, proposed by [[Alan West Brewer|Alan Brewer]] in 1949 and [[Gordon Dobson]] in 1956, which attempts to explain why tropical air has less [[ozone]] than polar air, even though the tropical [[stratosphere]] is where most atmospheric ozone is produced. It is a simple circulation model that posits the existence of a slow [[Air current|current]] in the winter [[Sphere|hemisphere]] which redistributes air from the tropics to the extratropics.  The Brewer–Dobson circulation is driven by [[atmospheric waves]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/1520-0469%281990%29047%3C0392%3AOTGEOM%3E2.0.CO%3B2 | title= On the Global Exchange of Mass between the Stratosphere and Troposphere|author = J.R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2893">The '''Canadian Ecology Centre (CEC)''' is an [[outdoor education]] complex located within [[Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park]], near the town of [[Mattawa, Ontario]].

== Basic Description ==
The Canadian Ecology Centre site consists of a main building and several smaller cabins on a tract of land within Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park. The CEC is a non-profit organization and was initially supported by proponents within the [[logging]] and [[wood]] industries, such as [[Tembec]], as well as by various levels of government, [[NGO]]s, and public donors to get the Centre off the ground. The CEC facilities, while contemporary in both age and design, are constructed almost entirely out of wood.

The CEC is primarily an educational and research centre, where courses on a wide variety of subjects ranging from local culture and history to biology and science to forestry management and mining are offered to the public. The site is also equipped with high-speed internet access, and can be rented out as a wedding venue, conference or meeting centre. Cabins can also be rented for a nightly rate as an alternative to "tenting it" in the park.

The centre, like much of the surrounding communities, is almost fully [[bilingual]] and offers most programs in [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].

The CEC is also the  headquarters  for the [[Canadian Institute of Forestry]].

== High School Credit Courses ==
By far the best-known aspect of the CEC, however, is Eco-Camp, which is a summer program offering academic credit to high school students. Formal two-week courses in subjects such as Science, Biology, Environmental Science and Geography are available. The program is residential, and students live on-site for the duration. The most popular programs, a grade 11 and 12 biology courses, are almost invariably booked solid even with two back-to-back offerings of the course.

== Professional Development and Teacher Tours ==
The CEC offers a variety of Professional Development opportunities throughout the year, including the summer months.  Take part in single or multi-day programs that are designed and developed to provide hands-on, informative and engaging learning opportunities as well as opportunities to network with professionals and receive great resources and experiences that will transform and enhance career goals and personal development.

Training and certifications are available for professionals in a variety of fields and areas of interest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12482">'''Chemogenetics''' is the processes by which [[macromolecule]]s can be engineered to interact with previously unrecognized small molecules. Chemogenetics as a term was originally coined to describe the observed effects of mutations on [[chalcone isomerase]] activity on substrate specificities in the flowers of ''[[Dianthus caryophyllus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Forkmann G, Dangelmayr B | title = Genetic control of chalcone isomerase activity in flowers of Dianthus caryophyllus | journal = Biochemical Genetics | volume = 18 | issue = 5-6 | pages = 519–27 | date = June 1980 | pmid = 7437010 | doi = 10.1007/bf00484399 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is very similar to [[optogenetics]] however, it uses chemically engineered molecules and ligands instead of light and light-sensitive channels known as [[Opsin]]s.

In recent research projects, chemogenetics has been widely used to understand the relationship between brain activity and behavior. Prior to chemogenetics, researchers used methods such as [[Transcranial magnetic stimulation|transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)]] and [[Deep brain stimulation|deep brain stimulation (DBS)]] to study the relationship between neuronal activity and behavior.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dobrzanski G, Kossut M | title = Application of the DREADD technique in biomedical brain research | journal = Pharmacological Reports | volume = 69 | issue = 2 | pages = 213–221 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28092807 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharep.2016.10.015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison to optogenetics ==
[[Optogenetics]] and chemogenetics are the more recent and popular methods used to study this relationship. Both of these methods target specific brain circuits and cell population to influence cell activity. However, they use different procedures to accomplish this task. Optogenetics uses light-sensitive channels and pumps that are virally introduced into neurons. Cells' activity, having these channels, can then be manipulated by light. Chemogenetics, on the other hand, uses chemically engineered receptors and exogenous molecules specific for those receptors, to affect the activity of those cells. The engineered macromolecules used to design these receptors include [[Nucleic acid hybridization|nucleic acid hybrids]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strobel SA, Ortoleva-Donnelly L, Ryder SP, Cate JH, Moncoeur E | title = Complementary sets of noncanonical base pairs mediate RNA helix packing in the group I intron active site | journal = Nature Structural Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 60–6 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9437431 | doi = 10.1038/nsb0198-60 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[kinase]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bishop AC, Shah K, Liu Y, Witucki L, Kung C, Shokat KM | title = Design of allele-specific inhibitors to probe protein kinase signaling | journal = Current Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 257–66 | date = February 1998 | pmid = 9501066 | doi = 10.1016/s0960-9822(98)70198-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; variety of [[Metabolism|metabolic enzymes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Collot J, Gradinaru J, Humbert N, Skander M, Zocchi A, Ward TR | title = Artificial metalloenzymes for enantioselective catalysis based on biotin-avidin | journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society | volume = 125 | issue = 30 | pages = 9030–1 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 15369356 | doi = 10.1021/ja035545i }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Häring D, Distefano MD | title = Enzymes by design: chemogenetic assembly of transamination active sites containing lysine residues for covalent catalysis | journal = Bioconjugate Chemistry | volume = 12 | issue = 3 | pages = 385–90 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11353536 | doi = 10.1021/bc000117c }}&lt;/ref&gt; and G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) such as [[Receptor activated solely by a synthetic ligand|DREADDs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Strader CD, Gaffney T, Sugg EE, Candelore MR, Keys R, Patchett AA, Dixon RA | title = Allele-specific activation of genetically engineered receptors | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 266 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–8 | date = January 1991 | pmid = 1670767 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coward P, Wada HG, Falk MS, Chan SD, Meng F, Akil H, Conklin BR | title = Controlling signaling with a specifically designed Gi-coupled receptor | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 95 | issue = 1 | pages = 352–7 | date = January 1998 | pmid = 9419379 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.95.1.352 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0223-5234(99)80094-4 |title=Engineering a region of bulk tolerance in the 5-HT2A receptor |journal=European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=441–447 |year=1999 |last1=Westkaemper |first1=Richard B |last2=Hyde |first2=Edward G |last3=Choudhary |first3=Mohammad S |last4=Khan |first4=Naseem |last5=Gelbar |first5=Edward I |last6=Glennon |first6=Richard A |last7=Roth |first7=Bryan L | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Armbruster BN, Li X, Pausch MH, Herlitze S, Roth BL | title = Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 12 | pages = 5163–8 | date = March 2007 | pmid = 17360345 | pmc = 1829280 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0700293104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

DREADDs are the most common [[G protein–coupled receptor|GPCRs]] used in chemogenetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roth BL | title = DREADDs for Neuroscientists | journal = Neuron | volume = 89 | issue = 4 | pages = 683–94 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26889809 | pmc = 4759656 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2016.01.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These receptors solely get activated by the drug of interest (inert molecule) and influence physiological and neural processes that take place within and outside of the central nervous system.

Chemogenetics has recently been favored over Optogenetics, and it avoids some of the challenges of Optogenetics. Chemogenetics does not require the expensive light equipment, and therefore, is more accessible. The resolution in Optogenetic declines due to light scattering and illuminance declined levels as the distance between the subject and the light source increases.These factors, therefore, don’t allow for all cells to be affected by light and lead to a lower spatial resolution. Chemogenetics, however, does not require light usage and therefore can achieve a higher spatial resolution.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Montgomery KL, Yeh AJ, Ho JS, Tsao V, Mohan Iyer S, Grosenick L, Ferenczi EA, Tanabe Y, Deisseroth K, Delp SL, Poon AS | title = Wirelessly powered, fully internal optogenetics for brain, spinal and peripheral circuits in mice | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 12 | issue = 10 | pages = 969–74 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26280330 | pmc = 5507210 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.3536 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
GPCRs' usage and chemogenetics are nowadays the targets for many of the pharmaceutical companies to cure and alleviate symptoms of diseases that involve all tissues of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Smith RS, Hu R, DeSouza A, Eberly CL, Krahe K, Chan W, Araneda RC | title = Differential Muscarinic Modulation in the Olfactory Bulb | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 35 | issue = 30 | pages = 10773–85 | date = July 2015 | pmid = 26224860 | pmc = 4518052 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0099-15.2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, DREADDs have been used to explore treatment options for various neurodegenerative and psychological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, depression, anxiety, and addiction. These aforementioned conditions involve processes that occur within and outside of the nervous system involving neurotransmitters such as [[Gamma-Aminobutyric acid|GABA]] and [[Glutamic acid|Glutamate]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Volkow ND, Koob GF, McLellan AT | title = Neurobiologic Advances from the Brain Disease Model of Addiction | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 374 | issue = 4 | pages = 363–71 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26816013 | doi = 10.1056/nejmra1511480 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemogenetics has therefore been used in pharmacology to adjust the levels of such neurotransmitters in specific neuron while minimizing the side effects of treatment. To treat and relieve the symptoms of any disease using the DREADDs, these receptors are delivered to the area of interest via viral transduction.

Recently some studies have considered using a new method called retro DREADDs. This method allows specific neuronal pathways to be studied under cellular resolution. Unlike classic DREADDs, this method is usually used in wild type animals, and these receptors are given to the targeted cells via injection of two viral vectors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Animal Models ===
DREADDS have been used in many animal models (e.g., mice and other non-primate animals) to target and influence the activity of various cells . Chemogenetics used in animals assists with demonstrating human disease models such as [[Parkinson's disease]]. Having this information allows scientists understand whether viral expression of DREADD proteins, both in-vivo enhancers and inhibitors of neuronal function can be used to bidirectionally affect the behaviors and the activity of the involved neurons. Recent studies have shown that DREADDs were successfully used to treat the motor deficits of rats modeling Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pienaar IS, Gartside SE, Sharma P, De Paola V, Gretenkord S, Withers D, Elson JL, Dexter DT | title = Pharmacogenetic stimulation of cholinergic pedunculopontine neurons reverses motor deficits in a rat model of Parkinson's disease | journal = Molecular Neurodegeneration | volume = 10 | pages = 47 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26394842 | pmc = 4580350 | doi = 10.1186/s13024-015-0044-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have had successes linking the usage of DREADDs and influencing drug seeking and drug sensitization behavior.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The progression of Chemogenetics from rodents to non-human primates has been slow due to increased demand in time and expense surrounding these projects.However, some recent studies in 2016 have been able to demonstrate successes showing that silencing the activity of neurons in the [[Orbitofrontal cortex]] along with the removal of [[Rhinal cortex]], restricted the reward task performance in macaques.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Galvan A, Caiola MJ, Albaugh DL | title = Advances in optogenetic and chemogenetic methods to study brain circuits in non-human primates | journal = Journal of Neural Transmission | volume = 125 | issue = 3 | pages = 547–563 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 28238201 | pmc = 5572535 | doi = 10.1007/s00702-017-1697-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitation and future directions ==
Chemogenetics and usage of DREADDs have allowed researchers to advance in biomedical research areas including many [[Neurodegeneration|neurodegenerative]] and psychiatric conditions. Chemogenetics have been used in these fields to induce specific and reversible brain lesions and therefore, study specific activities of neuron population. Although Chemogenetics offers specificity and high spatial resolution, it still faces some challenges when used in investigating [[Neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatric]] disorders. Neuropsychiatric disorders usually have a complex nature where lesions in the brain have not been identified as the main cause. Chemogenetics has been used to reverse some of the deficits revolving such conditions however, it hasn’t been able to identify the main cause of neuropsychiatric diseases and cure these conditions completely due to complex nature of these conditions. Nevertheless, chemogenetics has been used successfully in a preclinical model of drug-resistant [[Gene therapy for epilepsy|epilepsy]], where seizures arise from a discrete part of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kätzel D, Nicholson E, Schorge S, Walker MC, Kullmann DM | title = Chemical-genetic attenuation of focal neocortical seizures | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 5 | pages = 3847 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24866701 | pmc = 4050272 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms4847 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2138">'''Codex Hierosolymitanus''' (also called the '''Bryennios manuscript''' or the '''Jerusalem Codex''', often designated simply "'''H'''" in scholarly discourse) is an 11th-century Greek manuscript, written by an otherwise unknown scribe named Leo, who dated it 1056. Its designation of "Jerusalem" recalls its resting place in [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]], at the library of the monastery of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].

The [[codex]] contains the ''[[Didache]]'', the ''[[Epistle of Barnabas]]'', the [[First Epistle of Clement]] and the [[Second Epistle of Clement]], the long version of the [[letters of Ignatius of Antioch]] and a [[Biblical canon|list of books of the Bible]] following the order of [[John Chrysostom]]. It was discovered in 1873 by [[Philotheos Bryennios]], the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[Nicomedia]], at [[Constantinople]]. He published the texts of the two familiar [[Epistles of Clement]] in 1875, overlooking the ''Didache'', which he found when he returned to the manuscript.

[[Adolf Hilgenfeld]] used ''Codex Hierosolymitanus'' for his first printed edition of the previously all-but-unknown ''Didache'' in 1877.

'''The College of Wooster''' is a private [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Wooster, Ohio]]. It is primarily known for its emphasis on mentored undergraduate research and enrolls approximately 2,000 students. Founded in 1866 by the [[Presbyterian]] Church as the University of Wooster, it officially has been non-sectarian since 1969, when ownership ties with the Presbyterian Church ended. From its creation, the college has been a [[coeducation|co-educational]] institution. The school is a member of The [[Five Colleges of Ohio]], [[Great Lakes Colleges Association]], and the [[Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities]]. As of December 31, 2017, Wooster's endowment stood at $311 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wooster.edu/about/facts&lt;/ref&gt;

Wooster is one of forty colleges named in [[Loren Pope]]'s book ''[[Colleges That Change Lives]]'', in which he called it his "original best-kept secret in higher education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Loren |last=Pope |title=Colleges that Change Lives |url=http://www.ctcl.com/colleges/wooster/index.htm |publisher=ctcl.com |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128203814/http://www.ctcl.com/colleges/wooster/index.htm |archivedate=2006-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is consistently ranked among the nation's top liberal arts colleges, according to [[U.S. News and World Report]].  In US News' "Best Colleges 2018", for the sixteenth year in a row, Wooster is recognized for its “outstanding” undergraduate research opportunities and its senior capstone program, the  {{small|I.S.}} (Independent Study). 

==History==
[[File:University of Wooster, Ohio, c1867.jpg|thumb|200px|left|University of Wooster, lithograph, c1867]]
Founded as '''The University of Wooster''' in 1866 by [[Presbyterians]], the institution opened its doors in 1870 with a faculty of five and a student body of thirty men and four women. Wealthy Wooster citizen Ephraim Quinby donated the first {{convert|22|acre}}, a large oak grove situated on a hilltop overlooking the town.  After being founded with the intent to make Wooster open to everyone, the university's first Ph.D. was granted to a woman, Annie B. Irish, in 1882.  The first black student, Clarence Allen, began his studies later in the same decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wooster.edu/About-Wooster/History-Traditions|title=Official website: Our history &amp; traditions|accessdate=2011-08-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826055604/http://www.wooster.edu/About-Wooster/History-Traditions|archivedate=2011-08-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is rumored that when the college was founded, it was gifted a mummy &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-daily-record.com/living/2005/09/18/egyptian-mummy-is-the-centerpiece-of-college-of-wooster-art-exhibit| title=Egyptian Mummy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the head of [[Nat Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianapolismonthly.com/longform/skullduggery-nat-turner-skull/| title=Mystery of Nat Turner's missing head}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the mummy is still located on campus, at the basement of the art center, the head of Nat Turner was lost in Old Main after a fire broke out.

In the pre-dawn hours of December 11, 1901, a fire destroyed the five-story Old Main building, the centerpiece of the campus.  Within two years, it was replaced by several new buildings which (after substantial renovations within the last 30 years) remain the primary structures for the classes, labs, and faculty offices.  These include Kauke Hall (the center of campus), Scovel Hall, Severance Hall (which together form a large courtyard in front of Kauke Hall), and Taylor Hall.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

About ten years after the fire and rebuilding, there were eight divisions, including a medical school whose faculty outnumbered those in the college of arts and sciences. However, the university had gradually begun to define itself as a liberal arts institution and, in 1915, after a bitter dispute between the faculty and the Trustees, chose to become The College of Wooster in order to devote itself entirely to the education of undergraduate students in the liberal arts. The enrollment of the college is kept intentionally small, around 2000 students, to allow for close interaction between faculty and students.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

In the 1920s, during the [[Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy|clashes between liberal and fundamentalists]], [[William Jennings Bryan]], a prominent Presbyterian layman, and former [[United States Secretary of State]], attacked the college for its teaching of evolution. The subject had been taught at the college for several decades and defended by then president [[Charles F. Wishart]]. Bryan called for the General Assembly of the church to cut off funding to the college. But in 1923 Wishart defeated Bryan for the position of [[Moderator of the General Assembly]] largely on the evolution issue, and the college continued to teach evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last =Tait |first = L. Gordon |authorlink = |title =Evolution: Wishart, Wooster, and William Jennings Bryan |journal =Journal of Presbyterian History|volume =62 |issue = 4 |pages =310–314 |publisher = |location = |date =1984 |language = |jstor = 23328648 |issn = |doi = |ref= none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|240|acre|ha|adj=on}} college has a tree endowment, established in 1987, which supports tree conservation, maintenance, and a tree replacement program.   The Oak Grove, a pleasant green space near the center of campus, plays host to commencement ceremonies each May.  Several of the Grove's trees are older than the college itself, including an eastern black oak near Galpin Hall that dates to 1681, as well as a 1766 white oak.  Each senior class plants a class tree in the Oak Grove on the day before graduation.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}}

On November 10, 2015, the College named [[Sarah Bolton (physicist)|Sarah Bolton]] as its 12th president, and first female president. Her term began July 1, 2016. Bolton was a dean and physics professor at [[Williams College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Sarah Bolton named 12th president of The College of Wooster {{!}} The College of Wooster |url=http://wooster.edu/news/releases/2015/november/president-bolton/ |website=wooster.edu |accessdate=2015-12-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202181205/http://wooster.edu/news/releases/2015/november/president-bolton/ |dead-url=no |archivedate=2015-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
[[Image:COWkaukehall.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Kauke Hall is the main academic building on campus]]
Upon completion of at least 32 courses, students may earn a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Music Education degree.

In addition to the programs listed below, students may design their own major with approval from the [[Registrar (education)|registrar]] and the Provost. Some of the pre-professional programs are cooperative ones in which students spend a certain period of time at the College of Wooster before transferring to accelerated courses at other colleges and universities.

===Independent Study program===
The College of Wooster also has an Independent Study program, in which all students work one-on-one with a faculty advisor to complete a written [[thesis]] or other significant project during the course of the senior year, usually about 50 to 100 pages in length.&lt;ref name=twsAprWab&gt;{{cite news
 |author=

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student also presents an oral defense of the thesis before a faculty committee.  The program, begun in 1947 by Howard Lowry (the college's 7th President), has received attention from other colleges and universities, and a number of other institutions have modeled programs after it. In 2003, the independent study program at Wooster was recognized by ''[[US News and World Report]]'' as the second best 'senior capstone experience' in the US, behind only [[Princeton University]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}.  Wooster ranks 14th in the United States among independent colleges whose graduates earned Ph.D.s between 1920 and 1995 (according to the Baccalaureate Origins of Doctorate Recipients, 1998).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://server1.fandm.edu/departments/CollegeRelations/BacOrigins/bacorigins.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2005-10-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041215122033/http://server1.fandm.edu/departments/CollegeRelations/BacOrigins/bacorigins.html |archivedate=December 15, 2004 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Preparation and completion of the thesis can be time consuming, and led to one view in which a student, writing in the weekly ''The Wooster Voice'', suggested that the independent study program be interwoven with career planning as well as applications to graduate schools.&lt;ref name=twsAprWtr&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Special traditions have been developed surrounding Independent Study. Upon completion, a student receives a yellow button saying 'I did it!' as well as the highly coveted [[Tootsie Roll]].&lt;ref name=twsAprWab/&gt; The tradition began in 1974&lt;ref name=twsAprWab/&gt; when the registrar at the time, Lee Culp (also a graduate of the College of Wooster), gave out candy along with the buttons one year; the Tootsie Roll itself was chosen simply because it was cheap to buy in bulk. Beginning in 1989, buttons were given out to indicate the order in which theses had been handed in.&lt;ref name=twsAprWab/&gt; The 'due date,' or the last day that students can turn in their completed Independent Study project, is the first Monday after spring break. On I.S. Monday, the [[pipe band]] strikes up including drums and trumpets,&lt;ref name=twsAprWab/&gt; and with the Provost leading the way, the seniors march through the Kauke Arch in a jubilant parade, described by one professor as a "celebration of both scholarship and survival", ending at Kittredge dining hall, where a celebratory dinner with advisors and college administrators follows.

===Libraries===
The College of Wooster Libraries consists of three branches (Andrews Library, The Flo K. Gault Library and The Timken Science Library in Frick Hall) and a music library located at the Scheide Music Center. Andrews Library, the largest library in the system, houses more than 850,000 volumes and can accommodate over 500 readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Andrews Library - College of Wooster Campus Tour |url=http://www3.wooster.edu/admissions/campustour/library.php |publisher=Wooster.edu |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060909181328/http://www.wooster.edu/admissions/campustour/library.php |archivedate=2006-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrews Library houses the college's Special Collections, media library and the student writing center. The Flo K. Gault Library, built as an addition to Andrews Library in 1995, primarily serves as a place for class seniors to work on their Independent Study projects. The Gault Library contains carrels devoted to Independent Study for every senior student of the humanities and social sciences. The Timken Science Library in Frick Hall (1900, 1998), which is the oldest branch in the system, served as the original academic library for the college from 1900 to 1962. After three decades as an art museum, the building reopened as the science library in 1998, with substantial funding from the Timken Foundation of Canton, Ohio, and now primarily serves students in the math and sciences departments. The library provides Independent Study carrels for math and science seniors.

* '''CONSORT:''' The College of Wooster became a founding member of the Five Colleges of Ohio Consortium in 1996. The College of Wooster merged its library catalogue with [[Denison University]], [[Kenyon College]] and [[Ohio Wesleyan University]] to form the [[CONSORT Colleges|CONSORT]] library system. The CONSORT library system provides its patrons access to the combined holdings of all four colleges.
* '''OhioLINK:''' CONSORT is a member of [[OhioLINK]], a statewide consortium of academic libraries as well as the State Library of Ohio, which agreed to make their collections available to library patrons within this network. CONSORT's membership into OhioLink gives its patrons immediate access to a collection of books, online journals and databases that rivals the largest academic libraries in the country. The OhioLINK catalogue represents 89 libraries in the state and lists nearly 11.5 million unique titles from total holdings of 48 million items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is OhioLINK |url=http://www.ohiolink.edu/about/what-is-ol.html |publisher=Ohiolink.edu |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206205827/http://www.ohiolink.edu/about/what-is-ol.html |archivedate=2012-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art Museum===
The College of Wooster Art Museum was established in the 1930s as a small gallery to facilitate the teaching of art and art research at the college. The current museum was established at the Ebert Art Center in 1997. The museum houses two small galleries, the Charlene Derge Sussel Art Gallery and the Burton D. Morgan Gallery, as well as storage for the college's permanent art collection. The museum's encyclopedic collection spans from ancient to contemporary art. Permanent collections include the John Taylor Arms Print Collection - which represents works by [[Edward Hopper]], [[Winslow Homer]], [[Isabel Bishop]], [[Martin Lewis (artist)|Martin Lewis]], [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Käthe Kollwitz]] and [[Félix Bracquemond]] - the William C. Mithoefer Collection of African Art, Middle Eastern pottery and Chinese decorative art.

===Residence life===

The College of Wooster is a residential campus and has 16 residence halls, which house 16 to 270 students each, and 30 program houses that 99% of the student body live in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residences|url=http://www.wooster.edu/students/reslife/residences/|website=www.wooster.edu|publisher=The College of Wooster|accessdate=22 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104105228/http://www.wooster.edu/students/reslife/residences|archivedate=4 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The residence halls include Andrews Hall, Armington Hall, Babcock Hall, Bissman Hall, Bornhuetter Hall, Brush Hall, Compton Hall, Douglass Hall, Gault Manor, Gault Schoolhouse, Holden Hall, Kenarden Lodge, Luce Hall, Stevenson Hall, and Wagner Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Halls|url=http://www.wooster.edu/students/reslife/residences/halls/|website=www.wooster.edu|publisher=The College of Wooster|accessdate=21 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020124652/http://www.wooster.edu/students/reslife/residences/halls/|archivedate=20 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International presence===
Elias Compton, former dean of the College, founded the Wooster in India program during the 1930s, which established a sister school relationship with [[Ewing Christian College]] in [[Allahabad, India]]. Over a forty-year time span, Wooster sent several former students to serve as Head Resident at Ewing while Ewing faculty were brought to Wooster as Ewing Fellows; a plaque with the names of Ewing Fellows hangs in Babcock Hall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Education Week {{pipe}} Cosmos |date=October 2008 |volume=22 Issue 3 |url=http://www3.wooster.edu/oisa/COSMOS/2008-09/november.pdf |format=PDF |publisher=Wooster.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209072013/http://www.wooster.edu/oisa/COSMOS/2008-09/november.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wooster in India program helped build this unique bond between Wooster and India that enhanced the exchange of students, ideas and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Thewoostervoice.com |title=International Insight |url=http://thewoostervoice.com/2009/08/international-insight-3/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208232922/http://thewoostervoice.com/2009/08/international-insight-3/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-12-08 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This international presence affected the entire campus, establishing a tradition which continues to influence the College. Today, approximately six percent of the student body is international in origin, representing more than 30 different countries.&lt;ref name='wooster.edu'/&gt; The College offers majors in Cultural Area Studies and International Relations, instruction in seven foreign languages and opportunities to study abroad in 60 countries. Fifty-nine percent of Wooster students are from outside of Ohio.&lt;ref name='wooster.edu'/&gt;

The building features submarine-inspired architectural details, like a winding floorplan and porthole windows.

===Athletics===
Wooster's athletic history dates back to its first baseball team, in 1880, which played only one game, losing 12-2 to [[Kenyon College]].  The football program was established in 1889; over its first two seasons, the team won all seven games it played, by a total score of 306-4.  Included was a 64-0 victory at [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]] on November 1, 1890, in the Buckeyes' first-ever home football game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=12442 |title=Site of First Ohio State Home Football Game / The Ohio State University First Football Team 1890 Marker |publisher=Hmdb.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly thereafter, intercollegiate sports were banned by the College President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://athletics.wooster.edu/fb/archives/history.php |title=Athletics - College of Wooster |publisher=Athletics.wooster.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602063939/http://athletics.wooster.edu/fb/archives/history.php |archivedate=2008-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After varsity athletics returned in 1901, Wooster became an early member of the [[Ohio Athletic Conference]]  (OAC).  In 1983, Wooster (along with the rest of the [[Five Colleges of Ohio|Ohio Five]]) broke away from the OAC to form the [[North Coast Athletic Conference]] (NCAC).  The NCAC, which competes at the non-scholarship [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] level of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], was founded primarily on the principle of offering women equal opportunity to participate in varsity sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northcoast.org/history.html |title=NCAC History |publisher=Northcoast.org |date= |accessdate=2010-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607184750/http://www.northcoast.org/history.html |archivedate=2011-06-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its first season of competition, 1984–85, the NCAC sponsored 21 sports, eleven for men and ten for women.  Women's softball was added in 1998, and women's golf in 2010, giving the NCAC its current 23 sports.  Wooster fields varsity athletic teams in all 23 of these sports.

====Scottish heritage====
Wooster's school colors are black and old gold, and its mascot is the 'Fighting [[Scottish ethnicity|Scot]]'.  Early Wooster teams were known as the Presbyterians, or unofficially as the 'Presbyterian Steamroller', due to the football team's success.&lt;ref&gt;The Presbyterian church in America is descended from the [[Church of Scotland]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1939, a large donation from alumnus Birt Babcock funded the purchase of kilts for the marching band, in the yellow-and-black [[Clan MacLeod|MacLeod]] tartan (MacLeod of Lewis), which had no particular significance, except that it matched the school colors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://admissions.wooster.edu/traditions/kilts.php |title=Admissions &amp; Financial Aid - College of Wooster |publisher=Admissions.wooster.edu |date=2010-04-28 |accessdate=2010-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509172602/http://admissions.wooster.edu/traditions/kilts.php |archivedate=2008-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Scotland|Scottish]] culture eventually became an important part of the school's heritage; today, the [[American football|football]] games feature a Scottish [[pipe band]] with Highland dancers in addition to a traditional marching band, with all three groups clad in the MacLeod tartan.{{citation needed|date = October 2013}} The college offers the "Scottish Arts Scholarship" for students who perform as pipers, drummers, or Scottish dancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish Arts Scholarship|url=http://www.wooster.edu/admissions/scholarships/scottish/|website=www.wooster.edu|publisher=The College of Wooster|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baseball====
The baseball team has made five appearances in the [[NCAA Division III Baseball Championship|NCAA Division III World Series]], including second-place finishes in 2009 and 1997.  Wooster has made 23 appearances in the NCAA baseball tournament under head coach Tim Pettorini, who has led the Scots since 1982. Pettorini has guided the Scots to over 1,100 victories, placing him in the all-time top ten among D-III baseball coaches, and the winningest active coach as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/baseball_RB/2016/coach.pdf|title=NCAA Baseball Coaching Records|last=|first=|date=2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Scots have also won a conference-record seventeen NCAC championships, most recently in 2017, under Pettorini.  Prior to Pettorini's tenure, Bob Morgan led the Scots to the NCAA tournament in each of his final five seasons, giving Wooster a total of 25 appearances since the event began in 1976.  During the first decade of the 21st century, the Scots had a record of 372-98, winning more games than any other team in Division III, and were second in winning percentage over that span, trailing only  [[The College of St. Scholastica]].  Following his graduation in 2010, All-American second baseman Matthew Johnson signed with the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] organization, and played for four seasons in their minor-league system.

====Basketball====
Long-time head men's basketball coach Steve Moore has won over 700 games at Wooster, and in 2017 became the second-winningest coach all-time in NCAA Division III.  His teams have won 17 NCAC championships and have made 24 appearances in the [[NCAA Men's Division III Basketball Championship]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northcoast.org/mb/mballtime.pdf |title=North Coast Athletic Conference : Men's Basketball All-Time Standings |publisher=Northcoast.org |accessdate=2014-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326150528/http://www.northcoast.org/mb/mballtime.pdf |archivedate=2010-03-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including a record 14 in a row from 2003 through 2016. The team reached the national semifinals ("Final Four") of the NCAA D-III Tournament in 2003, 2007, and 2011.  The 2011 team set a school record for victories, with a record of 31-3, and reached the national championship game before falling to [[University of St. Thomas (Minnesota)|St. Thomas (Minnesota)]].  The 2003 team was close behind at 30-3, with center Bryan Nelson named D-III Men's Basketball Player of the Year.  Home games are contested in the 3,400-seat Timken Gym,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woosterathletics.com/facilities/files/timken.html |title=College of Wooster Athletics : Timken Gymnasium |publisher=Woosterathletics.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is often filled to capacity for big games, including the rivalry contest with [[Wittenberg University]] and post-season tournaments.  Since 2000, the Scots have been in the top ten in D-III basketball attendance every year, ranking 2nd in some seasons, with over 2,000 fans per home game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/m_basketball_RB/Reports/attend/2011.pdf|title=2011 NCAA MEN’S BASKETBALL ATTENDANCE|publisher=[[NCAA]]|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Football====
The University of Wooster scored the first touchdown in the state of Ohio against Denison University in 1888 and was a football powerhouse in Ohio. [[Charles Follis]], the first black professional football player, attended the University of Wooster and starred on the baseball team before signing with the Shelby Athletic Club to play professional football in 1902. Wooster was the last State of Ohio team not to be beaten by Ohio State, when it tied the Buckeyes at home on November 1, 1924. (as of 2018)
The football team's greatest success occurred between 1916 and 1934; during this era, Wooster had a record of 118-31-12,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://athletics.wooster.edu/fb/results/1900.php |title=Athletics - College of Wooster |publisher=Athletics.wooster.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008042459/http://athletics.wooster.edu/fb/results/1900.php |archivedate=2008-10-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and won four outright OAC championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oac.org/documents/2008FBGuidecb.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-29 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611072809/http://www.oac.org/documents/2008FBGuidecb.pdf |archivedate=June 11, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1934 title would be the Scots' last outright conference championship for 70 years, with only a trio of shared conference titles (1959/1970 OAC and 1997 NCAC) during that time.  In 2004, the team recorded a perfect 10-0 regular season and won its first outright NCAC conference championship, as well as its first  [[NCAA Division III National Football Championship|NCAA D-III football tournament]] game.  The 2004 team was led by senior All-American running back Tony Sutton, who set multiple NCAA Division III career rushing records and was a 2014 finalist for the Gagliardi Trophy, the D-III equivalent of the [[Heisman Trophy]].   From 1995 through 2008, Wooster's record was 99-43, making this the most successful era since [[World War II]].  In 2009, lights and artificial turf were added to the Scots' 4,500-seat John Papp stadium.  The first-ever nighttime football game at Wooster was played on October 10, 2009, against [[Case Western Reserve University]], with Case retaining the [[Baird Brothers Trophy]] by virtue of a 53-32 victory over the Scots.

====Other sports====
In the early 21st century, the women's field hockey and women's lacrosse teams each won their multiple NCAC championships, earning automatic bids to their national NCAA D-III tournaments.  The only national championship won by a Wooster athletic team came in 1975, when the men's golf team won the NCAA D-III title.

====Academic All-Americans====
Since 2000, Scots have been named Academic All-Americans 32 times by [[College Sports Information Directors of America]], in the College division, which includes NCAA Division II and Division III institutions, as well as NAIA schools, a total of over 1000 colleges.

===Performing arts===
Wooster is the home of the [[Ohio Light Opera]], an enterprise founded within the college in 1979, but not part of the college curriculum. It is the only professional company in the United States entirely devoted to [[operetta]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}. OLO performs the entire [[Gilbert &amp; Sullivan]] repertoire, but also regularly revives rarely performed continental works of the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Over the years, the Company has produced eighty different operettas.

Wooster's performing ensembles include the Wooster Symphony Orchestra, founded in 1915 by Daniel Parmelee, then Professor of Violin at the college. The orchestra currently is the second-oldest orchestra in continuous performance in the state of Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wooster.edu/Academics/Areas-of-Study/Music/Ensembles/Orchestra |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-03 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525193416/http://www.wooster.edu/Academics/Areas-of-Study/Music/Ensembles/Orchestra |archivedate=May 25, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional ensembles include the Scot Symphonic and Marching Bands, the Wooster Chorus, and the Wooster Jazz Ensemble.

Wooster has an active on-campus pipe band. Officially called the College of Wooster Pipe Band, members perform at many official on-campus events such as commencement, sports games (football, basketball, swim meets, and sometimes lacrosse games) and many spontaneous student-run events. During the spring season they perform and compete at a grade 3 level, having won prizes at the Scots wi' Shotts event in Cleveland hosted by the local Lochaber Pipe Band.  The Pipe Band also placed first in the grade 3 contest at the 2009 Toronto Indoor Highland Games, as the only American band competing.

The College's department of Theatre and Dance produces two dance concerts per year, a fall concert in the round, and a spring concert in a more formal proscenium setting.  Additionally, the college produces at least two plays each academic year.  Further plays are produced by student groups and seniors pursuing their Independent Study projects.  In 2007, Wooster's theatre production of 'Nocturne' was invited to perform at the Kennedy Center's American College Theatre Festival in Washington, D.C. Wooster's production was one of four shows chosen from a field of approximately 400 entries.

===Student activities and clubs===
The College of Wooster has over one hundred student organizations, from the Jenny Investment Club, which allows students to invest real money for the college as they learn about the stock market, to Common Grounds, a student-run coffee shop and house program offering 'an alternative atmosphere to the partying scene' for the college community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wooster.edu/commongrounds/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030910134443/http://www.wooster.edu/commongrounds/index.html |archivedate=September 10, 2003 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently ten active Greek groups at the College of Wooster, six sororities and four fraternities.  Called ''clubs'' and ''sections'', these groups are not affiliated with national Greek organizations, and approximately fifteen percent of the student body participates.

The college has a wide variety of student-run media. ''The Wooster Voice'' is the weekly student newspaper with a newly launched website, and has been published continuously since 1886 (see [[list of college newspapers]]), while [[WCWS]] (WOO 91) is the college radio station. ''The Goliard'' is the annual literary magazine. Each year, English professor Daniel Bourne also publishes an international literary magazine called ''Artful Dodge''. Additionally, the English Department has classes every two years on journalism and magazine writing; these students create and publish a newspaper and a magazine respectively.
 
The college also has a successful [[Ultimate (sport)|Ultimate Frisbee]] program. The Women's team, Betty Gone Wild, won USAUltimate's D-III College Championship Sectionals in 2014 and 2015. Also in 2014 and 2015 they came in 2nd at USAUltimate's D-III College Championship Regionals. They attended the National College Championship in 2014 and came in 15th place with a 1st place award in spirit.

The college is well known for its Moot Court team as part of the American Moot Court Association, and is currently ranked second in the nation by the ACMA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acmamootcourt.org/top-programs-in-intercollegiate-moot-court|title=Top Programs in Intercollegiate Moot Court|website=www.acmamootcourt.org|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the teams regional championships, the College routinely qualifies teams to the Moot Court Nationals tournament and was the 2008 National Champion. In 2017, Wooster qualified five teams to the nationals tournament and had teams finish 12th, 16th, and 18th in oral argument, 13th and 14th in oration, and third in appellate brief writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.acmamootcourt.org/results|title=Results|website=www.acmamootcourt.org|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team is led by professor of political theory Desiree Weber and professor emeritus and President of the ACMA Mark Weaver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wooster.edu/academics/areas/pre-law/moot-court/tournament/|title=Regional Tournament Information {{!}} The College of Wooster|website=www.wooster.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Columbia Memorial Space Center''' (CMSC) is a [[science museum]] owned and operated by the [[Downey, California|City of Downey, California]]. Located on 12400 Columbia Way in Downey, it is open to the general public as hands-on space museum and activity center in the [[Los Angeles area]].&lt;ref name="cmscdca"/&gt;

==Mission==
The center's mission is to "ignite people's passion in science, technology, engineering, and space while honoring Downey's aerospace history."&lt;ref name="cmscdca"/&gt;

==History==
The site of the museum is the former [[Boeing]]/[[Rockwell International|Rockwell]]/[[North American]] plant where all of the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]]s were built and the [[Space Shuttle]] was conceived. In 1999, when the Downey Plant closed, the City of Downey began a redevelopment effort, including an educational component. In early 2007, a builder — Tower General Contractors — was selected, and ground was broken on April 12, 2007, on the 18,000 square foot project.&lt;ref name="coll070201"/&gt;

[[File:STS-107 Flight Insignia.svg|right|thumb|STS-107 mission insignia]]
First opened in 2008, CMSC is recognized as the National Memorial to the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] and its crew that was lost on [[STS-107]].&lt;ref name="latm081128"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pl108391"/&gt;

On November 7, 2008, a propane tank exploded during the filming of an episode of the television series, ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]''. An electrical fire occurred, but resulted in no damage to the museum.&lt;ref name="nytm081107"/&gt;

==Exhibits==
Designated a [[Challenger Learning Center]],&lt;ref name="challcen"/&gt; the museum has a variety of camps, workshops, and other monthly events to generate interest in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] in addition to hands on exhibits. Now 20,000 square feet, the two-story building features a [[robotics]] lab, [[High-definition video|HD]] computer lab, and a wide range of interactive exhibits that provide engaging insights into [[Space Shuttle]] operations, living and working on the [[International Space Station]], exploration of our [[solar system]], [[aerospace engineering]], and the range of fields of study and jobs related to [[human]] and robotic [[space exploration]].&lt;ref name="cmscdca"/&gt;

In 2012, the first "Space Shuttle" – a wood and plastic full-scale mockup built by [[North American Rockwell]] in 1972 – was placed on temporary display at the center.&lt;ref name="asmg120614"/&gt; Dubbed the "[[Space Shuttle Inspiration|Space Shuttle ''Inspiration'']]", it was disassembled and returned to storage in early 2014.&lt;ref name="dpat140306"/&gt;

In front of the center, a dummy "[[boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]]" Apollo command capsule, BP-12 is on display. This was the first Apollo capsule to fly&lt;ref name="nasaksc3"/&gt; and now owned by the City of Downey, on display.&lt;ref name="amspace4"/&gt;. The center also owns the Apollo Boilerplate, BP-19A &lt;ref name="coll1200306"/&gt;, however, it is currently in storage (2018).

'''Computer graphics''' are pictures and films created using computers. Usually, the term refers to computer-generated image data created with the help of specialized graphical hardware and software. It is a vast and recently developed area of computer science. The phrase was coined in 1960, by computer graphics researchers Verne Hudson and William Fetter of Boeing. It is often abbreviated as CG, though sometimes erroneously referred to as computer-generated imagery (CGI).

Some topics in computer graphics include [[user interface design]], [[sprite (graphics)|sprite graphics]], [[vector graphics]], [[3D modeling]], [[shader]]s, [[GPU]] design, [[implicit surface]] visualization with [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]], and [[computer vision]], among others. The overall methodology depends heavily on the underlying sciences of [[geometry]], [[optics]], and [[physics]].

Computer graphics is responsible for displaying art and image data effectively and meaningfully to the consumer. It is also used for processing image data received from the physical world. Computer graphics development has had a significant impact on many types of media and has revolutionized [[animation]], [[movies]], [[advertising]], [[video game]]s, and [[graphic design]] in general.

== Overview ==
The term computer graphics has been used in a broad sense to describe "almost everything on computers that is not text or sound".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/online/tutorial/ What is Computer Graphics?], Cornell University Program of Computer Graphics. Last updated 04/15/98. Accessed November 17, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the term ''computer graphics'' refers to several different things:
* the representation and manipulation of image data by a computer
* the various [[technologies]] used to create and manipulate images
* the sub-field of [[computer science]] which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content, see [[Computer graphics (computer science)|study of computer graphics]]

Today, computer graphics is widespread. Such imagery is found in and on television, newspapers, weather reports, and in a variety of medical investigations and surgical procedures. A well-constructed [[Chart|graph]] can present complex statistics in a form that is easier to understand and interpret. In the media "such graphs are used to illustrate papers, reports, theses", and other presentation material.&lt;ref&gt;University of Leeds ISS (2002). [http://iss.leeds.ac.uk/info/306/giraphics/215/overview_of_computer_graphics/2 "What are computer graphics?"]. Last updated: 22 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Many tools have been developed to visualize data. Computer generated imagery can be categorized into several different types: two dimensional (2D), three dimensional (3D), and animated graphics. As technology has improved, [[3D computer graphics]] have become more common, but [[2D computer graphics]] are still widely used. Computer graphics has emerged as a sub-field of [[computer science]] which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content. Over the past decade, other specialized fields have been developed like [[information visualization]], and [[scientific visualization]] more concerned with "the visualization of [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensional]] phenomena (architectural, meteorological, medical, [[Biological Data Visualization|biological]], etc.), where the emphasis is on realistic renderings of volumes, surfaces, illumination sources, and so forth, perhaps with a dynamic (time) component".&lt;ref name = "MF08"&gt;[[Michael Friendly]] (2008). [http://www.math.yorku.ca/SCS/Gallery/milestone/milestone.pdf "Milestones in the history of thematic cartography, statistical graphics, and data visualization"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|History of computer animation}}

===Introduction===
The precursor sciences to the development of modern computer graphics were the advances in [[electrical engineering]], [[electronics]], and [[television]] that took place during the first half of the twentieth century. Screens could display art since the [[Lumiere brothers]]' use of [[matte (filmmaking)|mattes]] to create special effects for the earliest films dating from 1895, but such displays were limited and not interactive. The first [[cathode ray tube]], the [[Braun tube]], was invented in 1897 - it in turn would permit the [[oscilloscope]] and the military [[control panel (engineering)|control panel]] - the more direct precursors of the field, as they provided the first two-dimensional electronic displays that responded to programmatic or user input. Nevertheless, computer graphics remained relatively unknown as a discipline until the 1950s and the post-[[World War II]] period - during which time the discipline emerged from a combination of both pure [[university]] and [[laboratory]] academic research into more advanced computers and the [[United States military]]'s further development of technologies like [[radar]], advanced [[aviation]], and [[rocket]]ry developed during the war. New kinds of displays were needed to process the wealth of information resulting from such projects, leading to the development of computer graphics as a discipline.

=== 1950s ===
[[File:SAGE control room.png|thumb|right|[[SAGE Project|SAGE]] Sector Control Room.]]
Early projects like the [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]] and [[SAGE Project]]s introduced the [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] as a viable [[visual display unit|display]] and interaction interface and introduced the [[light pen]] as an [[input device]]. [[Douglas T. Ross]] of the Whirlwind SAGE system performed a personal experiment in  which a small program he wrote captured the movement of his finger and displayed its vector (his traced name) on a display scope. One of the first interactive video games to feature recognizable, interactive graphics – ''[[Tennis for Two]]'' – was created for an oscilloscope by [[William Higinbotham]] to entertain visitors in 1958 at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] and simulated a tennis match. In 1959, [[APT (programming language)|Douglas T. Ross]] innovated again while working at MIT on transforming mathematic statements into computer generated 3D machine tool vectors by taking the opportunity to create a display scope image of a [[Disney]] [[cartoon]] character.&lt;ref&gt;Ross on MIT TECH TV 1959 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob9NV8mmm20&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronics pioneer [[Hewlett-Packard]] went public in 1957 after incorporating the decade prior, and established strong ties with [[Stanford University]] through its founders, who were [[alumnus|alumni]]. This began the decades-long transformation of the southern [[San Francisco Bay Area]] into the world's leading computer technology hub - now known as [[Silicon Valley]]. The field of computer graphics developed with the emergence of computer graphics hardware.

Further advances in computing led to greater advancements in [[interactive computer graphics]]. In 1959, the [[TX-2]] computer was developed at [[Lincoln Laboratory|MIT's Lincoln Laboratory]]. The TX-2 integrated a number of new man-machine interfaces. A [[light pen]] could be used to draw sketches on the computer using [[Ivan Sutherland]]'s revolutionary [[Sketchpad|Sketchpad software]].&lt;ref name="WC03"/&gt; Using a light pen, Sketchpad allowed one to draw simple shapes on the computer screen, save them and even recall them later. The light pen itself had a small [[photoelectric cell]] in its tip. This cell emitted an electronic pulse whenever it was placed in front of a computer screen and the screen's [[electron gun]] fired directly at it. By simply timing the electronic pulse with the current location of the electron gun, it was easy to pinpoint exactly where the pen was on the screen at any given moment. Once that was determined, the computer could then draw a cursor at that location. Sutherland seemed to find the perfect solution for many of the graphics problems he faced. Even today, many standards of computer graphics interfaces got their start with this early Sketchpad program. One example of this is in drawing constraints. If one wants to draw a square for example, they do not have to worry about drawing four lines perfectly to form the edges of the box. One can simply specify that they want to draw a box, and then specify the location and size of the box. The software will then construct a perfect box, with the right dimensions and at the right location. Another example is that Sutherland's software modeled objects - not just a picture of objects. In other words, with a model of a car, one could change the size of the tires without affecting the rest of the car. It could stretch the body of car without deforming the tires.

=== 1960s ===
[[File:Spacewar!-PDP-1-20070512.jpg|thumb|''[[Spacewar (video game)|Spacewar]]'' running on the [[Computer History Museum]]'s [[PDP-1]]]]
The phrase "computer graphics" itself was coined in 1960 by [[William Fetter]], a graphic designer for [[Boeing]].&lt;ref name="WC03"&gt;Wayne Carlson (2003) [http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/lessons.html A Critical History of Computer Graphics and Animation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405172134/http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/lessons.html |date=April 5, 2007 }}. [[Ohio State University]]&lt;/ref&gt; This old quote in many secondary sources comes complete with the following sentence:
:''Fetter has said that the terms were actually given to him by Verne Hudson of the Wichita Division of Boeing''.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Peddie: The History of Visual Magic in Computers: How Beautiful Images are Made in CAD, 3D, VR and AR, Springer, 2013, p. 101, {{ISBN|978-1447149316}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1961 another student at MIT, [[Steve Russell (computer scientist)|Steve Russell]], created another important title in the history of [[video game]]s, ''[[Spacewar!]]''. Written for the [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[PDP-1]], Spacewar was an instant success and copies started flowing to other PDP-1 owners and eventually DEC got a copy.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} The engineers at DEC used it as a diagnostic program on every new PDP-1 before shipping it. The sales force picked up on this quickly enough and when installing new units, would run the "world's first video game" for their new customers. (Higginbotham's ''[[Tennis For Two]]'' had beaten ''Spacewar'' by almost three years; but it was almost unknown outside of a research or academic setting.)

E. E. Zajac, a scientist at [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratory]] (BTL), created a film called "Simulation of a two-giro gravity attitude control system" in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;David Salomon (1999). ''Computer graphics and geometric modeling''. p. ix&lt;/ref&gt; In this computer-generated film, Zajac showed how the attitude of a satellite could be altered as it orbits the Earth. He created the animation on an [[IBM 7090]] mainframe computer. Also at BTL, [[Ken Knowlton]], [[Frank Sinden]] and [[Michael Noll]] started working in the computer graphics field. Sinden created a film called [http://techchannel.att.com/play-video.cfm/2012/8/20/AT&amp;T-Archives-Force-Mass-Motion ''Force, Mass and Motion''] illustrating [[Newton's laws of motion]] in operation. Around the same time, other scientists were creating computer graphics to illustrate their research. At [[Lawrence Radiation Laboratory]], Nelson Max created the films ''Flow of a Viscous Fluid'' and ''Propagation of Shock Waves in a Solid Form''. [[Boeing Aircraft]] created a film called ''Vibration of an Aircraft''.

Also sometime in the early 1960s, [[automobile]]s would also provide a boost through the early work of [[Pierre Bézier]] at [[Renault]], who used [[Paul de Casteljau]]'s curves - now called [[Bézier curve]]s after Bézier's work in the field - to develop 3d modeling techniques for [[Renault]] car bodies. These curves would form the foundation for much curve-modeling work in the field, as curves - unlike polygons - are mathematically complex entities to draw and model well.

[[File:Pong.png|thumb|right|170px|''[[Pong]]'' arcade version]]
It was not long before major corporations started taking an interest in computer graphics. [[TRW Inc.|TRW]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed-Georgia]], [[General Electric]] and [[Sperry Rand]] are among the many companies that were getting started in computer graphics by the mid-1960s. IBM was quick to respond to this interest by releasing the [[IBM 2250]] graphics terminal, the first commercially available graphics computer. [[Ralph Baer]], a supervising engineer at [[Sanders Associates]], came up with a home [[video game]] in 1966 that was later licensed to [[Magnavox]] and called the [[Magnavox Odyssey|Odyssey]]. While very simplistic, and requiring fairly inexpensive electronic parts, it allowed the player to move points of light around on a screen. It was the first consumer computer graphics product. [[David C. Evans]] was director of engineering at [[Bendix Corporation]]'s computer division from 1953 to 1962, after which he worked for the next five years as a visiting professor at Berkeley. There he continued his interest in computers and how they interfaced with people. In 1966, the [[University of Utah]] recruited Evans to form a computer science program, and computer graphics quickly became his primary interest. This new department would become the world's primary research center for computer graphics.

Also in 1966, [[Ivan Sutherland]] continued to innovate at MIT when he invented the first computer controlled [[head-mounted display]] (HMD). Called the Sword of Damocles because of the hardware required for support, it displayed two separate wireframe images, one for each eye. This allowed the viewer to see the computer scene in [[stereoscopic 3D]]. After receiving his Ph.D. from MIT, Sutherland became Director of Information Processing at [[DARPA|ARPA]] (Advanced Research Projects Agency), and later became a professor at Harvard. In 1967 Sutherland was recruited by Evans to join the computer science program at the [[University of Utah]] - a development which would turn that department into one of the most important research centers in graphics for nearly a decade thereafter, eventually producing some of the most important pioneers in the field. There Sutherland perfected his HMD; twenty years later, NASA would re-discover his techniques in their [[virtual reality]] research. At Utah, Sutherland and Evans were highly sought after consultants by large companies, but they were frustrated at the lack of graphics hardware available at the time so they started formulating a plan to start their own company.

In 1968, [[Arthur Appel]] described the first algorithm for what would eventually become known as [[ray casting]] - a basis point for almost all of modern [[3D graphics]], as well as the later pursuit of [[photorealism]] in graphics.

In 1969, the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] initiated A Special Interest Group on Graphics ([[SIGGRAPH]]) which organizes [[List of computer science conferences#Computer graphics|conferences]], [[graphics standards]], and publications within the field of computer graphics. By 1973, the first annual SIGGRAPH conference was held, which has become one of the focuses of the organization. SIGGRAPH has grown in size and importance as the field of computer graphics has expanded over time.

=== 1970s ===
[[File:utah teapot.png|250px|thumb|right|The [[Utah teapot]] by [[Martin Newell (computer scientist)|Martin Newell]] and its static renders became emblematic of CGI development during the 1970s.]]
An astonishing amount of the breakthroughs in the field in this decade - particularly many important early breakthroughs in the transformation of graphics from utilitarian to realistic - occurred at the [[University of Utah]] in the 1970s, which had hired [[Ivan Sutherland]]. Sutherland was paired with [[David C. Evans]] to teach an advanced computer graphics class, which contributed a great deal of founding research to the field and taught several students who would grow to found several of the industry's most important companies - namely [[Pixar]], [[Silicon Graphics]], and [[Adobe Systems]].

One of these students was [[Edwin Catmull]]. Catmull had just come from The Boeing Company and had been working on his degree in physics. Growing up on [[Disney]], Catmull loved animation yet quickly discovered that he did not have the talent for drawing. Now Catmull (along with many others) saw computers as the natural progression of animation and they wanted to be part of the revolution. The first animation that Catmull saw was his own. He created an animation of his hand opening and closing. He also pioneered [[texture mapping]] to paint textures on three-dimensional models in 1974, now considered one of the fundamental techniques in [[3D modeling]]. It became one of his goals to produce a feature-length motion picture using computer graphics - a goal he would achieve two decades later after his founding role in [[Pixar]]. In the same class, [[Fred Parke]] created an animation of his wife's face.

As the UU computer graphics laboratory was attracting people from all over, [[John Warnock]] was another of those early pioneers; he would later found [[Adobe Systems]] and create a revolution in the publishing world with his [[PostScript]] page description language, and Adobe would go on later to create the industry standard [[Image editing|photo editing]] software in [[Adobe Photoshop]] and a prominent movie industry [[special effects]] program in [[Adobe After Effects]]. [[Tom Stockham]] led the image processing group at UU which worked closely with the computer graphics lab. [[James_H._Clark|James Clark]] was also there; he would later found [[Silicon Graphics]].

A major advance in 3D computer graphics was created at UU by these early pioneers - [[hidden surface determination]]. In order to draw a representation of a 3D object on the screen, the computer must determine which surfaces are "behind" the object from the viewer's perspective, and thus should be "hidden" when the computer creates (or renders) the image. The [[3D Core Graphics System]] (or '''Core''') was the first graphical standard to be developed. A group of 25 experts of the [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[Special Interest Group]] [[SIGGRAPH]] developed this "conceptual framework". The specifications were published in 1977, and it became a foundation for many future developments in the field.

Also in the 1970s, [[Henri Gouraud (computer scientist)|Henri Gouraud]], [[Jim Blinn]] and [[Bui Tuong Phong]] contributed to the foundations of [[shading]] in CGI via the development of the [[Gouraud shading]] and [[Blinn-Phong shading]] models, allowing graphics to move beyond a "flat" look to a look more accurately portraying depth. [[Jim Blinn]] also innovated further in 1978 by introducing [[bump mapping]], a technique for simulating uneven surfaces, and the predecessor to many more advanced kinds of mapping used today.

The modern [[videogame]] [[Arcade game|arcade]] as is known today was birthed in the 1970s, with the first arcade games using [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] graphics. ''[[Pong]]'' in 1972 was one of the first hit arcade cabinet games. ''[[Speed Race]]'' in 1974 featured sprites moving along a vertically [[scrolling]] road. ''[[Gun Fight]]'' in 1975 featured human-looking sprite character graphics, while ''[[Space Invaders]]'' in 1978 featured a large number of sprites on screen; both used an [[Intel 8080]] [[microprocessor]] and [[Fujitsu]] MB14241 [[Video display controller|video shifter]] to [[Graphics processing unit|accelerate]] the drawing of sprite graphics.

=== 1980s ===
[[File:Donkey Kong arcade.png|thumb|upright|''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' was one of many popular [[video game]]s that helped to popularize computer graphics to a mass audience in the 1980s.]]
The 1980s began to see the modernization and commercialization of computer graphics. As the [[home computer]] proliferated, a subject which had previously been an academics-only discipline was adopted by a much larger audience, and the number of computer graphics developers increased significantly.

In the early 1980s, the availability of [[Bit plane|bit-slice]] and [[16-bit]] microprocessors started to revolutionize high-resolution computer graphics terminals which now increasingly became intelligent, semi-standalone and standalone workstations. Graphics and application processing were increasingly migrated to the intelligence in the workstation, rather than continuing to rely on central mainframe and [[mini-computers]]. Typical of the early move to high-resolution computer graphics intelligent workstations for the computer-aided engineering market were the Orca 1000, 2000 and 3000 workstations, developed by Orcatech of Ottawa, a spin-off from [[Bell-Northern Research]], and led by [[David Pearson, Computer Scientist|David Pearson]], an early workstation pioneer. The Orca 3000 was based on Motorola 68000 and AMD bit-slice processors and had Unix as its operating system. It was targeted squarely at the sophisticated end of the design engineering sector. Artists and graphic designers began to see the personal computer, particularly the [[Commodore Amiga]] and [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]], as a serious design tool, one that could save time and draw more accurately than other methods.  The Macintosh remains a highly popular tool for computer graphics among graphic design studios and businesses. Modern computers, dating from the 1980s, often use [[graphical user interfaces]] (GUI) to present data and information with symbols, icons and pictures, rather than text. Graphics are one of the five key elements of [[multimedia]] technology.

In the field of realistic rendering, [[Japan]]'s [[Osaka University]] developed the [[Supercomputing in Japan|LINKS-1 Computer Graphics System]], a [[supercomputer]] that used up to 257 [[Zilog Z8000|Zilog Z8001]] [[microprocessor]]s, in 1982, for the purpose of rendering realistic [[3D computer graphics]]. According to the Information Processing Society of Japan: "The core of 3D image rendering is calculating the luminance of each pixel making up a rendered surface from the given viewpoint, [[Computer graphics lighting|light source]], and object position. The LINKS-1 system was developed to realize an image rendering methodology in which each pixel could be parallel processed independently using [[Ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]]. By developing a new software methodology specifically for high-speed image rendering, LINKS-1 was able to rapidly render highly realistic images. It was used to create the world's first 3D [[planetarium]]-like video of the entire [[Universe|heavens]] that was made completely with computer graphics. The video was presented at the [[Fujitsu]] pavilion at the 1985 International Exposition in [[Tsukuba, Ibaraki|Tsukuba]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museum.ipsj.or.jp/en/computer/other/0013.html|title=LINKS-1 Computer Graphics System-Computer Museum|author=Information Processing Society of Japan|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LINKS-1 was the world's most powerful [[computer]], as of 1984.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vasulka.org/archive/Writings/VideogameImpact.pdf#page=29&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the field of realistic rendering, the general [[rendering equation]] of David Immel and [[James Kajiya]] was developed in 1986 - an important step towards implementing [[global illumination]], which is necessary to pursue [[photorealism]] in computer graphics.

The continuing popularity of ''[[Star Wars]]'' and other science fiction franchises were relevant in cinematic CGI at this time, as [[Lucasfilm]] and [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] became known as the "go-to" house by many other studios for topnotch computer graphics in film. Important advances in [[chroma key]]ing ("bluescreening", etc.) were made for the later films of the original trilogy. Two other pieces of video would also outlast the era as historically relevant: [[Dire Straits]]' iconic, near-fully-CGI video for their song "[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]" in 1985, which popularized CGI among music fans of that era, and a scene from [[Young Sherlock Holmes]] the same year featuring the first fully CGI character in a feature movie (an animated stained-glass [[knight]]). In 1988, the first [[shader]]s - small programs designed specifically to do [[shading]] as a separate algorithm - were developed by [[Pixar]], which had already spun off from Industrial Light &amp; Magic as a separate entity - though the public would not see the results of such technological progress until the next decade. In the late 1980s, [[Silicon Graphics|SGI]] computers were used to create some of the first fully computer-generated [[short film]]s at [[Pixar]], and Silicon Graphics machines were considered a high-water mark for the field during the decade.

The 1980s is also called the [[Golden age (metaphor)|golden era]] of [[videogames]]; millions-selling systems from [[Atari]], [[Nintendo]] and [[Sega]], among other companies, exposed computer graphics for the first time to a new, young, and impressionable audience - as did [[MS-DOS]]-based personal computers, [[Apple II]]s and [[Macintosh computers|Macs]], and [[Amiga]]s, which also allowed users to program their own games if skilled enough. In the [[Arcade game|arcades]], advances were made in commercial, [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] 3D graphics. In 1988, the first dedicated real-time 3D [[Graphics card|graphics boards]] were introduced in arcades, with the [[Namco System 21]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=536|title=System 16 - Namco System 21 Hardware (Namco)|publisher=|accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Taito Corporation|Taito]] Air System.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.system16.com/hardware.php?id=656 |title=System 16 - Taito Air System Hardware (Taito) |publisher= |accessdate=15 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This innovation would be the precursor of the later home [[graphics processing unit]] or GPU, a technology where a separate and very powerful chip is used in [[Parallel computing|parallel processing]] with a [[CPU]] to optimize graphics.

=== 1990s ===
{{original research|section|date=July 2017}}
[[File:Quarxs-Affiche.jpg|thumb|175px|''Quarxs'', series poster, [[Maurice Benayoun]], [[François Schuiten]], 1992]]
The 1990s' overwhelming note was the emergence of [[3D modeling]] on a mass scale and an impressive rise in the quality of CGI generally. Home computers became able to take on rendering tasks that previously had been limited to workstations costing thousands of dollars; as [[list of 3D modeling software|3D modelers]] became available for home systems, the popularity of [[Silicon Graphics]] workstations declined and powerful [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Apple Macintosh]] machines running [[Autodesk]] products like [[3ds max|3D Studio]] or other home rendering software ascended in importance. By the end of the decade, the [[GPU]] would begin its rise to the prominence it still enjoys today.

The field began to see the first rendered graphics that could truly pass as [[photorealistic]] to the untrained eye (though they could not yet do so with a trained CGI artist) and [[3D graphics]] became far more popular in [[Video game|gaming]], [[multimedia]], and [[animation]]. At the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the nineties were created, in France, the very first computer graphics TV series: ''La Vie des bêtes'' by studio Mac Guff Ligne (1988), ''Les Fables Géométriques'' (1989-1991) by studio Fantôme, and ''[[Quarxs]]'', the first HDTV computer graphics series by [[Maurice Benayoun]] and [[François Schuiten]] (studio Z-A production, 1990–1993).

In film, [[Pixar]] began its serious commercial rise in this era under [[Edwin Catmull]], with its first major film release, in 1995 - [[Toy Story]] - a critical and commercial success of nine-figure magnitude. The studio to invent the programmable [[shader]] would go on to have many animated hits, and its work on prerendered video animation is still considered an industry leader and research trail breaker.

In video games, in 1992, ''[[Virtua Racing]]'', running on the [[Sega Model 1]] [[arcade system board]], laid the foundations for fully 3D [[racing game]]s and popularized real-time [[3D computer graphics|3D polygonal graphics]] among a wider audience in the [[video game industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtua Racing – Arcade (1992) |url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p13_01.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412225953/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/15influential/p13_01.html |archivedate=2010-04-12 |work=15 Most Influential Games of All Time |publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=19 January 2014 |date=14 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sega Model 2]] in 1993 and [[Sega Model 3]] in 1996 subsequently pushed the boundaries of commercial, real-time 3D graphics. Back on the PC, ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'' and ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', three of the first massively popular 3D [[first-person shooter]] games, were released by [[id Software]] to critical and popular acclaim during this decade using a rendering engine innovated{{vague|date=July 2017}} primarily by [[John Carmack]]. The [[Sony Playstation]], [[Sega Saturn]], and [[Nintendo 64]], among other consoles, sold in the millions and popularized 3D graphics for home gamers. Certain late-90's first-generation 3D titles became seen as influential in popularizing 3D graphics among console users, such as [[platform game]]s ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' and ''[[The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time]]'', and early 3D [[fighting game]]s like ''[[Virtua Fighter]]'', ''[[Battle Arena Toshinden]]'', and ''[[Tekken]]''.

Technology and algorithms for rendering continued to improve greatly. In 1996, Krishnamurty and Levoy invented [[normal mapping]] - an improvement on Jim Blinn's [[bump mapping]]. 1999 saw [[Nvidia]] release the seminal [[GeForce 256]], the first home [[video card]] billed as a [[graphics processing unit]] or GPU, which in its own words contained "integrated [[linear transformation|transform]], [[lighting]], [[triangle setup]]/[[clipping (computer graphics)|clipping]], and [[3d rendering|rendering]] engines". By the end of the decade, computers adopted common frameworks for graphics processing such as [[DirectX]] and [[OpenGL]]. Since then, computer graphics have only become more detailed and realistic, due to more powerful [[graphics hardware]] and [[3D modeling software]].   [[AMD]] also became a leading developer of graphics boards in this decade, creating a "duopoly" in the field which exists this day.

=== 2000s ===

[[File:Killing Floor Biohazard1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|A screenshot from the [[videogame]] ''[[Killing Floor (video game)|Killing Floor]]'', built in [[Unreal Engine 2]]. [[Personal computer]]s and [[console video game]]s took a great graphical leap forward in the 2000s, becoming able to display graphics in [[real time computing]] that had previously only been possible pre-rendered and/or on business-level hardware.]]

CGI became ubiquitous in earnest during this era. [[Video games]] and CGI [[film|cinema]] had spread the reach of computer graphics to the mainstream by the late 1990s and continued to do so at an accelerated pace in the 2000s. CGI was also adopted ''en masse'' for [[television advertisement]]s widely in the late 1990s and 2000s, and so became familiar to a massive audience.

The continued rise and increasing sophistication of the [[graphics processing unit]] were crucial to this decade, and 3D rendering capabilities became a standard feature as 3D-graphics GPUs became considered a necessity for [[desktop computer]] makers to offer. The [[Nvidia GeForce]] line of graphics cards dominated the market in the early decade with occasional significant competing presence from [[ATI Technologies|ATI]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danielsevo.com/hocg/hocg_2000.htm ''The Future Of Computer Graphics]''] Daniel Sevo, 2005 (retrieved 26 February 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; As the decade progressed, even low-end machines usually contained a 3D-capable GPU of some kind as [[Nvidia]] and [[AMD]] both introduced low-priced chipsets and continued to dominate the market. [[Shader]]s which had been introduced in the 1980s to perform specialized processing on the GPU would by the end of the decade become supported on most consumer hardware, speeding up graphics considerably and allowing for greatly improved [[Texture (visual arts)|texture]] and [[shading]] in computer graphics via the widespread adoption of [[normal mapping]], [[bump mapping]], and a variety of other techniques allowing the simulation of a great amount of detail.

Computer graphics used in films and [[video games]] gradually began to be realistic to the point of entering the [[uncanny valley]]. [[Computer animation|CGI]] movies proliferated, with traditional animated [[cartoon]] films like [[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]] and [[Madagascar (2005 film)|Madagascar]] as well as numerous [[Pixar]] offerings like [[Finding Nemo]] dominating the box office in this field. The ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'', released in 2001, was the first fully computer-generated feature film to use photorealistic CGI characters and be fully made with motion capture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,997597,00.html ''Cinema: A Painstaking Fantasy''] Chris Taylor, Time, 31 July 2000 (retrieved 8 August 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; The film was not a box-office success, however.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=finalfantasy.htm ''Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within''] at Box Office Mojo (retrieved 12 August 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have suggested this may be partly because the lead CGI characters had facial features which fell into the "uncanny valley".&lt;ref&gt;The uncanny valley is a hypothesis in the field of robotics and 3D computer animation, which holds that when human replicas look and act almost, but not perfectly, like actual human beings, it causes a response of revulsion among human observers. The concept "valley" refers to the dip in a graph of the comfort level of humans as a function of a robot's human likeness.&lt;/ref&gt; Other animated films like ''[[The Polar Express]]'' drew attention at this time as well. [[Star Wars]] also resurfaced with its prequel trilogy and the effects continued to set a bar for CGI in film.

In [[videogames]], the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Playstation 3|3]], the [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox]] line of consoles, and offerings from [[Nintendo]] such as the [[GameCube]] maintained a large following, as did the [[Windows PC]]. Marquee CGI-heavy titles like the series of [[Grand Theft Auto]], [[Assassin's Creed]], [[Final Fantasy]], [[BioShock]], [[Kingdom Hearts]], [[Mirror's Edge]] and dozens of others continued to approach [[photorealism]], grow the video game industry and impress, until that industry's revenues became comparable to those of movies. [[Microsoft]] made a decision to expose [[DirectX]] more easily to the independent developer world with the [[Microsoft XNA|XNA]] program, but it was not a success. DirectX itself remained a commercial success, however. [[OpenGL]] continued to mature as well, and it and [[DirectX]] improved greatly; the second-generation shader languages [[HLSL]] and [[GLSL]] began to be popular in this decade.

In [[scientific computing]], the [[GPGPU]] technique to pass large amounts of data bidirectionally between a GPU and CPU was invented; speeding up analysis on many kinds of [[bioinformatics]] and [[molecular biology]] experiments. The technique has also been used for [[Bitcoin]] mining and has applications in [[computer vision]].

=== 2010s ===
{{Expand section|date=October 2014}}

[[File:Physically Based Rendering Sample 2.png|thumb|right|A [[diamond plate]] texture rendered close-up using [[physically based rendering]] principles - increasingly an active area of research for computer graphics in the 2010s.]]

In the early half of the 2010s, CGI is nearly ubiquitous in video, pre-rendered graphics are nearly scientifically [[photorealistic]], and real-time graphics on a suitably high-end system may simulate photorealism to the untrained eye.

[[Texture mapping]] has matured into a multistage process with many layers; generally, it is not uncommon to implement texture mapping, [[bump mapping]] or [[isosurface]]s, [[normal mapping]], lighting maps including [[specular highlight]]s and [[reflection (computer graphics)|reflection]] techniques, and [[shadow volume]]s into one rendering engine using [[shader]]s, which are maturing considerably. Shaders are now very nearly a necessity for advanced work in the field, providing considerable complexity in manipulating [[pixels]], [[Vertex (computer graphics)|vertices]], and [[Texture (visual arts)|textures]] on a per-element basis, and countless possible effects. Their shader languages [[HLSL]] and [[GLSL]] are active fields of research and development. [[Physically based rendering]] or PBR, which implements even more maps to simulate real optic light flow, is an active research area as well, along with advanced [[optics]] areas like [[subsurface scattering]] and [[photon mapping]]. Experiments into the processing power required to provide graphics in [[real time (media)|real time]] at ultra-high-resolution modes like [[Ultra HD]] are beginning, though beyond reach of all but the highest-end hardware.

In cinema, most [[animation|animated movies]] are CGI now; [[List of animated feature films of the 2010s|a great many animated CGI films are made per year]], but few, if any, attempt photorealism due to continuing fears of the [[uncanny valley]]. Most are 3D [[cartoons]].

In videogames, the [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox One]], [[Sony]] [[Playstation 4]], and [[Nintendo Switch]] currently dominate the home space and are all capable of highly advanced 3D graphics; the [[Windows PC]] is still one of the most active gaming platforms as well.

== Image types ==

=== Two-dimensional ===
{{Main|2D computer graphics}}
{{See also|Video display controller}}
[[File:Blit dot.gif|thumb|[[Raster graphics|Raster graphic]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]]s (left) and masks (right)]]
[[2D computer graphics]] are the computer-based generation of [[digital image]]s&amp;mdash;mostly from models, such as digital image, and by techniques specific to them.

2D computer graphics are mainly used in applications that were originally developed upon traditional [[printing]] and [[drawing]] technologies such as typography. In those applications, the two-dimensional [[image]] is not just a representation of a real-world object, but an independent artifact with added semantic value; two-dimensional models are therefore preferred because they give more direct control of the image than [[3D computer graphics]], whose approach is more akin to [[photography]] than to [[typography]].

==== Pixel art ====
{{See also|Pixel art}}

A large form of digital art, pixel art is created through the use of [[raster graphics]] software, where images are edited on the [[pixel]] level. Graphics in most old (or relatively limited) computer and video games, [[graphing calculator]] games, and many [[mobile phone]] games are mostly pixel art.

==== Sprite graphics ====
{{See also|Sprite (computer graphics)}}

A [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] is a two-dimensional [[image]] or [[animation]] that is integrated into a larger scene. Initially including just graphical objects handled separately from the memory [[bitmap]] of a video display, this now includes various manners of graphical overlays.

Originally, sprites were a method of integrating unrelated bitmaps so that they appeared to be part of the normal bitmap on a [[Computer monitor|screen]], such as creating an animated character that can be moved on a screen without altering the [[data]] defining the overall screen. Such sprites can be created by either electronic [[Electrical circuit|circuit]]ry or [[software]]. In circuitry, a hardware sprite is a [[Computer hardware|hardware]] construct that employs custom [[Direct memory access|DMA]] channels to integrate visual elements with the main screen in that it super-imposes two discrete video sources. Software can simulate this through specialized rendering methods.

==== Vector graphics ====
{{See also|Vector graphics}}
[[File:VectorBitmapExample.svg|thumb|Example showing effect of vector graphics versus raster (bitmap) graphics.]]
[[Vector graphics]] formats are complementary to [[raster graphics]]. Raster graphics is the representation of images as an array of [[pixel]]s and is typically used for the representation of photographic images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Processing: Creative Coding and Computational Art | first = Ira| last = Greenberg | publisher = Apress | year = 2007 | isbn = 1-59059-617-X | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WTl_7H5HUZAC&amp;pg=PA115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vector graphics consists in encoding information about shapes and colors that comprise the image, which can allow for more flexibility in rendering. There are instances when working with vector tools and formats is best practice, and instances when working with raster tools and formats is best practice. There are times when both formats come together. An understanding of the advantages and limitations of each technology and the relationship between them is most likely to result in efficient and effective use of tools.

=== Three-dimensional ===
{{Main|3D computer graphics}}
{{See also|Graphics processing unit}}

3D graphics, compared to 2D graphics, are graphics that use a [[Cartesian coordinate system#Cartesian coordinates in three dimensions|three-dimensional]] representation of geometric data. For the purpose of performance, this is stored in the computer. This includes images that may be for later display or for real-time viewing.

Despite these differences, 3D computer graphics rely on similar [[algorithm]]s as 2D computer graphics do in the frame and raster graphics (like in 2D) in the final rendered display. In computer graphics software, the distinction between 2D and 3D is occasionally blurred; 2D applications may use 3D techniques to achieve effects such as lighting, and primarily 3D may use 2D rendering techniques.

3D computer graphics are the same as 3D models. The model is contained within the graphical data file, apart from the rendering. However, there are differences that include the 3D model is the representation of any 3D object. Until visually displayed a model is not graphic. Due to printing, 3D models are not only confined to virtual space. 3D rendering is how a model can be displayed. Also can be used in non-graphical [[computer simulation]]s and calculations.

=== Computer animation ===
{{See also|Computer animation}}
[[File:Activemarker2.PNG|right|thumb|Example of [[Computer animation]] produced using [[Motion capture]]]]
[[File:FractalLandscape.jpg|thumb|right|[[Fractal landscape]], an example of [[computer-generated imagery]].]]
[[Computer animation]] is the art of creating moving images via the use of [[computer]]s. It is a subfield of computer graphics and [[animation]]. Increasingly it is created by means of [[3D computer graphics]], though [[2D computer graphics]] are still widely used for stylistic, low bandwidth, and faster [[real-time rendering]] needs. Sometimes the target of the animation is the computer itself, but sometimes the target is another [[Recording medium|medium]], such as [[film]]. It is also referred to as CGI ([[Computer-generated imagery]] or computer-generated imaging), especially when used in films.

Virtual entities may contain and be controlled by assorted attributes, such as transform values (location, orientation, and scale) stored in an object's [[transformation matrix]]. Animation is the change of an attribute over time. Multiple methods of achieving animation exist; the rudimentary form is based on the creation and editing of [[keyframe]]s, each storing a value at a given time, per attribute to be animated. The 2D/3D graphics software will change with each keyframe, creating an editable curve of a value mapped over time, in which results in animation. Other methods of animation include [[procedural animation|procedural]] and [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]]-based techniques: the former consolidates related elements of animated entities into sets of attributes, useful for creating [[particle system|particle]] effects and [[crowd simulation]]s; the latter allows an evaluated result returned from a user-defined logical expression, coupled with mathematics, to automate animation in a predictable way (convenient for controlling bone behavior beyond what a [[hierarchy]] offers in [[skeletal animation|skeletal system]] set up).

To create the illusion of movement, an image is displayed on the computer [[computer display|screen]] then quickly replaced by a new image that is similar to the previous image, but shifted slightly. This technique is identical to the illusion of movement in [[television]] and [[film|motion pictures]].

== Concepts and principles ==
Images are typically created by devices such as [[camera]]s, [[mirror]]s, [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s, etc.

Digital images include both [[vector graphics|vector]] images and [[raster graphics|raster]] images, but raster images are more commonly used.

=== Pixel ===
[[File:Pixel-example.png|thumb|right|In the enlarged portion of the image individual pixels are rendered as squares and can be easily seen.]]
In digital imaging, a [[pixel]] (or picture element&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  --&gt;sig=7tg-LuGdu6Njypaawi2bbkeq8pw}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a single point in a [[raster image]]. Pixels are placed on a regular 2-dimensional grid, and are often represented using dots or squares. Each pixel is a [[sample (signal)|sample]] of an original image, where more samples typically provide a more accurate representation of the original. The [[Intensity (physics)|intensity]] of each pixel is variable; in color systems, each pixel has typically three
components such as [[RGB color model|red, green, and blue]].

[[Graphics]] are [[visual]] presentations on a surface, such as a computer screen. Examples are photographs, drawing, graphics designs, [[map]]s, [[engineering drawings]], or other images. Graphics often combine text and illustration. Graphic design may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flier, poster, web site, or book without any other element. Clarity or effective communication may be the objective, association with other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, the creation of a distinctive style.

=== Primitives ===
Primitives are basic units which a graphics system may combine to create more complex images or models. Examples would be [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]] and [[character maps]] in 2d video games, geometric primitives in CAD, or [[Triangle mesh|polygons]] or [[triangle]]s in 3d rendering. Primitives may be supported in [[Hardware acceleration|hardware for efficient rendering]], or the building blocks provided by a [[graphics application]].

=== Rendering ===
[[Rendering (computer graphics)|Rendering]] is the generation of a 2D image from a 3D model by means of computer programs. A scene file contains objects in a strictly defined language or data structure; it would contain geometry, viewpoint, [[texture mapping|texture]], [[lighting]], and [[shading]] information as a description of the virtual scene. The data contained in the scene file is then passed to a rendering program to be processed and output to a [[digital image]] or [[raster graphics]] image file. The rendering program is usually built into the computer graphics software, though others are available as plug-ins or entirely separate programs. The term "rendering" may be by analogy with an "artist's rendering" of a scene. Although the technical details of rendering methods vary, the general challenges to overcome in producing a 2D image from a 3D representation stored in a scene file are outlined as the [[graphics pipeline]] along a rendering device, such as a [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]. A GPU is a device able to assist the CPU in calculations. If a scene is to look relatively realistic and predictable under virtual lighting, the rendering software should solve the [[rendering equation]]. The rendering equation does not account for all lighting phenomena, but is a general lighting model for computer-generated imagery. 'Rendering' is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in a video editing file to produce final video output.

;3D projection
:[[3D projection]] is a method of mapping three dimensional points to a two dimensional plane. As most current methods for displaying graphical data are based on planar two dimensional media, the use of this type of projection is widespread, especially in computer graphics, engineering and drafting.

;Ray tracing
:[[Ray tracing (graphics)|Ray tracing]] is a technique for generating an [[digital image|image]] by tracing the path of [[light]] through [[pixel]]s in an [[image plane]]. The technique is capable of producing a very high degree of [[photorealism]]; usually higher than that of typical [[scanline rendering]] methods, but at a greater [[computation time|computational cost]].

;Shading
[[File:Shading1.jpg|thumb|right|Example of shading.]]
:[[Shading]] refers to [[wikt:depicting|depicting]] depth in [[3D model]]s or illustrations by varying levels of [[darkness]]. It is a process used in drawing for depicting levels of darkness on paper by applying media more densely or with a darker shade for darker areas, and less densely or with a lighter shade for lighter areas. There are various techniques of shading including [[Hatching|cross hatching]] where perpendicular lines of varying closeness are drawn in a grid pattern to shade an area. The closer the lines are together, the darker the area appears. Likewise, the farther apart the lines are, the lighter the area appears. The term has been recently generalized to mean that [[shader]]s are applied.

;Texture mapping
:[[Texture mapping]] is a method for adding detail, surface texture, or colour to a [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated graphic]] or [[3D model]]. Its application to 3D graphics was pioneered by Dr [[Edwin Catmull]] in 1974. A texture map is applied (mapped) to the surface of a shape, or polygon. This process is akin to applying patterned paper to a plain white box. Multitexturing is the use of more than one texture at a time on a polygon.&lt;ref&gt;Blythe, David. ''[http://www.opengl.org/resources/code/samples/sig99/advanced99/notes/notes.html Advanced Graphics Programming Techniques Using OpenGL].'' Siggraph 1999. (see: [http://www.opengl.org/resources/code/samples/sig99/advanced99/notes/node60.html Multitexture])&lt;/ref&gt; [[Procedural texture]]s (created from adjusting parameters of an underlying algorithm that produces an output texture), and [[bitmap|bitmap textures]] (created in an [[image editing]] application or imported from a [[digital camera]]) are, generally speaking, common methods of implementing texture definition on 3D models in computer graphics software, while intended placement of textures onto a model's surface often requires a technique known as [[UV mapping]] (arbitrary, manual layout of texture coordinates) for [[polygon mesh|polygon surfaces]], while [[non-uniform rational B-spline]] (NURB) surfaces have their own intrinsic [[parameterization]] used as texture coordinates. Texture mapping as a discipline also encompasses techniques for creating [[normal mapping|normal maps]] and [[bump map]]s that correspond to a texture to simulate height and [[specular highlight|specular map]]s to help simulate shine and light reflections, as well as [[environment mapping]] to simulate mirror-like reflectivity, also called gloss.

;Anti-aliasing
:Rendering resolution-independent entities (such as 3D models) for viewing on a raster (pixel-based) device such as a [[liquid-crystal display]] or [[Cathode ray tube|CRT television]] inevitably causes [[aliasing|aliasing artifacts]] mostly along geometric edges and the boundaries of texture details; these artifacts are informally called "[[jaggies]]". Anti-aliasing methods rectify such problems, resulting in imagery more pleasing to the viewer, but can be somewhat computationally expensive. Various anti-aliasing algorithms (such as [[supersampling]]) are able to be employed, then customized for the most efficient rendering performance versus quality of the resultant imagery; a graphics artist should consider this trade-off if anti-aliasing methods are to be used. A pre-anti-aliased [[bitmap|bitmap texture]] being displayed on a screen (or screen location) at a resolution different than the resolution of the texture itself (such as a textured model in the distance from the virtual camera) will exhibit aliasing artifacts, while any [[Procedural texture|procedurally defined texture]] will always show aliasing artifacts as they are resolution-independent; techniques such as [[mipmapping]] and [[texture filtering]] help to solve texture-related aliasing problems.

=== Volume rendering ===
[[File:CTWristImage.png|thumb|Volume rendered [[Computed tomography|CT]] scan of a forearm with different colour schemes for muscle, fat, bone, and blood.]]
[[Volume rendering]] is a technique used to display a [[3D projection|2D projection]] of a 3D discretely [[Sampling (signal processing)|sampled]] [[data set]]. A typical 3D data set is a group of 2D slice images acquired by a [[computed axial tomography|CT]] or [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] scanner.

Usually these are acquired in a regular pattern (e.g., one slice every millimeter) and usually have a regular number of image [[pixel]]s in a regular pattern. This is an example of a regular volumetric grid, with each volume element, or [[voxel]] represented by a single value that is obtained by sampling the immediate area surrounding the voxel.

=== 3D modeling ===
{{main|3D modeling}}
3D modeling is the process of developing a mathematical, [[wire frame model|wireframe]] representation of any three-dimensional object, called a "3D model", via specialized software. Models may be created automatically or manually; the manual modeling process of preparing geometric data for 3D computer graphics is similar to [[plastic arts]] such as [[sculpting]]. 3D models may be created using multiple approaches: use of NURBs to generate accurate and smooth surface patches, [[Polygonal modeling|polygonal mesh modeling]] (manipulation of faceted geometry), or polygonal mesh [[Subdivision surface|subdivision]] (advanced tessellation of polygons, resulting in smooth surfaces similar to NURB models). A 3D model can be displayed as a two-dimensional image through a process called ''[[3D rendering]]'', used in a [[computer]] [[simulation]] of physical phenomena, or animated directly for other purposes. The model can also be physically created using [[3D Printing]] devices.

== Pioneers in computer graphics ==
&lt;!-- this is just a first selection. --&gt;
;Charles Csuri
:[[Charles Csuri]] is a pioneer in computer animation and digital fine art and created the first computer art in 1964. Csuri was recognized by ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]'' as the father of digital art and computer animation, and as a pioneer of computer animation by the [[Museum of Modern Art]] (MoMA) and [[Association for Computing Machinery]]-[[SIGGRAPH]].

;Donald P. Greenberg
:[[Donald P. Greenberg]] is a leading innovator in computer graphics. Greenberg has authored hundreds of articles and served as a teacher and mentor to many prominent computer graphic artists, animators, and researchers such as [[Robert L. Cook]], [[Marc Levoy]], [[Brian A. Barsky]], and [[Wayne Lytle]]. Many of his former students have won Academy Awards for technical achievements and several have won the [[SIGGRAPH]] Achievement Award. Greenberg was the founding director of the NSF Center for Computer Graphics and Scientific Visualization.

;A. Michael Noll
:[[A. Michael Noll|Noll]] was one of the first researchers to use a [[Digital data|digital]] [[computer]] to create artistic patterns and to formalize the use of random processes in the creation of [[visual arts]]. He began creating digital art in 1962, making him one of the earliest digital artists. In 1965, Noll along with [[Frieder Nake]] and [[Georg Nees]] were the first to publicly exhibit their computer art. During April 1965, the Howard Wise Gallery exhibited Noll's computer art along with random-dot patterns by [[Bela Julesz]].

== Study of computer graphics ==
{{main|Computer graphics (computer science)}}
The [[Computer graphics (computer science)|study of computer graphics]] is a sub-field of [[computer science]] which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content. Although the term often refers to three-dimensional computer graphics, it also encompasses two-dimensional graphics and [[image processing]].

As an [[academic]] discipline, computer graphics studies the manipulation of visual and geometric information using computational techniques. It focuses on the ''mathematical'' and ''computational'' foundations of image generation and processing rather than purely [[aesthetic]] issues. Computer graphics is often differentiated from the field of [[visualization (graphic)|visualization]], although the two fields have many similarities.

== Applications ==
Computer graphics may be used in the following areas:
* [[Computational biology]]
* [[Computational photography]]
* [[Computational physics]]
* [[Computer-aided design]]
* [[Computer simulation]]
* [[Design]]

The subjects covered by Piero della Francesca in these writings include [[arithmetic]], [[algebra]], [[geometry]] and innovative work in both [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]].&lt;ref name=D&gt;[http://www.codicesillustres.com/catalogue/de_prospectiva_pingendi/], Codices Illustres&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E/&gt;

The script consists of three parts:

* Part One ''Disegno'', describing techniques for painting faces
* Part Two ''Commensurazio'', describing perspectives
* Part Three ''Coloro'', describing techniques for creating perspectives by using colours

==History==
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

''De Prospectiva Pingendi'' was probably created in the years between 1474 until 1482.&lt;ref name=B&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit13/unit13.html#Francesca], Dartmouth College&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=A&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428630/On-Perspective-in-Painting], Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=E/&gt;

The writings were inspired by the book ''[[De pictura]]'' by [[Leon Battista Alberti]]&lt;ref name=A/&gt; written in 1435&lt;ref name=B/&gt; but probably also by works by [[Euclid]].&lt;ref name=E&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emsh.calarts.edu/alumni/bkeresey/pier.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329120658/http://emsh.calarts.edu/alumni/bkeresey/pier.html |archivedate=2010-03-29 |df= }}, Computer Animation Lab&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript later came into the possession of the [[Biblioteca Palatina]] in [[Parma]]&lt;ref name=E/&gt; before it was transferred to the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]].

Much of Piero’s work was later absorbed into the writing of others, notably [[Luca Pacioli]]. Piero’s work on solid geometry appears in Pacioli’s ''[[De divina proportione]]'', a work illustrated by [[Leonardo da Vinci]].

In 1899 the writings were first published in bookform.&lt;ref name=C&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Bnh3FKIKT9AC&amp;pg=PA606&amp;lpg=PA606&amp;dq=De+prospectiva+pingendi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=44K40GH0dO&amp;sig=TW1qcfzitd7mGdpO-mIdCIl3FAw&amp;hl=sv&amp;ei=l4DBS43YHOGkOKGZ5JYE&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=De%20prospectiva%20pingendi&amp;f=false], Google Books.com&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15116">A '''direct exchange (DX) geothermal heat pump''' is a type of [[geothermal heat pump]] (or ground source heat pump) in which [[refrigerant]] circulates through [[copper]] tubing placed in the ground. It is a closed-loop, refrigerant-based geothermal system.

Direct exchange geothermal heat pumps function similarly to [[air source heat pumps]], according to the principles of [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor compression refrigeration]], except they take advantage of the relatively constant ground temperatures, which are less variable than outdoor air temperatures. Ground temperature is cooler than the outdoor air temperature in summer – making for a better heat sink – and warmer in the winter – making for a better heat source.  Direct exchange geothermal heat pumps are therefore more efficient than air source heat pumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://geoconnectionsinc.com/resources/ashp_vs_gshp.html|title=ASHP vs. GSHP {{!}} GeoConnections Inc.|website=geoconnectionsinc.com|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also quieter, more durable and require less maintenance since they don’t have any outdoor fan or outdoor coil. Furthermore, the uniformity of the underground temperature compared to the outdoor air translates into less stress on the systems.

In direct exchange systems, the refrigerant exchanges heat directly with the soil through the copper tubing. The designation “direct exchange" therefore refers to the heat transfer between the earth and the ground loop without the use of any intermediary. By contrast, [[Geothermal heat pump|water-based geothermal systems]] rely on two loops on the ground side: a primary refrigerant loop, contained in the appliance cabinet where it exchanges heat with a secondary ground loop that is buried underground and is made of high-density polyethylene containing a mixture of water and anti-freeze (propylene glycol, denatured alcohol or methanol).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.geojerry.com/earthloopantifreeze.html|title=The Types of Antifreeze Used in Geothermal Heat Pump Earth Loop Fluid|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct exchange systems eliminate the plastic water pipe and water circulating pump found in water-source geothermal systems. This simplicity allows the system to reach high efficiencies while using a shorter and smaller set of buried tubing, reducing footprint and installation cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copper.org/applications/plumbing/heatpump/geothermal/gthrml_main.html#top|title=Applications: Tube, Pipe &amp; Fittings: Direct-Exchange Geothermal Heating/Cooling Technology|website=www.copper.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all ground source heat pumps, direct exchange systems indirectly harvest solar energy, by absorbing the solar heat stored at the Earth's surface. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has called ground source heat pumps the most energy-efficient, environmentally clean and cost-effective space conditioning systems available.&lt;ref&gt;''Environmental Protection Agency (1993). "Space Conditioning: The Next Frontier - Report 430-R-93-004". EPA.''&lt;/ref&gt; Geothermal heat pumps offer significant emission reductions potential.

== History ==
[[File:First project.jpg|thumb|161x161px|DX system being drilled in the 1980s]]
The first geothermal heat pump was a DX system built in the late 1940s by Robert C. Webber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igshpa.okstate.edu/about/|title=About Us {{!}} What is IGSHPA?|website=www.igshpa.okstate.edu|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used Freon gas and buried copper tubing, for increased efficiency.

Later geothermal heat pumps designs started incorporating an additional plastic pipe loop to circulate water in deep wells in an effort to gather sufficient heat for large industrial applications, such as cement plants. Thus water-source technology advanced due to industrial interest while DX, more suited for residential and light commercial projects such as small businesses and private homes, lagged behind.

Gradually developing since the 1980s, DX technology is now experiencing a surge in popularity due in part to its simplicity, efficiency and compact footprint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://earthlinked.com/uncategorized/geothermal-industry-see-rapid-growth-earthlinked-forefront/|title=Geothermal Industry to See Rapid Growth|last=|first=|date=2016-11-28|work=|newspaper=Earthlinked Technologies|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also increasing awareness of environmental and energy issues among urban and suburban residents with limited space in which to install a system.

While the technology was expanding in the 80s and 90s, several of the early manufacturers faced issues with the refrigerant and oil management system. Oil return was especially a challenge with old system using R22 refrigerant and mineral oils, after the ban of CFC refrigerants. This is because R22 and mineral oil separate into two phases in the operating range which can cause return issues in improperly designed systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=|title=OIL IN REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS|url=http://www.rses.org/assets/serviceapplicationmanual/620-1071.pdf|journal=RSES|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays geothermal systems use polyolester oil (POE) and R-410A refrigerant. POE oil and R-410A mix very well together, which translates into superior oil return characteristics.

== Operation Principles ==
[[File:Vapor Compression Cycle.png|thumb|Vapor Compression Cycle in DX Geothermal]]
Direct exchange heat pumps are closed-loop geothermal systems which rely on small copper pipes (¼” to 1-1/8”) to exchange heat with the earth. The copper pipes are placed in the ground and form a ground loop – sometimes also referred to as earth loop or refrigerant loop - where the circulating refrigerant undergoes phase transition by exchanging heat with the ground: in heating mode it absorbs heat and changes from liquid to gas (evaporation), while in cooling mode it gives heat off and changes from gas to liquid (condensation).

A direct exchange geothermal heat pump is a type of [[Central heating and cooling|central heating and cooling system]] that functions similarly to a standard [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle|heat pump]], according to the [[Vapor-compression refrigeration|vapor-compression cycle]].

In the heating mode the ground serves as the evaporator. Liquid refrigerant coming - through the liquid line- from the heat pump’s indoor coil (serving as the condenser) is expanded and enters the smaller diameter tube of the ground loop. Heat is then transferred from the warmer ground to the ground loop. This leads to the refrigerant boiling to a vapor (evaporation) as it progresses through the loop. The refrigerant vapor then exits the ground loop and is returned -through the vapor line- to the compressor unit. Once in the compressor, the refrigerant is compressed to a higher pressure and temperature. The hot, superheated refrigerant vapor is now delivered to the indoor coil (condenser) where it gives off heat to the cooler building’s final delivery fluid with the assistance of the indoor circulator. As the refrigerant vapor gives off heat, it gradually condenses back to the liquid state.

In the cooling mode the ground serves as a condenser. Superheated vapor refrigerant from the heat pump’s compressor is pumped -through the vapor line- into the larger diameter tube of the ground loop. Heat is then transferred from the ground loop to the cooler ground. This leads to the refrigerant condensing to a full liquid as it progresses through the loop, as shown in Figure 12. The refrigerant liquid then exits the ground loop and is returned -through the liquid line- to the indoor coil to be re-expanded to a lower pressure and temperature. This will enable it to absorb heat from the space to condition with the assistance of the indoor circulator. It will also enable it to dehumidify thanks to the indoor coil (evaporator) temperature being lower than the room temperature dew point. As the refrigerant absorbs heat while passing through the indoor coil (evaporator), the refrigerant evaporates and exits as a saturated vapor towards the heat pump’s compressor.

== Applications ==
[[Image:Geoprobe Drill.jpg|thumb|right|Typical drill rig for DX installation, length 8 ft]]Direct exchange systems are rather simple refrigerant-based systems and operate without requiring anti-freezing agents, system flushing, circulating pump, water well drilling or plumbing.

Depending on the models, they can provide space heating, space cooling, domestic water heating as well as radiant floor hydronic heating and chilled water cooling.

Direct exchange geothermal systems are the least invasive geothermal systems and feature small earth loop size. Because of that, they can be installed in relatively small areas and in relatively shallow soil - typical loop depth does not exceed 100 linear feet.

Since the length of the ground loop system is minimized, DX systems require smaller drill rigs - in comparison with water well rigs - which can get into smaller spaces and yards. This provides a greater flexibility of installation and makes it an available option in more areas and for more properties.

The compactness of the earth loop systems, which require less drilling and smaller borehole, makes up for a simpler system that is cheaper and quicker to install.[[Image:SpeedStar.jpg|thumb|right|Typical drill rig for water source installation, length 22 ft]]The relative simplicity of refrigerant-based systems – relying on a one-step heat exchange process – translates not only into a simpler and less expensive installation but also into less maintenance as well: unlike [[Geothermal heat pump|water-based systems]], they do not require maintenance to top up water and glycol levels.

== Use of Copper ==
Direct exchange systems use copper because it is an [[Copper in heat exchangers|excellent ground heat exchanger material]] and easy to manufacture. Copper tubing is strong and ductile; resistant to corrosion; has a very high thermal conductivity; and is available in many different diameters and in long coil lengths. Copper connections can be brazed, the tubing may be bent, and copper tubing is economically available.

In addition, copper has a [[Copper tubing|long history of use in air conditioning and refrigeration]], and is the material of choice for potable water for water lines buried underground and in buildings.

Copper has been used since antiquity in architectural constructions because it is a noble metal – one of a few that can be found naturally in the ground. This makes it a durable, weatherproof and corrosion-resistant material with an indefinite lifetime in most soils.

Although copper is extracted from the ground itself and is a [[noble metal]] - and is therefore almost completely impervious to corrosion from soils found worldwide - it might still undergo some corrosion in abnormally aggressive soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.copper.org/resources/properties/protection/underground.html|title=Corrosion Protection &amp; Resistance: Conditions Contributing to Underground Copper Corrosion|website=www.copper.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It generally requires an oxidizing environment to start corrosion, and most soils are reducing, thus they contribute electrons to the copper and protect it against corrosion. In those areas where corrosive conditions may exist, copper will then naturally form a protective film on its surface which remains intact under most soil conditions.

In anticipation of particularly corrosive soils, DX systems come with a [[Cathodic protection|Cathodic Protection]] system. The principle is to protect the metal surface from corrosion by making it the cathode of an electrochemical cell. In that process, the metal –copper – is connected to a sacrificial metal which will corrode in its place. Corrosion of metals is an electrochemical process of deterioration that results from a loss of electrons as they react with water and/or oxygen. As the current flows from the Earth Loop Protection system, the metal surface to be protected is given in a uniform negative electrical potential that precludes corrosion of the ground loops, even in hostile environments.

== Ground loop configuration ==
[[File:ETI-FS Loop Diagrams, 01.26.11.jpg|thumb|Three main ground loop configurations]]
The ground loop system may be installed in several different configurations.  The three most common configurations are:  
# Vertical
# Diagonal
# Horizontal
Diagonal and Vertical configurations typically require drilling and grouting to be installed in drilled bore holes. Grout reseals the earth below the surface so that natural ground water aquifers are not interrupted. All diagonal and vertical systems must be grouted from the bottom up to the top.

Diagonal systems usually have a very small footprint.

Horizontal configurations usually only require trenching to be installed in excavated trenches or a pit. Horizontal systems do not usually require grout, except in the case of directional boring.

== System sizing ==

DX systems are currently manufactured in sizes from 1.5 [[Ton#Refrigeration|ton]]s (5.25&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;) to 15 tons (52&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;).  Larger projects can be accomplished through installation of multiple units.

[[File:Distribution-frame-0a-messy.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Unshielded twisted pair (copper) and optical fiber distribution frame.]]
[[File:Optical-fiber-distribution-frame-0a.jpg|thumb|right|150px|An optical fiber distribution frame.]]
In [[telecommunications]], a '''distribution frame''' is a passive device which terminates cables, allowing arbitrary interconnections to be made.

For example, the [[Main Distribution Frame]] (MDF) located at a [[telephone exchange|telephone central office]] terminates the cables leading to [[subscribers]] on the one hand, and cables leading to active equipment (such as [[DSLAM]]s and [[telephone switch]]es) on the other. Service is provided to a [[subscriber]] by manually wiring a [[twisted pair]] (called a jumper wire) between the [[telephone line]] and the relevant [[DSL]] or [[Plain old telephone service|POTS]] line circuit.

In [[broadcast engineering]], a '''distribution frame''' is a location within an apparatus room through which all [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]]s ([[Sound|audio]], [[video]], or [[data]]) pass, with the ability to arbitrarily route and connect sources and destinations between [[studio]]s and other internal and external points. Connections can either be [[solder]]ed, or made using [[terminal block]]s.  Because the frame may carry live broadcast signals, it may be considered part of the [[airchain]].

In data communication, a '''building distribution frame''' (BDF) houses data switches, etc.

==Types==
Distribution frames for specific types of signals often have specific acronyms:
* DDF - [[Digital data|digital]] distribution frame
* [[Intermediate distribution frame|IDF]] - Intermediate distribution frame
* [[Main distribution frame|MDF]] - Main distribution frame
* ODF or OFDF - [[optical fiber]] distribution frame&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160315003309/http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?patentnumber=7142765 US patent 7,142,765] -- ''High Density Optical Fiber Distribution Frame''&lt;/ref&gt;
* VDF - [[voice]] distribution frame

==Modernization==
Distribution frames may grow to extremely large sizes. In major installations, audio distribution frames can have as many as 10,000 incoming and outgoing separate copper wires ([[balanced audio]] signals require two wires plus [[earth ground]] for each signal). Telephone signals do not use a separate earth ground wire, but some urban [[Telephone exchange|exchanges]] have about 250,000 wires on their [[Main distribution frame|MDF]]. Installing and rewiring these jumpers is a labour-intensive task, leading to attempts in the industry to devise so-called active distribution frames or [[Automated Main Distribution Frame]]s. The principal issues which stand in the way of their widespread adoption are cost and reliability.

Newer [[Digital data|digital]] [[mixing console]]s can act as control points for a distribution frame or [[router (computing)|router]], which can handle audio from multiple studios (even for multiple co-located [[radio station|radio]] or [[television station|TV]] stations) at the same time.  Multiple smaller frames, such as one for each studio, can be linked together with fibre-optics (which also helps eliminate [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loops]]), or with [[gigabit Ethernet]].  This has the advantage of not having to route dozens of feeds through [[wall]]s (and sometimes [[floor]]s and [[ceiling]]s) to a single point.

'''Eastern Asia''' is one of the regions of [[temperate]] [[Asia]] defined in the [[World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions]] (WGSRPD) for use in recording the distribution of plants. It is very much smaller than common definitions of [[East Asia]]. It consists of the [[Korean Peninsula]], [[Japan]] ([[Hokkaido]], [[Honshu]], [[Kyushu]] and [[Shikoku]], plus associated offshore islands – the [[Volcano Islands]] (Kazan-retto), the [[Ryukyu Islands]] (Nansei-shoto) and the [[Bonin Islands]] (Ogasawara-shoto)), and [[Geography of Taiwan|Taiwan]].{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|page=42}} Some islands belonging to Japan politically, such as [[Marcus Island]] (Minami-Tori-shima), have greater floristic affinity with similar Pacific islands and are placed in the botanical continent of the Pacific.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|page=5}}

==WGSRPD system==
The WGSRPD is a [[biogeography|biogeographical]] system developed by the international [[Biodiversity Information Standards|Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG)]] organization.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|page=ix}} The system provides clear definitions and codes for recording [[plant]] distributions at four scales or levels, from "botanical continents" down to parts of large countries.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|pages=xi,19}} The top two levels are given numerical codes. The botanical continent 3 Asia-Temperate has nine regions, one of which is 38 Eastern Asia.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=19}}

Organizations and works using the scheme include the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN),&lt;ref name=use&gt;{{cite web |title=Who Is Using This Standard |website=Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) |url=http://www.tdwg.org/standards/109/usageInfo/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713195024/http://www.tdwg.org/standards/109/usageInfo/ |accessdate=2015-08-02 |archivedate=2015-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Germplasm Resources Information Network]] (GRIN), and the [[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]] (WCSP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/about.do | title=About the Checklist |work=World Checklist of Selected Plant Families |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew |accessdate=2008-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the entry for ''[[Lilium concolor]]'' in the WCSP includes the numerical codes "30 31 36 37 38",&lt;ref name="WCSP_279952"&gt;{{citation |title=''Lilium concolor''|work=[[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]] |publisher=[[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] |url=http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/namedetail.do?name_id=279952 |accessdate=2015-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; the initial "3" showing these are all regions of Asia-Temperate, with "38" being Eastern Asia.

==Eastern Asia subdivisions==
The Eastern Asia region is subdivided into areas and "basic recording units", which are given letter codes:{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|page=42}}

==Changes==

Some small changes were made to the Eastern Asia region between the first and second editions of the WGSRPD. The [[Volcano Islands]] (Kazan-retto) and the [[Bonin Islands]] (Ogasawara-shoto) were moved from the Pacific botanical continent to Eastern Asia within Asia-Temperate as they have many [[Endemism|endemic]] plants in common with Eastern Asia.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|page=5}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10880">'''Empathic concern''' refers to other-oriented emotions elicited by and congruent with the perceived welfare of someone in need.&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D. (1991). The altruism question: Toward a social-psychological answer. Hillsdale: Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D. (1987). Prosocial motivation: Is it ever truly altruistic? In L. Berkowitz (Ed.), Advances in Experimental Social Psychology (Vol. 20, pp. 65-122). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These other-oriented [[emotions]] include feelings of tenderness, [[sympathy]], [[compassion]], soft-heartedness, and the like. 

Empathic concern is often and wrongly confused with [[empathy]]. To empathize is to respond to another's perceived emotional state by experiencing feeling of a similar sort. Empathic concern or sympathy not only include empathizing, but also entails having a positive regard or a non-fleeting concern for the other person.&lt;ref&gt;Chismar, D. (1988). Empathy and sympathy: the important difference. The Journal of Value Inquiry, 22, 257-266.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
[[Daniel Batson|C. Daniel Batson]] is one pioneer of the term. His mature definition of the term is "other-oriented emotion elicited by and congruent with the perceived welfare of someone in need".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Batson, C.D. (2011). ''Altruism in Humans'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Batson explains this definition in the following way:

{{Quote|First, "congruent" here refers not to the specific content of the emotion but to the valence&amp;mdash;positive when the perceived welfare of the other is positive, negative when the perceived welfare is negative.&amp;nbsp;... Third, as defined, empathic concern is not a single, discrete emotion but includes a whole constellation. It includes feelings of sympathy, compassion, softheartedness, tenderness, sorrow, sadness, upset, distress, concern, and grief. Fourth, empathic concern is other-oriented in the sense that it involves feeling ''for'' the other&amp;mdash;feeling sympathy for, compassion for, sorry for, distressed for, concerned for, and so on.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;}}

Many writers other than Batson use different terms for this construct or very similar constructs. Especially popular&amp;mdash;perhaps more popular than "empathic concern"&amp;mdash;are ''sympathy'', ''compassion'' or ''pity''.&lt;ref&gt;These are used by numerous philosophers and social scientists including [[Charles Darwin]], [[Frans de Waal]], [[Nancy Eisenberg]], and [[Stephen Darwall]], as documented in Batson's ''Altruism in Humans'', p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Other terms include ''the tender emotion'' and ''sympathetic distress''.&lt;ref&gt;These latter two terms are due, respectively, to [[William McDougall (psychologist)|William McDougall]] and [[Martin Hoffman]]. See Batson, C.D. (2011). ''Altruism in Humans'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human beings are strongly motivated to be connected to others.&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D. (1990). How social an animal? The human capacity for caring. American Psychologist 45: 336-346.&lt;/ref&gt; In humans and higher mammals, an impulse to care for offspring is almost certainly genetically hard-wired, although modifiable by circumstance.

==Evolutionary origins==
At the behavioral level it is evident from the descriptions of comparative psychologists and ethologists that behaviors homologous to empathic concern can be observed in other [[mammalian]] species. Notably, a variety of reports on ape empathic reactions suggest that, apart from emotional connectedness, [[apes]] have an explicit appreciation of the other's situation.&lt;ref&gt;De Waal, F.B.M. (1996). Good Natured: The origins of right and wrong in humans and other animals. Harvard: Harvard University Press. Harvard: Harvard University&lt;/ref&gt; A good example is consolation, defined as reassurance behavior by an uninvolved bystander towards one of the combatants in a previous aggressive incident.&lt;ref&gt;De Waal, F.B.M., &amp; van Roosmalen, A. (1979). Reconciliation and consolation among chimpanzees. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 5, 55-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developmental origins==
Empathic concern is thought to emerge later developmental and to require more self-control than either [[emotional contagion]] or [[personal distress]].&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N., &amp; Strayer, J. (1997). Empathy and its Development. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Developmental research indicates a broad range of social competencies children bring to their interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., &amp; Meyer, M. (2008). From emotion resonance to empathic understanding: A social developmental neuroscience account. Development and Psychopathology, 20, 1053-1080.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 2 years of age, they show (a) the cognitive capacity to interpret, in simple ways, the physical and psychological states of others, (b) the emotional capacity to experience, affectively, the state of others, and (c) the behavioral repertoire that permits the possibility of attempts to alleviate discomfort in others.&lt;ref&gt;Zahn-Waxler, C, Radke-Yarrow, M., Wagner, E., &amp; Chapman, M. (1992). Development of concern for others. Developmental Psychology, 28, 126-136.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both personal disposition such as [[temperament]] and social context contribute to individual differences in concern for others. Some developmental psychologists have hypothesized that empathic concern for others are essential factors inhibiting [[aggression]] toward others.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N., &amp; Eggum, N.D. (2009). Empathic responding: sympathy and personal distress. In: J. Decety and W. Ickes, The Social Neuroscience of Empathy. Cambridge: MIT Press, pp 71-83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Hoffman|Hoffman, M.L.]] (2000). Empathy and Moral Development. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution of social psychology==
Empathic concern may produce an [[altruistic]] motivation to reduce the other person's distress.&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D., &amp; Shaw, L.L. (1991). Evidence for altruism: Toward a pluralism of prosocial motives. Psychological Inquiry, 2, 107-122).&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge of demonstrating the existence of altruistic motivation is to show how empathic concern leads to helping in ways that cannot be explained by prevailing theories of egoistic motivation. That is, a clear case needs to be made that it is concern about the other person's welfare, not a desire to improve one's own welfare, that primarily drives one's helping behavior in a particular situation. 

Empirical studies conducted by social psychologist [[Daniel Batson]] have demonstrated that empathic concern is felt when one adopts the perspective of another person in need. His work emphasizes the different emotions evoked when imagining another situation from a self-perspective or imagining from another perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Batson, C.D. (2009). Two forms of perspective taking: imagining how another feels and imagining how you would feel. In K.D. Markman, W.M.P. Klein and J.A. Suhr (Eds.), Handbook of Imagination and Mental Simulation (pp. 267-279). New York: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The former is often associated with [[personal distress]] (i.e., feelings of discomfort and anxiety), whereas the latter leads to empathic concern.

==Social neuroscience evidence==

[[Social neuroscience]] explores the biological underpinnings of empathic concern and more generally interpersonal sensitivity, using an integrative approach that bridges the biological and social levels.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., &amp; Keenan, J.P. (2006). Social neuroscience: A new journal. Social Neuroscience, 1, 1-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Neural systems, including autonomic functions, that rely on brain stem [[neuropeptides]], such as [[oxytocin]] and [[vasopressin]], are plausible correlates for empathic concern. Alternatively, vasopressin might be implicated in situations where a more active strategy is required for an effective response.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, C.S., Harris, J., &amp; Porges, S.W. (2009). Neural and evolutionary perspectives on empathy In: J. Decety and W. Ickes, The Social Neuroscience of Empathy. Cambridge: MIT press, pp 169-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

An association between [[executive functions]], underpinned by the [[prefrontal cortex]] with reciprocal connections with the [[limbic system]], the [[sense of agency]], and empathic concern has been suggested based on lesion studies in neurological patients and [[functional neuroimaging]] experiments in healthy individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., &amp; Jackson, P.L. (2004). The functional architecture of human empathy. Behavioral and Cognitive Neuroscience Reviews, 3, 71-100.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The difference between imaging self versus imaging other is supported by a series of [[functional neuroimaging]] studies of affective processing. For instance, Lamm, Batson and Decety (2007) found that participants reported more empathic concern when imagining the [[pain]] of others when adopting another perspective, and more personal [[suffering|distress]] when imagining themselves to be in pain.&lt;ref&gt;Lamm, C., Batson, C.D., &amp; Decety, J. (2007). The neural substrate of human empathy: effects of perspective-taking and cognitive appraisal. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 19, 42-58.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The fMRI scans revealed that imagining self in pain was associated with strong activation in brain areas involved in affective response to threat and pain, including the amygdala, insula and anterior cingulate cortex. Imagine-other instructions produced higher activity in the right temporoparietal junction (or TPJ), which is associated with self-other distinctiveness and the sense of agency.

'''Ethnobotany''' is the study of a region's plants and their practical uses through the traditional knowledge of a local culture and people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/ethnobotany/|title=Ethnobotany|website=www.fs.fed.us|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ethnobotanist thus strives to document the local customs involving the practical uses of local flora  for many aspects of life, such as plants as medicines, foods, and clothing.&lt;ref name=eplantscience&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eplantscience.com/index/ethnobotany.php|title=Ethnobotany|website=www.eplantscience.com|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Evans Schultes]], often referred to as the "father of ethnobotany",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/13/us/richard-e-schultes-86-dies-trailblazing-authority-on-hallucinogenic-plants.html|title=Richard E.

==History==
[[Image:Ojibweherbalistmedicine.png|thumb|Plants have been widely used by [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] healers, such as this [[Ojibwa]] man.]]
The idea of ethnobotany was first proposed by the early 20th century botanist [[John William Harshberger]].&lt;ref name=auto&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=James T.|title=The National cyclopædia of American biography ... v.21.|date=1931|publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Harshberger did perform ethnobotanical research extensively, including in areas such as North Africa, Mexico, Scandinavia, and Pennsylvania,&lt;ref name=auto/&gt; it was not until [[Richard Evans Schultes]] began his trips into the Amazon that ethnobotany become a more well known science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ponman, Bussmann|first1=Bruce E, Rainer W.|title=Medicinal Plants and the Legacy of Richard E. Schultes|year=2012|publisher=Missouri Botanical Garden|isbn=0984841520|url=http://www.nybg.org/files/scientists/mbalick/Balick_preprint.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the practice of ethnobotany is thought to have much earlier origins in the first century AD when a Greek physician by the name of [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] wrote an extensive botanical text detailing the medical and culinary properties of "over 600 mediterranean plants" named [[De Materia Medica]].&lt;ref name=eplantscience/&gt; Historians note that Dioscorides wrote about traveling often throughout the Roman empire, including regions such as "Greece, Crete, Egypt, and Petra",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mazal, Otto|title=Dioscorides: De Materia Medica|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/aconite/materiamedica.html|website=Uchicago.edu|publisher=[[University of Chicago]]|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in doing so obtained substantial knowledge about the local plants and their useful properties. European botanical knowledge drastically expanded once the New World was discovered due to ethnobotany. This expansion in knowledge can be primarily attributed to the substantial influx of new plants from the Americas, including crops such as potatoes, peanuts, avocados, and tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/nattrans/ntecoindian/essays/columbianb.htm|title=The Columbian Exchange, Native Americans and the Land, Nature Transformed, TeacherServe, National Humanities Center|website=nationalhumanitiescenter.org|publisher=[[National Humanities Center]]|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One French explorer in the 16th century, [[Jacques Cartier]],  learned a cure for scurvy (a tea made from boiling the bark of the Sitka Spruce) from a local [[Iroquois]] tribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/library/documents/treebook/sitkaspruce.htm|title=Sitka spruce|website=www.for.gov.bc.ca|place=[[British Columbia]]|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval and Renaissance==
During the medieval period, ethnobotanical studies were commonly found connected with [[Christian monasticism#Contributions|monasticism]]. Notable at this time was [[Hildegard of Bingen|Hildegard von Bingen]]. However, most botanical knowledge was kept in gardens such as [[physic garden]]s attached to hospitals and religious buildings. It was thought of in practical use terms for culinary and medical purposes and the ethnographic element was not studied as a modern [[anthropologist]] might approach ethnobotany today.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

==Age of Reason==
Carl Linnaeus carried out in 1732 a [[Expedition to Lapland|research expedition]] in Scandinavia asking the [[Sami people]] about their [[Ethnology|ethnological]] usage of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Before Boas: The Genesis of Ethnography and Ethnology in the German Enlightenment Critical Studies in the History of Anthropology Series|author=Han F. Vermeulen|publisher=[[University of Nebraska Press]]|year=2015|isbn=9780803277380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[age of enlightenment]] saw a rise in economic [[botanical]] exploration. [[Alexander von Humboldt]] collected data from the New World, and [[James Cook]]'s voyages brought back collections and information on plants from the South Pacific. At this time major botanical gardens were started, for instance the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] in 1759. The directors of the gardens sent out [[List of gardener-botanist explorers of the Enlightenment|gardener-botanist explorers]] to care for and collect plants to add to their collections.

As the 18th century became the 19th, ethnobotany saw expeditions undertaken with more colonial aims rather than trade economics such as that of [[Lewis and Clark Expedition|Lewis and Clarke]] which recorded both plants and the peoples encountered use of them. [[Edward Palmer (botanist)|Edward Palmer]] collected [[material culture]] artifacts and botanical specimens from people in the North American West ([[Great Basin]]) and Mexico from the 1860s to the 1890s. Through all of this research, the field of "aboriginal botany" was established—the study of all forms of the vegetable world which [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal peoples]] use for food, medicine, [[textile]]s, ornaments and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Economic Botany: Principles and Practices|author=G.E. Wickens|edition=illustrated|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=2012|isbn=9789401009690|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and application in modern science==
The first individual to study the [[emic]] perspective of the plant world was a German physician working in Sarajevo at the end of the 19th century: Leopold Glück. His published work on traditional medical uses of plants done by rural people in Bosnia (1896) has to be considered the first modern ethnobotanical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethnobotany and Biocultural Diversities in the Balkans: Perspectives on Sustainable Rural Development and Reconciliation|editor=Andrea Pieroni, Cassandra L. Quave|edition=illustrated|publisher=Springer|year=2014|isbn=9781493914920|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Other scholars analyzed uses of plants under an indigenous/local perspective in the 20th century: [[Matilda Coxe Stevenson]], Zuni plants (1915); [[Frank Hamilton Cushing|Frank Cushing]], Zuni foods (1920); [[Keewaydinoquay Peschel]], Anishinaabe fungi (1998), and the team approach of Wilfred Robbins, [[John Peabody Harrington]], and [[Barbara Freire-Marreco]], Tewa pueblo plants (1916).

In the beginning, ethonobotanical specimens and studies were not very reliable and sometimes not helpful. This is because the botanists and the anthropologists did not always collaborate in their work. The botanists focused on identifying species and how the plants were used instead of concentrating upon how plants fit into people's lives. On the other hand, anthropologists were interested in the cultural role of plants and treated other scientific aspects superficially. In the early 20th century, botanists and anthropologists better collaborated and the collection of reliable, detailed cross-disciplinary data began.

Beginning in the 20th century, the field of ethnobotany experienced a shift from the raw compilation of data to a greater methodological and conceptual reorientation. This is also the beginning of academic ethnobotany. The so-called "father" of this discipline is [[Richard Evans Schultes]], even though he did not actually coin the term "ethnobotany". Today the field of ethnobotany requires a variety of skills: botanical training for the identification and preservation of plant specimens; anthropological training to understand the cultural concepts around the perception of plants; linguistic training, at least enough to transcribe local terms and understand native morphology, syntax, and semantics.

[[Mark Plotkin]], who studied at [[Harvard University]], the [[Yale School of Forestry]] and [[Tufts University]], has contributed a number of books on ethnobotany. He completed a handbook for the [[Tirio people]] of [[Suriname]] detailing their medicinal plants; ''Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice'' (1994); ''The Shaman's Apprentice,'' a children's book with Lynne Cherry (1998); and  ''Medicine Quest: In Search of Nature's Healing Secrets'' (2000).

Plotkin was interviewed in 1998 by ''[[South American Explorers|South American Explorer]]'' magazine, just after the release of ''Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice'' and the [[IMAX]] movie Amazonia. In the book, he stated that he saw wisdom in both traditional and Western forms of medicine:
&lt;blockquote&gt;No medical system has all the answers—no shaman that I've worked with has the equivalent of a polio vaccine and no dermatologist that I've been to could cure a fungal infection as effectively (and inexpensively) as some of my Amazonian mentors. It shouldn't be the doctor versus the witch doctor. It should be the best aspects of all medical systems ([[Ayurveda|ayurvedic]], [[herbalism]], [[Homeopathy|homeopathic]], and so on) combined in a way which makes health care more effective and more affordable for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Shaman's Apprentice|accessdate=May 2, 2018}} ''South American Explorer'', Autumn 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A great deal of information about the traditional uses of plants is still intact with tribal peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Sood, S.K., Nath, R. and Kalia, D.C. 2001. ''Ethnobotany of Cold Desert Tribes of Lahoul-Spiti'' (''N.W. Himalaya''). Deep Publications, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; But the native healers are often reluctant to accurately share their knowledge to outsiders. Schultes actually apprenticed himself to an Amazonian shaman, which involves a long-term commitment and genuine relationship. In ''Wind in the Blood: Mayan Healing &amp; Chinese Medicine'' by Garcia et al. the visiting acupuncturists were able to access levels of Mayan medicine that anthropologists could not because they had something to share in exchange. Cherokee medicine priest [[David Winston]] describes how his uncle would invent nonsense to satisfy visiting anthropologists.&lt;ref&gt;''Wind in the Blood: Mayan Healing and Chinese Medicine'', by Hernan Garcia, Antonio Sierra, Hilberto Balam, and Jeff Connant&lt;/ref&gt;

Another scholar, James W. Herrick, who studied under ethnologist [[William N. Fenton]], in his work ''Iroquois Medical Ethnobotany'' (1995) with Dean R. Snow (editor), professor of Anthropology at Penn State, explains that understanding herbal medicines in traditional Iroquois cultures is rooted in a strong and ancient [[cosmological]] belief system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=American Indian Culture and Research Journal|volume=20|issue=2|publisher=American Indian Culture and Research Center, University of California|year=1996|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their work provides perceptions and conceptions of illness and imbalances which can manifest in physical forms from benign maladies to serious diseases. It also includes a large compilation of Herrick’s field work from numerous Iroquois authorities of over 450 names, uses, and preparations of plants for various ailments. Traditional Iroquois practitioners had (and have) a sophisticated perspective on the plant world that contrast strikingly with that of modern medical science.&lt;ref&gt;Herrick, J. W. (1995). ''Iroquois Medical Botany''. Syracuse, NY: [[Syracuse University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher Cassandra Quave at Emory University has used ethnobotany to address the problems that arise from antibiotic resistance. Quave notes that the advantage of medical ethnobotany over Western medicine rests in the difference in mechanism. For example, elmleaf blackberry extract focuses instead on the prevention of bacterial collaboration as opposed to directly exterminating them. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/magazine/could-ancient-remedies-hold-the-answer-to-the-looming-antibiotics-crisis.html|title=Could Ancient Remedies Hold the Answer to the Looming Antibiotics Crisis?|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues==
{{clarify section|reason=it should explain what kind of gender biases exist, and how they came to be|date=September 2017}}
Many instances of [[gender bias]] have occurred in ethnobotany, creating the risk of drawing erroneous conclusions. Anthropologists would often consult with primarily men. In Las Pavas, a small farming community in Panama, anthropologists drew conclusions about the entire community's use of plant from their conversations and lessons with mostly men. They consulted with 40 families, but the women only participated rarely in interviews and never joined them in the field. Due to the division of labor, the knowledge of wild plants for food, medicine, and fibers, among others, was left out of the picture, resulting in a distorted view of which plants were actually important to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/163864/Gender_Bias_in_Ethnobotany_Propositions_and_Evidence_of_a_Distorted_Science_and_Promises_of_a_Brighter_Future|title=Gender Bias in Ethnobotany: Propositions and Evidence of a Distorted Science and Promises of a Brighter Future.|author=Howard, Patricia|website=academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7K0s__h3ipY|title=Gender bias in ethnobotany -- a legacy and process|publisher=TeachEthnobotany|date=2 July 2013|via=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ethnobotanists have also assumed that ownership of a resource means familiarity with that resource. In some societies women are excluded from owning land, while being the ones who work it. Inaccurate data can come from interviewing only the owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Jeanine M. Pfeiffer|author2=Ramona J.

==Structure and data collected==

=== Questions ===

A FFQ includes questions on a set of food and beverage items. For each food or beverage item, there may be questions asking about the following:&lt;ref name=nci/&gt;&lt;ref name=nhanes-en&gt;{{cite web|url = http://appliedresearch.cancer.gov/archive/usualintakes/FFQ.English.June0304.pdf|title = NHANES Food Questionnaire|accessdate = October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Frequency of consumption (with a "never" option as well as options ranging from very infrequent to several times a day).&lt;ref name=nhanes-en/&gt;
* Portion size information, which may be framed in terms of portion size for each round of consumption or total portion size. Respondents may be asked to translate usual consumption amount to number of specified units, such as a cup of rice. Some questionnaires include portion size images (such as photographs) in an attempt to enhance reporting [[accuracy]].&lt;ref name=nci/&gt;&lt;ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review/&gt;
* Other information, such as frequency of consumption at particular times of the year, or the subtype or brand that people consume.

In addition to foods and beverages, FFQs often ask about the frequency of intake and dosages of commonly consumed [[dietary supplements]].

=== Length and administration format ===

A FFQ that aims to capture total dietary intake includes questions on 80 to 120 food and beverage items, and takes 30 to 60 minutes to complete.&lt;ref name=nci/&gt;

FFQs may be interviewer-administered in case of low literacy&lt;ref name=nci/&gt; as well as when being conducted on children.&lt;ref name=lebanon-kid-ffq/&gt;

FFQs are intended for individual rather than household use (i.e., they need to be answered for each individual food consumer). For very young children, the FFQ may be answered by a parent or guardian instead.

=== Types of FFQs ===

FFQs are classified as:&lt;ref name=D/&gt;&lt;ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/multimedia/pdfs/scotdietassessmethods.pdf|title = A short review of dietary assessment methods used in National and Scottish Research Studies|last = Wrieden|first = Wendy|last2 = Peace|first2 = Heather|last3 = Armstrong|first3 = Julie|last4 = Barton|first4 = Karen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Non-quantitative FFQs if they collect only frequency information, and no portion size information, and
* Semi-quantitative FFQs if they collect information on both frequency and portion size.

== Relation with other assessment tools ==

=== Similar diet assessment tools ===

FFQ is a common method for dietary assessment, i.e., for constructing the respondent's diet history. Some other methods include:&lt;ref name=lebanon-kid-ffq/&gt;

* [[24-hour diet recall]]: This is a structured interview intended to capture detailed information about all the foods and beverages consumed by the respondent in the last 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://dietassessmentprimer.cancer.gov/profiles/recall/|title = 24-hour Dietary Recall (24HR) At a Glance|publisher = [[National Cancer Institute]]|accessdate = October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://medanth.wikispaces.com/24-hour+diet+recall|title = 24-hour diet recall|publisher = Medanth|accessdate = October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For young children, the parent or guardian may respond on the child's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Development and Pilot Testing of 24-Hour Multiple-Pass Recall to Assess Dietary Intake of Toddlers of Somali- and Iraqi-Born Mothers Living in Norway|journal = Nutrients|doi = 10.3390/nu6062333|pmc=4073154|pmid=24949548|volume=6|year=2014|pages=2333–47 | last1 = Grewal | first1 = NK | last2 = Mosdøl | first2 = A | last3 = Aunan | first3 = MB | last4 = Monsen | first4 = C | last5 = Torheim | first5 = LE}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of this method is the multiple-pass recall. Here, after an initial recall, the interviewer goes back to previous questions to clarify further details.&lt;ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review/&gt;
* Other kinds of diet history interviews, such as narrative diet histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.andjrnl.org/article/S0002-8223(00)00237-6/abstract|title = Applying Conversation Analysis to Foster Accurate Reporting in the Diet History Interview|last = Tapsell|first = Linda Clare|last2 = Brenninger|first2 = Vanessa|last3 = Barnard|first3 = Janelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Weighted food diary (also called weighted food record): The individual records details of food and beverage in the diary at the time of consumption.&lt;ref name=weighted-food-diary&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dapa-toolkit.mrc.ac.uk/dietary-assessment/methods/weighed-food-diary/indication.php|title = Dietary assessment - Weighed food diary|publisher = Medical Research Council|accessdate = October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant of this method is estimated food records, where the quantification of food and drink is estimated rather than weighed.&lt;ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review/&gt;

=== Advantages and disadvantages relative to weighted food records ===

FFQs, as well as other retrospective diet assessment methods (such as the 24-hour diet recall and other diet history methods) have the advantage that they do not directly affect the behavior of the respondent. In contrast, weighted food records may influence the participant's eating behavior. Weighted food records also carry a high respondent burden.&lt;ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review/&gt;

One disadvantage of FFQs and other retrospective methods is that they may be less accurate because participants are relying on memory rather than information recorded in real time.

=== Advantages and disadvantages relative to the 24-hour diet recall ===

FFQs have the following advantages:

* They can better capture consumption of foods consumed occasionally or episodically than the 24-hour diet recall. For instance, if people habitually consume alcohol more on Fridays, then a 24-hour diet recall conducted on Tuesday will underestimate the extent of alcohol consumption, whereas a well-designed FFQ can capture the information.&lt;ref name=nci/&gt;&lt;ref name=D/&gt;
* They are easier to administer to literate populations at large scale and also easier to process than diet recalls.&lt;ref name=D/&gt;

FFQs have many disadvantages:

* Due to the longer time period involved, FFQs are more dependent on people having good memory as well as being able to accurately estimate the frequency of rare events (for instance, being able to correctly judge whether they consume something once a month or once a week). These are cognitively complex tasks that require good generic memory.&lt;ref name=nci/&gt; 
* FFQs lack detailed information on how the food was prepared as well as information on exactly how much was consumed and when. 
* Since FFQs are limited to a fixed list of foods, they may not capture eating patterns of people who have very different eating patterns.&lt;ref name=nci/&gt;&lt;ref name=D/&gt; 
* FFQs are more subject (than diet recalls) to [[social desirability bias]], with people over-reporting the extent of consumption of "healthy" foods such as fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review/&gt;

=== Validation of FFQs using other methods ===

Due to some of the concerns surrounding the validity and reliability of FFQs, research using a FFQ generally also tests the validity of the FFQ. In a typical research design, the FFQ is validated against another dietary assessment technique (such as 24-hour diet recall or weighted food records) on a small population.&lt;ref name=nci/&gt;&lt;ref name=mediterranean-pregnant-ffq/&gt;&lt;ref name=pregnancy-pufa-ffq/&gt;&lt;ref name=lebanon-kid-ffq/&gt;&lt;ref name=north-sweden-ffq&gt;{{cite journal|pmid = 12003662|title = Validation and calibration of food-frequency questionnaire measurements in the Northern Sweden Health and Disease cohort|journal = [[Public Health Nutrition]] | doi=10.1079/PHNPHN2001315|volume=5|year=2002|pages=487–96 | last1 = Johansson | first1 = I | last2 = Hallmans | first2 = G | last3 = Wikman | first3 = A | last4 = Biessy | first4 = C | last5 = Riboli | first5 = E | last6 = Kaaks | first6 = R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once validated, the FFQ can be distributed to a wider population with the same characteristics. The need to validate FFQs against diet recalls or other more reliable methods is a recurrent theme in research and guidance on FFQs.&lt;ref name=nci-principles/&gt;

==Food frequency questionnaires in use==

=== Specificity to populations ===

Since FFQs list specific food and beverage items, a FFQ designed for and validated against one population is not valid for other populations. Therefore, FFQs must be appropriately modified and revalidated against new populations.&lt;ref name=sri-lanka-ffq&gt;{{cite journal|title = Validity of a food frequency questionnaire to assess nutritional intake among Sri Lankan adults|last = Jayawardena|first = Ranil|last2 = Byrne|first2 = Nuala|last3 = Soares|first3 = Mario|last4 = Katulanda|first4 = Prasad|last5 = Hills|first5 = Andrew|pmc=4766149|pmid=27026859|doi=10.1186/s40064-016-1837-x|volume=5|year=2016|journal=SpringerPlus|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few key challenges include:

* Different populations consume different sets of foods and beverages, so the list of items in a FFQ validated against one population may not cover all the items for the other population.
* Even when the items match in name, the methods of preparation may differ significantly enough that results from one FFQ may not be applicable to a different FFQ.
* Different populations use different languages, so the FFQ needs to be translated. Even when populations use the same language (e.g., two English-speaking countries) the jargon for specific food items can differ. Thus, for instance, in order to administer the Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ II) in Canada, a Canadian version, C-DHQ-II, was created.&lt;ref name=cdhq2/&gt;

A number of standard FFQs are available for adults in the United States.&lt;ref name=D/&gt; There is also research based on FFQs in the [[United Kingdom]],&lt;ref name=uk-dietary-assessment-review/&gt; although weighted food records are more common there.&lt;ref name=weighted-food-diary/&gt; FFQs have also been developed in [[Sweden]] and other Northern and Western European countries.&lt;ref name=north-sweden-ffq/&gt; There has been some research on FFQs in other regions, such as the Middle East and Mediterranean,&lt;ref name=lebanon-kid-ffq/&gt;&lt;ref name=mediterranean-pregnant-ffq/&gt; [[Sri Lanka]],&lt;ref name=sri-lanka-ffq/&gt; and [[Shanghai]], [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v58/n1/full/1601738a.html|pmid = 14679362|title = Validity and reproducibility of the food frequency questionnaire used in the Shanghai Women's Health Study|last = Shu|first = XO|last2 = Yang|first2 = G|last3 = Jin|first3 = F|last4 = Kushi|first4 = L|last5 = Wen|first5 = W|last6 = Gao|first6 = YT|last7 = Zheng|first7 = W|journal = [[European Journal of Clinical Nutrition]]|year = 2004|volume = 58|issue = 1|pages = 17–23|doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601738}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Analysis of data ==

=== Calculation of nutrient intake (for semi-quantitative FFQs) ===

Calculations for nutrient intake can be estimated via computerized [[software]] programs that multiply the reported frequency of each food by the amount of nutrient in a serving of that food. References databases commonly used for this purpose are listed below. Note that to estimate total nutrient intake, it is necessary to include dietary supplements in the FFQ and add the nutrient intake from these, particularly when dealing with populations where the consumption of dietary supplements is common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://dietassessmentprimer.cancer.gov/learn/questionnaire-screeners.html|title=Food Composition Databases for Food Frequency Questionnaires and Screeners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS), which in turn is based on the [[USDA National Nutrient Database]]. To incorporate the effect of dietary supplements, the USDA Dietary Supplement Integrated Database (DSID) can be used.&lt;ref name=usda-fnd-infra&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400525/Articles/JN_FoodNutrDB.pdf|title = USDA Food and Nutrient Databases Provide the Infrastructure for Food and Nutrient Research, Policy, and Practice|last = Ahuja|first = Jaspreet|last2 = Moshfegh|first2 = Alanna|last3 = Holden|first3 = Joanne|last4 = Harris|first4 = Ellen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[University of Minnesota]] Nutrition Coordinating Center (NCC)'s Food and Nutrient Database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ncc.umn.edu/food-and-nutrient-database/|title = Food and Nutrient Database|publisher = Nutrition Coordinating Center, [[University of Minnesota]]|accessdate = October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For non-quantitative FFQs, nutrient intake cannot be calculated as accurately, but the FFQ can still be used to get a rough idea of nutrient consumption.&lt;ref name=nci/&gt;

=== Calculation of food groups consumed ===

A related use of FFQs is to determine how much people consume broad groups of foods. Examples of such food groups are fruits, vegetables, and added sugars. A useful database for this purpose is the USDA's Food Patterns Equivalents Database (FPED).&lt;ref name=usda-fnd-infra/&gt;

=== Comparison data ===

In the [[United States]], data from NHANES is used to provide nationwide comparison data.&lt;ref name=D&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucdenver.edu/research/CCTSI/programs-services/ctrc/Nutrition/Documents/Food_Frequency_Questionnaires.pdf|title = Food Frequency Questionnaires|accessdate = September 20, 2016|publisher = [[University of Colorado Denver]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Population-level analyses ===

FFQs can be used for a variety of population-level analyses:

* Estimation of total consumption of specific foods, food groups, and nutrients in a population.
* Estimation of the correlation between patterns of food consumption and other non-diet variables, such as health status or specific medical conditions.
* Estimation of the effectiveness of interventions to change diet. In this experimental design, both the experiment subjects and the control group are asked to fill in the FFQ before and after the intervention, and changes in food consumption patterns for the experimental group are measured. However, because of concern about potential differential response bias due to the tendency of the intervention group to misreport their diets to a greater extent than the control group, use of an FFQ (or any self-report dietary instrument) as the sole evaluation method should be carefully considered.&lt;ref name=nci/&gt;

== Criticism ==

The low validity of FFQs has made them a subject of criticism. Walter Willett, developer of the Harvard FFQ, estimated a correlation of 0.60 to 0.70 between standard FFQs and diet recalls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/content/154/12/1100.full|last=Willett|first=Walter|authorlink = Walter Willett|title=Invited Commentary: A Further Look at Dietary Questionnaire Validation|journal = [[American Journal of Epidemiology]]|volume = 154|issue = 12|pages=1100–1102|doi=10.1093/aje/154.12.1100|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alan R. Kristal, Ulrike Peters and John D. Potter wrote in their article "Is It Time to Abandon the Food Frequency Questionnaire?" that there was not much scope to learn more from FFQs, and that a more curious and exploratory approach was needed to uncover new insights on diet and its correlation with health status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cebp.aacrjournals.org/content/14/12/2826.short|last = Kristal|first = Alan R.|last2 = Peters|first2 = Ulrike|last3 = Potter|first3 = John D.|title=Is It Time to Abandon the Food Frequency Questionnaire?|doi = 10.1158/1055-9965.EPI-12-ED1|publisher = Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention|volume = 14|issue = 12|date = December 1, 2005|journal=Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention|pages=2826–2828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Cancer Institute has argued that through careful bias correction, some of the limitations of FFQs can be overcome, and they can be very useful.&lt;ref name=nci-principles&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles and recommendations from NCI|url=https://dietassessmentprimer.cancer.gov/approach/principles.html|publisher=[[NIH]]|accessdate=6 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Forest dynamics''' describes the underlying physical and biological forces that shape and change a [[forest]] [[ecosystem]]. The continuous state of change in forests can be summarized with two basic elements: [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] and [[ecological succession|succession]].

==Disturbance==
{{See also|Disturbance (ecology)}}
'''Forest disturbances''' are events that cause change in the structure and composition of a forest ecosystem, beyond the growth and death of individual organisms. Disturbances can vary in frequency and intensity, and include natural disasters such as [[wild fire|fire]], [[landslide]]s, [[windthrow|wind]], and volcanic eruptions, outbreaks of insects, fungi, and other [[Forest pathology|pathogens]], animal-caused effects such as [[Browsing (herbivory)|grazing]] and [[trampling]], and [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] disturbances such as [[logging]], pollution, the [[clearcutting|clearing of land]] for urbanization or agriculture, and the introduction of [[invasive species]]. Not all disturbances are destructive or negative to the overall forest ecosystem. Many natural disturbances allow for renewal and growth and often release necessary nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | journal = University of Florida, IFAS Extension
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small-scale disturbances are the key to creating and maintaining diversity and heterogeneity within a forest. Small-scale disturbances are events such as single-tree blowdowns, which create [[treefall gap|gaps]] that let light through the [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] to the [[understory]] and forest floor. This available light allows early-successional shade-intolerant species to colonize and maintain a population within the dominant forest, leading to the complex spatial mosaic forest structure recognized as [[old-growth forest|old-growth]]. This process is referred to as [[patch dynamics]] or gap dynamics and has been described across many types of forests, including tropical, temperate, and boreal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | volume = 5
 | pages = 223–229
 | date = 2000
 | doi=10.1007/bf02767114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sets and patterns of natural disturbances that characterize a particular area or ecosystem are referred to as the ecosystem's ''disturbance regime''. A natural community is closely linked with its natural disturbance regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate = 26 November 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, temperate and boreal rainforests typically have a disturbance regime consisting of high-frequency but small-scale events, resulting in a highly complex forest dominated by very old trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
 | last = DellaSala
 | first = Dominick A.
 | title = Temperate and Boreal Rainforests of The World: Ecology and Conservation
 | publisher = Island Press
 | date = 2011
 | pages = 32–34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, forests that have a disturbance regime consisting of high-severity stand-replacing events, such as frequent fires, tend to be more uniform in structure and have relatively young tree stands.

==Succession==
'''Forest succession''' is the process by which species recover and regenerate after a disturbance. The type of disturbance, the climate and weather conditions, the presence of colonizing species, and the interactions among species all influence the path that succession will take.
Species diversity and composition fluctuate throughout succession. The classic model of succession is known as ''relay floristics'' and refers to a relay of dominant species. After a stand-replacing disturbance, shade-intolerant species colonize and grow into a dominant canopy, but due to their shade-intolerance they are unable to regenerate under their own canopy; the understory (composed of shade-tolerant species) gradually replaces the canopy, and due to its shade-tolerance it can regenerate under its own canopy and therefore becomes the dominant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | url = http://www.na.fs.fed.us/Spfo/Pubs/misc/ecoforest/dyn.htm
 | accessdate = 26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Often succession is not so complete or directed as the relay floristics model describes. Species can be mid-tolerant of shade and survive by taking advantage of small amounts of light coming through the canopy, and further disturbances can create small gaps. These and other factors can lead to a mixture of dominant species and a not so obvious “end” to succession ([[climax community]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Many successional trajectories follow a basic four-stage development pattern. The first of these stages, ''stand initiation'', occurs after a major disturbance and involves many species arriving in the area of abundant light and nutrients. The second stage, ''stem exclusion'', describes the growth and [[competition (biology)|competition]] of these species as resources become less available; likely one or a few species outcompetes and becomes stand-dominating. The third stage, ''understory reinitiation'', involves further disturbance and the creation of gaps; at this point stratification develops, with layers of canopy, midstory, and understory appearing. The final stage, known as ''old-growth'', is the extension and completion of the understory reinititation; a complex multi-aged and multi-layered forest has developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Considering climate change==
Forests are sensitive to climate, and so [[global warming|climate change]] can have a great effect on the dynamics of the ecosystem. Rising carbon dioxide levels can increase the productivity and growth of trees, which will then decrease as other nutrients become limiting. Changes in temperature and precipitation can affect the success of various species and the resulting species assemblage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Importance==
Forests offer many [[ecosystem services]] including [[timber]], fresh water, carbon storage, and areas of recreation. To conserve these services, along with the natural [[habitat]] and [[biodiversity]] that forests provide, understanding the dynamics that are creating and maintaining the forests is a priority. [[Forestry]] and [[silviculture]] operations require a thorough comprehension of forest dynamics in order to implement effective management and conservation techniques.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6565">A '''functional response''' in [[ecology]] is the intake rate of a [[heterotroph|consumer]] as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of [[food density]] (the amount of food available in a given [[ecotope]]). It is associated with the [[numerical response]], which is the [[reproduction]] rate of a consumer as a function of food density. Following [[C. S. Holling]], functional responses are generally classified into three types, which are called Holling's type I, II, and III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |last1=Holling |first1=C. S. |title=The components of [[predation]] as revealed by a study of small-[[mammal]] predation of the European pine sawfly |journal=The Canadian Entomologist |volume=91 |issue=5 |date=May 1959 |pages=293–320 |doi=10.4039/Ent91293-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:FunctionalResponsesGraph.svg|thumb|300px|right|Types I, II, and III functional responses]]

== Type I ==

Type I functional response assumes a linear increase in intake rate with food density, either for all food densities, or only for food densities up to a maximum, beyond which the intake rate is constant. The linear increase assumes that the time needed by the consumer to process a food item is negligible, or that consuming food does not interfere with searching for food. A functional response of type I is used in the [[Lotka–Volterra equation|Lotka–Volterra]] predator–prey model. It was the first kind of functional response described and is also the simplest of the three functional responses currently detailed.

== Type II ==

Type II functional response is characterized by a decelerating intake rate, which follows from the assumption that the consumer is limited by its capacity to process food. Type II functional response is often modeled by a [[rectangular hyperbola]], for instance as by Holling's disc equation,&lt;ref name="Holling59b"&gt;{{cite article|last1=Holling|first1=C. S.|title=Some characteristics of simple types of predation and parasitism|journal=The Canadian Entomologist|volume=91|issue=7| date=July 1959 |pages=385&amp;ndash;98|doi=10.4039/Ent91385-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; which assumes that processing of food and searching for food are mutually exclusive behaviors. The equation is
:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align} 
f(R) &amp;= \frac{a R}{1 + a h R}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Wolves killing caribou.png|thumb|upright=1.2|''Wolves killing Caribou'', by [[Arthur Robert Harding]], 1909. If the number of [[wolf|wolves]] is held constant, the number of [[caribou]] killed increases, then levels off.&lt;ref name=Dale1994/&gt;]]

where ''f'' denotes intake rate and ''R'' denotes food (or resource) density. The rate at which the consumer encounters food items per unit of food density is called the attack rate, ''a''. The average time spent on processing a food item is called the handling time, ''h''. Similar equations are the [[Monod equation]] for the growth of [[microorganism]]s and the [[Michaelis–Menten equation]] for the rate of enzymatic reactions. 

In an example with [[wolves]] and [[caribou]], as the number of caribou increases while holding wolves constant, the number of caribou kills increases and then levels off. This is because the proportion of caribou killed per wolf decreases as caribou density increases. The higher the density of caribou, the smaller the proportion of caribou killed per wolf. Explained slightly differently, at very high caribou densities, wolves need very little time to find prey and spend almost all their time handling prey and very little time searching. Wolves are then satiated and the total number of caribou kills reaches a plateau.&lt;ref name=Dale1994&gt;{{cite article |last1=Dale |first1=Bruce W. |first2=Layne G. |last2=Adams |first3=R. Terry |last3=Bowyer |title=Functional Response of Wolves Preying on Barren-Ground Caribou in a Multiple-Prey Ecosystem |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |volume=63 |year=1994 |pages=644–652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Type III ==
Type III functional response is similar to type II in that at high levels of prey density, saturation occurs.  But now, at low prey density levels, the graphical relationship of number of prey consumed and the density of the prey population is a more than linearly increasing function of prey consumed by predators.  This accelerating function is largely descriptive, and often justified by learning time, prey switching, or a combination of both phenomena, but the type III functional response lacks the rigorous theoretical underpinning of the type II functional response. 

Learning time is defined as the natural improvement of a predator’s searching and attacking efficiency or the natural improvement in their handling efficiency as prey density increases.  Imagine a prey density so small that the chance of a predator encountering that prey is extremely low.  Because the predator finds prey so infrequently, it has not had enough experience to develop the best ways to capture and subdue that species of prey.  Holling identified this mechanism in [[shrews]] and [[deer mice]] feeding on [[sawflies]].  At low numbers of sawfly cocoons per acre, deer mice especially experienced exponential growth in terms of the number of cocoons consumed per individual as the density of cocoons increased.  The characteristic saturation point of the type III functional response was also observed in the deer mice.  At a certain density of cocoons per acre, the consumption rate of the deer mice reached a saturation amount as the cocoon density continued to increase.&lt;ref name="Holling59b"/&gt;

Prey switching involves two or more prey species and one predator species.  When all prey species are at equal prey densities, the predator will indiscriminately select between prey species.  However, if the density of one of the prey species decreases, then the predator will start selecting the other, more common prey species with a higher frequency.  Murdoch demonstrated this effect with [[guppy]] preying on tubificids and [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit flies]]. As fruit fly numbers decreased guppies switched from feeding on the fruit flies on the water’s surface to feeding on the more abundant tubificids along the bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|last1=Murdoch|first1=William W.|title=Stabilizing effects of spatial heterogeneity in predator-prey systems|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|volume=11|year=1977|pages=252&amp;ndash;73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18852">The '''Global Terrorism Index''' ('''GTI''') is a report published annually by the [[Institute for Economics and Peace|Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP)]], and was developed by IT entrepreneur and IEP's founder [[Steve Killelea]].

The index provides a comprehensive summary of the key global trends and patterns in terrorism since 2000. It produces a composite score in order to provide an ordinal ranking of countries on the impact of terrorism.

It is an attempt to systematically rank the nations of the world according to [[Terrorism|terrorist]] activity. The index combines a number of factors associated with terrorist attacks to build an explicit picture of the impact of terrorism, illustrating trends, and providing a data series for analysis by researchers and policymakers.

The GTI is based on data from the [[Global Terrorism Database]] (GTD) which is collected and collated by the [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism]] (START) at the [[University of Maryland]]. The GTD has codified over 150,000 cases of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the GTI|url=http://www.visionofhumanity.org/terrorismindex/about-the-gti/|accessdate=11 February 2013|page=Vision of Humanity|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211055153/http://www.visionofhumanity.org/terrorismindex/about-the-gti/|archivedate=11 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GTI covers 163 countries, covering 99.7% of the world's population.

The aim of the report is to examine trends and to help inform a positive and practical debate about the future of terrorism and the required policy responses.

The GTI was developed in consultation with the [[Global Peace Index]] expert panel.

== Methodology ==
There is no single internationally accepted definition of what constitutes terrorism, IEP accepts the terminology and definitions agreed to by the authors of the GTD, the [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism|National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START)]] researchers and its advisory panel. The GTI therefore defines terrorism as “the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence by a non-state actor to attain a political, economic, religious, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/using-gtd/|title=Data Collection Methodology|website=www.start.umd.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition recognises that terrorism is not only the physical act of an attack, but also the psychological impact it has on a society for many years after.

In order to be included as an incident in the GTD the act has to be: “an intentional act of violence or threat of violence by a non-state actor". This means an incident has to meet three criteria in order for it to be counted as a terrorist act:

# The incident must be intentional – the result of a conscious calculation on the part of a perpetrator. 
# The incident must entail some level of violence or threat of violence — including property damage, as well as violence against people. 
# The perpetrators of the incidents must be sub-national actors. This database does not include acts of state terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/downloads/Codebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===GTI scoring system===

The GTI score for a country in a given year is based on a unique scoring system to account for the relative impact of incidents in the year. There are four factors counted in each country's yearly score:

* [[Number of terrorist incidents by country|Total number of terrorist incidents in a given year]]
* [[Number of terrorist incidents by country|Total number of fatalities caused by terrorism in a given year]]
* [[Number of terrorist incidents by country|Total number of injuries caused by terrorism in a given year]]
* The approximate level of total property damage from terrorist incidents in a given year

Each of the factors is weighted differently and a five-year weighted average is applied to importantly reflect the lingering psychological effect of terrorist acts over time. The weightings shown in the table below were determined by consultation with the GPI Expert Panel:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Dimension !! Weight
|-
| Total number of incidents || 1
|-
| Total number of fatalities || 3
|-
| Total number of injuries || 0.5
|-
| Sum of property damages measure || 2
|}

The greatest weighting is attributed to a fatality. The property damage measure is further disaggregated into four bands depending on the measured scope of the property damage inflicted by one incident. These bandings are shown in the table below, whereby incidents causing less than US$1 million are accorded a weight of 1, between $1 million and $1 billion, and more than $1 billion. A great majority of incidents are coded in the GTD as an 'unknown' level of property damage, thus scoring nil, with 'catastrophic' events being extremely rare.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Code !! Damage level
|-
| 0 || Unknown
|-
| 1 || Minor (likely &lt; $1 million)
|-
| 2 || Major (likely between $1 million and $1 billion)
|-
| 3 || Catastrophic (likely &gt; $1 billion)
|-
|}

===Example of a country's GTI score===

To assign a relative number to how a country has been directly impacted by terrorism in any given year, for every incident recorded, the GTI calculates a weighted sum of all indicators. To illustrate, the table below depicts a hypothetical country's score for a given year:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Dimension !! Weight !! # of records for the given year !! Score
|-
| Total number of incidents || 1 || 21 || 21
|-
| Total number of fatalities || 3 || 36 || 108
|-
| Total number of injuries || 0.5 || 53 || 26.5
|-
| Sum of property damages measure (depending on severity) || 0-3 || 20 || 40
|-
| '''Total raw score''' || colspan="3" style="text-align: center;" | '''195.5'''
|}

==Economic impact of terrorism==
The economic impact of terrorism is calculated using IEP's cost of violence methodology.

The model includes both the direct and indirect costs, such as the lost life-time earnings, cost of medical treatments and property destruction from incidents of terrorism. The direct costs include those borne by the victim of the terrorist act and associated expenditure, such as medical spending. The indirect costs include lost productivity and earning as well as the psychological trauma to the victims, their families and friends.

The analysis presents conservative estimates of the economic impact of terrorism and does not include variables for which detailed appropriate data was not available. For instance, the analysis does not include the impact on business, the cost of fear from terrorism or the cost of counterterrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reliefweb.int/report/world/global-terrorism-index-2016|title=Global Terrorism Index 2016|date=2016-11-17|work=ReliefWeb|access-date=2017-07-13|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global economic impact of terrorism reached US$89.6 billion in 2015, decreasing by 15 per cent from its 2014 level.

There have been three peaks in the economic impact of terrorism since the year 2000 and they are linked to the three major waves of terrorism. The first large increase in the economic impact of terrorism happened in 2001, when the attacks of [[September 11 attacks|September 11]] in [[New York City]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] took place. The second peak was in 2007 at the height of the Iraq war. The 2007 increase is mainly attributed to al-Qa'ida affiliated terrorist groups and coincided with the coalition troop surge in Iraq. The third wave started in 2012 and is still continuing, with the economic impact of terrorism peaking at US$105.6 billion in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2015/11/what-is-the-economic-impact-of-terrorism/&lt;/ref&gt; The increase in the last four years was mainly driven by increases in terrorism in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/02/Global-Terrorism-Index-2016.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012===
The first edition of Global Terrorism Index was published in 2012. The study covered analysis of 158 countries. Data showed that terrorism increased by 234 per cent from 2002 to 2011.

The 2012 report found that the global impact of terrorism increased significantly from 2002 to 2007, reaching its peak in 2007, and subsequently plateauing. The biggest rise took place over the period from 2005 to 2007 when the majority of the global increase in terrorism was driven by events in Iraq. Four other countries also significantly contributed to the global rise with Pakistan, Afghanistan, and the Philippines all experiencing increases, especially between 2007 and 2009.

Only 20 nations scored a zero for terrorist impact over the 2002-2011 period, indicating the impact of terror, while heavily concentrated in some places like Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, was widely distributed around the world.

The countries most heavily affected by terrorism in 2011 were, Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India and Yemen. Including these countries, the top ten countries affected by terrorism accounted for 87 per cent of total global incidents.

===2014===
The second edition of Global Terrorism Index was published in November 2014. The study covered analysis of 162 countries. From 2000 to 2013 there was a five-fold increase in the number of people killed by terrorism, resulting in approximately 18,000 deaths.

Of the 162 countries, 87 experienced a terrorist incident, but only 60 countries recorded one or more deaths from terrorism in 2013. Worldwide over 50 per cent of terrorist attacks claimed no fatalities and only 10 per cent claimed more than five lives. Explosives were used for 60 per cent of attacks, with firearms used in 30 per cent and 10 per cent of attacks using other weapons.

In 2013 terrorist activity increased substantially with the total number of deaths rising from 11,133 in 2012 to 17,958 in 2013, a 61 per cent increase. Over the same period, the number of countries that experienced more than 50 deaths rose from 15 to 24. This highlighted that not only was the intensity of terrorism increasing, its breadth was increasing as well.

The countries most heavily affected by terrorism in 2013 were, Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria. Four terrorist groups, ISIL, Boko Haram, the Taliban, and al-Qa'ida, claimed 66 per cent of deaths in 2013. Among OECD countries, Turkey and Mexico reported the highest deaths in 2013 losing 57 and 40 lives respectively. Since 2000, seven per cent of all terrorist incidents occurred in OECD countries.

===2015===
[[File:Global Terrorism Index 2015 by country.svg|thumb|A world map indicating the GTI by country (based on 2015 data)]]

The third edition of Global Terrorism Index was published in November 2015. The study covered analysis of 162 countries. Data from 2014 showed there has been a nine-fold increase in the number of deaths from terrorism since 2000.

Terrorist activity increased by 80 per cent in 2014 to its highest recorded level. The largest ever year-on-year increase in deaths from terrorism was recorded in 2014, rising from 18,111 in 2013 to 32,685 in 2014. Terrorism deaths spread geographically as well with the number of countries experiencing over 500 deaths increasing from five to 11.

The rise in terrorism can largely be attributed to two groups: [[ISIS]]; and [[Boko Haram]], the Nigerian jihadist group that pledged allegiance to ISIS in March 2015. Combined, these groups were responsible for 51% of all terrorism-related deaths in 2014.

In the West, lone wolf attacks account for 70 per cent of terrorist deaths since 2006. Amongst lone actors, few attacks were inspired by Islamic fundamentalism, with 80 per cent of attacks were attributed to a range of right-wing extremists, nationalists, and other types of political extremism and supremacism.

The countries most heavily affected by terrorism in 2014 were, Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Pakistan and Syria. Terrorism increased most significantly in Nigeria, where deaths increased by over 300 per cent to 7,512 fatalities.

===2016===
[[File:Global Terrorism Index 2016 by country.svg|thumb|A world map indicating the GTI by country (2016)]]
The fourth edition of Global Terrorism Index was published in November 2016. The study covered analysis of 163 countries. Overall, the global GTI score decreased by six per cent.

In 2015, the number of deaths from terrorism decreased by ten percent, the first decline since 2010. However, the 29,376 deaths recorded still rank 2015 as the second deadliest year on record. While much attention has been devoted to ISIL, the Taliban recorded its deadliest year in Afghanistan.

As with the past three years, Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, Nigeria, and Syria suffered the highest levels of terrorism, accounting for 72 per cent of all deaths from terrorism in 2015. Large decreases in fatalities in Iraq and Nigeria accounted for a large portion of the worldwide decrease.

Conversely, in OECD member countries, deaths from terrorism dramatically increased in 2015, rising by 650 per cent when compared to 2014. Twenty-one of the 34 OECD countries experienced at least one terrorist attack with the majority of deaths occurring in Turkey and France. Of attacks conducted in the United States, 98 per cent were carried out by lone actors, resulting in 156 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/global-terrorism-index-2016-developed-countries-suffer-dramatic-rise-deaths-a7419396.html|title=The 10 developed countries that have suffered the most deaths from terrorism|date=2016-11-15|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-07-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017===
The fifth edition of the Global Terrorism Index was published in November 2017. The study covered analysis of 163 countries. The global GTI scored deteriorated by four per cent from 2015 to 2016.

Overall, deaths from terrorism have fallen for the second consecutive year, resulting in a 22 per cent decrease since the peak in 2014. At an all-time high, 106 countries experienced at least one terrorist attack. Of these, 77 countries recorded at least one death, an increase from 65 countries in 2015.

Iraq, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Syria, and Pakistan remain the top five countries most affected by terrorism, however Nigeria also saw the greatest reduction in deaths. In 2016, deaths attributed to Boko Haram decreased by 80 per cent, however, deaths attributed to ISIL increased by 49 per cent. Together these five countries accounted for three quarters of all deaths from terrorism in 2016.

OECD countries have experienced a rise in terrorism, accounting for one per cent of global deaths from terrorism in 2016. In 2010 OECD countries accounted for just 0.1 per cent of deaths. Attacks in OECD countries have shifted tactics since 2014 to utilize simpler methods against non-traditional targets. Less sophisticated attacks can be executed at a lower cost and can be more difficult to detect. Positively, the first six months of 2017 have recorded 82 deaths from terrorism, lower than the 265 deaths in 2016.

'''Green Dragon''' was a  mystical Tibetan or Japanese occult Order, mentioned since the beginning of 20th century. Probably mainly the organization was popularized through the book ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]''.&lt;ref name="Lachman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lachman|first=Gary|authorlink=Gary Lachman|title=Turn Off Your Mind: The Mystic Sixties and the Dark Side of the Age of Aquarius  |publisher=[[The Disinformation Company]]|year=2003|isbn=0-9713942-3-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8jfptmqzTzkC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=utro&gt;[http://www.bibliotekar.ru/reih/21.htm Жак Бержье, Луи Повель]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''house energy rating''' (HER) is a standard measure of comparison by which one can evaluate the [[efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of a new or an existing [[building]]. The comparison is generally done for energy requirements for [[heating]] and [[cooling]] of indoor space. The energy is the main criterion considered by any international building energy rating scheme but there are some other important factors such as production of greenhouse gases emission, indoor environment quality, cost efficiency and thermal comfort, which are considered by some schemes. Basically, the energy rating of a residential building provides detailed information on the energy consumption and the relative energy efficiency of the building. Hence, HERs inform consumers about the relative energy efficiency of homes and encourage them to use this information in making their house purchase decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=kordjamshidi|first=Maria|author-link=Maria kordjamshidi|title=House rating schemes|year=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-15790-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are many energy rating tools by which one can calculate the energy performance of a building. Basically all these tools involve a numerical description or prepare a computer-based model for the rating of a building against standard occupancy and activity templates.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | journal= Energy and Building | pages = 249–254 | first=Patxi.| last=Hernandez| year=2008| title=Development of energy performance benchmarks and building energy ratings for non-domestic buildings: An example for Irish primary schools | doi= 10.1016/j.enbuild.2007.02.020 | last2= Burke | first2= Kevin | last3= Lewis | first3= J. Owen | volume= 40 | issue= 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So, HERS uses a computer-simulation based methods for assessing the energy efficiency of buildings under standard conditions and its potential for improvement.

==House energy rating scheme==
HERS is a standardized scheme for evaluation of a home's energy efficiency and expected energy costs.Basically a HERS represents the guideline of a House energy rating. In all countries, HERS show variations in objectives, assessment methodologies &amp; measurement criteria but after all this variation, the goal of all HERS is approximately same and these generate the output in same way.

===HERS outputs===
Basically HERS generates three types of outputs&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | journal= Energy  , Pages: 339-354 | first=Jeff Ross| last=Stein| year=2000| title=Accuracy of home energy rating systems | doi= 10.1016/S0360-5442(99)00072-9 | last2= Meier | first2= Alan | volume= 25 | issue= 4 | pages= 339}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1 Rating score.
* 2 Energy use/Cost prediction.
* 3 Recommendations.  
&lt;br /&gt;
# Rating Scores: The energy performance rating is a type of energy assessment how efficiently the buildings use energy, relative to similar buildings. The performance scores use generally a scale ranging from 0 to 100 or 1 to 5 stars. The value of score is based on the comparison made between the rated house and a reference house that meets a desired energy code or standards.A rating of 50 indicates average energy performance, while a rating of 75 or more indicates best performance. More the score obtained by a house more will be the energy efficiency of the house and the high rating scores have many direct applications, such as it permits a buyer to quality for more mortgage comparatively.
# Energy use/Cost prediction:HERS generate [[energy use]] and cost predictions for specific end uses like s heating/cooling, hot water and for whole house. These outputs are obtained in absolute measures and unlike to score rating these outputs can be used to compare houses like that of miles-per-gallon ratings are used to compare the cars.
# Recommendations:HERS can produce a list of recommended improvements based on some life cycle's effective cost analysis. These recommendations may be pertaining to any of the inefficient components of a building i.e. insulation layer in the composite wall of building, air conditioning equipment, water heating unit, Double-glazed windows, etc.

==HERS types==
As per the national energy policies, the HERS are known by different names in different countries. The implementation and promotion of HERS in a country depends upon the national energy policy. Beside all this, the aim of all HERS is almost same and it can be classified into three types.
# Perspective HERS : This HERS provides minimum standards for the materials, equipments and methods of efficient design and construction that must be met to qualify for an energy efficiency rating. 
# Calculation based HERS: This HERS uses computer based modeling for the prediction of energy performance relative to the requirements/standards.
# Performance based HERS:In this HERS, the energy efficiency of building is checked by comparing the actual energy consumption data against the set standards.

==Need for HERS==
Increase in [[population]], [[Economic issues]] are the some factors which have escalated the energy demand across the world. In [[developed countries]], the growth rate of energy consumption rate is 1.1%/year while in [[developing countries]] the energy consumption growth rate approximately 3 time to that of developed countries. Beside this high growth in energy consumption it also causes to increase the production of [[green house gases]] to the [[atmosphere]]. The increase in demand of energy, limited resource of convention energy sources, hike in conventional fuel prices, [[global warming]] are some important factors which Impetus us to adopt energy saving techniques and alternative sources of energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | journal= Energy and buildings , Pages: 897-905| first=Guy R.| last=Newsham| year=2009| title=Do [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-certified buildings save energy? Yes, but. | doi= 10.1016/j.enbuild.2009.03.014 | last2= Mancini | first2= Sandra | last3= Birt | first3= Benjamin J. | volume= 41 | issue= 8 | pages= 897}}&lt;/ref&gt; Building sector consumes one third of world's resources. Building currently shares approximately 40% of energy in most of the countries and are considered among the largest end-use sector. As per [[International energy agency]] (IEA) [[world energy consumption]] and green house gases level is going to increase rapidly every year. IEA recognize the building sector as one of the most cost effective sector where energy consumption can be reduced . It is estimated that the energy consumption can be reduced to 1509 million tonnes of equivalent (Mtoe) and at the same time it will cause to reduce the green house gases production up to 12.6 gigatonnes(Gt) by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iea.org/publications/freepublications/publication/buildings_certification.pdf Energy performance certification of buildings&lt;/ref&gt; The international energy outlook report reveals that the energy consumption is increasing in each year and the energy increment trends are shown in fig. 1[[File:World market past, present and future energy consumption scenario.png|thumb|right|Worlds past, present and future energy consumption scenario]].

So, we conclude that the building sector is one of the largest sector where energy consumption and green house gases emission can be reduced effectively by improving the energy efficiency of buildings and hence HERS can play a vital role in achieving all this.

==In different countries==
=== Australia ===
[[Star (classification)|Five star]] is the first house-rating scheme of [[Australia]], which was developed in 1980 by the GMI council of Australia. This scheme was basically based on the three basic elements, glass, mass and insulation of [[dwelling]]. Due to many limitation this system get failed in attaining popularity and in 1990s they develop Victorian scheme. This scheme attains some popularity but it was also not suitable for all climate of Australia.In 1993 a more flexible HERE, known by Graded five star rating system was developed. This rating scheme was much flexible and was suitable to all climatic conditions of Australia. Presently there are different HERS available in Australia which are used in different state of this country.Some of HERS used in this country are :
* NatHERS[[File:NatHERS.jpg|thumb|right|Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme]]
* AccuRate
* FirstRate
* Quick Rate 
* BERS
* Q Rare

=== Brazil ===
In [[Brazil]], the first national program for energy efficiency in buildings (HERS), PROCEL EDIFICA was developed in 2003.The use of this rating scheme was extended to public and commercial sector in 2007 and from 2012 the operational rating is mandatory for both residential and commercial buildings. The rating system consist of a scale ranging from A to E basis, where A represent the most efficient and E represent the least efficient rating. The rating scheme consider three aspects of buildings;
*1) Building envelop thermal performance
*2) Lighting system efficiency
*3) Installed power and air conditioning system efficiency
The three groups are evaluate individually and the combined results of these indicates the level of efficiency of a building.

===Canada===
Home energy ratings in [[Canada]] have been in existence since 1997. The two government energy rating programs in Canada are
* Ener Guide for houses (EGH) 
* Ener guide for new houses (EGNH)
Both of these programs use HOT2XP and HOT 2000 as their rating tools.
Beside the aforesaid government rating programs in Canada, there are two standard bases are available for evaluating the building are;
*1) R-2000: as per this rating, 80-85 points are needed to meet Canadian specification code. 
*2) Model national energy code of Canada (MNECB): as per this rating, 70-75 points are needed to meet Canadian specification code.  
* Other HERS in Canada 
LEED is used in Canada as one of home rating scheme. This rating scheme is an adaption of the US green building council’s LEED and has been modified as per the Canadian climate, construction and regulation policies.

===[[China]]===
In China, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (MOHURD) develop a national building energy rating and labeling HERS in 2008. This HERS is mandatory for government buildings, big commercial complexes and those buildings applying for public retrofit funding or green label. this HERS consist a star rating scheme, ranging from 1 to 5 star. As per this HERS, more the star, more will be the energy efficiency of the building. The rating level of buildings is determined in three parameters;
*1) Basic Items : refers to the regulated energy use per square meter, obtained by [[computer modeling]] or measurements.
*2) Required Items : refers to minimum performance requirements for building envelop and Heating Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC).
*3) Optional Items : refers to the additional energy management system which are not mandatory in the rating scheme. it covers, the application of [[renewable energy]], innovative energy efficient technologies.

===[[Denmark]]===
In Denmark, the energy rating scheme are in existence since 1981. Denmark is the first country in Europe(EU) to begin issuing Energy Performance certificates (EPCs). The EPCs are mandatory in all types of buildings in Denmark. The rating system in Denmark includes three parts.
# The first part of rating consists reports on water consumption, energy consumption and GHGs emission per year, which are compared against a standard building of same type on a scale ranging from A1-C5.
# Second part of the system, proposes the different possible ways for saving of energy and water consumption with respect to the cost involved
# This part of report provides the present state of buildings in term of size, heating system, energy usage and the cost of energy and heating.

===France===
In France, "Diagnostic de performance energetique" (DPE) is used as HERS. This scheme was developed in November 2006 and in July 2007 its use becomes mandatory for all those buildings whose registration had been filed after 1 July 2007. This rating scheme consist of two types of measurements.
* Energy consumption 
* Greenhouse gas emission
Both of the measurements comprises 7-label ratings, ranging from A (best) to G (worst) which are presented by the color coding. In ratings, the green color represents A and red color represents G label. In both cases of measurements, the buildings are evaluated in terms of necessary resource for heating, hot water production and air conditioning. The PDE of a building remains valid for 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://uniondesconsommateurs.ca/docu/energie/EEratingHouses.pdf FOR ENERGY EFFICIENCY(EE):A HomeEnergy Rating System&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In [[Ireland]], the building energy ratings are in existence since 2007. In this country Building Energy Rating (BER) is used as EPC.  The scheme was mandatory for new dwelling and in 2008, its use was extended to non-residential and public buildings, in 2009 the HERS cover the all types of buildings.  BER is a calculation based HERS.  Due to transparency in this HERS, there is a more awareness among the people and is accepted widely.

===Portugal===
In [[Portugal]], the EPCs scheme was launched in July 2007 and was implemented for new buildings. The use of this scheme was extended to existing buildings in January 2009. This rating scheme covers mainly the indoor air quality and energy performance of the buildings. This rating scheme is also a calculation based HERS. The compliance in the country is high and the EPC is issued only when 90% of building completion and transaction observed. There is a national database who covers all EPCs registration record and this is available for all countrymen.

===United Kingdom===
The [[United Kingdom]] (UK) is one of the countries where HERS has been developed and implemented strongly from a very long time ago. In UK, Currently National Home Energy Rating (NHER) scheme is used widely. NHER scheme measure the [[thermal efficiency]] of the dwellings on a scale of 0-10 in terms of energy running cost. The dwelling rating is done through computer modeling which uses a computer program based on Building Research Establishment Domestic Energy Model (BREDEM). Basically NHER measure the energy efficiency of dwellings as a function of energy cost per square meter.The energy usage is calculated by considering the all aspects of buildings (location, design, construction, water heating, cooking, ventilation and appliances, lighting etc.) and for dwelling energy rating it use some standard assumptions, such as occupancy scenario, thermostat setting, occupant stay timings.

===United States===
In the US, HERS are since 1980s.  Among the various HERS energy rated homes of America is used widely.  It is used in more than 18 states of US.  This scheme uses a 100 points scale of efficiency and it is further divided into 10 categories of star rating which ranges from [[Star (classification)|one star]] to [[Star (classification)|five star]] plus. In this rating scheme a higher star rated house represents higher energy efficiency of the house. [[File:Energy star.jpg|thumb|right|ENERGY STAR]] 
The energy efficiency rating in this HERS represents the predicted energy consumption, represents the form of normalized annual energy consumption. This rating scheme consist a detailed measure of CFLs, water heater tanks, ceiling, floors and pipe [[Thermal insulation|insulation]], efficient refrigerator and freezer, high efficient space and water heating equipments, air leakage and controls. 
The other important rating schemes used in US are.:&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=kordjamshidi|first=Maria|author-link=Maria kordjamshidi|title=House rating schemes:from energy to comfort base|year=2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-15790-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Industrial and organizational psychology''' ('''I/O psychology'''), which is also known as occupational psychology, organizational psychology, and work and organizational psychology, is an applied discipline within [[psychology]]. I/O psychology is the science of human behaviour relating to work and applies psychological theories and principles to organizations and individuals in their places of work as well as the individual's work-life more generally.&lt;ref&gt;Truxillo, D. M., Bauer, T. N., &amp; Erdogan, B. (2016).  Psychology and Work:  Perspectives on Industrial and Organizational Psychology.  New York:  Psychology Press-Taylor &amp; Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; I/O [[psychologist]]s are trained in the [[scientist–practitioner model]]. They contribute to an organization's success by improving the performance, [[motivation]], [[job satisfaction]], and [[occupational safety and health]] as well as the overall [[health]] and [[well-being]] of its employees.  An I/O psychologist conducts research on employee behaviours and attitudes, and how these can be improved through hiring practices, training programs, feedback, and management systems.&lt;ref&gt;''Building Better Organizations'' Brochure published by the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology. Retrieved from [http://www.siop.org/visibilitybrochure/memberbrochure.aspx SIOP.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, I/O psychology is one of the 16 recognized specialties by the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.apa.org/ed/graduate/specialize/recognized.aspx |title=Recognized Specialties and Proficiencies in Professional Psychology |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=n.d. |website=American Psychological Association |publisher=American Psychological Association |access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is represented by Division 14 of the APA, and was formally known as the [[Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology]] (SIOP). In the United Kingdom, industrial and organizational psychologists are referred to as occupational psychologists. Occupational psychology in the UK is one of nine 'protected titles' within the profession "practitioner psychologist" regulated by the [[Health and Care Professions Council]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hpc-uk.org/aboutregistration/protectedtitles/ HPC – Health Professions Council – Protected titles]. Hpc-uk.org. Retrieved on 2013-09-01.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, graduate programs in psychology, including occupational psychology, are accredited by the [[British Psychological Society]].

In Australia, the title organizational psychologist is protected by law, and regulated by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). Organizational psychology is one of nine areas of specialist endorsement for psychology practice in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologyboard.gov.au/Endorsement.aspx |title=Psychology Board of Australia – Endorsement |publisher=Psychologyboard.gov.au |date=2010-07-01 |accessdate=2013-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe someone with a specialist [[EuroPsy]] Certificate in Work and Organisational Psychology is a fully qualified psychologist and an expert in the work psychology field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.europsy-efpa.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial and organizational psychologists reaching the EuroPsy standard are recorded in the Register of European Psychologists and industrial and organizational psychology is one of the three main psychology specializations in Europe.

==Historical overview==
The historical development of I/O psychology was paralleled in the US, the UK,&lt;ref&gt;Chimiel, N. (2000). History and context for work and organizational psychology. In N. Chmiel (Ed.), ''Introduction to work and organizational psychology :A European perspective''. Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia, Germany, the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;Shimmin, S., &amp; van Strien, P. J. (1998). History of the psychology of work and organization. In P. J. D. Drenth, H. Thierry, &amp; C. J. de Wolff (Eds.), ''Handbook of work and organizational psychology'' (pp. 71–99). Hove, U.K.: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and eastern European countries such as Romania.&lt;ref&gt;Pitariu, H. D. (19912). I/O psychology in Romania: Past, present and intentions. ''The Industrial-Organizational Psychologist, 29''(4), 29–33.&lt;/ref&gt; The roots of I/O psychology trace back nearly to the beginning of psychology as a science, when [[Wilhelm Wundt]] founded one of the first psychological laboratories in 1879 in Leipzig, Germany. In the mid 1880s, Wundt trained two psychologists, [[Hugo Münsterberg]] and [[James McKeen Cattell]], who had a major influence on the emergence of I/O psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Landy, F. J. (1997). Early influences on the development of industrial and organizational psychology. Journal of Applied Psychology, 82, 467–477.&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of viewing performance differences as human "errors", Cattell was one of the first to recognize the importance of differences among individuals as a way of better understanding work behavior. [[Walter Dill Scott]], who was a contemporary of Cattell, was elected President of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) in 1919, was arguably the most prominent I/O psychologist of his time. Scott, along with [[Walter Van Dyke Bingham]], worked at the [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Institute of Technology]], developing methods for selecting and training sales personnel.&lt;ref&gt;Feruson, L. (1965). ''The heritage of industrial psychology''. Hartford, CT: Finlay Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "industrial" side of I/O psychology originated in research on individual differences, [[Industrial &amp; Organizational Assessment|assessment]], and the prediction of work performance. Industrial psychology crystallized during World War I, in response to the need to rapidly assign new troops to duty. Scott and Bingham volunteered to help with the testing and placement of more than a million army recruits. In 1917, together with other prominent psychologists, they adapted a well-known intelligence test the [[Stanford–Binet]], which was designed for testing one individual at a time, to make it suitable for group testing. The new test was called the [[Army Alpha]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

After the War, the growing industrial base in the US was a source of momentum for what was then called industrial psychology.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Private industry set out to emulate the successful testing of army personnel.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Mental ability testing soon became commonplace in the work setting.

[[Elton Mayo]] found that rest periods improved morale and reduced turnover in a Philadelphia textile factory.&lt;ref&gt;Mayo, E. (1924). Recovery and industrial fatigue. ''Journal of Personnel Research, 3'', 273–281.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griffin,  M.  A., Landy,  F.  J., &amp; Mayocchi, L. (2002). Australian influences on Elton Mayo: The construct of revery in industrial society. ''History of Psychology, 5''(4), 356–375.&lt;/ref&gt; He later joined the ongoing [[Hawthorne studies]], where he became interested in how workers' emotions and informal relationships affected productivity. The results of these studies ushered in the [[human relations movement]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

[[World War II]] brought renewed interest in ability testing (to accurately place recruits in new technologically advanced military jobs), the introduction of the assessment center, and concern with morale and fatigue in war industry workers.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The industrial psychology division of the former American Association of Applied Psychology became a division within APA,&lt;ref name="Kopes"&gt;Kopes, L. L. (2006). A brief history of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology. Accessed June 3, 2013. [http://www.siop.org/History/History.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; becoming Division 14 of APA. It was initially called the Industrial and Business Psychology Division. In 1962, the name was changed to the Industrial Psychology Division. In 1973, it was renamed again, this time to the Division of Industrial and Organizational Psychology. In 1982, the unit become more independent of APA, and its name was changed again, this time to the [[Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology]].&lt;ref name="Kopes"/&gt;

The name change of the division from "industrial psychology" to "industrial and organizational psychology" reflected the shift in the work of industrial psychologists who had originally addressed work behavior from the individual perspective, examining performance and attitudes of individual workers. Their work became broader. Group behavior in the workplace became a worthy subject of study.&lt;ref name="Kopes"/&gt; The emphasis on "organizational" underlined the fact that when an individual joins an organization (e.g., the organization that hired him or her), he or she will be exposed to a common [[goal]] and a common set of operating procedures.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} In the 1970s in the UK, references to occupational psychology became more common than I/O psychology.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

According to Bryan and Vinchur, "while organizational psychology increased in popularity through [the 1960s and 1970s], research and practice in the traditional areas of industrial psychology continued, primarily driven by employment legislation and case law" (p.&amp;nbsp;53).&lt;ref name = "Bryan"&gt;Bryan, L. L. K., &amp; Vinchur, A.J. (2012). A history of industrial and organizational psychology. S. W. J. Kozlowski (Ed.), ''The Oxford handbook of organizational psychology'' (pp. 22-75). New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a focus on fairness and validity in selection efforts as well as in the job analyses that undergirded selection instruments. For example, i/o psychology showed increased interest in [[behaviorally anchored rating scales]].&lt;ref name = "Bryan"/&gt; What critics there were of i/o psychology accused the discipline of being responsive only to the concerns of managements.&lt;ref name = "Bryan"/&gt;

From the 1980 to 2010s other changes in i/o psychology took place. Researchers increasingly adopted a multi-level approach, attempting to understand behavioral phenomena from both the level of the organization and the level of the individual worker.&lt;ref name = "Bryan"/&gt; There was also an increased interest in the needs and expectations of employees as individuals. For example, an emphasis on organizational justice and the psychological contract took root, as well as the more traditional concerns of selection and training.&lt;ref name = "Bryan"/&gt; Methodological innovations (e.g., [[meta-analyses]], [[structural equation modeling]]) were adopted. With the passage of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|American with Disabilities Act]] in 1990 and parallel legislation elsewhere in the world, i/o psychology saw an increased emphasis on "fairness in personnel decisions."&lt;ref name = "Bryan"/&gt; Training research relied increasingly on advances in [[educational psychology]] and [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name = "Bryan"/&gt;

==Research methods==

As described above, I/O psychologists are trained in the [[scientist–practitioner model]]. I/O psychologists rely on a variety of methods to conduct organizational research. Study designs employed by I/O psychologists include [[statistical survey|surveys]], [[experiment]]s, [[quasi-experiments]], and [[observational studies]]. I/O psychologists rely on diverse data sources including human judgments, historical databases, objective measures of work performance (e.g., sales volume), and questionnaires and surveys.

I/O researchers employ quantitative statistical methods. [[Quantitative methods]] used in I/O psychology include [[correlation]], [[multiple regression]], and [[analysis of variance]]. More advanced statistical methods employed in I/O research include [[logistic regression]], [[structural equation modeling]],&lt;ref&gt;Hayduk, L.A. (1987). ''Structural equations modeling with LISREL.'' Baltimore, MD: Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hierarchical linear modeling]] (HLM; also known as [[multilevel modeling]]).&lt;ref&gt;Raudenbush, S.W. &amp; Bryk, A.S. (2001). ''Hierarchical linear models: Applications and data analysis methods'' (2nd ed.). Newbury Park, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; I/O research has also employed [[meta-analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, J.E. &amp; Schmidt, F.L. (1990). ''Methods of meta-analysis: Correcting error and bias in research findings.'' Thousand Oaks, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, J.E. &amp; Schmidt, F.L. (1994). Estimation of sampling error variance in the meta-analysis of correlations: Use of average correlation in the homogeneous case. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', 79, 171–77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, R. &amp; DiMatteo, M.R. (2002). Meta-analysis. In H. Pashler &amp; J. Wixted (Eds.). ''Stevens' handbook of experimental psychology'' (3rd ed.), Vol. 4: Methodology in experimental psychology, pp. 391–428. Hoboken, NJ, US: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; I/O psychologists also employ [[psychometric]] methods including methods associated with [[classical test theory]],&lt;ref&gt;Nunnally, J. &amp; Bernstein, I. (1994). ''Psychometric theory'' (3rd ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; [[generalizability theory]], and [[item response theory]] (IRT).&lt;ref&gt;Du Toit, M. (2003) ''IRT from SSI.'' Mooresville, IN: Scientific Software.&lt;/ref&gt;

I/O psychologists have also employed [[qualitative methods]], which largely involve [[focus groups]], [[interviews]], and [[case studies]]. I/O research on organizational culture research has employed [[ethnographic]] techniques and [[participant observation]]. A qualitative technique associated with I/O psychology is Flanagan's [[Critical Incident Technique]].&lt;ref&gt;Flanagan, J.C. (1954). The Critical Incident Technique. ''Psychological Bulletin, 51'', 327–58.&lt;/ref&gt; I/O psychologists sometimes use quantitative and qualitative methods in concert.&lt;ref&gt;Rogelberg, S. G., &amp; Brooks-Laber, M. E. (2002). Securing our collective duture: Challenges facing those designing and doing research in industrial and organization psychology. In S. G. Rogelberg (Ed.). ''Handbook of research methods in industrial and organizational psychology'' (pp. 479 – 485). Cambridge, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; OHP researchers have also combined and coordinated quantitative and qualitative methods within a single study.&lt;ref&gt;Elfering, A., Grebner, S., Semmer, N.K., Kaiser-Freiburghaus, D., Lauper-Del Ponte, S., &amp; Witschi, I. (2005). Chronic job stressors and job control: Effects on event-related coping success and well-being. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 78'', 237–252.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics{{anchor|Topics in industrial-organizational psychology}}==

===Job analysis===
{{main|Job analysis}}
Job analysis encompasses a number of different methods.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} It primarily involves the systematic collection of information about a job. A task-oriented job analysis involves an examination of the duties, tasks, and/or competencies required by the job being assessed. By contrast, a worker-oriented job analysis involves an examination of the knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics (KSAOs) required to successfully perform the work. Information obtained from job analyses are used for many purposes, including the creation of job-relevant selection procedures, [[performance appraisals]] and the criteria they require, and the development of training programs.

===Personnel recruitment and selection===
{{main|Personnel selection}}
I/O psychologists typically work with human resource specialists to design (a) recruitment processes and (b) personnel selection systems.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Personnel [[recruitment]] is the process of identifying qualified candidates in the workforce and getting them to apply for jobs within an organization. Personnel recruitment processes include developing job announcements, placing ads, defining key qualifications for applicants, and screening out unqualified applicants.

Personnel selection is the systematic process of hiring and promoting personnel. Personnel selection systems employ evidence-based practices to determine the most qualified candidates. Personnel selection involves both the newly hired and individuals who can be promoted from within the organization. Common selection tools include ability tests (e.g., cognitive, physical, or psycho-motor), knowledge tests, [[personality tests]], structured [[interviews]], the systematic collection of biographical data, and work samples. I/O psychologists must evaluate evidence regarding the extent to which selection tools predict job performance.

Personnel selection procedures are usually validated, i.e., shown to be job relevant to personnel selection, using one or more of the following types of validity: [[content validity]], [[construct validity]], and/or [[criterion validity|criterion-related validity]]. I/O psychologists must adhere to professional standards in personnel selection efforts. SIOP (e.g., ''Principles for validation and use of personnel selection procedures''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siop.org/_Principles/principles.pdf ''The SIOP principles'']&lt;/ref&gt;) and APA together with the [[National Council on Measurement in Education]] (e.g., ''Standards for educational and psychological testing''&lt;ref&gt;[''The standards for educational and psychological testing'' http://www.apa.org/science/programs/testing/standards.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; are sources of those standards. The [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]'s ''Uniform guidelines''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uniformguidelines.com/ ''Uniform guidelines on eemployee selection procedures'']&lt;/ref&gt; are also influential in guiding personnel selection decisions.

A meta-analysis of selection methods found that [[g factor (psychometrics)|general mental ability]] was the best overall predictor of job performance and attainment in training.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, F.L., &amp; Hunter, J.E. (1998). The validity and utility of selection methods in personnel psychology: Practical and theoretical implications of 85 years of research findings. ''Psychological Bulletin, 124''(2), 262–74. [http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1998-10661-006&amp;CFID=5257837&amp;CFTOKEN=93267042]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance appraisal/management===
{{main|Performance appraisal|Performance management}}
Performance appraisal or [[performance evaluation]] is the process in which an individual's or a group's work behaviors and outcomes are assessed against managers' and others' expectations for the job.&lt;ref name = "Miner"&gt;Miner, J.B. (1992). ''Industrial-organizational psychology.'' New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Performance appraisal is frequently used in promotion and compensation decisions, to help design and validate personnel selection procedures, and for performance management. Performance management is the process of providing performance feedback relative to expectations, and information relevant to improvement (e.g., coaching, mentoring). Performance management may also include documenting and tracking performance information for organizational evaluation purposes.

An I/O psychologist would typically use information from the job analysis to determine a job's performance dimensions, and then construct a [[rating scale]] to describe each level of performance for the job.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Often, the I/O psychologist would be responsible for training organizational personnel how to use the performance appraisal instrument, including ways to minimize bias when using the rating scale, and how to provide effective performance feedback.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===Individual assessment and psychometrics===
{{main|Individual assessment|Psychometrics}}
[[Individual assessment]] involves the measurement of [[individual differences]]. I/O psychologists perform individual assessments in order to evaluate differences among candidates for employment as well as differences among employees.&lt;ref name="A and U"&gt;Anastasi, A., &amp; Urbina, S. (1997). ''Psychological testing. 7th ed.'' Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; The constructs measured pertain to job performance. With candidates for employment, individual assessment is often part of the personnel selection process. These assessments can include written tests, aptitude tests, physical tests, psycho-motor tests, [[personality test]]s, integrity and reliability tests, work samples, [[simulation]]s, and [[assessment centre]]s.&lt;ref name="A and U"/&gt;

===Occupational health and well-being===

I/O psychologists are concerned with occupational health and [[well-being]]. Early in the 20th century [[Arthur Kornhauser]] examined the impact on productivity of hiring mentally unstable workers.&lt;ref name="Zickar"&gt;Zickar, M. J. (2003). Remembering Arthur Kornhauser: Industrial psychology’s advocate for worker well-being. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 88'', 363–369. doi:10.1037/0021-9010.88.2.363&lt;/ref&gt; Kornhauser also examined the link between industrial working conditions and mental health as well as the spillover into a worker's personal life of having an unsatisfying job.&lt;ref&gt;Kornhauser, A. (1965). ''Mental health of the industrial worker''. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowling, K. 2010"&gt;Bowling, K., Eschleman, J., &amp;  Wang, Q (2010). A meta-analytic examination of the relationship between [[job satisfaction]] and subjective well-being. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 83''(4), 915–934.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liljegren, M. 2009"&gt;Liljegren, M., &amp; Ekberg, K. (2009). Job mobility as predictor of health and burnout. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 82''(2), 317–329.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, I/O researchers have found that staying vigorous during working hours is associated with better work-related behaviour and subjective well-being as well as more effective functioning in the family domain.&lt;ref name = "Sonnen2008"&gt;Sonnentag, S., &amp; Niessen, C. (2008). Staying vigorous until work is over: The role of trait vigour, day-specific work experiences and recovery. ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 81''(3), 435–458.&lt;/ref&gt; Trait vigor and recovery experiences after work were related to vigor at work.&lt;ref name = "Sonnen2008"/&gt; Job satisfaction has also been found to be associated with [[life satisfaction]], happiness, well-being and positive affect, and the absence of [[negative affect]].&lt;ref name="Bowling, K. 2010"/&gt;  Other research indicates that among older workers activities such as volunteering and participating in social clubs was related to a decrease in depressive symptoms over the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;Potočnik, K., &amp; Sonnentag, S., &amp; Niessen, C. (2008). A longitudinal study of well-being in older workers and retirees: The role of engaging in different types of activities.

===Workplace bullying, aggression and violence===
{{main|Workplace bullying|Workplace aggression|Workplace violence}} 
I/O psychologists are concerned with the related topics of workplace bullying, aggression, and violence.&lt;ref&gt;Coyne, I., Garvin, F. (2013). Employee relations and motivation. In Lewis, R., &amp;  Zibarris, R. (Eds.), Work and Occupational Psychology: Integrating Theory and Practice. Sage&lt;/ref&gt; For example, I/O research found that exposure to workplace violence elicited ruminative thinking, and ruminative thinking, in turn, is associated with poor well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Niven, K., Sprigg, C., Armitage, J., &amp; Satchwell, A . (2013). Ruminative thinking exacerbates the negative effects of workplace violence ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 86(1), 67–84.&lt;/ref&gt; I/O research has found that interpersonal aggressive behaviours is associated with worse team performance.&lt;ref&gt;Aube, C, &amp; Rousseau, V . (2011). Interpersonal aggression and team effectiveness: The mediating role of team goal commitment ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 84(3), 565–580.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remuneration and compensation===
{{main|Remuneration}}
Compensation includes wages or salary, bonuses, pension/retirement contributions, and [[employee benefits]] that can be converted to cash or replace living expenses. I/O psychologists may be asked to conduct a [[job evaluation]] for the purpose of determining compensation levels and ranges. I/O psychologists may also serve as [[expert witness]]es in pay discrimination cases, when disparities in pay for similar work are alleged by employees.

===Training and training evaluation===
{{main|Training}}
Training involves the systematic teaching of skills, concepts, or attitudes that results in improved performance in another environment.&lt;ref name="Goldstein, I. L. 2002"&gt;Goldstein, I. L., &amp; Ford, J. K. (2002). ''Training in organizations: Needs assessment, development, and evaluation'' (4th ed). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt; Because many people hired for a job are not already versed in all the tasks the job requires, training may be needed to help the individual perform the job effectively. Evidence indicates that training is often effective, and that it succeeds in terms of higher net sales and gross profitability per employee.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur, W., Bennett, W., Edens, P.S., &amp; Bell, S.T. (2003). Effectiveness of training in organizations: A meta-analysis of design and evaluation features. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 88'', 234–245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to performance management (see above), an I/O psychologist would employ a [[job analysis]] in concert with the application of the principles of [[instructional design]] to create an effective training program.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} A training program is likely to include a [[summative evaluation]] at its conclusion in order to ensure that trainees have met the training objectives and can perform the target work tasks at an acceptable level. Training programs often include [[formative assessments|formative evaluations]] to assess the effect of the training as the training proceeds. Formative evaluations can be used to locate problems in training procedures and help I/O psychologists make corrective adjustments while training is ongoing.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

The foundation for training programs is [[learning]]. Learning outcomes can be organized into three broad categories: cognitive, skill-based, and affective outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;Kraiger, K., Ford, J. K., &amp; Salas, E. (1993). Application of cognitive, skill-based, and affective theories of learning outcomes to new methods of training evaluation. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 78'', 311 – 328.&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive training is aimed at instilling declarative knowledge or the knowledge of rules, facts, and principles (e.g., police officer training covers laws and court procedures). Skill-based training aims to impart procedural knowledge (e.g., skills needed to use a special tool) or technical skills (e.g., understanding the workings of software program). Affective training concerns teaching individuals to develop specific attitudes or beliefs that predispose trainees to behave a certain way (e.g., show commitment to the organization, appreciate diversity).&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, J. P., McCloy, R. A., Oppler, S.H., &amp; Sager, C. E. (1993). A theory of performance. In N. Schmitt &amp; W. C. Borman (Eds.), ''Personnel selection in organizations'' (pp. 35–70). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[needs assessment]], an analysis of corporate and individual goals, is often undertaken prior to the development of a training program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schultz|first=Duane P. Schultz, Sydney Ellen|title=''Psychology and work today: An introduction to industrial and organizational psychology''|year=2010|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|isbn=0-205-68358-4|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|page=164}} In addition, a careful [[needs analysis]] is required in order to develop a systematic understanding of where training is needed, what should be taught, and who will be trained.&lt;ref name="Goldstein, I. L. 2002"/&gt; A [[training needs analysis]] typically involves a three-step process that includes [[organizational analysis]], [[task analysis]] and person analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Dierdorff, E. C., &amp; Surface, E. A. (2008). Assessing training needs: Do work experience and capability matter? Human Performance, 21, 28–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

An organizational analysis is an examination of organizational goals and resources as well as the organizational environment.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The results of an organizational analysis help to determine where training should be directed. The analysis identifies the training needs of different departments or subunits.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} It systematically assesses manager, peer, and technological support for [[transfer of training]]. An organizational analysis also takes into account the [[organisation climate|climate]] of the organization and its subunits. For example, if a climate for safety is emphasized throughout the organization or in subunits of the organization (e.g., production), then training needs will likely reflect an emphasis on safety.&lt;ref&gt;Zohar, D. (2002a). Modifying supervisory practices to improve subunit safety: A leadership-based intervention model. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 87'', 587–596.&lt;/ref&gt; A task analysis uses the results of a job analysis to determine what is needed for successful job performance, contributing to training content. With organizations increasingly trying to identify "core competencies" that are required for all jobs, task analysis can also include an assessment of competencies.&lt;ref&gt;Shippmann, J. S. et al. (2000). The practice of competency modeling. ''Personnel Psychology, 53'', 703–740.&lt;/ref&gt; A person analysis identifies which individuals within an organization should receive training and what kind of instruction they need. Employee needs can be assessed using a variety of methods that identify weaknesses that training can address.

===Motivation in the workplace===
{{main|Work motivation}}
Work motivation reflects the energy an individual applies "to initiate work-related behavior, and to determine its form, direction, intensity, and duration"&lt;ref name="Pin"&gt;Pinder, C. C.(2008). ''Work motivation in organizational behavior'' (2nd edition). New York: Psychology Press&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding what motivates an organization's employees is central to I/O psychology. [[Motivation]] is generally thought of as a theoretical construct that fuels behavior. An [[incentive]] is an anticipated reward that is thought to incline a person to behave a certain way.&lt;ref name="Dec"&gt;Deckers, L. (2010). ''Motivation: Biological, psychological and environmental'' (3rd ed., pp. 2–3). Boston, MA: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; Motivation varies among individuals. Studying its influence on behavior, it must be examined together with ability and environmental influences. Because of motivation's role in influencing workplace behavior and performance, many organizations structure the work environment to encourage productive behaviors and discourage unproductive behaviors.&lt;ref name="jex"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;Mitchell, T.R.; Daniels, D. 2003. Motivation. ''Handbook of Psychology'', Vol. 12. Industrial Organizational Psychology, ed. W.C. Borman, D.R. Ilgen, R.J. Klimoski, pp. 225–54. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;

Motivation involves three psychological processes: arousal, direction, and intensity.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Arousal is what initiates action. It is often fueled by a person's need or desire for something that is missing from his or her life, either totally or partially. Direction refers to the path employees take in accomplishing the goals they set for themselves. Intensity is the amount of energy employees put into goal-directed work performance. The level of intensity often reflects the importance and difficulty of the goal. These psychological processes involve four factors.  First, motivation serves to direct attention, focusing on particular issues, people, tasks, etc. Second, it serves to stimulate effort. Third, motivation influences persistence. Finally, motivation influences the choice and application of task-related strategies.&lt;ref name=Mitchell/&gt;

===Occupational stress===
{{main|Occupational stress}}
I/O psychologists are involved in the research and the practice of occupational stress and design of individual and organizational interventions to manage and reduce the stress levels and increase productivity, performance, health and wellbeing.&lt;ref&gt;Vinchur, A.J, &amp; Koppes, L.L.

Sinangil, (Eds.), ''Handbook of industrial, work and organizational psychology, Vol. 2, Organizational Psychology'' (pp.93–115). Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational stress can have implications for organizational performance because of the emotions job stress evokes.

===Organizational culture===
{{main|Organizational culture}}
Organizational culture has been described as a set of assumptions shared by individuals in an organization; the assumptions influence the interpretation and actions that define appropriate behavior for various situations.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} Organizational culture has been shown to affect important organizational outcomes such as performance, attraction, recruitment, retention, employee satisfaction, and employee well-being.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} There are three levels of organizational culture: artifacts, shared values, and basic beliefs and assumptions.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Artifacts comprise the physical components of the organization that relay cultural meaning. Shared values are individuals' preferences regarding certain aspects of the organization's culture (e.g., loyalty, customer service). Basic beliefs and assumptions include individuals' impressions about the trustworthiness and supportiveness of an organization, and are often deeply ingrained within the organization's culture.

In addition to an overall culture, organizations also have subcultures.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Examples of subcultures include corporate culture, departmental culture, local culture, and issue-related culture.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} While there is no single "type" of organizational culture, some researchers have developed models to describe different organizational cultures.

===Group behavior===
{{main|Group behavior}}
Group behavior involves the interactions among individuals in a collective. The individuals' [[opinions]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], and adaptations affect group behavior and group behavior, in turn, affects those opinions, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Goldstone, R., Roberts, M., &amp; Gureckis, T. (2008). Emergent processes of group behavior. ''Group Behavior, 17'', 1–15.&lt;/ref&gt; The interactions are thought to fulfill some need satisfaction in an individual who is part of the collective.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; A specific area of I/O research in group behavior is the team dynamics and team effectiveness.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

====Team effectiveness====
{{main|Team effectiveness}}
Organizations often organize teams because teams can accomplish a much greater amount of work in a short period of time than an individual can accomplish.&lt;ref name=jex/&gt; I/O research has examined the harm workplace aggression does to team performance.&lt;ref&gt;Rousseau, V. &amp;  Aube, C. (2011). Interpersonal aggression and team effectiveness: The mediating role of team goal commitment ''Journal of Occupational and Organizational Psychology, 84''(3), 565–580.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Team composition====
The selection of individuals to be assigned to specific teams bears on the resulting effectiveness of those teams. Aspects of team composition that should be considered during the team selection process include team members' knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) as well their personalities and attitudes.&lt;ref name=jex/&gt; To achieve high-quality results, teams built with members having higher skill levels are more likely to be effective than teams built around members having lesser skills; teams that include a members with a diversity of skills are also likely to show improved team performance.&lt;ref&gt;Guzzo, R.A., &amp; Shea, G.P. (1992). Group performance and intergroup relations in organizations. ''Handbook of industrial and organizational psychology'' (Vol. 3, pp. 269–313).

(1990). Work teams: Applications and effectiveness. ''American Psychologist, 45''(2), 120–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Team members' personalities and attitudes have also been studied. For example, the personality factors agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and emotional stability are related to better team performance.&lt;ref&gt;Van Vianen, A.E.M. &amp; De Dreu, C.K.W. (2001). Personality in teams: Its relationship to social cohesion, task cohesion, and team performance. ''European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology, 10''(2), 97–120.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Barrick"/&gt;

====Task design====
{{main|Job design}}
A fundamental question in team task design is whether or not a task is even appropriate for a team. Those tasks that require predominantly independent work are best left to individuals, and team tasks should include those tasks that consist primarily of interdependent work.&lt;ref name=jex&gt;Jex, S.M. &amp; Britt, T.W. (2008). ''Organizational psychology.'' Hoboken, New Jersey: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; When a given task is appropriate for a team, task design can play a key role in team effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Sundstrom, E., McIntyre, M., Halfhill, T., &amp; Richards, H. (2000) Work groups: From the Hawthorne studies to work teams of the 1990s and beyond. ''Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice, 4'', 44-67. doi:org/10.1037/1089-2699.4.1.44&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Job characteristic theory]] identifies core job dimensions that affect motivation, satisfaction, performance, etc. These dimensions include skill variety, task identity, task significance, autonomy and feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Hackman, J. R. &amp; Oldham, G. R. (1975). Development of job diagnostic survey. ''Journal of Applied Psychology, 60'', 159-170.&lt;/ref&gt; The dimensions map well to the team environment. Individual contributors who perform team tasks that are challenging, interesting, and engaging are more likely to be motivated to exert greater effort and perform better than team members who are working on tasks that lack those characteristics.&lt;ref name=jex/&gt;

====Organizational resources====
Organizational support systems affect the team effectiveness&lt;ref name = "Sun1990"/&gt; and provide resources for teams operating in the multi-team environment. During the chartering of new teams, organizational enabling resources are first identified. Examples of enabling resources include facilities, equipment, information, training, and leadership.&lt;ref name=jex/&gt; Team-specific resources (e.g., budgetary resources, human resources) are typically made available. Team-specific human resources represent the individual contributors who are selected to be  team members. Intra-team processes (e.g., task design, task assignment) involve these team-specific resources.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Teams also function in dynamic multi-team environments. Teams often must respond to shifting organizational contingencies.&lt;ref&gt;Salas, E., Stagl, K., &amp; Burke, C. (2004). 25 years of team effectiveness in organizations: Research themes and emerging needs, In C. Cooper &amp; I. Robertson (Eds.), ''International review of industrial and organizational psychology'', Vol. 19 (pp. 47–91). Chichester, UK: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; Contingencies affecting teams include constraints arising from conditions in which organizational resources are not exclusively earmarked for certain teams. When resources are scarce, they must be shared by multiple teams.

====Team rewards====
Organizational reward systems drive the strengthening and enhancing of individual team member efforts; such efforts contribute towards reaching team goals.&lt;ref&gt;Luthans, F., &amp; Kreitner, R. (1985). ''Organizational behavior modification and beyond: An operant and social learning approach'' (2nd ed.). Glenview, IL: Scott, Foresman&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, rewards that are given to individual team members should be contingent upon the performance of the entire team.&lt;ref name = "Sun1990"/&gt;

Several design elements are needed to enable organizational reward systems to operate successfully. First, for a collective assessment to be appropriate for individual team members, the group's tasks must be highly interdependent. If this is not the case, individual assessment is more appropriate than team assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Wageman, R., &amp; Baker, G. (1997). Incentives and cooperation: The joint effects of task and reward interdependence on group performance. ''Journal of Organizational Behavior, 18'', 139–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Second, individual-level reward systems and team-level reward systems must be compatible.&lt;ref&gt;Dematteo, J.S., Eby, L.T., &amp; Sundstrom, E. (1998). Team-based rewards: Current empirical evidence and directions for future research. ''Research in Organizational Behavior, 20'', 141–83.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it would be unfair to reward the entire team for a job well done if only one team member did most of the work. That team member would most likely view teams and teamwork negatively, and would not want to work on a team in the future. Third, an organizational culture must be created such that it supports and rewards employees who believe in the value of teamwork and who maintain a positive attitude towards team-based rewards.&lt;ref&gt;Haines, V.Y., &amp; Taggar, S. (2006). Antecedents of team reward attitude. ''Group Dynamics: Theory, Research, and Practice, 10'', 194–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Team goals====
Goals potentially motivate team members when goals contain three elements: difficulty, acceptance, and specificity.&lt;ref&gt;Lock, E.A., &amp; Latham, G.P. (1990). ''A theory of goal setting and task performance''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall&lt;/ref&gt; Under difficult goal conditions, teams with more committed members tend to outperform teams with less committed members.&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, K. (1994). Improving group task performance: The role of group goals and group efficacy. ''Human Performance, 7'', 55–78.&lt;/ref&gt; When team members commit to team goals, team effectiveness is a function of how supportive members are with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Aube, C., &amp; Rousseau, V. (2005). Team goal commitment and team effectiveness: The role of task interdependence and supportive behaviors.

===Job satisfaction and commitment===
{{main|Job satisfaction}}
Job satisfaction is often thought to reflect the extent to which a worker likes his or her job, or individual aspects or facets of jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Spector, P.E. (1997). ''Job satisfaction: Application, assessment, causes and consequences''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most heavily researched topics in I/O psychology. Job satisfaction has theoretical and practical utility for the field. It has been linked to important job outcomes including attitudinal variables (e.g., job involvement, organizational commitment), absenteeism, turnover intentions, actual turnover, job performance, and tension.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} A meta-analyses found job satisfaction to be related to life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and the absence of negative affect.&lt;ref&gt;Bowling, K., Eschleman, J., &amp;  Wang, Q (2010).

===Productive behavior===
Productive behavior is defined as employee behavior that contributes positively to the goals and objectives of an organization.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; When an employee begins a new job, there is a transition period during which he or she may not contribute significantly. To assist with this transition an employee typically requires job-related training. In financial terms, productive behavior represents the point at which an organization begins to achieve some return on the investment it has made in a new employee.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; I/O psychologists are ordinarily more focused on productive behavior than job or task performance, including in-role ''and'' extra-role performance. In-role performance tells managers how well an employee performs the required aspects of the job; extra-role performance includes behaviors not necessarily required by job but nonetheless contribute to organizational effectiveness. By taking both in-role and extra-role performance into account, an I/O psychologist is able to assess employees' effectiveness (how well they do what they were hired to do), efficiency (outputs to relative inputs), and productivity (how much they help the organization reach its goals). Three forms of productive behavior that I/O psychologists often evaluate include job performance, organizational citizenship behavior (see below), and innovation.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt;

====Job performance====
{{main|Job performance}}
[[Job performance]] represents behaviors employees engage in while at work which contribute to organizational goals.&lt;ref name="campbell1990"&gt;Campbell, J.P. (1990). Modeling the performance prediction problem in industrial and organizational psychology. In M.D. Dunnette &amp; L.M. Hough (Eds.), ''Handbook of industrial and organizational psychology'' (2nd ed., Vol 1, pp. 687–732). Palo Alto, CA: Consulting Psychologists Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors are formally evaluated by an organization as part of an employee's responsibilities.&lt;ref name="campbell1990"/&gt; In order to understand and ultimately predict job performance, it is important to be precise when defining the term. Job performance is about behaviors that are within the control of the employee and not about results (effectiveness), the costs involved in achieving results (productivity), the results that can be achieved in a period of time (efficiency), or the value an organization places on a given level of performance, effectiveness, productivity or efficiency (utility).&lt;ref name=jex /&gt;

To model job performance, researchers have attempted to define a set of dimensions that are common to all jobs. Using a common set of dimensions provides a consistent basis for assessing performance and enables the comparison of performance across jobs. Performance is commonly broken into two major categories: in-role (technical aspects of a job) and extra-role (non-technical abilities such as communication skills and being a good team member). While this distinction in behavior has been challenged&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, E.W. (1994). Role definitions and organizational citizenship behavior: The importance of the employee's perspective. ''Academy of Management Journal'', 37, 1543–67.&lt;/ref&gt; it is commonly made by both employees and management.&lt;ref name="VanDyneLePine1998"&gt;Van Dyne &amp; LePine (1998). Helping and Voice Extra-role Behaviors: Evidence of Construct and Predictive Validity, ''The Academy of Management Journal'', Vol. 41, No. 1 (Feb. 1998, pp. 108–19).&lt;/ref&gt; A model of performance by Campbell breaks performance into in-role and extra-role categories.&lt;ref name="campbell1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell1994"&gt;Campbell, J.P. (1994). Alternative models of job performance and their implications for selection and classification. In M.G. Rumsey; C.B. Walker &amp; J.H. Harris (Eds.), ''Personnel selection and classification'' (pp. 33–51). Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell labeled job-specific task proficiency and non-job-specific task proficiency as in-role dimensions, while written and oral communication, demonstrating effort, maintaining personal discipline, facilitating peer and team performance, supervision and leadership and management and administration are labeled as extra-role dimensions.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; Murphy's model of job performance also broke job performance into in-role and extra-role categories.&lt;ref name="Murphy1994"&gt;Murphy, K.R. (1994). Toward a broad conceptualization of jobs and job performance: Impact of changes in the military environment on the structure, assessment, and prediction of job performance. In M.G. Rumsey; C.B. Walker &amp; J.H. Harris (Eds.), ''Personnel selection and classification'' (pp. 85–102), Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; However, task-orientated behaviors composed the in-role category and the extra-role category included interpersonally-oriented behaviors, down-time behaviors and destructive and hazardous behaviors.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; However, it has been challenged as to whether the measurement of job performance is usually done through pencil/paper tests, job skills tests, on-site hands-on tests, off-site hands-on tests, high-fidelity simulations, symbolic simulations, task ratings and global ratings.&lt;ref name=Murphy1989&gt;Murphy, K.R. (1989).  Dimensions of job performance. In R. Dillon &amp; J.W. Pelligrino (Eds.), ''Testing: Theoretical and applied perspectives'' (pp. 218–47). New York: Praeger&lt;/ref&gt; These various tools are often used to evaluate performance on specific tasks and overall job performance.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; Van Dyne and LePine developed a measurement model in which overall job performance was evaluated using Campbell's in-role and extra-role categories.&lt;ref name="VanDyneLePine1998"/&gt; Here, in-role performance was reflected through how well "employees met their performance expectations and performed well at the tasks that made up the employees' job."&lt;ref name="jex2008104"&gt;Jex, S.M. &amp; Britt, T.W. (2008). Organizational Psychology. Hoboken, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Dimensions regarding how well the employee assists others with their work for the benefit of the group, if the employee voices new ideas for projects or changes to procedure and whether the employee attends functions that help the group composed the extra-role category.

To assess job performance, reliable and valid measures must be established. While there are many sources of error with [[Performance Rating (Work Measurement)|performance ratings]], error can be reduced through rater training&lt;ref name= "Pulakos1984"&gt;Pulakos, E.D. (1984). A comparison of rater training programs: Error training and accuracy training. ''Journal of Applied Psychology'', 69, 581–88)&lt;/ref&gt; and through the use of behaviorally-anchored rating scales. Such scales can be used to clearly define the behaviors that constitute poor, average, and superior performance.&lt;ref name="campbell1990"/&gt; Additional factors that complicate the measurement of job performance include the instability of job performance over time due to forces such as changing performance criteria, the structure of the job itself&lt;ref name="Murphy1994"/&gt; and the restriction of variation in individual performance by organizational forces. These factors include errors in job measurement techniques, acceptance and the justification of poor performance and lack of importance of individual performance.

The determinants of job performance consist of factors having to do with the individual worker as well as environmental factors in the workplace. According to Campbell's Model of The Determinants of Job Performance,&lt;ref name="campbell1990"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell1994"/&gt; job performance is a result of the interaction between declarative knowledge (knowledge of facts or things), procedural knowledge (knowledge of what needs to be done and how to do it), and motivation (reflective of an employee's choices regarding whether to expend effort, the level of effort to expend, and whether to persist with the level of effort chosen).&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; The interplay between these factors show that an employee may, for example, have a low level of declarative knowledge, but may still have a high level of performance if the employee has high levels of procedural knowledge and motivation.

Regardless of the job, three determinants stand out as predictors of performance: (1) general mental ability (especially for jobs higher in complexity); (2) job experience (although there is a law of diminishing returns); and (3) the personality trait of conscientiousness (people who are dependable and achievement-oriented, who plan well).&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; These determinants appear to influence performance largely through the acquisition and usage of job knowledge and the motivation to do well. Further, an expanding area of research in job performance determinants includes emotional intelligence.&lt;ref name= "Baron"&gt;Baron, R.; Handley R. &amp; Fund S. (2006). The impact of emotional intelligence on performance. In V.U. Druskat; F. Sala &amp; G. Mount (Eds.), ''Linking emotional intelligence and performance at work: Current research evidence with individuals and groups'' (pp. 3–19). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goleman"&gt;Goleman, D. (1998). ''Working with Emotional Intelligence''. New York: Bantam Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organizational citizenship behavior===
{{main|Organizational citizenship behavior}}
Organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) are another form of workplace behavior that I/O psychologists are involved with. OCBs tend to be beneficial to both the organization and other workers. Dennis Organ (1988) defines OCBs as "individual behavior that is discretionary, not directly or explicitly recognized by the formal reward system, and that in the aggregate promotes the effective functioning of the organization."&lt;ref name="Organ1988"&gt;Organ, D.W. (1988). ''Organizational citizenship behavior: The good soldier syndrome''. Lexington, MA England: Lexington Books/D.C. Heath and Com.&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviors that qualify as OCBs can fall into one of the following five categories: altruism, courtesy, sportsmanship, conscientiousness, and civic virtue.&lt;ref name="Organ1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Organ1977"&gt;Organ, D.W. (1977). Inferences about trends in labor force satisfaction: A causal-correlational analysis. ''Academy of Management Journal'', 20(4), 510–19. {{doi|10.2307/255353}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Organ1994"&gt;Organ, D.W. (1994). Organizational citizenship behavior and the good soldier. In M.G. Rumsey; C.B. Walker; J. Harris (Eds.), ''Personnel selection and classification'' (pp. 53–67). Hillsdale, NJ England: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; OCBs have also been categorized in other ways too, for example, by their intended targets (individuals, supervisors, and the organization as a whole.&lt;ref name="WilliamsAnderson"&gt;Williams, L.J. &amp; Anderson, S.E. (1994). Job satisfaction and organizational commitment as predictors of organizational citizenship and in-role behavior. ''Journal of Management, 17'', 601–17&lt;/ref&gt; Other alternative ways of categorizing OCBs include "compulsory OCBs," which are engaged in owing to coercive persuasion or peer pressure rather than out of good will.&lt;ref name="Vigoda2006"&gt;Vigoda-Gadot, E. (2006). Compulsory citizenship behavior: Theorizing some dark sides of the Good Soldier Syndrome in organizations. ''Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour, 36'', 77–93. {{doi|10.1111/j.1468-5914.2006.00297}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which OCBs are voluntary has been the subject of some debate.&lt;ref name="Vigoda2006"/&gt;

Other research suggests that some employees perform OCBs to influence how they are viewed within the organization. While these behaviors are not formally part of the job description, performing them can influence performance appraisals.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; Researchers have advanced the view that employees engage in OCBs as a form of "impression management," a term coined by [[Erving Goffman]].&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, E. (1959). ''The presentation of self in everyday life''. New York: Anchor Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Goffman defined impression management as "the way in which the individual ... presents himself and his activity to others, the ways in which he guides and controls the impression they form of him, and the kinds of things he may and may not do while sustaining his performance before them. Some researchers have hypothesized that OCBs are not performed out of good will, positive affect, etc., but instead as a way of being noticed by others, including supervisors.&lt;ref name="Bolino"&gt;Bolino, M.C. (1999). Citizenship and impression management: Good soldiers or good actors? Academy of Management Review, 24(1), 82–98. {{doi|10.2307/259038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innovation===
{{main|Innovation}}
Industrial and organizational psychologists consider [[innovation]], more often than not, a variable of less importance and often a counter-productive one to include in conducting job performance appraisals when irrelevant to the major job functions for which a given job exists. Nonetheless, I/O psychologists see the value of that variable where its consideration would, were its reliability and validity questioned, achieve a statistically significant probability that its results are not due to chance, and that it can be replicated reliably with a statistically significant ratio of reliability, and that were a court to raise a question on its reliability and validity testing, the I/O psychologist behind its use would be able to defend it before a court of justice with the belief that it will stand before such a court as reliable, and valid{{clarify|pre-text=remove or|date=February 2018}}{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}.

Four qualities are generally linked to creative and innovative behaviour by individuals:&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; 
* Task-relevant skills (general mental ability and job specific knowledge). Task specific and subject specific knowledge is most often gained through higher education; however, it may also be gained by mentoring and experience in a given field.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt;
* Creativity-relevant skills (ability to concentrate on a problem for long periods of time, to abandon unproductive searches, and to temporarily put aside stubborn problems). The ability to put aside stubborn problems is referred to by Jex &amp; Britt as productive forgetting.&lt;ref name=jex /&gt; Creativity-relevant skills also require the individual contributor to evaluate a problem from multiple vantage points. One must be able to take on the perspective of various users. For example, an Operation Manager analyzing a reporting issue and developing an innovative solution would consider the perspective of a sales person, assistant, finance, compensation, and compliance officer.
* Task motivation (internal desire to perform task and level of enjoyment).&lt;ref name=jex /&gt;

At the organizational level, a study by Damanpour identified four specific characteristics that may predict innovation:&lt;ref&gt;Damanpour, F. (1991). Organizational innovation: A meta-analysis of effects of determinants and moderators. ''Academy of Management Journal'', 34, 555–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counterproductive work behavior===
{{main|Counterproductive work behavior}}
Counterproductive work behavior (CWB) can be defined as employee behavior that goes against the goals of an organization. These behaviors can be intentional or unintentional and result from a wide range of underlying causes and motivations. Some CWBs have instrumental motivations (e.g., theft).&lt;ref name = "Spector and Fox"/&gt; It has been proposed that a person-by-environment interaction can be utilized to explain a variety of counterproductive behaviors (Fox and Spector, 1999). For instance, an employee who sabotages another employee's work may do so because of lax supervision (environment) and underlying psychopathology (person) that work in concert to result in the counterproductive behavior. There is evidence that an emotional response (e.g., anger) to job stress (e.g., unfair treatment) can motivate CWBs.&lt;ref name = "Spector and Fox"/&gt;

The forms of counterproductive behavior with the most empirical examination are ineffective [[job performance]], [[absenteeism]], [[job turnover]], and [[accident]]s. Less common but potentially more detrimental forms of counterproductive behavior have also been investigated including violence and [[sexual harassment]].

===Leadership===
{{main|Leadership}}
In I/O psychology, leadership can be defined as a process of influencing others to agree on a shared purpose, and to work towards shared objectives.&lt;ref&gt;Yukl, G. (2010). Leadership in organizations (7th Ed.). New Jersey: Pearson&lt;/ref&gt; A distinction should be made between leadership and [[management]]. Managers process administrative tasks and organize work environments. Although leaders may be required to undertake managerial duties as well, leaders typically focus on inspiring followers and creating a shared organizational culture and values. Managers deal with complexity, while leaders deal with initiating and adapting to change. Managers undertake the tasks of planning, budgeting, organizing, staffing, controlling and problem solving. In contrast, leaders undertake the tasks of setting a direction or vision, aligning people to shared goals, communicating, and motivating.&lt;ref&gt;Daft, R.L. (2011). ''Leadership'' (5th Ed.). Australia: Cengage.&lt;/ref&gt;

Approaches to studying leadership in I/O psychology can be broadly classified into three categories: Leader-focused approaches, contingency-focused approaches, and follower-focused approaches.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

====Leader-focused approaches====
Leader-focused approaches look to organizational leaders to determine the characteristics of effective [[leadership]]. According to the [[Trait theory|trait approach]], more effective leaders possess certain traits that less effective leaders lack. More recently, this approach is being used to predict leader emergence. The following traits have been identified as those that predict leader emergence when there is no formal leader: high intelligence, high needs for dominance, high self-motivation, and socially perceptive.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, R.L.; Ginnett, R.C. &amp; Curphy, G.J. (2009). ''Leadership: Enhancing the lessons of experience'' (6th Ed.). Boston: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Another leader-focused approached is the '''behavioral approach''' which focuses on the behaviors that distinguish effective from ineffective leaders. There are two categories of leadership behaviors: (1) [[Consideration and Initiating Structure|consideration]]; and (2) [[Consideration and Initiating Structure|initiating structure]]. Behaviors associated with the category of consideration include showing subordinates they are valued and that the leader cares about them. An example of a consideration behavior is showing compassion when problems arise in or out of the office. Behaviors associated with the category of initiating structure include facilitating the task performance of groups. One example of an initiating structure behavior is meeting one-on-one with subordinates to explain expectations and goals. The final leader-focused approach is '''[[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[social influence|influence]]'''. To be most effective a leader should be able to influence others to behave in ways that are in line with the organization's mission and goals. How influential a leader can be depends on their social power or their potential to influence their subordinates. There are six bases of power: [[French &amp; Raven's Five bases of Power|coercive power, reward power, legitimate power, expert power, referent power]], and informational power. A leader can use several different tactics to influence others within an organization. These common tactics include: rational [[persuasion]], inspirational appeal, consultation, [[ingratiation]], exchange, personal appeal, coalition, legitimating, and pressure.&lt;ref name="Jex, S. M. 2008"&gt;Jex, S.M. &amp; Britt, T.W. (2008). ''Organizational Psychology: A scientist-practitioner approach'' (2nd Ed.). New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Contingency-focused approaches====
Of the 3 approaches to leadership, contingency-focused approaches have been the most prevalent over the past 30 years. Contingency-focused theories base a leader's effectiveness on their ability to assess a situation and adapt their behavior accordingly.&lt;ref name="Jex, S. M. 2008"/&gt; These theories assume that an effective leader can accurately "read" a situation and skillfully employ a leadership style that meets the needs of the individuals involved and the task at hand. A brief introduction to the most prominent contingency-focused theories will follow.

[[Fiedler contingency model|Fiedler's Contingency Theory]] holds that a leader's effectiveness depends on the interaction between their characteristics and the characteristics of the situation. [[Path–Goal Theory]] asserts that the role of the leader is to help his or her subordinates achieve their goals. To effectively do this, leaders must skillfully select from four different leadership styles to meet the situational factors. The situational factors are a product of the characteristics of subordinates and the characteristics of the environment. The [[Leader-Member Exchange Theory (LMX)|Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) Model]] focuses on how leader–subordinate relationships develop. Generally speaking, when a subordinate performs well or when there are positive exchanges between a leader and a subordinate, their relationship is strengthened, performance and job satisfaction are enhanced, and the subordinate will feel more commitment to the leader and the organization as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goleman |first= Daniel |title=Primal Leadership |year=2002 |publisher=Harvard Business School Press |location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vroom-Yetton decision model|Vroom-Yetton-Jago Model]] focuses on decision making with respect to a ''feasibility set''&lt;ref name="Jex, S. M. 2008"/&gt; which is composed of the situational attributes.

In addition to the contingency-focused approaches mentioned, there has been a high degree of interest paid to three novel approaches that have recently emerged. The first is [[transformational leadership]], which posits that there are certain leadership traits that inspire subordinates to perform beyond their capabilities. The second is [[transactional leadership]], which is most concerned with keeping subordinates in-line with deadlines and organizational policy. This type of leader fills more of a managerial role and lacks qualities necessary to inspire subordinates and induce meaningful change. And the third is authentic leadership which is centered around empathy and a leader's values or character. If the leader understands their followers, they can inspire subordinates by cultivating a personal connection and leading them to share in the vision and goals of the team. Although there has been a limited amount of research conducted on these theories, they are sure to receive continued attention as the field of I/O psychology matures.

====Follower-focused approaches====
Follower-focused approaches look at the processes by which leaders motivate followers, and lead teams to achieve shared goals. Understandably, the area of leadership motivation draws heavily from the abundant research literature in the domain of [[motivation]] in I/O psychology. Because leaders are held responsible for their followers' ability to achieve the organization's goals, their ability to motivate their followers is a critical factor of leadership effectiveness. Similarly, the area of team leadership draws heavily from the research in [[team]]s and team effectiveness in I/O psychology. Because organizational employees are frequently structured in the form of teams, leaders need to be aware of the potential benefits and pitfalls of working in teams, how teams develop, how to satisfy team members' needs, and ultimately how to bring about team effectiveness and performance.

An emerging area of I/O research in the area of team leadership is in leading [[virtual team]]s, where people in the team are geographically-distributed across various distances and sometimes even countries. While technological advances have enabled the leadership process to take place in such virtual contexts, they present new challenges for leaders as well, such as the need to use technology to build relationships with followers, and influencing followers when faced with limited (or no) face-to-face interaction.

====Organizational development====
{{Main|Organization development}}
I/O psychologists are also concerned with organizational change. This effort, called organizational development (OD). Tools used to advance organization development include the survey feedback technique. The technique involves the periodic assessment (with surveys) of employee attitudes and feelings. The results are conveyed to organizational stakeholders, who may want to take the organization in a particular direction. Another tool is the team building technique. Because many if not most  tasks within the organization are completed by small groups and/or teams, team building is important to organizational success. In order to enhance a team's morale and problem-solving skills, I/O psychologists help the groups to build their self-confidence, group cohesiveness, and working effectiveness.&lt;ref name=schultz&gt;

===Relation to organizational behavior===

The I/O psychology and [[organizational behavior]] have manifested some overlap.&lt;ref&gt;Miner, J.(2006) ''Organizational behavior 3: Historical origins, theoretical foundations and the future''. Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; The overlap has led to some confusion regarding how the two disciplines differ.&lt;ref&gt;Jex, S.M., &amp; Britt, T.W. (2008). ''Organizational psychology: A scientist-practitioner approach'' (2nd ed.). Hoboken, NJ: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also much confusion about the differences between I/O psychology and [[human resources]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.findmypathway.com/blog/human-resources-vs-organisational-psychology/|title=Human Resources vs Organisational Psychology - Find My Pathway|date=2018-10-21|work=Find My Pathway|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or [[human resource management]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guest|first=David E.|date=1994|title=Organizational psychology and human resource management: Towards a european approach|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13594329408410488?journalCode=pewo19|journal=European Work and Organizational Psychologist|language=en|volume=4|issue=3|pages=251–270|doi=10.1080/13594329408410488|issn=0960-2003|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==

The minimum requirement for working as an I/O psychologist is a master's degree. Normally, this degree requires about 2–3 years to complete. Of all the degrees granted in I/O psychology each year, approximately two thirds are at the master's level.&lt;ref name=schultz /&gt;{{rp|page=18}}
 
A comprehensive list of US and Canadian master's and doctoral programs can be found at the web site of the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP).&lt;ref name="siop.org"&gt;[http://www.siop.org/gtp/gtplookup.asp Graduate Training Programs (visited web site on March 22, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; Admission into I/O psychology PhD programs is highly competitive given that many programs accept a small number of applicants every year.
 
There are graduate degree programs in I/O psychology outside of the US and Canada. The SIOP web site&lt;ref name="siop.org"/&gt; also provides a comprehensive list of I/O programs in many other countries.

In Australia, Organizational Psychologists must be accredited by the [[Australian Psychological Society|Australia Psychological Society]] (APS). To become an Organizational Psychologist, one must meet the criteria for a general psychologist's licence: 3 years studying bachelor's degree in Psychology, 4th year Honours degree or Postgraduate Diploma in Psychology, and two-year full-time supervised practice plus 80 hours of professional development. There are other avenues available, such as a two year supervised training program after Honours (i.e. 4+2 pathway), or one year of postgraduate coursework and practical placements followed by a one year supervised training program (i.e. 5+1 pathway)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.findmypathway.com/psychology/psychology-internships/|title=Psychology Internship Pathways - Find My Pathway|work=Find My Pathway|access-date=2018-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologyboard.gov.au/Registration/Provisional.aspx|title=Psychology Board of Australia - Provisional registration|website=www.psychologyboard.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. After this, psychologists can elect to specialize as Organizational Psychologists.

===Competencies===

There are many different sets of competencies for different specializations within I/O psychology and I/O psychologists are versatile behavioral scientists. For example, an I/O psychologist specializing in selection and recruiting should have expertise in finding the best talent for the organization and getting everyone on board while he or she might not need to know much about executive coaching. Some I/O psychologists specialize in specific areas of consulting whereas others tend to generalize their areas of expertise. There are basic skills and knowledge an individual needs in order to be an effective I/O psychologist, which include being an independent learner, [[interpersonal skills]] (e.g., listening skills), and general consultation skills (e.g., skills and knowledge in the problem area).&lt;ref&gt;Cummings, T.G., &amp; Worley, C.G. (2015). ''Organization development and change''. Boston: Cengage.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Job outlook===

According to the United States Department of Labor's [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]], I/O psychology is the fastest growing occupation in the United States, based on projections between 2012 and 2022.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com.au/fastest-growing-jobs-2013-12?op=1#1-industrial-organizational-psychologists-30&lt;/ref&gt; 
In a 2006 salary survey,&lt;ref&gt;Khanna, C., &amp; Medsker, G. J. (2007). 2006 Income and employment survey results for the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology. Bowling Green, OH: Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt; the median salary for a PhD in I/O psychology was $98,000; for a master's level I/O psychologist was $72,000. The highest paid PhD I/O psychologists in private industry worked in pharmaceuticals and averaged approximately $151,000 per year; the median salary for self-employed consultants was $150,000; those employed in retail, energy, and manufacturing followed closely behind, averaging approximately $133,000. The lowest earners were found in state and local government positions, averaging approximately $77,000.

== Ethics ==
An I/O psychologist, whether an academic, a consultant, or an employee, must maintain high ethical standards.&lt;ref&gt;Biech, E. (Ed.) (2007). The ethics of the business. ''The business of consulting: The basics and beyond'' (pp. 231–244). San Francisco, CA: Pfeiffer.&lt;/ref&gt; The APA's ethical principles apply to I/O psychologists. For example, ethically, the I/O psychologist should only accept projects for which he or she is qualified. With more organizations becoming global, it is important that when an I/O psychologist works outside her or his home country, the psychologist is aware of rules, regulations, and cultures of the organizations and countries in which the psychologist works, while adhering to the ethical standards set at home.&lt;ref&gt;Mobley, W. H. (2008). Rules of thumb for international consultants. In J. W. Hedge, &amp; W. C. Borman (Eds.), ''The I/O consultant: Advice and insights for building a successful career'' (pp. 309–314).

Mixing and matching is the unavoidable process in the making of inner connections and the presentations of interculturalities. The majority of the works in intercultural theatre deal basically with thinking and doing around the themes, stories, pre-performative or performative concepts of Asian classical theatre or traditional performing arts forms and practices, mixing and matching the concepts or the ideas of the foreign.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0415092167 "Theatre world performance politics culture"]&lt;/ref&gt; After the well-known success of Peter Brook's production of the Mahabharata,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smith.edu/metamorphoses/issues/links/hellwegpeter.html "Metamorphoses"]&lt;/ref&gt; the trend has been evolving tremendously around the globe and many the cultural institutions of many governments have become directly interested in pushing the boundaries of intercultural senses and sensitivities by financially investing on new theatrical productions, university research, conferences and fellowships&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuigalway.ie/about-us/news-and-events/news-archive "SUSI Grants"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The three major groups of intercultural theatre ==

===Imitational theatre===
The intended audience is from the same culture, or a foreign audience from a different culture and the theater group, or the actors or performers, come from the same cultural background or from very diverse foreign cultural backgrounds. The production may imitate foreign styles, the production procedures may introduce new techniques, a new style of acting or a new style of presentation for a group of actors from various cultures or the same culture, the production may include foreign languages, costumes, scenic themes and other aspects. There are many examples of intercultural theatre groups, people, and institutions who are experimenting with various levels of mixing and matching of traditional or contemporary aspects of theatre training and presentations in this type of Imitational Theatre. 

After the global acceptance of renowned theatre director Peter Brook, many theatre directors went after Asian traditional theatre art forms and other Asian representational systems, in order to develop and portray their own theatre presentations using, or somehow capitalizing on the actor training systems and scenic representations belonging to those particular Asian theatres, such as the Noh theatre, Kathakali, Chinese opera etcetera. While Peter Brook was successful in his approach to a universally accepted vision of theatre-making through the Asian theatre systems --beyond the parameters of imitating different theatrical topics-- many other younger institutions or directorial approaches are kept within the parameters of imitations or comparisons, or only exchanges of physical exercises.

===Adaptive theatre===
There are two types of intercultural theatre within adapted theatre. One can consider "the norm" to represent what the audience of a certain culture expects/has typically been exposed to:

* '''Adapts to the norm''' - traditional style productions that have been consciously adapted to fit with the cultural expectations of the intended audience of another culture.
* '''Adapts away from the norm''' - the original culture dominates but it borrows foreign elements to enlarge the range of expression (e.g. [[TheatreWorks (Singapore)]] and [[Ong Keng Sen]]; [[International Centre for Theatre Research]] and [[Peter Brook]]; and [[The Bridge - Stage of the Arts#Betty Comden's article about the festival|The Bridge - Stage of the Arts]])

===Universal theatre===
The aim of universal theatre is to be recognized and accepted by audience members from a wide range of cultural backgrounds (e.g. [[Peter Brook#The Mahabharata|The Mahabharata, Peter Brook]], [http://www.performingarts.jp/e/data_art/other/p-10481.html Hiroshi Koike] [http://kikh.com/ Bridge Project- The Mahabharata],&lt;ref&gt;[http://pappa-tara.com "Performing Arts Institute"]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://barihochwald.com/ Bari Hochwald] [http://theglobaltheatreproject.org/ The Global Theatre Project],&lt;ref&gt;[http://theglobaltheatreproject.org "The Global Theatre Project"]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.tfana.org/education/programs/world-theatre The World Theatre Project], [http://www.peoplestheatreproject.org/ People's Theatre Project] etc.)

==The sub-divisions of intercultural theatre==
Globalization supported in the developments of intercultural theatre in various directions and evolutions of point of views by the theatre practitioners, scholars, funders and producers(British Council, Fulbright, Ford foundation, [http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/Rockefeller-Foundation-Awards-1128 The Rockefeller foundation]) particularly using English language as the main medium of communication for knowing, acknowledging, debating, reasoning, considering, teaching, learning, writing, speaking, adapting, translating or transforming the one culture to the other culture in large contexts and in detailed micro contexts. Primarily the discourses of intercultural theatre practice developed out of the re-source influences of western theatre arts, western theoreticians and western theatre practitioners. (e.g. [http://www.odinteatret.dk/about-us/eugenio-barba.aspx%20 Eugenio Barba], [[Jerzy Grotowski]], [http://www.theworkcenter.org/ Thomas Richards], [[Peter Brook]], [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]],[http://www.phillipzarrilli.com/ Phillip Zarilli])

===American intercultural theatre===
*For many theatre cultures, American intercultural theatre has given the possibilities of new exchanges, experiments, researches and pioneer introductions of model attempts in theatre making. There are many directors, teachers or theatre artists began working with the sources of American point of views in the intercultural attempts and some of them are [http://rasaboxes.org/about/eca-biographies/ Richard Schechner], [http://www.phillipzarrilli.com/ Phillip Zarilli], Robert Wilson,Christian DuComb Phd, Prof.Esther Kim Lee, Ellen Stewart-La MaMa, Lee Breuer-Mabou Mines, Hugh Gittens, Anne Bogart, Phillip Glass etc.

===Australian intercultural theatre===

===British intercultural theatre===

===Canadian intercultural theatre===

==Non-Native English language speaking countries intercultural theatre==
*English is the primary medium of communication in the intercultural theatre scene worldwide and American English or British English used as the mother source language to make all transactions related with theatre training, teaching and performing. Many non English countries have welcomed the English language as the official medium for the citizens and thus opened possibilities of any business. The culture is also part of business in the sense of in-coming and out-going, travelling or transforming stories, experiences, music, histories and philosophies. The dramatic theories and the acting coaching is mainly developed by the American or European masters of contemporary theatre. The non native English language speaking cultures supported the new experiences, exchanges, experiments to present the new shows.

[[Image:Wildsau mit Frischling.jpg|thumb|220px|Young [[wild boar]] [[suckling]] from adult female. Here, juvenile colouring acts as a form of [[camouflage]]]]
[[File:Pinus pinea foliage.jpg|thumb|Juvenile (left) and adult (right) leaves of [[Stone Pine]]]]

A '''juvenile''' is an individual [[organism]] that has not yet reached its [[adult]] form, [[sexual maturity]] or size. Juveniles sometimes look very different from the adult form, particularly in colour. In many organisms the juvenile has a different name from the adult (see also [[List of animal names]]).

Some organisms reach sexual maturity in a short [[metamorphosis]], such as [[eclosion]] in many [[insect]]s. For others, the transition from juvenile to fully mature is a more prolonged process—[[puberty]] for example. In such cases, juveniles during this transformation are sometimes called '''subadults'''.

Many [[invertebrate]]s, on reaching the adult stage, are fully mature and their development and growth stops. Their juveniles are [[larva]]e or [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]].

In [[vertebrate]]s and some invertebrates (e.g. [[spider]]s), larval forms (e.g. [[tadpole]]s) are usually considered a development stage of their own, and "juvenile" refers to a post-larval stage that is not fully grown and not sexually mature. In [[amniote]]s and most [[plant]]s, the [[embryo]] represents the larval stage. Here, a "juvenile" is an individual in the time between hatching/birth/germination and reaching maturity.

A '''litter''' is the live birth of multiple [[offspring]] at one time in [[animal]]s from the same mother and usually from one set of [[parent]]s, particularly from three to eight offspring. The word is most often used for the offspring of [[mammal]]s, but can be used for any animal that gives birth to multiple young.  In comparison, a group of [[egg (biology)|eggs]] and the offspring that hatch from them are frequently called a [[clutch (animal)|clutch]], while young birds are often called a [[offspring|brood]]. Animals from the same litter are referred to as litter-mates.

Animals frequently display grouping behavior in [[herd]]s, [[swarm]]s, [[Flock (birds)|flocks]], or [[Colony (biology)|colonies]], and these multiple births derive similar advantages.  A litter offers some protection from [[predation]], not particularly to the individual young but to the parents' investment in breeding.  With multiple young, predators could eat several and others could still survive to reach maturity, but with only one offspring, its loss could mean a wasted breeding season.  The other significant advantage is the chance for the healthiest young animals to be favored from a group.  Rather than it being a conscious decision on the part of the parents, the fittest and strongest baby competes most successfully for food and space, leaving the weakest young, or [[runt]]s, to die through lack of care.

In the wild, only a small percentage, if any, of the litter may survive to maturity, whereas for domesticated animals and those in captivity with human care the whole litter almost always survives. [[Kittens]] and [[puppies]] are in this group. [[Carnivore]]s, [[rodent]]s, and [[pig]]s usually have litters, while primates and larger herbivores usually have singletons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12610">The '''Mesoamerican Biological Corridor''' (MBC) is a region that consists of Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, and some southern states of Mexico. The area acts as a natural [[land bridge]] from [[South America]] to [[North America]], which is important for species who use the bridge in [[Animal migration|migration]]. Due to the extensive unique habitat types, Mesoamerica contains somewhere between 7 and 10% of the world’s known species.&lt;ref name=Grandia /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ray&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ray|first1=Deepak|title=Dry season clouds and rainfall in northern Central America: Implications for the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor|journal=Global and Planetary Change|date=26 September 2005|volume=54|issue=1–2|pages=150–162|doi=10.1016/j.gloplacha.2005.09.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921818106001159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tbpa&gt;{{cite web|title=Mesoamerican Biological Corridor: Mexico to Panama|url=http://www.tbpa.net/docs/62_Meso_American_Biological_Corridor.pdf|website=Global Transboundary Conservation Network|publisher=Global Transboundary Conservation Network|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The corridor was originally proposed in the 1990s to facilitate animal movements along the Americas without interfering with human development and land use, while promoting [[Sustainability|ecological sustainability]].&lt;ref name=Ray /&gt; The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor is made of four parts: Core Zones, Buffer Zones, Corridor Zones, and Multiple-Use Zones,&lt;ref name=Ray /&gt; each with varying availability for human use.

== Background ==
With the increasing conversion of natural tropical ecosystems to agricultural farms and for other human use, comes growing concern over conservation of local species.&lt;ref name=Harvey&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvey|first1=Celia|title=Integrating Agricultural Landscapes with Biodiversity Conservation in the Mesoamerican Hotspot|journal=Conservation Biology|date=1 Feb 2008|volume=22|issue=1|pages=8–15|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2007.00863.x|pmid=18254848}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mesoamerica is considered one of many biodiversity hotspots where extinction is a significant threat.&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myers|first1=Norman|title=Biodiversity hotspots for conservation priorities|journal=Nature|date=24 Feb 2000|volume=403|pages=853–858|doi=10.1038/35002501|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v403/n6772/pdf/403853a0.pdf|accessdate=6 October 2014|pmid=10706275|issue=6772}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area is the world’s third largest biodiversity hotspot.&lt;ref name=Grandia&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grandia|first1=Liza|title=Between Bolivar and Bureaucracy: The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor|journal=Conservation &amp; Society|date=26 Jun 2009|volume=5|issue=4|pages=478–503|url=http://conservationandsociety.org/article.asp?issn=0972-4923;year=2007;volume=5;issue=4;spage=478;epage=503;aulast=Grandia|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some efforts have been made to protect organisms in the region, however, many of these protected sites are “small, fragmented, isolated, or poorly protected”&lt;ref name=Harvey /&gt;

In the late 1980s, Archie Carr III envisioned a way to protect threatened and endangered wildlife native to the region by connecting fragmented patches of habitat, and to create buffer zones to allow different levels of land use near protected areas.&lt;ref name=IEG&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Independent Evaluation Group|title=The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor|journal=Regional Program Review|date=2011|volume=5|issue=2|url=http://ieg.worldbankgroup.org/Data/reports/mbc_rpr.pdf|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corridor that eventually came to be, originally called Paseo Pantera (Spanish for Path of the Panther), follows the Atlantic coastline. [[File:CAmerica.gif|thumb|A topographical map of the region encompassing the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor, along the Atlantic coast, and Central American mountain ranges, along the Pacific coast.]] The MBC began in the late 1990s, by funding from the World Bank in order to promote wildlife conservation, particularly endemic, threatened, and endangered species, and ways to use the land in a sustainable fashion.&lt;ref name=Grandia /&gt; It was developed by a team of biologists from the University of Florida and the Central American Commission on Environment and Development (CCAD), and was remapped by CCAD, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) for political reason.&lt;ref name=IEG /&gt; $4 million was invested in the corridor by United States Agency for International Development (USAID) from 1990 to 1995.&lt;ref name=IEG /&gt; In 1992, all of the countries that are part of the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor joined the Central American System of Protected Areas (SICAP), which allows each country to “maintain its own ministries of the environment.” &lt;ref name=declerk&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DeClerck|first1=Fabrice A.J.|last2=Chazdon|first2=Robin|last3=Holl|first3=Karen D.|last4=Milder|first4=Jeffrey C.|last5=Finegan|first5=Bryan|last6=Martinez-Salinas|first6=Alejandra|last7=Imbach|first7=Pablo|last8=Canet|first8=Lindsay|last9=Ramos|first9=Zayra|title=Biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes of Mesoamerica: Past, present and future|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=143|issue=10|pages=2301–2313|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2010.03.026|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The corridor project has been successful in providing wildlife habitat; however, regional biota remained threatened due to fragmented areas and “unevenness of the region’s protected area system”&lt;ref name=IEG /&gt;

== Ecosystems ==

The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor incorporates multiple diverse biomes and is bordered by the Caribbean Sea to the east and the Pacific Ocean on the west. Splitting the corridor in half is the Guatemalan Mountain range, which includes active volcanoes. These environmental forces create four terrestrial biomes and 19 terrestrial ecoregions. The biomes include, tropical dry broadleaf forest, tropical wet broadleaf forests, xeric shrub lands, and tropical coniferous forests.&lt;ref name=declerk /&gt;

== Land use ==
According to data from 2003, roughly 57% of the Mesoamerican biological corridor is natural vegetation, with the remaining land being used mostly for cattle and crop production. The main crops produced in the MBC include sugar cane, corn, coffee, and beans. With agricultural production being such a large part of all the nations economies, there is much emphasis on adopting sustainable agricultural practices.&lt;ref name=declerk /&gt;

The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor is made of four parts: Core Zones, Buffer Zones, Corridor Zones, and Multiple-Use Zones, each with varying availability for human use. Core Zones are protected areas whose purpose is to promote and sustain biodiversity in the areas in order to maintain ecosystem services to the local people. Buffer Zones include the areas surrounding the protected Core Zones, which are made up mostly of wild land. Pathways between zones are labeled as Corridor (or Connectivity) Zones; these zones link water and land passages, allowing movement of plants and animals throughout the corridor. Finally Multi-use Zones, separate wild and protected land from land used for forestry, agriculture, and areas of direct human impacts.&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Kenton Miller, Elsa Chang, Nels|title=Defining common ground for the Mesoamerican biological corridor|date=2001|publisher=World Resources Institute|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-156973-473-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Around 10.7% of Mesoamerica is currently under some category of protection for biodiversity conservation.”  &lt;ref name=declerk /&gt;

== Conservation efforts ==
The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor is a program that “integrates protection areas into a single, functional conservation area”.&lt;ref name="declerk" /&gt; Their goal is to promote “regional scale connectivity of protected areas with sustainable development and improvement of human livelihoods.”&lt;ref name="declerk" /&gt; The purpose of the corridor is to emphasize the conservation movement as being a social and group effort. One issue with conservation efforts arise from the discontinuity of government and politics across the corridor; areas are often fragmented and up to 40% of protected areas go unenforced because it crosses nations barriers.&lt;ref name="declerk" /&gt; The rapid increase in human population growth negatively affects conservation. Although this growth has been paired with rapid urbanization, the majority of the MBC population still resides in rural areas and “depends directly on biological resources for subsistence.”&lt;ref name=johnson /&gt; This dependency has led to exploitation that is difficult to quantify and regulate by the nations’ governments and conservation groups.
 
As of 2010, SICAP (Central American System of Protected Areas) encompasses 669 protected areas that total 124,250 square kilometers.&lt;ref name="declerk" /&gt; Yet, conservation efforts are hindered and negatively impacted by the fragmentation of land parcels and cross-national political differences and tension. Most of the protected areas are roughly 18,400 hectares, while only 18 areas exceeded 1,000 square kilometers.&lt;ref name=johnson /&gt; Presently, most conservation efforts are in promoting [[sustainable development]] and mitigating the damage done to the area by [[deforestation]]. Deforestation in the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor peaked between the 1970s and the 1990s. Planting native trees is the main method of restoring ecosystems after deforestation.

== Benefits ==
Due to the corridor having been recently developed there has not been any studies that specifically address the benefits. Future studies should be completed to examine the differences in animal populations prior to the corridor and after implementation.

== Controversy ==

When the Mesoamerican Biological Corridor was in the planning process there was a lack of formal functions proposed.&lt;ref name=IEG /&gt; The stakeholders did not have a clear idea of what the exact functions of the MBC were, which led to anger and an increase in the time taken to implement the corridor. The MBC was originally conceived as a way to protect threatened and endangered wildlife by connecting fragments of habitats and forming buffer zones to limit human land use.&lt;ref name=IEG /&gt; However, many of the interested stakeholders wanted to include common livelihood problems such as pollution, water and sanitation, pesticides contamination, firewood acquisition, zoonotic and infectious disease.&lt;ref name=Grandia /&gt; It was finally decided that the main goals of the corridor would be to facilitate animal movements along the Americas without interfering with human development and land use, while promoting ecological sustainability.&lt;ref name=Ray /&gt; Indigenous people were barely involved in these decisions and the zone boundaries were made without their input. This lack of input led to distrust and tension between the locals and corridor implementers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Finley-Brook|first1=Mary|title=Green Neoliberal Space: The Mesoamerican Biological Corridor|journal=Journal of Latin American Geography|date=2007|volume=6|issue=1|pages=101–124|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_latin_american_geography/v006/6.1finley-brook.html|accessdate=11 October 2014|doi=10.1353/lag.2007.0000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to promote ecological sustainability, payment for various environmental services are given to  landowners in order to motivate reforestation on their land. A major issue with these programs is that most small landholders do not have titles to the land. These small landholders were given plots to cultivate when they worked on larger farms or many were displaced migrants who settled in unclaimed lands. Since they have no legal documentation of land ownership they can’t apply for many of the correct land use incentives, thus little consideration of long-term effects on the land is given.&lt;ref name=johnson /&gt; Another issue is that the programs don’t differentiate between small-scale and large-scale landowners. In an effort to reduce Carbon emissions the MBC offers incentives for carbon sinks. Large-scale landowners have taken advantage of these systems by planting African Oil Palms on their lands. These plants provide them with more [[carbon credit]]s whereas a small landowner who is maintaining forest will receive little to no carbon credits&lt;ref name=Grandia /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3618">The '''moral high ground''', in ethical or political parlance, refers to the status of being respected for remaining moral, and adhering to and upholding a universally recognized standard of justice or goodness.
:"Parties seeking the moral high ground simply refuse to act in ways which are not viewed as legitimate and morally defensible."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/conflict/peace/treatment/moralhg.htm Moral High Ground] - International Online Training Program On Intractable Conflict - Conflict Research Consortium, University of Colorado, USA&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Holding the moral high ground can be used to legitimize [[political movements]], notably [[nonviolent resistance]], especially in the face of violent opposition,&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Johnson, ''Gandhi's Experiment with Truth'' (2006) p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and has been used by [[civil disobedience]] movements around the world to garner sympathy and support from society.

Similarly, 21st century states may refrain from declaring war in order to retain the moral high ground – though the cynic will observe that [[realpolitik]] still leads to wars being ''fought'', only without declarations.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Dinstein, ''War, Aggression and Self-Defence'' (2005) p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business==
Economist and social critic [[Robert H. Frank]] challenged the idea that prosocial behavior was necessarily deleterious in business in his book ''What Price the Moral High Ground?''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/titles/7602.html What Price the Moral High Ground: Ethical Dilemmas in Competitive Environments] - Robert H. Frank, {{ISBN|0-691-00672-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He argued that socially responsible firms often reap unexpected benefits even in highly competitive environments, because their commitment to principle makes them more attractive as partners to do business with.&lt;ref&gt;A. Teniati, ''The Collaborative Enterprise'' (2010) p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Everyday use==

In everyday use a person may take the perspective of the 'moral high ground' in order to produce a [[critique]] of something, or merely to win an argument. This perspective is sometimes associated to [[snobbery]] but may also be a legitimate way of taking up a stance.

Social sciences or philosophies are sometimes accused of taking the 'moral high ground' because they are often inherently interested in the project of human freedom and justice. The traditional project of education itself may be seen as defending a type of moral high ground from [[popular culture]], perhaps by using [[critical pedagogy]]: its proponents may themselves be accused (rightly or wrongly) of seeking a false and unjustified sense of superiority thereby.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Shippey, ''Tolkien'' (2001) p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminism==
Kate Fillion considered that in the wake of [[second-wave feminism]] "assumptions about female moral superiority pervade the public discourse", placing women as "comrades on the moral high ground, pitted against a common adversary who dwells in the shadowy depths far below".&lt;ref&gt;Kate Fillion, ''Lip Service'' (1997) p. 305 and p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Robert Lowell]] took the moral high ground, not once, but twice, with separate American presidents, in protesting US militarism.&lt;ref&gt;Seamus Heaney, '' Finders Keepers'' (2002) p. 205-10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Mandelson]] considered that [[Tony Blair]] was "good at taking the high ground and throwing himself off it".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Simon Jenkins, ''Thatcher and Sons'' (2007) p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

Many double stranded RNA elements that have been described in fungi do not fit this description, and in these cases they are referred to as virus like particles or [[Virus-like particle|VLPs]]. Preliminary results indicate that most mycoviruses codiverge with their hosts, i.e. their [[phylogeny]] is largely congruent with the one of their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Göker M, Scheuner C, Klenk HP, Stielow JB, Menzel W | title = Codivergence of mycoviruses with their hosts | journal = PLOS One | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = e22252 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21829452 | pmc = 3146478 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0022252 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many virus families containing mycoviruses have only sparsely been sampled.

It is a special subdivision of the general field of [[virology]] and describes taxonomy, host range, origin and evolution, transmission and movement of mycoviruses and their impact on host phenotype.

==History==
The first record of an economic impact of mycoviruses on fungi was recorded in cultivated mushrooms (''[[Agaricus bisporus]]'') in the late 1940s and was called the La France disease.&lt;ref name="Hollings" &gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hollings M  | year=1962 |title=Viruses Associated with A Die-Back Disease of Cultivated Mushroom |journal=Nature |volume=196 |issue=4858 |pages=962–965 |doi=10.1038/196962a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hollings found more than three different types of viruses in the abnormal [[sporophore]]s. This report marks the beginning of [[mycovirology]].&lt;ref name="Ghabrial" /&gt;

The La France Disease is also known as X disease, watery stripe, dieback and brown disease. [[Symptoms]] include:
* Reduced [[Crop yield|yield]]
* Slow and aberrant [[mycelial]] growth
* Waterlogging of tissue
* [[malformation]]
* Premature maturation
* Increased post-harvest deterioration (reduced shelf life)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Romaine CP, Schlagnhaufer B | title = PCR analysis of the viral complex associated with La France disease of Agaricus bisporus | journal = Applied and Environmental Microbiology | volume = 61 | issue = 6 | pages = 2322–5 | date = June 1995 | pmid = 7793952 | pmc = 167503 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mushrooms have shown no resistance to the virus, and so control has had to be via [[hygienic]] practises to stop the spread of the virus.

However, the best known mycovirus is ''[[Cryphonectria parasitica]]'' hypovirus 1 (CHV1). CHV1 is exceptional amongst mycoviral research due its success as biocontrol agent against chestnut blight in Europe, but also because it is a model organism for studying hypovirulence in fungi. However, this system is only being used in Europe routinely, because of the relative small number of vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) on this continent. In contrast, in North America the distribution of the hypovirulent phenotype is often prevented because fungal hyphae cannot fuse and exchange their cytoplasmic content due to an incompatibility reaction. In the United States of America at least 35 VCGs were found.&lt;ref name=Anagnostakis &gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anagnostakis SL, Chen B, Geletka LM, Nuss DL | title = Hypovirus Transmission to Ascospore Progeny by Field-Released Transgenic Hypovirulent Strains of Cryphonectria parasitica | journal = Phytopathology | volume = 88 | issue = 7 | pages = 598–604 | date = July 1998 | pmid = 18944931 | doi = 10.1094/PHYTO.1998.88.7.598 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar situation seems to be present in China and Japan where 71 VCGs were identified so far.&lt;ref name=Liu&amp;Milgroom &gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu YC, Milgroom MG | title = High diversity of vegetative compatibility types in Cryphonectria parasitica in Japan and China | journal = Mycologia | volume = 99 | issue = 2 | pages = 279–84 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17682780 | doi = 10.3852/mycologia.99.2.279 | url = http://www.mycologia.org/content/99/2/279.full.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The majority of mycoviruses have double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genomes and isometric particles, but approximately 30% have positive sense, single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) genomes.&lt;ref name="Pearson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Boz" /&gt; So far there is only one true example of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) mycovirus. A geminivirus-related virus was found in ''[[Sclerotinia sclerotiorum]]'' conferring hypovirulence to its host.&lt;ref name= "Yu"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu X, Li B, Fu Y, Jiang D, Ghabrial SA, Li G, Peng Y, Xie J, Cheng J, Huang J, Yi X | title = A geminivirus-related DNA mycovirus that confers hypovirulence to a plant pathogenic fungus | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 18 | pages = 8387–92 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20404139 | pmc = 2889581 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0913535107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The updated 9th ICTV report on virus taxonomy&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ictvonline.org], King, A.

==Host range and incidence==
Mycoviruses are common in fungi (Herrero et al., 2009) and are found in all four phyla of the true fungi: ''Chytridiomycota'', ''Zygomycota'', ''[[Ascomycota]]'' and ''[[Basidiomycota]]''. Fungi are frequently infected with two or more unrelated viruses and also with defective dsRNA and/or satellite dsRNA.&lt;ref name="Ghabrial2"&gt;Ghabrial, S. A., Suzuki, N. (2008). Fungal Viruses. In B. W. J. Mahy and M. H. V. Van Regenmortel (ed.), Encyclopedia of Virology, 3rd ed., vol. 2.

W. (1986). Fungal Virology- An overview', in K. Buck (ed.), Fungal Virology (Boca Raton: CRC Press): 1-84.&lt;/ref&gt; but some mycoviruses can replicate in taxonomically different fungal hosts.&lt;ref name="Ghabrial" /&gt; Good examples are mitoviruses found in the two fungal species ''Sclerotinia homoeocarpa'' and ''Ophiostoma novo-ulmi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Deng F, Xu R, Boland GJ | title = Hypovirulence-Associated Double-Stranded RNA from Sclerotinia homoeocarpa Is Conspecific with Ophiostoma novo-ulmi Mitovirus 3a-Ld | journal = Phytopathology | volume = 93 | issue = 11 | pages = 1407–14 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 18944069 | doi = 10.1094/PHYTO.2003.93.11.1407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuss et al.

==Origin and evolution==
DsRNA as well as ssRNA are assumed to be very ancient and presumably originated from the ‘RNA world’ as both types of RNA viruses infect bacteria as well as eukaryotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Forterre P | title = The origin of viruses and their possible roles in major evolutionary transitions | journal = Virus Research | volume = 117 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–16 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16476498 | doi = 10.1016/j.virusres.2006.01.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the origin of viruses is still not well understood,&lt;ref name="Koonin"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Wolf YI | title = Genomics of bacteria and archaea: the emerging dynamic view of the prokaryotic world | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 36 | issue = 21 | pages = 6688–719 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 18948295 | pmc = 2588523 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkn668 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recently presented data which suggest that viruses invaded the emerging ‘supergroups’ of eukaryotes from an ancestral pool in a very early stage of life on earth. According to Koonin,&lt;ref name="Koonin" /&gt; RNA viruses colonized eukaryotes first and subsequently co-evolved with their hosts. This concept fits well with the proposed ‘ancient co-evolution hypothesis’, which also assumes a long co-evolution of viruses and fungi.&lt;ref name="Pearson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Varga" /&gt; ‘The ancient coevolution hypothesis’ could contribute some explanation why mycoviruses are so diverse.&lt;ref name="Varga" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawe"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dawe AL, Nuss DL | title = Hypoviruses and chestnut blight: exploiting viruses to understand and modulate fungal pathogenesis | journal = Annual Review of Genetics | volume = 35 | issue =  | pages = 1–29 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11700275 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genet.35.102401.085929 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been suggested that it is very likely that plant viruses containing a movement protein have evolved from mycoviruses by introducing of an extracellular phase into their life cycle, rather than eliminating it. Furthermore, the recent discovery of an ssDNA mycovirus tempted some researchers&lt;ref name="Yu" /&gt; to suggest that RNA and DNA viruses might have common evolutionary mechanisms. However, there are many cases where mycoviruses are grouped together with plant viruses. For example, CHV1 showed phylogenetic relatedness to the ssRNA genus Potyvirus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Fauquet CM, Mayo MA, Maniloff J | date = 2005 | title = Virus Taxonomy: Classification and Nomenclature of Viruses: The Eighth Report of the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses. | location = San Diego, CA | publisher = Elsevier Academic }}&lt;/ref&gt; and some ssRNA viruses, which were assumed to confer hypovirulence or debilitation, were often found to be more closely related to plant viruses than to other mycoviruses.&lt;ref name="Pearson" /&gt; Therefore, another theory arose that these viruses moved from a plant host to plant pathogenic fungal host or vice versa. This ‘plant virus hypothesis’ may not explain how mycoviruses developed originally, but it could help to understand how they evolved further.

==Transmission==
A significant difference between the genomes of mycoviruses to other viruses is the absence of genes for ‘cell-to-cell movement’ proteins. It is therefore assumed that mycoviruses only move intercellularly during cell division (e.g. sporogenesis) or via hyphal fusion.&lt;ref name="Ghabrial2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Ghabrial SA | date = 1994 | chapter = New Developments in Fungal Virology | veditors = Murphy FA, Maramorosch K, Aaron JS | title = Advances in Virus Research | volume = 43 | publisher = Academic Press | pages = 303–388 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mycoviruses might simply not need an external route of infection as they have many means of transmission and spread due to their fungal host’s life style:

* Plasmogamy and cytoplasmic exchange over extended periods of time
* Production of vast amounts of asexual spores
* Overwintering via sclerotia&lt;ref name="Liu_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu H, Fu Y, Jiang D, Li G, Xie J, Peng Y, Yi X, Ghabrial SA | title = A novel mycovirus that is related to the human pathogen hepatitis E virus and rubi-like viruses | journal = Journal of Virology | volume = 83 | issue = 4 | pages = 1981–91 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19073734 | pmc = 2643757 | doi = 10.1128/JVI.01897-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* More or less effective transmission into sexual spores

However, there are potential barriers to mycovirus spread due to vegetative incompatibility and variable transmission to sexual spores. Transmission to sexually produced spores can range from 0% to 100% depending on the virus-host combination.&lt;ref name="Ghabrial2" /&gt; Transmission between species of the same genus sharing the same habitat has also been reported including ''Cryphonectria'' (''C. parasitica'' and ''C.'' sp), ''Sclerotinia'' (''[[Sclerotinia sclerotiorum]]'' and ''S. minor''), and ''Ophistoma'' (''O. ulmi'' and ''O. novo-ulmi'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu YC, Linder-Basso D, Hillman BI, Kaneko S, Milgroom MG | title = Evidence for interspecies transmission of viruses in natural populations of filamentous fungi in the genus Cryphonectria | journal = Molecular Ecology | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 1619–28 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12755889 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-294x.2003.01847.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Melzer MS, Deng F, Boland GJ | title = Asymptomatic infection, and distribution of ''Ophiostoma mitovirus'' 3a (OMV3a), in populations of ''Sclerotinia homoeocarpa'' | journal = Canadian Journal of Plant Pathology | date = December 2005 | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 610–5 | title-link = Sclerotinia homoeocarpa }}&lt;/ref&gt; Intraspecies transmission has also been reported&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Van Diepeningen AD, Debets AJ, Slakhorst SM, Fekete C, Hornok L, Hoekstra RF | date = 2000 | title = Interspecies virus transfer via protoplast fusions between ''Fusarium poae'' and black ''Aspergillus'' strains. | journal = Fungal Genetics Newsletter | volume = 47 | pages = 99–100 }}&lt;/ref&gt; between ''Fusarium poae'' and black ''[[Aspergillus]]'' isolates. However, it is not known how fungi overcome the genetic barrier; whether there is some form of recognition process during physical contact or some other means of exchange, such as vectors. Research&lt;ref name="Diep"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Diepeningen AD, Debets AJ, Hoekstra RF | title = Dynamics of dsRNA mycoviruses in black Aspergillus populations | journal = Fungal Genetics and Biology : FG &amp; B | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 446–52 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16546419 | doi = 10.1016/j.fgb.2006.01.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using ''[[Aspergillus]]'' species indicated that transmission efficiencies might depend on the hosts viral infection status (infected with no, different, or same virus), and that mycoviruses might play a role in the regulation of secondary mycoviral infection. Whether this is also true for other fungi is not yet known. In contrast to acquiring mycoviruses spontaneously, the loss of mycoviruses seems very infrequent&lt;ref name="Diep" /&gt; and suggests that either viruses actively moved into spores and new hyphal tips, or the fungus might facilitate the mycoviral transport in some other way.

==Movement of mycoviruses within fungi==
Although it is not known yet whether viral transport is an active or passive process, it is generally assumed that fungal viruses move forward by plasma streaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sasaki A, Kanematsu S, Onoue M, Oyama Y, Yoshida K | title = Infection of Rosellinia necatrix with purified viral particles of a member of Partitiviridae (RnPV1-W8) | journal = Archives of Virology | volume = 151 | issue = 4 | pages = 697–707 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16307176 | doi = 10.1007/s00705-005-0662-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretically they could drift with the cytoplasm as it extends into new hyphae, or attach to the web of microtubuli, which would drag them through the internal cytoplasmic space. That might explain how they pass through septa and bypass woronin bodies. However, some researchers have found them located next to septum walls,&lt;ref name="Boz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vilches S, Castillo A | title = A double-stranded RNA mycovirus in Botrytis cinerea | journal = FEMS Microbiology Letters | volume = 155 | issue = 1 | pages = 125–30 | date = October 1997 | pmid = 9345772 | doi = 10.1016/S0378-1097(97)00377-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which could imply that they ‘got stuck’ and were not able to move actively forward themselves. Others have suggested that the transmission of viral mitochondrial dsRNA may play an important role in the movement of mitoviruses found in ''[[Botrytis cinerea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wu M, Zhang L, Li G, Jiang D, Ghabrial SA | title = Genome characterization of a debilitation-associated mitovirus infecting the phytopathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea | journal = Virology | volume = 406 | issue = 1 | pages = 117–26 | date = October 2010 | pmid = 20674953 | doi = 10.1016/j.virol.2010.07.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on host phenotype==
Phenotypic effects of mycoviral infections can vary from advantageous to deleterious, but most of them are asymptomatic or cryptic. The connection between phenotype and mycovirus presence is not always straight forward. Several reasons may account for this. First, the lack of appropriate infectivity assays often hindered the researcher from reaching a coherent conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McCabe PM, Pfeiffer P, Van Alfen NK | title = The influence of dsRNA viruses on the biology of plant pathogenic fungi | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 7 | issue = 9 | pages = 377–81 | date = September 1999 | pmid = 10470047 | doi = 10.1016/S0966-842X(99)01568-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, mixed infection or unknown numbers of infecting viruses make it very difficult to associate a particular phenotypic change with the investigated virus.

Although most mycoviruses often do not seem to disturb their host’s fitness, this does not necessarily mean they are living unrecognized by their hosts. A neutral co-existence might just be the result of a long co-evolutionary process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = May RM, Nowak MA | title = Coinfection and the evolution of parasite virulence | journal = Proceedings. Biological Sciences | volume = 261 | issue = 1361 | pages = 209–15 | date = August 1995 | pmid = 7568274 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.1995.0138 | url = http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~ped/people/faculty/publications_nowak/ProcRoySoc95b.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Araújo, A., Jansen, A. M., Bouchet, F., Reinhard, K., Ferreira, L. F. (2003). Parasitism, the Diversity of Life, and Paleoparasitology. Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz, 98 (SUPPL. 1): 5-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, symptoms may only appear when certain conditions of the virus-fungus-system change and get out of balance. This could be external (environmental) as well as internal (cytoplasmic). It is not known yet why some mycoviruses-fungus-combinations are typically detrimental while others are asymptomatic or even beneficial. Nevertheless, harmful effects of mycoviruses are economically interesting, especially if the fungal host is a phytopathogen and the mycovirus could be exploited as biocontrol agent. The best example is represented by the case of CHV1 and ''C. parasitica''.&lt;ref name="Ghabrial2" /&gt; Other examples of deleterious effects of mycoviruses are the ‘La France’ disease of ''Agaricus biporus''&lt;ref name="Hollings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ro"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ro HS, Lee NJ, Lee CW, Lee HS | title = Isolation of a novel mycovirus OMIV in Pleurotus ostreatus and its detection using a triple antibody sandwich-ELISA | journal = Journal of Virological Methods | volume = 138 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 24–9 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 16930731 | doi = 10.1016/j.jviromet.2006.07.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mushroom diseases caused by Oyster mushroom spherical virus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu HJ, Lim D, Lee HS | title = Characterization of a novel single-stranded RNA mycovirus in Pleurotus ostreatus | journal = Virology | volume = 314 | issue = 1 | pages = 9–15 | date = September 2003 | pmid = 14517055 | doi = 10.1016/S0042-6822(03)00382-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Oyster mushroom isometric virus.&lt;ref name="Ro" /&gt;

In summary, the main negative effects of mycoviruses are:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10813">{{Environmental law}}
In [[environmental law]], the '''polluter pays principle''' is enacted to make the [[Party (law)|party]] responsible for producing [[pollution]] responsible for paying for the damage done to the [[natural environment]]. It is regarded as a regional custom because of the strong support it has received in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[European Union]] countries. It is a fundamental principle in US environmental law.

== History ==
According to the French [[historian of the environment]] Jean-Baptiste Fressoz, [[financial compensation]] (not named "polluter pays principle" at that time) is already the regulation principle of [[Industrial pollution|pollution]] favoured by industrials in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=Ulmi&gt;{{fr}} Nic Ulmi, [https://www.letemps.ch/sciences/2016/10/18/aux-origines-crise-ecologique "Aux origines de la crise écologique"] [The origins of the ecological crisis], ''[[Le temps]]'', 18 October 2016 (page visited on 22 October 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that: "This principle, which is now offered as a new solution, actually accompanied the process of industrialisation, and was intended by the manufacturers themselves."&lt;ref name=Ulmi/&gt;

== Applications in environmental law==
The polluter pays principle underpins environmental policy such as an [[ecotax]], which, if enacted by government, deters and essentially reduces [[greenhouse gas emissions]]. This principle is based on the fact that as much as pollution is unavoidable, the person or industry that is responsible for the pollution must pay some money for the rehabilitation of the polluted environment.

The state of [[New South Wales]] in [[Australia]] has included the polluter pay principle with the other principles of [[ecologically sustainable development]] in the objectives of the Environment Protection Authority.&lt;ref&gt;Protection of the Environment Administration Act 1991, section 6(2)(d)(i)[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/poteaa1991485/s6.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union===
The polluter pays principle is set out in the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] &lt;ref&gt;Article 191(2) TFEU&lt;/ref&gt; and Directive 2004/35/EC of the [[European Parliament]] and of the [[European Council|Council]] of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage is based on this principle. The directive entered into force on 30 April 2004; member states were allowed three years to transpose the [[Directive (European Union)|directive]] into their domestic law and by July 2010 all member states had completed this.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, [http://ec.europa.eu/environment/legal/liability/ Environmental Liability], accessed 29 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== France ===
In France, the Charter for the Environment contains a formulation of the polluter pays principle (article 4):
{{Block quote|Everyone shall be required, in the conditions provided for by law, to contribute to the making good of any damage he or she may have caused to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/anglais/charter_environnement.pdf ''Charter for the Environment''], [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council]] (page visited on 28 August 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ghana===
In [[Ghana]], the polluter pays principle was adopted in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Ghana Business News, [https://www.ghanabusinessnews.com/2011/12/08/cabinet-approves-polluter-pays-principle/ Cabinet approves Polluter Pays Principle], 8 December 2011, accessed 29 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
The polluter pays principle is also known as '''extended producer responsibility''' (EPR). This is a concept that was probably first described by Thomas Lindhqvist for the [[Swedish government]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;The International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics at Lund University, Sweden (2000).[http://www.lub.lu.se/luft/diss/tec355.pdf "Extended Producer Responsibility in Cleaner Production"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140513010736/http://www.lub.lu.se/luft/diss/tec355.pdf |date=2014-05-13 }} Doctoral Dissertation (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; EPR seeks to shift the responsibility of dealing with waste from [[government]]s (and thus, [[taxpayer]]s and society at large) to the entities producing it. In effect, it internalised the cost of waste disposal into the cost of the product, theoretically meaning that the producers will improve the waste profile of their products, thus decreasing waste and increasing possibilities for reuse and recycling.

The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] defines extended producer responsibility as: &lt;blockquote&gt;
a concept where manufacturers and importers of products should bear a significant degree of responsibility for the environmental impacts of their products throughout the product life-cycle, including upstream impacts inherent in the selection of materials for the products, impacts from manufacturers’ production process itself, and downstream impacts from the use and disposal of the products. Producers accept their responsibility when designing their products to minimise life-cycle environmental impacts, and when accepting legal, physical or socio-economic responsibility for environmental impacts that cannot be eliminated by design.&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Environment Directorate, Paris, France (2006).[http://www.oecd.org/document/53/0,3343,en_2649_34395_37284725_1_1_1_1,00.html "Extended Producer Responsibility."] Project Fact Sheet.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Switzerland ===
The [[waste management in Switzerland]] is based on the polluter pays principle.&lt;ref name=Skjellaug/&gt; [[Bin bag]]s (for [[municipal solid waste]]) are taxed with [[Pay as you throw|pay-per-bag fees]] in three quarters of the [[Municipalities of Switzerland|communes]] (and the recycling rate doubled in twenty years).&lt;ref name=Skjellaug&gt;{{fr}} Aïna Skjellaug, [https://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2016/09/06/lautre-or-suisse-dechets "L’autre or de la Suisse, ses déchets"], ''[[Le temps]]'', Tuesday 6 September 2016 (page visited on 6 September 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) Regulations 2009 (for England) and the Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) (Wales) Regulations 2009 (for Wales) established the operation of the polluter pays principle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130402182915/http://archive.defra.gov.uk/environment/policy/liability/pdf/quick-guide-regs09.pdf The Environmental Damage Regulations: Preventing and Remedying Environmental Damage], accessed 29 October 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The principle is employed in all of the major US pollution control laws: [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/air-enforcement |title=Air Enforcement |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-12-01 |publisher=US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clean Water Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/water-enforcement |title=Water Enforcement |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-12-14 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (solid waste and hazardous waste management),&lt;ref name="EPA-waste"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/enforcement/waste-chemical-and-cleanup-enforcement |title=Waste, Chemical, and Cleanup Enforcement |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-01-07 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Superfund]] (cleanup of abandoned waste sites).&lt;ref name="EPA-waste"/&gt;

Some eco-taxes underpinned by the polluter pays principle include:
* the [[Gas Guzzler Tax]] for motor vehicles
* [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE), a "polluter pays" [[Fine (penalty)|fine]].
* the Superfund law requires polluters to pay for cleanup of hazardous waste sites, when the polluters can be identified.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite report |date=June 1996 |title=The Buck Stops Here: Polluters are Paying for Most Hazardous Waste Cleanups |periodical=Superfund Today (newsletter) |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=10001XKT.txt |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-540-K-96/004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, an [[Polluter pays amendment|amendment]] was passed negating the "polluter pays" provision of the [[Constitution of Florida|Florida Constitution]].

====Limitations of polluter pays principle====
The US [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has observed that the polluter pays principle has typically not been fully implemented in [[United States environmental law|US laws]] and programs. For example, [[water purification|drinking water]] and [[sewage treatment]] services are [[subsidy|subsidized]] and there are limited mechanisms in place to fully assess polluters for treatment costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2003 |title=Water and Wastewater Pricing: An Informational Overview |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/901U1200.PDF?Dockey=901U1200.PDF |publisher=EPA |id=EPA-832-F-03-027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zimbabwe===
The [[Zimbabwe]] Environmental Management Act of 2002 &lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.kubatana.net/docs/legisl/env_mgmt_act_060325.pdf Chapter 20:27]&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits the discharge of pollutants into the environment. In line with the "Polluter Pays" principle, the Act requires a polluter to meet the cost of decontaminating the polluted environment.&lt;ref&gt;The Herald (Harare), [http://www.herald.co.zw/polluter-pays-as-environmental-management-principle/ Polluter pays as environmental management principle], 18 May 2016, accessed 6 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pseudophysics''' is a [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] practice using the language of [[physics]] or discussing issues related to or pertinent to physics to promote ideas which are either incoherent or contradictory to known physics (experimental phenomenology). According to physicists, skeptics, and science writers, pseudophysics tends to be promoted by so-called "[[crank (person)|cranks]]",&lt;ref&gt;http://physics.about.com/b/2012/02/17/physicscranks.htm&lt;/ref&gt; whose ideas lack [[peer review]], lack [[falsifiability|falsifiable predictions]], and/or blatantly contradict scientific facts and experimental results. [[Mathematical physicist]] [[John C. Baez]] famously invented a [[crackpot index]] to give an idea of what sort of claims and rhetoric were commonplace among pseudophysics proposals he had come across.&lt;ref&gt;http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''racetrack problem''' is a specific instance of a type of [[race condition]]. A racetrack problem is a flaw in a system or process whereby the output and/or result of the process is unexpectedly and critically dependent on the sequence or timing of other events that run in a circular pattern. Note that this problem is semantically different from a race condition because of the circular nature of the problem.

The term originates with the idea of two signals racing each other in a circular motion to influence the output first.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Racetrack problems can occur in electronics systems, especially logic circuits, and in computer software, especially multithreaded or distributed programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26061">'''Secretion''' is the movement of material from one point to another, e.g. secreted [[chemical substance]] from a [[cell (biology)|cell]] or [[gland]]. In contrast, [[excretion]], is the removal of certain substances or waste products from a cell or organism. The classical mechanism of cell secretion is via secretory portals at the cell plasma membrane called [[porosomes]].&lt;ref name="pmid 22659300"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee JS, Jeremic A, Shin L, Cho WJ, Chen X, Jena BP | title = Neuronal porosome proteome: Molecular dynamics and architecture | journal = Journal of Proteomics | volume = 75 | issue = 13 | pages = 3952–62 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22659300 | doi = 10.1016/j.jprot.2012.05.017 | pmc = 4580231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Porosomes are permanent cup-shaped lipoprotein structure at the cell plasma membrane, where secretory vesicles transiently dock and fuse to release intra-vesicular contents from the cell.

[[Bacterial secretion system|Secretion in bacterial species]] means the transport or translocation of effector molecules for example: [[proteins]], [[enzymes]] or [[toxin]]s (such as [[cholera toxin]] in [[pathogenic bacteria]] for example ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'') from across the interior ([[cytoplasm]] or [[cytosol]]) of a bacterial cell to its exterior. Secretion is a very important mechanism in bacterial functioning and operation in their natural surrounding environment for adaptation and survival.

==In eukaryotic cells==
[[File:Porosome for wiki-2.jpg|thumb|240px|Porosome]]

===Mechanism===
[[Eukaryote|Eukaryotic]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]], including [[human cells]], have a highly [[evolution|evolved]] process of secretion. Proteins [[Protein targeting|targeted]] for the outside are [[protein synthesis|synthesized]] by [[ribosome]]s docked to the rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER). As they are synthesized, these proteins translocate into the ER [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]], where they are [[Glycosylation|glycosylated]] and where molecular [[Chaperone (protein)|chaperone]]s aid [[protein folding]]. [[Misfolded proteins]] are usually identified here and retrotranslocated by [[Endoplasmic-reticulum-associated protein degradation|ER-associated degradation]] to the [[cytosol]], where they are degraded by a [[proteasome]]. The [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s containing the properly folded proteins then enter the [[Golgi apparatus]].

In the Golgi apparatus, the glycosylation of the proteins is modified and further [[posttranslational modifications]], including cleavage and functionalization, may occur. The [[proteins]] are then moved into secretory vesicles which travel along the [[cytoskeleton]] to the edge of the cell. More modification can occur in the secretory vesicles (for example [[insulin]] is cleaved from [[proinsulin]] in the secretory vesicles).

Eventually, there is [[vesicle fusion]] with the [[cell membrane]] at a structure called the [[porosome]], in a process called [[exocytosis]], dumping its contents out of the cell's environment.&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anderson LL | title = Discovery of the 'porosome'; the universal secretory machinery in cells | journal = Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 126–31 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16563225 | doi = 10.1111/j.1582-4934.2006.tb00294.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Strict [[biochemical]] control is maintained over this sequence by usage of a [[pH]] gradient: the pH of the cytosol is 7.4, the ER's pH is 7.0, and the cis-golgi has a pH of 6.5. Secretory vesicles have pHs ranging between 5.0 and 6.0; some secretory vesicles evolve into [[lysosome]]s, which have a pH of 4.8.

==== Nonclassical secretion====
There are many proteins like [[FGF1]] (aFGF), [[FGF2]] (bFGF), [[interleukin-1]] (IL1) etc. which do not have a signal sequence. They do not use the classical ER-golgi pathway. These are secreted through various nonclassical pathways.

At least four nonclassical (unconventional) protein secretion pathways have been described.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nickel W, Seedorf M | title = Unconventional mechanisms of protein transport to the cell surface of eukaryotic cells | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 24 | pages = 287–308 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18590485 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.24.110707.175320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They include 1) direct translocation of proteins across the plasma membrane likely through membrane transporters, 2) blebbing, 3) lysosomal secretion, and 4) release via exosomes derived from multivesicular bodies. In addition, proteins can be released from cells by mechanical or physiological wounding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McNeil PL, Steinhardt RA | title = Plasma membrane disruption: repair, prevention, adaptation | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 19 | pages = 697–731 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14570587 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.19.111301.140101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and through nonlethal, transient oncotic pores in the plasma membrane induced by washing cells with serum-free media or buffers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chirico WJ | title = Protein release through nonlethal oncotic pores as an alternative nonclassical secretory pathway | journal = BMC Cell Biology | volume = 12 | pages = 46 | date = October 2011 | pmid = 22008609 | pmc = 3217904 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2121-12-46 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In human tissues===
Many [[human cell types]] have the ability to be secretory cells. They have a well-developed [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[Golgi apparatus]] to fulfill their function. [[Tissue (biology)|Tissues]] in humans that produce secretions include the [[gastrointestinal tract]] which secretes [[digestive enzyme]]s and [[gastric acid]], the [[lung]] which secretes [[surfactant]]s, and [[sebaceous gland]]s which secrete sebum to lubricate the skin and hair. [[Meibomian gland]]s in the eyelid secrete sebum to lubricate and protect the eye.

== In gram-negative bacteria==
{{main|Bacterial secretion system}}
Secretion is not unique to eukaryotes alone - it is present in bacteria and archaea as well. [[ATP binding cassette]] (ABC) type transporters are common to all the three domains of life. The Sec system constituting the Sec Y-E-G complex (see Type II secretion system (T2SS), below) is another conserved secretion system, homologous to the translocon in the eukaryotic endoplasmic reticulum and the Sec 61 translocon complex of yeast. Some secreted proteins are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane by the Sec translocon, which requires the presence of an N-terminal signal peptide on the secreted protein. Others are translocated across the cytoplasmic membrane by the [[twin-arginine translocation pathway]] (Tat).  [[Gram-negative bacteria]] have two membranes, thus making secretion topologically more complex. There are at least six specialized secretion systems in gram-negative bacteria. Many secreted proteins are particularly important in bacterial pathogenesis.&lt;ref name= WooldridgeK&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Wooldridge |editor1-first=K |year=2009 |title=Bacterial Secreted Proteins: Secretory Mechanisms and Role in Pathogenesis |publisher=Caister Academic Press |isbn=978-1-904455-42-4}}{{page needed|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Type I secretion system (T1SS or TOSS)===
[[Image:T1SS.svg|200px|right]]
Type I secretion is a chaperone dependent secretion system employing the Hly and Tol gene clusters. The process begins as a leader sequence HlyA is recognized and binds HlyB on the membrane. This signal sequence is extremely specific for the ABC transporter. The HlyAB complex stimulates HlyD which begins to uncoil and reaches the outer membrane where TolC recognizes a terminal molecule or signal on HlyD. HlyD recruits TolC to the inner membrane and HlyA is excreted outside of the outer membrane via a long-tunnel protein channel.

Type I secretion system transports various molecules, from ions, drugs, to proteins of various sizes (20 – 900 kDa). The molecules secreted vary in size from the small ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' peptide colicin V, (10 kDa) to the ''[[Pseudomonas fluorescens]]'' cell adhesion protein LapA of 520 kDa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boyd CD, Smith TJ, El-Kirat-Chatel S, Newell PD, Dufrêne YF, O'Toole GA | title = Structural features of the Pseudomonas fluorescens biofilm adhesin LapA required for LapG-dependent cleavage, biofilm formation, and cell surface localization | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 196 | issue = 15 | pages = 2775–88 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24837291 | pmc = 4135675 | doi = 10.1128/JB.01629-14 | url = http://jb.asm.org/content/196/15/2775 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best characterized are the [[RTX toxin]]s and the lipases. Type I secretion is also involved in export of non-proteinaceous substrates like cyclic β-glucans and polysaccharides.

[[Image:T2SS.svg|200px|left]]

===Type II secretion system (T2SS)===
{{Main article|Type II secretion system}}
Proteins secreted through the type II system, or main terminal branch of the general secretory pathway, depend on the Sec or Tat system for initial transport into the [[periplasm]]. Once there, they pass through the outer membrane via a multimeric (12–14 subunits) complex of pore forming secretin proteins. In addition to the secretin protein, 10–15 other inner and outer membrane proteins compose the full secretion apparatus, many with as yet unknown function. Gram-negative [[Pilus#Type IV pili|type IV pili]] use a modified version of the type II system for their biogenesis, and in some cases certain proteins are shared between a pilus complex and type II system within a single bacterial species.

===Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)===
{{Main article|Type three secretion system}}
[[Image:T3SS.svg|200px|right]]
It is homologous to the basal body in bacterial flagella. It is like a molecular syringe through which a bacterium (e.g. certain types of ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''[[Shigella]]'', ''[[Yersinia]]'', ''[[Vibrio]]'') can inject proteins into eukaryotic cells. The low Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration in the cytosol opens the gate that regulates T3SS. One such mechanism to detect low calcium concentration has been illustrated by the lcrV (Low Calcium Response) antigen utilized by ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'', which is used to detect low calcium concentrations and elicits T3SS attachment. The Hrp system in plant pathogens inject harpins and pathogen effector proteins through similar mechanisms into plants. This secretion system was first discovered in ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' and showed that toxins could be injected directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into the cytoplasm of its host's cells rather than simply be secreted into the extracellular medium.&lt;ref&gt;Salyers, A.

It is homologous to [[Bacterial conjugation|conjugation]] machinery of bacteria. It is capable of transporting both DNA and proteins. It was discovered in ''Agrobacterium tumefaciens'', which uses this system to introduce the T-DNA portion of the Ti plasmid into the plant host, which in turn causes the affected area to develop into a crown gall (tumor). ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' uses a type IV secretion system to deliver [[CagA]] into gastric epithelial cells, which is associated with gastric carcinogenesis.&lt;ref name="pmid16367902"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hatakeyama M, Higashi H | title = Helicobacter pylori CagA: a new paradigm for bacterial carcinogenesis | journal = Cancer Science | volume = 96 | issue = 12 | pages = 835–43 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16367902 | doi = 10.1111/j.1349-7006.2005.00130.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bordetella pertussis]]'', the causative agent of whooping cough, secretes the [[pertussis toxin]] partly through the type IV system.

==== Function ====
In short, Type IV secretion system (T4SS), is the general mechanism by which bacterial cells secrete or take up macromolecules. Their precise mechanism remains unknown. T4SS is encoded on [[Gram negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] conjugative elements in [[bacteria]].T4SS are cell envelope-spanning complexes or in other words 11–13 core proteins that form a channel through which DNA and proteins can travel from the cytoplasm of the donor cell to the cytoplasm of the recipient cell. Additionally, T4SS also secrete [[virulence]] factor proteins directly into host cells as well as taking up DNA from the medium during natural [[Transformation (bacteria)|transformation]], which shows the versatility of this macromolecular secretion apparatus.&lt;ref name="pmid12855161"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lawley TD, Klimke WA, Gubbins MJ, Frost LS | title = F factor conjugation is a true type IV secretion system | journal = FEMS Microbiology Letters | volume = 224 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–15 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12855161 | doi = 10.1016/S0378-1097(03)00430-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Structure ====
As shown in the above figure, TraC, in particular consists of a three helix bundle and a loose globular appendage.&lt;ref name="pmid14673074" /&gt;

==== Interactions ====
T4SS has two effector proteins: firstly, ATS-1, which stands for Anaplasma translocated substrate 1, and secondly [[Ankyrin repeat|AnkA]], which stands for ankyrin repeat domain-containing protein A. Additionally, T4SS coupling proteins are VirD4, which bind to VirE2.&lt;ref name="pmid20670295"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rikihisa Y, Lin M, Niu H | title = Type IV secretion in the obligatory intracellular bacterium Anaplasma phagocytophilum | journal = Cellular Microbiology | volume = 12 | issue = 9 | pages = 1213–21 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20670295 | pmc = 3598623 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-5822.2010.01500.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Type V secretion system (T5SS)===
{{See also|Trimeric autotransporter adhesin#Type V secretion system (T5SS)}}
[[Image:T5SS.svg|250px|right]]
Also called the autotransporter system,&lt;ref name=Thanassi2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thanassi DG, Stathopoulos C, Karkal A, Li H | title = Protein secretion in the absence of ATP: the autotransporter, two-partner secretion and chaperone/usher pathways of gram-negative bacteria (review) | journal = Molecular Membrane Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 1-2 | pages = 63–72 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16092525 | doi = 10.1080/09687860500063290 }}&lt;/ref&gt; type V secretion involves use of the ''Sec'' system for crossing the inner membrane. Proteins which use this pathway have the capability to form a beta-barrel with their C-terminus which inserts into the outer membrane, allowing the rest of the peptide (the passenger domain) to reach the outside of the cell. Often, autotransporters are cleaved, leaving the beta-barrel domain in the outer membrane and freeing the passenger domain. Some researchers believe remnants of the autotransporters gave rise to the porins which form similar beta-barrel structures.&lt;ref name="Friesland"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Friesland, Brooke et al |title=Structural analysis of autotransporter components and the origin of porins |journal=Int J Mol Biochem |date=2011 |volume=29 |issue=13 |pages=92-112}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common example of an autotransporter that uses this secretion system is the [[Trimeric Autotransporter Adhesins (TAA)|Trimeric Autotransporter Adhesins]].&lt;ref name="pmid17482513"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gerlach RG, Hensel M | title = Protein secretion systems and adhesins: the molecular armory of Gram-negative pathogens | journal = International Journal of Medical Microbiology | volume = 297 | issue = 6 | pages = 401–15 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17482513 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijmm.2007.03.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Type VI secretion system (T6SS)===
{{Main article|Type VI secretion system}}

Type VI secretion systems  were originally identified in 2006 by the group of John Mekalanos at the Harvard Medical School (Boston, USA) in two bacterial pathogens, ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid16432199"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pukatzki S, Ma AT, Sturtevant D, Krastins B, Sarracino D, Nelson WC, Heidelberg JF, Mekalanos JJ | title = Identification of a conserved bacterial protein secretion system in Vibrio cholerae using the Dictyostelium host model system | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 103 | issue = 5 | pages = 1528–33 | date = January 2006 | pmid = 16432199 | pmc = 1345711 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0510322103 | bibcode = 2006PNAS..103.1528P | jstor = 30048406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16763151"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mougous JD, Cuff ME, Raunser S, Shen A, Zhou M, Gifford CA, Goodman AL, Joachimiak G, Ordoñez CL, Lory S, Walz T, Joachimiak A, Mekalanos JJ | title = A virulence locus of Pseudomonas aeruginosa encodes a protein secretion apparatus | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5779 | pages = 1526–30 | date = June 2006 | pmid = 16763151 | pmc = 2800167 | doi = 10.1126/science.1128393 | bibcode = 2006Sci...312.1526M }}&lt;/ref&gt; These were identified when mutations in the Hcp and VrgG genes in ''Vibrio Cholerae'' led to decreased virulence and pathogenicity. Since then, Type VI secretion systems have been found in a quarter of all proteobacterial genomes, including animal, plant, human pathogens, as well as soil, environmental or marine bacteria.&lt;ref name="pmid18289922"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bingle LE, Bailey CM, Pallen MJ | title = Type VI secretion: a beginner's guide | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–8 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18289922 | doi = 10.1016/j.mib.2008.01.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18617888"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cascales E | title = The type VI secretion toolkit | journal = EMBO Reports | volume = 9 | issue = 8 | pages = 735–41 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18617888 | pmc = 2515208 | doi = 10.1038/embor.2008.131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While most of the early studies of Type VI secretion focused on its role in the pathogenesis of higher organisms, more recent studies suggested a broader physiological role in defense against simple eukaryotic predators and its role in inter-bacteria interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schwarz S, Hood RD, Mougous JD | title = What is type VI secretion doing in all those bugs? | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 18 | issue = 12 | pages = 531–7 | date = December 2010 | pmid = 20961764 | pmc = 2991376 | doi = 10.1016/j.tim.2010.09.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coulthurst 2013 S0923-2508"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Coulthurst SJ | title = The Type VI secretion system - a widespread and versatile cell targeting system | journal = Research in Microbiology | volume = 164 | issue = 6 | pages = 640–54 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23542428 | doi = 10.1016/j.resmic.2013.03.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Type VI secretion system gene clusters contain from 15 to more than 20 genes, two of which, Hcp and VgrG, have been shown to be nearly universally secreted substrates of the system. Structural analysis of these and other proteins in this system bear a striking resemblance to the tail spike of the T4 phage, and the activity of the system is thought to functionally resemble phage infection.&lt;ref name="Silverman 2012 453-472"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Silverman JM, Brunet YR, Cascales E, Mougous JD | title = Structure and regulation of the type VI secretion system | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 66 | pages = 453–72 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22746332 | pmc = 3595004 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-micro-121809-151619 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release of outer membrane vesicles===
In addition to the use of the multiprotein complexes listed above, Gram-negative bacteria possess another method for release of material: the formation of [[bacterial outer membrane vesicles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuehn MJ, Kesty NC | title = Bacterial outer membrane vesicles and the host-pathogen interaction | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 19 | issue = 22 | pages = 2645–55 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16291643 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1299905 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of the outer membrane pinch off, forming nano-scale spherical structures made of a lipopolysaccharide-rich lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials, and are deployed for [[membrane vesicle trafficking]] to manipulate environment or invade at [[host-pathogen interface]].  Vesicles from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain virulence factors, some have immunomodulatory effects, and some can directly adhere to and intoxicate host cells. release of vesicles has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions, the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McBroom AJ, Kuehn MJ | title = Release of outer membrane vesicles by Gram-negative bacteria is a novel envelope stress response | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 63 | issue = 2 | pages = 545–58 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17163978 | pmc = 1868505 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2006.05522.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4172">{{Semiotics}}
'''Semiotic literary criticism''', also called '''literary semiotics''', is the approach to [[literary criticism]] informed by the theory of signs or [[semiotics]]. Semiotics, tied closely to the [[structuralism]] pioneered by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], was extremely influential in the development of [[literary theory]] out of the formalist approaches of the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/S4B/sem11.html|title=Semiotics for Beginners: Criticisms|website=visual-memory.co.uk|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The early forms of literary semiotics grew out of formalist approaches to literature, especially [[Russian formalism]], and structuralist linguistics, especially the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague school]].  Notable early semiotic authors included [[Vladimir Propp]], [[Algirdas Julius Greimas]], and [[Viktor Shklovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ruc.udc.es/dspace/bitstream/handle/2183/13421/CC-130_art_129.pdf?sequence=1|title=Peirce’s Semiotics and the Russian Formalism: Points of Convergence|last=Kiryushchenko|first=Vitaly|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics were concerned with a formal analysis of narrative forms which would resemble a literary mathematics, or at least a literary [[syntax]], as far as possible.  They proposed various formal notations for narrative components and transformations and attempted a descriptive taxonomy of existing stories along these lines.

Propp's ''Morphology of the Folktale'' (orig. Russian pub. 1928; English trans. 1958) provides an example of the formal and systematic approach.  In successive chapters, Propp analyzes the characters, plot events, and other elements of traditional folktales (primarily from Russia and Eastern Europe).  For each of these key components he provides a letter designation (with superscripts to designate specific subtypes).  He proceeds to analyze individual tales by transposing them into this notation and then to generalize about their structure.  For example:

: Analysis of a simple, single-move tale of class H-I, of the type: kidnapping of a person.
:: 131. A tsar, three daughters (α).  The daughters go walking (β³), overstay in the garden (δ¹).  A dragon kidnaps them (A¹).  A call for aid (B¹).  Quest of three heroes (C↑).  Three battles with the dragon (H¹–I¹), rescue of the maidens (K&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;).  Return (↓), reward (w°). (Propp 128)

He then gives the complete structure of this story in one line of notation, the analysis complete and ready to be compared systematically with other tales:

::: αβ³δ¹A¹B¹C↑H¹–I¹K&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;↓w°

Later semiotic approaches to literature have often been less systematic (or, in some special cases such as [[Roland Barthes]]'s ''[[S/Z]]'', they have been so specifically and exhaustively systematic as to render the possibility of a complete literary semiotics doubtful).  As structuralist linguistics gave way to a [[post-structuralist]] philosophy of language which denied the scientific ambitions of the general theory of signs, semiotic literary criticism became more playful and less systematic in its ambitions.  Still, some authors harbor more scientific ambition for their literary schemata than others.  Later authors in the semiotic tradition of literary criticism include [[Tzvetan Todorov]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Michael Riffaterre]], and [[Umberto Eco]].

}}

The '''Stationers’ Register''' was a record book maintained by the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers' Company]] of London.  The company is a trade guild given a royal charter in 1557 to regulate the various professions associated with the publishing industry, including  printers, bookbinders, booksellers, and publishers in [[England]].  The Register itself allowed publishers to document their right to produce a particular printed work, and constituted an early form of [[copyright]] law.  The Company's charter gave it the right to seize illicit editions and bar the publication of unlicensed books.

For the study of English literature of the later sixteenth and the seventeenth centuries&amp;mdash;for the [[Elizabethan era]], the [[Jacobean era]], the [[Caroline era]], and especially for [[English Renaissance theatre]]&amp;mdash;the Stationers' Register is a crucial and essential resource: it provides factual information and hard data that is available nowhere else. Together with the records of the [[Master of the Revels]] (which relate to dramatic performance rather than publication), the Stationers' Register supplies many of the certain facts scholars possess on the works of [[William Shakespeare]], [[Ben Jonson]], and all of their immediate predecessors, contemporaries, and successors.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, ''Elizabethan Stage,'' Vol. 3, pp. 164-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

By paying a fee of 4 to 6 pence, a bookseller could register his right to publish a given work.  One example: the Stationers' Register reveals that on 26 November 1607, the stationers John Busby and [[Nathaniel Butter]] claimed the right to print "A booke called Master William Shakespeare his historye of Kinge Lear, as yt was played before the Kinges maiestie at Whitehall vppon Sainct Stephens night at Christmas Last, by his maiesties servantes playinge vsually at the Globe on the Banksyde." (They paid sixpence.)&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, ''Shakespeare Companion,'' pp. 265 and 474.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enforcement of regulations in this historical era was never as thorough as in the modern world; books were sometimes published without registration, and other irregularities also occurred. In some cases, the [[playing company|companies of actors]] appear to have registered plays through co-operative stationers, with the express purpose of forestalling the publication of a play when publication was not in their interest.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Much Ado About Nothing]],'' ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]],'' ''[[As You Like It]],'' and ''[[Every Man in His Humour]]'' were registered, apparently for such a purpose ("to be stayed"), on 4 August 1600. Yet if this interpretation is correct, the strategy to forestall publication had limited success; the first two plays were published later in 1600, and the last in 1601. Only ''As You Like It'' remained out of print at the time. Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 359; Halliday, pp. 216, 326.&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 1710, the Copyright Act or [[Statute of Anne]] entered into force, superseding company provisions pertaining to the Register.  The company continued to offer some form of registration of works until February 2000.

The '''Statue of Hope''' is an [[allegorical figure]] that is typically a private [[memorial]] or [[monument]] displayed in a [[graveyard]] or [[cemetery]]. [[Hope]] is one of the [[Seven Virtues]] of the [[Christian religion]].

==History==

Most commonly used in the [[Victorian era]] and believed to be popularized by the [[Statue of Liberty]]'s dedication in 1886. Prior to this, other images such as [[Saint Philomena]] whose authorization of devotion began in 1837 &lt;ref&gt;''It is Time to Meet St. Philomena'' By Dr. Mark Miravalle 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and Danish sculptor [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]]'s Goddess of Hope statue sculpted in 1817,&lt;ref&gt;''Kierkegaard and His Contemporaries'': Pages 375–405; Thorvaldsen: An Introduction to his Work 2003&lt;/ref&gt; displayed similar characteristics.

One of the earliest signed Statue of Hope memorials was carved by [[Odoardo Fantacchiotti]] in 1863 for the [[Grave (burial)|grave]] of Samuel Reginald Routh of [[England]] in the [[Protestant]] Cemetery of [[Florence]], Italy.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunders of White Silence, the Protestant cemetery of Florence, Italy'', Julia Bolton Holloway 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Another variation was completed in 1791. The [[Custom House, Dublin]] [[Ireland]] features a 16 foot (about 5 meter) tall statue of a female resting on an anchor atop the dome. This statue has been called both the Statue of Hope&lt;ref&gt;"The Catholic World", The Catholic Publication House, New York, Page 831, Vol. XIX April–September 1874&lt;/ref&gt; and the Statue of Commerce.&lt;ref&gt;"The Encyclopædia Britannica", The Sixth Edition, Page 367, Vol. VII, 1823&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==

In the [[United States]], these statues were commonly carved out of limestone or [[marble]] and were usually unsigned. The Wilson memorial pictured on the right was sculpted using [[Indiana Limestone]] which was quarried nearby. Towards the latter part of the 19th and early 20th century, some were cast with [[zinc]], commonly referred to as [[White Bronze]].&lt;ref&gt;The Foundry Magazine, Vol.35 No. 5, January 1910, Cleveland, Ohio&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious symbolism==

A female, typically shown wearing [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Stola]] and [[Palla (garment)|Palla]] garments, stands with one arm resting on or holding an [[anchor]]. This is often an [[Anchored cross]] meaning hope&lt;ref&gt;Keister, Douglas, ''Stories in Stone: A Field Guide to Cemetery Symbolism and Iconography''. Layton, UT: Gibbs Smith Publishers, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and is the primary symbol of the statue. Further, the [[New Testament]], Hebrews 6:19 states ''Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and which entereth into that within the veil.''&lt;ref&gt;Smith, William and Cheetam, Samuel, ''A Dictionary of Christian Antiquities'', London, England: J. R Burr Publishing Co., Page 81, Vol.1, 1880&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the opposite arm is raised with the index finger of the hand pointing towards the sky. This symbolizes the pathway to heaven. A hand held over the heart symbolizes faith. Other key elements can be a broken chain attached to the anchor or sometimes hanging from the neck. This symbolizes the cessation of life. Many statues have a single [[five pointed star]] rather than a [[circle of stars]]. The [[Star (heraldry)|star]] is on the top of the forehead, usually on a [[Crown of Immortality]] or [[diadem]], and represents the immortal [[soul]].&lt;ref&gt;''Memorial Art, Ancient and Modern'', Harry A Bliss 1912&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''system context diagram''' (SCD) in [[engineering]] is a [[diagram]] that defines the boundary between the [[system]], or part of a system, and its environment, showing the entities that interact with it.&lt;ref&gt;Manoj Kumar Choubey (2012) ''IT Infrastructure and Management (For the GBTU and MMTU)''. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; This diagram is a high level view of a [[system]]. It is similar to a [[block diagram]].

== Overview == 
System context diagrams show a system, as a whole and its [[Input/output|input]]s and [[Output (computing)|output]]s from/to external factors. According to Kossiakoff and Sweet (2011):&lt;ref name="KoSw03"&gt;Alexander Kossiakoff, William N. Sweet (2011). ''Systems Engineering: Principles and Practices'' p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{Quote|System Context Diagrams&amp;nbsp;... represent all external entities that may interact with a system&amp;nbsp;... Such a diagram pictures the system at the center, with no details of its interior structure, surrounded by all its interacting systems, environments and activities. The objective of the system context diagram is to focus attention on external factors and events that should be considered in developing a complete set of systems requirements and constraints.}}

System context diagrams are used early in a project to get agreement on the scope under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Wiener (1998) ''Journal of Object-oriented Programming''. Vol 11. p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Context diagrams are typically included in a requirements document. These diagrams must be read by all project stakeholders and thus should be written in plain language, so the stakeholders can understand items within the document.

== Building blocks ==
Context diagrams can be developed with the use of two types of building blocks:
* ''Entities (Actors)'': labeled boxes; one in the center representing the system, and around it multiple boxes for each external actor
* ''Relationships'': labeled lines between the entities and system

For example, "customer places order." Context diagrams can also use many different drawing types to represent external entities. They can use [[Oval (geometry)|oval]]s, [[stick figure]]s, [[picture]]s, [[clip art]] or any other representation to convey meaning. Decision trees and data storage are represented in system flow diagrams.

A context diagram can also list the classifications of the external entities as one of a set of simple categories&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Robertson, James C. Robertson (2006) ''Mastering the Requirements Process''. Pearson Education, 17 mrt. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (Examples:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/81429/RESCUE_i_SD_tutorial.pdf System Goal Modelling using the i*: Approach in RESCUE] Centre HCI Design, 27 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;), which add clarity to the level of involvement of the entity with regards to the system. These categories include:
* ''Active'': Dynamic to achieve some goal or purpose (Examples: "Article readers" or "customers").
* ''Passive'': Static external entities which infrequently interact with the system (Examples: "Article editors" or "database administrator").
* ''Cooperative'': Predictable external entities which are used by the system to bring about some desired outcome (Examples: "Internet service providers" or "shipping companies").
* ''Autonomous (Independent)'': External entities which are separated from the system, but affect the system indirectly, by means of imposed constraints or similar influences (Examples: "regulatory committees" or "standards groups").

== Alternatives ==
The best system context diagrams are used to display how a system interoperates at a very high level, or how systems operate and interact logically. The system context diagram is a necessary tool in developing a baseline interaction between systems and actors; actors and a system or systems and systems. Alternatives to the system context diagram are:

[[File:Greater Yellowstone Rural ITS Architecture Interconnect Diagram.jpg|thumb|360px|Example of an Architecture Interconnect Diagram.&lt;ref name="USDT06"/&gt;]]
* ''Architecture Interconnect Diagram'': The figure gives an example of an Architecture Interconnect Diagram: A representation of the Albuquerque regional ITS architecture interconnects for the Albuquerque Police Department that was generated using the Turbo Architecture tool is shown in the figure. Each block represents an ITS inventory element, including the name of the stakeholder in the top shaded portion. The interconnect lines between elements are solid or dashed, indicating existing or planned connections.&lt;ref name="USDT06"/&gt;
* ''[[Business Model Canvas]]'', a strategic management template for developing new or documenting existing business models. It is a visual chart with elements describing a firm's value proposition, infrastructure, customers, and finances.[1] It assists firms in aligning their activities by illustrating potential trade-offs.
* ''[[Enterprise data model]]'': this type of [[data model]] according to Simsion (2005) can contain up to 50 to 200 entity classes, which results from specific "high level of generalization in [[data modeling]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Graeme Simsion|Graeme C. Simsion]], Graham C. Witt (2005). ''Data Modeling Essentials''. p. 512.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''IDEF0 Top Level Context Diagram'': The [[IDEF0]] process starts with the identification of the prime function to be decomposed. This function is identified on a "Top Level Context Diagram" that defines the scope of the particular IDEF0 analysis.
* ''[[Problem Frames Approach#Problem diagrams|Problem Diagrams (Problem Frames)]]'': In addition to the kinds of things shown on a context diagram, a problem diagram shows requirements and requirements references.
* ''[[Use case diagram]]'': One of the [[Unified Modeling Language]] diagrams. They also represent the scope of the project at a similar level of abstraction. - Use Cases, however, tend to focus more on the goals of 'actors' who interact with the system, and do not specify any solution. Use Case diagrams represent a set of Use Cases, which are textual descriptions of how an actor achieves the goal of a use case. for Example Customer Places Order.

Most of these diagrams work well as long as a limited number of interconnects will be shown. Where twenty or more interconnects must be displayed, the diagrams become quite complex and can be difficult to read.&lt;ref name="USDT06"&gt;US Department of Transportation, Office of Operations (2006)[http://ops.fhwa.dot.gov/publications/regitsarchguide/5defineint.htm Regional ITS Architecture Guidance Document]. July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''triangle of auscultation of the lungs''' is a relative thinning of the musculature of the back, situated along the medial border of the [[scapula]].

== Boundaries ==
It has the following boundaries:

* Superiorly and medially, by the inferior portion of the trapezius
* Inferiorly, by the [[latissimus dorsi]]
* Laterally, by the medial border of the scapula

The superficial floor of the triangle is formed by the lateral portion of the [[erector spinae]] muscles. Deep to these muscles are the osseous portions of the  6th and 7th ribs and the internal and external intercostal muscles.

==Function==
Due to the relative thinning of the musculature of the back in the triangle, the posterior thoracic wall is closer to the skin surface, making respiratory sounds able to be heard more clearly with a stethoscope.

Typically, the triangle of auscultation is covered by the [[scapula]]. To better expose the floor of the triangle up of the posterior thoracic wall in the 6th and 7th intercostal space, a patient is asked to fold their arms across their chest, laterally rotating the scapulae, while bending forward at the trunk, somewhat resembling a fetal position.

On the left side, the cardiac orifice of the stomach lies deep to the triangle, and in days before X-rays were discovered the sound of swallowed liquids were auscultated over this triangle to confirm an oesophageal tumour

'''Type-2 fuzzy sets and systems''' generalize standard '''[[fuzzy sets|Type-1 fuzzy sets]] and [[fuzzy sets and systems|systems]]''' so that more uncertainty can be handled. From the very beginning of fuzzy sets, criticism was made about the fact that the membership function of a type-1 fuzzy set has no uncertainty associated with it, something that seems to contradict the word ''fuzzy'', since that word has the connotation of lots of uncertainty. So, what does one do when there is uncertainty about the value of the membership function? The answer to this question was provided in 1975 by the inventor of fuzzy sets, Prof. [[Lotfi A. Zadeh]]&lt;ref name="[27]"&gt;L. A. Zadeh, "The Concept of a Linguistic Variable and Its Application to Approximate Reasoning–1," ''Information Sciences'', vol. 8, pp.&amp;nbsp;199–249, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;, when he proposed more sophisticated kinds of fuzzy sets, the first of which he called a '''''type-2 fuzzy set'''''. A type-2 fuzzy set lets us incorporate uncertainty about the membership function into fuzzy set theory, and is a way to address the above criticism of type-1 fuzzy sets head-on. And, if there is no uncertainty, then a type-2 fuzzy set reduces to a type-1 fuzzy set, which is analogous to probability reducing to determinism when unpredictability vanishes.

In order to symbolically distinguish between a type-1 fuzzy set and a type-2 fuzzy set, a tilde symbol is put over the symbol for the fuzzy set; so, A denotes a type-1 fuzzy set, whereas Ã denotes the comparable type-2 fuzzy set. When the latter is done, the resulting type-2 fuzzy set is called a '''''general type-2 fuzzy set''''' (to distinguish it from the special interval type-2 fuzzy set).

Prof. Zadeh didn't stop with type-2 fuzzy sets, because in that 1976 paper&lt;ref name="[27]" /&gt; he also generalized all of this to type-''n'' fuzzy sets. The present article focuses only on type-2 fuzzy sets because they are the ''next step'' in the logical progression from type-1 to type-''n'' fuzzy sets, where ''n'' = 1, 2, … . Although some researchers are beginning to explore higher than type-2 fuzzy sets, as of early 2009, this work is in its infancy.

[[Image:MF of general T2 FS.jpg|right|thumb|Figure 1. The membership function of a general type-2 fuzzy set is three-dimensional. A cross-section of one slice of the third dimension is shown. This cross-section, as well as all others, sits on the FOU. Only the boundary of the cross-section is used to describe the membership function of a general type-2 fuzzy set. It is shown filled-in for artistic purposes.]]
The membership function of a general type-2 fuzzy set, Ã, is three-dimensional (Fig. 1), where the third dimension is the value of the membership function at each point on its two-dimensional domain that is called its '''''footprint of uncertainty''''' (FOU).

For an interval type-2 fuzzy set that third-dimension value is the same (e.g., 1) everywhere, which means that no new information is contained in the third dimension of an interval type-2 fuzzy set. So, for such a set, the third dimension is ignored, and only the FOU is used to describe it. It is for this reason that an interval type-2 fuzzy set is sometimes called a ''first-order uncertainty'' fuzzy set model, whereas a general type-2 fuzzy set (with its useful third-dimension) is sometimes referred to as a ''second-order uncertainty'' fuzzy set model.

[[Image:FOU for IT2 FS.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 2. FOU for an interval type-2 fuzzy set. Many other shapes are possible for the FOU.]]
The FOU represents the blurring of a type-1 membership function, and is completely described by its two bounding functions (Fig. 2), a lower membership function (LMF) and an upper membership function (UMF), both of which are type-1 fuzzy sets! Consequently, it is possible to use type-1 fuzzy set mathematics to characterize and work with interval type-2 fuzzy sets. This means that engineers and scientists who already know type-1 fuzzy sets will not have to invest a lot of time learning about general type-2 fuzzy set mathematics in order to understand and use interval type-2 fuzzy sets.

Work on type-2 fuzzy sets languished during the 1980s and early-to-mid 1990's, although a small number of articles were published about them. People were still trying to figure out what to do with type-1 fuzzy sets, so even though Zadeh proposed type-2 fuzzy sets in 1976, the time was not right for researchers to drop what they were doing with type-1 fuzzy sets to focus on type-2 fuzzy sets. This changed in the latter part of the 1990s as a result of Prof. Jerry Mendel and his student's works on type-2 fuzzy sets and systems.&lt;ref name="[12]"&gt;J. M. Mendel, ''Uncertain Rule-Based Fuzzy Logic Systems: Introduction and New Directions'', Prentice-Hall, Upper-Saddle River, NJ, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, more and more researchers around the world are writing articles about type-2 fuzzy sets and systems.

==Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets==
Interval type-2 fuzzy sets have received the most attention because the mathematics that is needed for such sets—primarily [[Interval arithmetic]]—is much simpler than the mathematics that is needed for general type-2 fuzzy sets. So, the literature about interval type-2 fuzzy sets is large, whereas the literature about general type-2 fuzzy sets is much smaller. Both kinds of fuzzy sets are being actively researched by an ever-growing number of researchers around the world and have resulted in successful employment in variety of domains such as robot control.&lt;ref name=hassanzadeh&gt;Hassanzadeh, Hamid Reza, et al. "An interval-valued fuzzy controller for complex dynamical systems with application to a 3-PSP parallel robot." Fuzzy sets and systems 235 (2014): 83-100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Logic Systems==
Type-2 fuzzy sets are finding very wide applicability in '''''rule-based fuzzy logic systems''''' (FLSs) because they let uncertainties be modeled by them whereas such uncertainties cannot be modeled by type-1 fuzzy sets. A block diagram of a type-2 FLS is depicted in Fig. 3. This kind of FLS is used in fuzzy logic control, fuzzy logic signal processing, rule-based classification, etc., and is sometimes referred to as a ''function approximation'' application of fuzzy sets, because the FLS is designed to minimize an error function.

[[Image:T2 FLS.jpg|thumb|left|Figure 3. Type-2 FLS]]

The following discussions, about the four components in the Fig. 3 rule-based FLS, are given for an interval type-2 FLS, because to-date they are the most popular kind of type-2 FLS; however, most of the discussions are also applicable for a general type-2 FLS.

'''''Rules''''', that are either provided by subject experts or are extracted from numerical data, are expressed as a collection of IF-THEN statements, e.g.,

:IF temperature is ''moderate'' and pressure is ''high'', then rotate the valve ''a bit to the right''.

Fuzzy sets are associated with the terms that appear in the antecedents (IF-part) or consequents (THEN-part) of rules, and with the inputs to and the outputs of the FLS. Membership functions are used to describe these fuzzy sets, and in a type-1 FLS they are all type-1 fuzzy sets, whereas in an interval type-2 FLS at least one membership function is an interval type-2 fuzzy set.

An interval type-2 FLS lets any one or all of the following kinds of uncertainties be quantified:

# Words that are used in antecedents and consequents of rules—because words can mean different things to different people.
# Uncertain consequents—because when rules are obtained from a group of experts, consequents will often be different for the same rule, i.e. the experts will not necessarily be in agreement.
# Membership function parameters—because when those parameters are optimized using uncertain (noisy) training data, the parameters become uncertain.
# Noisy measurements—because very often it is such measurements that activate the FLS.

In Fig. 3, measured (crisp) inputs are first transformed into fuzzy sets in the '''''Fuzzifier''''' block because it is fuzzy sets and not numbers that activate the rules which are described in terms of fuzzy sets and not numbers. Three kinds of fuzzifiers are possible in an interval type-2 FLS. When measurements are:
* Perfect, they are modeled as a crisp set;  
* Noisy, but the noise is stationary, they are modeled as a type-1 fuzzy set; and,
* Noisy, but the noise is non-stationary, they are modeled as an interval type-2 fuzzy set (this latter kind of fuzzification cannot be done in a type-1 FLS).

In Fig. 3, after measurements are fuzzified, the resulting input fuzzy sets are mapped into fuzzy output sets by the '''''Inference''''' block. This is accomplished by first quantifying each rule using fuzzy set theory, and by then using the mathematics of fuzzy sets to establish the output of each rule, with the help of an inference mechanism. If there are ''M'' rules then the fuzzy input sets to the Inference block will activate only a subset of those rules, where the subset contains at least one rule and usually way fewer than ''M'' rules. Inference is done one rule at a time. So, at the output of the Inference block, there will be one or more ''fired-rule fuzzy output sets''.

In most engineering applications of a FLS, a number (and not a fuzzy set) is needed as its final output, e.g., the consequent of the rule given above is "Rotate the valve a bit to the right." No automatic valve will know what this means because "a bit to the right" is a linguistic expression, and a valve must be turned by numerical values, i.e. by a certain number of degrees. Consequently, the fired-rule output fuzzy sets have to be converted into a number, and this is done in the Fig. 3 '''''Output Processing''''' block.

In a type-1 FLS, output processing, called '''''[[Defuzzification]]''''', maps a type-1 fuzzy set into a number. There are many ways for doing this, e.g., compute the union of the fired-rule output fuzzy sets (the result is another type-1 fuzzy set) and then compute the center of gravity of the membership function for that set; compute a weighted average of the center of gravities of each of the fired rule consequent membership functions; etc.

Things are somewhat more complicated for an interval type-2 FLS, because to go from an interval type-2 fuzzy set to a number (usually) requires two steps (Fig. 3). The first step, called '''''type-reduction''''', is where an interval type-2 fuzzy set is reduced to an interval-valued type-1 fuzzy set. There are as many type-reduction methods as there are type-1 defuzzification methods. An algorithm developed by Karnik and Mendel&lt;ref name="[7]" /&gt;&lt;ref name="[12]" /&gt; now known as the '''''KM Algorithm''''' is used for type-reduction. Although this algorithm is iterative, it is very fast.

The second step of Output Processing, which occurs after type-reduction, is still called '''''defuzzification'''''. Because a type-reduced set of an interval type-2 fuzzy set is always a finite interval of numbers, the defuzzified value is just the average of the two end-points of this interval.

It is clear from Fig. 3 that there can be two outputs to an interval type-2 FLS—crisp numerical values and the type-reduced set. The latter provides a measure of the uncertainties that have flowed through the interval type-2 FLS, due to the (possibly) uncertain input measurements that have activated rules whose antecedents or consequents or both are uncertain. Just as standard deviation is widely used in probability and statistics to provide a measure of unpredictable uncertainty about a mean value, the type-reduced set can provided a measure of uncertainty about the crisp output of an interval type-2 FLS.

==Computing with words==
Another application for fuzzy sets has also been inspired by Prof. Zadeh&lt;ref name="[28]"&gt;L. A. Zadeh, "Fuzzy logic = computing with words," ''IEEE Trans. on Fuzzy Systems'', vol. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;103–111, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="[29]"&gt;L. A. Zadeh, "From computing with numbers to computing with words—from manipulation of measurements to manipulation of perceptions," ''IEEE Trans. on Circuits and Systems–1, Fundamental Theory and Applications'', vol. 4, pp.&amp;nbsp;105–119, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="[30]"&gt;L. A. Zadeh, "Toward human level machine intelligence—is it achievable? The need for a new paradigm shift," ''IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine'', vol. 3, pp.&amp;nbsp;11–22, August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; — '''''Computing With Words'''''. Different acronyms have been used for "computing with words," e.g., CW and CWW. According to Zadeh:
:CWW is a methodology in which the objects of computation are words and propositions drawn from a natural language. [It is] inspired by the remarkable human capability to perform a wide variety of physical and mental tasks without any measurements and any computations. 
Of course, he did not mean that computers would actually compute using words—single words or phrases—rather than numbers. He meant that computers would be activated by words, which would be converted into a mathematical representation using fuzzy sets and that these fuzzy sets would be mapped by a CWW engine into some other fuzzy set after which the latter would be converted back into a word. A natural question to ask is: Which kind of fuzzy set—type-1 or type-2—should be used as a model for a word? Mendel&lt;ref name="[13]"&gt;J. M. Mendel, "Fuzzy Sets for Words: a New Beginning," ''Proc. IEEE FUZZ Conference'', St. Louis, MO, May 26–28, 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;37–42.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="[16]"&gt;J. M. Mendel, "Computing with words: Zadeh, Turing, Popper and Occam," ''IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine'', vol. 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;10–17, November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; has argued, on the basis of [[Karl Popper]]'s concept of '''''[[Falsificationism]]''''',&lt;ref name="[19]"&gt;K. Popper, ''The Logic of Scientific Discovery'' (translation of Logik der Forschung), Hutchinson, London, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="[30]" /&gt; that using a type-1 fuzzy set as a model for a word is scientifically incorrect. An interval type-2 fuzzy set should be used as a (first-order uncertainty) model for a word. Much research is under way about CWW.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="917">'''Urediniospores''' (or '''uredospores''') are thin-walled [[spore]]s produced by the [[uredium]], a stage in the life-cycle of [[Rust (fungus)|rusts]].

==Development==
''Urediniospores'' develop in the [[uredium]], generally on a leaf's under surface.

==Morphology==
*Urediniospores usually have two [[Dikaryon|dikaryote]] nuclei within one cell. In mass they are usually pale brown in contrast to [[teliospore]]s which are generally dark brown.
