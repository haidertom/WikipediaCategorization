      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2839">Between 2009 and 2012, '''Agriculture and Rural Development Day''' ('''ARDD''') was an annual event co-organized by the [[CGIAR|Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]] (CGIAR), [[Earth System Science Partnership]] (ESSP), [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), [[Global Forum on Agricultural Research]] (GFAR), [[International Federation of Agricultural Producers]] (IFAP), and [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI).

== History ==
The first event took place as a side event at the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP15) in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agricultureday.org/ARDDay2009/|title=Agriculture and Rural Development Day 2009 Website|website=www.agricultureday.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second event took place as a side event at the [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP15) in [[Cancún]], [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agricultureday.org/ardday2010/|title=Agriculture and Rural Development Day 2010|website=www.agricultureday.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third event took place as a side event at the [[2011 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP15) in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.agricultureday.org/ardday2011/|title=Agriculture and Rural Development Day 2011|website=www.agricultureday.org|access-date=2017-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth event took place at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (UNCSD)—also called Rio 2012, Rio+20, or the Earth Summit 2012—in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]]. It was co-hosted by the [[Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation]] (Embrapa) and the CGIAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cgiar.org/consortium-events/2012/06/18/agriculture-and-rural-development-day/|title=Agriculture and Rural Development Day|work=CGIAR|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fifth and final ARDD, called Agriculture, Landscapes, and Livelihoods Day 5&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agricultureday.org/about/index.html Agriculture, Landscapes, and Livelihoods Day 5]&lt;/ref&gt;(ALL-5), took place alongside Forest Day on the sidelines of the [[2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] (COP18) in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://wle.cgiar.org/thrive/2012/12/05/story-agriculture-and-climate-change-road-we%E2%80%99ve-travelled|title=The Story of Agriculture and Climate Change: The Road We’ve Travelled|date=2012-12-05|work=Water, Land and Ecosystems|access-date=2017-12-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, this event merged with [[Forest Day]] to become the [[Global Landscapes Forum]] (GLF).

}}

'''Alfred Mann''' (April 28, 1917 – September 21, 2006), was a writer in [[musical theory]] and Professor of [[Musicology]]&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; at the [[Eastman School of Music]], [[University of Rochester]].

==Biography==

Alfred Mann left Germany before [[World War II]] and moved to Italy where he only could stay shortly. In 1938, Mann had to leave Italy, because of a [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] mandate, and Mann moved to the USA. After a long career, Mann became Professor of Musicology at the Eastman School in 1980, retiring and becoming [[Professor Emeritus]] in 1987.

==Important Writings==

In 1943, Mann made the first translation&lt;ref name="gradus" /&gt; of [[Johann Joseph Fux]]'s ''[[Gradus ad Parnassum]]'' into English. The translation contained the preface, pages 41 – 139 and page 279 of the original work.

In 1958, Mann translated&lt;ref name="fugue1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fugue2" /&gt; into English, the part of ''Gradus ad Parnassum'' that concerned the composition of a [[fugue]], pages 140 – 217 of the original work.

With ports to allow sunlight in, nutrients (the waste and urine) were introduced via some overflow mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Algatron|url=http://www.worldoftrons.com/blog/2017/2/21/algatron|website=World of Trons|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the promise that the Algatron represented, and the ways in which Oswald and Golueke "understood that the closed environment of the space capsule was itself just the a microcosm of the closed system of the earth's biosphere," the technology would never get past the prototype stage. NASA instead decided to go with fecal bags to deal with waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Munns|first1=David|title=Engineering the Environment: Phytotrons and the Quest for Climate Control in the Cold War|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|pages=248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russians developed a similar system, the BIOS-3, which got as far enough as a successful test run with human occupants in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;ibid,. xx&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6541">{{Anthropology}}

The '''anthropology of institutions''' is a sub-field in [[social anthropology]] dedicated to the study of [[institution]]s in different cultural contexts.

The role of anthropology in institutions has expanded significantly since the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Companion to Organizational Anthropology|last=Douglas|first=Caulkins|publisher=Wiley|year=2012|isbn=|location=Hoboken, N.J.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Much of this development can be attributed to the rise in anthropologists working outside of academia and the increasing importance of [[globalization]] in both institutions and the [[Anthropology|field of anthropology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Anthropologists can be employed by institutions such as [[Business|for-profit business]], [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit organizations]], and [[Government|governments]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  For instance, [[Cultural anthropology|cultural anthropologists]] are commonly employed by the [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal government]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The two types of institutions defined in the field of anthropology are [[total institution]]s and social institutions.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0156.xml#firstMatch|title=Institutions|last=Hejtmanek|first=Katie Rose|date=28 November 2016|website=Oxford Bibliographies|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Total institutions are places that comprehensively coordinate the actions of people within them, and examples of total institutions include [[Prison|prisons]], [[Convent|convents]], and [[Hospital|hospitals]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Social institutions, on the other hand, are constructs that regulate individuals’ day-to-day lives, such as [[kinship]], [[religion]], and [[economics]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Anthropology of institutions may analyze [[Trade union|labor unions]], businesses ranging from [[Small business|small enterprises]] to [[Corporation|corporations]], government, medical organizations,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[education]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Magolda|first=Peter M.|date=March 2000|title=The Campus Tour: Ritual and Community in Higher Education|url=|journal=Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|volume=31|pages=24–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; prisons,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cunha|first=Manuela|date=2014|title=The Ethnography of Prisons and Penal Confinement|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=43|pages=217–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rhodes|first=Lorna A.|date=2001|title=Toward an Anthropology of Prisons|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=30|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Financial institution|financial institutions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ho|first=Karen|date=2009|title=Liquidated: An Ethnography of Wall Street|url=|journal=Contemporary Sociology: A Journal of Reviews|volume=41|pages=739–747}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Non-governmental organization|Nongovernmental organizations]] have garnered particular interest in the field of institutional anthropology because they are capable of fulfilling roles previously ignored by governments,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=William F.|date=|title=1997|url=|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|volume=26|pages=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; or previously realized by families or local groups, in an attempt to mitigate [[Social issue|social problems]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The types and methods of scholarship performed in the anthropology of institutions can take a number of forms.  Institutional anthropologists may study the relationship between organizations or between an organization and other parts of society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Institutional anthropology may also focus on the inner workings of an institution, such as the relationships, [[Hierarchy|hierarchies]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;and cultures formed,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the ways that these elements are transmitted and maintained, transformed, or abandoned over time.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Institutional Ethnography as Practice|last=Smith|first=Dorothy E.|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=|location=Lanham, Maryland|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, some anthropology of institutions examines the specific design of institutions and their corresponding strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levitsky|first=Steven|last2=Murillo|first2=Maria|date=2009|title=Variation in Institutional Strength|url=|journal=Annual Review of Political Science|volume=12|pages=115–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More specifically, anthropologists may analyze specific events within an institution, perform [[Semiotics|semiotic]] investigations, or analyze the mechanisms by which [[knowledge]] and [[culture]] are organized and dispersed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In all manifestations of institutional anthropology, participant [[observation]] is critical to understanding the intricacies of the way an institution works and the consequences of actions taken by individuals within it.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Verlot|first=Marc|date=2001|title=Are politics human? Problems and challenges of institutional anthropology|url=|journal=Social Anthropology|volume=9|pages=345–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Simultaneously, anthropology of institutions extends beyond examination of the commonplace involvement of individuals in institutions to discover how and why the organizational principles evolved in the manner that they did.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Common considerations taken by anthropologists in studying institutions include the physical location at which a researcher places themselves, as important interactions often take place in private, and the fact that the members of an institution are often being examined in their workplace and may not have much idle time to discuss the details of their everyday endeavors.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Network Inside Out|last=Riles|first=Annelise|publisher=The University of Michigan Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ability of individuals to present the workings of an institution in a particular light or frame must additionally be taken into account when using [[Interview|interviews]] and [[Documentary analysis|document analysis]] to understand an institution,&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; as the involvement of an anthropologist may be met with [[distrust]] when information being released to the public isn’t directly controlled by the institution and could potentially be damaging.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The '''Association for Heritage Interpretation''' (AHI) is a membership based organisation for people actively involved or concerned with [[heritage interpretation]].

AHI began as the '''Society for the Interpretation of Britain’s Heritage''' in 1975 and later became the Association for Heritage Interpretation. It has a membership of over 400 interpreters from around the world. It is managed by an Executive Committee which meets four times a year and holds an AGM at the Annual Conference in the Autumn.&lt;ref name=whatis /&gt; AHI’s president was [[John Edmondson, 2nd Baron Sandford|Lord Sandford]] (1920-2009){{cn|date=November 2016}} and its patron is Loyd Grossman.&lt;ref name=awards /&gt;

The Association states&lt;ref name=whatis&gt;{{cite web|title=What is AHI?|url=http://www.ahi.org.uk/www/about/what_is_ahi/|publisher=Association for Heritage Interpretation|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it:
{{quote| ... works to:

* Encourage excellence in interpretation 
* Promote professionalism in interpretation 
* Facilitate discussion and exchange of ideas 
* Support a wide range of organisations in their service to visitors 
* Develop and recognise best practice }}

AHI offers a focus for ideas, debate and networking. The association brings together people actively involved or concerned with interpretation of natural and cultural heritage. Some work as interpretation or heritage officers, park rangers or countryside managers, others as designers or illustrators, planners, teachers, curators, consultants, academics or people from many other professions with an interest in our environmental inheritance.

AHI publishes its journal ''Interpretation'' three times year, produces bi-monthly newsletters and organises a series of training events each year. In 2007, AHI worked with [[Interpret Scotland]] to hold [[The Vital Spark Interpretation Conference]] in Aviemore. The vibrant annual AHI conference is hosted in different venues across Britain and brings together interpreters to meet each other, present papers on interpretation practice and visit local visitor sites to see case studies of interpretation. Recent hosts have included Bournemouth, Cardiff, Newcastle and Shropshire. The 2013 conference is in Edinburgh in October.

==Awards==
The AHI offered '''Discover Heritage Awards''' in 2015 and 2017.&lt;ref name=awards&gt;{{cite web|title=Discover Heritage Awards|url=http://www.ahi.org.uk/www/awards/|publisher=Association for Heritage Interpretation|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1984 to 2007 the '''Interpret Britain and Ireland Awards''' were awarded annually, "recognising innovative and inspiring interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Past Awards|url=http://www.ahi.org.uk/www/awards/view_details/4/|publisher=Association for Heritage Interpretation|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15497">'''Attribute substitution''', also known as '''Substitution bias''', is a psychological process thought to underlie a number of [[cognitive bias]]es and [[optical illusion|perceptual illusions]]. It occurs when an individual has to make a judgment (of a ''target attribute'') that is computationally complex, and instead substitutes a more easily calculated ''[[heuristics in judgment and decision making|heuristic]] attribute''.&lt;ref name="newell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Newell |first=Benjamin R. |first2=David A. |last2=Lagnado |first3=David R. |last3=Shanks  |title=Straight choices: the psychology of decision making |publisher=Routledge |year=2007 |pages=71–74 |isbn=978-1-84169-588-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This substitution is thought of as taking place in the automatic ''intuitive'' judgment system, rather than the more self-aware ''reflective'' system. Hence, when someone tries to answer a difficult question, they may actually answer a related but different question, without realizing that a substitution has taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Associative processes in intuitive judgment|url = http://www.cell.com/article/S1364661310001713/abstract|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date = 2010-01-10|issn = 1364-6613|pmid = 20696611|pages = 435–440|volume = 14|issue = 10|doi = 10.1016/j.tics.2010.07.004|language = English|first = Carey K.|last = Morewedge|first2 = Daniel|last2 = Kahneman|pmc = 5378157}}&lt;/ref&gt; This explains why individuals can be unaware of their own biases, and why biases persist even when the subject is made aware of them. It also explains why human judgments often fail to show [[regression toward the mean]].&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;

The theory of attribute substitution unifies a number of separate explanations of reasoning errors in terms of [[heuristics in judgment and decision making|cognitive heuristics]].&lt;ref name="newell"/&gt; In turn, the theory is subsumed by an ''effort-reduction framework'' proposed by Anuj K. Shah and [[Daniel M. Oppenheimer]], which states that people use a variety of techniques to reduce the effort of making decisions.&lt;ref name="shah2008"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Daniel KAHNEMAN.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Kahneman]]]]
In a 1974 paper, psychologists [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] argued that a broad family of biases (systematic errors in judgment and decision) were explainable in terms of a few heuristics (information-processing shortcuts), including [[availability heuristic|availability]] and [[representativeness heuristic|representativeness]]. In a 2002 revision of the theory, Kahneman and [[Shane Frederick]] proposed attribute substitution as a process underlying these and other effects.&lt;ref name="revisited"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kahneman |first=Daniel |first2=Shane |last2=Frederick  |title=Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment |editor=Thomas Gilovich |editor2=Dale Griffin |editor3=Daniel Kahneman |publisher =Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=2002 |pages=49–81 |chapter=Representativeness Revisited: Attribute Substitution in Intuitive Judgment |isbn=978-0-521-79679-8 |oclc=47364085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, psychologist [[Stanley Smith Stevens]] proposed that the strength of a stimulus (e.g., the brightness of a light, the severity of a crime) is encoded neurally in a way that is independent of [[stimulus modality|modality]]. Kahneman and Frederick built on this idea, arguing that the target attribute and heuristic attribute could be unrelated.&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;

== Conditions ==
{{Quote box |quote=[P]eople are not accustomed to thinking hard, and are often content to trust a plausible judgment that comes to mind. |source=[[Daniel Kahneman]], ''American Economic Review'' '''93''' (5) December 2003, p. 1450 |width=30% |align=right}}
Kahneman and Frederick propose three conditions for attribute substitution:&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;
# The target attribute is relatively inaccessible. Substitution is not expected to take place in answering factual questions that can be retrieved directly from memory ("What is your birthday?") or about current experience ("Do you feel thirsty now?).
# An associated attribute is highly accessible. This might be because it is evaluated automatically in normal perception or because it has been [[priming (psychology)|primed]]. For example, someone who has been thinking about their love life who is then asked about their happiness might substitute how happy they are with their love life rather than answer the question as asked.
# The substitution is not detected and corrected by the reflective system. For example, when asked "A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?" many subjects incorrectly answer $0.10.&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |date=December 2003 |title=Maps of Bounded Rationality: Psychology for Behavioral Economics |journal= American Economic Review |publisher=American Economic Association |volume=93 |issue=5 |pages=1449–1475 |doi=10.1257/000282803322655392 |issn=0002-8282}}&lt;/ref&gt; An explanation in terms of attribute substitution is that, rather than work out the sum, subjects parse the sum of $1.10 into a large amount and a small amount, which is easy to do. Whether they feel that is the right answer will depend on whether they check the calculation with their reflective system.

==Examples==
[[File:Opt taeuschung groesse.jpg|thumb|225px|right|This illusion works because 3D (perspective) size is substituted for 2D size (all pairs are equal in size)]]

===Optical illusions===
Attribute substitution explains the persistence of some illusions. For example, when subjects judge the size of two figures in a [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]] picture, their apparent sizes can be distorted by the 3D context, making a convincing optical illusion. The theory states that the three-dimensional size of the figure (which is accessible because it is automatically computed by the visual system) is substituted for its two-dimensional size on the page. Experienced painters and photographers are less susceptible to this illusion, because the two-dimensional size is more accessible to their perception.&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"/&gt;

===Valuing insurance===
Kahneman gives an example where some Americans were offered [[insurance]] against their own death in a terrorist attack while on a trip to Europe, while another group were offered insurance that would cover death of any kind on the trip. The former group were willing to pay more even though "death of any kind" includes "death in a terrorist attack", Kahneman suggests that the attribute of [[fear]] is being substituted for a calculation of the total risks of travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/kahneman07/kahneman07_index.html |title=Short Course in Thinking About Thinking |last= Kahneman |first=Daniel |year=2007 |work=Edge.org |publisher=Edge Foundation |accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of terrorism for these subjects was stronger than a general fear of dying on a foreign trip.

===Stereotypes===
[[Stereotypes]] can be a source of heuristic attributes.&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt; In a face-to-face conversation with a stranger, judging their intelligence is more computationally complex than judging the colour of their skin. So if the subject has a [[stereotype]] about the relative [[intelligence]] of whites, blacks, and Asians, that racial attribute might substitute for the more intangible attribute of intelligence. The pre-conscious, intuitive nature of attribute substitution explains how subjects can be influenced by the stereotype while thinking that they have made an honest, unbiased evaluation of the other person's intelligence.

===Morality and fairness===
[[Cass Sunstein|Sunstein]] argued that attribute substitution is pervasive when people reason about [[morality|moral]], [[political]], or [[legal]] matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |year=2005 |title=Moral Heuristics |journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages= 531–542 |issn=0140-525X |doi=10.1017/S0140525X05000099 |pmid= 16209802}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given a difficult, novel problem in these areas, people search for a more familiar, related problem (a "prototypical case") and apply its solution as the solution to the harder problem. According to Sunstein, the opinions of [[Authority bias|trusted]] political or religious [[Argument from authority|authorities]] can serve as heuristic attributes when people are asked their own opinions on a matter. Another source of heuristic attributes is [[emotion]]: people's moral opinions on sensitive subjects like [[human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[human cloning]] may be driven by reactions such as [[disgust]], rather than by reasoned principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sunstein |first=Cass R. |year=2009 |title=Some Effects of Moral Indignation on Law |journal=Vermont Law Review |publisher=Vermont Law School |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=405–434 |url=http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/articles/3/12%20Sunstein%20Book%203%2C%20Vol.%2033.pdf |accessdate=2009-09-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610021623/http://lawreview.vermontlaw.edu/articles/3/12%20Sunstein%20Book%203%2C%20Vol.%2033.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics demanded more evidence from Sunstein.&lt;ref name="shah2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shah |first=Anuj K. |author-link2=Daniel M. Oppenheimer|first2=Daniel M.|last2=Oppenheimer  |date=March 2008 |title=Heuristics Made Easy: An Effort-Reduction Framework |journal=Psychological Bulletin |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=134 |issue=2 |pages=207–222 |issn=1939-1455 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.134.2.207 |pmid=18298269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The beautiful-is-familiar effect===
Monin reports a series of experiments in which subjects, looking at photographs of faces, have to judge whether they have seen those faces before. It is repeatedly found that attractive faces are more likely to be mistakenly labeled as familiar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Monin |first=Benoît |first2=Daniel M.|last2=Oppenheimer |year=2005 |title=Correlated Averages vs. Averaged Correlations: Demonstrating the Warm Glow Heuristic Beyond Aggregation |journal=Social Cognition |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=257–278 |issn=0278-016X |url=http://web.princeton.edu/sites/opplab/papers/Opp%20Demonstrating%20the%20Warm%20Glow%20Heuristic.pdf |doi=10.1521/soco.2005.23.3.257}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monin interprets this result in terms of attribute substitution. The heuristic attribute in this case is a "warm glow"; a positive feeling towards someone that might either be due to their being familiar or being attractive. This interpretation has been criticised, because not all the [[variance]] in the familiarity data is accounted for by attractiveness.&lt;ref name="shah2008"/&gt;

==Evidence==
The most direct evidence, according to Kahneman,&lt;ref name="kahneman_aer"/&gt; is a 1973 experiment that used a psychological profile of Tom&amp;nbsp;W., a fictional graduate student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=Daniel |first2=Amos |last2=Tversky |date=July 1973 |title=On the Psychology of Prediction |journal=Psychological Review |publisher=American Psychological Association |volume=80 |issue=4 |pages=237–51 |issn= 0033-295X |doi=10.1037/h0034747}}&lt;/ref&gt; One group of subjects had to rate Tom's ''similarity'' to a typical student in each of nine academic areas (Law, Engineering, Library Science etc.). Another group had to rate ''how likely'' it is that Tom specialised in each area. If these ratings of likelihood are governed by [[probability]], then they should resemble the [[base rates]], i.e., the proportion of students in each of the nine areas (which had been separately estimated by a third group). A probabilistic judgment would say that Tom is more likely to be a Humanities student than Library Science, because many more students study Humanities, and the additional information in the profile is vague and unreliable. Instead, the ratings of likelihood matched the ratings of similarity almost perfectly, both in this study and a similar one where subjects judged the likelihood of a fictional woman taking different careers. This suggests that rather than estimating probability using base rates, subjects had substituted the more accessible attribute of similarity.

'''Barbara Haviland Minor''' is an American chemical engineer who has worked at [[DuPont]] (between 1981 and 2015) and [[Chemours]] (since 2015).&lt;ref name=Perkin/&gt; She develops new [[refrigerants]] to be used in [[air conditioning]] and refrigeration systems,&lt;ref name=Perkin/&gt; in Europe, North America, Australia and other countries.&lt;ref name="Ecolibrium"&gt;{{cite news |title=Q&amp;A Barbara Minor |url=https://www.airah.org.au/Content_Files/EcoLibrium/2015/08-15-Eco-002.pdf |accessdate=July 31, 2018 |work=Ecolibrium: The official journal of AIRAH |issue=7|volume=14|pages=25-27 |date=August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2018, 50% of all new vehicles produced by [[original equipment manufacturer]]s (OEMs) are believed to use her refrigerant, [[2,3,3,3-Tetrafluoropropene|HFO-1234yf]],&lt;ref name="VSP2018"/&gt; an important contribution to countering [[global warming]].&lt;ref name=Perkin/&gt;

Minor was one of five women to be named a Dupont Fellow in 2014,&lt;ref name="Fellow"/&gt; the first year that the company named women to its highest technical level.&lt;ref name="Parkersburg"/&gt; She was awarded the [[Perkin Medal]] in 2018.&lt;ref name=Perkin/&gt; 

==Life==
Minor graduated from [[Bucknell University]] in 1981&lt;ref name="Bucknell"&gt;{{cite news |title=Barbara Haviland Minor '81, chemical engineering Keeping Her Cool |url=https://www.bucknell.edu/info-about-attending-bucknell/who-we-are/bucknell-stories/alumni-stories/barbara-haviland-minor-81 |accessdate=July 30, 2018 |work=Bucknell University |date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a Bachelor of Science in chemical engineering.&lt;ref name=Perkin/&gt;&lt;ref name="Influence"/&gt;

==Career==
Minor worked at [[DuPont]] from 1981 to 2015, when she moved to the spinoff company [[Chemours]]&lt;ref name=Perkin/&gt; in [[Wilmington, Delaware]].&lt;ref name="Salitsky"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Salitsky |first1=Cynthia |title=The Chemours Company's Barbara  H.

Minor develops new [[refrigerants]] for [[air conditioning]] and refrigeration systems. Her work supports the phasing out of ozone depleting [[chlorofluorocarbons]] and [[hydrochlorofluorocarbons]], and of [[hydrofluorocarbons]] that contribute to [[global warming]].&lt;ref name=Perkin/&gt;

The '''Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2)''' is a foundation located on the campus of the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] (UAB) whose mission is to promote interdisciplinary research in [[nanoscience]] and [[nanotechnology]]. In addition to research activities, the ICN2 provides training for researchers, education programs and services to industry and the scientific community.

The ICN2 is part of the Catalan Government's organisation for research centres (CERCA) &lt;ref&gt;[http://cerca.cat/en/cerca-centres/ CERCA Centres]&lt;/ref&gt; which aims to encourage and maximise synergies and strategic cooperation between research centres in [[Catalonia]]. The Institute is also a founding member of The Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology which was established in collaboration with five other research centres in Catalonia to achieve greater international competitiveness by promoting multidisciplinary scientific collaboration in the fields of genomic regulation, chemical research nanoscience and nanotechnology, photonic sciences, high energy physic and biomedicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bist.eu/ Barcelona Institute of Science and Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The ICN2 was initially established as the `[[Catalan Institute of Nanotechnology]] (ICN) in 2003, at the initiative of the Catalan government and the UAB with the aim of attracting international research talent to create a world renowned centre for nanoscience and nanotechnology research.
Following collaborations between the ICN and the Spanish government's Centre for Research in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (CIN2), the ICN and the Spanish Research Council (CSIC) agreed to put their collaboration on an official footing and signed a memorandum of understanding to this effect in 2006.

This agreement was formalised in 2011, when CSIC representatives joined the ICN's board of patrons and then in 2013, when the ICN changed its name to the Catalan Institute of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (ICN2).
In addition to research, management and financial synergies, an important outcome of this agreement was the construction of a new building on the UAB campus containing state-of-the-art equipment and purpose-built research facilities. The building was inaugurated in 2014 and provides facilities for 180 researchers and 40 technical and support staff.

[[Image:lichfieldclose.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|[[Cathedral Close, Lichfield|Lichfield Cathedral Close]]]]
A '''cathedral close''' is the area immediately around a [[cathedral]], sometimes extending for a hundred metres or more from the main cathedral building. In Europe in the Middle Ages, and often later, it was usually all the property of the cathedral and under the bishop or cathedral's legal jurisdiction rather than that of the city. It normally had gates which were locked at night or when there were disturbances in the city, hence the name. It usually included buildings housing diocesan offices, schools, free-standing chapels associated with the cathedral, and the palace of the [[bishop]] and other [[clergy]] houses associated with the cathedral. They sometimes but not necessarily are arranged in a sort of square around a courtyard, as in the close at [[Salisbury Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/file/map-salisbury-cathedral-closejpg-3 map of the close at [[Salisbury Cathedral]]]&lt;/ref&gt; The German term is [[Domfreiheit]].

Today there are often residences of non-clerics, which may include official or prominent persons such as judges' houses. Until recent local government reforms many cathedral closes still functioned as separate administrative unit: [[St. David's]] cathedral close, in [[Pembrokeshire]], counted as a separate civil parish from that of the adjacent village-city for some 50 years after the [[disestablishment]] in Wales. Others still have the secularised former residences of canons but no resident senior clergy. In other cities, such as [[Trier]], property close to the cathedral is occupied by clergy.

==In literature==

The Barchester novels ([[Chronicles of Barsetshire]]) of [[Anthony Trollope]] are set largely in the cathedral close of the fictional town of Barchester.

'''Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs''', (or '''CAAHEP'''), is an agency of [[accreditation]]  for the accredits postsecondary education programs in 28 health science fields.

Programmatic accreditation is granted after an education program is reviewed and it is determined that the program is in compliance with the profession's accreditation Standards.&lt;ref&gt;The profession's accreditation Standards designate what an entry-level health care employee in a particular field needs to know in order to be successful in that field&lt;/ref&gt; A not-for-profit organization, CAAHEP is recognized by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA). It is based in [[Clearwater, Florida]].

== Members and leadership ==

*CAAHEP's members are organizations that represent the professions accredited by CAAHEP and/or the institutions that teach CAAHEP accredited programs.
*CAAHEP's leadership is composed of both a Commission and a Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caahep.org/Member-Organizations-and-Their-Commissioners/ CAAHEP Commissioners and Board of Directors]&lt;/ref&gt;

The individuals who serve as Commissioners are representatives from CAAHEP's sponsoring organizations, along with a recent graduate of a CAAHEP accredited program and members of the general public.  The Commissioners approve the organization's mission, vision, and bylaws, and decide which health science professions qualify to take part in the CAAHEP accreditation system.  CAAHEP is also led by a Board of Directors, whose members are elected from among the Commissioners.When an education program in a health science profession seeks CAAHEP accreditation, the program will work with that profession's Committee on Accreditation (CoA).&lt;ref&gt;It is the CoA that leads the program through accreditation process, reviewing the self-study, organizing the site visit of the program, and formulating the accreditation recommendation of the program for approval by the CAAHEP Board of Directors&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief History ==

In 1904, the [[American Medical Association]] established its Council on Medical Education (CME). The CME developed a rating system of medical schools in 1905, initiated inspections in 1906, and classified the institutions in 1907. The AMA then collaborated with the Carnegie Foundation to conduct a study of the quality of medical education that resulted in the [[Flexner Report]] in 1910. These early efforts subsequently led to the development of specialized accreditation for the education of health professionals. It was also the precursor of accreditation activities for most other professional associations.

Early in the 1930s, several national bodies requested the collaboration of the AMA in establishing accreditation for education programs in their areas of interest. These early efforts established a basis and pattern for the role of the AMA in collaborating with other national associations for the accreditation of health sciences education programs. From 1935 through 1976, the recognized agency was the AMA Council on Medical Education. In 1976 the CME delegated to the newly formed Committee on Allied Health Education and Accreditation (CAHEA) the responsibility and authority for health sciences education accreditation. In October, 1992 the AMA announced its intent to support the establishment of a new and independent agency to assume the accreditation responsibilities of CAHEA&lt;ref&gt;That new agency, the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP) was incorporated in May, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs Accredited by CAAHEP==

CAAHEP accredits over 2,200 programs in 28 health science disciplines. The programs reside in more than 1,300 postsecondary educational institutions across the United States and [[Canada]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5684">The '''Conservative Research Department'''  ('''CRD''') is part of the central organisation of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It operates alongside other departments of [[Conservative Campaign Headquarters]] in [[Westminster]].

The CRD has been described as a training ground for leading Conservative politicians. Former CRD advisers to have served in the Cabinet include former Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], former Chancellor of the Exchequer [[George Osborne]], former Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster [[Oliver Letwin]] and former Health Secretary [[Andrew Lansley]]. After 1945, [[Enoch Powell]], [[Iain Macleod]], [[Reginald Maudling]] and [[Chris Patten]] passed through it.&lt;ref name=Bodley1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/modern/cpa/cco/crd.html |title=Conservative Party Archive: Conservative Research Department|publisher=Bodley.ox.ac.uk |date=2004 |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Neville Chamberlain===
The CRD was established by [[Neville Chamberlain]] in 1929, to undertake detailed policy work for the leader of the Party (then [[Stanley Baldwin]]) and his principal colleagues. It was the first real think-tank on the right in British politics.&lt;ref name=bodley2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bodley.ox.ac.uk/dept/scwmss/wmss/online/modern/cpa/crd/crd.html |title=Conservative Party Archive |publisher=Bodley.ox.ac.uk |date=2014-01-07 |accessdate=2014-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For 50 years it occupied its own premises in Old Queen Street overlooking St James's Park, but after the 1979 election, [[Margaret Thatcher]] united it physically with the rest of the Party's Central Office.

===Rab Butler===
The CRD's work was suspended during the [[World War II|Second World War]], but it was re-established on a wider basis with a larger staff by [[Rab Butler]], who would be its chairman from 1945 until 1965&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-923X.2004.00638.x/abstract |title= Echoes of Butler? The Conservative Research Department and the Making of Conservative Policy|date=2004-11-23 |accessdate=2014-01-18 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-923X.2004.00638.x |volume=75 |journal=The Political Quarterly |pages=378–382}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its post-war role included the provision of briefing material on major legislation before Parliament and on the main issues of political controversy, as well as working with Butler to define post-war Conservatism.

The CRD was determined Conservative policy during the [[post-war consensus]] until it broke down in the 1970s. The series of [[Campaign Guide]]s that the CRD began to produce in 1950 recorded in detail the progress of Conservative governments in this period. More recent volumes in the series have continued to provide a full, official account of Conservative policy and its implementation.

===Margaret Thatcher===
When [[Margaret Thatcher]] became Conservative Party leader in 1975, the CRD organised a full policy review to be co-ordinated by [[Sir Keith Joseph]] which preceded her election as prime minister. In office she valued the CRD primarily for the way in which it communicated to the Conservative Party at large that radical political change was needed and how Britain was being transformed as a result of these changes. The CRD was a link between a reforming administration and the party on whose support it depended. It produced her general election manifestos and worked closely with her during election campaigns.&lt;ref name=Butler /&gt; The Director appointed in 1979 was [[Adam Ridley]], who since 1974 had been Economic Adviser to the Shadow Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;'RIDLEY, Sir Adam (Nicholas)', in ''[[Who's Who (UK)|Who's Who 2014]]'' (London: A. &amp; C. Black, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the CRD co-funded a trip of [[David Cameron]] and other Conservative researchers to [[South Africa]] while under [[apartheid]] rule, alongside the Strategy Network International, which was created in 1985 to lobby against [[Disinvestment from South Africa|anti-apartheid sanctions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dejevsky |first1=Mary |title=Cameron's freebie to apartheid South Africa |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/camerons-freebie-to-apartheid-south-africa-1674367.html |accessdate=15 August 2018 |work=The Independent |date=25 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group continued to work closely with the party leader and other senior figures. During the 2005 election campaign, the CRD was again the leader's policy secretariat, assisting [[Michael Howard]]'s close advisers with the formulation of the Conservative position on key subjects and the development of the strategy for the campaign. Under the editorship of [[Alistair Cooke, Baron Lexden|Alistair Cooke]], the CRD also wrote and published the latest volume of the Campaign Guide, providing detailed policy and political attack material.

===David Cameron===
Under [[David Cameron]] the CRD was reorganised; in June 2006, Desk Officers were retitled as Special Advisers to the Shadow Cabinet and relocated to the House of Commons, while the enlarged political section and policy secretariat remained at Campaign HQ. This was reversed the following year when, in September 2007, the possibility of an early general election prompted the Party leadership to move Special Advisers back in-house to the new Campaign Headquarters at 30 Millbank.

The '''Earth Charter Initiative''' is the collective name for the global network of people, organizations, and institutions who participate in promoting the [[Earth Charter]], and in implementing its principles in practice. The Initiative is a broad-based, voluntary, [[civil society]] effort, but participants include leading international institutions, national government agencies, university associations, [[non-governmental organization|NGO]]s, cities, faith groups, and many well-known leaders in [[sustainable development]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

== Mission and goals ==
The stated mission of the Earth Charter Initiative is to promote the transition to sustainable ways of living and a global society founded on a shared ethical framework that includes respect and care for the community of life, [[Ecological health|ecological integrity]], universal [[human rights]], [[Respect diversity|respect for diversity]], economic justice, [[democracy]], and a culture of [[peace]].

===Goals===
#To raise awareness worldwide of the Earth Charter and to promote understanding of its inclusive ethical vision.  
#To seek recognition and endorsement of the Earth Charter by individuals, organizations, and the [[United Nations]].
#To promote the use of the Earth Charter as an ethical guide and the implementation of its principles by civil society, business, and government.  
#To encourage and support the educational use of the Earth Charter in schools, universities, religious communities, local communities, and many other settings.  
#To promote recognition and use of the Earth Charter as a [[soft law]] document.

===Strategic objectives===
* To promote development of a global network of Earth Charter supporters and activists with the collaboration of advisors, affiliates, partner organizations, and task forces.
* To create and disseminate high quality communications and educational materials to different target groups that will reach millions of people.
* To translate key Earth Charter materials in all major languages of the world.
* To set up Earth Charter websites in all countries in partnership with key individuals and organizations.
* To promote the Earth Charter vision in key local, national and international events and engage individuals and organizations in applying it in their areas of activity.
* To position the Earth Charter in relation to important international initiatives and processes so that its ethical framework can be used as a guide in efforts to address urgent challenges such as climate change, [[biodiversity loss]], the [[Millennium Development Goals]], [[food security]], and [[conflict resolution]].
* To undertake training programmes to facilitate the uptake and application of the Earth Charter in different sectors.
* To develop the guidance and instruments to help organizations, businesses, and local communities use the Earth Charter to assess progress toward sustainable development.

== Organization ==
A formal network of affiliates, partners, and youth groups helps to promote the Earth Charter around the world. Many of these representatives are based in prominent national-level organizations and institutions.

The Initiative is served and coordinated by [[Earth Charter International]], which is composed by an Executive Office called the ECI Secretariat, and by the ECI Council.  The Secretariat is composed by a very small staff, and it is based at [[University for Peace|the University for Peace]] campus in [[San José, Costa Rica]]. The Council is equivalent to a Board, they meet once a year and provide strategic guidance to the Secretariat and the EC Initiative.

== Earth Charter Youth Program ==
The Earth Charter Youth program is a network of youth NGOs and young activists who share a common interest in sustainable development and the Earth Charter. [[Severn Cullis-Suzuki]] from Vancouver, Canada was nominated as [[youth]] representative in the Earth Charter Commission, which oversaw the drafting process. At the age of 17, Severn participated in the Earth Summit of 1997 and made sure that concerns of young people were taken seriously in the process of drafting the Earth Charter. She contributed to the inclusion of principle 12c in the final version of the Earth Charter which stresses the need to: “Honor and support the young people of our communities, enabling them to fulfill their essential role in creating sustainable societies.” The launch of the Earth Charter Youth program was inspired by this ethical principle. Today there are two youth representatives on the Earth Charter International Council.

Built in 1968, '''El Mercado de Los Angeles''' is located in the Boyle Heights district of the city of Los Angeles east of the LA River and adjacent to East Los Angeles (an unincorporated portion of the County of Los Angeles often cited as the heart of the Mexican/American community) on the corner of 1st Street and Lorena Street and is accessible by the Metro Gold Line's [[Indiana (Los Angeles Metro station)|Indiana Station]] located two blocks east.  El Mercado is a three-floor indoor shopping center that offers dining and restaurant services, entertainment with live mariachi bands and shopping from various vendors. Although El Mercado is themed and represents a space that honors [[Mexico]] and [[Mexican culture]], other Latinos from different ethnicities visit and shop there.&lt;ref name="El Mercado de Los Angeles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Directory of El Mercado de Los Angeles|url=http://www.elmercadodelosangeles.com/history.php|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=28 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an indoor shopping and meeting place, El Mercado also provides economic agency for Latinos as vendors selling music and films, exotic boots, belts, hats, a jewelry store, Mexican handcrafts, toys, cosmetics and services such as travel and sending money to their natal communities.&lt;ref name="Swap meets and Socioeconomic Alternatives"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barros-Nock|first=Magdalena|title=Swap meets and Socioeconomic Alternatives for Mexican Immigrants: The Case of San Joaquin Valley|journal=Human Organization|date=2 September 2009|volume=68|issue=3|pages=307–317|url=http://sfaa.metapress.com/content/6550852777144576/fulltext.pdf|accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through selling and bartering Latino vendors engage in market exchanges that give agency to both the buyer and seller. El Mercado de Los Angeles is a place where Latinos can gather together for social purposes and to enjoy cultural experiences through food, music, and other forms of semiotics such as the paintings on the buildings and a mural of the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Virgen de Guadalupe]] that link them to their native lands.

== Cultural de-territorialization and identity ==
In East Los Angeles, Latinos constitute approximately 97.1% of the population.&lt;ref name="East Los Angeles demographic information"&gt;{{cite web|title=East Los Angeles Demographic Data|url=http://www.city-data.com/city/East-Los-Angeles-California.html|publisher=CityData.com|accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heavy population of Latinos in [[Eastside Los Angeles|East Los Angeles]] demonstrates the appropriation of space due to the process of [[deterritorialization|de-territorialization]]. De-territorialization of culture refers to the weakening relationships between culture and place.&lt;ref&gt;[[Deterritorialization]]&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, many thought of culture restricted in localized terms, that is cultural was rooted to a particular geographical area, nation, or state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inda|first=Jonathan Xavier|author2=Renato Rosaldo|title=The Anthropology of Globalization|journal=A world in motion|year=2002|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as East Los Angeles proves different, Latinos as cultural subjects, continue to traverse national borders bringing along with them their cultural practices and traditions in different territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Inda|first=Jonathan Xavier|author2=Renato Rosaldo|title=The Anthropology of Globalization|journal=A world in motion|year=2002|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Territorialization on the other hand can be more understood as the process of turning a space into a place, as explained by Clara Irazabal and Ramzi Farhart in their article “Latino Communities in the United States: Place-Making in the Pre-World War II, Postwar, and Contemporary City”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Irazábal|first=Clara|author2=Ramzi Farhat|title=Latino Communities in the United States: Place-Making in the Pre-World War II, Postwar, and Contemporary City|journal=Journal of Planning Literature|year=2008|volume=22|issue=3|pages=207|doi=10.1177/0885412207310146}}&lt;/ref&gt;

El Mercado is place that allows Latinos to assert their identity to foster a sense of belonging and build an intimate community space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guitérrez Nájera|first=Lourdes|title=Hayandose: Zapotex Migrant Expressions of Membership and Belonging|journal=Beyond El Barrio: Everyday life in Latina/o America|year=2010|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lourdes Gutierrez Nájera explains in her article “Hayandoese: Zapotec Migrant Expressions of Membership and Belonging” how Yalaltecos communities in Los Angeles affirm their identity and create a sense of ethnic belonging and community through participation in life cycle events and every day practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guitérrez Nájera|first=Lourdes|title=Hayandose: Zapotex Migrant Expressions of Membership and Belonging|journal=Beyond El Barrio: Everyday life in Latina/o America|year=2010|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his article “Swap meets, Flea Markets, and Open-Air Public Markets: a community and economic development model for low-income and underserved neighborhoods”, Jeffrey Edwin Juarez describes swap meets as regular meeting spaces that people treat as recreation places, much like a park, to spend time together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Juarez|first=Jeffery Edwin|title=Swap Meets, Flea Markets, and Open-Air Public Markets: A community and economic development model for low-income and underserved neighborhoods|year=2011|page=12|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/69455|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Mercado is a community pace for Latino’s for both local’s and visitors to interact, spend time together and share experiences. One way El Mercado fosters its community space is through its large restaurant located on the third floor popularly known as El Mercadito, which is actually themed in to three different restaurants representing different cities of Mexico that make up the one large restaurant.&lt;ref name="El Mercado de Los Angeles"/&gt; El Mercadito restaurant is widely used by families and friends as a community space to make reservations for birthday celebrations, wedding receptions, quincenera receptions, and other banquet purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=El Mercadito Restaurant Directory|url=http://www.elmercaditorestaurant.com/HTML/reservaciones/reservation.html|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=26 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic agency at El Mercado ==
El Mercado de Los Angeles serves a significant economic purpose for Latinos in the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Los Angeles region]]. For the customers at El Mercado, the mercado provides affordable items that make shopping accessible for people across income levels. Also importantly, mercados foster relationships between vendors.&lt;ref name="Sherry 1990 13-30"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherry|first=John F.|title=A Sociocultural Analysis of A Midwestern American Flea Market|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=June 1990|volume=17|issue=1|pages=13–30|doi=10.1086/208533}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competition between vendors exists, but mercados in general often function as sites of both economic competition and collaboration between vendors within the mercado.&lt;ref name="Sherry 1990 13-30"/&gt; The sense of competition is increased between the relationship between vendor and customer.

At swap meets, or mercados like El Mercado, complex relationships exist between buyers and sellers.&lt;ref name="Russell W. Belk, John F. Sherry, Jr. and Melanie Wallendorf 1988 457"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russell W. Belk, John F. Sherry, Jr. and Melanie Wallendorf|title=A Naturalistic Inquiry Into Buyer and Seller Behavior at a Swapmeet|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|date=March 1988|volume=14|issue=4|page=457|doi=10.1086/209128|first1=Russell W.|last2=Sherry, Jr.|first2=John F.|last3=Wallendorf|first3=Melanie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercados are less bureaucratic spaces that corporate stores or even independent businesses.&lt;ref name="Russell W. Belk, John F. Sherry, Jr. and Melanie Wallendorf 1988 457"/&gt; Vendors must apply for a permit at El Mercado, yet the vendors frequently make informal exchanges such as bartering/trading, or bargaining for prices. These informal market exchanges give [[agency (sociology)|agency]] to both the buyer and seller because each have a role in setting the terms of the business transaction. El Mercado de Los Ángeles not only provides cultural significance to the consumers who come to it, but it also provides a space for affordable items and economic negotiation.

== Monetary and cultural remittances at El Mercado ==
El Mercado de Los Angeles offers a variety of services that help send off monetary remittances to [[Latin America]]. The Mercado also provides travel and calling services that help customers participate in the formation of cultural remittances to Latin America.&lt;ref name="El Mercado de Los Angeles"/&gt;

=== Monetary remittances at El Mercado ===
El Mercado also serves as an important site of cultural and monetary remittances between the United States and [[México]], specifically. This mercado is a site of cultural that is the product of cultural hybridities. It is also a site that actively constructs cultural hybridities in the United States and México. El Mercado offers services to send money back to México securely as well as offering a [[bureau de change|currency exchange]] between [[peso]]s and United States dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Directory of El Mercado de Los Angeles|url=http://www.elmercadodelosangeles.com/directory.php|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers are able to send monetary remittance home to México by using the services at the Mercado. These services also assist vendors at the Mercado send some of the profits that they make at the Mercado to family members or communities abroad. These remittances are often directed at families or [[hometown associations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sana|first=Mariano|title=Growth of Migrant Remittances from the United States to Mexico, 1990-2004|journal=Social Forces|date=March 2008|volume=86|issue=3|page=1001|doi=10.1353/sof.0.0002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural remittances at El Mercado ===
The Mercado de Los Angeles also facilitates opportunities to create [[cultural remittances]] for Latino migrants. The mercado offers international calling services and a [[travel agency]] that sells international plane tickets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Directory of El Mercado de Los Angeles|url=http://www.elmercadodelosangeles.com/directory.php|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These services aid the fluid migratory process that physically transports migrants from their countries of origin to the countries of current residence. Along with the physical transportation, the Mercado specializes in transculturated goods and items. Many of the stores specialize in traditional Mexican clothing, books, or films. Yet, these traditional items are presented in a transculturated context, outside of [[México]] or [[Latin America]]. The mercado becomes a transculturated site that participates in cultural remittance when it facilitates the physical circular migration of migrants returning to their home country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Flores|first=Juan|title=The Diaspora Strikes Back: Caribeño Tales of Learning and Turning|year=2008|publisher=Rutledge|isbn=0415952611|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Migrants returning home bring cultural remittances to the land that they left, and El Mercado de Los Angeles is an important site of this cultural remittance process in Los Angeles.

== Semiotic meaning-making at El Mercado ==
El Mercado de Los Angeles actively produces and shapes culture through a variety of ways. Semiotics describes a series of processes in which meaning is given to the world around humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturken|first=Marita |last2=Cartwright|first2=Lisa|title=Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195314409|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; As humans interpret visual sensory clues about the world, meaning and culture are produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturken |first=Marita |last2=Cartwright|first2=Lisa|title=Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195314409|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the mercado, mariachi music and visual murals are two principal ways that semiotic processes produce culture.

=== Mariachi at El Mercado ===
The cultural significance of El Mercado is complemented by presence of semiotic cultural elements such as music and the murals present at El Mercado. Semiotics is a process through which visuals, sounds, and other sensory experiences are given meaning and made socially significant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sturken|first=Marita |last2=Cartwright|first2=Lisa|title=Practices of Looking: An Introduction to Visual Culture|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195314409|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of semiotic meaning-making is present at the mercado, especially through the mariachi restaurants. The third floor of the mercado is composed of three restaurants that are well known for not only the food but the mariachi music that they all play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mariachi at El Mercado|url=http://www.elmercadodelosangeles.com/mariachi-en.php|publisher=El Mercado de Los Angeles|accessdate=1 Jun 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolores Inés Casillas, a theorist who writes about cultural semiotics, considers listening to sound a political practice. She views nostalgic sounds from home countries as a means of remembering the home country while constructing space in the land of migration.&lt;ref name="Casillas 2010 55"&gt;{{cite book|last=Casillas|first=Dolores|chapter=¡Puuurrrooo MÉXICO!|chapter-url=https://www.academia.edu/6938122/Puuurrrooo_M%C3%89XICO_Listening_to_Transnationalism_on_U.S._Spanish-language_Radio|title=Beyond El Barrio: Everyday Life in Latina/o America|editor1=Gina M. Perez|editor2=Frank A. Guridy|editor3=Adrian Burgos, Jr.|year=2010|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8147-9129-5|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sense of political listening supports the idea that El Mercado de Los Angeles is an active sight of cultural production through the visuals and music present at the mercado.

=== Murals at El Mercado ===
The Mercado de Los Angeles website also portrays some of the several [[murals]] that are present at this marketplace. The themed [[mariachi]] restaurants on the third floor provide a visual representation that constructs a cultural space in the heart of [[Los Angeles]]. From the [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]] inspired dining room to an [[Aztec]] themed dining room, the mercado provides many visions of a traditional ''México lindo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photo Gallery|url=http://www.elmercaditorestaurant.com/HTML/photo%20album/photo_album.html|publisher=El Mercadito Restaurant}}&lt;/ref&gt; These visual forms are not representations of transnational scenes, but of pastoral memories of historical scenes. These pastoral visuals represent an idealized and fond memory of areas throughout Latin America. This space provides meaningful space for the customers of El Mercado de Los Angeles and contributes to the semiotic construction of cultural hybrities at the mercado. The semiotic components of meaning-making affect the Mercado of Los Angeles as a site of economic and cultural significance.

[[File:ECN-terrein Petten.jpg|thumb|right|ECN in Petten]]
The '''Energy Research Centre of the Netherlands''' ('''ECN''') is one of the largest [[energy]] research institute in Europe and holds a strong international position. With and for the market, ECN develops knowledge and technology that enable a transition to a sustainable energy system. The main office is located in [[Petten]]. ECN also has offices in [[Amsterdam]], [[Eindhoven]], [[Wieringermeer]], [[Brussels]] and [[China]]. ECN has a staff of about 550 employees.

==Activities==
ECN’s research and technology development focuses on:
* [[Solar Energy]]
* [[Wind Energy]]
* [[Biomass]]
* Environmental research
* Energy efficiency
* Policy Studies

The total package of sustainable energy generation, clean use of fossil fuels and reduction of total energy use are key topics. ECN also conducts research on future opportunities and economic backgrounds in the field of energy.

==Publications==
ECN researchers disseminate their results in publications such as reports, peer reviewed articles in scientific and professional journals, conference contributions and books and chapters in books. In 2011, ECN published 481 reports (public and confidential) and 176 articles in scientific journals.

==International position==
ECN participates in international projects, advises authorities and collaborates with the industry in the Netherlands, Europe and worldwide. A number of examples:
* EERA: together with nine other research organisations in Europe, ECN founded the European Energy Research Alliance (EERA). The aim is to harmonise the research programmes through joint research and optimal deployment of facilities. 
* ADEM: an initiative of ECN and three collaborating Technical Universities ([[Delft University of Technology]], [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], and the [[University of Twente]]). They wish to give strong impetus to Dutch materials research in relation to energy technology.
* FLOW: the FLOW programme enables Dutch businesses to take a leading position on the international market for offshore wind farms. The programme was initiated by RWE, Eneco, TenneT, Ballast Nedam, Van Oord, IHC Merwede, 2-B Energy, XECM Darwind, ECN and Delft University of technology. 
* Solliance: Solliance is a collaboration of TNO, Eindhoven University of Technology, ECN and IMEC, focusing on research and development in the field of thin film solar panels (PV) in the ELAT region (Eindhoven-Louvain-Aachen triangle).
* CARENA ('''CA'''talytic '''RE'''actors based on '''N'''ew m'''A'''terials): a European collaborative project coordinated by ECN. The project aim to create possibilities for the use of cheaper, less reactive, raw materials by using membrane reactor technology. CARENA brings together companies and institutes from 8 European countries. European chemical companies as Akzo Nobel and Arkema ensure a strong industrial leadership to the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecn.nl/fileadmin/ecn/units/ei/images/IEG/Public_project_summary_CARENA_-_negotiation_phase.pdf |title=Public project summary CARENA - negotiation phase |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, ECN participates in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and the [[International Energy Agency]].

==History==
ECN received its current name in 1976. Before that time, the centre, which was founded in 1955, was solely focused on the peaceful deployment of nuclear energy  under the name of Reactor Centre Netherlands (RCN). In 1976 it became clear that the energy supply of the future should not rely on nuclear energy alone. Alternative forms of energy were called for. RCN was appointed as the institute that should conduct the largest part of this research.

==Subsidiary company==
The [[Nuclear Research and Consultancy Group]] (NRG) is a full subsidiary of ECN and the most important manufacturer of radio-active isotopes for medical use in Europe. NRG manages the nuclear reactors in Petten, which are owned by the European Union.
Admatec Europe is partially owned by ECN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3dprintingmaterialsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/20140620_Admatecprintconf_publ.pdf |title=Presentation Admatec Europe 2014 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admatec Europe manufactures ceramic components via 3D printing.

==Board of directors and Supervisory Board==
The Board of directors of ECN consists of one statutory director (chairman of the board of directors) and two deputy directors. The Supervisory Board consists of six members. It is the duty of the Supervisory Board to supervise the administration of the foundation by the Board of directors as well as the general affairs. The members of the Supervisory Board are appointed by the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation.

== Controversies == 
A former director of ECN, Wim Stam, made headlines with his private investment in four windmills. In his role as public servant, Wim Stam also advised the Dutch Government on the placement, quality and efficiency of wind mills.
Wim made over one million Euros with his private investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/economie/belangenverstrengeling-bij-adviseur-windenergie~a4230597/ |title=Conflict of Interest Article Volkskrant 2016 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his actions, ECN changed its regulations so conflict of interests would be prevented in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/ecn-scherpt-regels-aan-na-schijn-van-belangenverstrengeling~a4242972/ |title=ECN changes regulations after conflict of Interest Wim Stam, Volkskrant 2016 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main European legal instruments covering the mutual recognition of [[professional certification|professional qualifications]]:  '''Directive 89/48/EEC''' and '''Directive 92/51/EEC'''.

'''Directive 89/48/EEC''' covers the mutual recognition of qualifications in recognised professions that require a [[academic degree|University degree]] or equivalent.  This [[European Union directive|directive]] is implemented in the UK by '''The European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) (First General System) Regulations 2005''' and by similar regulations in other member states.

'''Directive 92/51/EEC''' covers the mutual recognition of qualifications in professions regulated below degree level.  This is implemented in the UK by '''The European Communities (Recognition of Professional Qualifications) (Second General System) Regulations 2002''' and by similar regulations in other member states.

The Directives cover all twenty-eight member states of the [[European Union]] plus [[Norway]], [[Iceland]] and [[Liechtenstein]].

They mean that any form of work that would normally be restricted in a member state to people who had gained a professional qualification in that member state are also open to nationals of the EU (and the other three states) who have gained a similar professional qualification in another member state.

This applies to all forms of work other than those covered by either

the '''Transitional Measures Directive''' (Directive 99/42/EC, covering crafts and trades people such as hairdressers and construction workers)

or the '''Sectoral Directives''' ([[Medicine]], [[Dentistry]], [[Pharmacy]], [[Nursing |General Care Nursing]],  [[Veterinary]] Surgery, [[Architect |Architecture]], and [[Lawyer |Law]] (This set of Directives was the original method of achieving mutual recognition but proved too slow)

Professions regulated in most or all EU states include:

Accountancy -  British-qualified [[Accountant |Accountants]] ([[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|Chartered Certified Accountant]] (ACCA) or [[Chartered Accountant]] (ACA or CA) or [[International Accountant]](AIA) in the UK)

Engineering - [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineer]], or [[Eur Ing]] (European Ingénieur), [[Incorporated Engineer |Incorporated Engineer (UK)]], Corporate membership of a UK professional engineering Institution such as [[Institution of Engineering and Technology|MIET - Member of the Institution of Engineering and Technology]]

Teaching - [[Teacher]]s (Qualified Teacher Status in the UK)

Law - [[Lawyer |Lawyers]] ([[Barrister |Barristers]], [[Solicitor |Solicitors]] and [[Advocate |Advocates]] in the UK).

Note that the regulations only apply to nationals of the 27 countries - e.g. an American who gained Qualified Teacher Status in the UK would not be able, under these regulations, to teach in France, but an Irish citizen would. However, the situation would be different if the American were married to a European ''and'' they were living in a country other than the country of which the European is a national.

The Directives referred to above have been consolidated under Directive 2005/36/EC.  This was to be transposed by Member States in October 2007.

Other graduate destinations include the United Nations, World Bank, World Economic Forum, and various NGO-groups.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsps.cam.ac.uk/ Faculty of Human, Social, and Political Science]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faculty houses 3 departments: Department of Archaeology and Anthropology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archanth.cam.ac.uk/ Department of Archaeology and Anthropology]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Department of Politics and International Studies, University of Cambridge|Department of Politics and International Studies]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polis.cam.ac.uk/ Department of Politics and International Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; and Department of Sociology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociology.cam.ac.uk/ Department of Sociology]&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these departments has a worldwide reputation for teaching and research, and the undergraduate curriculum (Tripos) is designed to serve both students who have a clear disciplinary commitment at the time of application as well as those who want a broader multidisciplinary degree. Students with a passion for politics can take advantage of links with such departments as Economics and History, those with interests in Sociology can draw on Anthropology and Geography, while those dedicated to pursuing an archaeology career can specialise from the first year or combine this with Biological and Social Anthropology.

Undergraduate students study several disciplines in their first year and then specialise in one or two disciplines in their second and third years. Clearly specified tracks (Archaeology, Biological Anthropology, Politics, Psychology, Social Anthropology, Sociology, or a combination of disciplines) ensure that students graduate with appropriate intellectual and professional skills. Assyriology and Egyptology are also possible specialisations, within the Archaeology track.

At the postgraduate level, there are established one-year M.Phils in Archaeology (including Assyriology and Egyptology), Biological Anthropology, International Studies, Social Anthropology and Sociology. A new M.Phil in Politics was launched in 2008. Ph.D students conduct research within a wide range of subjects within Archaeology, Assyriology, Egyptology, Biological and Social Anthropology, Politics &amp; International Studies and Sociology.

The Faculty is currently spread across several sites. The SPS Library (now affiliated with the University Library) and the Department of Sociology are on Free School Lane at the [[New Museums Site]]. The Department of Politics &amp; International Studies is currently located at the Alison Richard Building on the [[Sidgwick Site]]. The Department of Archaeology &amp; Anthropology is spread across the Downing Site, New Museums Site, and Henry Wellcome Building.

==Teaching==
'''Tripos (BA)'''

An Archaeology and Anthropology Tripos has been taught at Cambridge for more than a century. A Politics, Psychology and Sociology [[Tripos]] (previously known as Social and Political Sciences, "SPS") has been running at [[Cambridge University]], in some form, since 1970.  From 2013, the PPS and A&amp;A Triposes will be replaced by the Human, Social, and Political Sciences Tripos (HSPS), which will offer students the opportunity to explore a wide range of multi-disciplinary options before specialising in one or two subjects, or to specialise from the first year, according to their interests. 

'''Postgraduate (MPhil/PhD)'''

The Faculty teaches seven masters programmes in  Politics, International Studies, Sociology, Social Anthropology, Social and Developmental Psychology, Archaeology (including Assyriology and Egyptology), Biological Anthropology. The Faculty also has around 200 students studying for doctorates at any one time. Many graduate students go on to work in politics and government in the United Kingdom, United States, Canada, Australia, and China. Other graduate destinations include the [[United Nations]], [[World Bank]], [[World Economic Forum]], and various NGO-groups.

==Applications==
The number of applicants per place for Politics, Psychology and Sociology has traditionally been one of the highest in Cambridge. On average, there are six applications per offered place, though this ratio is better at some colleges such as Murray Edwards. Colleges with particular teaching strength in Human, Social, and Political Science include [[Selwyn College, Cambridge|Selwyn]], [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius]], [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens']], [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]], [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge|Sidney Sussex]], [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Corpus Christi]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/statistics/subjects.html#pps http://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/apply/statistics ;]&lt;/ref&gt; Numbers of applications for the new HSPS BA course remain high across all colleges.

Eventually Saladino went by one name, "Gaspar," which he wrote in his trademark calligraphy.

From 1966 to the 1990s he lettered many of the logos, titles, captions and balloons on [[DC Comics]] covers.&lt;ref name="klein3"&gt;Klein, Todd. [http://kleinletters.com/Blog/gaspar-saladino-1927-2016/ "Gaspar Saladino 1927-2016"], Kleinletters.com (Aug. 7, 2016). Retrieved August 8, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; For a period in the 1970s, he was also "page-one letterer" for many [[Marvel Comics]] books.&lt;ref name="klein3" /&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Saladino was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York City, and attended Manhattan's [[School of Industrial Art]].&lt;ref name=kleinpart1 /&gt; While in school Saladino did some [[comic-book]] [[inker|inking]] for [[Lloyd Jacquet]]'s "[[Funnies, Inc.]]", one of several "packagers" of the time that produced outsourced comics for publishers entering the new medium.&lt;ref name=kleinpart1 /&gt; After graduating from high school, Saladino enlisted in the [[U.S. Army]], which stationed him in Japan in a [[public relations]] capacity.&lt;ref name=kleinpart1 /&gt; He returned home in 1947.

=== Career ===

==== Lettering ====
In 1949, he approached [[DC Comics]], where production chief [[Sol Harrison]] showed Saladino's art samples to editors. One, [[Julius Schwartz]], while unimpressed with the art, offered Saladino regular work as a [[letterer]].&lt;ref name=kleinpart1 /&gt; Though working in the office, ensconced between letterer [[Ira Schnapp]] and production artist [[Mort Drucker]], Saladino was employed as a freelancer, earning $2 a page and generally earning $90 a week.&lt;ref name=kleinpart1 /&gt; He recalled in a 2007 interview, "DC wanted a full-time letterer and by being present I got first choice of assignments. I also thought it was beneficial to be able to work hand in hand with the artists."&lt;ref name="BDS" /&gt;

Saladino recalled in 2007 that his first job for DC was a "cowboy romance" comic.&lt;ref name="BDS" /&gt; The title was ''Romance Trail'' #5 (March–April 1950) in which he lettered two stories, "Romance By Mail" with art by Carmine Infantino and Joe Giella, and a one-page poem "Western Serenade" with art by Alex Toth. These were Saladino's first printed works for DC.&lt;ref name=kleinpart1 /&gt; They were followed by more work in ''Romance Trail'' and the western series ''Jimmy Wakely'', starting with issue #5 (June 1950).&lt;ref name=gcd&gt;[http://www.comics.org/letterer/name/gaspar%20saladino/sort/chrono/ Gaspar Saladino] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

He did much of the lettering for the humor strips of [[Henry Boltinoff]] in ''[[Action Comics]]''. In the late 1950s and 1960s, Saladino was a mainstay on DC editor [[Julius Schwartz]]'s books, like ''[[Strange Adventures]]'', ''[[Mystery in Space]]'', ''[[Justice League of America]]'', ''[[The Flash]]'', ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'', and many more.

When [[Carmine Infantino]] came on as DC's art director and then editorial director in 1966/1967, he gradually shifted all of DC's premiere lettering tasks: logos, cover lettering and house ads, from veteran letterer [[Ira Schnapp]] to Saladino. This changed the whole line's look, adding Saladino's bold, dynamic style.,&lt;ref name="klein3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BDS" /&gt; Saladino continued to letter many interior pages as well.

In the late 1960s, while freelancing for DC, Saladino began freelancing for Marvel as well, using the pseudonym '''L.P. Gregory'''&lt;ref name=bails&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bailsprojects.com/bio.aspx?Name=SALADINO%2c+GASPAR | authorlink = Jerry Bails | last = Bails | first= Jerry | first2=Hames, eds. | last2=Ware | publisher = The Who's Who of American Comic Books | title = Saladino, Gaspar | accessdate= August 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lettering titles including ''Iron Man'', ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'' and ''[[Tales to Astonish]]''.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; In the mid-to-late 1970s Saladino became the uncredited "page-one letterer" for many [[Marvel Comics]] titles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2006/08/31/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-66/ Mark Evanier quoted in Brian Cronin's "Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed" #66, Comic Book Resources (Aug. 21, 2006).] Retrieved July 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually credited himself as simply either '''Gaspar''' or '''Gaspar S.'''&lt;ref name=bails /&gt;

In 1976, Saladino lettered the historic DC-Marvel crossover comic ''[[Superman vs. the Amazing Spider-Man]]''. He also lettered the oversize special issue ''[[Superman vs. Muhammad Ali]]''. By 1977, Saladino was lettering most of DC's war comics, in addition to many superhero and mystery stories. From 1976 to 1977, he lettered the [[Los Angeles Times Syndicate]] comic strip ''The Virtue of Vera Valiant'',&lt;ref name=bails /&gt; by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Frank Springer]].

Saladino's output after 2002 was minimal.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

==== Logos ====
[[File:Swthing01.jpg|right|thumb|''Swamp Thing'' #1, featuring Saladino's logo design. Cover art by [[Bernie Wrightson]].]]

Saladino designed the logos for DC's ''[[Swamp Thing]]'', ''[[Vigilante (comics)|Vigilante]]'', ''[[Phantom Stranger]]'', ''[[Metal Men]]'', ''[[Adam Strange]]'', ''[[House of Mystery]]'', ''[[House of Secrets (DC Comics)|House of Secrets]]'', and ''[[Unknown Soldier (DC Comics)|Unknown Soldier]]'', among others.&lt;ref name="BDS"/&gt;&lt;ref name=13-logos&gt;[http://13thdimension.com/13-logos-a-gaspar-saladino-salute/ Images of logos by Saladino for DC and Marvel, confirmed by employees at DC, including Paul Levitz, and by the Grand Comics database]&lt;/ref&gt; He also re-designed established character logos to make them more contemporary and stylish, such as with ''[[Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Green Lantern]]''.&lt;ref name=13-logos/&gt; He also did the lettering for cover blurbs for a wide variety of titles and for seasonal house ads that ran in several issues at a time.&lt;ref name=toddklein1&gt;[http://kleinletters.com/Blog/celebrating-gaspar-saladino/ "All those pieces of art paper with Gaspar's cover lettering were stored in a few bulging folders in a file drawer in the DC production room. When I had time, I went through what was there, mostly from the late 1970s to 1985, and put together these reference pages" -- Todd Klein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toddklein2&gt;[http://kleinletters.com/Blog/celebrating-gaspar-part-2/ "Lots more terrific cover lettering from "The Master," Gaspar Saladino." -- Todd Klein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toddklein3&gt;[http://kleinletters.com/Blog/celebrating-gaspar-part-3/ "Here's the third part of the collection of wonderful cover lettering by Gaspar Saladino that I put together in 1985." -- Todd Klein]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=toddkelin4&gt;[http://kleinletters.com/Blog/celebrating-gaspar-part-4-final/ "This last section of my 1985 collection of stellar cover lettering by the great Gaspar Saladino also includes some from house ads." -- Todd Klein]&lt;/ref&gt;

For Marvel, Saladino's logos, which he either created or updated, include ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'', ''[[Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos]]'', ''[[Captain America and the Falcon]]'', and ''Marvel Triple Action''.&lt;ref name=13-logos/&gt;

In 1974, with the launch of the short-lived publisher [[Seaboard Periodicals|Atlas Comics]], Saladino designed logos for all the company's titles.&lt;ref name=GCD-Seaboard&gt;[http://www.comics.org/publisher/372/ "Gaspar Saladino did all the logos at Atlas" Alan Kupperberg in CBA #16]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s he designed logos for [[Neal Adams]]' [[Continuity Comics]] and for some titles published by [[Eclipse Comics]].&lt;ref name="BDS"/&gt;

In the 1990s he designed product logos for the Lucky Mojo Curio Company, a metaphysical supply manufactory founded by [[Catherine Yronwode]], the former editor-in-chief of Eclipse Comics.

== Lettering style ==
[[File:Saladino's lettering sample.jpg|thumb|left|350px|A panel from ''[[Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth|Arkham Asylum]]'' (story by Grant Morrison, art by Dave McKean), showing Saladino's distinctive lettering treatment.]]

Saladino's default dialoguing style was curvy and naturally enmeshed with the artwork. When producing house ads or cover blurbs, he sometimes altered the standard letterforms in order to interlock letters.&lt;ref name=toddklein3/&gt; One trademark was his use of big, bold, oversized exclamation points.&lt;ref name="BDS"&gt;{{cite web | last = Stroud | first= Bryan | url = http://www.wtv-zone.com/silverager/interviews/saladino.shtml | title = Gaspar Saladino Interview | date = 2007 | publisher = The Silver Age Sage | accessdate = July 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1970s Saladino lettered the interiors for the then-new title ''[[Swamp Thing]]''. It was in the pages of this series that he created the concept of character-designated fonts, with Swamp Thing's distinctive outlined, "drippy" letters.&lt;ref name=evanier-saladino&gt;[http://www.newsfromme.com/2016/08/04/gaspar-saladino-r-p/ "When Swamp Thing by Len Wein and Bernie Wrightson became both a financial and creative success for DC in the seventies, everyone agreed the comic wouldn't be the same without Gaspar's distinctive and expressive lettering." -- Mark Evanier]&lt;/ref&gt;

Saladino always lettered by hand. Likewise, his word balloons were drawn freehand, never with a template.&lt;ref name="BDS" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Saladino and his wife Celeste were married in 1957. At first the couple lived in [[Queens Village]], then moved to a home in [[Plainview, New York|Plainview]], [[Long Island]] in 1959, where they lived the rest of Gaspar's life. They had three children, Greg (born in 1960), Lisa (1962) and Peter (1965). At present there are five grandchildren: Jordan, Brea, Jackson, Alyssa and Kaila.&lt;ref name="klein3" /&gt; In April 2013, he was named honorary chief of the Plainview Fire Department as a 50-year member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Gaspar Saladino, 50-Year-Member, Named 'Honorary Chief' | first = Joe | last = Dowd | date = April 9, 2013 | accessdate = August 19, 2013 | url = http://plainview.patch.com/groups/police-and-fire/p/gaspar-saladino-50-year-member-named-honorary-chief | publisher = Plainview.Patch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Global Studies Consortium''' (GSC) is an international academic association of over 20 institutions of higher learning. It seeks to "promote and facilitate graduate teaching programs in [[global studies]] and to foster cooperation among them." &lt;ref&gt;[http://globalstudiesconsortium.org/info/by-laws By-Laws, Global Studies Consortium]&lt;/ref&gt; That cooperation includes exchange of materials and development of methods to survey outcomes,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EOp0BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA374&amp;lpg=PA374&amp;dq=%22Global+Studies+Consortium%22+Tokyo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=QeBuweU4Ql&amp;sig=80G_Z7C6oucuBMYCq2jAel-63Lk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiiwKbNivHKAhUDRCYKHarRCQg4ChDoAQhBMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Global%20Studies%20Consortium%22%20Tokyo&amp;f=false Lena Bader, et al.

'''Hard science''' and '''soft science''' are [[colloquialism|colloquial]] terms used to compare [[scientific field]]s on the basis of perceived [[Scientific method|methodological rigor]], exactitude, and objectivity.&lt;ref name="Nature 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/4351003a | title = In praise of soft science | journal = Nature | volume = 435 | issue = 7045 | pages = 1003–2005 | year = 2005 | pmid =  15973363| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=Timothy D.|title='Soft' sciences don't deserve the snobbery|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/12/opinion/la-oe-wilson-social-sciences-20120712|accessdate=19 December 2012|newspaper=The Los Angeles Times|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frost nd"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/21stC/issue-1.1/soft.htm| accessdate=10 August 2009| title=Soft science and hard news| publisher=[[Metanews]]| work=[[Columbia University]]| first=Pamela| last=Frost}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly speaking [[natural science]]s (e.g. [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]]) are considered "hard", whereas the [[social science]]s (e.g. [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]]) are usually described as "soft".&lt;ref name="Frost nd" /&gt;

Precise definitions vary,&lt;ref name="Smith2000"/&gt; but features often cited as characteristic of hard science include producing [[Prediction#Prediction in science|testable predictions]], performing [[Scientific control|controlled experiments]], relying on [[Quantification (science)|quantifiable]] data and [[mathematical model]]s, a high degree of accuracy and [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]], higher levels of consensus, faster progression of the field, greater explanatory success, cumulativeness, [[replicability]], and generally applying a purer form of the [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="Wilson 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cole 1983"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cole|first1=Stephen|year=1983|title=The Hierarchy of the Sciences?|journal=American Journal of Sociology|publisher=|volume=89|issue=1|page=111|doi=10.1086/227835|jstor=2779049|citeseerx=10.1.1.1033.9702}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fanelli2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Scientific Uncertainty and Environmental Problem Solving|last=Lemons|first=John|publisher=Blackwell|year=1996|isbn=0865424764|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rose 1997"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/r/rose-lifelines.html|title=Lifelines: Biology Beyond Determinism|last=Rose|first=Steven|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1997|isbn=9780195120356|location=Oxford|chapter=Chapter One}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gutting 2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/17/how-reliable-are-the-social-sciences/|title=How Reliable Are the Social Sciences?|last=Gutting|first=Gary|date=17 May 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diamond 1987"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bama.ua.edu/~sprentic/607%20Diamond%201987.htm|title=Soft sciences are often harder than hard sciences|last=Diamond|first=Jared|date=August 1987|work=Discover|access-date=19 December 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213080212/http://bama.ua.edu/~sprentic/607%20Diamond%201987.htm|archive-date=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hedges|first=Larry|date=1987-05-01|title=How hard is hard science, how soft is soft science?

Some [[Philosophy of science|philosophers]] and [[Sociology of scientific knowledge|sociologists of science]] have questioned the relationship between these characteristics and perceived hardness or softness. The more "developed" hard sciences do not necessarily have a greater degree of [[scientific consensus|consensus]] or selectivity in accepting new results.&lt;ref name="Cole 1983" /&gt; Commonly cited methodological differences are also not a reliable indicator. For example, social sciences such as psychology and sociology use mathematical models extensively, but are usually considered soft sciences.&lt;ref name="Nature 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson 2012" /&gt; However, there are some measurable differences between hard and soft sciences. For example, hard sciences make more [[Graphism thesis|extensive use of graphs]],&lt;ref name="Smith2000"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Representation in scientific practice|last=Latour|first=B.|publisher=MIT Press|year=1990|editor=M. Lynch|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=19–68|chapter=Drawing things together|editor2=S. Woolgar}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soft sciences are more prone to a rapid turnover of [[buzzwords]].&lt;ref name="Bentley 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Bentley|first1=R. A.|year=2008|editor1-last=Allen|editor1-first=Colin|title=Random Drift versus Selection in Academic Vocabulary: An Evolutionary Analysis of Published Keywords|journal=PLoS ONE|volume=3|issue=8|pages=e3057|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003057|pmc=2518107|pmid=18728786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metaphor has been criticised for unduly stigmatizing soft sciences, creating an imbalance in the public perception, funding, and recognition of different fields.&lt;ref name="Wilson 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Frost nd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature 2012" /&gt;

==History of the terms==
The origin of the terms "hard science" and "soft science" is obscure. The earliest attested use of "hard science" is found in an 1858 issue of the ''Journal of the Society of Arts'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Journal|last=Winkworth|first=Thos.|date=1858-10-29|title=Journal of the Society of Arts, Vol. 6, no. 310]|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/41323682.pdf|journal=The Journal of the Society of Arts|pages=697-706}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary |title=hard, adj. and n. |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |edition=3rd |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/84122#eid321123043 |date=June 2015 |year= |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |id= |access-date=2018-08-10}}
&lt;/ref&gt; but the idea of a [[hierarchy of the sciences]] can be found earlier, in the work of the French philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] (1798‒1857). He identified astronomy as the most general science,&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Comte viewed astronomy as studying the physics of the entire cosmos, calling it “celestial physics.” He classified the rest of physics (under the modern definition) as “terrestrial physics,” which was therefore less general.&lt;/ref&gt; followed by physics, chemistry, biology, then sociology. This view was highly influential, and was intended to classify fields based on their degree of intellectual development and the complexity of their subject matter.&lt;ref name="Cole 1983" /&gt;

The modern distinction between hard and soft science is often attributed to an 1964 article published in [[Science (journal)|''Science'']] by [[John R. Platt]]. He explored why he considered some scientific fields to be more productive than others, though he did not actually use the terms themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Platt|first=J. R.|date=1964-10-16|title=Strong Inference: Certain systematic methods of scientific thinking may produce much more rapid progress than others|journal=Science|volume=146|issue=3642|pages=347–353|doi=10.1126/science.146.3642.347|issn=0036-8075|pmid=17739513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=VanLandingham|first=Mark|date=2014|title=On the Hard and Soft Sciences in Public Health|journal=Public Health Reports|volume=129|issue=2|pages=124–126|issn=0033-3549|pmc=3904890|pmid=24587545}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, sociologist of science [[Norman W. Storer]] specifically distinguished between the natural sciences as hard and the social sciences as soft. He defined hardness in terms of the degree to which a field uses mathematics and described a trend of scientific fields increasing in hardness over time, identifying features of increased hardness as including better integration and organization of knowledge, an improved ability to detect errors, and an increase in the difficulty of learning the subject.&lt;ref name="Cole 1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Storer1967"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Storer NW| title=The hard sciences and the soft: some sociological observations. | journal=Bull Med Libr Assoc | year= 1967 | volume= 55 | issue= 1 | pages= 75–84 | doi= | pmc=198502 | pmid= 6016373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empirical support==

Sociologist [[Stephen Cole (sociologist)|Stephen Cole]] conducted a number of empirical studies attempting to find evidence for a hierarchy of scientific disciplines, and was unable to find significant differences in terms of core of knowledge, degree of codification, or research material. Differences that he did find evidence for included a tendency for textbooks in soft sciences to rely on more recent work, while the material in textbooks from the hard sciences was more consistent over time.&lt;ref name="Cole 1983"/&gt; However, it has been suggested that Cole might have missed some relationships in the data because he studied individual measurements, without accounting for the way multiple measurements could trend in the same direction, and because not all the criteria that could indicate a discipline’s scientific status were analysed.&lt;ref name="Simonton 2004"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Simonton DK| title=Psychology’s Status as a Scientific Discipline: Its Empirical Placement Within an Implicit Hierarchy of the Sciences. | journal=Review of General Psychology | year= 2004 | volume= 8 | issue= 1 | pages= 59–67 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.8.1.59| url= http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/gpr/8/1/59.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cleveland 1984 performed a survey of 57 journals and found that natural science journals used many more graphs than journals in mathematics or social science, and that social science journals often presented large amounts of observational data in the absence of graphs. The amount of page area used for graphs ranged from 0% to 31%, and the variation was primarily due to the number of graphs included rather than their sizes.&lt;ref name="Cleveland1984"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Cleveland WS| title=Graphs in Scientific Publications | journal=The American Statistician| year= 1984 | volume= 38 | issue= 4 | pages= 261–269 | doi=10.2307/2683400 | jstor= 2683400}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Further analyses by Smith in 2000,&lt;ref name="Smith2000"/&gt; based on samples of graphs from journals in seven major scientific disciplines, found that the amount of graph usage correlated "almost perfectly" with hardness (r=0.97). They also suggested that the hierarchy applies with individual fields, and demonstrated the same result using ten subfields of psychology (r=0.93).&lt;ref name="Smith2000"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Smith LD, Best LA, Stubbs A, Johnston J, Archibald AB |title=Scientific Graphs and the Hierarchy of the Sciences |journal=Social Studies of Science |year= 2000 |volume= 30 |issue= 1 |pages= 73–94 |doi= 10.1177/030631200030001003|url=http://sss.sagepub.com/content/30/1/73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fanelli 2010 proposed that we expect more positive outcomes in "softer" sciences because there are fewer constraints on researcher bias. They found that among research papers that tested a hypothesis, the frequency of positive results was predicted by the perceived hardness of the field. For example, the social sciences as a whole had a 2.3-fold increased odds of positive results compared to the physical sciences, with the biological sciences in between. They added that this supported the idea that the social sciences and natural sciences differ only in degree, as long as the social sciences follow the scientific approach.&lt;ref name="Fanelli2010"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Fanelli D| title="Positive" results increase down the Hierarchy of the Sciences. | journal=PLOS ONE | year= 2010 | volume= 5 | issue= 4 | pages= e10068 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0010068 | pmc=2850928 | pmid= 20383332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fanelli 2013 tested whether the ability of researchers in a field to "achieve consensus and accumulate knowledge" increases with the hardness of the science, and sampled 29,000 papers from 12 disciplines using measurements that indicate the degree of scholarly consensus. Out of the three possibilities (hierarchy, hard/soft distinction, or no ordering), the results supported a hierarchy, with physical sciences performing the best followed by biological sciences and then social sciences. The results also held within disciplines, as well as when mathematics and the humanities were included.&lt;ref name="Fanelli2013"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fanelli D, Glänzel W | title=Bibliometric Evidence for a Hierarchy of the Sciences. | journal=PLOS ONE | year= 2013 | volume= 8 | issue= 6 | pages= e66938 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0066938 | pmc=3694152 | pmid= 23840557}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Critics of the concept argue that soft sciences are implicitly considered to be less "legitimate" scientific fields,&lt;ref name="Wilson 2012" /&gt; or simply not scientific at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berezow|first=Alex B.|title=Why psychology isn't science |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/opinion-la/la-ol-blowback-pscyhology-science-20120713,0,1641705.story |accessdate=19 December 2012 |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |date=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' stated that social science findings are more likely to intersect with everyday experience and may be dismissed as "obvious or insignificant" as a result.&lt;ref name="Nature 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/487271a | title = A different agenda | journal = Nature | volume = 487 | issue = 7407 | pages = 271 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Being labelled a soft science can affect the perceived value of a discipline to society and the amount of funding available to it.&lt;ref name="Frost nd" /&gt; In the 1980s, mathematician [[Serge Lang]] successfully blocked influential political scientist [[Samuel P.

'''Harvard Student Agencies, Inc.''' ('''HSA''') is the largest student-run company in the world, employing more than 500 Harvard undergraduates annually. Founded in 1957, HSA is a multimillion-dollar non-profit that provides [[Harvard University]] students with meaningful opportunities for employment and hands-on business education. Student managers lead all aspects of the operations and strategy behind HSA's 15 businesses, which range from publishing to tutoring to bartending, including [[Let's Go (book series)|Let's Go]] (the leader in student travel), HSA Cleaners (a laundry and dry-cleaning service), and The Harvard Shop (a storefront and web retail business).

HSA is a [[501(c)(3)]] nonprofit, and was founded to help defray rising tuition costs while providing practical business experience for Harvard undergraduates and supplying services to the campus community.

HSA is headquartered in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]].

==History==

===Founding===
HSA was founded in 1957 on the ideal of financing education through student employment. With Harvard's tuition on the rise, members of the Financial Aid Office were concerned that the increased cost of higher education would adversely affect the social and economic make-up of those applying to Harvard. At the same time, some ambitious students were running small-scale businesses out of their dorm rooms.  John Munro, Dean of Financial Aid, assigned Dustin M. Burke, Director of Student Employment, to investigate student businesses as a possible source of financial aid and to begin developing the idea that would become Harvard Student Agencies.

Later that spring, a meeting with student managers revealed considerable interest in the idea of a corporation, and more concrete plans began to emerge. With an initial capital investment of $7,000 and the acquisition of the rights to provide the weekly linen service traditionally offered by the university, HSA was equipped to carry its corporate overhead. The remaining pieces quickly fell into place. In August 1957, the papers authorizing a new company were filed. On September 10, the new corporation's first meeting was held. On December 13, 1957, the charter was signed recognizing the six original incorporators: John Munro, Dustin Burke, Greg Stone, John Giannetti, Theodore Elliot, and [[Harold Rosenwald]].&lt;ref name="hsa.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsa.net/history/|title=History|website=Harvard Student Agencies|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the company has grown significantly over the past 6 decades. Let's Go publishing was the leading agency for much of 1980s and 1990s, at one point publishing over 50 titles annually. With the recent decline in publishing travel, however, The Harvard Shop has become the largest operation for the Harvard Student Agencies. With a robust E-commerce presence as well as three physical locations in the square, it aims to serve tourists, locals, and students alike.&lt;ref name="hsa.net"/&gt; The company has expanded organically and through acquiring startups that align with the company's mission. Recent examples include Mount Auburn Productions, created to meet the demand for live event filming and photography on campus, as well as College Copywriters, a startup that was acquired by Harvard Student Agencies in 2015 that connected students to companies needing high quality copy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/10/22/hsa-scrutiny-silber/|title=There's an Agency for That - Magazine - The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HSA Headquarters: Burke-McCoy Hall==
HSA Headquarters is located at 67 Mount Auburn Street, Cambridge MA, in the former [[Manter Hall School]] building which was built in 1927. Established in 1884, Manter Hall School helped students prepare for Harvard's entrance exams during the 1930s and offered four- and eight-hour review sessions before every major Harvard mid-term and final examination. Although enrollment reached a peak of 250 in the late 1940s, by 1994 only 19 students were registered. At this time, Robert Hall, the owner of the building and manager of the school for 57 years, turned 83 and began talking to Harvard Student Agencies. Mr. Hall came to understand the unique educational opportunities HSA afforded to students and decided to sell the property to HSA in the spring of 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1995/2/10/hsa-finds-permanent-location-in-square/|title=HSA Finds Permanent Location In Square - News - The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1995, Robert W. McCoy (Harvard College ‘62, [[Harvard Business School]] ‘65) pledged a substantial lead gift to HSA’s capital campaign. The building was dedicated as Burke-McCoy Hall on February 5, 1997, and the dream of a permanent home for HSA was a reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1996/12/11/hsa-lets-go-move-to-67/|title=HSA, Let's Go Move To 67 Mt. Auburn St. - News - The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building was named in honor of Dustin M. Burke, the first General Manager of HSA (1957-1970); Hester Bell McCoy, who joined HSA in 1961 as the company’s secretary; and Robert McCoy, Manager of Europe-by-Car, Assistant General Manager to Dusty Burke, and Let’s Go business manager upon his graduation from business school.

HSA currently occupies the top three floors and basement of Burke-McCoy Hall. Bank of America, Boloco (formerly The Wrap) and HSA Cleaners occupy the retail level of Burke-McCoy Hall. Behind the building, enough space exists to accommodate construction of a substantial annex for future expansion. A recent partnership with CS50, the introductory computer science course with one of the largest enrollments at Harvard, has opened the third floor to hosting office hours for students and teaching fellows to meet and congregate. This additional option was created in response to increasing demand for office hours as a result of the size of the course, as well the offer more flexible office hours to fit the wide range of schedules from students taking the class. The partnership also seeks to give students the option to pursue projects related services for students, with room for collaboration with Harvard Student Agencies beyond the one semester course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/9/14/CS50-expands-to-HSA/|title=CS50 Expands Office Hour Locations to HSA - News - The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HSA also has three locations of The Harvard Shop in Harvard Square at 52 JFK Street, 65 Mt. Auburn Street and 34 JFK Street.

'''Heritage interpretation''' refers to all the ways in which information is communicated to visitors to an educational, natural or recreational site, such as a museum, park or science centre. More specifically it is the communication of information about, or the explanation of, the nature, origin, and purpose of historical, natural, or cultural resources, objects, sites and phenomena using personal or non-personal methods.  Some international authorities in [[museology]] prefer the term '''mediation''' for the same concept, following usage in other European languages.

Heritage interpretation may be performed at dedicated [[interpretation centres]] or at [[museum]]s, historic sites, [[parks]], art galleries, nature centres, [[zoos]], [[Public aquarium|aquaria]], [[botanical gardens]], nature reserves and a host of other heritage sites. Its modalities can be extremely varied and may include [[guided walks]], [[Speech|talks]], [[drama]], staffed stations, displays, signs, labels, artwork, brochures, interactives, audio-guides and audio-visual media. The process of developing a structured approach to interpreting these stories, messages and information is called [[interpretive planning]]. The [[Thematic interpretation|thematic approach]] to heritage interpretation advocated by University of Idaho professor Sam Ham, the [[National Association for Interpretation]], the US [[National Park Service]], and others, is considered best practice.&lt;ref name="Brochu (2003)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brochu|first=Lisa|title=Interpretive planning|year=2003|publisher=InterpPress|location=Fort Collins, CO|isbn=1-879931-12-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brochu &amp; Merriman (2002)"&gt;{{cite book|last=Brochu|first=Lisa|title=Personal Interpretation: Connecting Your Audience to Heritage Resources|year=2002|publisher=InterpPress|location=Fort Collins, CO|isbn=1-879931-06-0|author2=Merriman, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Caputo et al.

Those who practice this form of interpretation may include [[park ranger|rangers]], [[guide]]s, [[Natural history|naturalists]], [[actors]] (who may wear period dress and do reenactments), museum curators, natural and cultural interpretive specialists, interpretation officers, heritage communicators, [[Museum docent|docents]], [[educators]], visitor services staff, interpreters or a host of other titles.

The goal of interpretation is to improve and enrich the visitor experience by helping site visitors understand the significance of the place they are visiting, and connecting those meanings to visitors' own personal lives.&lt;ref name="NPSNR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/bulletins/interp/int4.htm|title=Telling the Stories, Part 4: National Register of Historic Places Bulletin|first=Jeff|last=Joeckel|date=1 February 2002|website=nps.gov|accessdate=24 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180126185330/https://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/bulletins/interp/int4.htm|archivedate=26 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By weaving compelling, thematic stories about environmental phenomena and historical events, interpreters aim to provoke visitors to learn and think about their experiences.
Effective interpretation enables the visitors to make associations between the information given and their previous perceptions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Moscardo, G.(1996) [http://www.depts.ttu.edu/MuseumTTU/CFASWebsite/H7000%20folder/Readings%20Heritage%20Tourism%202010/H%20tourism_mindfule%20visitors_Moscardo.pdf Mindful Visitors: Heritage and Tourism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117031942/http://www.depts.ttu.edu/MuseumTTU/CFASWebsite/H7000%20folder/Readings%20Heritage%20Tourism%202010/H%20tourism_mindfule%20visitors_Moscardo.pdf |date=2015-11-17 }}, Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Staiff(2014)"&gt;{{ cite book|last= Staiff|first= Russel|title=Re-imagining Heritage Interpretation: Enchanting the Past-future|year=2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Moscardo&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; interpretation can produce 'Mindful Visitors' who are carefully processing information and negotiating the meanings of the observed object or intangible element.

Interpretation is often used by landowning government agencies and NGOs to promote [[environmental stewardship]] of the lands they manage.

== "Tilden's principles" of interpretation ==

In his 1957 book, "Interpreting Our Heritage", [[Freeman Tilden]] defined six principles of interpretation:
{{quote|
# Any interpretation that does not somehow relate what is being displayed or described to something within the personality or experience of the visitor will be sterile.
# Information, as such, is not Interpretation. Interpretation is revelation based upon information. But they are entirely different things. However all interpretation includes information.
# Interpretation is an art, which combines many arts, whether the materials presented are scientific, historical or architectural. Any art is in some degree teachable.
# The chief aim of Interpretation is not instruction, but provocation.
# Interpretation should aim to present a whole rather than a part, and must address itself to the whole man rather than any phase.
# Interpretation addressed to children (say up to the age of twelve) should not be a dilution of the presentation to adults, but should follow a fundamentally different approach. To be at its best it will require a separate program.}}

For the past 50 years, Tilden's principles have remained highly relevant to interpreters across the world. In 2002 Larry Beck and Ted Cable published "Interpretation for the 21st Century - Fifteen Guiding Principles for Interpreting Nature and Culture", which elaborated upon Tilden's original principles. In 2011, Beck and Cable released a new version of their principles in "The Gift of Interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;Beck, L, Cable,T. (2011) ''The Gifts of Interpretation: Fifteen guiding principles for interpreting nature and culture''.

[[File:M73 13.jpg|thumb|''The Fall of Babylon'', [[engraving]] by [[Jean Duvet]] from the ''Apocalypse'' series, circa 1555, plate size: 11 ⅞ x 8 ⅜ in.]]

In [[visual art]], '''horror vacui''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒ|r|ər|_|ˈ|v|ɑː|k|juː|aɪ}}; from [[Latin]] "fear of empty space"), also '''kenophobia''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] "fear of the empty"),&lt;ref&gt;Lesley Brown: ''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary''. Vol.&amp;nbsp;1:&amp;nbsp;A−M. [[Oxford University Press|Clarendon Press]], Oxford 1993, p.360&lt;/ref&gt; is the filling of the entire surface of a space or an [[Work of art|artwork]] with [[Complexity|detail]].&lt;ref&gt;[[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/horror%20vacui]] horror vacui as defined in the Merriam Webster Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The term is associated with the Italian art critic and scholar [[Mario Praz]], who used it to describe the suffocating atmosphere and clutter of interior design in the [[Victorian age]].&lt;ref name="Lidwell-Holden"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lidwell|first=William, and Kritina Holden, Jill Butler|title=Universal Principles of Design, Revised and Updated: 125 Ways to Enhance Usability, Influence Perception, Increase Appeal, Make Better Design Decisions, and Teach through Design|year=2010|publisher=Rockport Publishers|location=Beverly, Massachusetts|isbn=1592535879|pages=128–9|url=https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-Revised-Updated/dp/1592535879}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older, and more artistically esteemed examples can be seen on [[Migration period art]] objects like the [[carpet page]]s of [[Insular art|Insular]] illuminated manuscripts such as the [[Book of Kells]]. This feeling of meticulously filling empty spaces also permeates [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]] Islamic art from ancient times to the present. Another example comes from ancient Greece during the [[Geometric Art|Geometric Age]] (1100 - 900 BCE), when horror vacui was considered a stylistic element of all art. The mature work of the French Renaissance engraver [[Jean Duvet]] consistently exhibits horror vacui.

==Examples==
Some examples of horror vacui in art come from, or are influenced by, the [[mentally ill|mentally unstable]] and inmates of [[psychiatric hospitals]], such as [[Richard Dadd]] in the 19th century, and many modern examples fall under the category of [[Outsider Art]]. {{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Horror vacui may have also had an impact, consciously or unconsciously, on [[graphic design]] by artists like [[David Carson (graphic designer)|David Carson]] or [[Vaughan Oliver]], and in the [[underground comix]] movement in the work of [[S. Clay Wilson]], [[Robert Crumb]], [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]], and on later comic artists such as [[Mark Beyer (comics)|Mark Beyer]]. The paintings of Williams, [[Faris Badwan]], Emerson Barrett, [[Joe Coleman (painter)|Joe Coleman]] and [[Todd Schorr]] are further examples of horror vacui in the modern [[Lowbrow (art movement)|Lowbrow]] art movement.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

The [[entheogen]]-inspired [[visionary art]] of certain [[indigenous peoples]], such as the [[Huichol people|Huichol]] yarn paintings and the [[ayahuasca]]-inspired art of [[Pablo Amaringo]], often exhibits this style, as does the [[psychedelic art]] movement of the [[1960s counterculture]]. Sometimes the patterned art in clothing of indigenous peoples of Middle and South America exhibits horror vacui. For example, the geometric [[Mola (art form)|molas]] of [[Kuna (people)|Kuna]] people and the traditional clothing on [[Shipibo-Conibo]] people.

The artwork in the [[Where's Wally?]] series of children's books is a commonly known example of horror vacui, as are many of the small books written or illustrated by the macabre imagination of [[Edward Gorey]].

The [[Tingatinga (painting)|Tingatinga]] painting style of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania is a contemporary example of horror vacui. Other African artists such as Malangatana of Mozambique ([[Malangatana Ngwenya]]) also fill the canvas in this way.

The arrangement of [[Ancient Egyptian]] [[hieroglyphs]] suggests an abhorrence of empty space. Signs are repeated or [[phonetic complement]]s added to prevent gaps.

Horror vacui also strikes mapmakers. In the times of the [[Age of Discovery|Discoveries]], for instance, it was common for cartographers to fill in the ''[[Terra incognita]]'' or the poorly known oceans with [[Sea monster|monsters]] or simply with the [[Scale (map)|scale]] of the map, rather than to leave them blank.

==Current usage and meaning==
{{double image|right|Only Two Colours.jpg|150|Mango store in Barcelona.jpg|150|''Horror vacui'' and value perception}}
There is an inverse relationship between ''horror vacui'' and value perception, and commercial designers favour [[minimalism]] in shop window displays and advertising to appeal to affluent and well-educated consumers, on the premise that understatement and restraint appeals more to affluent and well-educated audiences.&lt;ref name="Lidwell-Holden" /&gt;


==Analogy==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
The term is also used as an analogy to the [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] [[Horror vacui (physics)|idea]] that a physical vacuum is impossible, and therefore the idea must be rejected.  This was widely believed up to the time of [[Rene Descartes]].

{{Atheism sidebar|types}}

'''Implicit atheism''' and '''explicit atheism''' are types of [[atheism]].&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; In [[George H. Smith]]'s ''Atheism: The Case Against God'', "implicit atheism" is defined as "the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it",  while "explicit atheism" is "the absence of theistic belief due to a conscious rejection of it".&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/smith.htm |title=Atheism: The Case Against God |first=George H. |last=Smith |location=Buffalo, New York |year=1979 |publisher=Prometheus |isbn=0-87975-124-X |pages=13–18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000831235652/http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/smith.htm |archivedate=2000-08-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Explicit atheists have considered the idea of [[Deity|deities]] and have rejected belief that any exist. Implicit atheists, though they do not themselves maintain a belief in a god or gods, have not rejected the notion or have not considered it further.

== Implicit atheism ==
"Implicit atheism" is "the absence of theistic belief without a conscious rejection of it". "Absence of theistic belief" encompasses all forms of non-belief in deities. This would categorize as implicit atheists those adults who have never heard of the concept of deities, and those adults who have not given the idea any real consideration. Also included are agnostics who assert they do not believe in any deities (even if they claim not to be atheists), and children.  As far back as 1772, [[Baron d'Holbach]] said that "All children are born Atheists; they have no idea of God".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=d'Holbach |first=P. H. T. |authorlink=Baron d'Holbach |title=Good Sense |year=1772 |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/7319 |accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith is silent on newborn children, but clearly identifies as atheists some children who are unaware of any concept of any deity:
{{Quote
 | The man who is unacquainted with theism is an atheist because he does not believe in a god. This category would also include the child with the conceptual capacity to grasp the issues involved, but who is still unaware of those issues. The fact that this child does not believe in god qualifies him as an atheist.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;
}}

== Explicit atheism ==
Smith observes that some motivations for explicit atheism are rational and some not. Of the rational motivations, he says:
{{Quote
 | The most significant variety of atheism is explicit atheism of a philosophical nature. This atheism contends that the belief in god is irrational and should therefore be rejected. Since this version of explicit atheism rests on a criticism of theistic beliefs, it is best described as ''critical atheism''.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;
}}

For Smith, critical, explicit atheism is subdivided further into three groups:&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;{{ssup|&amp;nbsp;p.17}}
# the view usually expressed by the statement "I do not believe in the existence of a god or supernatural being" after "the failure of theism to provide sufficient evidence in its favor. Faced with a lack of evidence, this explicit atheist sees no reason whatsoever for believing in a supernatural being";
# the view usually expressed by the statement "God does not exist" or "the existence of God is impossible" after "a particular concept of god, such as the God of Christianity, is judged to be absurd or contradictory";
# the view which "refuses to discuss the existence or nonexistence of a god" because "the concept of a 'god' is unintelligible".

For the purposes of his paper on "philosophical atheism", [[Ernest Nagel]] chose to attach only the explicit atheism definition for his examination and discussion:
{{Quote
 | I must begin by stating what sense I am attaching to the word "atheism," and how I am construing the theme of this paper. I shall understand by "atheism" a critique and a denial of the major claims of all varieties of theism. [...] atheism is not to be identified with sheer unbelief, or with disbelief in some particular creed of a religious group. Thus, a child who has received no religious instruction and has never heard about God, is not an atheist – for he is not denying any theistic claims. Similarly in the case of an adult who, if he has withdrawn from the faith of his father without reflection or because of frank indifference to any theological issue, is also not an atheist – for such an adult is not challenging theism and not professing any views on the subject. [...] I propose to examine some ''philosophic'' concepts of atheism...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Basic Beliefs: The Religious Philosophies of Mankind |chapter=Philosophical Concepts of Atheism |first=Ernest |last=Nagel |authorlink=Ernest Nagel |year=1959 |publisher=Sheridan House}}&lt;br/&gt;reprinted in ''Critiques of God'', edited by Peter A. Angeles, Prometheus Books, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Nagel's ''Philosophical Concepts of Atheism'', he very much agrees with Smith on the three-part subdivision of "explicit atheism" above, though Nagel does not use the term "explicit".

== Other typologies of atheism ==
{{further|Atheism#Definitions and distinctions}}

The specific narrow focus on [[Negative and positive atheism|positive atheism]] taken by some professional philosophers like Nagel on the one hand, compared with the scholarship on traditional negative atheism of freethinkers like [[Baron d'Holbach|d'Holbach]] and Smith on the other has been attributed to the different concerns of professional philosophers and layman proponents of atheism, {{Quote| "If so many atheists and some of their critics have insisted on the negative definition of atheism, why have some modern philosophers called for a positive definition of atheism -- atheism as the outright denial of God's existence? Part of the reason, I suspect, lies in the chasm separating freethinkers and academic philosophers. Most modern philosophers are totally unfamiliar with atheistic literature and so remain oblivious to the tradition of negative atheism contained in that literature. (see Smith (1990, Chapter 3, p.&amp;nbsp;51-60&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/smithdef.htm |title=Atheism, Ayn Rand, and Other Heresies |last=Smith |first=George H. |year=1990 |pages=51–60 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080713012926/http://www.positiveatheism.org/writ/smithdef.htm |archivedate=2008-07-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;))}}

Everitt (2004) makes the point that professional philosophers are more interested in the grounds for giving or withholding assent to propositions:
&lt;blockquote&gt; We need to distinguish between a ''biographical'' or ''sociological'' enquiry into why some people have believed or disbelieved in God, and an ''[[epistemological]]'' enquiry into whether there are any good reasons for either belief or unbelief... We are interested in the question of what ''good reasons'' there are for or against God's existence, and no light is thrown on that question by discovering people who hold their beliefs without having good reasons for them.&lt;ref&gt;Everitt, Nicholas, ''The Non-existence of God: An Introduction''. London: Routledge, 2004 ({{ISBN|0-415-30107-6}}), p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

So, sometimes in philosophy (Flew, Martin and Nagel notwithstanding), only the explicit "denial of theistic belief" is examined, rather than the broader, implicit subject of atheism.

The terms [[Weak and strong atheism|"weak atheism" and "strong atheism"]], also known as "negative atheism" and "positive atheism", are usually used by Smith as synonyms of the less well-known "implicit" and "explicit" categories. "Strong explicit" atheists assert that it is false that any deities exist. "Weak explicit" atheists assert they do not believe in deities, and do not assert it is ''true'' that deities do not exist. Those who do not believe any deities exist, and do not assert their non-belief are included among implicit atheists. Among weak implicit atheists are included the following: children and adults who have never heard of deities; people who have heard of deities but have never given the idea any considerable thought; and those agnostics who suspend belief about deities, but do not reject such belief.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

The '''International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation, and Engineering''' (ISNSCE, pronounced like "essence"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Erik Winfree Homepage|url=http://www.dna.caltech.edu/~winfree/|publisher=Winfree Laboratory, California Institute of Technology|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[scientific society]] specializing in [[nanotechnology]] and [[DNA computing]].  It was started in 2004 by [[Nadrian Seeman]], founder of the field of [[DNA nanotechnology]].  According to the society, its purpose is "to promote the study of the control of the arrangement of the atoms in matter, examine the principles that lead to such control, to develop tools and methods to increase such control, and to investigate the use of these principles for molecular computation, and for engineering on the finest possible scales."&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=About ISNSCE|url=http://www.isnsce.org/about|publisher=International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation, and Engineering|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.isnsce.org/about/history|publisher=International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation, and Engineering|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISNSCE sponsors two [[academic conference]]s each year: the first is Foundations of Nanoscience (FNANO), and the second is the International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Computation (DNA Computing).&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;  The FNANO conference has been held in [[Snowbird, Utah]] each year in April since 2004, and focuses on [[molecular self-assembly]] of nanoscale materials and devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview|url=http://www.cs.duke.edu/FNANO/overview.html|publisher=Duke University|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DNA Computing focuses on [[biomolecular computing]] and DNA nanotechnology, and has been held annually since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming|url=http://www.dna-computing.org/|publisher=International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[proceedings]] of DNA Computing are published as part of the [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] book series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Published proceedings|url=http://www.dna-computing.org/proceedings.html|publisher=International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
ISNSCE sponsors two awards annually.  The ISNSCE Nanoscience Prize recognizes research in any area of nanoscience, and has been presented at FNANO each year since 2007.  The Tulip Award in DNA Computing is specific to the fields of biomolecular computing and molecular programming, and has been presented at the DNA Computing conference since 2000.  ISNSCE also sponsors two student awards for papers presented at the DNA Computing conference each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISNCSE Awards|url=http://www.isnsce.org/awards|publisher=International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation, and Engineering|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tulip Award was first given at the sixth DNA Computing conference, in [[Leiden]], the Netherlands, whose [[Leiden Botanical Garden|botanical garden]] is known as the birthplace of the [[Tulip mania|tulip culture]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DNA6: Sixth International Meeting on DNA Based Computers|url=http://www.lcnc.nl/dna6/dna-booklet.doc|publisher=Leiden Center for Natural Computing|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tulip"/&gt;

In April 2015, ISNCSE established the [[Robert Dirks]] Molecular Programming Prize to recognize early-career scientists for molecular programming research.  The award was established in memory of Dirks, who was one of the six fatalities of the February 2015 [[Valhalla train crash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blog.wabash.edu/alumninews/2015/05/01/robert-dirks-00-memorial-prize-announced/|title = Robert Dirks ’00 memorial prize announced|date = 1 May 2015|accessdate = 5 May 2015|website = |publisher = Wabash College|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ecological restoration of islands''', or '''island restoration''', is the application of the principles of [[ecological restoration]] to [[island]]s and island groups. Islands, due to their isolation, are home to many of the world's [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species, as well as important breeding grounds for [[seabird]]s and some [[marine mammal]]s. Their ecosystems are also very vulnerable to human [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] and particularly to [[introduced species]], due to their small size. Island groups such as [[New Zealand]] and [[Hawaii]] have undergone substantial [[extinction]]s and losses of [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]. Since the 1950s several organisations and government agencies around the world have worked to restore islands to their original states; New Zealand has used them to hold natural populations of species that would otherwise be unable to survive in the wild. The principal components of island restoration are the removal of introduced species and the reintroduction of native species.

==Islands, endemism and extinction==
Isolated islands have been known to have greater levels of endemism since the 1970s when the theory of [[Island biogeography]], formulated by  [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[E.O. Wilson]] was developed. This higher occurrence of endemism is because isolation limits immigration of new species to the island, allowing new species to evolve separately from others on the mainland. For example, 71% of [[Biodiversity of New Zealand|New Zealand]]'s bird species (prior to human arrival) were endemic. As well as displaying greater levels of endemism, island species have characteristics that make them particularly vulnerable to human disturbance.

Many island species evolved on small islands, or even restricted habitats on small islands. Small populations are vulnerable to even modest hunting, and restricted habitats are vulnerable to loss or modification of said habitat. More importantly, island species are often ecologically naive, that is they have not evolved alongside a predator, or have lost appropriate behavioural responses to [[predator]]s. This often resulted in flightlessness, or unusual levels of [[island tameness|tameness]]. This made many species susceptible to hunting (it is thought, for example, that [[moa]]s were hunted to extinction in a few short generations) and to predation by introduced species. Some, such as the [[dodo]], are thought to have become extinct because of the pressure of both humans and introduced animals. One estimate of birds in the [[Pacific]] islands puts the extinctions at 2000 species. Between 40 and 50% of the bird species of New Zealand have become extinct since 200 AD.

[[Image:Takahe and chick.jpg|thumb|230px|right|[[Takahe]] have bred after translocation to restored islands, like these on [[Kapiti Island]].]]
The field of island restoration is usually credited with having been started in New Zealand in the 1960s, but other smaller projects, such as the restoration of [[Nonsuch Island]] in [[Bermuda]] (which began in 1962) have been going on for almost as long. Nevertheless, the program undertaken by the [[New Zealand Department of Conservation|Department of Conservation]] (DOC) is one of the largest in the world. It began on [[Cuvier Island]], where ecologists removed stock, [[goat]]s, [[feral cats]] and finally, in 1993, [[Pacific rat]]s. The success of the project resulted in similar projects around New Zealand. The advantages to the DOC were considerable; in addition to protecting species endemic to smaller islands, like the [[magenta petrel]], islands near the mainland, once restored, could act as habitat for species of birds that were unable to survive on the mainland. Species like the [[takahe]], where the remaining wild population was at considerable risk from feral cats and dogs, could be moved to these islands to safeguard the species.

===Eradication of introduced alien species===
One important aspect of island restoration is the removal of [[invasive species|invasive alien species]]. Since these species are most often the reason that native fauna and flora is threatened, their removal is essential to the restoration project. From 1673 until 2009, 786 successful invasive vertebrate eradication have been recorded and in the last few decades the frequency of eradications and the size of islands from which invasive vertebrates have been eradicated has increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Islands Invasive Vertebrate Eradication Database: A tool to improve and facilitate restoration of island ecosystems.|url=http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/people/croll/pdf/Keitt_2011.pdf|publisher=[[International Union for Conservation of Nature|International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)]]|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islands are particularly suitable for restoration as once cleared of an introduced species they can be kept cleared of these species by virtue of being an island. Species removal is intensive and expensive, and methods used must be carefully chosen as to not create too much impact on non-target species. Feral cats, goats and three species of rats are among the most damaging species introduced to islands (Moors &amp; Atkinson 1984). The differences in size, lifestyle and behaviour preclude the use of the same techniques for all of them, but with many species a range of techniques needs to be used in order to ensure success. Larger animals, such as goats and pigs, can be effectively hunted; in the case of [[Round Island (Mauritius)|Round Island]], in [[Mauritius]], all the goats were eliminated by a single marksman. On larger islands ecologists use a [[Judas goat]], where a radio collared goat is released into the wild. This goat is then followed and groups it joins are removed. To remove cats a combination of techniques is needed: hunting, trapping and poisoning. Cats are more difficult to hunt than goats and pigs, requiring the use of experienced hunters and night hunting.

Trapping is ineffective for rats, given their sheer numbers, and the only method that works is [[poison]]ing, which can be delivered into the field by broadcasting (by hand or from the air) or by the maintenance of bait stations. This method has been employed around the world, in the [[Falkland Islands]], in the tropical Pacific, and off New Zealand, where over 40 islands have been cleared. This method is not without problems, especially if the rats share the island with other, native species of rodent that might take the bait as well, as has happened on [[Anacapa Island]] in the [[Channel Islands of California|Channel Islands]] and Rat Island ([[Hawadax Island|Hawadax]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.seabirdrestoration.org/pdf/RatIslandReview.pdf|title=THE RAT ISLAND RAT ERADICATION PROJECT: A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF NONTARGET MORTALITY.

In the Pacific poison intended for rats was taken by land [[crab]]s instead; the crabs were not affected by the poison but frustrated attempts to clear the rats.

The removal of invasive [[weed]]s is, in most cases, more difficult than removing animal species. One such eradication was that of [[sandbur]], ''Cencrus echinatus'', an introduced [[grass]] on [[Laysan]]. The grass, introduced to Laysan around 1961, had taken over 30% of the island by 1991, displaced the native [[bunchgrass]], and reduced the breeding habitat of two endemic threatened species, the [[Laysan duck]] and [[Laysan finch]], as well as those of several [[seabird]]s.  The removal took ten years, with controlled spraying for the first year, then individual removal of plants, then, when few plants were being found, sifting of the sands around plants to remove seeds. The cost of the eradication program was $150,000/year.

====Strategies====

There are three strategies to reduce the numbers of the introduced animals in order to lighten the problems caused by them: exclusion, control, and eradication.
Exclusion is removal of introduced species in limited areas and focused on a local impact.
Control has a meaning of mitigation by reducing the numbers of introduced species down to ecologically and economically less harmful level. Since it is not complete wiping out strategy, this has to be taken constantly and repeatedly. This strategy is said to be feasible but less cost effective due to its incompleteness.
Eradication is the complete removal of all the individuals of the population, down to the last potentially reproducing individual, or the reduction of their population density below sustainable levels&lt;ref&gt;Myers, J. H., Simberloff, D., Kuris, A.  M. &amp; Carey, J. R. (2000). Eradication revisited : dealing with exotic species. Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution 15, 316–320.&lt;/ref&gt; ( J. H. Myerset al., 2000). For islands, it is usually the best strategy as it gives permanent effects, which potentially means most cost effective. However, it is still logistically and economically high cost. Also, this strategy is sometimes hard to accomplish depending on the environment of island and the alien species.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Courchamp, F., Chapuis, J., and Pascal, M. (2003). Mammal invaders on islands: impact, control and control impact. Cambridge Philosophical Society. 78, 347-383.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methods====

Fencing is used for excluding the alien mammals. This method intends to limit the area for the mammals before control or eradication.
Shooting is often used for large animals to control them. This method has meanings of gaining food supply and recreation. It requires accessibility in the field and experience for the hunters. Also, to maintain the effect, it requires good amount of manpower for long time, so it can be costly.
Trapping is designed for medium-sized mammals which are hard to shoot at.  This method is usually only for reduction not eradication. The advantage of this method is that it can be selective since it is possible to exclude or reduce the possibility of trapping native animals. However, trapping requires limited area to cover and limited population to capture.

Poisoning is very effective for small species. However, there are some disadvantages of this method. It is possible that untargeted animals take the poison. It is also necessary to consider the secondary poisoning that other animals are affected by poisoned species. This method can be costly if the area to cover is large.&lt;ref name=tny20141223&gt;
{{cite news |last1=Kolbert|first1=Elizabeth |title=The Big Kill : New Zealand's crusade to rid itself of mammals |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/12/22/big-kill |accessdate=23 December 2014 |work=The New Yorker |date=23 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pathogen Introduction (parasitism) is one of the biological methods to eradicate alien species. It is very effective for limited species, but the viruses and bacteria need to be specified clearly for use.&lt;ref name=tny20141223/&gt;

Predator introduction is another biological method to eradicate the introduced species. It is less costly and environmentally clean, but it can cause greater problems, because it is possible that the introduced predator targets the native animals instead of alien species and its existence and its parasites can be new problems.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Competitor introduction is also a biological method to eradicate introduced carnivores. It can be very effective with good amount of information. In the end, the competitor has to be removed as well.
Virus vectored immune-contraception is one of the newest method that is to infect introduced animals with genetically engineered viruses. This method is considered environmentally clean, low cost, selective, and ethical. However, it is not fully operational and the effect comes slowly.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Restoration of former habitat===
In many cases the removal of introduced species is sufficient to allow a return to a pre-disturbance state, but generally active management, often in the form of replanting native flora and reintroduction of extirpated fauna is needed to achieve restoration goals. Planting of native species helps to replenish species that were either grazed or out competed. Species of animal can be translocated either from existing populations, or from captive bred populations. These reintroductions need to be carefully managed, particularly in the case of [[endangered species]], where the potential benefits need to be weighed against the possibility of failure. Not all translocations succeed, and it may be necessary to help the reintroduced animals along with supplementary feeding or other kinds of management.

One other important aspect of restoration is prevention, that is, keeping invasive species from returning to a cleared island. This can be achieved by restricting access to the island in question (reducing possible instances of invasion) to more stringent quarantine methods. For example, in order to prevent invasive weeds from returning to Laysan, people working on the island must bring entirely new clothes to the island, which must be frozen prior to arrival.

==Opposition to island restoration==
Prior to the initial efforts to remove rats from New Zealand's offshore islands there was a great deal of skepticism as to the feasibility of island restoration amongst ecologists and conservation workers. However, as the techniques have improved and larger islands have been restored, most of the initial criticisms from within the field have been dropped, in particular as the costs of eradication are often much lower than continuous pest control. Outside of the field of conservation there has been some opposition from other interested groups, particularly from the [[animal rights]] movement, which contends that the [[animal welfare|welfare]] of the pests in question is not adequately addressed in island restoration plans. Because a broad spectrum of pest removal techniques needs to be used, including leg traps, animal rights campaigners accuse ecologists of cruelty, and indifference to non-targeted species that also take bait or are trapped, and suggest that more humane methods such as capture and [[Animal sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] be used instead (something those working in island restoration contend would be too expensive, and potentially ineffective as in [[Kangaroo Island#Conservation|Kangaroo Island]] [[koala]]s.). Some also defend the rights of the introduced species to exist as well.  Others, including scientists affiliated with the animal rights movement, accept that when the choice is between the future of a species and a population of pests, the future of a species must take priority (with the caveat that the extermination is conducted as humanely as possible). Opposition to island restoration has not led to the abandonment of many projects but has delayed several, particularly through court action. Groups sometimes adopt different approaches; opponents of [[hedgehog]] removal in the [[Outer Hebrides]] offered bounties for live hedgehogs removed from the islands and relocated in their natural habitat. Invasive plants can also generate strong feelings. The removal of ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' trees from [[Angel Island (California)|Angel Island]] in [[San Francisco Bay]] faced considerable opposition.

==Island restoration projects==
Island restoration has been attempted in many countries since the 1960s, and has met with varying degrees of success. The following examples highlight some of the factors that influence projects. A comprehensive list of projects can be found on the Database of Island Invasive Species Eradications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DIISE|url=http://diise.islandconservation.org/|publisher=Island Conservation|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Round Island ===
[[Île Ronde, Mauritius|Round Island]] (Île Ronde in French) is a tropical island 22.5 kilometres north of [[Mauritius]], with an area of 1.69 square kilometres and a maximum elevation of 280 metres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mauritian-wildlife.org/application/index.php?tpid=30&amp;tcid=82|title=Welcome to the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation (MWF) - In The Field - Mauritius - Round Island|last=Foundation|first=Mauritian Wildlife|website=www.mauritian-wildlife.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to other [[Mascarene Islands|Mascarene]] islands and islets, Round Island remained relatively pristine until goats and rabbits were introduced in the 19th century (goats were introduced between 1846 and 1868, whilst rabbits were present in large numbers before 1810).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/216936090|title=Lost land of the dodo : an ecological history of Mauritius, Réunion &amp; Rodrigues|last=S.)|first=Cheke, A. S. (Anthony|date=2008|publisher=Yale University Press|others=Hume, Julian P. (Julian Pender)|isbn=9780300141863|location=New Haven|oclc=216936090}}&lt;/ref&gt; These herbivores, along with other factors, such as sporadic logging and frequent cyclones, led to the eventual dwindling of the island's forests and dependent fauna. In turn, this led to soil erosion by wind and rain, impeding forest regeneration, acting as a [[Positive feedback|positive feedback mechanism]] that caused rapid deforestation of the island. In 1957, however, Round Island was officially made a nature reserve, and in 1979 and 1986 was rid of goats (shooting) and rabbits (poisoning), respectively, after several unsuccessful attempts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Since removal of the introduced herbivores, the Round Island plant community has recovered dramatically. This is especially stark for three of the endemic tree species, ''Latania loddigesii'', ''Pandanus vandermeerschii'' and ''Hyophorbe lagenicaulis'', which constituted a large portion of the Round Island forest historically. This has led to six reptile species (five of which were [[critically endangered]]) recovering in tandem with the plant community; these are the skinks ''Leiolopisma telfaririi'' and ''Scelotes bojerii'', the geckos ''Phelsuma guentheri'', ''P. ornata'' and ''Nactus serpensinsula'', and the snake C''asarea dussumerii.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1994-01-01|title=Changes in the vegetation and reptile populations on Round Island, Mauritius, following eradication of rabbits|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006320794900043|journal=Biological Conservation|language=en|volume=67|issue=1|pages=21–28|doi=10.1016/0006-3207(94)90004-3|issn=0006-3207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Round Island restoration program represents one of the longest-running projects of its kind in the world, since its conservation status was confirmed in 1957. Much of the current conservation work on Round Island is conducted by the [[Mauritian Wildlife Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mauritian-wildlife.org/application/index.php?tpid=1&amp;tcid=1|title=Welcome to the Mauritian Wildlife Foundation (MWF) - Home|last=Foundation|first=Mauritian Wildlife|website=www.mauritian-wildlife.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.durrell.org/wildlife/|title=Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust {{!}} Home|website=Durrell|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and revolves around maintaining soil levels, reforestation of the island, and eradication of remaining invasive plants and invertebrates. 

===Aleutian Islands===
[[Image:Fox with auklet.jpg|200px|thumb|Arctic fox with [[least auklet]].]]
The [[Aleutian Islands]], prior to the 18th century, lacked any terrestrial predators, but from the mid-18th century [[Arctic fox]]es were introduced to act as a source for the [[fur trade]], a practice that continued into the early 20th century. This introduction decimated the birds of the chain, particularly [[seabird]]s like the [[whiskered auklet]]. The reduction in seabirds, in turn, had effects on the [[ecology]] of the islands, as many of the plants were dependent on the guano from nesting birds acting as a fertilizer. In the early 1950s managers of the Aleutian Islands Reservation became aware of the damage, and an eradication program began. Since then over 80 islands have been cleared of non-native foxes (only six islands remain) and bird populations have rebounded. Whiskered auklets, which numbered 25,000 in 1974, had increased to 116,000 in 2003.

===Campbell Island===
[[Campbell Island, New Zealand|Campbell Island]] is a sub [[Antarctic]] island 700&amp;nbsp;km south of New Zealand that became infested with [[Norway rat|rats]] in the 19th century. Several endemic birds, including the [[Campbell teal]] and [[Campbell snipe]], only survived on small rocky islets just off the island, and the populations were perilously low. Several teals were taken into captivity for [[ex-situ conservation]], but once they had bred in captivity there was no-where else to return them to until the island was cleared of rats. The DOC's plan to remove rats from the island was one of the most ambitious attempted, as the island was so remote, the rat populations had the highest density of rats anywhere in the world, the weather treacherous and, at 113&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it was the largest island at that point where eradication had been attempted. The poison had to be dropped in the winter, to minimize disturbance to nesting seabirds and reduce the chance of [[bird strike]] for the pilots. After several experiments, the eradication began in 2001. In 2003 trackers with dogs were unable to find any rats. Soon after the island was cleared it was possible to return the teals to the island. [[Snipe]] have self-reintroduced to the island and have begun breeding.

=== South Georgia ===
Rats, brought to [[South Georgia Island]] as stowaways on sealing and whaling ships in the late 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sgisland.gs/index.php/%28e%29Eradication_Of_Rodents?useskin=env|title=Eradication of Rodents|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands|access-date=2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150803043220/http://www.sgisland.gs/index.php/(e)Eradication_Of_Rodents?useskin=env|archivedate=2015-08-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have caused much damage to native wildlife, destroying tens of millions of ground-nesting birds’ eggs and chicks.

'''''Law in Modern Society: Toward a Criticism of Social Theory''''' is a 1976 book by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. In the book, Unger uses the rise and decline of the [[rule of law]] as a vehicle to explore certain problems in [[social theory]]. According to Unger, problems that were central concerns of classical social theorists like [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]]—the problems of explanation, order, and modernity—remain unsolved. Unger contends that the failure of classical social theory to solve these dilemmas can be traced to the way in which it asserted its independence from the ancient political philosophers, namely in its denial of a supra-historical human nature and in its insistence upon the contrast of [[fact-value distinction|fact and value]]. Unger argues that a radical reorientation of social theory is needed to solve the problems it faces. "To carry out its own program," Unger writes, social theory must destroy itself."{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=8}} The rise and decline of the rule of law, and the dilemmas of social theory, converge in the need to be able to compare and criticize different forms of society, in order to be able to more effectively submit the organization of society to the human will.

==Overview==

===Chapter 1: The Predicament of Social Theory===

Unger opens ''Law in Modern Society'' by connecting the study of law to the unsolved problems of social theory. Social theory is the tradition originating in the writings of [[Montesquieu]] and culminating with the work of [[Karl Marx|Marx]], [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]], and [[Max Weber|Weber]].{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=1-3}} In Unger's view, classic social theory as represented by these thinkers is marked by an insistence on the distinction between fact and value, description and evaluation, and also by a denial of a unitary human nature. Unger contrasts classic social theory with the political philosophy of the ancients, who did not recognize as sharp a distinction between fact and value, and maintained that there is a universal human nature that exists in all times and places.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=3-5}}

The study of law affords a vantage point from which to explore three unsolved problems of social theory, according to Unger. The first, the '''problem of method''', is that the prevailing methodological approaches to social study are inadequate. The rationalist approach (as seen in the works of economists) and the historicist approach (which accepts the function of cause and effect but not logical entailment) both invite deterministic social explanations. Unger contends that we need a third method, one that is generalizing, and yet also open to rich historical particularity while not falling into deterministic explanations.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=8-23}}

The second problem is the '''problem of social order'''. How do we account for the existence of a social order? Classical social theory is represented by a struggle between the doctrines of instrumentalism (or private interest) versus legitimacy (or consensus). The legitimacy approach sees rules as manifestations of the shared values of a group. The instrumentalist approach sees society as made up of many divergent individual wills, and rules serve the instrumental purpose of helping the members of society achieve their privately chosen aims in the long run.  Utilitarianism is an example of an instrumentalist approach. According to Unger, we need to go beyond the partial truths expressed in each doctrine.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=23-37}}

The third unsolved problem of social theory is '''the problem of modernity'''. What marks the experience of modernity? What is its place in world history? What is the relationship between ideology and actuality in modern life? Our social theory must be able to reconcile the subjective experience of society with its objective meaning. As history transpires, new puzzles are added to the experience of studying modernity.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=37-40}} A large part of the problem of modernity is the difficulty of comparing modern forms of social life: modern Western society with its forbears, and different forms of contemporary society (traditional, revolutionary socialist, postliberal) among themselves.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=41-42}}

The program of classic social theory has value, according to Unger—namely in allowing us to study human beings as they are rather than as they ought to be, and in helping us to inquire into how each society shapes conduct and consciousness of its members. These classical social theorists sought to create a body of objective knowledge of society that would not be at the mercy of metaphysical speculation or political controversy, and up to a point, they succeeded.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=266-267}} But Unger concludes that the problems of social theory cannot be resolved unless the truths of classic social theory are reconciled with the insights of older political philosophy.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=43}} We need a general doctrine of human nature.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=40-43}}

===Chapter 2: Law and the Forms of Society===

In this chapter Unger addresses the varieties of law and explores the conditions under which each of them develops. '''Customary/interactional''' law is neither public nor positive, and consists of implicit standards of conduct, not formulated rules. Under a system of customary and interactional law, customs are characteristically inarticulate.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=49-50}} '''Bureaucratic/regulatory''' law is public and positive, and emerges with the division of state and society.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=50-52}} A '''legal order''' is a legal system that is committed to being general and autonomous, in addition to being public and positive.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=52-54}}

From this discussion, he draws conclusions about the issue of social order as it relates to the development of law. Unger explains how disintegration of community is accompanied by a trend toward increasing specialization in a society's division of labor, a trend that is responsible for the separation of state and society.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=63}} This process erodes the basis for an inclusive set of shared beliefs.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=61-62}} The legal order emerges with interest group pluralism,{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=66-76}} as well as reliance on higher divine or universal law as standard for justifying and criticizing a state's positive law.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=76-86}}  The rule of law is a response to the decline of order in society.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=127-133}} But when the belief in higher law declines, the legal order is threatened. In contemporary history, the natural rights synthesis that underlies the legal order ideal has been undone, with the result that the coherence of the rule of law ideal is compromised.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=84-86}}

===Chapter 3: Law and Modernity===

In this chapter, Unger traces the rise and decline of the rule of law in society. He begins by setting out a preliminary framework for the comparison of societies, and uses this framework to examine tribal society, liberal society, and aristocratic society. Unger's inquiry into these types of society revolves around three questions: What is the nature of the contrast between insiders and outsiders? How are insiders drawn together in significant groups and what is the quality of their encounters with strangers? And, finally, how individuals conceive of the place of the ideal—do they have a concept of the right or the good that transcends the natural or social world?{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=137-140}}

Unger concludes that tribal society displays the starkest possible contrast between insiders and outsiders; outsiders are not regarded as human beings with whom the insiders share anything significant in common. There is a paucity of significant groups in tribal society. And there is little conception of a good or right that towers over the immanent reality of daily life or the natural world. The important insight, for Unger, is that tribal society is an extremely cohesive social world, where there is deep agreement about fundamental social questions, profound distrust of strangers, and no recognition of overarching ideals against which the quotidian life or nature can be compared.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=140-143}}

At the other extreme, liberal society is one in which the contrast between insiders and outsiders is softened by the fact that each individual belongs to a large number of significant groups. Because members of liberal society become accustomed to other people being both insiders and outsiders in different contexts, the hostility of tribal society for the stranger is replaced, in liberal society, by ideals of impersonal respect and formal equality. People will abide by relatively stable standards of social order because it is to their advantage to do so, not because they observe identical conceptions of the true and the good. In liberal society, a concept of the right and the good transcends the reality of daily life and the natural world.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=143-147}}

Unger views aristocratic society as a synthesis of tribal and liberal societies. Aristocratic society unites universalism and particularism. In aristocratic society, significant social groups are experienced as steps on a hierarchic ladder. Each individual belongs to a specific group, his estate, which confers on him a range of entitlements and obligations and predetermine his outlook on the world. These strata are sharply divided from each other and are decisive in determining the quality of the individual's life. Aristocratic society's view of the relationship between the ideal and the actual occupies an intermediate position between the views of tribal and liberal society. In aristocratic society, there is an intense oscillation between a tendency to sanctify existing social arrangements and the tendency to oppose them to a higher heavenly perfection.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=147-153}}

Having set out a rudimentary grammar for the comparison of societies, Unger traces the emergence and decline of the liberal state and the rule of law{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=134}} (which Unger describes as the soul of liberal society{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=192}}).

Liberal society developed out of aristocratic society, namely the society of estates (Standestaat), which was an intermediary system between feudal society and the modern liberal state.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=155-156}} The law of the Standestaat was a forerunner to the modern legal system, and consisted of an area of royal discretion (matters falling under the prince's prerogative to keep the peace) and a higher law (matters pertaining to the privileges and obligations of estates of the realm).{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=158-160}} The elements that make up a modern legal order—positiveness, publicity, generality and autonomy—were not present,{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=160}} but as the formerly neat line between royal prerogatives and the law of estates faded away, the prince was increasingly held to standards of generality and autonomy, and estate privileges acquired a public and positive character.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=162-163}} The confinement of royal power by the fundamental law of the Standestaat was supported by a belief in a God-given natural order.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=166}}

The liberal state—with its multiplicity of significant groups, the disappearance of a sharp distinction between insiders and outsiders, and a stark division between the ideal and the actual—faced two questions with increasing urgency: how can there be consensus without widespread agreement about the good,{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=169-170}} and how can we distinguish legitimate from illegitimate uses of power in the face of dissolving hierarchy and moral confusion?{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=172-173}} The rule of law, which attempted to guarantee the impersonality of power, was a way of dealing with these urgent questions.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=176-178}}

The rule of law has two major premises—that the most significant forms of power can be concentrated in government, and that power can be effectively constrained by rules. But Unger contends that these premises are largely fictitious.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=178-179}} They are undermined by the awareness that individuals are most vulnerable to hierarchies of the family, the workplace, and the market that are largely beyond the reach of the legal system, and also that rules can never make power truly impersonal and impartial—administrators and judges will always decide among competing sets of beliefs in rendering a decision.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=179-181}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, the very assumptions of the rule of law ideal appear to be falsified by the reality of life in liberal society ... The state, a supposedly neutral overseer of social conflict, is forever caught up in the antagonism of private interests and made the tool of one faction or another. Thus, in seeking to discipline and to justify the exercise of power, men are condemned to pursue an objective they are forbidden to reach. And this repeated disappointment accentuates still further the gap between the vision of the ideal and the experience of actuality.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=181}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The contradictions and paradoxes of liberal society, by undermining the rule of law and the ideals it represents, ultimately give rise to what Unger calls postliberal society. Postliberal society is marked by overt intervention by the government in areas previously regarded as beyond the reach of state action, and a gradual approximation of state and society. The state's pretense of being a neutral guardian of the social order is abandoned.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=192-193}} These trends are reflected in the rise of open-ended clauses in legislation, administration, and adjudication, and a concern with substantive justice over formal justice.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=192-200}} The effacement of the boundary between state and society, called corporatism, leads to the rise of state institutions that rival the state in their power.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=200-203}} Unger argues that these welfare state institutions are an assault on the legal order, while the corporatist tendencies in postliberal society undermine bureaucratic law.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=200}} The danger of these tendencies, Unger contends, is demonstrated by the Weimar Republic, in which the decline of the rule of law in favor of a welfare corporate state set the stage for terror and inhumanity of Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=216-220}}

Unger concludes his examination of law and modernity by looking at two varieties of the modern state—the traditionalist state{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=224-231}} and the revolutionary socialist{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=231-234}}—then considering two possibilities for the development of law in the future. Seeing similar tensions within traditionalist and revolutionary socialist societies,{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=234-235}} Unger points out that the liberal state is only a special case of modernity.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=166}} He concludes that there's no more reason to think that societies will converge toward similarity rather than grow in their differences.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=237}}

The future of the rule of law, Unger suggests, could take two forms. The first, pessimistic, possibility he imagines is a scenario in which the progression of custom, bureaucracy, and rule of law revolves in a circle, and the postliberal decline of the rule of law would lead to the return of custom as the exclusive instrument of the social order.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=238-239}} There would be a relapse of a tribalism that sanctifies the existing order of the group as an irrevocable decree of nature. The second possibility Unger imagines is an optimistic scenario, which Unger describes as a spiral in which "individual freedom could be rescued from the demise of the rule of law."{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=239}} On this model, society defeats inequality to such an extent that people place greater confidence in collective choices, not suspecting them as a product of the interests of dominant groups.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=239-240}} The increasing equality of society would make possible a greater consensus about the immanent order of society and help refine further the meaning of equality.{{sfn|Unger|1976|p=240}}

===Chapter 4: The Predicament of Social Theory Revisited===

In this final chapter, Unger returns to the questions of the methodology of social theory with which he opened the book.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=243-245}} For each of the unsolved problems of social theory—the problem of method, the problem of social order, and the problem of modernity—Unger concludes that the theoretical problems of social theory require a political solution.

For the problem of method, Unger offers the interpretive method as an alternative to the rationalist and historicist approaches favored by classical social theorists. The interpretive method, which emphasizes the embeddedness of action in belief and the way social phenomena cluster into meaningful totalities, avoids the tendency of rationalist and historicist methods to fall into deterministic accounts of human activity, while also offering the prospect of reconciling the demands of subjectivity and objectivity in social explanation. But the possibility of reconciling subjectivity and objectivity in social theory ultimately is premised on a belief in the unity of the human spirit, and in order to be achieved, we would need a community of experience, understanding and value to come into existence. For this reason, to solve the problem of method completely requires a political solution.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=245-262}}

For the second persistent problem of social theory, the problem of social order, Unger sees the crux of this problem in the divergence between the doctrines of legitimacy/consensus and instrumentalism/private interest. These views offer completely different accounts of the basis for order in society. Unger allows that instrumentalism is more effective in explaining liberal society, while consensus theory comes closer in explaining tribal and hierarchical societies.
Social study of law suggests a response to our puzzlement over the basis of order in society. It puts the controversy between the doctrines of private interest and consensus, and hence between the instrumental and noninstrumental view of rules, in perspective. But once again, a political solution is called for to deal with the divergence between instrumentalism and consensus theories: the crisis of order will only be fully resolved once it reconciles individual freedom with community cohesion, and the sense of immanent order with possibility of community cohesion.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=262-265}}

Addressing the final unsolved problem of social theory, the problem of modernity, Unger concludes that we must reject the approaches offered by both liberalism, which views society as an association of individuals with conflicting ends and whose security and freedom are guaranteed by the rule of law, and Marxism, which sees society as a structure of class domination whose true character is hidden by the prevailing ideology. Unger argues we must focus on the interplay between belief and experience, consciousness and organization, in the study of modernity. This interplay takes new forms as history unfolds. The political problem presented by modernity—a problem confronted by postliberal, traditionalist, and revolutionary socialist societies—is the problem of reconciling freedom and community. Harmonizing the sense of latent order in society with the capacity to let will remake social arrangements is the key to reconciling freedom and community.{{sfn|Unger|1976|pp=265-266}}

==Reception==

[[Talcott Parsons]] reviewed ''Law in Modern Society'' for the ''[[Law &amp; Society Review]]'', and offered qualified praise for Unger's work. "The book is important because it contains one of the sharpest and clearest statements of the problem of what the author calls the place of a legal system in a total and complex society."{{sfn|Parsons|1977|p=145}} However, Parsons contends that Unger erroneously claims that law as a social phenomenon is restricted to its interpenetration with the state. Parsons also "disagree[s] with [Unger's] characterization of the legal system as ''part of the structure of modern societies''."{{sfn|Parsons|1977|p=149}} Parsons concludes: "His is both an important and a good book, but it does not give the reader a
competent and comprehensive appraisal of the issues which contemporary legal and 'social' theory need to confront in their mutual pursuit of an understanding of legal systems."{{sfn|Parsons|1977|p=149}}

Manning J. Dauer reviewed ''Law in Modern Society'' in ''[[The Journal of Politics]]'', describing the book as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;an able work arguing for a new synthesis in social sciences and in legal theory. The argument that traditionalistic aspects now need modifying is well presented. The rule of law is an important concept, but it has to be adapted to more individualistic judgments as the social sciences impinge on traditionalistic interpretations. Might he consider John Rawls's attempt to define Social Justice? Unger points out the need and the difficulties; the method whereby this will be achieved is still in process, but the dilemma presented to the social sciences is well stated.{{sfn|Dauer|1977|p=1106}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

German sociologist Klaus Eder considered ''Law in Modern Society'' alongside [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Donald Black]]'s ''The Behavior of Law''. Eder considered Unger's argument in detail, and concluded that Unger offered a promising research program for a sociological study of law:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This model of the evolution of law is an interesting working hypothesis, which may be especially fruitful for the analysis of changes in modern law. [Unger's] book is ... neither more nor less than a research program, probably a fruitful one, for the sociological study of law on two levels: a synchronic structural description of forms of normative order and a diachronic social-historical analysis of the factors that produce structural transformations of law.{{sfn|Eder|1977|p=142-143}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[James B. Stewart|James Stewart]] reviewed ''Law in Modern Society'' for the ''[[Journal of Economic Issues]]'', writing that "this book should be read by those seeking to escape the limitations of existing social theory and particularly neoclassical economics. In particular, Unger's emphasis on the need to undertake cross-cultural analyses and his careful delineation of alternative concepts of law provide a useful guide for further developments in institutional economics."{{sfn|Stewart|1976|pp=990-991}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Neil T. Duxbury wrote a retrospective assessment of ''Law in Modern Society'' in ''[[The Modern Law Review]]''. Duxbury acknowledges Unger's commitment to "straddle the frontiers of social theory" in both ''[[Knowledge and Politics]]'' and ''Law in Modern Society'', calling this persistence in addressing the most difficult questions of social theory a "defining feature of the book." However, Duxbury finds fault with the book, contending that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unger's notion of post-liberalism is awash with over-generalised arguments. Contrary to his own suggestions, there appears to be no reason why the corporatist tendency within post-liberalism should result not only in a move towards the establishment of substantive justice, but also in the maintenance of the liberal tendency towards formal justice.{{sfn|Duxbury|1986|p=673}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Duxbury concludes that Unger's work operates at such a vague and abstract level of generality, that his work might be invalidated by empirical evidence left unexplored by Unger:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Unger has continued to develop his 'modernist' position with a conceptual vagueness which suggests not so much that he should be criticised for theorising at a selected level of abstraction, but rather that, so long as he continues to operate at this level, he will always, if only potentially, be open to the charge of failing to pay sufficient attention to the empirical evidence on offer-evidence which may sometimes invalidate the conceptualisations to which he ascribes.{{sfn|Duxbury|1986|p=679}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Alfred P. Rubin offered high praise for ''Law in Modern Society'' in ''Perspective'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is impossible to do justice to this book in a short review. The evolution of society from status to contract and back to status has been noted by many other writers, but Professor Unger's framework for social analysis is in large part original, accessible only to sophisticated scholars, and possibly seminal.{{sfn|Rubin|1976|p=114}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Malacology'''&lt;ref&gt;From French ''malacologie'', contraction of malacozoologie, from [[New Latin]] Malacozoa "zoological group including soft-bodied animals" from Greek [[wikt:μαλακός|μαλακός]] - ''malakos'' "soft" + [[wikt:ζῷον|ζῷον]] "animal.&lt;/ref&gt; is the branch of [[invertebrate]] [[zoology]] that deals with the study of the [[Mollusca]] (mollusks or molluscs), the second-largest [[phylum]] of animals in terms of described [[species]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/malacology/|title=Home - Division of Invertebrate Zoology|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208135845/http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/malacology/|archivedate=2007-02-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the [[arthropod]]s. Mollusks include [[snail]]s and [[slug]]s, [[clam]]s, [[octopus]] and [[squid]], and numerous other kinds, many of which have [[mollusc shell|shells]]. One division of malacology, [[conchology]], is devoted to the study of mollusk shells. Malacology derives from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μαλακός}}, ''malakos'', "soft"; and {{lang|grc|-λογία}}, ''[[-logy|-logia]]''.

Fields within malacological research include [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], [[ecology]] and [[evolution]]. Applied malacology studies medical, veterinary, and agricultural applications, for example mollusks as vectors of disease, as in [[schistosomiasis]].

[[Archaeology]] employs malacology to understand the evolution of the [[climate]], the biota of the area, and the usage of the site.

In 1681, [[Filippo Bonanni]] wrote the first book ever published that was solely about seashells, the shells of marine mollusks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansp.org/museum/digital_collections/shells/bounanni.php |title=Buonanni's Chiocciole (1681) |work=ansp.org |accessdate=8 August 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322225631/http://www.ansp.org/museum/digital_collections/shells/bounanni.php |archivedate=22 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was entitled: ''Ricreatione dell' occhio e dela mente nell oservation' delle Chiociolle, proposta a' curiosi delle opere della natura, &amp;c.''&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [[Filippo Bonanni|Bonanni F.]] 1681.

Zoological methods are used in malacological research. Malacological field methods and laboratory methods (such as collecting, documenting and archiving, and molecular techniques) were summarized by Sturm et al. (2006).&lt;ref name="Dillon R.

== Malacologists ==
{{main|List of malacologists}}
Those who study malacology are known as malacologists. Those who study primarily or exclusively the  [[mollusc shell|shells]] of mollusks are known as [[conchologist]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1052">'''Marking time''' is a [[military step]] in which soldiers march in place, moving their legs as in [[marching]], but without stepping forward.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mil/usapa/index.html US Army Field Manual] FM 22-5  DRILL AND CEREMONIES&lt;/ref&gt;

The military [[drill command]] is "Mark Time!”  to change from standing at attention to 'Marking Time' or to change from marching at 'Quick Time' to 'Marking Time'.  The resulting action is to march in the same place, not to move in any direction. Also used during Color Guard maneuvers to make minor adjustments in a single file presentation of the colors. 

The term can also be used to refer to doing a minor job or task while waiting for an opportunity to arise, thus the casual usage in slang as describing motion without progress - not getting anywhere.  As with other [[military jargon]] it entered civilian use when a large portion of the population had military experience and understood the context.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1212">The '''National Resources Inventory''' (NRI) is a periodic assessment of the status and changing conditions of the soil, water, and related resources on private land conducted by [[USDA]]’s [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] (NRCS). The survey has been conducted at 5-year intervals since 1977, most recently in 2007, though a 2010 mid-cycle data release occurred in December 2013. NRCS released initial results from the 1997 survey in late 1999. The 2010 report includes comparison of the data relative to 1982.

Summary pages exist for [[soil erosion]], land use status and trends, development of non-federal rural land, and rangeland.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20086">'''New Philology''' generally refers to a branch of Mexican [[ethnohistory]] and [[philology]] that uses colonial-era native language texts written by Indians to construct history from the indigenous point of view. The name New Philology was coined by [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] to describe work that he and his doctoral students and scholarly collaborators in history, anthropology, and linguistics had pursued since the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;James Lockhart, "[[Charles Gibson]] and the Ethnohistory of Postconquesst Central Mexico" in ''Nahuas and Spaniards: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology.'' Stanford University Press and UCLA Latin American Studies, vol. 76. 1991, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; Lockhart published a great many essays elaborating on the concept and content of the New Philology and [[Matthew Restall]] published a description of it in the ''Latin American Research Review.''&lt;ref&gt;Restall, Matthew, "A History of the New Philology and the New Philology in History", ''Latin American Research Review'' - Volume 38, Number 1, 2003, pp.113–134&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques of the New Philology have also been applied in other disciplines such as European [[medieval]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;M. J. Driscoll, "[http://www.driscoll.dk/docs/words.html The words on the page: Thoughts on philology, old and new]", in: ''Creating the medieval saga: Versions, variability, and editorial interpretations of Old Norse saga literature,'' edited by Judy Quinn &amp; Emily Lethbridge. Syddansk Universitetsforlag, Odense 2010, pp. 85–102.&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
==Historical Development==
Lockhart's discusses philology and in particular the new philology in an essay for a collection of essays hosted digitally at University of Oregon.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction: Background and Course of the New Philology" ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest [[Mesoamerican]] Ethnohistory'', Provisional Version hosted by the Wired Humanities Project at the University of Oregon (2007). [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the new philology was built upon the foundation of the old, which focuses on close reading of texts and resulted in collections of printed documentation. An important nineteenth-century Mexican philologist was [[Joaquín García Icazbalceta]].  In Mexico and Latin America, nineteenth-century scholars mined the Spanish archives for colonial documentation for their national histories. A feature of the New Philology is that the publication of indigenous texts in the original language with translations with introductions was standard.  The translated texts often appeared first, followed by a separate scholarly monograph analyzing the texts. The two should be considered two parts of the same scholarly publication. Many of the scholars working in the New Philology did so before it gained that designation.  A particularly valuable online publication are essays where individual scholars discuss the process and product of translating and publishing particular native language documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Provisional Version hosted by the Wired Humanities Project at the University of Oregon (2007). [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Philology was developed from the 1970s and onwards, building on the work of a previous generation of scholars, most especially historian [[Charles Gibson]], whose ''Aztecs under Spanish Rule'' (1964)&lt;ref&gt;''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule&gt;'' Charles Gibson, 1964 Stanford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and his earlier ''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century'' (1952)&lt;ref&gt;''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century'' Charles Gibson, 1952. Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt; were major scholarly achievements, placing colonial-era Aztecs (now more commonly called [[Nahuas]]) at the center of historical analysis. The leading figure in the establishment of the New Philological historiographical approach was [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] who, in the early 1970s, began learning Nahuatl and studying local level indigenous sources in the [[Nahuatl language]]. His magnum opus was published in 1992, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest.'',&lt;ref&gt;''Nahuas After the Conquest: Social and Cultural History of the Indians of Central Mexico, sixteenth through eighteenth centuries,'' James Lockhart, 1992. Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which incorporated and extended his own work and that of others.

An early and important text in this vein was ''Nahuatl in the Middle Years'' (1976), published by Lockhart and University of Texas linguist [[Frances Karttunen]].&lt;ref&gt;''Nahuatl in the Middle Years: Language contact Phenomena in Texts of the Colonial Period'', Frances Karttunen &amp; James Lockhart, 1976, University of California Press, Berkeley, California.&lt;/ref&gt; Also important for the early history of the New Philology was the publication of ''Beyond the Codices'' (1976), alluding to the existence of native language texts other than the formal ones termed codices.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond the Codices'' [[Arthur J. O. Anderson]], Frances Berdan, and James Lockhart, 1976. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arthur J. O. Anderson]], a leading figure in Mesoamerican ethnohistory for his collaboration with [[Charles Dibble]] in publishing an English translation of the [[Florentine Codex]] by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], participated in this early project of publishing local-level colonial documents.

In the mid-1970s Lockhart began mentoring history doctoral students at UCLA, who learned Nahuatl and began research on particular region documentation in Nahuatl. Sarah Cline was the first to complete a dissertation in 1981, based on these types of local-level sources, a set of 60 testaments from the central Mexican Indian polity or ''altepetl'' of [[Culhuacán (altepetl)|Culhuacán]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Testaments of Culhuacan''. S.L. Cline and Miguel Leon-Portilla (Eds.) 1984. UCLA Latin American Center Nahuatl Studies Series, vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Colonial Culhuacan, 1580-1600: A Social History of an Aztec Town'', S.L. Cline, 1986. New Mexico: University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Testaments of Culhuacan, Sarah Cline. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1993 Cline also published a set of early local-level Nahuatl censuses from the Cuernavaca, as ''The Book of Tributes'', as well as an analysis of all three volumes, adding to the existing published corpus.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Tributes: Early Sixteenth-Century Nahuatl Censuses from Morelos''. S. L. Cline, 1993, Museo de Antropología e Historia, Archivo Histórico Collección Antigua, vol. 549. UCLA Latin American Center Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Book of Tributes", Sarah Cline, ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Azteckischer Zensus, Zur indianischen Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft im Marquesado um 1540: Aus dem "Libro de Tributos" (Col. Ant. Ms. 551) im Archivo Historico,'' Mexico. 2 vols. Eike Hinz, Claudine Hartau, and Marie Luise Heimann-Koenen, eds. 1983. Hanover.&lt;/ref&gt; In this first generation Robert Haskett, who examined Nahuatl texts on colonial Cuernavaca, later also publishing on primordial titles.&lt;ref&gt;''Indigenous Rulers: An Ethnohistory of Indian Town Government in Colonial Cuernavaca'', Robert Haskett, 1991, University of New Mexico Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Primordial Titles", Robert Haskett. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Schroeder delved into the rich texts produced by seventeenth-century Nahua historian, Chimalpahin, resulting in several publications &lt;ref&gt;''Chimalpahin and the Kingdoms of Chalco'', 1991, Susan Schroeder, Tucson: University of Arizona Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Codex Chimalpahin: Society and Politics in Mexico-Tenochtitlan, Tlatelolco, Texcoco, Culhuacan, and other Nahua Altetpetl in Central Mexico.'' Domingo de San Anton Munon Chimalpahin Cuauhtlehuantzin, Arthur J.O. Anderson, Susan Schroeder, Wayne Ruwet. 1997. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Annals of His Time: Don Domingo de San Anton Munon Chimalpahin Quahtlehuantzin''James Lockhart, Susan Schroeder, and Doris Namala.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Annals of Chimalpahin", Susan Schroeder. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory''[http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The largest number of local-level indigenous documents, such as testaments and bills of sale, are in Nahuatl, resulting in Nahuatl having the largest set of published sets of documents and monographic scholarly analyses. Rebecca Horn's dissertation on Coyoacan and later Stanford University Press monograph showed the multiple connections between Nahuas and Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;''Postconquest Coyoacan: Nahua-Spanish Relations in the Valley of Mexico.'' Rebecca Horn, 1997. Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Nahuatl and Spanish Sources for Coyoacan", Rebecca Horn. ''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory'' [http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Horn also served as associate editor of the UCLA Latin American Center's Nahuatl Studies Series.

Some UCLA later doctoral students of Lockhart, particularly [[Matthew Restall]] and Kevin Terraciano, first learned Nahuatl and then other Mesoamerican indigenous languages (Mixtec and Yucatec Maya) that had a significant corpus of documents in the language. Restall's UCLA 1995 dissertation "The World of the Cah: postconquest Yucatec Maya Society" was followed by his 1995 publication of a collection of eighteenth-century wills.&lt;ref&gt;''Life and Death in a Maya Community: The Ixil Testaments of the 1760s.'' Matthew Restall, 1995. Lancaster CA: Labyrinthos&lt;/ref&gt; and culminating in his Stanford University Press monograph, ''The Maya World: Yucatec culture and society, 1550-1850.''&lt;ref&gt;''The Maya World: Yucatec culture and society, 1550-1850''. Matthew Restall. 1997, Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Sources for the Ethnohistory and Afrohistory of Postconquest Yucatan," Matthew Restall.''Sources and Methods for the Study of Postconquest Mesoamerican Ethnohistory''[http://whp.uoregon.edu/Lockhart/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  Terraciano's 1994 dissertation on the Mixtecs of Oaxaca entitled ''Ñudzahui history: Mixtec writing and culture in colonial Oaxaca'' was followed by his 2001 monograph ''The Mixtecs of Colonial Oaxaca: Ñudzahui History''.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Terraciano,''The Mixtecs of Colonial Oaxaca: Nudzahui History, sixteen through eighteenth centuries''. 2001, Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Terraciano and Restall revised the titles of their dissertations in the published monographs to allow better recognition by readers of the publication's subject; Cline used "Aztec" in the title of her monograph on Culhuacan, rather than "Nahua", which in the 1980s had little recognition value even among specialists on Latin American cultures.

Lauren Lambert Jennings explicitly applied techniques from New Philology to the study of European Song texts quoting their "central premise [as] the idea that [[codex]] is not merely a neutral container for its texts." She continued by saying that the New Philologists and scholars of "textual cultures" "posit that a work's meaning (literary and cultural) is determined by the entire manuscript matrix — its physical form, contents, scribe(s), readers, and history."&lt;ref&gt;Lauren Lambert Jennings, "Tracing Voices: Song as Literature in Late Medieval Italy" (Ph.D. dissertation: University of Pennsylvania, 2012), p. 42, online at [https://usc.academia.edu/LaurenJennings/Books/1591293/Tracing_Voices_Song_as_Literature_in_Late_Medieval_Italy]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oceanic and Atmospheric Research''' ('''OAR''') is a division of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).  OAR is also referred to as '''NOAA Research'''.

NOAA Research is the research and development arm of NOAA and is the driving force behind NOAA [[Natural environment|environmental]] products and services aimed at protecting life and property and promoting sustainable economic growth. [[Research]], conducted by programs within NOAA and through collaborations outside NOAA, focuses on enhancing the understanding of environmental phenomena such as [[tornado]]es, [[hurricane]]s, [[climate]] variability, changes in the [[ozone layer]], [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño/La Niña]] events, [[Fishery|fisheries]] productivity, [[ocean current]]s, deep sea [[thermal vent]]s, and [[Coastal ecosystems|coastal ecosystem]] health. 

The origins of NOAA Research date back more than 200 years with the creation of the Survey of the Coast in 1807 by Thomas Jefferson. The Coast Survey, which became the U.S. Lake Survey office in 1841, was developed to undertake "a hydrographic survey of northwestern [Great] lakes." Research executed by the scientists of this group was innovative and holistic: the first current meters were developed to understand water flow rates, and forecasting techniques were greatly enhanced to predict water levels and the relationship to  lakefront property. The same traits of world class, long-term research continue to define NOAA Research today.

The science and technology that NOAA Research produces is not only relevant to society, it anticipates and responds to partners’ needs to demonstrates the value of technologies so that partners can deploy them into their applications. OAR works with end-users to integrate mature technologies (and associated expertise) into larger systems, either in NOAA operations or partner applications, via testbeds, patents, etc.

==Organization==
NOAA Research is an open research network consisting of seven federal research laboratories, six program offices, sixteen Cooperative Institutes (which are non-federal, non-profit research institutions in 5-10 year collaborative partnerships with NOAA), and 33 university based Sea Grant programs. OAR also relies on work performed at numerous public, private, and academic institutions. Through its laboratories, programs, and external partners, OAR seeks to balance the activities that benefit from the long-term, dedicated capabilities of federal facilities with those that require the diverse expertise of our university partners.

The components and programs of NOAA Research are:
* 7 NOAA [[Laboratory|laboratories]]
* [http://ci.noaa.gov/ 16 Cooperative Institutes]
* [http://cpo.noaa.gov/ NOAA Climate Program Office]
* [http://owaq.noaa.gov/ Office of Weather and Air Quality]
* [[Office of Ocean Exploration|NOAA Office of Ocean Exploration and Research]]
* [[National Sea Grant Program|NOAA National Sea Grant Program]]
* [http://uas.noaa.gov/ NOAA Unmanned Aircraft Systems]
* [http://www.oceanacidification.noaa.gov/ NOAA Ocean Acidification Program]

==What NOAA Research does==
Working under the broad themes of Climate, [[Atmosphere]], and Oceans, NOAA scientists study the ocean's depths and the highest reaches of [[Outer space|space]]. NOAA's long-term commitment to conducting preeminent research includes engaging in-house and external talent to: 
* Continue to conduct [[experiment]]s to understand natural processes (physical, geochemical, ecological) 
* Build predictive models for use in [[weather]], climate, [[Sun|solar]], ocean, and coastal assessments and [[prediction]]s.
* Develop and deploy new observing technologies to provide data to support predictive models and to document natural variability.
* Develop new analytical and forecast tools to improve weather services and earlier warnings for [[natural disaster]]s.
* Use new [[information technology]] to share information with other federal and academic scientists.
* Prepare scientific assessments and information products to enhance [[public education]] and guide [[government]]al action. 
Research plans and products are developed in partnership with [[academia]] and other [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agencies]], and are peer-reviewed and widely distributed. A high premium is placed on external collaboration both domestically and internationally.

NOAA Research has three primary research areas: Climate, Weather and Air Chemistry, and Oceans, Coasts &amp; the Great Lakes.

===Climate Research===
NOAA's research laboratories, the Climate Program Office, and research partners conduct research into complex [[climate system]]s and how they work. The aim of this research is to predict climate variation in the shorter term, for example, cold spells or periods of [[drought]], and over longer terms, such as centuries and beyond.

NOAA scientists are at the forefront of studying climate change and modeling what the effects will be on the Earth. Researchers at NOAA’s Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) have developed the Coupled Hydrosphere-Atmosphere Research Model (CHARM) to enable a valid assessment of the impact of how [[climate change]] might affect the climate and [[ecology]] of the [[Great Lakes]]. The CHARM model provides a realistic surface-atmosphere feedback portrayal, and accounts for runoff from land surfaces. It allows researchers to predict that [[global warming]] likely will bring higher [[temperature]]s and increased [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] to the Great Lakes. Development of a second generation of CHARM is underway to help answer questions about [[greenhouse warming]] effects on Great Lakes water quantity.

NOAA researchers closely monitor the Earth's atmosphere searching for clues about long-term changes in the global climate. The data collected worldwide by NOAA researchers contributes to the understanding of complex climatic systems and the ability to forecast changes.

===Weather and Air Chemistry Research===
NOAA Research organizations conduct research on the upper and lower atmosphere as well as the space environment. Their findings form the basis for NOAA's contributions to major national and international environmental programs and agreements.

For instance, improvements in forecast and warning services provided by the National Weather Service are a direct result of NOAA research.  Improvements in numerical modeling, observations gathered by satellites and Doppler weather radars (NEXRAD), and sophisticated weather warning and information processing and communications systems, have collectively led to significantly improved severe weather forecasts and warnings.

Other research programs focus on observation and study of the chemical and physical processes of the atmosphere, detecting the effects of pollution on those processes and monitoring and forecasting the phenomena affecting the Sun-Earth environment.

===Oceans, Coasts &amp; the Great Lakes Research===
NOAA Research, in cooperation with its research partners, explores and investigates ocean habitats and resources. The findings of NOAA researchers contribute to the management of fisheries, conservation of coastlines, and development of a stronger economy through marine products and businesses, such as biotechnology and sustainable aquaculture.

NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) in [[Seattle, Washington]], designed Deep-ocean Assessment and Reporting of Tsunamis (DART-II) technology, which provides two-way communication capabilities, allowing engineers the ability to troubleshoot these systems from the lab and repair them remotely when possible. This capability minimizes system downtime, especially in the harsh winter conditions of the [[Pacific Ocean|North Pacific]], and reduces costs by not having to deploy a ship to make repairs.

==Benefits of NOAA Research==
Most environmental questions are not easily answered. NOAA is committed to tackling the complex issues that only advanced scientific knowledge can adequately address. NOAA Research seeks to:
* Provide comprehensive knowledge to guide national environmental policy decisions, including better predictions of the climate response to emissions changes, choices for protection of the ozone layer, and alternatives for developing coastal communities; 
* Improve environmental services to the nation, including reliable predictions and assessments; and
* Promote economic growth through science for decision-making, new technology, and partnerships with academia and industry.

==NOAA Research laboratories==
The 7 laboratories that are part of NOAA Research are located throughout the United States near their areas of focus.

* [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]] (AOML) - [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida|FL]]
* [[Air Resources Laboratory]] (ARL) - [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], [[Maryland|MD]]
* [[Earth System Research Laboratory]] (ESRL) - Boulder, CO
* [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]] (GFDL) - [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey|NJ]]
* [[Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory]] (GLERL) - [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan|MI]]
* [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] (NSSL) - [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]], [[Oklahoma|OK]]
* [[Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory]] (PMEL) - [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|WA]] and [[Newport, Oregon|Newport]], [[Oregon|OR]]

The NOAA Research Laboratories conduct an integrated program of research, technology development, and services to improve the understanding of Earth's atmosphere, oceans and inland waters, and to describe and predict changes occurring to them. The laboratories and their field stations are located across the country and around the world.

The laboratories have established formal collaborative agreements with universities/non-profit research institutions to form joint research institutes that are centers of scientific excellence pertaining to the earth's oceans, inland waters, intermountain west, atmosphere, and arctic environment.

Scientific reviews are conducted every five years to evaluate the quality, relevance, and performance of research conducted at the OAR laboratories. These reviews help to strategically position laboratories in their planning of future science and are intended to ensure that OAR laboratory research is linked to the NOAA Next Generation Strategic Plan, remains relevant to the NOAA research mission and its priorities, and is consistent with NOAA planning, programming, and budgeting processes.

'''Ohm's acoustic law''', sometimes called the '''acoustic phase law''' or simply '''Ohm's law''', states that a [[music]]al [[sound]] is perceived by the [[ear]] as a set of a number of constituent pure [[harmonic oscillation|harmonic]] tones.&lt;ref&gt;Ohm's law, ''n''.2, ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Text-book of Physics | author = A. Wilmer Duff, editor | year = 1912 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=U_EzAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA530&amp;dq=ohm+tone+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=MguHR5ipHpnOtAPuwYDABw#PPA529,M1 | publisher =  P. Blakiston's Son &amp; Co | location=Philadelphia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was proposed by physicist [[Georg Ohm]] in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Ohm, G., ''Annalen der Physik'' (1843) 59 513&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] elaborated the law into what is often today known as Ohm's acoustic law, by adding that the quality of a tone depends solely on the number and relative strength of its partial simple tones, and not on their relative phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Science of Musical Sounds | author = Dayton Clarence Miller | publisher = The Macmillan Company | year = 1916 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7f8KAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=ohm+tone+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=MguHR5ipHpnOtAPuwYDABw }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Lessons in Elementary Practical Physics, Vol. III, Part 1: Practical Acoustics | author = Charles Lightfoot Barnes | publisher = London: Macmillan and Co.

The law has also been interpreted as "a pitch corresponding to a certain frequency can only be heard if the acoustical wave contains power at that frequency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Acoustics and psychoacoustics | author = David M. Howard, Jamie A. S. Angus | publisher = Focal Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-240-51995-1 | page = 123 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Yyk5nAIJcBcC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=intitle:Acoustics+intitle:and+intitle:Psychoacoustics+ohm+law&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;ei=5bxlSby6B5CQkQSJlpznAQ#PPA123,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These laws are true to the extent that the ear is sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of the acoustic waves, and further, is able to resolve the differences in their frequency. In modern times, the sensitivity of human [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] to the phase of tone components has been extensively investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Loudspeaker and Headphone Handbook | author = John Borwick | publisher = Focal Press | isbn = 0-240-51578-1 | year = 2001 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pAOFt1znYr8C&amp;pg=PA655&amp;dq=ohm%27s-law+acoustic+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=NAiHR_CaNp6ktgP_i4zQBQ&amp;sig=1OIFUWDCMTIUILOZrnaa5j3ef9M#PPA655,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Controversy has led to this characterization:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =  Foundations of Modern Auditory Theory | editor = Jerry V. Tobias | publisher = Academic Press | volume = 1 | author = W. Dixon Ward | chapter = Musical Perception |year = 1970 | page = 438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For years musicians have been told that the ear is able to separate any complex signal into a series of sinusoidal signals – that it acts as a [[Fourier analysis|Fourier analyzer]].  This quarter-truth, known as Ohm's Other Law, has served to increase the distrust with which perceptive musicians regard scientists, since it is readily apparent to them that the ear acts in this way only under very restricted conditions.|W.

{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2015}}
'''Participatory budgeting''' (PB) is a process of democratic [[deliberation]] and decision-making, in which ordinary people decide how to allocate part of a [[municipal]] or public [[budget]]. Participatory budgeting allows [[citizen]]s to identify, discuss, and prioritize public spending projects, and gives them the power to make real decisions about how money is spent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://theconversation.com/the-citizen-budgets-of-africa-make-governments-more-transparent-58275|first=Usman W.|last=Chohan|title=The 'citizen budgets' of Africa make governments more transparent| website=The Conversation|date=2016-04-20|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PB processes are typically designed to involve those left out of traditional methods of public engagement, such as low-income residents, non-citizens, and youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/who-we-are/mission-approach/|title=Mission &amp; Approach| website=Participatory Budgeting Project|date=2012-09-20|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive case study of eight municipalities in Brazil analyzing the successes and failures of participatory budgeting has suggested that it often results in more equitable public spending, greater government [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]] and accountability, increased levels of [[public participation]] (especially by marginalized or poorer residents), and democratic and citizenship learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-03252-8.html |title= Participatory Budgeting in Brazil |work= PSUpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frameworks of PB differentiate variously throughout the globe in terms of scale, procedure, and objective. PB, in its conception, is often contextualized to suit a region's particular conditions and needs. Thus, the magnitudes of PB vary depending on whether it is carried out at a municipal, regional, or provincial level. In many cases, PB has been legally enforced and regulated; however, some are internally arranged and promoted. Since the original invention in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 1988, PB has manifested itself in a myriad of designs, with variations in methodology, form, and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porto de Oliveira|first1=Osmany|title=Internatioanl Policy Diffusion and Participatory Budgeting: Ambassadors of Participation, International Institutional and Transnational Networks|date=January 10, 2017|publisher=Springer Nature|location=Cham, Switzerland|isbn=978-3-319-43337-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; PB stands as one of several democratic innovations such as [[Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform (British Columbia)|British Columbia's Citizens' Assembly]], encompassing the ideals of a [[participatory democracy]].&lt;ref name="Palgrave Macmillan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Röcke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9 |doi=10.1057/9781137326669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, PB has been implemented in nearly 1,500 municipalities and institutions around the world.&lt;ref name="Palgrave Macmillan"/&gt;

==Procedure==
Most broadly, all participatory budgeting schemes allow citizens to deliberate with the goal of creating either a concrete financial plan (a budget), or a recommendation to elected representatives. In the Porto Alegre model, the structure of the scheme gives subjurisdictions (neighborhoods) authority over the larger political jurisdiction (the city) of which they are part. Neighborhood budget committees, for example, have authority to determine the citywide budget, not just the allocation of resources for their particular neighborhood. There is, therefore, a need for mediating institutions to facilitate the aggregation of budget preferences expressed by subjurisdictions.

According to the World Bank Group, certain factors are needed for PB to be adopted: "[...]strong mayoral support, a civil society willing and able to contribute to ongoing policy debates, a generally supportive political environment that insulates participatory budgeting from legislators' attacks, and financial resources to fund the projects selected by citizens."&lt;ref name="Shah2007p24"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|page=24|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are generally two approaches through which PB formulates: top-down versus bottom-up. The adoption of PB has been required by the federal government in nations such as Peru, while there are cases where local governments initiated PB independent from the national agenda such as Porto Alegre. With the bottom-up approach, NGO's and local organizations have played crucial roles in mobilizing and informing the community members.&lt;ref name="Shah2007p24" /&gt;

PB processes do not adhere to strict rules, but they generally share several basic steps:&lt;ref name="Shah2007p26"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|page=26|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The municipality is divided geographically into multiple districts.
* Representatives of the divided districts are either elected or volunteered to work with government officials in a PB committee.
* The committees are established with regularly scheduled meetings under a specific timeline to deliberate. 
* Proposals, initiated by the citizens, are dealt under different branches of public budget such as recreation, infrastructure, transportation, etc.
* Participants publicly deliberate with the committee to finalize the projects to be voted on.
* The drafted budget is shared to the public and put for a vote. 
* The municipal government implements the top proposals.
* The cycle is repeated on an annual basis.

== History ==
[[File:Esquina democrática.jpg|thumb|right|Participatory budgeting has been practiced in [[Porto Alegre]] since 1989.]]

Participatory Budgeting was first developed in the 1980s by the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Brazilian Workers' Party]], drawing on the party's stated belief that electoral success is not an end in itself but a spring board for developing radical, participatory forms of democracy. While there were several early experiments (including the public budgeting practices of the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] in municipalities such as [[Pelotas]] &lt;ref name="Shah2007p92"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Participatory Budgeting|last=Shah|first=Anwar|publisher=The World Bank|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8213-6923-4|doi=10.1596/978-0-8213-6923-4|pages=92|url=http://hdrnet.org/498/1/br_27_56.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the first full participatory budgeting process was implemented in 1989, in the city of [[Porto Alegre|Porto Alegre, Brazil]], a capital city of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, and a busy industrial, financial, and service center, at that time with a population of 1.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making a People's Budget in Porto Alegre. NACLA Report On The Americas|last=Wainwright|first=H.|publisher=|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=36(5), 37–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial success of PB in Porto Alegre soon made it attractive to other municipalities. By 2001, more than 100 cities in Brazil had implemented PB, while in 2015, thousands of variations have been implemented in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title =How Participatory Budgeting Travels the Globe|issue = 2|url = http://www.publicdeliberation.net/jpd/vol8/iss2/art8/|journal = Journal of Public Deliberation|volume = 8|accessdate = 2015-11-17|date = 2012-12-30|last1 = Ganuza|first1 = Ernesto|last2 = Baiocchi|first2 = Gianpaolo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Porto Alegre===

In its [[Constitution of Brazil#Title 1|first Title]], the [[History of the Constitution of Brazil#Citizen Constitution .281988 .E2.80.93 present.29|1988 Constitution of Brazil]] states that "All power originates from the people, who exercise it by the means of elected representatives or directly, according to the terms of this Constitution." The authoring of the Constitution was a reaction to the previous twenty years of [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]], and the new Constitution sought to secure individual liberty while also decentralizing and democratizing ruling power, in the hope that authoritarian dictatorship would not reemerge.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://pas.sagepub.com/content/26/4/511.short|title = From Clientelism to Cooperation: Local Government, Participatory Policy, and Civic Organizing in Porto Alegre, Brazil|last = Abers|first = Jessica|date = 1998|journal = Politics &amp; Society|doi = 10.1177/0032329298026004004|pmid = |access-date = 15 November 2015|pages = 511–537|volume=26|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil's contemporary [[political economy]] is an outgrowth of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese empire's]] patrimonial capitalism, where "power was not exercised according to rules, but was structured through personal relationships".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Participatory Budgeting in Porto Alegre: Social Innovation and the Dialectical Relationship of State and Civil Society|url = http://usj.sagepub.com/content/42/11/2023|journal = Urban Studies|date = 2005-10-01|issn = 0042-0980|pages = 2023–2036|volume = 42|issue = 11|doi = 10.1080/00420980500279828|first = Andreas|last = Novy|first2 = Bernhard|last2 = Leubolt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Athenian democracy|Athenian ideal of democracy]], in which all citizens participate directly and decide policy collectively, Brazil's government is structured as a [[republic]] with [[Representative democracy|elected representatives]]. This institutional arrangement has created a separation between the state and [[civil society]], which has opened the doors for [[clientelism]]. Because the law-making process occurs behind closed doors, elected officials and bureaucrats can access state resources in ways that benefit certain 'clients', typically those of extraordinary social or economic relevance. The influential clients receive policy favors, and repay elected officials with votes from the groups they influence. For example, a neighborhood leader represents the views of shop owners to the local party boss, asking for laws to increase foot traffic on commercial streets. In exchange, the neighborhood leader mobilizes shop owners to vote for the political party responsible for the policy. Because this patronage operates on the basis of individual ties between patron and clients, true decision-making power is limited to a small network of party bosses and influential citizens rather than the broader public.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Participatory Budgeting in Porto Alegre: Toward a Redistributive Democracy|url = http://pas.sagepub.com/content/26/4/461|journal = Politics &amp; Society|date = 1998-12-01|issn = 0032-3292|pages = 461–510|volume = 26|issue = 4|doi = 10.1177/0032329298026004003|first = BOAVENTURA de SOUSA|last = Santos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, [[Olívio Dutra]] won the mayor's seat in Porto Alegre. In an attempt to encourage popular participation in government and redirect government resources towards the poor, Dutra institutionalized the PT's organizational structure on a citywide level. The result is one example of what we now know as Participatory Budgeting.

=== Outcomes ===
A [[World Bank]] paper suggests that participatory budgeting has led to direct improvements in facilities in Porto Alegre. For example, [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] and water connections increased from 75% of households in 1988 to 98% in 1997. The number of [[school]]s quadrupled since 1986.{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003|p=2}}

The high number of participants, after more than a decade, suggests that participatory budgeting encourages increasing citizen involvement, according to the paper. Also, Porto Alegre's health and education budget increased from 13% (1985) to almost 40% (1996), and the share of the participatory budget in the total budget increased from 17% (1992) to 21% (1999).{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003|p=3}} In a paper that updated the World Bank's methodology, expanding statistical scope and analyzing Brazil's 253 largest municipalities that use participatory budgeting, researchers found that participatory budgeting reallocates spending towards health and sanitation. Health and sanitation benefits accumulated the longer participatory budgeting was used in a municipality. Participatory budgeting does not merely allow citizens to shift funding priorities in the short-term – it can yield sustained institutional and political change in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cps.sagepub.com/content/47/10/1442.full?keytype=ref&amp;siteid=spcps&amp;ijkey=qPmuzabskSFkQ |title= Improving Social Well-Being Through New Democratic Institutions |accessdate=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper concludes that participatory budgeting can lead to improved conditions for the [[Poverty|poor]]. Although it cannot overcome wider problems such as [[unemployment]], it leads to "noticeable improvement in the accessibility and quality of various [[public welfare]] amenities".{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003|p=1}}

Based on Porto Alegre more than 140 (about 2.5%) of the 5,571 municipalities in Brazil have adopted participatory budgeting.{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003}}{{Page needed |date=October 2015}}

==Implementation &amp; Policy Diffusion==
As of 2015, over 1,500 instances of PB have been implemented across the five continents.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While the democratic spirit of PB remains the same throughout the world, institutional variations abound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Budgets for the People|url = https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-03-11/budgets-people|journal = Foreign Affairs|accessdate = 2015-11-17|date = 2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Peru have implemented participatory budgeting in all local governments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.watsonblogs.org/participatorybudgeting/historypb.html |title=History|work= The Participatory Budgeting Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of towns and cities in [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], and [[Spain]] have also initiated participatory budgeting processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = de | title = Volumen zwei: Endbericht Bürgerhaushalt Europa 5 |trans-title = Volume two | format = PDF | place = [[Germany|DE]] | publisher = Bürgerhaushalt Europa | url = http://www.buergerhaushalt-europa.de/documents/Volumen_zwei_Endbericht_Buergerhaushalt_Europa5.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]], participatory budgeting has been implemented with public housing, neighbourhood groups, and a public schools, in the cities of [[Toronto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontohousing.ca/participatory_budgeting|title= Participatory Budgeting – Working together, making a difference | publisher = Toronto Community Housing}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guelph]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = PB Hamilton, Ontario | url = http://pbhamont.ca/ | place = [[Canada|CA]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[West Vancouver]]. Since its emergence in Porto Alegre, participatory budgeting has spread to hundreds of [[Latin America]]n cities, and dozens of cities in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[North America]]. In some cities, participatory budgeting has been applied for school, university, and public housing budgets. In France, the Region [[Poitou-Charentes]] is notable for launching participatory budgeting in its secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Poitou-Charentes' participatory budget in the high schools | type = wiki | contribution-url = http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Poitou-Charentes%27_participatory_budget_in_the_highschools | title = Participedia}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  These international approaches differ significantly, and they are shaped as much by their local contexts as by the Porto Alegre model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Participatory budgeting | publisher = CFE | url = http://www.cfe.org.uk/uploaded/files/Participatory%20Budgeting.pdf | format = PDF | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
Participatory budgeting in [[Porto Alegre]] occurs annually, starting with a series of neighborhood, regional, and citywide assemblies, where residents and elected budget delegates identify spending priorities and vote on which priorities to implement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Cite journal | date = December 31, 2002 |url= http://www.yesmagazine.org/article.asp?ID=562 |title = Porto Alegre's Budget Of, By, and For the People | first = David | last = Lewit |journal= Yes! Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porto Alegre spends about 200 million dollars per year on construction and services, this money is subject to participatory budgeting.  Annual spending on fixed expenses, such as debt service and pensions, is not subject to public participation. Around fifty thousand residents of Porto Alegre now take part in the participatory budgeting process (compared to 1.5 million city inhabitants), with the number of participants growing year on year since 1989. Participants are from diverse economic and political backgrounds.&lt;ref name= autogenerated2 /&gt;

The participatory budgeting cycle starts in January and assemblies across the city facilitate maximum participation and interaction. Each February there is instruction from city specialists in technical and system aspects of city budgeting. In March there are plenary assemblies in each of the city's 16 districts as well as assemblies dealing with such areas as transportation, health, education, sports, and economic development.  These large meetings—with participation that can reach over 1,000—elect delegates to represent specific neighborhoods. The mayor and staff attend to respond to citizen concerns. In the following months, delegates meet weekly or biweekly in each district to review technical project criteria and district needs. City department staff may participate according to their area of expertise. At a second regional plenary, regional delegates prioritize the district's demands and elect 42 councillors representing all districts and thematic areas to serve on the Municipal Council of the Budget. The main function of the Municipal Council of the Budget is to reconcile the demands of each district with available resources, and to propose and approve an overall municipal budget.  The resulting budget is binding, though the city council can suggest, but not require changes. Only the Mayor may veto the budget, or remand it back to the Municipal Council of the Budget (this has never happened).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

=== Argentina ===
The city of Rosario&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rosario.gov.ar/web/gobierno/presupuestos/presupuesto-participativo/resultados-del-presupuesto-participativo-2018|title=Resultados del Presupuesto Participativo 2018|website=Sitio de la Municipalidad de Rosario|language=es|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Argentina mixed participatory budgeting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.citizenlab.co/blog/civic-engagement/participatory-budgeting/what-if-citizens-set-city-budgets-with-participatory-budgeting/|title=What if citizens set the city budgets? - CitizenLab|website=www.citizenlab.co|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an approach called ‘gender budgeting’. In practice it means taking appropriate actions to involve more women in the participatory budgeting process, and to make all participants more sensitive of gender issues and the impact of the participatory budgeting projects on these issues.

===United States of America &amp; Canada===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

The first recorded Participatory Budgeting process in the United States of America is in the [[Rogers Park, Chicago|Rogers Park]] neighborhood of [[Chicago]], Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 2010-05-27 | url = http://permaculture.org.au/2010/05/27/chicagos-1-3-million-experiment-in-democracy/|title= Chicago's $1.3 Million Experiment in Democracy | place = [[Australia|AU]] | publisher = The Permaculture Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Yes Magazine | date = April 10, 2010 | title = Chicago's $1.3 Million Experiment in Democracy; For the First Time in the US, the City's 49th Ward Lets Taxpayers Directly Decide How Public Money is Spent | url = http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/chicagos-1.3-million-experiment-in-democracy| last1 = Lerner | first1 = Josh }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Led by the ward's Alderman, Joe Moore, Chicago's 49th Ward is undertaking this process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ward49.com/participatory-budgeting/ |title= Participatory budgeting | place = Chicago | publisher = 49th Ward|accessdate= April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Alderman's "Menu Money."  Menu Money is a yearly budgeted amount each of Chicago's 50 wards receives for use on capital expenses. This money in other wards is typically allocated at the complete discretion of a ward's Alderman. Since 2011 more examples have been occurring in the US, in [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://pbnyc.org/ |title=Participatory budgeting in New York City |accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now [[Participatory budgeting in Vallejo, California|citywide in Vallejo, California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Public policy | url = http://publicpolicy.pepperdine.edu/davenport-institute/incommon/index.php/2012/04/city-wide-pb-in-vallejo-ca/ | publisher = Pepperdine | title= Participatory budgeting city wide in Vallejo, CA |accessdate= April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently in [[Greensboro, NC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.greensboro-nc.gov/index.aspx?page=4796 | publisher = City of Greensboro| title= City of Greensboro NC: Participatory Budgeting |accessdate= December 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Boston, the first youth-led participatory budgeting process in the US allows teens to decide how to spend $1 million of the city's budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://youth.boston.gov/youth-lead-the-change/|title=Participatory Budgeting Boston|last=|first=|date=|website=Youth Lead the Change|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Municipal Processes ====

===== Cambridge, Massachusetts =====
Cambridge's first PB occurred in 2014-2015, with $528,000 allocated towards the implementation of six winning projects. Winning projects included one hundred healthy trees, twenty laptops for a community center, bilingual books for children learning english, a public bathroom in Central Square, bike report stations, and free public wifi in six outdoor locations.

===== New York City =====
New York City's Participatory Budgeting process (PBNYC) is the largest in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://council.nyc.gov/html/pr/092115launch.shtml|title=Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and New York City Council Launch 2015-2016 Participatory Budgeting Cycle|last=|first=|date=|website=New York City Council|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process began in 2011-2012 as a pilot program in four City Council districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/about-participatory-budgeting/examples-of-participatory-budgeting/|title=Examples of PB|last=|first=|date=|website=Participatory Budgeting Project|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its sixth year (2016-2017), PBNYC has grown to include 31 of the city's 51 districts. Community members in each district decide how to spend at least $1 million of their City Council member's discretionary funds.&lt;ref name="Participate"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://labs.council.nyc/pb/participate/|title=Participate|website=New York City Council|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PBNYC cycles run from early fall through the spring. Districts hold neighborhood meetings to collect ideas for community improvement projects. Idea collection is focused particularly on hard-to-reach communities, such as immigrants with limited English proficiency, youth, senior citizens, and public housing residents. Volunteers then research community needs and work with city agencies to turn ideas into concrete proposals. The proposals are put to a community vote, which is open to any resident of the district over the age of 14. City agencies implement the winning projects.&lt;ref name="Participate"/&gt;

==== Housing Complex Processes ====

===== Toronto (Canada) =====
In Toronto Community Housing, PB is part of a broader "tenant participation system." PB has been a part of Toronto Community Housing since 2001. This inspired the launch of a three-year pilot of PB at the ward-level in Toronto, beginning in 2015. In the months of May and June 2018 the city will begin debating what to do with PB at the municipal-level, following annual evaluations of the pilot. Thirty-seven projects have been voted for through the entirety of the three-year pilot process, comprising a total of $1.8 million in residents directly allocating funds towards projects.

===== New York City =====
Citing the case of Toronto, Community Voices Heard (CVH) has called for PB within the [[New York City Housing Authority]] (NYCHA). As part of a platform for democratizing and improving access to public housing, CVH has advocated for developing a kind of participatory system tied together by PB. CVH also advocates for a gradual increase of money being allocated through PB as residents become increasingly familiarized with the process.

===== Los Angeles =====
As part of a broader platform for pushing greater investment and public housing, in early 2014 the LA Human Right to Housing collective began advocating for the use of PB in the [[Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles]] (HACLA). This was in response to a budget corruption scandal in November 2012 in HACLA.According to the Collective, nearly one-hundred residents mobilized to demand PB at a HACLA Agency Plan hearing in August 2014. In response, HACLA launched a "values driven participatory budgeting process" developed and coordinated by a consultant. This was a six-week process, consisting of "resident consultation" that fed into decisions ultimately made by administration and management. Participatory elements of the process were "a resident survey" and "resident review of site specific budgets." The Collective regarded both the design and distribution of the survey to be unsatisfactory. Coupled with a lack of technical support, any kind of resident-focused collective deliberation or evidence of resident influence on the outcome of the process, the Collective deemed the process "participatory in name only."

To counter this, the Collective sought to scale up their campaign for a "true participatory budgeting" process by initiating a Model PB process. The process included a combination of one-on-one and door-to-door outreach with deliberation through meetings and assemblies of residents. The Model PB process resulted in tenants and the Collective deepening their critique of HACLA's PB "in name only" as well as putting forward a number of recommendations to create a "true PB" process.

==== Youth, School, and College Processes ====

===== Greater Boston Area =====
Since 2014 a youth PB process has operated in the city of Boston. Today the process allows persons aged between 12 and 25 years old to decide how to allocate one million dollars.

In 2013-2014 MIT's International Development Group within the school's Department of Urban Studies and Planning conducted an $8,000 PB process. Voting was not over allocating money to specific project proposals, but rather to determining exact allotments to four broad distinct budget categories: field trips, social events, project funding, and cultural event series. To determine precise allotments, "each participant allocated a percentage value of the $8,000 to each category. The average for each category was taken and a preliminary set of results was disclosed." The MIT intra-departmental process provides an example of how PB can be utilized to not only determine the allocation of funds within a specific budget category, but also to determine how funds are distributed across budget categories.

===== Chicago =====
In Spring 2015 Sullivan High School conducted a $25,000 participatory budgeting process. Seventy percent of the student body voted in the process, with the money allocated towards building a new recreation room.

===== New York =====
Within PBNYC youth participation has been semi-formalized in various forms. This includes the youth-led formation of the District 39 PB Youth Committee. District 3 also possesses a PB Youth Committee December 2015, which works in collaboration with an organization called Friends of the High Line. In his State of the City address, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that PB would be launched in every public high school. Each participating school will receive $2,000 for students to allocate through PB. PB has also been launched at various colleges in the City University of New York. These have included Queens College, Brooklyn College, City Tech, Hunter College, and the CUNY Graduate Center.

===== Phoenix =====
Ten high schools allocated $55,000 of district-wide funds in Phoenix through PB.

===== San Antonio =====
In 2013 a $25,000 PB process was launched at Palo Alto Community College. Initially this was only open to faculty and staff. In fall 2015 the process was opened to students as well. The 2018 process expanded the pot of funds from $25,000 to $50,000.

===United Kingdom===

PB in the United Kingdom was initially introduced as part of the 'New Labour' Party's decentralization agenda that aimed to empower the local governments in the first decade of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hazel Blears]], the Labour MP, "[...] played a key role in the inclusion of PB on the national policy agenda[...]," pushing for greater community participation and empowerment in the governmental structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this new political ambiance, the British PB, inspired by Porto Alegre's example, gained traction for implementation, especially through the active engagement of local NGO's and community activists, namely the Community Pride Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt at PB was initiated as a pilot in the city of [[Bradford]] in 2004, and its "procedural model consists of two main steps: the elaboration of project schemes by local community groups and a decision about these schemes by all involved groups during a public meeting."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bradford process, while limited to small funding, helped PB spread to other cities such as [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In addition to the bottom-up activism in local communities, Blears's initiative for PB on the national level helped promote its implementation and diffusion more broadly, and by 2011, there were at least 150 recorded cases of PB, albeit being limited to small funding and designated personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "UK style" of PB, as Anja Rocke puts it, "in form of small grant-spending processes with no secured financial basis and organized at the margins of the political system," failed to gain enough momentum to be established nationally as a formal decision-making procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Scotland ====
The [[Scottish Government]] has made a commitment to participatory budgeting, saying "We support PB as a tool for community engagement and for developing participatory democracy in Scotland".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.gov.scot/policies/community-empowerment/participatory-budgeting/|title=Community empowerment: Participatory budgeting - gov.scot|website=beta.gov.scot|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Scottish Government and the [[Convention of Scottish Local Authorities]] have agreed that at least 1% of local government budgets will be subject to participatory budgeting by the end of 2021, potentially amounting to £100million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.gov.scot/news/more-choice-for-communities|title=More choice for communities|website=Scottish Government News|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish Government allocates funding for participatory budgeting through the Community Choices Fund, delivered in partnership between the Government, local authorities, communities and third sector organisations.

===== Support and tools =====
There is a national network to support participatory budgeting called the [https://pbscotland.scot/network PB Scotland Network]. Glasgow Community Planning Partnership has worked with What Works Scotland to develop a toolkit to assess the impact of its PB activities and develop an improvement plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whatworksscotland.ac.uk/publications/glasgows-participatory-budgeting-evaluation-toolkit/|title=Glasgow's Participatory Budgeting Evaluation Toolkit {{!}} What Works Scotland|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the national government revised its Local Finance Act to promote citizen participation in the local government budgeting process in response to a few of the local governments that initially took a bottom-up approach in experimenting with forms of PB.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Soonhee|title=Participatory Governance and Polcy Diffusion in Local Governments in Korea: Implementation of Participatory Budgeting|date=January 2016|publisher=Korea Development institute|location=Sejong-si, Korea|isbn=979-11-5932-106-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Ministry of Security and Public Administration invested in the nation-wide promotion of PB system diffusion, and under [[Myung Bak Lee|Myung Bak Lee's]] Administration in 2011, the newly revised Local Finance Act required all local governments to adopt PB.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"/&gt;

Before the 2011 decree, approximately 45% of local governments had already been utilizing the PB system, and it took 3 years for the remaining municipalities to fulfill the mandate.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"/&gt; The PB System of [[Seoul Metropolitan Government]] served as the benchmark for other local governments' adoption of PB in those years.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"/&gt; Seoul, city with the world's 4th highest GDP, runs a PB committee of 300 people representing 25 districts. The committee is then split into 11 different budgetary fields such as parks and recreation, culture, environment, and etc. In its first year, Seoul citizens voted and finalized on 223 projects worth 50.3 billion KRW, and most recently in 2017, the PB system finalized 766 projects amounting to 59.3 billion KRW (approximately 55 million USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=참여예산제|url=http://yesan.seoul.go.kr/intro/index.do|website=서울특별시 시민참여예산|publisher=서울특별시청|accessdate=10 March 2018| language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive study of Korea's PB in 2016 suggests that PB in Korea has allocated most of public budget to the following three areas: land/local development, transportation, and culture and tourism. Transparency in budget documents and information sharing has increased since 2011, and the approval rates by local PB committees averaged to approximately 70%. On the other hand, the study also points out that the lack of citizen capacity, inadequate resources for smaller municipalities, and limited representativeness of vested interests as some of the most unresolved challenges in Korea's PB implementation.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"/&gt;

===India===

India's experience with PB has been limited despite its 74th Constitutional Amendment, which proposes to the state and local governments the formation of ward committees composed of local citizens to direct ward-level budgets.&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keruwala|first1=Naim|title=Participatory Budgeting in India-The Pune Experiment|journal=The Budget Bulletin|date=June–August 2013|volume=V|url=http://www.nfi.org.in/sites/default/files/newsletter/THE%20BUDGET%20BULLETIN_1.pdf|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such initiative was not implemented, and thus there were only few cities that experimented with PB, which are [[Bangalore]], [[Myso]], [[Pune]], and [[Hiware Bazar]].&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013" /&gt;

Bangalore was the first to implement PB in India in 2001 with the help of a local NGO. Similarly, Pune was able to adopt PB in 2006 with the help of several local NGOs. Pune's PB system was met with a large response from its local citizens, and multiple online and offline workshops were carried out to foster the implementation&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013" /&gt; As a result, Pune has experienced both increased citizen participation and budget allocation, which are directed primarily towards roads, electricity, slum-improvement, and water shortage.&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013" /&gt; Influenced by Pune's PB, Pimpri-Chinchwad, the fifth-most populated city of Maharashtra, also began to adopt the framework soon after.&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013" /&gt;

Hiware Bazar may have served as the most successful example of PB in India. On June 25, 2015, Delhi Deputy chief Minister Manish Sisodia presented the Swaraj Budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Highlights of Swaraj budget presented by deeputy CM SH Manish Sisodia | url = http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/highlights-of-swaraj-budget-presented-by-deputy-cm-sh-manish-sisodia | publisher = Aam Admi party}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Aam Admi Party Swaraj Budget was prepared based on voting from the people of different constituencies. In each constituency three meetings were held; each meeting  was attended by 200–300 residents, and a list of key issues was prepared, which was then voted on to decide the top priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The Times of India | publisher = India Times | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Aam-aadmi-gives-Swaraj-budget-a-thumbs-up/articleshow/46981634.cms | title = Aam Admi gives Swaraj budget a thumbs up}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=qk6YyKRRIk0C&amp;pg=PT3 |title=Swaraj |work= Books |isbn=9789350299371 |last1=Kejriwal |first1=Arvind |date=2012-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/page/goal-of-swaraj|title=Goal of Swaraj | publisher = Aam Aadmi Party}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the village, once bereft of water, education, and basic needs for life, is now self-sufficient with a high per capita income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Dhara|first1=Sagar|title=Including People in Governance|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/including-people-in-governance/article6483234.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===

For South Africa, the mechanisms for citizen participation is written in its constitution. Each municipality has its budgetary committee formed with representatives from its 'wards' that deal directly with its budgeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank Group's research lists [[Mangaung]] and [[Ekurhuleni]] municipalities as representative cases to demonstrate the typical PB process in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the process for the council is fixed by the mayor, who sets up certain deadlines for the council to deliberate within.&lt;ref name="Participatory Budgeting"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|pages=207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the municipality is divided geographically into 'wards', and  the public budget is drawn with any desired submission from the community through their ward representatives.&lt;ref name="Participatory Budgeting"/&gt; The tentatively accumulated budget plan is then publicized so that any citizens or "stakeholders" can make their final inputs, and the final version is submitted to the national and provincial governments for approval.&lt;ref name="Participatory Budgeting"/&gt;

On a nation-wide level, the South African municipalities, as a result of PB, have witnessed the public budget "shift from infrastructure development to local economic development, a higher priority for citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, PB is being carried out in 284 municipalities, each varying slightly in its process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of transparency for the municipal governments has increased because the sub-organization ward committees are able to maintain consistently ongoing communication with the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the challenges in South African local governance still prevail as a result of the lack of resources and limited capacities assigned to PB. Furthermore, language barriers and cultural differences also provide immediate obstacles for holistic communications between various wards and social groups within the municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iceland===
The Better Neighbourhoods participatory budgeting project of the wider [[citizen sourcing]] Better Reykjavik project of the City of Reykjavik was established in 2011. Nearly 2 million Euros (300 million ISK) has been allocated each year with over citizen proposed 100 projects funded most years. The project is mostly driven by digital participation with secure electronic voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citizens.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Better-Neighbourhoods-Participatory-budgeting-in-Reykjavik-2011-2015.pdf|title=Better Neighborhoods 2011 to 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=Citizens Foundation|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/754a9442-af7b-11e7-8076-0a4bdda92ca2|title=The world watches Reykjavik's digital democracy experiment|last=|first=|date=|website=Financial Times|publisher=Financial Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buenos Aires===
Buenos Aires adopted the PB process in 2001 hoping to emerge a political economy. There were manipulators like people watching the system and third parties forming for or against the PB system. Buenos aires used a system where the communities allocated where the government would take action first by ranking where the cities resources would go. After participation decreased by 50% in the 2005 cycle, PB came to an end and "the new communes" emerged.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Reviewing the experience in Brazil and Porto Alegre a [[World Bank]] paper points out that lack of representation of extremely poor people in participatory budgeting can be a shortcoming. Participation of the very poor and of the young is highlighted as a challenge.{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003|p=5}} What are the insights regarding the opportunities for and barriers to accomplishing the goal of participatory-based budgeting? It takes leadership to flatten the organizational structure and make conscious ethical responsibilities as individuals and as committee members try to achieve the democratic goals means that the press should be present for the public, and yet the presence of the press inhibits the procedural need for robust discussion. Or, while representation is a cornerstone to participatory budgeting, a group being so large has an effect on the efficiency of the group. Participatory budgeting may also struggle to overcome existing [[clientelism]]. Other observations include that particular groups are less likely to participate once their demands have been met and that slow progress of public works can frustrate participants.{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003}}{{Page needed |date=October 2015}}

In Chicago, participatory budgeting has been criticized for increasing funding to recreational projects while allocating less to infrastructure projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2017/04/24/pitfalls-participatory-budgeting|title=The Pitfalls of Participatory Budgeting|last=|first=|date=|work=Chicago Tonight {{!}} WTTW|access-date=2017-12-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, these lanes are in front of the houses and businesses, and streets for motor vehicles are always at the rear. Some pedestrian villages might be nearly car-free with cars either hidden below the buildings or on the periphery of the village. [[Venice, Italy]] is essentially a pedestrian village with canals.

The '''President's Medal''' is awarded annually by the [[British Academy]] to up to five individuals or organisations. It is awarded for "outstanding service to the cause of the humanities and social sciences". It cannot be awarded to [[Fellows of the British Academy]] and was created to reward "academic-related activity rather than academic achievement alone". The medals were first awarded in 2010.&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite web|title=The British Academy President's Medal|url=http://www.britac.ac.uk/british-academy-presidents-medal|website=British Academy|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|200px|Plato and Aristotle]]

'''''Rhema''''' (ῥῆμα in [[Koine Greek|Greek]]) literally means an "utterance" or "thing said" in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;''The handbook of linguistics'' by Mark Aronoff, Janie Rees-Miller 2003 {{ISBN|1-4051-0252-7}} page 83 [https://books.google.com/books?id=rl8LDiR11nYC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=rhema+utterance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZvJ4TKqBNIag4Qa7tqm5Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20utterance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a word that signifies the action of utterance.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sophists (A History of Greek Philosophy, Vol. 3, Part 1)'' by W. K. C. Guthrie 1977 {{ISBN|0-521-09666-9}} page 220 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pDOqZfQ5tqUC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=rhema&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bvF4TLqoCoaG4Qb9zr27Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBzg8#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], it was used by both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] to refer to [[proposition]]s or sentences.&lt;ref name="Dinneen"/&gt;

In [[Christianity]], it is used in reference to the concept of ''Rhematos Christou''; Jesus Christ's sayings.

==Etymology==
The Greek noun [[wikt:ῥῆμα|ῥῆμα]] "saying, utterance, word, verb" is analyzed as consisting of the root ἐρ-/ῥε- (er-/rhe-) "say" (cf. [[wikt:εἴρω|εἴρω]] "I say"; ἐρῶ "I will say") and the suffix -μα (-ma), a suffix used to form nouns from verbs.

==Greek philosophers==
&lt;small&gt;
{| align="right" border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"
| LOGIC || ARISTOTLE || GRAMMAR
|-
| subject || onoma || noun
|-
| predicate || rhema || verb
|-
| proposition || logos || sentence 
|-
|}&lt;/small&gt;

Both [[Plato]] (c. 428–347 BC) and [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) used the terms ''logos'', ''rhema'' and ''onoma''. In Plato's usage, a [[logos]] (often translatable as a ''sentence'') is a sequence in which verbs are mingled with nouns and every logos must have an onoma and rhema. For Plato, every logos was either true or false and in a logos, names included rhema ''which denotes actions'' and onoma a ''mark set on those who do the actions''.&lt;ref name="Dinneen"&gt;''General linguistics'' by Francis P. Dinneen 1995 {{ISBN|0-87840-278-0}} page 118 [https://books.google.com/books?id=H8njxDzC450C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BEt4TOXbGMqSswb1v_yxDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCDgo#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle identified three components as central to the proposition: ''onoma'', ''rhema'' and ''logos''. These terms are translated differently depending on the context of the discussion—grammar or logic, as in the table on the right. But it was only in the 12th century that grammarians began to think in terms of units we understand as ''subject'' and ''predicate''.&lt;ref&gt;''The history of linguistics in Europe from Plato to 1600'' by Vivien Law 2003 {{ISBN|0-521-56532-4}} page 29 [https://books.google.com/books?id=M_ooh9Q9cDMC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3Up4TPWLA-DT4wallLWvBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Septuagint usage==
The [[Septuagint]] translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] into Greek uses the terms ''rhema'' and ''logos'' as equivalents and uses both for the [[Hebrew]] word ''[[dabar]]'', as the Word of God.&lt;ref&gt;''Theological dictionary of the New Testament, Volume 1'' by Gerhard Kittel, Gerhard Friedrich, Geoffrey William Bromiley 1985 {{ISBN|0-8028-2404-8}} page 508 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ltZBUW_F9ogC&amp;pg=PA508&amp;dq=dabar+rhema&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nhR5TOrOBtuT4gbY9uyrBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dabar%20rhema&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: Q-Z'' by Geoffrey W.

==In Christianity==
{{Main article|Rhema (doctrine)}}
In Christianity, ''rhema'' is used in [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] to signify Jesus Christ's utterances.{{cn|date=April 2018}} The Greek word ''rhema'' is useful to distinguish between two meanings of ''word''. While both ''rhema'' and ''logos'' are translated into the English ''word'', in the original Greek there was a substantial distinction.

Some modern usage distinguishes ''rhema'' from ''logos'' in [[Christian theology]], with ''rhema'' at times called "spoken word",&lt;ref name="Rogers"/&gt; referring to the revelation received by disciples when the  [[Holy Spirit]] "speaks" to them.&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;''What Every Christian Ought to Know'' by Adrian Rogers 2005 {{ISBN|0-8054-2692-2}} page 162 [https://books.google.com/books?id=W0os7ZiHsf0C&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=rhema+utterance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZvJ4TKqBNIag4Qa7tqm5Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20utterance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Identified Life of Christ'' by Joe Norvell 2006 {{ISBN|1-59781-294-3}} page [https://books.google.com/books?id=3FAhz_eshkMC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PEp4TLvMKtH14AaetLmABg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In this usage, "Logos" refers to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''The Trinitarian controversy'' by William G.

'''Social determinism''' is the theory that social interactions and constructs alone determine individual behavior (as opposed to biological or objective factors).

Consider certain [[human behavior]]s, such as committing murder, or writing poetry.  A social determinist would look only at social phenomena, such as customs and expectations, education, and interpersonal interactions, to decide whether or not a given person would exhibit any of these behaviors. They would discount biological and other non-social factors, such as [[Genetics|genetic]] makeup, the physical environment, etc. Ideas about nature and biology would be considered to be [[Social construction|socially constructed]].

== Social determinism and ideology ==
The socially determined actions of an individual can be influenced by forces that control the flow of ideas. By creating an [[ideology]] within the society of the individual, the individual's actions and reactions to [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]] are predetermined to adhere to the [[social rules]] imposed on him/her. Ideologies can be created using social institutions such as schooling, which "have become the terrain upon which contending forces express their social and political interest" (Mayberry 3), or the mass media, which has "significant power in shaping the social agenda and framing of public opinion to support that agenda" (Colaguori 35).

By creating a social construction of reality, these forces directly create a [[hegemonic]] control over the future of individuals who feel like the social construct is natural and therefore unchangeable. Their actions become based in the context of their society so that, even if they possess an innate talent for a sport, if the social construction implies that their race is unathletic in general, or their nation or state does not produce athletes, they do not include the possibility of athleticism in their future. Their society has successfully determined their actions.

Social determinism can favor a political party's agenda by setting social rules so that the individual considers the party's agenda to be morally correct, an example being the 2010 G20 summit riots in Toronto. The media, controlled by corporations and the governments with agendas of their own, publicizes the riots as violent and dangerous, but the goal of the rioters, to rebel against those whose position in power enables them to abuse the system for personal gain, is lost because the focus is on the violence. The individuals' view on the subject are then directly influenced by the media and their reactions are predetermined by that social form of control. "We have been taught to think that censorship is the main mechanism of how the media uses information as a form of social control, but in fact what ''is'' said, and how it is ''selectively presented'', is a far more powerful form of information control." (Colaguori 35).

Social determinism was first studied by [[Emile Durkheim]] (1858 - 1917), French philosopher considered as the father of the social science.

== Social determinism ==
Social determinism is most commonly understood in opposition to [[biological determinism]]. Within the [[media studies]] discipline, however, social determinism is understood as the counterpart of technological determinism.
[[Technological determinism]] is the notion that technological change and development is inevitable, and that the characteristics of any given technology determine the way it is used by the society in which it is developed. The concept of technological determinism is dependent upon the premise that social changes come about as a result of the new capabilities that new technologies enable.

The notion of social determinism opposes this perspective. Social determinism perceives technology as a result of the society in which it is developed. A number of contemporary media theorists have provided persuasive accounts of social determinism, including Leila Green.

In her book ''Technoculture'' Leila Green examines in detail the workings of a social determinist perspective, and argues “social processes determine technology for social purposes”. {{Harv|Green|2001}} She claims that every technological development throughout history was born of a social need, be this need economical, political or military. {{Harv|Green|2001}}

According to Green, technology is always developed with a particular purpose or objective in mind. As the development of technology is necessarily facilitated by financial funding, a social determinist perspective recognizes that technology is always developed to benefit those who are capable of funding its development.

Thus social determinists perceive that technological development is not only determined by the society in which it occurs, but that it is inevitably shaped by the power structures that exist in that society. {{Harv|Green|2001}}

==Arguments against social determinism==
{{Original research|date=December 2017}}
Scientific studies have shown that [[social behavior]] is partly inherited and can influence infants and also even influence foetuses. Wired to be social means that infants are not taught that they are social beings, but they are born as prepared social beings. The infants are born with an inherited social skill.

Social pre-wiring deals with the study of fetal social behavior and social interactions in a multi-fetal environment. Specifically, social pre-wiring refers to the [[ontogeny]] of [[social relation|social interaction]]. Also informally referred to as, "wired to be social." The theory questions whether there is a propensity to [[social actions|socially oriented action]] already present ''before'' birth. Research in the theory concludes that newborns are born into the world with a unique [[genetics|genetic]] wiring to be social.&lt;ref name="Wired"&gt;https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2951360/ Umberto Castiello, et al: National Institutes of Health&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumstantial evidence supporting the social pre-wiring hypothesis can be revealed when examining newborns' behavior. Newborns, not even hours after birth, have been found to display a preparedness for [[social relation|social interaction]]. This preparedness is expressed in ways such as their imitation of facial gestures. This observed behavior cannot be contributed to any current form of [[socialization]] or [[social construction]]. Rather, newborns most likely [[heredity|inherit]] to some extent [[social behavior]] and [[identity (social science)|identity]] through [[genetics]].&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

Principal evidence of this theory is uncovered by examining Twin pregnancies. The main argument is, if there are [[social behavior]]s that are [[heredity|inherited]] and developed before birth, then one should expect twin foetuses to engage in some form of [[social relation|social interaction]] before they are born. Thus, ten foetuses were analyzed over a period of time using ultrasound techniques. Using kinematic analysis, the results of the experiment were that the twin foetuses would interact with each other for longer periods and more often as the pregnancies went on. Researchers were able to conclude that the performance of movements between the co-twins were not accidental but specifically aimed.&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

The social pre-wiring hypothesis was proved correct, "The central advance of this study is the demonstration that '[[social actions]]' are already performed in the second trimester of [[gestational age|gestation]]. Starting from the 14th week of [[gestational age|gestation]] twin foetuses plan and execute movements specifically aimed at the co-twin. These findings force us to predate the emergence of [[social behavior]]: when the context enables it, as in the case of twin foetuses, other-directed actions are not only possible but predominant over self-directed actions.".&lt;ref name="Wired"/&gt;

'''Substantive rights''' are basic [[human rights]] possessed by people in an ordered [[society]] and include [[rights]] granted by [[natural law]] as well as the [[substantive law]]. Substantive rights involve a right to the substance of being human (life, liberty, happiness), rather than a right to a procedure to enforce that right, which is defined by [[procedural law]].

The '''Sunbury Research Centre''' -- also known as ICBT Sunbury -- is a main [[research institute]] of [[BP]] in north-east [[Surrey]].

==History==
It began in 1917 as the Sunbury Research Station. Research began with the employment of two chemists to look into the [[viscosity]] of [[fuel oil]] for the [[Navy]] in the [[First World War]], and the production of [[toluene]]. In the 1920s research took place into [[Fluid catalytic cracking|cracking]], at the plant at [[Uphall]] in [[Scotland]] ([[West Lothian]]). The first new building opened in July 1931. 76 staff were there in 1929, 99 in 1934 and 197 in 1939. 

By the 1950s, BP Research was in a 39-acre site in Sunbury.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Yl2uvI_5Dt0C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27 New Scientist November 1957]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Geophysics|Geophysical]] research had also taken place at [[Kirklington Hall Research Station]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], until 1957. Around 1958, the site was expanded with a new Physics laboratory and five other buildings. A [[linear particle accelerator|Linear electron accelerator]] was installed. By early 1958, Kirklington Hall had been sold.

Products that the [[British Petroleum Company]] made in the 1950s were BP Motor Spirit and BP [[Energol]] (''visco-static'' [[motor oil]]). But Britain would not produce much oil of its own until the mid-1970s when [[North Sea oil]] arrived at the [[Forties Oil Field]]. 

===Construction===
Three new buildings were built from 1998 as part of Phase 1. Since 2001, four new buildings were built as part of Phase 2.

==Structure==
It is situated off the [[A244 road|A244]] (via the [[A308 road|A308]]) in the north of [[Sunbury-on-Thames]], and Surrey, on the Surrey boundary with London. To the east nearby is Sunbury Common.

The retail division of BP UK is at [[Witan Gate House]]. BP employs around 15,000 people in the UK.

It has an [[enhanced oil recovery]] [[laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/bp-magazine/bp-magazine-2014-issue-2.pdf BP Magazine 2014 Issue 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emile Durkheim, Division du travail social maitrier.jpg|thumb|Cover of the French edition of ''The Division of Labour in Society'']]

'''''The Division of Labour in Society''''' ({{lang-fr|De la division du travail social}}) is the doctoral dissertation of the French sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], published in 1893. It was influential in advancing [[sociology|sociological]] theories and thought, with ideas which in turn were influenced by [[Auguste Comte]].  Durkheim described how [[social order]] was maintained in societies based on two very different forms of [[solidarity]] – [[mechanical and organic solidarity|mechanical and organic]] – and the transition from more "primitive" societies to advanced [[industrial society|industrial societies]].

Durkheim suggested that in a "primitive" society, ''mechanical solidarity'', with people acting and thinking alike and with a shared [[Collective consciousness|collective conscience]], is what allows social order to be maintained. In such a society, Durkheim viewed [[crime]] as an act that "offends strong and defined states of the collective conscience" though he viewed crime as a normal social fact.&lt;ref&gt;Durkheim, Emile. ''The Division of Labour in Society.'' Trans. W. D. Halls, intro. [[Lewis A. Coser]]. New York: Free Press, 1997, pp. 39, 60, 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Because social ties are relatively homogeneous and weak throughout a mechanical society, the law has to be repressive and [[penal]] to respond to offences of the common conscience.

In an advanced, industrial, [[capitalism|capitalist]] society, the complex system of [[division of labour]] means that people are allocated in society according to merit and rewarded accordingly: social inequality reflects natural inequality, assuming that there is complete equity in the society. Durkheim argued that [[morality|moral]] regulation was needed, as well as [[economic regulation]], to maintain [[social order|order]] (or ''organic solidarity'') in society with people able to "compose their differences peaceably".&lt;ref&gt;Rock, Paul (2002). "Sociological Theories of Crime" in Maguire, Mike, Rod Morgan, and Robert Reiner, ''The Oxford Handbook of Criminology''. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this type of society, law would be more restitutive than penal, seeking to restore rather than punish excessively.

He thought that transition of a society from "primitive" to advanced may bring about major [[Civil disorder|disorder]], [[crisis]], and [[anomie]]. However, once society has reached the "advanced" stage, it becomes much stronger and is done developing. Unlike [[Karl Marx]], Durkheim did not foresee any different society arising out of the industrial capitalist division of labour. He regarded conflict, chaos, and disorder as pathological phenomena to modern society, whereas Marx highlights [[class conflict]].

'''The Fairground Park Riot''' was a [[Ethnic conflict|race riot]] that broke out on June 21, 1949 at a newly integrated public swimming pool.&lt;ref name="Silva"&gt;Eddie Silva, "The Longest Day," Riverfront Times,  October 25, 2016, http://www.riverfronttimes.com/stlouis/the-longest-day/Content?oid=2469321&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Swimmers at Fairgrounds Park swimming pool.jpg|thumb|Swimmers at Fairground Park swimming pool, 1920s]]
The Fairground Pool, in St. Louis [[Missouri]], was one of the largest pools in the [[American Midwest]] measuring 440 feet. The pool was able to hold from 10,000 to 12,000 swimmers at a time.&lt;ref&gt;"June 21, 1949-Race Riot Over Pool Integration in St. Louis Missouri,"legallegacy.worldpress.com, last modified June 21, 2016, https://legallegacy.wordpress.com/2016/06/21/june-21-1949-race-riot-over-pool-integration-in-st-louis-missouri/&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period much of the country was suffering from segregation. Missouri was among one of the states that was still segregated. Pickets had been put up at the Fairground Park to protest the segregation of pools. At the time; however, the federal law did not support segregation of public facilities.&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; O'Toole, who at the time made the decision regarding the pools and parks, realized that the pools could not continue to be segregated. He said, "I can't oppose anyone from lawfully using a swimming pool. They are taxpayers and citizens, too."&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; On June 21, 1949, African Americans were allowed access to the city pool for the first time. Until that day, the Fairground Park swimming pool was only open to white patrons. On the first day that it was open to African Americans too, only 30 to 40 African Americans showed up. They swam alongside white children without any problem until a group of white teenagers surrounded the fence that enclosed the pool and began to shout threats to the African American swimmers. The black children had to be taken to a changing room until they could be escorted out by police. Some eye witness reports contradict each other some saying that the children were not placed in harm's way, while others say that the police escorts did not stop the white teenagers from physically attacking the black children. Some witnesses reported that by 6:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. that day the crowd escalated to several hundred and of those people only 20 to 30 were African American. The riot escalated rapidly when a rumor got around that a black man had killed a white man. The black boys were surrounded by the white boys who had arrived with baseball bats. It appeared that one of the boys even had a knife. One of the African American children was beat until an officer fell on top of him to stop the white child from attacking him.  By now, the crowd had turned into thousands. Approximately 150 police officers were at the scene. By 10 o'clock that night, the situation mellowed down; however, the crowd did not fully disappear until after midnight. To avoid another eruption, the mayor decided that the best decision would be to segregate the pools again.&lt;ref name=Phillip&gt;Phillip O'Connor, "Pool riot pivotal in race relations City's decision in '49 to integrate swimming pools sparked violence that triggered change." St. Louis Post-Dispatch, June 21, 2009, http://www.stltoday.com/news/pool-riot-pivotal-in-race-relations-city-s-decision-in/article_914ec52e-4be8-5b09-ac98-e71da7160cc6.html&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, in 1950, it was ordered by the federal court to integrate the pools of St. Louis.

== Through Robert Gammon &amp; J.C. Tobias Eyes ==
When the race riot occurred, Robert Gammon was only a teenager. All he wanted to do wash cool down at the Fairground Park swimming pool. Sixty years later, he can still remember the fear he endured. He remembers the taunts, the bricks, and the fights. When he heard the radio announcement that the pool would be open for blacks as well, he did not think it would cause such backlash. For the longest time, all he wanted to do was swim in the outdoor pool that had the wooden diving platform. However, he had never experienced such fear as he did when he headed home that night. When he along with the other black kids were escorted to the changing room, he remembers a white woman spitting at him. Once the police escorts separated, Gammon and his friends were chased by whites to St. Louis Avenue before giving up. He even recalls one of his friends getting hit in the head by a brick that was thrown at him. After the riot, he felt that it would be a long time before he could trust white people again. He said, "I thought all white people hated us."&lt;ref name="Phillip" /&gt; To this day Gammon cannot understand why the riot happened. He wonders, "Just because I'm black?" He remembers the crowds continuing to get larger and larger as the day went on and more fights kept breaking out. Time magazine published an article about the riot in the days following the riot and described the scene as, "Negro boys were chased and beaten by white gangs. In the gathering dusk, one grown-up rabble-rouser spoke out. 'Want to know how to take care of those niggers?' he shouted. 'Get bricks. Smash their heads, the dirty, filthy "-".'" &lt;ref name="Phillip" /&gt; Years later Gammon visited the Fairground Park and leaned against the fence that once had enclosed the original pool. As the years have gone by, he does not see race the same way. He does not continue to hold the belief that all whites hate him; however, he does wish that the whole incident would have never happened. In his eyes, he sees things are better nowadays, but the issue is still prevalent and there is still progress to be made.  J.C. Tobias recalls being chased by a mob of white teenagers when he and some friends were walking back home from the park's baseball diamond. He said, "When you're a kids, you don't think much about it. As you age, you realize it didn't make much sense. We were just up there to swim."&lt;ref name="Phillip" /&gt; J.C. Tobias was just a teenager when the riot occurred and sixty years later he still has a vivid recollection of the event.

== The Other Side ==
Star-Times' also made a report about the riot. The report included what one middle-aged man at the riot said. According to the report, the man said, "Kill a nigger and make a name for yourself," the other man said.&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; "Kill the black bastards." &lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; Star Times' even included a photograph of white mothers carrying their young children along with them to miss the excitement. White teenagers went around with their weapons. They carried with them baseball bats and broom sticks. One reporter stated that they overheard one of the white teenagers say, "This is a waiting party. Waiting until it gets dark," and another white teenager replied with, "I'll kill the bastards."&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; Someone from the crowd spotted some African Americans and shouted, "There's some niggers!"&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; Like a swarm of ants, the proceeded towards the African American boys and surrounded them. They saw an African American boy pull a knife and they began to attack him. They used their clubs, bats, sticks, and their fist to attack the young boy. Despite police effort to protect the boy, the whites continued to attack him as he laid on the ground.

== Forgotten history ==
In Eddie Silva's, "The Longest Day,"&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; he shares his feeling about the race riot and believes that the race riot "has been erased from the city's collective memory."&lt;ref name="Silva" /&gt; This part of history is overlooked and not talked about because it forces the people to confront the city's racial divisions. Silva believes that ignoring the riot does not change that fact that it happened and it is something that needs receive the attention it deserves because its effects still continue currently. Some choose to forget or not believe that on the night of the riot approximately 4,000 to 5,000 whites roamed the grounds of the Fairground Park and assaulted any and every African American that crossed their path.&lt;ref name="Silva"/&gt;

== Aftermath ==
After the nearly twelve hours and 400 officers it took to restore order, there were over a dozen people injured and at least eight were arrested.&lt;ref name="Phillip" /&gt; No deaths resulted in the melee, however, ten black people and two white people were hospitalized for injuries sustained in the event. Official reports state that out of the seven people that were arrested that day, three were white and four were black. Of those seven however, three blacks and one white was ultimately arrested and charged with initiating the riot.&lt;ref&gt;Landon Jones, "Echoes of Michael Brown's Death in St. Louis's Racially Charged Past," The Atlantic, August 12, 2014,  https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/08/how-an-integrated-swimming-pool-incited-race-riots-in-st-louis/375943/&lt;/ref&gt; Attendance at the Fairground Park Pool dropped so significantly that it no longer made a profit and ultimately was closed down.

The '''Antonio Narro Agrarian Autonomous University''' or Universidad Autónoma Agraria Antonio Narro in Spanish ('''UAAAN''') is a public [[university]] in [[Mexico]] dedicated to the Agricultural, Silvicultural, Animal Production, food and Environmental Sciences. It is located 6 kilometers south of [[Saltillo]], in the Mexican state of [[Coahuila]]. The Antonio Narro Agrarian Autonomous University is one of the most important agricultural college of America Latina and the "Narro" have national and international recognition in the agricultural and animal industry and the high academic level. There is also a campus in [[Torreón]], Coahuila. It is also called "Universidad Antonio Narro" for short, or simply, "La Narro". In 2008 the UAAAN has an enrollment of about 4,500 students in both campuses, all in agriculture and related sciences. 

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:narromainoffice.jpg|thumb|left|The old main building of the Universidad Autónoma Agraria Antonio Narro (originally the main home of Don Antonio Narro; the building also has served as a student dormitory and office of the University President/Rector.]] --&gt;

== History ==

The Antonio Narro Agrarian Autonomous University (UAAAN) was founded on March 4, 1923, after the philanthropist Antonio Narro Rodríguez donated his Buenavista Estate for a public agricultural university, which became the "Regional School of Agriculture Antonio Narro".  The main objective of this university consisted on preparing young people in a professional discipline of agricultural work in the field.  Two months before dying on September 24, 1912, Antonio Narro Rodriguez had bequeathed a substantial part of its personal fortune: his property in Buenavista and $22,000 [[Mexican peso]]s, the value of six urban properties in the city of [[Saltillo]], for constituting a school of agriculture.

Over the years, the university college changed its name several times. In 1938, it became the ''Superior School of Agriculture'' (''Escuela Superior de Agricultura''); by 1957, then became a founding institution of the ''[[Universidad Autónoma de Coahuila|University of Coahuila]]''. In 1975, it became ''Antonio Narro Agrarian Autonomous University'' by a decree of the Coahuila state congress.  Finally, in 2006, UAAAN was recognized as a Federal University, through a decree approved by the House of Representatives, the Senators Chamber and published in the federal registry by the President of Mexico, April 26, 2006.

In the 1990s, the university built and signed on a radio station, [[XESAL-AM]] 1220.

== Shield ==
The emblem that carries the Universidad Autónoma Agraria Antonio Narro expresses the ancestral eagle of Mexico, holding in its talons the spike of wheat as a symbol of life and bread. It holds the wisdom (represented by the owl) surrounded by clouds (rain) that  germinate the seed. Wisdom stands on the plough and the land. Mind and force together for a single purpose: the love of mother earth (Alma Terra Mater), for the life of man.

== Mascot ==

In the same year he was born the team mascot is looking for the same, one day, after an intense practice, team members began to eat with great appetite, which made someone cry "... They eat like vultures ... ". Students found in this bird similar to the colors "black and gold" (some vultures are black, some are white-yellowish neck) also has claw vulture, which was characteristic of the founding team, and lives in the mountains while the school is located in the foothills of the majestic Sierra de "Zapalinamé" and guarded by a jealous guardian: "EI Old Picacho," San Lorenzo Canyon. Thus was born "the Vultures" so much tradition.

== Physical setting ==

Climate at the main (Saltillo) campus of the UAAAN is dry semicalid; there are occasional freezes. Temperature seldom  drops below -2 °C (26 F) (once in some years).  Annual rainfall is about 300 mm.

== Facilities ==
The main ([[Saltillo]]) campus of the UAAAN occupies more than 4 square kilometres in a fertile valley a few kilometres south of the city of Saltillo on the [[Zacatecas]] highway. A substantial amount of this land is occupied by experimental and demonstrative plots including annual and perennial crops like: corn, wheat, triticale; vegetables such as temperate (Cruciferae: [[broccoli]], [[cabbage]]), warm-season (Solanaceae: [[Capsicum|peppers]], tomatoes), and others ([[Squash (fruit)|squash]], [[cilantro]], [[onion]]s, [[garlic]], etc.); [[pecan]] and [[pistachio]] orchards; [[greenhouses]] (growing [[vegetables]] and [[ornamentals]]). All agriculture must use [[irrigation]]; there is no [[dryland]] agriculture.  The University also includes animal production facilities (barns for intensive rearing of pigs, cows, goats, and dairy cows, mainly) including [[fistulated cattle]].  There is also has a cattle ranch (Rancho Los Angeles) (extensively colonized by the endangered Mexican prairie dogs, ''[[Cynomys mexicanus]]''); a [[reforestation]] woodland occupying more than 4 km² of [[pine]]s; and a [[botanical garden]] featuring mainly desert plant species ([[cacti]], [[agave]]s) and trees. 

The UAAAN has several agricultural experimental fields across Mexico, encompassing climates from the wet tropics ([[Veracruz]]) to the [[Chihuahuan desert]]: Ocampo, Coahuila state; [[Matehuala]], [[San Luis Potosi]] state (cactus botanical garden); Noria de Guadalupe, [[Zacatecas]] state; [[Cuencamé, Durango|Cuencamé]], [[Durango]] state.

'''Visual geography''' is the study of [[geography]] as represented in paintings, photos and other forms of the [[visual arts]]. Both [[human geography]] and [[physical geography]] in the visual arts are studied. Typical studies in Visual Geography include the [[geographical]] symbols within visual arts. Another is cross referencing the date a piece of visual art was produced with known weather records to see if the art was drawn accurately in the field or from memory in a studio.
