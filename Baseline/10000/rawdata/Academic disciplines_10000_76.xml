      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3221">An '''active surface''' is a surface of a [[radio telescope]] that is under active computer control of its shape.

Large (more than  10&amp;nbsp;m in diameter or length) radio telescopes always bend during operation, due to their enormous weight and the fact that even the strongest materials are not perfectly stiff.  This bending, in the range of a few millimetres, does not affect low frequency operation much, but dramatically reduces the efficiency of the telescope at higher frequencies where the wavelengths are comparable to the distortion.  Typically, the efficiency of a telescope drops appreciably when the deviation from the desired shape is more than 1/10 of the considered wavelength.  An active surface uses numerous small actuators to move the surface panels with respect to the underlying frame, and thus maintain the correct shape.

An active surface can try to compensate for many different types of errors.  The first is gravity&amp;mdash;this is simplest since previous measurements, or even a mathematical model, can be used to predict (and correct) any bending.  More difficult is correction for wind and thermal errors, since these require measuring and correcting in real time.

Some examples of active surfaces are:
*[[Green Bank Telescope]]
*[[Large Millimeter Telescope]]
*[[Sardinia Radio Telescope]]
*[[Noto Radio Observatory]]

The Chinese [[Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope]] uses a uniquely ambitious form of active surface, not only correcting errors, but applying deflections of up to {{convert|47|cm}} in order to aim and focus the telescope.

'''Animal studies''' is a recently recognized field in which animals are studied in a variety of cross-disciplinary ways. Scholars who engage in animal studies may be formally trained in a number of diverse fields, including [[geography]], [[art history]], [[anthropology]], [[biology]], [[film studies]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[psychology]], [[literary studies]], [[museology]], [[philosophy]], communication, and [[sociology]]. They may engage with questions about literal animals, or about notions of "animality" or "brutality," employing various theoretical perspectives, including [[feminism]], [[Marxist theory]], and [[queer theory]]. Using these perspectives, those who engage in animal studies seek to understand both human-animal relations now and in the past, and to understand animals as beings-in-themselves, separate from our knowledge of them. Because the field is still developing, scholars and others have some freedom to define their own criteria about what issues may structure the field.

==History==
As an interdisciplinary subject, animal studies exists at the intersection of a number of different fields of study. Different fields began to turn to animals as an important topic at different times and for various reasons, and these separate disciplinary histories shape how scholars approach animal studies.

In part, animal studies developed out of the [[animal liberation movement]] and was grounded in [[ethics|ethical]] questions about co-existence with other species: whether it is moral to eat animals, to do scientific research on animals for human benefit, and so on. Animal studies scholars who explore the field from an ethical perspective frequently cite [[Australian]] philosopher [[Peter Singer]]'s 1975 work, ''[[Animal Liberation (book)|Animal Liberation]]'',&lt;ref name="Gorman"&gt;{{cite web |author=Gorman, James |date=12 January 2012 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/science/animal-studies-move-from-the-lab-to-the-lecture-hall.html?pagewanted=all |title=Animal Studies Move From the Lab to the Lecture Hall |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a founding document in animal studies.  Singer's work followed [[Jeremy Bentham#Animal rights|Jeremy Bentham]]'s by trying to expand [[utilitarian]] questions about pleasure and pain beyond humans to other [[sentience|sentient]] creatures.

Theorists interested in the role of animals in literature, culture, and [[Continental philosophy]] also consider the late work of [[Jacques Derrida]] a driving force behind the rise of interest in animal studies in the humanities.&lt;ref name="Gorman" /&gt;  Derrida's final lecture series, ''The Animal That Therefore I Am'', examined how interactions with animal life affect human attempts to define humanity and the self through language. Taking up Derrida's deconstruction and extending it to other cultural territory, [[Cary Wolfe]] published ''Animal Rites'' in 2003 and critiqued earlier animal rights philosophers such as [[Peter Singer]] and Thomas Regan. Wolfe's study points out an insidious humanism at play in their philosophies and others. Recently also the Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]] published a book on the question of the animal: ''The Open. Man and Animal''.

==Research topics and methodologies==
Researchers in animal studies examine the questions and issues that arise when traditional modes of [[Humanities|humanistic]] and [[Science|scientific]] inquiry begin to take animals seriously as subjects of thought and activity.  Students of animal studies may examine how humanity is defined in relation to animals, or how representations of animals create understandings (and misunderstandings) of other species. In order to do so, animal studies pays close attention to the ways that humans [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] animals, and asks how humans might avoid bias in observing other creatures. For instance, [[Donna Haraway]]'s book, ''Primate Visions'', examines how [[diorama]]s created for the [[American Museum of Natural History]] showed family groupings that conformed to the traditional human [[nuclear family]], which misrepresented the animals' observed behavior in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Donna |last=Haraway |authorlink=Donna_Haraway |jstor=466593 |title=Teddy Bear Patriarchy: Taxidermy in the Garden of Eden, New York City, 1908–1936 |journal=Social Text |issue=11 |date=Winter 1984–1985 |pages=20–64 |publisher=Duke University Press |doi = 10.2307/466593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical approaches in animal studies have also considered representations of non-human animals in popular culture, including species diversity in animated films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans |first=Timothy |last=Laurie |journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human |year=2015 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912960}}, eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.&lt;/ref&gt;

By highlighting these issues, animal studies strives to re-examine traditional [[Ethics|ethical]], [[Politics|political]], and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] categories in the context of a renewed attention to and respect for animal life. The assumption that focusing on animals might clarify human knowledge is neatly expressed in [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]]'s famous dictum that animals are "good to think."&lt;ref&gt;Lévi-Strauss, Claude. ''Totemism''. Boston: Beacon Press, 1963, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''aphotic zone''' (aphotic from [[Greek language|Greek]] prefix {{lang|grc|ἀ-}} + {{lang|grc|φῶς}} "without light") is the portion of a lake or ocean where there is little or no sunlight. It is formally defined as the depths beyond which less than 1% of sunlight penetrates. Consequently, [[bioluminescence]] is essentially the only light found in this zone. Most food in this zone comes from [[Marine snow|dead organisms sinking]] to the bottom of the lake or ocean from overlying waters.

The depth of the aphotic zone can be greatly affected by such things as [[turbidity]] and the season of the year. The aphotic zone underlies the [[photic zone]], which is that portion of a lake or ocean directly affected by sunlight.

==The ocean==
Depending on how aphotic zone is defined, the aphotic zone of the ocean begins between depths of roughly {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and extends to the ocean floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author1=Earle, Sylvia A. |author2=Thorne-Miller, Boyce | title=The living ocean: understanding and protecting marine biodiversity | year=1999 | publisher=Island Press | location=Washington, D.C. | isbn=1-55963-678-5 | pages=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Kunich | first=John C. | title=Killing our oceans: dealing with the mass extinction of marine life | year=2006 | publisher=Praeger Publishers | location=Westport, CT | isbn=978-0-275-98878-4 | pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Williams | first=Linda Meyer | title=Earth science demystified | year=2004 | publisher=McGraw-Hill | location=London | isbn=0-07-143499-2 | pages=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temperatures can range from roughly {{convert|0|C|0}} to {{convert|6|C|0}}.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Unusual and unique creatures dwell in this expanse of pitch black water, such as the [[Saccopharyngiformes|gulper eel]], the [[giant squid]], the [[anglerfish]], and the [[vampire squid]].

The '''architecture of Uzbekistan''' is considered as the symbol of the nations' history. In spite of changing economic conditions, technological advances, demographic fluctuations and cultural shifts, the originality of [[Uzbek architecture]] can be seen in the country. 
[[Samarkand]], [[Bukhara]], [[Khiva]], [[Shakhrisabz]], [[Termez]] and [[Kokand]] are the most famous architectural centers of art and science. Particularly, palaces, mausoleums and mosques, minarets and ancient masterpieces are survived to capture the pages of history.
By confirming analytical facts from archeological researches about inhabiting the territory of [[Central Asia]], it is stated that trends in architecture are seen parallel to [[Acheulean era]]. In fact, several pieces of monuments belong to both stone and bronze ages have been found in the mountains of [[Surxondaryo Region|Surkhandarya]], [[Tashkent]], [[Samarkand]], [[Fergana]] and [[Navoi]] regions and in rivers’ valleys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijstr.org/final-print/mar2015/The-Ways-Of-The-Development-Of-Architecture-Of-Independent-Uzbekistan.pdf Research paper] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
During the Middle Ages, Uzbekistan was the center of the 7000-mile-long Silk Road, which enabled the flourish of architectural designs of Uzbek culture. Besides, Timurid-period architecture from 14th to 16th century, Shaybanid era of the 16th century resulted in the contribution of Islamic architecture and as well as Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countriesquest.com/asia/uzbekistan/culture/art_and_architecture.htm Middle ages] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
Till the 20th century, Uzbek architecture has been characterized by its connection with traditional background on the one hand, and modern innovation on the other.

== History ==
Splendid, colorful mosaics, religious symbols, and abstract geometrical patterns have always characterized historical construction in Uzbekistan. At first sight, the design seems beautiful itself while deeper look maintains geometrical and scientific intellect of abstractness.

== Pre-historic times==
The earliest traces of human habitation in the area of [[Uzbekistan]] are dated back many centuries. Turning details, information about ancient settlements proves that the earliest art of construction is [[Sapallitepa]] (17th-14th centuries BC) and [[Jarkutan]] (14th-9th centuries BC), as well as [[Buddhist monuments]], particularly [[Fayaztepa]] and [[Karatepa]], can be found in [[Surhandarya]] region (1st-3rd centuries AD). They all capture the stages of [[Central Asian]] civilization. One of the most important factor about Uzbek national history is the significance of the culture of ancient Khorezm. According to the life of [[Abu Rayhan Beruny]], it can be notified that the city established even 982 years before [[Alexander the Great]] invaded [[Central Asia]], or, in other words, 34 centuries ago. In other words, settlements of ancient [[Khorezm]] antiquityis defined by architectural masterpieces, such as [[Janbaskala]] (4th century BCE), [[Koi Krilgankala]] (2nd century BC – 4th century AD), [[Toprakkala]] (1st century BC – 6th century AD), Ayazkala (2nd century BC, on the territory of Republic of Karakalpakstan).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijstr.org/final-print/mar2015/The-Ways-Of-The-Development-Of-Architecture-Of-Independent-Uzbekistan.pdf Research paper] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medieval eras ==
[[Bukhara]], [[Samarkand]] and [[Khiva]] play a vital role in the influence of [[Middle Age]] architecture of [[Uzbekistan]]. For instance, palaces of the rulers, places of residence of aristocracy, market places, madrasah and mausoleums are confirmed as exceptional architectural patterns.

=== The Kyrk-Kyz ===
[[The Kyrk-Kyz]] ('Forty Girls') mansion in Termez dating back the 9th- 10th centuries is a fine example of an original country manor. [[The Samanids Mausoleum]] in [[Bukhara]] still stands as a fine architectural building from the marvelous period of early [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uzbektravel.com/eng/architecture1.htm Article] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Registan ===
[[File:Registan square Samarkand.jpg|thumb|''[[Registan]]'']]
In the 11th-12th centuries, Samarkand became one of the major cities in the region.  As ''The nobles public square in the world''  (Lord Curzon) – [[Registan]] is the main artwork and the heart of the ancient city Samarkand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lxmagazines.com/2008/12/the-art-architecture-of-uzbekistan/ Sher-Dar Madrasah] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Being framed by three madrasahs (Islamic schools) of distinctive Islamic architecture: the [[Ulugh Beg Madrasah]] (1417–1420), the [[Tilla-Kari Madrasah]] (1646–1660) and the [[Sher-Dar Madrasah]] (1619–1636), it was a public square.

The Ulugh Beg Madrasah, was built in the times of Timurid Empire era of Timur, known as [[Tamerlane]]. By looking architectural point of view, it has a lancet-arch (pishtaq) or main square entrance. High minarets represent the beauty of the corners. There is a mosaic panel over the entrance arch, which was decorated by geometrical stylized ornaments. The building consists of mosque and lecture rooms, specialized for students. The walls have magnificent art galleries along the axes.

The construction of the Sher-Dar and Tilla-Kari madrasahs was ordered to be built in the 17th century. The tiger mosaics appear on the face of each madrasah.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamic-arts.org/2014/the-registan-square/ About Registan] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lion(or tiger) on the Sher-dor madrassa.JPG|thumb|left|The image of a lion on the ''[[Sher-dar Madrasah]]'']]
Specifically, the uniqueness of Sher Dar madrasah is found as images of lion-tigers, deer, and human faces. They are not only just paintings, but also special symbols of power by the perceptions of Islam religion. The real design beauty and association between grand portal, decorated pillars, and other masterpieces are impossible to be captured in photos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lxmagazines.com/2008/12/the-art-architecture-of-uzbekistan/ Sher-Dar Madrasah] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Tilla-Kari madrasah]] ( means «gold-covered») was known as the last, while huge and the most glorious structure of the Registan Square. Tilla-Kari madrasah includes 120 meter-long façade, relieving the square’s oppressive symmetrical axis. The composition of minaret at the corner gives strength to the architecture of the madrasah. Exterior scene was enriched by polychromatic tiles with geometric patterns. Moreover, at the center, there is tall pishtaq enables each façade to be more glorious.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islamic-arts.org/2014/the-registan-square/ About Registan] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture of Temur's period captures the 13th century. In particular, strong castles, the symbols of strong government, authority and victory of the Islamic civilization, marketplaces - symbols of the role of trade, and living quarters - the essence of the complex urban life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uzbektravel.com/eng/architecture1.htm Article] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bibi Khanum Mosque ===
[[File:SamarkandBibiKhanym.jpg|thumb|Bibi Khanym Mosque]]
For example, the greatest monumental architecture was the [[Bibi Khanum Mosque]], which has 115 feet high portals, 165-foot minarets, 400 cupolas and a huge courtyard. Specific features about the mosque is the gates, made of seven metals, and the building itself marble and terracotta with a decoration of mosaics and blue-gold frescoes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uzbektravel.com/eng/architecture1.htm Article] web page] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of the Timurid dynasty (14th -16th centuries), as well as the Shaybanid era (16th century) is famous for its colorful architectural designs, such as Turquoise-colored domes: the dome of the Gur-e Amir (Tamerlane's mausoleum in Samarqand).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countriesquest.com/asia/uzbekistan/culture/art_and_architecture.htm Middle ages] web page] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== 19th century ==
At the end of the 19th and the beginning of 20th centuries constructions give e scene of typical residential architecture of an ordinary Uzbek citizens. While the buildings reflect the experiences of historical background and as well as local and modern conditions of the region. For instance, an inhabited house in Bukhara has a closed character and is isolated from the street noise and dust. Its isolated rooms were built according to the weather changes and create a unique microclimate in both the heat and cold. Further example is Khiva, with a high terrace opened to the wind promotes the creation of a favorable microclimate in houses. So, in [[Ferghana]], for example, houses had sliding walls and shutters, and were decorated with niches, ganch (wooden architecture), and other characteristic conditions. Besides, having very simple design styles, the national are veryrational and supplies the originality of Uzbek culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uzbektravel.com/eng/architecture1.htm Article] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conclusion ==
It has been proved by the facts that special features of Uzbek architecture harmonize traditional originality of structure formation and consideration of microclimate. The magnificent cities of [[Tashkent]], Samarkand, Bukhara, [[Khiva]] are famous with such fantastic architectural ensembles as Khazrat Imam, Registan, Lyabi Khaus, Ichan Kala etc. Almost all historical cities of Central Asia are considered to be on the «Must seen places».&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ijstr.org/final-print/mar2015/The-Ways-Of-The-Development-Of-Architecture-Of-Independent-Uzbekistan.pdf Research paper] checked 29 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BeltPress.svg|right|thumb|400px|Diagram of a belt filter: sludge in the '''feed hopper''' is sandwiched between two filter cloths (shown green and purple). Fluid is extracted initially by gravity, then by squeezing the cloth through rollers. '''Filtrate''' exits through a drain, while solids are scraped off into a container.]]
The '''belt filter''' (sometimes called a '''belt press filter''', or '''belt filter press''') is an industrial [[machine]], used for solid/liquid separation processes, particularly the [[dewatering]] of [[sludge]]s in the [[chemical industry]], [[mining]] and [[water treatment]]. Belt filter presses are also used in the production of [[Apple cider#Commercial production|apple juice, cider]] and winemaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.core-equip.com/catalogue/category/1465|title=Core belt filter presses designed for the apple juice, cider and winemaking industries.|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of [[filtration]] is primarily obtained by passing a pair of [[Filter (chemistry)|filtering]] cloths and belts through a system of rollers.  The system takes a [[sludge]] or [[slurry]] as a feed, and separates it into a [[filtrate]] and a solid cake.

==Applications==
The belt filter is mainly used for dewatering&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; of sludge and slurry and juice extraction from apples, pears and other fruits, as well as grapes for winemaking, etc. Belt filters are used both municipally and industrially in a range of areas including urban [[sewage treatment|sewage]] and [[industrial wastewater treatment|wastewater treatment]], metallurgy and mining, steel plants, coal plants, breweries, dyeing, tanneries, as well as chemical and paper factories.&lt;ref name=ChinaBS&gt;http://www.china-blackstone.com, Zhengzhou Black Stone Machinery Co. LTD., 2012, 1 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The applications of a belt filter are only limited to the sludges, slurry or mashed fruit that it can process. The sludges from municipal use include raw, anaerobically digested and aerobically digested sludges, alum sludge, lime softening sludge and river water silt.&lt;ref name=KSwebsite&gt;http://www.beltfilterpress.com, Komline-Sanderson, 2013,  "Belt Filter Press", Komline-Sanderson Engineering Corporation, Peapack, USA, viewed 2 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In industry, any sludge or slurry is sourced from food processing wastes, pulp and paper wastes, chemical sludges, pharmaceutical wastes, industrial waste processing sludges, and petrochemical wastes.&lt;ref name=KSwebsite /&gt; These wastes can include mixed sludge, mineral slurry, dust sediment, selected coal washing mud, biological sludge, primary sludge, and straw, wood or waste paper pulp.&lt;ref name=ChinaBS /&gt;

Some dewatering objectives include reducing the volume to reduce the transport and storage costs, removing liquids before landfill disposal, reducing fuel requirements before further drying or incineration, producing adequate material for composting, avoiding runoff and pooling when used for land applications, and optimizing other drying processes.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; Belt filters are specifically designed for each of these particular applications and feeds.

==Advantages/limitations==
There are many physical separation processes similar to the belt filter press used for dewatering, including [[centrifuge]]s, vacuum-disc filters, and the plate and frame [[filter press]]. When compared to other compression filters, belt filters use relatively lower pressures.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; Although centrifuges have lower moisture content, lower costs and simpler operations in coal tails processing,&lt;ref name=Steel&gt;Mohanty, M.K. Wang, Z. Huang, Z., Hirschi, J., 2004, ''Optimization of the Dewatering Performance of a Steel Belt Filter'', Coal Preparation Journal, 24:53 68&lt;/ref&gt; belt filters tend to make less noise and have much quicker startup and shutdown times.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;

Belt filters are considered simple and reliable, with good availability, low staffing, easy maintenance and a long life.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=KSwebsite /&gt;&lt;ref name=SLFiltration /&gt; The belt filter is most advantageous when installed such that it is open and viewable at floor level for easier adjustment and monitoring. This is of course subject to what lighting and ventilation will allow.&lt;ref name=SLFiltration /&gt;

The belt filter press is often used in wastewater treatment, and thus the odour of the feed sludge, volatile emissions and the chemicals used in treatment, may become a problem.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; One control method is to use odour-neutralizing chemicals such as potassium permanganate.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; However this only neutralizes odours and doesn’t affect any gases or chemicals involved.  Although all problems can be controlled by enclosing the filter, the enclosure reduces essential visibility and easy access to the machine for maintenance and repairs, leading to the expensive automation of the process.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt;

A belt filter press is also known for its high capacity throughput,&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; as it is designed to handle excess capacity.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; It has low initial costs&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; and low energy running costs,&lt;ref name=KSwebsite /&gt; however, if throughput is less than 4 million gallons per day, the belt filter press may be less cost efficient than liquid transport, hiring a processing facility, or utilizing non-mechanical dewatering methods such as drying beds or reed beds.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;

Belt filters are less effective at processing some feeds. Unless the feed is well mixed from a [[Anaerobic digestion|digester]], the use of belt filters will be more costly when processing a feed with varying solids content as this requires more operator attention, raising staffing costs.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; Feeds with high grease and oil content can lower the solids percentage in the cake by blinding the belt filter&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; and all feeds need to be screened to protect the belt from being damaged by sharp objects. The type of feed may also affect the washing process. The belt filter needs to be washed frequently which consumes large amount of water and time.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; Water and time wastage, as well as the associated costs can be reduced by automating the washing system and using [[effluents]].&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;

==Designs available==
Belt filter designs are crafted using manufacturer design and performance data, operating installations, pilot testing, surveys of similar plants and testing of the wastewater solids&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; to obtain a desired dewatered solid percentage from the sludge or slurry to be processed.

Belt press filters have 4 main zones: preconditioning zone, gravity drainage zone, linear compression (low-pressure) zone and roller compression (high-pressure) zone.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; Preconditioned slurry, which is flocculated and/or coagulated depending on the feed and process, is thickened in the gravity drainage zone.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; The gravity drainage zone is a flat or inclined belt where gravity drainage of free water occurs&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; The gravity drainage area is sized according to feed solid concentrations. The standard size can be used for solids concentrations of 1.5 percent or greater, but a setup with a longer drainage area or extended size should be used for 1.5 to 2.5 percent feed solids for more free water drainage before compression. For dilute sludge with feed solids of less than 1.5 percent, an independent gravity drainage belt can be used. This belt is used only in the gravity drainage area, not in the pressure zones.&lt;ref name= KSIII&gt;http://www.beltfilterpress.com, Komline-Sanderson, "GRS Series III Kompress Belt Filter Press", Komline-Sanderson, 1 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure or wedge zones use two belts, upper and lower, to sandwich the feed together,&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; but an independent gravity zone has its own separate belt, making the belt filter a three-belt system. Depending on the required conditions of the cake, belt filters can have added washing stages and, infrared, hot gas or even microwave drying stages.&lt;ref name=SLFiltration&gt;Sparks, T.,''Solid-Liquid Filtration – A Users’ Guide to Minimizing Costs and Environmental Impact; Maximizing Quality and Productivity'', Elsevier, Portland, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Belt filters are very versatile and are made to suit the sludges, slurries or mashed fruit to be processed. For a feed or treatment process which produces unpleasant odours, [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] emissions, [[pathogens]] and hazardous gases like [[hydrogen sulphide]]&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;&lt;ref name=SLFiltration /&gt; the belt filter can include fume hoods or even be completely enclosed in a gas tight housing.&lt;ref name=SLFiltration /&gt;  Due to the reduced visibility and increased corrosion associated with enclosure, the belt filter process can also be automated.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; Large filtration areas, additional rollers and a variable belt speed can be found in advanced belt press filter designs.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt;

==Process characteristics==
Belt press filters are designed for solids capacity, by weight or volume, rather than wastewater flow. Solids concentration must be determined based on the concentration of primary solids in the feed and further solids that may precipitate during treatment. Solids concentration for a process will vary, thus the design must have the capacity to deal with varying feed solids concentration.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS&gt;''Biosolids Technology Fact Sheet: Belt Filter Press'', US Environmental Protection Agency, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The feed to a belt press filter depends on the type of solids, desired product and filter design. For most sludge types the feed dry solids concentration is typically in the range of 1-10%.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; The resulting dewatered sludge (or cake) dry solids concentration typically falls in the range of 12-50%.&lt;ref name=DesignIR&gt;''Design Information Report: Belt Filter Presses'', US Environmental Protection Agency, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; Dilute feed solids concentration results in a cake of higher moisture content whilst a higher feed solids concentration yields an improved solids filtration rate and drier end product.&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;R. Perry, D. Green, ''Perry’s Chemical Engineers’ Handbook'', 8th edition, McGraw-Hill, 2007, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

The input to a belt press filter is generally measured as the rate of dry [[solids loading]] (mass of dry solids per time per belt width). Again, the input solids loading is dependent on the sludge type and filter media, thus there is great variation in the dry solids loading rates of operating belt press filters. Typically, lower range solids loading rates fall in the range of 40–230&amp;nbsp;kg/h/m belt width and high range solids loading rates fall in the range of 300–910&amp;nbsp;kg/h/m belt width.&lt;ref name=DesignIR /&gt; Whilst loading is important for measuring production rate, it is also important to consider the thickness of the cake that forms in the gravity drainage section. Cake thickness affects the permeability of the filtration media and the filtration rate.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; Testing for the particular sludge type must be conducted to determine the optimum cake thickness. In some cases where filtrate recovery is important, it may be necessary to introduce a cake [[washing (process)|washing]] step.

The primary objective of a belt press filter is to dewater process sludge and much of this dewatering occurs in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone can achieve a 5 to 10 percent increase in solids concentration.&lt;ref name=BiosolidsFS /&gt; The degree of dewatering in the gravity drainage zone is greatly dependent on the type of solids, the filter media and the sludge conditioning. The dewatering achieved in the gravity drainage zone is adversely affected if the sludge is poorly spread across the belt or the residence time is insufficient.&lt;ref name=DesignIR /&gt; Sludge conditioning is the addition of chemicals to promote [[flocculation]] of particles to form a thickened sludge and to promote dewatering. Dewatering can be promoted by the addition of [[surfactant]] and flocculation is achieved via the addition of high molecular weight polymer. Flocculation is improved with optimum polymer dosage, polymer dilution and mixing. The [[pH]] of the feed slurry must also be monitored and controlled as low pH decreases flocculation.&lt;ref name=LabTechnique&gt;Richard A. Poduska P.E. Ph.D. &amp; B. H. Collins Jr., ''A simple laboratory technique for determining belt-filter press operation'', Environmental Technology Letters, 1980, 1:12, p. 547-556&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to find the optimum value for each conditioning parameter as too much polymer or mixing can have a negative impact on flocculation and greatly increase operating expenses.&lt;ref name=LabTechnique /&gt; The effects of sludge conditioning are most apparent in the gravity drainage zone which can be easily replicated on a laboratory scale where the optimum conditioning strategy can be determined.&lt;ref name=LabTechnique /&gt; For a belt press filter to be industrially viable it must be economically efficient and thus maximum throughput is desired. Without sufficient conditioning, the gravity drainage is generally the limiting process step, but with optimum dilution the limiting process step can be shifted to the compression zone.&lt;ref name=LabTechnique /&gt;

In the compression zone of a belt press filter, the filter cake is compressed between the two belts and passed over rollers to exert pressure on the cake. There is an optimum number of rollers above which a drier product is not necessarily the result. Drier product is obtained from reduced belt speed rather than increased pressing time.&lt;ref name=MunicipalSD&gt;Oliver, J. and Vaxelaire, J., ''Municipal sludge dewatering by belt filter press: effect of operating parameters'', Journal of Chemical Technology and Biotecnology, 2005, 80, p. 948-953&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall performance of a belt press filter is improved where variations in parameters such as sludge type, feed solids concentration and conditioning are minimised.&lt;ref name=DesignIR /&gt;

The efficiency of a belt press filter is often assessed based on the dry solids content of the product cake, solids recovery and lateral migration of sludge on the belt.&lt;ref name=MunicipalSD /&gt; Solids recovery is the percentage of dry solids recovered from the feed sludge. Solids recovery is dependent on the filter media which must be selected for good permeability to promote dewatering but with pore diameter sufficiently small so that solids recovery is not greatly decreased. It is important that the belt press filter has an effective belt washing section so that [[blinding(filtration)|blinding]] does not decrease the permeability of the belt.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; Solids recovery is directly related to filtrate quality and thus the filter media and process arrangement must satisfy the desired cake and filtrate qualities. Dry solids content is a measure of the degree of dewatering. The degree of dewatering is increased when the belt speed is decreased.&lt;ref name=MunicipalSD /&gt; Lowering the belt speed reduces the capacity of the process. The following correlation relates input mass flow rate to belt speed:&lt;ref name=MunicipalSD /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;Q_0=m_0 s_b L_{sludge0} &lt;/math&gt;

Where Q&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = mass flow rate (kg/s), m&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = mass loading (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), s&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = belt speed (m/s) and L&lt;sub&gt;sludge0&lt;/sub&gt; = initial width of sludge across the belt (m). Thus to maintain industrial scale economic throughput at lower belt speed, the mass loading and width of sludge across the belt must be increased. It has been found that increasing the solids loading slightly decreases the dry solids concentration of the cake while significantly increasing the potential for sludge to overflow the belt.&lt;ref name=MunicipalSD /&gt; Lateral migration of sludge on the belt is a measure of how the sludge spreads across the width of the belt. Increased lateral sludge migration means that sludge is escaping the edge of the belt and overflowing into the filtrate. Therefore, increased lateral sludge migration negatively impacts filtrate quality and dry solids recovery.

Generally, the minimum design discharge cake thickness is 3–5&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; This ensures that the cake is thick enough to discharge and is easily removed from the belt.

==Heuristics of the design==
In order of increasing cost and decreasing product moisture the most common dewatering options are a [[Gravity separation|thickener]], [[deep bed thickeners|deep bed thickening]], belt presses and [[membrane filter presses]]. In general [[centrifuges]] and other competing technologies do not show a significant cost advantage compared to the belt press filter, for the same cake dryness. The cost of flocculant is often a major operating cost of dewatering equipment. Belt press filters in general have the lowest flocculant consumption for any of the listed processes excluding membrane filter presses and centrifuges.&lt;ref name=TailingsDT&gt;http://www.acarp.com.au/abstracts.aspx?repId=C14012, Bickert. G, "Tailings Dewatering Technologies for Australian Coal Processing Plants", Australians Coal Association Research Program, Report Number C14012 , 2004, viewed 2 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing the feed solid concentration increases the solid filtration rate, minimises cake moisture content and produces a more homogeneous cake all of which are desirable outcomes. If increasing the feed solid concentration is not practical the addition of flocculants in a pre-treatment step has a similar result. The optimum dosage level of flocculant can be found by monitoring the [[viscosity]] of the slurry.

[[Homogeneous]] cakes are desirable as if the feed slurry is too dilute the filter cake will contain higher moisture content as a result of stratification. The minimum feed concentration that results in a homogeneous cake is determined by observing a sample of the slurry. If rapid settling occurs the filter cake formed will not be homogeneous and the filtration rate is decreased.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt;

The minimum cake discharge thickness for horizontal belt press filters is in the region of 5&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt;

The choice of belt is critical to the function of the belt press filter and a wide variety of materials and weaves are available. The filter cloth for a belt press filter should be as open as possible while maintaining the desired filtrate clarity or, if precoat is used, to prevent the loss of precoat. Lighter cloths produce a clearer filtrate and do not block as rapidly however their durability and life span is significantly shorter than heavier cloths.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; Both seamless and seamed belts are available. Seamed belts wear faster at the seam and cause wear at the rollers and the doctor blade. Zipper-type and clipper-type seamed belts are also available with the zipper-type having a longer life span as they provide less discontinuity. Seamless belts have the longest life span but are more expensive. Also it should be ensured that the belt press is compatible with a seamless belt.&lt;ref name=DesignIR /&gt;

Increasing the temperature of the feed slurry decreases the viscosity of the liquid phase. This is beneficial as it increases the filtration rate and decreases the cake moisture. The same advantages can be obtained by other drying methods such as passing dry steam through the deliquored cake to raise the temperature of the remaining moisture, or other [[drying]] methods can be utilised.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt;

Cake thickness may have to be controlled or restricted when cake washing is required or the final cake moisture is a critical parameter. When cake washing time is a dominating factor the maximum filtration rate will occur when the minimum cake thickness for discharge is achieved. The time required for washing is increased by the square of the ratio of cake thicknesses. For example, if the thickness of the cake is doubled the washing time will increase roughly by a factor of 4.

==Necessary post-treatment systems==
Completely clear filtrate cannot be obtained using belt press filters except in rare circumstances. Thus further treatment may be required for the filtrate before it is reused or discharged as waste. If the filter is downstream of a [[clarifier]] or thickener the filtrate (and wash water) can be recycled back into the clarifier to reduce the required filtrate clarity and allows for the use of more durable cloths. If recycling or reuse is not an option the filtrate should be discharged subject to legislation and license requirements. Further treatment of clarified water (filtration or chemical treatment) may be required before discharge.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt;

The filter cake usually has a high enough solid concentration to allow for all types of disposal methods without further treatment including recycling back into the process, landfill/composting and incineration. The polymer content makes filter cake from a belt press filter more suited to the aforementioned disposal methods than a cake conditioned with ferric chloride and lime which can occur with other dewatering processes.&lt;ref name=DesignIR /&gt;

==Recent developments==
Significant developments in belt press filter technology include: cloth developments, using three belts and, the V-fold belt. Cloth developments include the double weave which incorporates different yarn types to combine the specific advantages of each.&lt;ref name=Perry /&gt; A double weave woven wire belt is also available which has a better life span and durability than a conventional wire belt.&lt;ref name=SyntheticBelts&gt;http://spirofil-averinox.com/product-groups/synthetic-woven-belts Spirofil-Averinox , 2012, "Synthetic Woven Belts &amp; Synthetic Filter Cloth", Spirofil-Averinox, viewed 2nd  October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

A belt press filter using three belts can achieve independent speeds and have different belt types for the pressure and gravity zones.&lt;ref name= KSIII /&gt;&lt;ref name=BDPwebsite&gt;http://www.engamerica.com/uploaded/Doc/BDP_Belt_Filter_Press.pdf, BDP Industries, "Model 3DPTM Belt Filter Press", BDP Industries New York, USA, viewed 2 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the filter system to accommodate higher hydraulic loadings occurring with dilute feed sludge (feed solid concentration below 1.5%).  The three belt system is more efficient with both a higher production rate and cake solid concentration at the expense of mechanical complexity.&lt;ref name= KSIII /&gt;

The V-fold belt is similar to the belt filter press with the main difference being that only a single belt, folded along the centreline is used. The technology has not been widely proven. A final dry weight solids content of 9-13% can usually be achieved; this is smaller than competing technologies. Currently this technology is suited to small-scale applications (up to approximately 3000 L of slurry per hour as the maximum belt size is 0.75 m). V-fold belts have a small footprint, low energy and wash water consumption and low capital and operating costs. They are self-tracking and can process sludge of varying composition, reducing operator involvement.&lt;ref name=VFold&gt;Young. D, Ochre. P, and Kuijvenhoven. K,  ''V-Fold Belt Dewatering Technology'', 31st Annual Qld Water Industry Workshop – Operations Skills, University Central Queensland 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of [[electronics]], a  '''bootstrap'''  circuit is one where part of the output of an amplifier stage is applied to the input, so as to alter the input [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the amplifier. When applied deliberately, the intention is usually to increase rather than decrease the impedance.  &lt;ref&gt; ''IEEE Standard 100  Authoritative Dictionary of IEEE Standards Terms, Seventh Edition'', IEEE Press, 2000 {{ISBN|0-7381-2601-2}} page 123 &lt;/ref&gt; Generally, any technique where part of the output of a system is used at startup is described as bootstrapping. 

In the domain of [[MOSFET]] circuits, "bootstrapping" is commonly used to mean pulling up the [[operating point]] of a transistor above the power supply rail.&lt;ref name="Uyemura1999"&gt;{{cite book|author=John P. Uyemura|title=CMOS Logic Circuit Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udv--YBwA7sC&amp;pg=PA319|year=1999|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-0-7923-8452-6|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pelgrom2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marcel J.M.

==Input impedance==
[[File:Emitter follower.png|thumb|400px|Bootstrap capacitors C1 and C2 in a BJT emitter follower circuit]]
In [[analog circuit]] designs, a bootstrap circuit is an arrangement of components deliberately intended to alter the [[input impedance]] of a circuit. Usually it is intended to increase the impedance,  by using a small amount of positive [[feedback]], usually over two stages. This was often necessary in the early days of [[bipolar junction transistor|bipolar]] [[transistor]]s, which inherently have quite a low input impedance. Because the feedback is positive, such circuits can suffer from poor stability and noise performance compared to ones that don't bootstrap.

''Negative'' feedback may alternatively be used to bootstrap an input impedance, causing the apparent impedance to be reduced. This is seldom done deliberately, however, and is normally an unwanted result of a particular circuit design. A well-known example of this is the [[Miller effect]], in which an unavoidable feedback capacitance appears increased (i.e. its impedance appears reduced) by negative feedback.  One popular case where this ''is'' done deliberately is the [[Frequency compensation#Dominant-pole compensation|Miller compensation]] technique for providing a low-frequency pole inside an integrated circuit.  To minimize the size of the necessary capacitor, it is placed between the input and an output which swings in the opposite direction.  This bootstrapping makes it act like a larger capacitor to ground.

==Driving MOS transistors==
A N-[[MOSFET]]/[[Insulated-gate bipolar transistor|IGBT]] needs a significantly positive charge (''V&lt;sub&gt;GS&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; V''&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;) applied to the gate in order to turn on. Using only N-channel MOSFET/IGBT devices is a common cost reduction method due largely to [[Die (integrated circuit)|die]] size reduction&lt;!-- Source needed citing cost reduction from use of nMOS over pMOS devices. --&gt; (there are other benefits as well). However, using nMOS devices in place of pMOS devices means that a voltage higher than the power rail supply (V+) is needed in order to bias the transistor into linear operation (minimal current limiting) and thus avoid significant heat loss.

A bootstrap capacitor is connected from the supply rail (V+) to the output voltage. Usually the source terminal of the N-[[MOSFET]] is connected to the [[cathode]] of a recirculation [[diode]] allowing for efficient management of stored energy in the typically inductive load (See [[Flyback diode]]). Due to the charge storage characteristics of a capacitor, the bootstrap voltage will rise above (V+) providing the needed gate drive voltage.

A [[MOSFET]]/[[IGBT]] is a voltage-controlled device which, in theory, will not have any gate current. This makes it possible to utilize the charge inside the capacitor for control purposes. However, eventually the capacitor will lose its charge due to parasitic gate current and non-ideal (i.e. finite) internal resistance, so this scheme is only used where there is a steady pulse present. This is because the pulsing action allows for the capacitor to discharge (at least partially if not completely). Most control schemes that use a bootstrap capacitor force the high side driver (N-MOSFET) off for a minimum time to allow for the capacitor to refill. This means that the [[duty cycle]] will always need to be less than 100% to accommodate for the parasitic discharge unless the leakage is accommodated for in another manner.

==Switch-mode power supplies==
In [[switch mode power supplies|switch-mode power supplies]], the regulation circuits are powered from the output. To start the power supply, a leakage resistance can be used to trickle-charge the supply rail for the control circuit to start it oscillating. This approach is less costly and more efficient than providing a separate linear power supply just to start the regulator circuit. &lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Mack ''Demystifying switching power supplies'' Newnes, 2005 {{ISBN|0-7506-7445-8}},  page 121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Output swing==
AC amplifiers can use bootstrapping to increase output swing.  A capacitor (usually referred as ''bootstrap capacitor'') is connected from the output of the amplifier to the [[bias circuit]], providing bias voltages that exceed the power supply voltage.  Emitter followers can provide rail-to-rail output in this way, which is a common technique in class AB audio amplifiers.&lt;br /&gt;

==Digital integrated circuits==
Within an integrated circuit a bootstrap method is used to allow internal address and clock distribution lines to have an increased voltage swing.  The bootstrap circuit uses a coupling capacitor, formed from the gate/source capacitance of a transistor, to drive a signal line to slightly greater than the supply voltage. &lt;ref&gt; William J. Dally, John W. Poulton, ''Digital systems engineering'', Cambridge University Press, 1998 {{ISBN|0-521-59292-5}} pages 190-191 &lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Buddhist Digital Resource Center''' (BDRC) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to seeking out, preserving, organizing, and disseminating Buddhist literature. Joining digital technology with scholarship, BDRC ensures that the ancient wisdom and cultural treasures of the [[Buddhist]] literary tradition are not lost, but are made available for future generations. BDRC is committed to seeking out, preserving, organizing, and disseminating Buddhist literature. Current programs focus on the preservation of texts in [[Pali]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Sanskrit]], and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]].

==History==
In 2017, [[Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center|TBRC]] announced the expansion of institutional mission to include the preservation of texts in languages beyond [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]], including [[Sanskrit]], [[Pali]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. To reflect this expansion, they have officially changed organizational name from [[Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center]] (TBRC) to Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC). In 2017, BDRC will begin preserving and making accessible texts in languages beyond Tibetan, starting with [[Pali]], [[Sanskrit]], and [[Chinese language|Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tbrc.org/?locale=bo#!footer/news/20170210 Introducing Buddhist Digital Resource Center (BDRC)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Calligraffiti''' is an art form that combines [[calligraphy]], [[typography]], and [[graffiti]]. It can be classified as either [[abstract expressionism]] or abstract vandalism. It is defined as a visual art that integrates letters into compositions that attempt to communicate a broader message through writing that has been aesthetically altered to move beyond the literal meaning. Simply put, it is the conscious effort of making a word or group of words into a visual composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artcritical.com/2013/09/16/calligraffiti-at-leila-heller/|title=Calligraphy, Meet Graffiti: Calligraffiti at Leila Heller Gallery - artcritical|date=16 September 2013|website=Artcriticial.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such it is meant to be both an aesthetic experience and provocative art—mixing tradition and precision with modern unbridled self-expression.

==Definition and brief history==

[[File:Calligrafiti-assilah-morocco-2013.jpg|thumb|Wall mural, composed of Arabic letters, in a public street, Assilah, Morocco, 2013]]

The origins of the term, "calligraffiti" are unclear. The Dutch artist [[Niels Shoe Meulman]] is often incorrectly credited with coining the term in 2007, when he used it as the title of his solo exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance, Sinno, N., ''War of Colors: Beirut Street Art and the Reclamation of Public Space,'' ''ASAP/Journal,'' Vol. 2, No. 1, 2017, pp. 71-104 as an example of an art historian who credits Muelman, with coining the term and locates it as a form of street art.&lt;/ref&gt; Muelman describes calligraffiti as "traditional handwriting with a metropolitan attitude" and a "way of translating the art of the street to the interior of museums, galleries and apartments." In an interview he explains the technique itself as "directness in the whole, finesse in the details. An even balance between seeing and reading word and image. … letters, writing and language itself becomes an image or abstraction. On the other hand, basic shapes and splats become language."'&lt;ref&gt;Meulman, N. S., ''Calligraffiti: The Graphic Art of Niels Shoe Meulman,'' Urheberrechtlich geschutztes Material, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;   

Use of the term, however, predates the contributions of Niels Shoe Meulman by at least thirty years. The Canadian painter, [[Brion Gysin]] used the term in his final exhibition, ''Calligraffiti of Fire'' held at the Galerie Samy Kinge in Paris between 19 April and 19 May in 1986 and the term was also used as the title of the book which accompanied Gysin's exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Hoptman, L.J. (ed.), ''Brion Gysin: Dream Machine,'' Merrell, 2010, p. 131; Ballantyne, E., Dvořák, M. and Irvine, D. (eds). ''Translocated Modernisms: Paris and Other Lost Generations,'' University of Ottawa Press, 2016 [e-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was also used in a book about post-modernism, ''Spirits Hovering Over the Ashes: Legacies of Postmodern Theory'' by [[H.L. Hix]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Hix, H.L., ''Spirits Hovering over the Ashes: Legacies of Postmodern Theory,'' State University of New York Press 1995, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordanian artist and art historian [[Wijdan Ali]] also used the term, "calligraffiti" in her book, ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' (1997) to describe a style of art that had been flourishing across the Middle East and North Africa from the mid-20th century. She defined calligraffiti as the use of  "script of ordinary writing where the work is composed of the artist's personalised handwriting within a modern composition." &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 166-67 and also cited in Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; Ali wanted to use the term because she saw this type of art as being inspired by calligraphy yet, also close to the scribbling of graffiti artists. Pioneer artists in this style include: [[Hassan Massoudy]], [[Hossein Zenderoudi]] and [[Parviz Tanavoli]]. &lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p.80&lt;/ref&gt; Ali locates calligraffiti art as a distinct style within the School of Calligraphic Art (also known as the [[Hurufiyya movement]]).&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 165-172&lt;/ref&gt; 

Calligraffiti is distinguished from other styles of calligraphic art (such as ''Pure Calligraphy, Neoclassical, Modern Classical, Freeform, Abstract calligraphy, Calligraphic Combinations and Unconscious Calligraphy)'' in that it has no rules and artists require no formal training.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;  Whereas, traditional calligraphy in the Islamic world is bound by very strict rules, not the least a prohibition on using representations of the human form in manuscripts, calligraffiti artists break free from such rules and allow themselves to reshape and deconstruct letters as well as to combine them with other symbols and figures in creative ways.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraffiti artists are not confined to the use of actual letters. Instead, they go beyond a simple transformation of Arabic or English-language words into visual compositions, and invent new languages. &lt;ref&gt;Carrier, D., "Calligraphy, Meet Graffiti: Calligraffiti at Leila Heller Gallery," ''Artcritical,'' [Online art magazine], 16 December, 2013 [http://www.artcritical.com/2013/09/16/calligraffiti-at-leila-heller/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ali also makes a distinction between ''calligraffiti'' and ''pseudo-calligraffiti.''  Straight calligraffiti refers to the use of calligraphy without the rules of proportion while pseudo-calligraffiti is a total abstraction in which the letters may or may not be legible. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., "The Status of Islamic Art in the Twentieth Century," ''Muqarnas,'' vol. 9, 1992, pp 186-188 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1523143 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of calligraffiti appears to have begun in the Middle East and North Africa in around the 1950s, when local artists, searching for a visual language that expressed their national identity and heritage, began incorporating Arabic letters, as a graphic form, into their artworks.&lt;ref&gt;Issa, R., Cestar. J. and Porter,V., ''Signs of Our Times: From Calligraphy to Calligraffiti,''New York, Merrill, 2016; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' Online: https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/;Tuohy {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180611074834/https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/# |date=2018-06-11 }}, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists such as the Lebanese painter and poet, [[Etel Adnan]] (b. 1925); the Egyptian painter, Ramzi Moustafa (b. 1926) and the Iraqi painter-sculptor and philosopher, [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]] (b.1925) all searched for ways to use Arabic letters in abstract compositions. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 167-169; it should be noted that not all art historians classify Shakir Hassan Al-Said in the list of calligraffiti artists. Nadia Shabout, for example, argues that he does not fit the definition of a calligraffiti artist because he aimed for a total deconstruction of the letter. Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p.80&lt;/ref&gt;

The incidence of calligraffiti gathered momentum during the early 21st-century when Middle Eastern street artists co-opted urban spaces for calligraffiti art designed to convey political or provocative statements. This street art practice was especially conspicuous during the wave of uprisings between 2010 and 2013, that became known as the ''Arab Spring'' thereby bringing the art form to the attention of international audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Naguib, S.A., "Engaged Ephemeral Art: Street Art and the Egyptian Arab Spring," ''Transcultural Studies,'' Vol. 2, 2016, pp 53-86&lt;/ref&gt; Certain calligraffiti artists have credited the Middle Eastern calligraphy artists as an important influence on their work. For instance, the Tunisian calligraffiti artist, [[el Seed]] points to the work of Iraqi painter, [[Hassan Massoudy]] as a major source of inspiration, noting that "The work of Hassan Massoudy was totally out of anything I’ve seen from the way he shapes the letters to the colors he uses. He completely revolutionized the art of calligraphy.” &lt;ref&gt;Saldaña, S., "Reviving Arabic Calligraphy: An Encounter with Iraqi-French artist Hassan Massoudy," ''Mosaic Stories,'' 10 March, 2017, [http://www.mosaicstories.org/2017/03/10/reviving-arabic-calligraphy-encounter-iraqi-french-artist-hassan-massoudy/ Online:}&lt;/ref&gt;



===Characteristics===
Calligraffiti is a complex process. Its specificity is in its paradoxical nature, as it is characterised by and composed of many elements that appear contradictory: 
* blending of tradition and modernity
* sharing of culture and political subversion
* beauty and provocation 
* precision and spontaneity 
* philosophical and reactionary
* literal and metaphorical
It requires an overall vision from the artist- from the message he is trying to convey, to the shape of the letters, to the larger picture he is creating. Calligraffiti artist, Tubs, explains that the art form’s graffiti component forces the artist to reflect upon and consciously create a piece that will arouse a specific feeling or reaction in the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.threadless.com/art-to-the-letter-meet-artist-tubs/|title=Art To The Letter: Meet Artist Tubs - Threadless Blog|date=17 February 2015|website=Blog.threadless.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of the alphabet as an artistic medium&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artistsofutah.org/15bytes/11oct/page6.html|title=Jerry Hardesty - Toni Youngblood|first=Artists of|last=Utah|website=artistsofutah.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; demands practice, accuracy, and foresight.

===Tools===
Part of what differentiates calligraffiti from calligraphy is its freedom from rules. Calligraphy is a meticulous and specific art that takes years to master. Most calligraffiti artists, like El Seed, do not consider themselves calligraphers because they do not know, nor do they follow the many rules of calligraphy.&lt;ref name="qatartodayonline.com"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.qatartodayonline.com/i-am-not-a-revolutionary-artist/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-03-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509101803/http://www.qatartodayonline.com/i-am-not-a-revolutionary-artist/# |archive-date=2016-05-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraffiti on the other hand is characterized by its diversity of mediums, methods, and instruments. Each individual artist uses and sometimes designs his or her own tools.

==Calligraffiti in the Middle East and North Africa==
Arabic calligraphy is incredibly rich; it is an art form that has been perfected for well over a millennium. Islamic tradition greatly encouraged the development of calligraphy as an art form in order to assist religion began to spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenprophet.com/2012/02/arabic-calligraphy/|title=Arabic Calligraphy – eL Seed's Writing Is On the Wall|website=Greenprophet.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arabic writing represents the word of God revealed to Mohammed, which gives Arabic letters a special meaning. &lt;ref&gt; Bloom J. and Blair, S., ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2009, Vol. 2, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread and evolution of calligraphy can be traced very specifically throughout Islamic history as it is inherently tied to the spread of Islam itself. Calligraphy was how scribes transcribed and created Qur'ans—allowing Mohammad's message to extend beyond the Arabian Peninsula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zakariya.net/history/index.html|title=Arabic Calligraphy History - Tools, Techniques, Ahar Paper|website=Zakariya.net|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraphy has always had a central role in Middle Eastern art because of Islamic restrictions concerning the portrayal of human beings. As a result, calligraphy became not only a mechanism for the expansion of Islam, but a way to create religious art.&lt;ref name="ajammc.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ajammc.com/2013/09/17/word-as-image-contextualizing-calligraffiti-1984-2013-with-french-tunisian-street-artist-el-seed/|title=Word As Image: Contextualizing "Calligraffiti: 1984-2013" with French-Tunisian Street Artist eL Seed - Ajam Media Collective|date=17 September 2013|website=Ajammc.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calligraffiti: calligraphy of the 21st century===
Calligraffiti has emerged quite forcefully in the Middle East in recent years, particularly in the wake of the Arab uprisings. While graffiti has never been widespread in the region, it has spread with the rising dissidence against Middle Eastern dictatorships and authoritarian regimes. Calligraphy artist [[Hassan Massoudy]] called Arabic calligraphy and graffiti "two daughters of the same parents" because of their interrelationship. He notes thtat "Obviously [calligraphy and graffiti] both are about the use of letter and their alphabets, and their center of gravity is the beauty of writing. For both, a letter is more than just a letter and they fill them with emotions. The use of empty space and composition within this space is something else they have in common.&lt;ref&gt;Massoudy, H., "Two Daughers of the Same Parents," in: Don Stone Karl and Pascal Zoghbi, ''Arabic Calligraphy,'' From Here to Fame Publishing, 2011, pp 31-35&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraffiti is a logical evolution of the two art forms coexisting in the same space.

The first step towards calligraffiti was the emergence of the abstract movement in the Middle East during the 20th century. Calligraphy was impacted by the abstract movement in the 1960s and 1970s with the introduction of the [[Hurufiyya movement]] in the Arab world and the Saqqa Khaneh movement in Iran. [[Hassan Massoudy]], [[Hossein Zenderoudi]] and [[Parviz Tanavoli]] were some of the pioneers of this new era of calligraphy. The next two decades saw an initial explosion of graffiti in the context of the first Intifada and the Lebanese Civil War.&lt;ref name="ajammc.com"/&gt; Today, much calligraffiti is influenced by early Islamic script styles like siah [[mashq]] and [[Kufic]]. Artist and activist, Janet Kozak, characterizes calligraffiti artists in the Middle East as being "not bound by the shackles of tradition, yet still indebted to it" who use "a unique blend of traditional scripts and design mixed with modern materials and techniques".

==Beyond the aesthetic==
Calligraffiti has been a way for artists in the Middle East to reclaim the region while still staying grounded in their culture and tradition. From the civil war in Beirut, to the Palestinian intifadas, to the Arab uprisings, calligraffiti has become a mechanism for social and political protest—where letters become symbols.&lt;ref name="printingmuseum.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.printingmuseum.org/eventdetail.php?id=162|title=The Exhibitions at the Museum of Printing History|website=Printingmuseum.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most salient characteristics of the Arab Spring has been the reappropriation of the public sphere and calligraffiti does just that. Calligraffiti is an urban art as much as it is a gallery art, and as such it has served as a tool to reclaim public spaces and impose the will and opinion of the people. Once an infrequent sight, graffiti and calligraffiti now adorn the walls of most major cities in the Middle East, representing the rising political and social tensions in the region. Despite most artists' claims that they are neither political or social actors, their art has inevitable impact—as Saudi artist Rana Jarbou said "words are weapons".

===Political uses===
Many calligraffiti artists contest the idea that their art is political. Askar insists his calligraffiti pieces in Palestine do not make him a political activist, he says "I protest in colors, my activism consists of bringing art to the streets and allowing the public to express themselves"; similarly, El Seed has said "I don’t have any political agenda. I don’t believe in politics".&lt;ref name="qatartodayonline.com"/&gt; But by nature, calligraffiti is meant to express a message, and so it has unavoidable social and political consequences.

Protesting political affairs has been the subject of much of the graffiti in the region, and calligraffiti has not escaped this. Much of the anonymous calligraffiti that emerged from the Arab Spring is deeply embedded in a political struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muftah.org/telling-story-arab-spring-interactive-graffiti-map/#.VuwuBJMrLVo|title=Telling the Story of the Arab Spring: an Interactive Graffiti Map|website=muftah.org|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Seed’s 2011 mural in Kairouan Tunisia, a poem by Abu al-Qasim al-Husayafi about tyranny and injustice, cannot be separated from the political context it was created in. Similarly, Askar’s piece entitled "Palestine" cannot be separated from the political weight the word "Palestine" holds; nor can his piece that says "salaam" (meaning peace), that is shaped like a key, escape the symbolism of the key in the Palestinian occupation. Anonymous calligraffiti on the Israeli wall in Bethlehem is inherently political because of its location.

The exhibit "Contemporary Arabic Graffiti and Lettering" explores how Calligraffiti creates a dialogue between the social and political sphere, by questioning dominant beliefs and ideologies. It does this by imposing itself on the religious and political debates by commandeering public spaces.&lt;ref name="printingmuseum.org"/&gt; Khadiga El Ghawas is one calligraffiti artist that does not shy away from the political messages of her art. She says "My compositions touch upon issues that we currently face in Egypt whether that’s related to politics, religion or society". Her work very explicitly deals with the political realities of Egypt, whether it is political Islam, democracy, or women's issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/|title=The Daily Beast|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social uses===
Calligraffiti, as art, has the power to influence society and the people who are exposed to it. For example, it can be used to bring awareness to lost memories or forgotten moments in history. Inkman's USINA project decorates the forgotten limestone factory walls in Boukornine Tunisia to remind the world of those who struggled there and pay them respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isupportstreetart.com/usina-story-of-brave-men/|title="USINA" Story of brave men - I Support Street Art|date=22 January 2015|website=Isupportstreetart.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Seed's Lost Walls project attempts to redirect the world and Tunisia's attention to the beauty of the country. His purpose was to create hope in Tunisia; that the people of the country could rediscover something positive and be proud of their culture in the midst of political turmoil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alartemag.be/en/en-culture/el-seeds-graffiti-road-trip-through-tunisia/|title=eL Seed's graffiti road trip through Tunisia - al.arte.magazine|date=11 June 2014|website=Alartmag.be|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lebanese artist Yazan Halwani says his art is means to "write the stories of the city, on its own walls—creating a memory for the city". The civil war created a deep fragmentation within the Lebanese society and a sense of amnesia that Halwani sought to fight against. His calligraffiti is meant to portray the city in a positive light, repair social ties and breathe life into a broken society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/22/beirut-graffiti-artist-yazan-halwani-lebanese|title=How a Beirut graffiti artist is using his murals to try to unite a fragmented city|first=Ellie Violet|last=Bramley|date=22 September 2015|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; GhalamDAR, an Iranian artist, tries to reconnect Iranians to their country and culture. He often questions contemporary identity, philosophy, and history in Iran, which can be seen in his piece on the Iranian diaspora that features a headless deer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aquila-style.com/focus-points/muslimlifestyle/ghalamdar-persian-calligraffiti-sensation/101500/|title=GhalamDAR: Persian calligraffiti sensation|website=Aquila-style.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calligraffiti has been a way for all of these artists to try and better the communities they live in.

Another way in which calligraffiti has impacted the social sphere is by engaging a discuss about contemporary issues and bringing people together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theculturetrip.com/africa/tunisia/articles/tunisia-s-first-calligraffiti-artist-el-seed-politics-power-and-paint/|title=Tunisia's Pioneering 'Calligraffiti' Artist eL Seed|first=Isabella|last=Bengoechea|website=Theculturestrip.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Seed's calligraffiti on the Gabes mosque is a quotation from the Qur'an meant to address intolerance, specifically in regards to religion, art, and the growing Islamist movement in the world. The quote reads "Oh humankind, we have created you from a male and a female and made people and tribes so you may know each other"; it attempts to break stereotypes and opens a discussion around the place of art in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/09/arab-graffiti-vandalism-art-spring|title=Arab graffiti: vandalism or art? - Mohamed El Hebeishy|first=Mohamed El|last=Hebeishy|date=9 September 2012|newspaper=the Guardian|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing his project "Perception" in Cairo, El Seed explained that he is "questioning the level of judgment and misconception society can unconsciously have upon a community based on their differences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourmiddleeast.com/culture/calligraffiti-master-astonishes-with-remake-of-marginalized-cairo-neighborhood_39640|title="Calligraffiti" master astonishes with remake of marginalized Cairo neighborhood|website=Yourmiddleeast.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; El Seed has referred to himself as an "artivist", or an artist and an activist at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2012/04/where-art-blends-with-activism/|title=Where art blends with activism|date=5 April 2012|website=News.harvard.edu=|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calligraffiti: between Middle East and West==
Many calligrafitti artists use Arabic script or are heavily inspired by it. There has been a rise in Arabic calligraffiti outside the Middle East and by non Middle Eastern artists. Arabic calligraffiti has become a cosmopolitan art form. This can partially be attributed to the richness of Arabic calligraphy compared to other scripts. The use of Arabic calligraphy has been a typographic decision by many artists who seek to reinvent the aesthetic.&lt;ref name="ajammc.com"/&gt;

===A search for identity===
The widespread use of Arabic calligraphy outside the Middle East is often a result of political and social dynamics.&lt;ref name="printingmuseum.org"/&gt; Colonization and immigration has led to an identity crisis in many people, one the artist El Seed often talks about. He says his style developed from his struggle to fit in; the feeling that while he was not French, he was not fully Tunisian either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehoya.com/artist-explains-calligraffiti/|title=Artist Explains 'Calligraffiti'|date=27 September 2013|website=Thehoya.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legacy of colonization has created hybrid identities, especially in Europe, but has also allowed other cultures to be exposed to Middle Eastern cultures. As a result, artists like Julien Breton and L'atlas have adopted the Arabic script style. Artists like Aerosol Arabic or Haji Noor Deen turned to Arabic calligraffiti after they converted to Islam. Many artists use calligraffiti to reconnect with cultural and historical identities that they lost, or as a way to find a new identity.&lt;ref name="printingmuseum.org"/&gt;

==Artists==
Calligraffiti is a relatively new term and graffiti is still taboo in  parts of the Middle East and Asia, and as a result many calligraffiti artists are anonymous or rely on pseudonyms. Additionally, many calligraphers have created calligraffiti pieces, even though it is not their primary focus. In 2015, Niels Shoe Meulman created the Calligraffiti Ambassadors with the aim of expanding the movement and creating a community of calligraffiti artists. The group has already grown since its inception and includes artists from all over the world. They exhibited some of their work at the Affenfaust Gallery in Hamburg, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calligraffitiambassadors.com/|title=Calligraffiti Ambassadors|website=Calligraffitiambassadors.com|accessdate=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catherine de' Medici's patronage of the arts''' made a significant contribution to the [[French Renaissance]]. [[Catherine de' Medici|Catherine]] was inspired by the example of her father-in-law, [[Francis I of France|King Francis I of France]] (reigned 1515–1547), who had hosted the leading artists of Europe at his court. As a young woman, she witnessed at first hand the artistic flowering stimulated by his patronage.&lt;ref name =K244&gt;Knecht, 244.&lt;/ref&gt; As governor and [[regent]] of France, Catherine set out to imitate Francis's politics of magnificence. In an age of civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display.

After the death of her husband, [[Henry II of France|Henry II]], in 1559,  Catherine governed France on behalf of her young sons [[Francis II of France|King Francis II]] (1559–60) and [[Charles IX of France|King Charles IX]] (1560–74). Once in control of the royal purse, she launched a program of artistic patronage which lasted for three decades. She continued to employ Italian artists and performers, including the artist-architect [[Primaticcio]]. By the 1560s, however, a wave of home-grown talent—trained and influenced by the foreign masters brought to France by Francis—came to the fore. Catherine patronised these new artists and presided over a distinctive late French-Renaissance culture. New forms emerged in literature, architecture, and the performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 220.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, as art historian Alexandra Zvereva suggests, Catherine became one of the great art collectors of the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name = z6&gt;Zvereva, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Catherine spent ruinous sums on the arts, the majority of her patronage had no lasting effect. The end of the Valois dynasty shortly after her death brought a change in priorities. Her collections were dispersed, her palaces sold, and her [[Catherine de' Medici's building projects|buildings]] were left unfinished or later destroyed. Where Catherine had made her mark was in the magnificence and originality of her famous [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals|court festivals]]. Today's ballets and operas are distantly related to Catherine de' Medici's court productions.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 245.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual arts==

An inventory drawn up at the [[Hôtel de la Reine]] after [[Catherine de' Medici]]'s death shows that she was a keen collector of art and curiosities. Works of art included [[tapestries]], hand-drawn maps, sculptures, and hundreds of pictures, many by Côme Dumoûtier and [[Benjamin Foulon]], Catherine's last official painters. There were rich fabrics, [[ebony]] furniture inlaid with [[ivory]], sets of china (probably from [[Bernard Palissy]]'s workshop), and [[Limoges]] pottery. Curiosities included fans, dolls, caskets, games, pious objects, a stuffed [[chameleon]], and seven stuffed crocodiles.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 240–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of Catherine's death in 1589, the Valois dynasty was in a terminal crisis; it became extinct with the death of Henry III only a few months later. Catherine's properties and belongings were sold off to pay her debts and dispersed with little ceremony. She had hoped for a far different posterity. In 1569, the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] ambassador had identified her with her [[House of Medici|Medici]] forebears: "One recognises in the queen the spirit of her family. She wishes to leave a legacy behind her: buildings, libraries, collections of antiquities".&lt;ref name = z6&gt;Zvereva, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the destruction, loss, and fragmentation of Catherine's heritage, a collection of portraits formerly in her possession has been assembled at the [[Château de Chantilly|Musée Condé, Château de Chantilly]].

===Portraits===

[[File:Margot 001.jpg|thumb| Catherine's daughter [[Marguerite de Valois]], by [[François Clouet]], c. 1560]]

The vogue for portrait drawings intensified during Catherine de' Medici's life, and she may have regarded part of her collection as the equivalent of today's family photograph album. Catherine loved having her children painted: "I would like", she wrote in 1547 to her children's governor, Jean d'Humières, "to have paintings of all the children done . . . and sent to me, without delay, as soon as they are finished".&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the more formal pictures include a high proportion of portraits of European kings and queens, past and present, most of which she probably commissioned personally.&lt;ref&gt;Dimier, 195. The similarity in sizes suggests that they were ordered to her specifications.&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 July 1571, Catherine wrote to Monsieur de la Mothe-Fénelon, ambassador in London, discussing the work of [[François Clouet]] and requesting a portrait of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]]. Catherine gave detailed instructions: "I pray you do me the pleasure that I may soon have a painting of the queen of England of small volume, in great [''de la grandeur''], and that it be well portrayed and done in the same fashion as the one sent be by the earl of Leicester, and ask, as I already have one in full face, it would be better to have her turning to the right."&lt;ref&gt;Jollet, 50: [https://archive.org/stream/correspondancedi00feneuoft#page/229/mode/1up ''Correspondance Diplomatique De Bertrand De Salignac De La Mothe Fenelon'', vol. 6, (1840), 229-231, 3 July 1571]&lt;/ref&gt;
The large group of portraits from Catherine's collection, now at the [[Château de Chantilly|Musée Condé, Château de Chantilly]], reveals her passion for the genre.&lt;ref&gt;See Zvereva, ''Les Clouet de Catherine de Médicis'', 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; These include portraits by [[Jean Clouet]] (1480–1541) and by his son François Clouet (c. 1510–1572). Jean drew and painted in the style of the Italian High Renaissance, but in the portraits of François, a northern-European [[naturalism (arts)|naturalism]] is apparent, and a flatter, more meticulous technique.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Anjou 1570louvre.jpg|thumb |left| Catherine's son [[Henry III of France|Henry, duke of Anjou]], by [[Jean Decourt]], c. 1573. The contemporary writer [[Jean Papire Masson]] passed on the story that as [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] was dying, he asked for this portrait to be brought from the artist's studio, in order to say goodbye to his brother, who was then in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;Dimier, 239.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

François Clouet drew and painted portraits of all Catherine's family as well as of many members of the court. His drawing has been called profound, owing to its accuracy and harmony of form and its psychological penetration.&lt;ref&gt;Dimier, 205–6.&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition of court portraiture was carried on by [[Jean Decourt]], Étienne, Côme, and Pierre Dumoûtier, and by the less polished [[Benjamin Foulon]] (François Clouet's nephew) and [[François Quesnel]]. The last two artists, plus another known as ''"Anonyme Lécurieux"'', tended to use a more stylised technique, producing flatter portraits, with less three-dimensional modelling.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 100; Jollet, 249–52.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Catherine de' Medici, a decline in the quality of portraiture set in; and by 1610, the native school patronised by the late Valois court and brought to its pinnacle by François Clouet had all but died out, and the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] became reliant on foreign artists.&lt;ref&gt;Dimier, 308–19; Jollet, 17–18. Technically, François Clouet's origins were [[Flemish people|Flemish]], since his father had arrived in Paris from Flanders prior to 1528; but François lived almost all of his life in France&lt;/ref&gt;

===Painting===

[[File:Caron-Antoine-triumph-of-winter.jpg| thumb| ''Triumph of Winter'', by [[Antoine Caron]], c. 1568.]]

Little is known about the painting at Catherine de' Medici's court.&lt;ref&gt;"There are few periods at which French painting was at a lower ebb than in the last quarter of the sixteenth century and the first quarter of the seventeenth, and few periods about which we are more ignorant." Blunt, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last two decades of Catherine's life, only two painters stand out as recognisable personalities, [[Antoine Caron]] and [[Jean Cousin the Younger]]. The majority of paintings and portrait drawings that have survived from the late Valois period remain difficult or impossible to attribute to particular artists.

Antoine Caron became painter to Catherine de' Medici after working at [[Fontainebleau]] under [[Primaticcio]]. His vivid [[Mannerist]] style, with its love of ceremonial and [[allegory]],  perhaps reflects the peculiarly neurotic atmosphere of the French court during the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt calls Caron's style "perhaps the purest known type of Mannerism in its elegant form, appropriate to an exquisite but neurotic society". Blunt, 98, 100.&lt;/ref&gt; He adopted from [[Niccolò dell'Abbate]] the technique of elongated and twisted figures, placing them in spaces dominated by fantastical fragments of architecture borrowed from the drawings of [[Androuet du Cerceau|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]] and painted in surprising rainbow contrasts. The effect makes Caron's pin-headed figures appear puny and lost in the landscapes.&lt;ref name = B100&gt;Blunt, 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Caron's paintings, such as those of the ''Triumphs of the Seasons'', are of [[allegory|allegorical]] subjects that echo the festivities for which Catherine's court was famous. His designs for the [[Valois Tapestries]] depict the ''fêtes'', picnics, and mock battles of the "magnificent" entertainments for which Catherine was famous.&lt;ref name = "biic"&gt;Blunt, 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Caron often painted scenes of massacres, reflecting the background of civil war that cast a shadow over the magnificence of the court. Caron also painted [[astrology|astrological]] and [[prophecy|prophetical]] subjects, such as ''Astrologers Studying an Eclipse'' and '' Augustus and the Sibyl''. This theme may have been inspired by Catherine de' Medici's obsession with horoscopes and predictions.&lt;ref name = B100&gt;Blunt, 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Last Judgement. Jean Cousin..jpg| thumb| left|''The Last Judgement.'' by [[Jean Cousin the Younger]].]]

Jean Cousin, to judge by contemporary praise for his work, may have been as highly regarded at the time as Caron. The royal accounts show large payments made to Cousin: he was among those who decorated Paris for the entry of [[Henry II of France|Henry II as king]]. Little of his work, however, survives. His most important surviving work is ''The Last Judgement'' in the [[Louvre]], which like Caron's art, depicts human beings dwarfed by the landscape and, in Blunt's words, "made to swarm over the earth like worms".&lt;ref name = B100&gt;Blunt, 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tapestries===

{{main| Valois tapestries}}

Missing from the inventory drawn up after Catherine's death were the eight huge tapestries, known as the [[Valois tapestries]], now held at the [[Uffizi]] gallery in Florence, which depict "[[magnificences]]" such as those at Bayonne in 1565 during the summit meeting between the French and Spanish courts and the ball laid on at the [[Tuileries]] palace in 1573 by Catherine for the Polish envoys who offered the crown of their country to her son [[Henry III of France|Henry of Anjou]].&lt;ref name =K2423&gt;Knecht, 242–43.&lt;/ref&gt;  These magnificent hangings, originally designed during the reign of [[Charles IX of France|King Charles IX]] by [[Antoine Caron]] in the early 1570s,&lt;ref&gt;Dimier, 190. Caron was also responsible for a series of [[cartoons]] for tapestries on the theme of [[Artemisia II of Caria|Artemisia]], in honour of Catherine de' Medici.&lt;/ref&gt; were woven later in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] with additions, possibly designed by [[Lucas de Heere]],&lt;ref&gt;See ''The Valois Tapestries'' (1959), by [[Frances Yates]], who proposed de Heere as the designer of the additions.&lt;/ref&gt; who worked for Catherine between 1559 and 1565,&lt;ref&gt;Dimier, 216. The information about de Heere comes from [[Karel van Mander]] (1548–1606).&lt;/ref&gt; that show fashions as late as 1580 and depict Henry III as king rather than Charles IX.&lt;ref name =K2423&gt;Knecht, 242–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Frances Yates]] has suggested that these tapestries may have been produced in connection with the intervention of Catherine's son [[François, Duke of Anjou]], who was elected [[duke of Brabant]], in the Spanish Netherlands in 1580, in defiance of the Spanish administration. Anjou figures prominently in the tapestries. Catherine de’ Medici herself appears as a central figure in black in most of them.&lt;ref name=K242&gt;Knecht, 242.&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that she gave them to her granddaughter [[Christina of Lorraine]] in advance of her wedding to [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinand de’ Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] in 1589.&lt;ref name=K242 /&gt; The tapestries glorify the house of Valois by celebrating its magnificent festivals.&lt;ref name =K244&gt;Knecht, 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture==

According to the contemporary art historian [[Vasari]], Catherine wanted [[Michelangelo]] to make her husband Henry II's [[equestrian statue]]; but Michelangelo passed the commission on to [[Daniele da Volterra]], and only the horse was ever made.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 282; Knecht, 225. Da Volterra died in 1566. The horse did not reach France until the seventeenth century, when it was utilised for an equestrian statue of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]]. It was melted down during the [[French revolution]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Monument du coeur d'Henri II.jpg|thumb|left| Monument containing the heart of [[Henry II of France]], by [[Germain Pilon]] and [[Domenico del Barbieri|Domenico del Barbiere]].]]

On commission from Catherine, [[Germain Pilon]] carved the marble sculpture that contains Henry II's heart. The Florentine [[Domenico del Barbieri|Domenico del Barbiere]], who had worked at Fontainebleau, carved the base. Pilon's fluid style echoes Primaticcio's stucco work at Fontainebleau. The piece may also have been influenced by [[Pierre Bontemps]]'s monument for the heart of Francis I.&lt;ref name = "bxivc"&gt;Blunt, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Pilon set the bronze urn on the heads of the [[Charites|Three Graces]], who are poised back to back, as if to dance.&lt;ref&gt;Hoogvliet, 110.&lt;/ref&gt; He may have based the design on that for an incense burner for Francis I, engraved by [[Marcantonio Raimondi|Marcantonio]]. Pilon's figures, however, with their long necks and small heads, are more like nymphs.&lt;ref name = "bxivc"&gt;Blunt, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; A poem by Ronsard is engraved at the foot of the sculpture. It asks the reader not to wonder that so small a vase can hold so large a heart, since Henry's real heart resides in Catherine's breast.&lt;ref&gt;Hoogvliet, 111. Ronsard may refer to [[Artemisia II of Caria|Artemisia]], who drank the ashes of her dead husband, which fused with her own body.&lt;/ref&gt; Henri Zerner has called the monument, which can be seen at the [[Louvre]], "one of the summits of our sculpture".&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 225, quotes Henri Zerner, ''L’art de la Renaissance en France. L'invention du classicisme'', Paris: Flammarion, 1996, 354. The urn is a nineteenth-century restoration.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1580s, Pilon began work on statues for the chapels that were to circle the tomb of Catherine de' Medici and Henry II at the [[Basilique Saint-Denis|basilica of Saint Denis]]. Among these, the fragmentary ''Resurrection'', now in the Louvre, was designed to face the tomb of Catherine and Henry from a side chapel.&lt;ref&gt;Zerner, 383. Whereas the ''Resurrection'' for the tomb of Francis I had been positioned close to the corpses, this design would have involved the visitor.&lt;/ref&gt; This work owes a clear debt to [[Michelangelo Buonarroti|Michelangelo]], who had designed the tomb and funerary statues for Catherine's father at the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence|Medici chapels]] in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 95. Pilon based the Christ on [[Michelangelo Buonarroti|Michelangelo's]] cartoon for ''Noli me tangere'' (1531) and carved the soldiers in Michelangelo's ''[[contrapposto]]'' style.&lt;/ref&gt; Pilon openly depicted extreme emotion in his work, sometimes to the point of the grotesque. His style has been interpreted as a reflection of a society torn by the conflict of the [[French Wars of Religion|French wars of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

{{main| Catherine de' Medici's building projects}}

[[File:Drawing of an enlarged project of 1578 to 1579 for the Tuileries, by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau.jpg| thumb| Drawing by [[Androuet du Cerceau|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]] of an enlarged project of 1578–1579 for the Tuileries, with oval halls]]

Architecture was Catherine de' Medici's first love among the arts.  "As the daughter of the Medici", suggests French art historian Jean-Pierre Babelon, "she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died."&lt;ref&gt;Babelon, 263.&lt;/ref&gt; Having witnessed in her youth the huge architectural schemes of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] at [[Château de Chambord|Chambord]] and [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]], Catherine set out, after [[Henry II of France|Henry II's]] death, to enhance the grandeur of the [[House of Valois|Valois]] monarchy through a series of costly building projects.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 79, 455; Sutherland, ''Ancien Régime'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt; These included work on châteaux at Montceaux-en-Brie, [[Saint-Maur-des-Fossés]], and [[Château de Chenonceau|Chenonceau]], and the building of two new palaces in Paris: the [[Tuileries palace|Tuileries]] and the Hôtel de la Reine. Catherine was closely involved in the planning and supervising of all her architectural schemes.&lt;ref&gt;De l'Orme wrote that Catherine, with "an admirable understanding combined with great prudence and wisdom", took the trouble "to order the organization of her said palace [the Tuileries] as to the apartments and location of the halls, antechambers, chambers, closets and galleries, and to give the measurements of width and length". Quoted by Knecht, 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Architects of the day dedicated treatises to her in the sure knowledge that she would read them.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 91. For example, [[Androuet du Cerceau|Jacques Androuet du Cerceau]] dedicated his ''Les Plus Excellents Bastiments de France'' (1576 and 1579) to Catherine.&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]] accused her of preferring masons to poets.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Basilica di saint Denis tomba enrico II e caterina de' Medici 03.JPG| thumb| left| Effigies on the tomb of [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] and [[Catherine de' Medici]] at the [[Basilique Saint-Denis|basilica of Saint Denis]], carved by [[Germain Pilon]]&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 227. Henry's gesture is now unclear, since a [[missal]], resting on a [[prie-dieu]] (prayer desk), was removed from the sculpture during the French revolution and melted down.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Catherine was intent on immortalising her sorrow at the death of her husband and had emblems of her love and grief carved into the stonework of her buildings.&lt;ref name="Knecht, 223"&gt;Knecht, 223.&lt;/ref&gt; As the centrepiece of an ambitious new chapel, she commissioned a magnificent tomb for Henry at the [[Basilique Saint-Denis|basilica of Saint Denis]], designed by 
[[Francesco Primaticcio]]. In a long poem of 1562, Nicolas Houël, laying stress on her love for architecture, likened Catherine to [[Artemisia II of Caria|Artemisia]], who had built the [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum]] at [[Halicarnassus]], one of the [[Seven Wonders of the Ancient World]], as a tomb for her dead husband.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 266; Hoogvliet, 108. Louis Le Roy, in his ''Ad illustrissimam reginam D. Catherinam Medicem'' of 1560, was the first to call Catherine the "new Artemisia".&lt;/ref&gt;
Primaticcio's circular plan for the Valois chapel, by allowing the tomb to be viewed from all angles, solved the problems faced by the Giusti brothers and [[Philibert de l'Orme]], builders of previous royal tombs.&lt;ref&gt;Blunt, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Art historian Henri Zerner has called the design "a grand ritualistic drama which would have filled the rotunda's celestial space" and "the last and most brilliant of the royal tombs of the Renaissance".&lt;ref&gt;''L’art de la Renaissance en France. L'invention du classicisme'' (Zerner, 1996: 349–54), quoted by Knecht, 227; Zerner, 379.&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the building was abandoned in 1585, as the monarchy faced bankruptcy and a series of rebellions. Over two hundred years later, in 1793, a mob tossed Catherine and Henry's bones into a pit with the rest of the French kings and queens.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine de' Medici spent extravagant sums on the building and embellishment of monuments and palaces, and as the country slipped deeper into anarchy, her plans grew ever more ambitious.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the Valois monarchy was crippled by debt and its [[moral authority]] in steep decline. The popular view condemned Catherine's building schemes as obscenely wasteful. This was especially true in Paris, where the ''[[parlement]]'' was often asked to contribute to her costs.

[[Pierre de Ronsard|Ronsard]] captured the mood in a poem:

:''The queen must cease building,''
:''Her lime must stop swallowing our wealth…''
:''Painters, masons, engravers, stone-carvers''
:''Drain the treasury with their deceits.''
:''Of what use is her Tuileries to us?''
:''Of none, Moreau; it is but vanity.''
:''It will be deserted within a hundred years.''&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Knecht, 233. Ronsard addressed these lines to the financial official Raoul Moreau. ''Au tresorier de l'esparne'' (ca. 1573).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronsard was in many ways proved correct. Little remains of Catherine de' Medici's investment today: one [[Doric order|Doric]] column, a few fragments in the corner of the [[Tuileries]] gardens, an empty tomb at Saint Denis.

==Literature==

[[File:Antoine Caron Astronomers Studying an Eclipse.jpg|thumb|''Astrologers Studying an Eclipse'', by [[Antoine Caron]]: Catherine was fascinated by [[astronomy]] and [[astrology]] and had a tower built, the Colonne de l'Horoscope, possibly used for observation of the stars.&lt;ref name="Knecht, 223"/&gt;]]

Catherine believed in the humanist ideal of the learned Renaissance prince whose power depended on letters as well as arms, and she was familiar with the writing of [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]], among others, on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Hoogvliet, 109.&lt;/ref&gt; She enjoyed and collected books, and moved the royal collection to the [[Louvre]], her principal residence. She delighted in the company of learned men and women, and her court was highly literary. Her government officials, such as secretary-of-state [[Nicolas de Neufville, seigneur de Villeroy]], whose wife translated the epistles of [[Ovid]], were perfectly at home in literary circles.&lt;ref&gt;Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 153–56.&lt;/ref&gt; When she could find the time, Catherine occasionally wrote verses herself, which she would show to the court poets.&lt;ref&gt;Heritier, 460.&lt;/ref&gt; Her reading was not entirely highbrow, however. A superstitious woman, she believed implicitly in astrology and [[Fortune-telling|soothsaying]], and her reading matter included ''The Book of Sibyls'' and the [[almanacs]] of [[Nostradamus]].&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 221, 244–45&lt;/ref&gt;

Catherine patronised poets such as [[Pierre de Ronsard]], [[Rémy Belleau]], [[Jean-Antoine de Baïf]], and [[Jean Daurat|Jean Dorat]], who wrote verses, scripts, and associated literature for her court festivals, and for public events such as [[royal entries]] and royal weddings.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine even had Ronsard write a poem to [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth of England]], honouring a new peace treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Heritier, 238–39.&lt;/ref&gt; These poets were part of a group sometimes known as the ''[[Pléiade]]'', who forged a vernacular French literature on Greek and Latin models. They gave form to their interest in ancient poetry in ''vers mesurés'', a metric system that aspired to imitate classical poetic rhythms. Catherine de' Medici was also interested in Italian literature: [[Torquato Tasso|Tasso]] presented his ''Rinaldo'' to her, and [[Pietro Aretino|Aretino]] [[eulogy|eulogised]] her as "woman and goddess serene and pure, the majesty of beings human and divine".&lt;ref name =K234&gt;Knecht, 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre==

In 1559, Catherine and Henry II attended a performance of the tragedy ''Sophonisba'' by [[Gian Giorgio Trissino|Trissino]], adapted earlier by the poet [[Mellin de Saint-Gelais]] to Catherine's commission.&lt;ref&gt;Plazenet, 261.&lt;/ref&gt; The performance style of the day inserted musical interludes unrelated to the plot between the acts, devoted to praise of the royal court. Princesses and other high-ranking ladies performed on this occasion, which celebrated royal and noble marriages.&lt;ref name =K234&gt;Knecht, 234.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brantôme]], claimed in his memoirs that having seen ''Sophonisba'' shortly before her husband's death, Catherine refused to watch any more tragedies, believing the play had brought him bad luck. [[Tragedy]] went out of fashion at the court soon afterwards, replaced by the new genre of [[tragicomedy]], though the change in taste may have had less directly to do with Catherine than with the revulsion of the court against the violence of the times.&lt;ref name =K234&gt;Knecht, 234.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Genevra'', staged at [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] on 13 February 1564, adapted into French from an episode of [[Ludovico Ariosto|Ariosto's]] ''[[Orlando Furioso]]'', was the first tragicomedy known to have been performed for the French court.&lt;ref name =K234&gt;Knecht, 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Commedia dell'arte - troupe Gelosi.JPG| thumb| [[I Gelosi]] performing ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'', perhaps featuring [[Isabella Andreini]], in the late sixteenth century]]

Catherine enjoyed comedy and ''[[wiktionary:risqué|risqué]]'' humour.  She drew the line at obscenity, however: in 1567, after seeing ''Le Brave'', an adaptation of [[Plautus| Plautus's]] ''[[Miles Gloriosus (play)|Miles Gloriosus]]'' by one of her official poets [[Jean-Antoine de Baïf]], Catherine told the author to cut the "lascivious talk" of the classical writers.&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 235.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1570s, the Italian ''[[commedia dell'arte]]'' rose to popularity in France and became all the rage.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine was not, as has sometimes been supposed, the first to bring Italian comedy to France: [[Louis Gonzaga, Duke of Nevers]], himself an Italian, was the first to invite high-quality Italian players to France in 1571. The following year, two companies called [[I Gelosi]] appeared in Paris, and a performance was given to the court in [[Blois]]. A year later, I Gelosi performed during the celebrations for the marriage of Catherine's daughter [[Marguerite de Valois]] and [[Henry IV of France|Henry of Navarre]]. Further groups appeared under the same name in the reign of Catherine's son [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (1574–89).

==Court festivals==
{{main| Catherine de' Medici's court festivals}}

As queen consort of France, Catherine patronised the arts and the theatre, but not until she attained real political and financial power as queen mother did she begin the series of [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] and entertainments, sometimes called "magnificences", that dazzled her contemporaries and continue to fascinate scholars. The most famous of these were the court festivals mounted at [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]] and at [[Bayonne]] during [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX's]] royal progress of 1564–65; the entertainments for the Polish ambassadors at the [[Tuileries palace|Tuileries]] in 1573; and the celebrations following the marriages of Catherine's daughter [[Marguerite of Valois|Marguerite]] to [[Henry IV of France|Henry of Navarre]] in 1572 and of her daughter-in-law's sister, Marguerite of Lorraine, to [[Anne de Joyeuse|Anne, Duke of Joyeuse]], in 1581. On all these occasions, Catherine organised sequences of lavish and spectacular entertainments. Biographer Leonie Frieda suggests that "Catherine, more than anyone, inaugurated the fantastic entertainments for which later French monarchs also became renowned".&lt;ref name =FF&gt;Frieda, 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Catherine, these entertainments were worth their colossal expense, since they served a political purpose. Presiding over the royal government at a time when the French monarchy was in steep decline, she set out to show not only the French people but foreign courts that the Valois monarchy was as prestigious and magnificent as it had been during the reigns of [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and her husband [[Henry II of France|Henry II]].&lt;ref name =St&gt;Strong, 99.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, she believed these elaborate entertainments and sumptuous court rituals, which incorporated martial sports and tournaments of many kinds, would occupy her feuding nobles and distract them from fighting against each other to the detriment of the country and the royal authority.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, 51–52.&lt;br /&gt;• Catherine wrote to Charles IX: "I heard it said to your grandfather the King that two things were necessary to live in peace with the French and have them love their King: keep them happy, and busy at some exercise, notably tournaments; for the French are accustomed, if there is no war, to exercise themselves and if they are not made to do so they employ themselves to more dangerous [ends]". Quoted in Jollet, 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is clear, however, that Catherine regarded these festivals as more than a political and pragmatic exercise; she revelled in them as a vehicle for her creative gifts. A highly talented and artistic woman, Catherine took the lead in devising and planning her own musical-mythological shows and is regarded as their creator as well as their sponsor. Historian Frances Yates has called her "a great creative artist in festivals".&lt;ref name="Yates, 68"&gt;Yates, 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Though they were [[ephemeral]], Catherine's "magnificences" are studied by modern scholars as works of art.&lt;ref name =FF&gt;Frieda, 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine employed the leading writers, artists, and architects of the day, including [[Antoine Caron]], [[Germain Pilon]], and [[Pierre Ronsard]], to create the dramas, music, scenic effects, and decorative works required to animate the themes of the festivals, which were usually [[mythological]] and dedicated to the ideal of peace in the realm. It is difficult for scholars to reconstruct the exact form of Catherine's entertainments, but research into the written accounts, scripts, artworks, and [[tapestries]] that derived from these famous occasions has provided evidence of their richness and scale.

In the tradition of 16th-century royal festivals, Catherine de' Medici's magnificences took place over several days, with a different entertainment on each day. Often individual lords and ladies and members of the royal family were responsible for preparing one particular entertainment. Spectators and participants, including those involved in martial sports, would dress up in costumes representing mythological or romantic themes. Catherine gradually introduced changes to the traditional form of these entertainments. She forbade heavy [[jousting|tilting]] of the sort that led to the death of her husband in 1559; and she developed and increased the prominence of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments.

===Dance===

A distinctive new art form, the ''[[ballets de cour|ballet de cour]]'', emerged from the creative advances in court entertainment devised by Catherine de' Medici.&lt;ref&gt;Yates, 51; Strong, 102, 121–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian influence on the ''ballet de cour'' owed much to Catherine, who was Italian herself and had grown up in [[Florence]], where ''[[intermedio|intermedii]]'', patronised by her rich relatives, were a staple of court entertainments and a focus of innovation. These between-acts entertainments had evolved a unique artistic form of their own, with choral dances, masquerades (''mascherate''), and consecutive themes.&lt;ref&gt;Shearman, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Once in France, Catherine kept in touch with artistic innovations in Italy. She encouraged Italian dancing masters to accept posts in France, among them the Milanese [[Cesare Negri]], who introduced the skills of [[Dance figure|figured dancing]] to France, and Pompeo Diobono, whom Catherine employed as dancing master to her four sons.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, 39.&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant figure was [[Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx]] (his name gallicised from the Italian Baldassare da Belgiojoso), whom Catherine placed in charge of training dancers and producing performances at court.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, 40–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Frances Yates]] has credited Catherine as the guiding light of the ''ballets de cour'':
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was invented in the context of the chivalrous pastimes of the court, by an Italian, and a Medici, the Queen Mother. Many poets, artists, musicians, choreographers, contributed to the result, but it was she who was the inventor, one might perhaps say, the producer; she who had the ladies of her court trained to perform these ballets in settings of her devising.&lt;ref name="Yates, 68"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Siren from Ballet Comique de la Reine.jpg|thumb|left| A [[Siren (mythology)|siren]] from the ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'', 1581]]

The dance performances at the [[House of Valois|Valois]] court were conceived on a large scale, as elaborate, choreographed showpieces, sometimes performed by considerable forces. At the Château of Fontainebleau in 1564, the court attended a ball in which 300 "beauties dressed in gold and silver cloth" performed a choreographed dance.&lt;ref&gt;Frieda, 211.&lt;/ref&gt; In his illustrated ''Magnificentissimi spectaculi'', [[Jean Daurat|Jean Dorat]] described an intricate ballet, ''The Ballet of the Provinces of France'', performed for the Polish ambassadors at the Tuileries palace in 1573, in which sixteen nymphs, each representing a French province, distributed devices to the spectators as they danced. Choreographed by Beaujoyeulx, the dancers performed complex, interlaced figures and patterned movements, each expressing a certain moral or spiritual truth that the spectators, assisted by printed programmes, were expected to recognise.&lt;ref name="Lee, 42"&gt;Lee, 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The chronicler [[Agrippa d'Aubigné]] recorded that the Poles marvelled at the ballet.&lt;ref name="Knecht, 239"&gt;Knecht, 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Brantôme called the performance "the finest ballet that was ever given in this world" and praised Catherine for bringing prestige to France with "all these inventions".&lt;ref name="Knecht, 239"/&gt; Jean Dorat described the movements of the dancers in verse:

:They blend a thousand flights with a thousand pauses of the feet
:Now they stitch through one another like bees by holding hands
:Now they form a point like a flock of voiceless cranes.
:Now they draw close, intertwining with one another
:Creating an entangled hedge like a kind of bramble bush.
:Now this one and now that switches to a flat figure
:Which describes many letters without a tablet.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lee,  43.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the dance was over, Catherine invited the spectators to join  with the performers in a social dance.

[[File:Ballet 1582.png|thumb| The ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'', from an engraving of 1582]]

Over the years, Catherine increased the element of dance in her festive entertainments, and it became the norm for a major ballet to climax each series of magnificences. The ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'', devised under Catherine's influence, by [[Louise of Lorraine|Queen Louise]] for the Joyeuse Magnificences of 1581, is regarded by historians as the moment when the ''[[ballets de cour|ballet de cour]]'' assumed the character of a new art form. The theme of the entertainment was an invocation of cosmic forces to aid the monarchy, which at that time was threatened by the rebellion not only of Huguenots but of many Catholic nobles. Men were shown as reduced to beasts by [[Circe]], who held court in a garden at one end of the hall. Louise and her ladies, costumed as [[naiad]]s, entered on a chariot designed as a fountain and then danced a ballet of thirteen geometric figures. After being turned to stone by Circe, they were freed to dance a ballet of forty geometric figures. Four groups of dancers, each wearing a different-coloured costume, moved through a sequence of patterns, including squares, triangles, circles, and spirals.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, 45; Strong, 120–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The figured choreography that enacted the mythological and symbolic themes reflected the principle, derived from the ''[[Enneads]]'' of [[Plotinus]] (c. 205–270), of "cosmic dance", the imitation of heavenly bodies by human motion to produce harmony. This imitation was achieved in the dance through geometric choreography and figures based on the harmony of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt; The dance elements in the court festivities represented a response to the increasing political disharmony of the country.&lt;ref name="Lee, 42"/&gt; The ''Ballet Comique de la Reine'' marked the final transformation of court dance as a purely personal and social activity into a unified theatrical performance with a philosophical and political agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, 41. See also [http://www.graner.net/nicolas/arbeau/ ''Orchésographie''] (1588) by [[Thoinot Arbeau]], the first publication to [[dance notation|notate]]—in relation to music—the steps taken from social dances.&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to its synthesis of dance, music, verse, and setting, the production is regarded by scholars as the first authentic ballet.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===

The dance, verse, and musical elements of Catherine's entertainments increasingly reflected the principles of an academic movement—also influential in the [[Florentine Camerata]]—to unify the performing arts in what was believed to be the classical, Greek way. In 1570, [[Jean-Antoine de Baïf]] founded the [[Académie de Poésie et de Musique]], whose aim was to revive ancient metrical practices, and, though the academy was short lived, similar aims were adopted by the ''Académie du Palais'', founded in 1577. Both enterprises were supported by the Valois court. One result of this movement was ''[[Musique mesurée| Musique mesurée à l'antique]]'', in which the metres of music and verse were matched precisely, to create a new harmony. The theory was not merely technical but [[Renaissance humanism|humanistic]]; practitioners believed a harmonious combination of elements would produce benign moral and ethical effects on the audience. Dance was also subject to the new system and was designed to match the rhythms of the music and verse. The result was a new unified approach to the interrelationship between the performing arts.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Клод Лежен.jpg|right|thumb|[[Claude Le Jeune]], the leading composer of the day, wrote music for Catherine de' Medici's entertainments and for court ceremonies and religious occasions]]

The well-documented Joyeuse magnificences of 1581 provide the clearest evidence of the influence of this artistic movement on Catherine de' Medici's entertainments. The chief composer of music for the performances was [[Claude Le Jeune]] (1528–1600). His ''musique mesurée'' was played at the wedding itself, and his song "La Guerre" was sung during a foot-combat in the Louvre. He also wrote the music for an elaborate show on a sun-moon theme, once again setting ''vers mesurés'' to ''musique mesurée''.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 118.&lt;/ref&gt; For the ''Ballet Comique de la Reine'', the music was composed by the Sieur de Beaulieu. The musicians were fully incorporated in the dramatic whole: on one side of the performing space was a cloud containing costumed singers and musicians, and on the other, a [[grotto]], guarded by [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], containing a second band of musicians. Further groups of singers and musicians made various entries and exits during the five-and-a-half-hour performance. At one stage, [[Circe]] turned the dancers and musicians to stone.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 119–20.&lt;/ref&gt; When, at the climax of the show, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] descended from the heavens, forty singers and musicians performed a song in honour of the wisdom and virtue of the Valois monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 121.&lt;/ref&gt; Published accounts praised the length and variety of the music. The Jupiter music was called the "most learned and excellent music that had ever been sung or heard".&lt;ref&gt;Knecht, 241.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2015">The '''Chandrasekhar number''' is a [[dimensionless quantity]] used in magnetic [[convection]] to represent ratio of the [[Lorentz force]] to the [[viscosity]]. It is named after the [[India]]n [[astrophysicist]] [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]].

The number's main function is as a measure of the [[magnetic field]], being proportional to the square of a characteristic magnetic field in a system.

== Definition ==

The Chandrasekhar number is usually denoted by the letter &lt;math&gt;\ Q&lt;/math&gt;, and is motivated by a dimensionless form of the [[Navier-Stokes equation]] in the presence of a magnetic force in the equations of [[magnetohydrodynamics]]:

:: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\sigma}\left(\frac{\partial^{}\mathbf{u}}{\partial t^{}}\ +\ (\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u}\right)\ =\ - {\mathbf \nabla }p\ +\ \nabla^2 \mathbf{u}\ +\frac {\sigma}{\zeta} {Q}\ ({\mathbf \nabla} \wedge \mathbf{B}) \wedge\mathbf{B}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ \sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Prandtl number]], and &lt;math&gt;\ \zeta&lt;/math&gt; is the magnetic Prandtl number. 

The Chandrasekhar number is thus defined as:&lt;ref&gt;N.E. Hurlburt, P.C. Matthews and A.M. Rucklidge, "Solar Magnetoconvection," ''Solar Physics'', 192, p109-118 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

:: &lt;math&gt; {Q}\ =\ \frac{{B_0}^2 d^2}{\mu_0 \rho \nu \lambda} &lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;\ \mu_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic permeability]], &lt;math&gt;\ \rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[density]] of the fluid, &lt;math&gt;\ \nu&lt;/math&gt; is the [[kinematic viscosity]], and &lt;math&gt;\ \lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the [[magnetic diffusivity]]. &lt;math&gt;\ B_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ d&lt;/math&gt; are a characteristic magnetic field and a length scale of the system respectively.

It is related to the [[Hartmann number]], &lt;math&gt;\ H&lt;/math&gt;, by the relation:

:: &lt;math&gt; Q\ {=}\ H^2\ &lt;/math&gt;

'''claro fair trade''', commonly shortened to '''''claro''''' and written in [[Lower case|minuscules]], is a [[sustainability]]-oriented retail company based in [[Orpund]], Biel/Bienne administrative district, in the Swiss [[Canton of Bern]]. claro was initiated by [[Erklärung von Bern]], a sustainability-oriented independent solidarity development in Switzerland in 1977.&lt;ref name="woz-evb-20090122"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.woz.ch/0904/erklaerung-von-bern/erfinderinnen-des-fairen-handels|title=Erklärung von Bern: Erfinderinnen des fairen Handels|publisher=[[WOZ Die Wochenzeitung]] 04/2009|author=Susan Boos|language=German|date=2009-01-22|accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and orientation ==
{{main|Erklärung von Bern}}
The history of fair trade in Switzerland is closely linked to the rise of the solidarity movement in Switzerland in the 1970s, and the political development organizations such as the [[Erklärung von Bern]] (EvB) consumer actions. At that time, products such as coffee, bananas and jute were symbols of the growing support for displaying developmental contexts. At the same time consumers demanded more engagement for development aid without supporting the charity mentality. The success of these actions occurred to the establishment of a joint Swiss import central named ''OS3'' that was pioneering fair trade, and specialized in the sale of food and crafts from developing trading partners, i.e. small producers from economic marginal areas, an alternative approach to the world trade.&lt;ref name="sozialarchiv"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findmittel.ch/Archive/archNeu/Arclaro.html|title=claro fair trade AG|publisher=Schweizerisches Sozialarchiv: Archivfindmittel|author=|language=German|date=2014-04-17|accessdate=2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides ''OS3'', in 1977 EvB initiated the organisation ''Suisse Tiers Monde'' which became the first two claro fair trade labels; they resulted in the collaboration with ''Corr-the jute works'' situated in Bangladesh. In the following years the product line was expanded gradually, among them cane sugar from the Philippines and other agriculture products from the so-called third world countries, for example coffee from Tanzania, and tea from Sri Lanka, and the cooperative ''El Ceibo'' in Bolivia around 1985,&lt;ref name="hds"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D47101.php|title=Erklärung von Bern (EvB)|publisher=HDS|author=Andrea Weibel|language=German|date=2004-10-29|accessdate=2014-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as today the popular ''claro'' shops in Switzerland,&lt;ref name="zsz-20120426"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zsz.ch/artikel_54490.html |title=Fair-Trade-Läden müssen sich auf den Markt ausrichten |publisher=[[Zürichsee-Zeitung]] |author=Bettina Bernet-Hug and Silvia Luckner (photo) |language=German |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2015-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119044427/http://www.zsz.ch/artikel_54490.html |archivedate=2015-01-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; among other sustainable initiatives financially supported by the [[Alternative Bank Schweiz]] ABS.

In 1997 the ''claro fair trade'' cooperative was transformed into an [[Aktiengesellschaft]] according to the Swiss law. claro fair trade claims as ultimate goals the continuous improvement of the social, economic and environmental situation of their producers. These include the minimization of middlemen in favor of direct cooperation with local partners and supporting social projects. Whenever possible the products are certified by the Max Havelaar Foundation.&lt;ref name="sozialarchiv"/&gt;

== Weltladen and claro shops ==
''claro'' contributes its products in the so-called ''claro'' and associated ''Weltladen'' shops.&lt;ref name="claro-überuns"/&gt; As other sustainable corporations, there was a decrease in turnover the past fiscal years, mainly caused to reduced export of the products outside Switzerland.&lt;ref name="claro-jahresbericht-2014"/&gt;

The distributor claimed as of 2014, to support by its import activities more than 260 small producer groups and craft shops, and thus improved the living conditions of more than 100,000 people from the [[southern hemisphere]].&lt;ref name="claro-jahresbericht-2014"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1754">'''Computational representational understanding of mind''' ('''CRUM''') is a [[hypothesis]] in [[cognitive science]] which proposes that thinking is performed by [[computations]] operating on representations. This hypothesis assumes that the mind has [[Mental representation|mental representations]] analogous to [[data structures]] and computational procedures analogous to [[algorithms]], such that computer programs using algorithms applied to data structures can model the mind and its processes.

CRUM takes into consideration several theoretical approaches of understanding human [[cognition]], including [[logic]], [[:wikt:rule|rule]], [[concept]], [[analogy]], image, and connection based systems. These serve as the representation aspects of CRUM theory which are then acted upon to simulate certain aspects of human cognition, such as the use of [[rule-based systems]] in [[neuroeconomics]]. 

There is much disagreement on this hypothesis, but CRUM has high regard among some researchers {{citation needed|reason=Need link to sources|date=April 2016}}. Philosopher [[Paul Thagard]] called it "the most theoretically and experimentally successful approach to mind ever developed"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind: Introduction to Cognitive Science|last=Thagard|first=Paul|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2005|isbn=9780262701099|location=|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Background==

Cruz Garcia was born on 27 June 1983 in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cruz "Pensa" Garcia (born 1958) and Lourdes Santiago (born 1959). His father is an international athletic coach and physical trainer.  Cruz "Pensa" Garcia trained several Olympic athletes and world boxing champions. Boxers trained by Cruz "Pensa" Garcia include Puerto Rican [[International Boxing Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Felix Trinidad]], retired former champion [[Alex Sánchez (boxer)|Alex Sanchez]], and Argentinean former world champion [[Marcos Maidana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rafael, Dan|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/10078707/oscar-de-la-hoya-headlines-2014-boxing-hall-class  |title=De La Hoya in 2014 Class|publisher=''[[ESPN]]''|date= 4 December 2013|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Primera Hora|url=http://www.primerahora.com/deportes/boxeo/nota/afilaocomonavaja-147787/  |title=Afila'o Como Navaja |publisher=''Primera Hora''|date= 16 January 2008|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Morilla, Diego|url=http://espn.go.com/boxing/story/_/id/7008688/win-cost|title=Maidana: I Have to Win at All Cost|publisher=''[[ESPN]]''|date= 16 January 2008|accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of a family of athletes and coaches, Cruz and his brother Manuel Garcia (an international runner and CAC Junior Champion), were track and field athletes and trained alongside world class athletes and boxing champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ponce Ruiz, Luis|url=http://revistacruce.com/politica-sociedad/cruce-y-cruz-entrevista-en-tres-partes-al-arq-cruz-garcia-parte-2.html|title=Cruce y Cruz: Entrevista en Tres Partes al Arq.

A crucial point in Cruz Garcia's studies happened in 2008, during Felix Trinidad's last fight as a professional boxer. In his fight versus former world champion [[Roy Jones Jr.]], Trinidad brought Garcia as part of his training team to New York in order for him to complete his research on Narrative Architectures with pieces exposed in the Museum of Modern Art in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ponce Ruiz, Luis |url=http://revistacruce.com/politica-sociedad/cruce-y-cruz-entrevista-en-tres-partes-al-arq-cruz-garcia-parte-3.html |title=Cruce y Cruz: Entrevista en Tres Partes al Arq.

== Career==

After receiving a master's degree in Architecture from the [[University of Puerto Rico]], Cruz Garcia moved from Puerto Rico to Brussels, Belgium, where he founded WAI Architecture Think Tank with Nathalie Frankowski. Also during 2008, Cruz Garcia and Nathalie Frankowski started collaborating on the art collective [[Garcia Frankowski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alvarez, Paula|url= http://book-a.net/booka/islasformastexto/updates/60?lang=en|title=On Manifestos, form, criticism and autonomy: Interview with Garcia Frankowski|publisher=''Book-A.net''|date= 5 August 2013|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alvarez, Paula|url= http://arqa.com/actualidad/entrevistas/entrevista-a-garcia-frankowski-manifiestos-formas-critica-y-autonomia.html|title=Entrevista a Garcia Frankowski: Formas Critica y Autonomia|publisher=''Arqa''|date= 26 August 2013|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2009 both WAI and Garcia Frankowski operate mainly from Beijing making international publications, exhibitions, writings, and architectural projects from the Chinese capital.

Cruz Garcia is the co-editor-in-chief of What About It? an independent architecture and urbanism magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cormier, Brendan|url= http://popupcity.net/diy-publishing-an-interview-with-what-about-it/|title=DIY Publishing: An Interview with What About It?|publisher=''The Popup City''|date= 17 March 2011|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Cruz Garcia and Nathalie Frankowski designed and published the book Pure Hardcore Icons: A Manifesto on Pure Form in Architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A '''cumomer''' is a cumulative isotopomer and is a concept that relates to [[metabolic flux analysis]]. Specifically if we consider a molecule as a set of atoms, any of which could be ([[isotope|isotopically]]) labeled, the cumomers are a set of [[isotopomers]] with particular positions of 13C-labels grouped into different levels depending on the amount of labeled atoms.
At level 0, any position can be either 12C or 13C, at level 1 one position is 13C whether the others may or may not be labeled and so on.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25193">'''Fault detection, isolation, and recovery''' ('''FDIR''') is a subfield of [[control engineering]] which concerns itself with monitoring a system, identifying when a [[Fault (technology)|fault]] has occurred, and pinpointing the type of fault and its location.  Two approaches can be distinguished: A direct pattern recognition of sensor readings that indicate a fault and an analysis of the discrepancy between the sensor readings and expected values, derived from some model.  In the latter case, it is typical that a fault is said to be detected if the discrepancy or ''residual'' goes above a certain threshold.  It is then the task of fault isolation to categorize the type of fault and its location in the machinery.  '''Fault detection and isolation''' ('''FDI''') techniques can be broadly classified into two categories.  These include model-based FDI and signal processing based FDI.

== Model-based  ==

[[File:Fault Detection Aircraft.png|thumb|400px|right|Example of model-based FDI logic for an actuator in an aircraft elevator control system&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathworks.com/mason/tag/proxy.html?dataid=6801 Jason R. Ghidella and Pieter J. Mosterman, "Requirements-Based Testing in Aircraft Control Design," Paper ID AIAA 2005-5886 in AIAA Modeling and Simulations Technologies Conference and Exhibit 2005, August 15-18, San Francisco, California, 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In model-based FDI techniques some model of the system is used to decide about the occurrence of fault. The system model may be [[mathematical model|mathematical]] or knowledge based. Some of the model-based FDI techniques include&lt;ref&gt;Ding, S.X., Model-based fault diagnosis techniques, Springer 2008&lt;/ref&gt; observer-based approach, parity-space approach, and parameter identification based methods. There is another trend of model-based FDI schemes, which is called set-membership methods. These methods guarantee the detection of fault under certain conditions. The main difference is that instead of finding the most likely model, these techniques omit the models, which are not compatible with data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S240589631502443X | doi=10.1016/j.ifacol.2015.11.185 | volume=48 | issue=27 | title=Model Invalidation for Switched Affine Systems with Applications to Fault and Anomaly Detection**This work is supported in part by DARPA grant N66001-14-1-4045. | year=2015 | journal=IFAC-PapersOnLine | pages=260–266 | last1 = Harirchi | first1 = Farshad | last2 = Ozay | first2 = Necmiye}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05921 Farshad Harirchi and Necmiye Ozay, "Guaranteed Model-Based Fault Detection in Cyber-Physical Systems: A Model Invalidation Approach" , arXiv]&lt;/ref&gt;

The example shown in the figure on the right illustrates a model-based FDI technique for an aircraft elevator reactive controller through the use of a truth table and a state chart.  The truth table defines how the controller reacts to detected faults, and the state chart defines how the controller switches between the different modes of operation (passive, active, standby, off, and isolated) of each actuator.  For example, if a fault is detected in hydraulic system 1, then the truth table sends an event to the state chart that the left inner actuator should be turned off.  One of the benefits of this model-based FDI technique is that this reactive controller can also be connected to a continuous-time model of the actuator hydraulics, allowing the study of switching transients.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathworks.com/mason/tag/proxy.html?dataid=5505 Pieter J.

== Signal processing based FDI  ==
In signal processing based FDI, some mathematical or statistical operations are performed on the measurements, or some neural network is trained using measurements to extract the information about the fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title=Shannon wavelet spectrum analysis on truncated vibration signals for machine incipient fault detection| journal=Measurement Science and Technology| year=2012 | last=Liu | volume=23 | issue=5 | pages=1–11 | first1=Jie | doi=10.1088/0957-0233/23/5/055604}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmadimanesh, Alireza, and S.

A good example of signal processing based FDI is [[time domain reflectometry]] where a signal is sent down a cable or electrical line and the reflected signal is compared mathematically to original signal to identify faults.  Spread Spectrum Time Domain Reflectometry, for instance, involves sending down a spread spectrum signal down a wire line to detect wire faults.&lt;ref&gt;Furse,Cynthia; Smith, Paul; Lo, Chet.

==Machine fault diagnosis==

Machine fault diagnosis is a field of [[mechanical engineering]] concerned with finding faults arising in machines. A particularly well developed part of it applies specifically to rotating machinery, one of the most common types encountered. To identify the most probable faults leading to failure, many methods are used for data collection, including [[vibration]] monitoring, [[thermal imaging]], oil particle analysis, etc. Then these data are processed utilizing methods like [[frequency spectrum#Spectrum analysis|spectral analysis]], [[wavelet analysis]], wavelet transform, short term Fourier transform, Gabor Expansion, Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), cepstrum, bispectrum, correlation method, high resolution spectral analysis, waveform analysis (in the time domain, because spectral analysis usually concerns only frequency distribution and not phase information) and others. The results of this analysis are used in a root cause failure analysis in order to determine the original cause of the fault. For example, if a bearing fault is diagnosed, then it is likely that the bearing was not itself damaged at installation, but rather as the consequence of another installation error (e.g., misalignment) which then led to bearing damage. Diagnosing the bearing's damaged state is not enough for precision maintenance purposes. The root cause needs to be identified and remedied. If this is not done, the replacement bearing will soon wear out for the same reason and the machine will suffer more damage, remaining dangerous. Of course, the cause may also be visible as a result of the spectral analysis undertaken at the data-collection stage, but this may not always be the case.

The most common technique for detecting faults is the time-frequency analysis technique. For a rotating machine, the rotational speed of the machine (often known as the [[revolutions per minute|RPM]]), is not a constant, especially not during the start-up and shutdown stages of the machine. Even if the machine is running in the steady state, the rotational speed will vary around a steady-state mean value, and this variation depends on load and other factors. Since sound and vibration signals obtained from a rotating machine which are strongly related to its rotational speed, it can be said that they are time-variant signals in nature. These time-variant features carry the machine fault signatures. Consequently, how these features are extracted and interpreted is important to research and industrial applications.

The most common method used in signal analysis is the [[FFT]], or Fourier transform. The Fourier transform and its inverse counterpart offer two perspectives to study a signal: via the time domain or via the frequency domain. The [[FFT]]-based spectrum of a time signal shows us the existence of its frequency contents. By studying these and their magnitude or phase relations, we can obtain various types of information, such as [[harmonics]], [[sidebands]], [[beating frequency|beat frequency]], bearing fault frequency and so on. However, the [[FFT]] is only suitable for signals whose frequency contents do not change over time; however, as mentioned above, the frequency contents of the sound and vibration signals obtained from a rotating machine are very much time-dependent. For this reason, [[FFT]]-based spectra are unable to detect how the frequency contents develop over time. To be more specific, if the [[revolutions per minute|RPM]] of a machine is increasing or decreasing during its startup or shutdown period, its bandwidth in the FFT spectrum will become much wider than it would be simply for the steady state. Hence, in such a case, the harmonics are not so distinguishable in the spectrum.

The time frequency approach for machine fault diagnosis can be divided into two broad categories: linear methods and the quadratic methods. The difference is that linear transforms can be inverted to construct the time signal, thus, they are more suitable for signal processing, such as noise reduction and time-varying filtering. Although the quadratic method describes the energy distribution of a signal in the joint time frequency domain, which is useful for analysis, classification, and detection of signal features, phase information is lost in the quadratic time-frequency representation; also, the time histories cannot be reconstructed with this method.

The short-term Fourier transform ([[STFT]]) and the [[Gabor transform]] are two algorithms commonly used as linear time-frequency methods. If we consider linear time-frequency analysis to be the evolution of the conventional [[FFT]], then quadratic time frequency analysis would be the power spectrum counterpart. Quadratic algorithms include the Gabor spectrogram, Cohen's class and the adaptive spectrogram. The main advantage of time frequency analysis is discovering the patterns of frequency changes, which usually represent the nature of the signal. As long as this pattern is identified the machine fault associated with this pattern can be identified. Another important use of time frequency analysis is the ability to filter out a particular frequency component using a time-varying filter.

==Robust fault diagnosis==
In practice, model uncertainties and measurement noise can complicate fault detection and isolation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7040291/  "Robust residual selection for fault detection", 2014.]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, using fault diagnostics to meet industrial needs in a cost-effective way, and to reduce maintenance costs without requiring more investments than the cost of what is to be avoided in the first place, requires an effective scheme of applying them. This is the subject of [[maintenance, repair and operations]]; the different strategies include:
*[[Condition-based maintenance]]
*[[Planned maintenance|Planned preventive maintenance]]
*[[Preventive maintenance]]
*[[Corrective maintenance]] (does not use diagnostics)
*[[Integrated vehicle health management]]

===Machine learning techniques for fault detection and diagnosis===
{{See also|Machine learning}}
In fault detection and diagnosis, [[Statistical classification|mathematical classification models]] which in fact belong to [[supervised learning]] methods, are trained on the [[training set]] of a labeled [[dataset]] to accurately identify the redundancies, faults and anomalous samples. During the past decades, there are different [[Statistical classification|classification]] and [[Data pre-processing|preprocessing]] models that have been developed and proposed in this research area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chen |first1=Kunjin |last2=Huang |first2=Caowei |last3=He |first3=Jinliang |title=Fault detection, classification and location for transmission lines and distribution systems: a review on the methods |journal=High Voltage |date=1 April 2016 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=25–33 |doi=10.1049/hve.2016.0005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|''K''-nearest-neighbors algorithm]] (''k''NN) is one of the oldest techniques which has been used to solve fault detection and diagnosis problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Verdier |first1=Ghislain |last2=Ferreira |first2=Ariane |title=Adaptive Mahalanobis Distance and $k$-Nearest Neighbor Rule for Fault Detection in Semiconductor Manufacturing |journal=IEEE Transactions on Semiconductor Manufacturing |date=February 2011 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=59–68 |doi=10.1109/TSM.2010.2065531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the simple logic that this instance-based algorithm has, there are some problems with large [[dimensionality]] and processing time when it is used on large [[dataset]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tian |first1=Jing |last2=Morillo |first2=Carlos |last3=Azarian |first3=Michael H. |last4=Pecht |first4=Michael |title=Motor Bearing Fault Detection Using Spectral Kurtosis-Based Feature Extraction Coupled With K-Nearest Neighbor Distance Analysis |journal=IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics |date=March 2016 |volume=63 |issue=3 |pages=1793–1803 |doi=10.1109/TIE.2015.2509913}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|''k''NN]] is not able to automatically extract the features to overcome the [[curse of dimensionality]], so often some [[Data pre-processing|data preprocessing]] techniques like [[Principal component analysis]](PCA), [[Linear discriminant analysis]](LDA) or [[Canonical correlation|Canonical correlation analysis]](CCA) accompany it to reach a better performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Safizadeh |first1=M.S. |last2=Latifi |first2=S.K. |title=Using multi-sensor data fusion for vibration fault diagnosis of rolling element bearings by accelerometer and load cell |journal=Information Fusion |date=July 2014 |volume=18 |pages=1–8 |doi=10.1016/j.inffus.2013.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many industrial cases, the effectiveness of [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|''k''NN]] has been compared with other methods, specially with more complex classification models such as [[Support Vector Machine]]s (SVMs), which is widely used in this field. Thanks to their appropriate nonlinear mapping using [[kernel methods]], SVMs have an impressive performance in generalization, even with small training data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Jie |last2=Zio |first2=Enrico |title=Feature vector regression with efficient hyperparameters tuning and geometric interpretation |journal=Neurocomputing |date=December 2016 |volume=218 |pages=411–422 |doi=10.1016/j.neucom.2016.08.093}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, general SVMs do not have automatic feature extraction themselves and just like [[k-nearest neighbors algorithm|''k''NN]], are often coupled with a [[data pre-processing]] technique.&lt;ref name="ruonan"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Liu |first1=Ruonan |last2=Yang |first2=Boyuan |last3=Zio |first3=Enrico |last4=Chen |first4=Xuefeng |title=Artificial intelligence for fault diagnosis of rotating machinery: A review |journal=Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing |date=August 2018 |volume=108 |pages=33–47 |doi=10.1016/j.ymssp.2018.02.016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another drawback of SVMs is that their performance is highly sensitive to the initial parameters, particularly to the [[kernel method]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Genton |first1=Marc G. |title=Classes of Kernels for Machine Learning: A Statistics Perspective |journal=Journal of Machine Learning Research |date=2001 |volume=2 |pages=299–312 |doi=10.1162/15324430260185646}}&lt;/ref&gt;, so in each signal [[dataset]], a parameter tuning process is required to be conducted first. Therefore, the low speed of the training phase is a limitation of SVMs when it comes to its usage in fault detection and diagnosis cases.&lt;ref name="kot"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kotsiantis |first1=S.B. |last2=Zaharakis |first2=I.D. |last3=Pintelas |first3=P.E. |title=Machine learning: a review of classification and combining techniques |journal=Artificial Intelligence Review |date=2006 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=159–190 |doi=10.1007/s10462-007-9052-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Time domain waveform and CWTS of a normal signal comparison.png|thumb|Time domain waveform(top) and CWTS(bottom) of a normal signal]]
[[Artificial Neural Networks]](ANNs) are among the most mature and widely used [[Statistical classification|mathematical classification algorithms]] in fault detection and diagnosis. ANNs are well-known for their efficient self-learning capabilities of the complex relations (which generally exist inherently in fault detection and diagnosis problems) and are easy to operate.&lt;ref name="ruonan"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Another advantage of ANNs is that they perform automatic feature extraction by allocating negligible weights to the irrelevant features, helping the system to avoid dealing with another feature extractor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vercellis |first1=Carlo |title=Business intelligence : data mining and optimization for decision making |date=2008 |publisher=Wiley |location=Hoboken, N.J. |isbn=978-0-470-51138-1 |pages=436 |edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ANNs tend to [[overfitting|over-fit]] the training set, which will have consequences of having poor validation accuracy on the validation set. Hence, often, some regularization terms and prior knowledge are added to the ANN model to avoid [[overfitting|over-fiting]] and achieve higher performance. Moreover, properly determining the size of the hidden layer needs an exhaustive parameter tuning, to avoid poor approximation and generalization capabilities.&lt;ref name="kot"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In general, different SVMs and ANNs models (i.e. [[Backpropagation|Back-Propagation Neural Networks]] and [[Multilayer perceptron|Multi-Layer Perceptron]]) have shown successful performances in the fault detection and diagnosis in industries such as [[gearbox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Saravanan |first1=N. |last2=Siddabattuni |first2=V.N.S.

===Deep learning techniques for fault detection and diagnosis===
[[File:Typical cnn.png|thumb|Typical architecture of a Convolutional Neural Networks]]
{{See also|Deep learning}}
With the research advances in ANNs and the advent of [[deep learning]] algorithms using deep and complex layers, novel [[Statistical classification|classification models]] have been developed to cope with fault detection and diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lv |first1=Feiya |last2=Wen |first2=Chenglin |last3=Bao |first3=Zejing |last4=Liu |first4=Meiqin |title=Fault diagnosis based on deep learning |journal=2016 American Control Conference (ACC) |date=July 2016 |pages=6851–6856 |doi=10.1109/ACC.2016.7526751|isbn=978-1-4673-8682-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the [[machine learning|shallow learning]] models extract a few feature values from signals, causing a [[dimensionality]] reduction from the original [[signal]]. By using [[Convolutional neural network]]s, the [[continuous wavelet transform]] [[scalogram]] can be directly classified to normal and faulty classes.

'''Fauvism''' is the style of '''''les Fauves''''' ([[French language|French]] for "the wild beasts"), a group of early twentieth-century [[modern art]]ists whose works emphasized [[painterly]] qualities and strong color over the [[Representation (arts)|representational]] or [[Realism (visual arts)|realistic]] values retained by [[Impressionism]]. While Fauvism as a style began around 1904 and continued beyond 1910, the [[Art movement|movement]] as such lasted only a few years, 1905–1908, and had three exhibitions.&lt;ref name=elderfield13&gt;[[John Elderfield]],  The ''"Wild Beasts" Fauvism and Its Affinities,'' 1976, [[Museum of Modern Art]], p.13, {{ISBN|0-87070-638-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Judi, et al., ''The Fauve Landscape'', 1990, Abbeville Press, p. 13, {{ISBN|1-55859-025-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The leaders of the movement were [[André Derain]] and [[Henri Matisse]].

Besides Matisse and [[André Derain|Derain]], other artists included [[Albert Marquet]], [[Charles Camoin]], [[Louis Valtat]], [[Jean Puy]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Henri Manguin]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Othon Friesz]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Kees van Dongen]] and [[Georges Braque]] (subsequently Picasso's partner in [[Cubism]]).&lt;ref name=elderfield13/&gt;

The paintings of the Fauves were characterized by seemingly wild brush work and strident colors, while their subject matter had a high degree of simplification and [[Abstract art|abstraction]].&lt;ref name=tate-fauvism&gt;Tate (2007).

Other key influences were [[Paul Cézanne]]&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, 1990, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Gauguin]], whose employment of areas of saturated color—notably in paintings from Tahiti—strongly influenced Derain's work at [[Collioure]] in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;Teitel, Alexandra J.

"How do you see these trees? They are yellow. So, put in yellow; this shadow, rather blue, paint it with pure [[ultramarine]]; these red leaves? Put in [[vermilion]]."
Fauvism has been compared to [[Expressionism]], both in its use of pure color and unconstrained brushwork.&lt;ref name=tate-fauvism/&gt; Some of the Fauves were among the first avant-garde artists to collect and study African and Oceanic art, alongside other forms of non-Western and folk art, leading several Fauves toward the development [[Cubism]].&lt;ref&gt;Joshua I. Cohen, "Fauve Masks: Rethinking Modern 'Primitivist' Uses of African and Oceanic Art, 1905-8." The Art Bulletin 99, no. 2 (June 2017): 136-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Derain CharingCrossBridge.png|thumb|[[André Derain]], 1906, ''Charing Cross Bridge, London'', [[National Gallery of Art]], Washington, DC.]]
[[Gustave Moreau]] was the movement's inspirational teacher;&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Freeman, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; a controversial professor at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in Paris and a [[Symbolist painters|Symbolist painter]], he taught Matisse, Marquet, Manguin, Rouault and Camoin during the 1890s, and was viewed by critics as the group's philosophical leader until Matisse was recognized as such in 1904.&lt;ref name="Freeman" /&gt; Moreau's broad-mindedness, originality and affirmation of the expressive potency of pure color was inspirational for his students.&lt;ref name=dempsey&gt;Dempsey, Amy (2002). ''Styles, Schools and Movements: An Encyclopedic Guide to Modern Art'', pp. 66-69, London: Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; Matisse said of him, "He did not set us on the right roads, but off the roads.  He disturbed our complacency."&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt; This source of empathy was taken away with Moreau's death in 1898, but the artists discovered other catalysts for their development.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt;

In 1896, Matisse, then an unknown art student, visited the artist [[John Peter Russell]] on the island of [[Belle Île]] off the coast of [[Brittany]].&lt;ref name=abc&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/booktalk/stories/s1430343.htm "Book talk: The Unknown Matisse..."], [[Radio National|ABC Radio National]], interview with [[Hilary Spurling]], 8 June 2005. Retrieved 1 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell was an [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] painter; Matisse had never previously seen an Impressionist work directly, and was so shocked at the style that he left after ten days, saying, "I couldn't stand it any more."&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; The next year he returned as Russell's student and abandoned his earth-colored palette for bright Impressionist colors, later stating, "Russell was my teacher, and Russell explained color theory to me."&lt;ref name=abc/&gt; Russell had been a close friend of [[Vincent van Gogh]] and gave Matisse a Van Gogh drawing.&lt;ref name=abc/&gt;

In 1901, [[Maurice de Vlaminck]] encountered the work of [[Vincent van Gogh|Van Gogh]] for the first time at an exhibition, declaring soon after that he loved Van Gogh more than his own father; he started to work by squeezing paint directly onto the canvas from the tube.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt; In parallel with the artists' discovery of contemporary avant-garde art came an appreciation of pre-[[Renaissance]] French art, which was shown in a 1904 exhibition, ''French Primitives''.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt; Another aesthetic influence was African sculpture, of which [[Vlaminck]], [[Derain]] and Matisse were early collectors.&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt;

Many of the Fauve characteristics first cohered in [[Matisse]]'s painting, ''[[Luxe, Calme et Volupté]]'' ("Luxury, Calm and Pleasure"), which he painted in the summer of 1904, whilst in [[Saint-Tropez]] with [[Paul Signac]] and [[Henri-Edmond Cross]].&lt;ref name=dempsey/&gt;

After viewing the boldly colored canvases of [[Henri Matisse]], [[André Derain]], [[Albert Marquet]], [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Kees van Dongen]], [[Charles Camoin]], and [[Jean Puy]] at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1905, the critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] disparaged the painters as "''fauves''" (wild beasts), thus giving their movement the name by which it became known, ''Fauvism''. The artists shared their first exhibition at the 1905 Salon d'Automne. The group gained their name after [[Louis Vauxcelles|Vauxcelles]] described their show of work with the phrase "[[Donatello]] chez les fauves" ("Donatello among the wild beasts"), contrasting their "orgie of tones" with a [[Renaissance]]-style sculpture that shared the room with them.&lt;ref name="Gil Blas, 17 October 1905"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k7522165g/f5.image Louis Vauxcelles, ''Le Salon d'Automne'', Gil Blas, 17 October 1905.

[[Henri Rousseau]] was not a Fauve, but his large jungle scene ''[[The Hungry Lion Throws Itself on the Antelope]]'' was exhibited near Matisse's work and may have had an influence on the pejorative used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roberta Smith|Smith, Roberta]] (2006).

Following the Salon d'Automne of 1905 which marked the beginning of Fauvism, the Salon des Indépendants of 1906 marked the first time all the Fauves would exhibit together. The centerpiece of the exhibition was Matisse's monumental ''[[Le Bonheur de Vivre]] (The Joy of Life)''.&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt; Critics were horrified by the flatness, bright colors, eclectic style and mixed technique of ''Le Bonheur de Vivre''.&lt;ref name="Clement"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VcaMyvjUZhIC&amp;pg=PR23&amp;lpg=PR23&amp;dq=salle+VII,+salon+d'automne+de+1905&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=alVRJahAml&amp;sig=6SkzgOftNxhpsdYdDNKbJjzqXUY&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=metzinger&amp;f=false Russell T.

At the same exhibition Paul Cézanne was represented by ten works. He wouldn't live long enough to see the end of the show. Cézanne died 22 October 1906 (aged 67). His works included ''Maison dans les arbres'' (no. 323), ''Portrait de Femme'' (no. 235) and ''Le Chemin tournant'' (no. 326). Van Dongen showed three works, ''Montmartre'' (492), ''Mademoiselle Léda'' (493) and ''Parisienne'' (494). [[André Derain]] exhibited 8 works, ''Westminster-Londres'' (438), ''Arbres dans un chemin creux'' (444) along with 5 works painted at [[l'Estaque]].&lt;ref name="Salon 1906" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt; Camoin entered 5 works, Dufy 7, Friesz 4, Manguin 6, Marquet 8, Puy 10, Valtat 10, and Vlaminck was represented by 7 works.&lt;ref name="Salon 1906" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23157">A '''fire regime''' is the pattern, frequency, and intensity of the [[bushfire]]s and [[wildfire]]s that prevail in an area over long periods of time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pyne|first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen J.

A fire regime describes the spatial and temporal patterns and ecosystem impacts of fire on the landscape, and provides an integrative approach to identifying the impacts of fire at an ecosystem or landscape level.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Morgan, Penelope; Hardy; Swetnam; Rollins; Long (1999).

''[[International Journal of Wildland Fire]]''. '''10''': 329–342 – via [[Google Scholar]].&lt;/ref&gt; If fires are too frequent, plants may be killed before they have matured, or before they have set sufficient seed to ensure population recovery. If fires are too infrequent, plants may mature, [[Senescence|senesce]], and die without ever releasing their seed.

Fire regimes can change with the spatial and temporal variations in topography, climate, and fuel. Understanding the historic fire regime is important for understanding and predicting future fire regime changes and the interactions between fire and climates.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Characteristics ==
[[File:Wildland Fire in Ecosystems 15-1-2.png|thumb|370x370px|Fire regime classification by ecosystem type. Fire severity and frequency is linked to vegetation type.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wildland Fire in Ecosystems: Effects of Fire on Flora. Gen. Tech. Rep. RMRS-GTR-42-vol. 2.|last=Brown|first=James K.|last2=Smith|first2=Jane Kapler|publisher=Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Fire regimes are characterized by a variety of factors including vegetation composition, fuel structure, [[climate]] and [[weather]] patterns, and [[topography]]. Because fire regimes are highly dependent on the landscape and ecosystem in which they occur, there is no standard classification for fire regimes. However, characteristics such as those described below are commonly used to characterize fire regimes on a broad scale.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Other factors such as post-disturbance successional stages and types of previous management on the landscape may also be used to describe a fire regime's characteristics. Climate directly impacts the frequency, size, and severity of fires, while also affecting the vegetation structure and composition. Fire regimes are also impacted by topography, slope exposure, landscape management, and ignition (which may be human or lightning-caused).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Taylor | first1 = Alan H. | last2 = Skinner | first2 = Carl N. | year = 2003 | title = Spatial Patterns and Controls on Historical Fire Regimes and Forest Structure in the Klamath Mountains | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/1051-0761(2003)013%5b0704:SPACOH%5d2.0.CO;2/abstract | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 704–719 | doi = 10.1890/1051-0761(2003)013[0704:spacoh]2.0.co;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although characteristics of fire regimes can vary based on regional differences, at a minimum fire regimes are characterized based on an assessment of the impacts on the vegetation ('''severity''') and when and how often fires occur in a given landscape (expressed as '''fire interval''' and '''fire rotation'''). Fire severity is the impact of fire on the [[ecosystem]], which may include the degree of vegetative mortality, the depth of burn, or other factors which may be site specific.  The fire interval is the number of years between fires and is highly dependent on spatial scales. Fire rotation is a measure of the amount of fire in a landscape (the amount of time required to burn an area the size of the study area). The fire rotation statistic is best used for large areas that have mapped historic fire events.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, William (2009). ''Fire Ecology in Rocky Mountain Landscapes''. Island Press. pp. 131–163. {{ISBN|978-1597261838}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other fire regime classifications may incorporate fire type (such as ground fires, surface fires, and crown fires), fire size, fire intensity, seasonality, and degree of variability within fire regimes. Ground fires use glowing [[combustion]] to burn [[organic matter]] in the soil. Surface fires burn leaf litter, fallen branches, and ground plants. Crown fires burn through to the top layer of tree foliage.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nps.gov/fire/wildland-fire/learning-center/fire-in-depth/fire-spread.cfm "Fire Spread"]. ''nps.gov''. National Park Service. Retrieved 23 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Fire-line intensity is the energy released per unit of measurement per unit of time and is usually a description of flaming combustion.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Seasonality is the period of time during the year that the fuels of a specific ecosystem can ignite.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brooks et al.|first=Matthew|date=2004|title=Effects of invasive alien plants on fire regimes|journal=[[BioScience]]|volume=54.7|pages=677–688|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0677:eoiapo]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spatial and temporal scales ==
Fire regimes can be characterized by a wide variety of spatial and temporal scales which may range from highly site-specific to regional scales and from a few years to thousands of years. Understanding the variability of the fire regime across these scales is crucial to understanding current and future fire regimes. Distinctions should be made between "fire history" and "historic fire regimes". Fire history is a more general term that measures the frequency of fires in a landscape. It may not always be possible to describe the type or severity of these past fire events depending on data availability. Historic fire regimes describe the characteristics of fires across a landscape and the relationship and interactions between ecosystem structure and processes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
[[File:LANDFIRE's Fire Regime Group Map.jpg|thumb|320x320px|[https://www.landfire.gov/ LANDFIRE] (Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools), is a collaborative program between the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of the Interior that provides geospatial data on fire regime characteristics such as vegetation, habitat, carbon sources/sinks, fire, etc. The data is used to help map fire events and look at broad scale fire regime effects.]]

== Mapping ==
Recent fire history can be recorded on fire maps and atlases, often using [[remote sensing]]. The [http://cwfis.cfs.nrcan.gc.ca/ha/nfdb Canadian National Fire Database] is a record of large fire events since 1980, is the first nationwide database of its kind. It includes point locations of all fires larger than 200&amp;nbsp;ha from 1959–1999. The United States has the [https://mtbs.gov/ Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) Project] which uses satellite data to map fires from 1984 onward. MTBS maps fire severity within the areas burned and provides a standard on fire perimeters and severity for all fires within the U.S. Applications for projects such as these are used in modeling interactions between fire climate and vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rollins|first=Matthew G.|last2=Keane|first2=Robert E.|last3=Parsons|first3=Russell A.|date=2004|title=Mapping fuels and fire regimes using remote sensing, ecosystem simulation, and gradient modeling|url=|journal=Ecological Applications|volume=14|issue=|pages=75–95|via=|doi=10.1890/02-5145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Landscape Fire and Resource Management Planning Tools (LANDFIRE) classification is another example of a mapping and modeling system used in the U.S. that collects and analyzes vegetative, fire, and fuel characteristics of fire regimes across a variety of landscapes. LANDFIRE is unique in that it uses both historic fire regimes and current fire regimes to analyze differences between past and present characteristics. It describes fire regimes based on their fire frequencies and severities which helps detect changes in fire regimes over time which is helpful in assessing fire climate effects at regional and landscape scales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.landfire.gov/index.php "LANDFIRE Program: Home"]. ''www.landfire.gov''. Retrieved 2017-11-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aging past fire events ==
{{See also|Fire history}}
Understanding historic fire regimes can be difficult, as fire history data is not always reliable or available. Past fire events can be identified using fire scar analysis on trees, age distributions of stands, charcoal samples, or vegetation changes seen over long periods of time. Examining past fire events and historic fire regimes provides a means of examining trends in vegetation and fire-climate interactions over a long time frame. The variability and fire-climate-vegetation interactions of fire regimes are able to be examined in greater detail and over much longer time periods (thousands of years) rather than just decades as provided by examining historical fire records. Studies have found strong correlations between past climate and fire frequency and extent using these historical fire aging methods.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Whitlock, Cathy; Higuera; McWethy; Briles (2010). [http://www.wildfirepire.org/sites/default/files/whitlock_2010_paleoecological_perspectives_on_fire_ecology_revisiting_the_fire_regime_concept.pdf "Paleoecological Perspectives on Fire Ecology: Revisiting the Fire-Regime Concept"] (PDF). ''The Open Ecology Journal''. '''3''': 6–23 – via Google Scholar.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although fire history data is useful for understanding past fire regimes, changes in fire management, climate, and vegetation do not allow the continuation of the same fire regimes into the future. Models that examine past fire-climate relationships are the best predictors of future fire regime changes.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== Effects of an altered fire regime ==
[[Biota (ecology)|Biota]] that are able to survive and adapt to their particular fire regimes can receive significant benefits: the ability to regrow stronger, greater protection against fire and disease, or new space to grow in formerly occupied locations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As a fire regime changes, species may begin to suffer.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Enright|first=Neal J.|last2=Fontaine|first2=Joseph B.|last3=Lamont|first3=Byron B.|last4=Miller|first4=Ben P.|last5=Westcott|first5=Vanessa C.|date=2014-11-01|title=Resistance and resilience to changing climate and fire regime depend on plant functional traits|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2745.12306/abstract|journal=Journal of Ecology|language=en|volume=102|issue=6|pages=1572–1581|doi=10.1111/1365-2745.12306|issn=1365-2745}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decreasing fire intervals negatively affect the ability of fire-killed species to recover to pre-disturbance levels, leading to longer recovery times. Some species, such as [[resprouter]]s, are better able to withstand changing fire regimes compared to obligate seeders. However, many fire-killed species may be unable to recover if shortened fire intervals persist over time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Lengthened fire intervals will negatively affect [[Fire adaptations|fire-adapted species]], some of which depend upon fire for reproduction. In fire-adapted plant communities with stand-replacing crown fires, recruitment occurs in the first year following a fire event.

=== Climate change ===
[[File:Satellite Image of Earth's Interrelated Systems and Climate - GPN-2002-000121.jpg|thumb|306x306px|NASA imagery showing the interrelatedness of climate and fire. Active fires are represented by red dots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=NASA|title=English: Satellite data and images such as those presented in this image of Earth give scientists a more comprehensive view of the Earth's interrelated systems and climate.

[[Climate change]] has affected fire regimes globally, with models projecting higher fire frequencies and reduced plant growth as a result of warmer, drier climates. This is predicted to affect fire-intolerant woody species in particular by reducing plant recruitment, growth, and survival, which shortens the fire intervals within these landscapes causing plant extirpation or extinction. A recent model identifying the impacts of climate change and altered fire regimes and plant communities predicts that woody plant extinctions will increase, causing changes in ecosystem structure, composition, and carbon storage. The fire-climate interactions of a changing climate are predicted to reduce population recovery for plants solely dependent on seed production for re-population. As climates shift to warmer and drier, seedling recruitment may become poor or non-existent. This post-fire recruitment shift means that a decrease in precipitation causes an increase in dry or drought-prone years which causes a decrease in seed recruitment probability. This reduced seed recruitment also is exacerbated by increased fire severity.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Enright | first1 = Neal J | last2 = Fontaine | first2 = Joseph B | last3 = Bowman | first3 = David MJS | last4 = Bradstock | first4 = Ross A | last5 = Williams | first5 = Richard J | year = 2015 | title = Interval squeeze: altered fire regimes and demographic responses interact to threaten woody species persistence as climate changes | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/140231/abstract | journal = Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment | volume = 13 | issue = 5| pages = 265–272 | doi = 10.1890/140231 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warmer climates are projected to increase fire activity and lengthen fire seasons globally. The annual number of extreme fire weather days is projected to increase as increasing temperatures, reduced relative humidity, increased wind speeds, and increased dry fuel loads result in higher fire intensities and severity. These changes will shorten fire intervals, which will reduce the time for plants to accumulate seeds and potentially allowing for selection of more flammable species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = D'Antonio | first1 = Carla M. | last2 = Vitousek | first2 = Peter M. | year = 1992 | title = Biological Invasions by Exotic Grasses, the Grass/Fire Cycle, and Global Change | url = http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev.es.23.110192.000431 | journal = Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume = 23 | issue = 1| pages = 63–87 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.es.23.110192.000431 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of these fire interval shifts have been studied globally. A study in southeast Australia found that widespread losses of mountain ash following prolonged wildfire seasons have burned 87% of the species range. Subsequent re-burns of immature mountain ash led to complete regeneration failure and conversion of forest cover to shrubs and grasslands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bowman | first1 = David M. J. S. | last2 = Murphy | first2 = Brett P. | last3 = Neyland | first3 = Dominic L.

These climatic shifts in conjunction with increased fire frequency and shorter fire intervals are causing vegetative communities to shift their rates of growth, reproduction, and reduce post-disturbance recruitment rates.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Examples ==

Bushfire is especially important in [[Australia]], where much of the vegetation has evolved in the presence of regular fires caused by the [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] practice of [[firestick farming]]. As result, components of the vegetation are adapted to and dependent upon a particular fire regime. Disruption of that fire regime can affect their survival. An example of fire regime dependent species is the ''[[Banksia]]'' species  which is both fire-sensitive and [[serotinous]]. In Banksia species, fire also triggers the release of seed, ensuring population recovery. In an ideal fire regime, a plant would need to have sufficient time to mature and build an adequately large bank of seed before the next fire kills it and triggers seed release.

The [[California chaparral and woodlands]] [[ecoregion]], covering a large portion of the [[U.S. state]], is dependent on periodic natural wildfires for optimal health and renewal.&lt;sup&gt;[[Fire regime#cite note-3|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt; A study showed that the increasing [[rural-urban fringe]] interface and [[wildfire suppression]] practices of the last century have resulted in an increased vulnerability to less frequent, more severe wildfires.  The study claimed fire suppression increased fuel in coniferous forests. &lt;sup&gt;[[Fire regime#cite note-:2-4|[4]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Upon analysis of California Statewide Fire History Database from 1910–1999, it was actually found that fire frequency and the area burned have not declined, furthermore, fire size has not increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keeley | first1 = Jon E. | last2 = Fotheringham | first2 = C. J. | last3 = Morais | first3 = Marco | year = 1999 | title = Reexamining fire suppression impacts on brushland fire regimes | url = | journal = Science | volume = 284 | issue = 5421| pages = 1829–1832 | doi=10.1126/science.284.5421.1829}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaparral fire suppression, unlike fire suppression in coniferous forests, has not affected the natural fire regime, according to a study conducted by the [[United States Geological Survey]].

== Invasive species effects ==
=== Cheatgrass ===
One example of an invasive species that changed fire regime in Western North America is [[cheat grass|Bromus tectorum]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Whisenant SG. 1990. Changing Fire Frequencies on Idaho's Snake River Plains: Ecological and Management Implications. Logan (UT): US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Intermountain Research Center. General Technical Report INT-276.&lt;/ref&gt; Historical fire return intervals in the Snake River Plain sagebrush was 60–110 years, but currently, due to the presence of cheat grass, it burns every 5 years.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The cheat grass is a continuous source of fuel thus changing the fuel characteristics of the ecosystem. Frequent fire makes it difficult to impossible for native vegetation to fully recover.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Brazilian pepper tree ===
[[File:Schinus terebinthifolia, loof en vrugte, a, Pretoria.jpg|thumb|296x296px|Brazilian pepper trees are encroaching on native plant communities throughout the southeastern U.S. and causing changes to the frequency and severity of fire regimes and ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.landfire.gov/|title=LANDFIRE Program: Home|website=www.landfire.gov|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Another example of invasive species affecting fire regimes can be found with the spread of the [[Schinus terebinthifolius|Brazilian pepper tree]] (''Schinus terebinthifolia'') on native plant communities. Native to Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay, the plant was introduced as an ornamental species and has now established itself in areas well outside of its native range. Populations exist in Australia, South Africa, the Mediterranean, southern Asia, and the southeastern United States. Brazilian pepper is often found in disturbed soils and substrates and often outcompetes native plant communities creating [[monoculture]]-like conditions. South Florida near the [[Everglades National Park]] has particularly been affected by its spread, with some studies reporting only 7 species within (6) 100&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; plots. As Brazilian pepper moves into an area, it creates a sub-canopy layer that often outcompetes grasses and ground cover species. This changes the vegetative cover and densities of the landscape contributing a changed fire regime.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;[https://www.fs.fed.us/database/feis/plants/shrub/schter/all.html "Schinus terebinthifolius"]. ''www.fs.fed.us''. Retrieved 2017-11-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian peppers are fire-adapted and produce rapidly growing sprouts following fire events, although plant size and stand density are important in determining the post-fire response, with younger plants having higher mortality rates.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Fire frequency plays some role in Brazilian pepper establishment, with areas of frequent fires displaying lower abundances of the plant in contrast to areas not regularly burned. A recent model found that a 4-year fire-return interval would eradicate an initial 100 pepper female population within 25 years.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, Jens; Beckage, Brian (2009). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19645737 "Fire feedbacks facilitate invasion of pine savannas by Brazilian pepper (Schinus terebinthifolius)"]. ''New Phytologist''. '''184''': 365–375 – via PubMed.&lt;/ref&gt; In areas where Brazilian pepper occurs, fire regimes have been altered greatly due to fire exclusion and human settlement. Historically, these areas experienced frequent, low-severity fires. Brazilian pepper may create a shaded humid understory and reduce fine fuel loads in areas of historically frequent fire, which therefore increases the fire-return interval thus negatively affecting the fire-adapted plant community.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

'''''Freedom™''''', the sequel to '''''[[Daemon (novel series)|Daemon]]''''', is the second of a two-part novel, by the author [[Daniel Suarez (author)|Daniel Suarez]], about a distributed, persistent computer application, known as '''The Daemon''', that begins to change the real world after the original programmer's death.

==Plot==
The sequel picks up shortly after the end of ''Daemon''. Sobol's distributed AI has already infiltrated the computer systems of numerous companies and governments. Many companies have surrendered, either out of fear of annihilation or because they have been converted to the fairer and more efficient system. While the Daemon is a technological creation, much of the work is carried out by human beings, compelled by the Daemon to change the world, according to the vision of Matthew Sobol.

Connected by the "Darknet", the human followers, using Sobol's game engine (for his award-winning game "The Gate") as a base, have created their own ranking system and economy. Online identities mimic an [[Massively multiplayer online role-playing game|MMORPG]], with operatives doing tasks to gain levels and gaining access to new technologies and help from the Daemon in an effort to advance their communities. Numerous towns have slowly joined the Daemon's network as a means to improve their own situations and their society as a whole.

The rest of the world believes the Daemon is still a hoax, due to the efforts of the US government (and its allies) to appear to the general public that they are still in charge. In truth, the American political and economic system is collapsing, with the price of fuel and the unemployment rates both skyrocketing.

As with the first book, the interweaving stories follows specific characters:

'''Detective Sebeck''', now acting as an unwilling Daemon operative, has been sent on a "quest" by the avatar of the late Matthew Sobol, one in which will to determine the role of freedom to the human race. Using special glasses to see online Darknet items and threads, Sebeck is joined by a Daemon operative, Laney Price, and he soon learns that his quest is being monitored by the entire Darknet community.

Sebeck begins his quest meeting another operative named Riley, who introduces him to the newly growing Daemon communities, dubbed Holons, which are based on being self-sufficient, using natural energy sources and technologies, and avoiding the military-industrial complex opposed to the type of freedom that the Daemon communities want. Riley teaches Sebeck how to navigate the Darknet and to use it to his advantage. With Laney in tow, Sebeck journeys around the country, always witnessing important events in the history of the Daemon. Sebeck reunites with Jon in a town called Greely, Iowa.

It is one of several Midwestern towns chosen by the elite powers for invasion and destruction. Sebeck's Darknet quest thread returns, and he and Laney follow it through enemy lines, only to discover that it is a trap laid by the Major, who has developed a means of infiltrating the Daemon mainframe and make slight alterations. After being bound and interrogated by the Major, who offers to give him his former life back as a detective, husband, and father in return for his cooperation and information, Sebeck refuses. As he and Laney are taken to be executed via a wood chipper, Loki arrives with a pack of Razorbacks, killing their captors, and Moseley arrives to rescue him and Price. Reuniting with other Darknet faction members, Sebeck participates in the attack on the Sky Ranch that results in the destruction of the corporate monopoly and the Daemon research team.

After the fighting, Sebeck resumes his quest and travels with Laney, Jon Ross, and Natalie Phillips to Morgan's Point Cemetery in Texas. The 3D avatar of Mathew Sobol reveals his intentions and desires for a world in which all are equal. Having seen both sides and the war that followed Sebeck makes the choice that the Daemon is not a threat and allows the world now forming to exist. Then, Sebeck is rewarded with an online message from his son Chris, who forgives him for all that has happened, and Sebeck happily heads home to be reunited with his family.

'''Jon Ross''', fearing both the established authority and the actions of people like Loki, has joined the Daemon community to help shape it into a thing for good. He travels to China to recruit an old friend (and former spy) Shen Liang, but Liang refuses to believe that the Daemon network is real. Using Daemon technology that cloaks his image on CCTV cameras, Ross escapes before he can be taken into custody. Ross attempts to convince Natalie Phillips to join the Daemon community, but she rebuffs him. Ross then heads to Greely, meeting Hank Fossen, awaiting Sebeck's approach. The reunion is short-lived when they learn that Greely is surrounded by private security forces.

Ross joins several other townsfolk to defend Greely, but they are outnumbered and outmatched by the heavy weapons and armored fighting vehicles of the private security forces. They are almost killed, but the virtual Darknet avatar of Roy Merritt, a Level 200 champion, rescues them and defeats the private security forces with airborne laser drones after they refuse to surrender. Worried that Natalie will be in danger from Loki's machines during his impending attack on Sky Ranch, he travels there to give her a Darknet Amulet of Protection. After the battle is won, he and Natalie join Sebeck in the last leg of his quest, preparing for a life together.

At the funeral for Roy Merritt, '''NSA Agent Natalie Philips''' is approached by Loki who informs her that the Daemon operatives attending are there to honor his memory. Merritt has become a folk hero of the Darknet, known as "The Burning Man" by the Darknet users, who respect him for his tenacity. Loki tries to show her that she is working for the wrong side, but instead, she attempts to warn the authorities. Loki, in response, attacks a number of funeral attendants but only members of the private military contractor employed by the Major, Korr Security International.

Following the funeral, Phillips is made a scapegoat and relieved of her duties at the NSA. Ross attempts to convince her to join the Daemon community, but she refuses. Phillips has a plan to stop the government from taking control of the Daemon by destroying it. To that effect, Phillips allows herself to be recruited by the Major and a man named General Johnston. Flown to the Sky Ranch, the remaining base of operations for the ani-Daemon forces, Phillips is informed of their plan to seize control of the Daemon in a worldwide operation code, named Exorcist. After reading over a detailed report of Operation Exorcist, Phillips is highly suspicious of the relatively simple exploit in the Daemon's code that is described.

With the defeat of the General's offensive against the Daemon communities, Phillips is reunited with Ross, and together, they realize that Johnston's true plan is to allow most of the world's corporations to be destroyed by the Daemon (while protecting their own assets) and using the inevitable chaos to seize control of key facilities around the globe and declare a new world order with them in control. The General has no real use for Phillips other than to testify to the world the orthodox details of how the Daemon was supposedly defeated from the bogus report that she was given after the operation itself was over. However, they soon learn that Sobol had intentionally left fake errors in the Daemon's code and that the Daemon was many steps ahead of the private corporations, broadcasting their attempt to take over the world to the public and eliminating the personal wealth of everyone in charge. Declaring her love for Ross, together, they head off with Sebeck to witness him finish his quest and prepare for their future together.

'''Brian Gragg''' ("Loki Stormbringer") is the most powerful known human Daemon operative in existence, a Level 56 Sorcerer. Working with only his personal contingent of Razorbacks along with advanced weapons and armor, he scours America looking for the Major. Though he is well known, his rankings is low for his antisocial behavior and his rude, spiteful disposition. Heinrich Boerner, the 3D avatar of the Nazi soldier Gragg defeated to gain the attention of the Daemon in the first place, offers to become his ally because of Loki's extremely high power level, offering to commit any act or execute any order upon the conditions of the said order being met, including taking revenge for Loki if he were to be killed. Loki quickly accepts this offer.

Loki's first attempt to kill the Major fails when the Major escapes across water, where he is safe from Loki's machines, but eventually, Loki gains a lead that allows him to track the Major to a roadside motel. After using his Razorbacks, AutoM8s, and 'Angel Teeth' (guided spikes dropped from above) to kill the private security team guarding the Motel, he enters to find not the Major but an attractive girl, being held hostage. She claims that she is a low-level Daemon operative captured on a mission to deliver a valuable Darknet power ring. When Loki puts the ring on in an attempt to steal it, the ring injects Loki with a paralytic serum; he kills the girl with a blast of lightning before falling to the ground. Before falling unconscious, he sees several more men enter the room and destroy his Razorbacks, which he is unable to control, and he is finally captured by the Major.

Brought to a stable, Loki is stripped nude and tortured by the Major and removed from the Daemon's network. All biometric markers are cut off including his tongue, eyes and finger tips. However, it is later revealed that he was eventually rescued by the avatar of Boerner and implanted with cybernetic eyes, fingers, and a hypersonic speech module. He rescues Sebeck from being killed and then uses his Darknet power to dispatch an enormous army AutoM8's and Razorbacks to level Sky Ranch, hellbent on killing the Major.

After defeating the perimeter guard, his brutal assault on everyone at the Sky Ranch (including civilians) incurs the ire of the entire Daemon community. After being a large amount of negative ratings, the avatar of Roy Merritt arrives and attempts to reason with him to stop the killing, but when he refuses, Merritt uses his power to demote Loki to just level 10. Emotionally ruined and with all of his power taken away, Loki collapses, but his fellow Daemon members reach out to help him.

'''Hank Fossen''' is a third-generation farmer from Greely, who is recruited into the Daemon network by his daughter Jenna. Fighting a nuisance lawsuit against a company Halperin Organix, which has been illegally planting seeds on his property to create patent violations, Hank learns of Jenna's participation with a suspicious group in town. Jenna reveals the concept of the Daemon to Hank and promises that Halperin Organix's lawsuit will be dismissed now that they have gained "level 4 legal protection."

An assault on their farm, by hired mercenaries, is thwarted by Ross and other Daemon operatives, but upon learning about the impending assault on Greely, Hank sends Jenna and his wife to a predetermined shelter and then tries to help make a stand with Ross and the local Sheriff. Hank is shot and killed in the assault, but his sacrifice is not in vain. Using a community-created 3D avatar of Roy Merritt to coordinate a counterattack, the holon of Greely is able to defeat the assault force.

'''The Major''' is now the most wanted man in the Daemon community for his numerous crimes including the murder of Roy Merritt. An old hand at suppressing third worlds, the Major continues to make plans against the Daemon. He ruminates about his past as a heavy for the big corporations, killing people who have threatened their exploitation of foreign countries. He escapes an attempt on his life by Loki, but the experience makes the Major realize that he may not win this war.

In battling the Daemon, the government has been forced into a difficult alliance with private corporations employing the Major, giving rise to private armies who use the cover of night and corporate propaganda to create a state of fear. Intensifying his efforts the Major has dispatched foreign bought mercenaries and uses the corporate media to lie to the general public.

Developing a way to penetrate the Darknet by recruiting homeless teenagers, he eventually ambushes Loki taking him prisoner. He tortures Loki both for revenge and so that the Major can steal his identity within the Darknet. He later heads the Midwestern offensive from the Sky Ranch while simultaneously capturing Sebeck. After a speech in which he notes that the general population needs to be controlled by a ruling class, he orders Sebeck to be killed to keep the cover story of his past "execution".

After his plans collapse, the Major hides in a secret bomb shelter at Sky Ranch and awaits a chance to escape. Ten days after the defeat of his forces, the Major heads above ground now using Loki's stolen identity, only to discover that he is surrounded by both Razorbacks and the 3D avatar of Boerner.

The book ends with his inevitable death and the start of a new world.

In the [[Embryogenesis|development]] of [[Vertebrate|vertebrate animals]], the '''functional matrix hypothesis''' is a phenomenological description of bone growth.

[[File:Logo_UFZ.png|right|frameless|275px]]
The work of the '''Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research – UFZ''' (prior to 28 November 2006  UFZ-Umweltforschungszentrum Leipzig-Halle GmbH) covers both basic research and applied research.

The UFZ was established on 12 December 1991. The Centre commenced its research activities on 2 January 1992. The UFZ has locations in [[Leipzig]], [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]] and [[Magdeburg]]. In addition, it operates experimental stations in Bad Lauchstädt and Falkenberg. The UFZ employs a total of 1,050 employees (as of 31 December 2016).

The UFZ has been operating KUBUS, a modern communications and event venue in Leipzig, since 2004. KUBUS has flexible event spaces in a range of sizes and accommodates up to 550 people.

== Research areas ==

As an international competence centre for environmental sciences, the UFZ investigates interrelationships between humans and nature under the influence of global change. The research activities of UFZ scientists focus on the terrestrial environment – on densely populated urban and industrial conurbations, on agricultural landscapes and near-natural landscapes. They examine issues relating to future land use, the preservation of biological diversity and of ecosystem services, the sustainable management of soil and water resources and the effect of chemicals on humans and the environment – from the level of single cells and organisms up to the scale of regions.

The work of the UFZ is characterised by integrated environmental research that overcomes disciplinary boundaries between the natural and social sciences (interdisciplinarity) and brings together decision-makers from business, government and society (transdisciplinarity). Major scientific infrastructures such as climate and land-use experiments (e.g., [https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=40038 GCEF Global Change Experimental Facility], [http://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=38050 ProVis Centre for the visualisation of biochemical processes at cellular level]), platforms and technologies for environmental monitoring (e.g. [http://www.tereno.net/overview-en?set_language=en TERENO terrestrial environmental observatories]), modelling and visualisation (e.g., [https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=37716 TESSIN/VisLab Terrestrial Environmental System Simulation &amp; Integration Network]) have been or are being initiated, developed and used as part of cooperation arrangements and networks at national and international level.

The goal of UFZ research is to identify ways in which fundamental natural resources can be used sustainably for the well-being of humans and the environment.

== Research organisation ==
[[File:Research structure ufz.jpg|thumb|500px|Research organisation of the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research]]

The integrated environmental research carried out by the UFZ is organised into six topic areas. Topic areas 1–4 address core topics; topic areas 5 and 6 comprise cross-sectional competences:

These topic areas have been developed by the UFZ in response to challenges facing society in times of global change: climate change, land-use change, population growth, societies working under conditions of scarcity, globalisation, urbanisation, decline in biodiversity, rising energy and food demands, rising quantity and variety of chemicals impacting people and the environment, new patterns in national and global governance.

A total of 36 method-oriented departments are assigned to the six strategic topic areas. The large number of departments shows the wide subject range and diversity of research at the UFZ:

== Member, cooperation arrangements, networks, certifications ==

The UFZ is a member of the [https://www.helmholtz.de Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]. Eighteen natural/engineering sciences and medical/biological research centres with over 38,000 employees and an annual budget of over four billion euros came together to create the association. The UFZ carries out research in three of the total of six areas of Helmholtz Association research: (1) Earth and Environment (85 % of UFZ resources), (2) Energy (8 %) and (3) Health (7 %).

The UFZ cooperates and works with a large number of government agencies, research facilities and organisations at a national and international level (including UNEP, EU, [http://www.ipcc.ch/ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)], [https://www.ipbes.net/ Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES)], the [https://www.umweltbundesamt.de/en Federal Environment Agency (UBA)], the [http://www.bfr.bund.de/en/home.html Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR)], and the [https://www.bfn.de/en.html Federal Environment Agency (BfN)]).

UFZ is a member of [http://www.peer.eu/ PEER (Partnership for European Environmental Research)]. PEER is a network of eight European environmental research centres, and was established in 2001. Over 5,000 people are employed in PEER centres. The total budget of all eight centres is around €430 million per year. By carrying out joint research projects and fostering cooperation between European and international researchers, PEER aims to contribute to the strengthening of environmental research and its role at the European level.

The UFZ, together with the universities of Leipzig, Halle-Wittenberg and Jena and other research facilities, is a cooperation partner of the [https://www.idiv.de/ German Centre for Integrative Biodiversity Research (iDiv)], which was established in 2012. iDiv is based in Leipzig and is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation).

The UFZ has been accredited under EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit System) since 2005. It has been certified under the “berufundfamilie” (job and family) audit since 2014.

== Funding ==
The basic funding for the UFZ is provided by the Federal Republic of Germany (90%) and the Federal States of Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt (5% each) to a total of €64.9 million. The total budget including third-party funds and other income is €89.6 million (as of Dec. 2016).

== Publications ==
The UFZ publishes a series of brochures, research papers and other publications. An annual report on the work of the Centre is published each year. An overview of publications can be found on the [http://www.ufz.de UFZ website].

The '''history of agricultural science''' is a sub-field of the [[history of agriculture]] which looks at the [[scientific]] advancement of techniques and understanding of [[agriculture]]. Early study of organic production in [[botanical garden]]s was continued in with [[agricultural experiment station]]s in several countries.

Fertilizer is a major contribution to agriculture history increasing the fertility of the soil and minimizing nutrient loss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipni.net/ppiweb/bcrops.nsf/%24webindex/0022BBC19C02604A852575C50062FBB7/%24file/BC09-2p12.pdf|title=The Role of Fertilizer in Growing the World’s Food|last=Roberts|first=T.L.|date=2009|website=International Plant Nutrition Institute|archive-url=https://www.ipni.net/ppiweb/bcrops.nsf/%24webindex/0022BBC19C02604A852575C50062FBB7/%24file/BC09-2p12.pdf|archivedate=26 April 2018|dead-url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific study of [[fertilizer]] was advanced significantly in 1840 with the publication ''Die organische Chemie in ihrer Anwendung auf Agrikulturchemie und Physiologie'' (Organic Chemistry in Its Applications to Agriculture and Physiology) by [[Justus von Liebig]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/9612/the-agricultural-sciences#toc59252|title=The agricultural sciences|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Liebig's advances in agricultural science was the discovery of [[nitrogen]] as an essential plant nutrient.

==Fertilizer==
{{Main|History of fertilizer}}

The first method of soil nourishment utilized [[compost]]. Composting used rotten organic materials to replenish the soil of its nutrients and dates back to tenth and twelfth century Arab writings.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.extension.illinois.edu/homecompost/history.cfm|title=History of Composting - Composting for the Homeowner - University of Illinois Extension|website=web.extension.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composting was a normal and widely used practice of fertilization, up into the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/1671/Composting-History.html#ixzz5DqHBwwv2|title=Composting - History|website=science.jrank.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Friedrich Mayer (agriculturist)|Johann Friedrich Mayer]] was the first scientist to publish experiments on the use of gypsum as a fertilizer, but the mechanism that made it function as a fertilizer was contested by his contemporaries.&lt;ref name="JB 1840"&gt;John Armstrong, Jesse Buel. ''A Treatise on Agriculture, The Present Condition of the Art Abroad and at Home, and the Theory and Practice of Husbandry. To which is Added, a Dissertation on the Kitchen and Fruit Garden.'' 1840. p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Justus von Liebig, a founder of agricultural chemistry, studied organic compounds in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.famousscientists.org/justus-von-liebig/|title=Justus von Liebig - Biography, Facts and Pictures|website=www.famousscientists.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840, Liebig published what is now known as [[Liebig's law of the minimum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spar.msstate.edu/class/EPP-2008/Chapter%202/Reference%20Material/Law%20of%20Minimum.pdf|title=On the Origin of the Theory of Mineral Nutrition of Plants and the Law of the Minimum
|last1=van der Ploeg|first1=R.R.|last2=Bo¨hm|first2=W.|last3=Kirkham|first3=M.B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liebig's law states that growth is not controlled by the total amount of resources available, but by the limiting factor. The three mandatory limiting factors for plant growth are nutrients like phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen. He also focused on the importance of ammonia.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The production of synthetic ammonia was acquired by Fritz Haber and Carl Bosh. Haber discovered the reaction process to produce ammonia and Bosh was able to pressurize it to complete the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tfi.org/the-feed/fertilizer-history-haber-bosch-process|title=Fertilizer History: The Haber-Bosch Process|website=www.tfi.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together Haber and Bosch came up with the [[Haber process|Haber-Bosch process]] that fixated nitrogen to produce ammonia that is used in most fertilizers. In 1918 Fritz Haber received a Nobel prize in Chemistry for the invention of this process. Carl Bosch also received a Nobel Prize in 1918, but for high-pressure studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/technology/Haber-Bosch-process|title=Haber-Bosch process {{!}} chemistry|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the pressure studies this process wouldn’t be possible.

In the United States, a scientific revolution in agriculture began with the [[Hatch Act of 1887|Hatch Act]] of 1887, which used the term "agricultural science". The Hatch Act was driven by farmers' interest in knowing the constituents of early artificial fertilizer. Later on, the [[Smith-Hughes Act]] of 1917 shifted agricultural education back to its vocational roots, but the scientific foundation had been built.&lt;ref&gt;Hillison J. (1996). [http://pubs.aged.tamu.edu/jae/pdf/vol37/37-04-08.pdf The Origins of Agriscience: Or Where Did All That Scientific Agriculture Come From?]. ''Journal of Agricultural Education''.&lt;/ref&gt; After 1906, public expenditures on agricultural research in the US exceeded private expenditures for the next 44 years.&lt;ref name=ScienceForAg&gt;Huffman WE, Evenson RE. (2006). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWcolrGftT0C Science for Agriculture]''. [[Blackwell Publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
{{Main|History of genetics}}
A genetic study of [[Agricultural science]] began with [[Gregor Mendel]]'s work. Using statistical methods, Mendel developed the model of [[Mendelian inheritance]] which accurately describes the inheritance of dominant and recessive genes. His results were controversial at the time and were not widely accepted.

In 1900, [[Hugo de Vries]] published his findings after rediscovering Mendel's work, and in 1905 [[William Bateson]] coined the term "genetics" in a letter to [[Adam Sedgwick]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jic.ac.uk/corporate/about/bateson.htm Online copy of William Bateson's letter to Adam Sedgwick] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013020831/http://www.jic.ac.uk/corporate/about/bateson.htm |date=2007-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of genetics carried into an [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment|experiment isolating DNA]].

==Agronomy==
In 1843, [[John Lawes]] and [[Henry Gilbert]] began a set of long-term field experiments in [[agronomy]] at [[Rothamsted Research Station]] in England; some of them are still running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Long Term Experiments|url=https://www.rothamsted.ac.uk/long-term-experiments|publisher=Rothamsted Research|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, [[Albert Howard|Sir Albert Howard]], studied agronomy and focused on organic agriculture processes. In 1943, Howard published his book on ''An Agriculture Testament.'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Education==
The passing of Smith- Hughes Act in 1917 was what allowed agricultural education to enter public schools.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.naae.org/whatisaged/index.cfm|title=What is Agricultural Education?|website=National Association of Agricultural Educators|access-date=2018-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Agriculture took a big hit between the late 1920’s and early 1930’s during the great depression and dust bowl. The [https://www.ffa.org/about/what-is-ffa/ffa-history Future Farmers of America (FFA)], once known as Future Farmers of Virginia  was created to educate and maintain interest of potential farmers in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ffa.org/about/what-is-ffa/ffa-history|title=FFA History|last=|first=|date=|website=www.FFA. org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years this organization has changed the world and educated many about farming processes and encouraged agriculture participation.

National Association of Agricultural Educators (NAAE) began to help give teachers the ability to start a FFA chapter in their school system and standardize the curriculum all over the country.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

There are various universities around the United States which are well known for educating students in the field of the agricultural sciences. These universities include [[Texas A&amp;M University|Texas A&amp;M]], [[Stephen F. Austin State University]], [[University of Idaho]] and many others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9186">'''Ioliomics''' is a research discipline dealing with the studies of [[ion]]s in liquids (or liquid phases) and stipulated with fundamental differences of [[ionic interaction]]s.&lt;ref name=ChemRev2017/&gt;  The name is a combination of IOns, LIquids and -OMICS. Ioliomics covers a broad research area concerning structure, properties and applications of ions involved in various biological and chemical systems. The concept of this research discipline is related to other comprehensive research fields, such as [[genomics]], [[proteomics]], [[glycomics]], [[petroleomics]], etc., where the suffix ''-omics'' is used for describing the comprehensiveness of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kandpal|first1=RP|last2=Saviola|first2=B|last3=Felton|first3=J|title=The era of ’omics unlimited.|journal=BioTechniques|date=April 2009|volume=46|issue=5|pages=351−355|doi=10.2144/000113137|pmid=19480630|url=http://www.biotechniques.com/BiotechniquesJournal/specialissues/2009/April/The-era-of-omics-unlimited/biotechniques-132593.html|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundamental nature ==
The nature of [[chemical interactions]] and their description is one of the most fundamental problems in [[chemistry]]. The concepts of [[Covalent bond|covalent]] and [[Ionic bond|ionic]] bonds which emerged in the beginning of the 20th century specify the profound differences between their [[electronic structure]]s. These differences, in turn, lead to dramatically different behavior of [[Covalent compound|covalent]] and [[ionic compound]]s both in the [[solution]] and [[Phase (matter)|solid phase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=GN|title=The atom and the molecule|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|date=April 1916|volume=38|issue=4|pages=762–785|doi=10.1021/ja02261a002|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja02261a002|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the solid phase, ionic compounds, e.g. [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]], are prone to formation of [[crystal lattice]]s; in polar [[solvent]]s, they dissociate into ions surrounded by solvate shells, thus rendering the solution highly ionic [[conductive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkins|first1=P|last2=de Paula|first2=J|title=Atkins’ Physical Chemistry|date=2006|publisher=WH Freman|location=New York|isbn=9780198700722|edition=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to [[covalent bond]]s, [[Ionic bonding|ionic interactions]] demonstrate flexible, dynamic behavior, which allows tuning ionic compounds to obtain desired properties.

== Importance ==
[[Ionic compound]]s interact strongly with the solvent medium; therefore, their impact on chemical and biochemical processes involving [[ion]]s can be significant. Even in the case of simplest [[ion]]s and [[solvent]]s, the presence of the former can lead to rearrangement and restructuring of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mancinelli|first1=R|last2=Botti|first2=A|last3=Bruni|first3=F|last4=Ricci|first4=MA|last5=Soper|first5=AK|title=Perturbation of water structure due to monovalent ions in solution|journal=Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics|date=June 2007|volume=9|issue=23|pages=2959–2967|doi=10.1039/b701855j|pmid=17551619|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2007/CP/b701855j|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is established that ionic reactions are involved in numerous phenomena at the scales of whole [[Galaxy|galaxies]] or single living [[Cell (biology)|cells]].&lt;ref name=ChemRev2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geppert|first1=WD|last2=Larsson|first2=M|title=Experimental investigations into astrophysically relevant ionic reactions|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=December 2013|volume=113|issue=12|pages=8872–8905|doi=10.1021/cr400258m|pmid=24219419|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr400258m}}&lt;/ref&gt; To name a few, in living [[Cell (biology)|cells]], metal ions bind to [[Metalloprotein|metalloenzymes]] and other [[protein]]s therefore modulating their activity;&lt;ref name=ChemRev2006/&gt; [[ion]]s are involved in the control of neuronal functioning during [[Sleep-wake cycle|sleep – wakefulness cycles]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ding|first1=F|last2=O'Donnell|first2=J|last3=Xu|first3=Q|last4=Kang|first4=N|last5=Goldman|first5=N|last6=Nedergaard|first6=M|title=Changes in the composition of brain interstitial ions control the sleep-wake cycle|journal=Science|date=April 2016|volume=352|issue=6285|pages=550–555|doi=10.1126/science.aad4821|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6285/550|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  anomalous activity of [[ion channel]]s results in the development of various disorders, such as [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson’s]] and [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]] diseases,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zaydman|first1=MA|last2=Silva|first2=JR|last3=Cui|first3=J|title=Ion channel associated diseases: overview of molecular mechanisms|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=November 2012|volume=112|issue=12|pages=6319–6333|doi=10.1021/cr300360k|pmid=23151230|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr300360k|accessdate=3 February 2017|pmc=3586387}}&lt;/ref&gt;  etc. Thus, despite the problems associated with the studies on properties and activities of ions in various chemical and biological systems,&lt;ref name=ChemRev2017/&gt; this research field is among the most urgent ones.

== Ion-abundant liquid media ==
Of special interest are ion-abundant liquid media (such as [[ionic liquid]]s, [[molten salt]]s, liquid [[electrolyte]]s, etc.), which represent “liquid ions” with excellent tunable properties for different applications. The systems are famous for their ability to solvent-solute self-organization phenomena and are often employed in [[chemistry]], [[biochemistry]] and pharmaceutical research.&lt;ref name=ChemRev2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=R|last2=Warr|first2=GG|last3=Atkin|first3=R|title=Structure and nanostructure in ionic liquids|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=July 2015|volume=115|issue=13|pages=6357–6426|doi=10.1021/cr500411q|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr500411q|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most important features of ion-abundant liquid media is their huge potential to be fine-tuned. Thus, one can design an [[ionic liquid]] with virtually any combination of physicochemical or biochemical properties.&lt;ref name=Clean1999/&gt;
Research in the area of “liquid ions” is a rapidly developing scientific field, and numerous data on their properties and activities have been accumulated so far.&lt;ref name=ChemRev2017/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deetlefs|first1=M|last2=Fanselow|first2=M|last3=Seddon|first3=KR|title=Ionic liquids: the view from Mount Improbable|journal=RSC Advances|date=January 2016|volume=6|issue=6|pages=4280–4288|doi=10.1039/c5ra05829e|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2016/RA/C5RA05829E#!divAbstract|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, the concept finds applications in [[catalysis]], [[electrochemistry]], analytics, [[fuel]] production, [[biomass]] processing, [[biotechnology]], [[biochemistry]] and [[pharmaceutics]].&lt;ref name=ChemRev2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clean1999/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van Rantwijk|first1=F|last2=Sheldon|first2=RA|title=Biocatalysis in ionic liquids|journal=Chemical Reviews|date=June 2007|volume=107|issue=6|pages=2757–2785|doi=10.1021/cr050946x|pmid=17564484|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr050946x|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Egorova|first1=KS|last2=Ananikov|first2=VP|title=Toxicity of ionic liquids: eco(cyto)activity as complicated, but unavoidable parameter for task-specific optimization|journal=ChemSusChem|date=January 2014|volume=2|issue=3|pages=336–360|doi=10.1002/cssc.201300459|pmid=24399804|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cssc.201300459/abstract|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He was born in Wembley, Middlesex and educated at the [[Latymer Upper School]], Hammersmith and [[Jesus College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref name = RS&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27sawyer%27%29| title = Library and Archive catalogue| publisher= Royal Society| accessdate= 2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He started his career as a Technical Officer with the Meteorological Office involved in weather forecasting for RAF stations during World War II and was then sent to India to be involved in co-ordinating the meteorological service in South-East Asia Air Command (1943). On his return he joined the staff of the Forecast Research Division, Dunstable at its inception in 1949.&lt;ref name = RS/&gt;

==Work==
He was Chairman of British National Committee for Geodesy and Geophysics (1961), Assistant Director (Dynamical Research) at the Meteorological Office, Director of Research at the Meteorological Office (1965–1976) and President of the Commission for Atmospheric Sciences, World Meteorological Organisation (1968–1973). He retired in 1976.&lt;ref name = RS/&gt;

==Publications==
Sawyer published the study ''Man-made Carbon Dioxide and the "Greenhouse" Effect'' in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v239/n5366/abs/239023a0.html|title=Man-made Carbon Dioxide and the "Greenhouse" Effect|date=1 September 1972|journal=Nature|volume=239|pages=23–26|doi=10.1038/239023a0|author=J.

==Awards==
He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1962. His candidature citation read "''Mr. Sawyer is recognised as a leader in meteorological research, both in this country and abroad. With F.H. Bushby he devised the well-known 'baroclinic' model for numerical forecasting, using electronic computation, which is rightly regarded as a landmark in this difficult subject. His work on the characteristics of fronts is one of the few successful attempts to deal quantitatively with the dynamics (as distinct from the kinematices) of these important phenomena. He has done markedly original work on dynamical similarity in meteorology and his recent numerical calculations of air flow over mountains are believed to be the first realistic computations of their kind. In addition, he has contributed much to the detailed analysis of the salient features of large-scale atmospheric disturbances, including studies of the rainfall of depressions, the behavious of the tropopause, and the cloud systems associated with fronts. His work is characteristic of the younger school of dynamical meteorologists, and is doing much to make meteorology a more exact science than hitherto''."&lt;ref name = RS/&gt;

He was also a Fellow of the Meteorological Society (FRMetS) and their president from 1963 to 1965. He was awarded their [[Symons Gold Medal]] in 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1371797/John-Sawyer.html|title= John Sawyer|work= The Telegraph|accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William K. Heine presented a paper "[http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=3098 A Laser Scanning Phonograph Record Player]" to the 57th [[Audio Engineering Society]] (AES) convention in May 1977. The paper details a method developed by Heine that employs a single 2.2&amp;nbsp;mW [[helium–neon laser]] for both tracking a record groove and reproducing the stereo audio of a phonograph in real time. In development since 1972, the working prototype was named the "LASERPHONE", and the methods it used for playback was awarded [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=3,992,593.PN.&amp;OS=PN/3,992,593&amp;RS=PN/3,992,593 U.S. Patent 3,992,593] on 16 November 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/about/3992593_Disc_phonograph_record_playback.html?id=UxI0AAAAEBAJ |title=Patent US3992593 – Disc phonograph record playback by laser generated diffraction pattern – Google Patents |publisher=Google.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heine concluded in his paper that he hoped his work would increase interest in using lasers for phonographic playback.

===Finial===
Four years later in 1981 Robert S. Reis, a graduate student in engineering at [[Stanford University]], wrote his master's thesis on "An Optical Turntable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senderogroup.com/about/reis.htm |title=Robert Reis Resum&amp;#233 |publisher=Senderogroup.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 he and fellow Stanford electrical engineer Robert E. Stoddard founded '''Finial Technology''' to develop and market a laser turntable, raising $7 million in [[venture capital]]. In 1984 servo-control expert Robert N. Stark joined the effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patent.ipexl.com/inventor/Robert_N_Stark_1.html |title=Robert N Stark – Inventor Patent Directory, Page 1 |publisher=Patent.ipexl.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-functioning mock-up of the proposed Finial turntable was shown at the 1984 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES), generating much interest and a fair amount of mystery, since the patents had not yet been granted and the details had to be kept secret. The first working model, the Finial LT-1 (Laser Turntable-1), was completed in time for the 1986 CES. The prototype revealed an interesting flaw of laser turntables: they are so accurate that they play every particle of dirt and dust on the record, rather than pushing them aside as a conventional stylus would. The non-contact laser pickup does have the advantages of eliminating record wear, tracking noise, turntable rumble and feedback from the speakers. The projected $2,500 street price (later raised to $3,786 in 1988) limited the potential market to professionals (libraries, radio stations and archivists) and a few well-heeled audiophiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Unfortunately for Finial, the laser turntable development exactly coincided with two major events,  [[Early 1980s recession|a major economic recession]], and the perfection and introduction of the Digital [[CD|Compact Disc]], which soon began flooding the market at prices comparable to LPs (with CD players in the $300 range). Vinyl record sales plummeted, and many existing turntable manufacturers went out of business as a result.

The Finial turntable never went into production. After a few hand-built (and finicky)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven R. Rochlin |url=http://www.enjoythemusic.com/magazine/viewpoint/0404/aachapter55.htm |title=Bill Gaw AA Chapter 55: ELP Laser Turntable |publisher=Enjoythemusic.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; prototypes were completed and shown, tooling delays, component unavailability (in the days before cheap lasers), marketing blunders, and high development costs kept pushing back the release date. With over US$20 million in venture capital invested, Finial was faced with a dilemma: to forge ahead with a selling price that was too high for most consumers, or to gamble on going into mass production at a much lower price and hoping the market would lower costs.

===ELP===
In late 1989 Finial's investors finally cut their losses and liquidated the firm, selling the patents to Japanese turntable maker [[Birmingham Sound Reproducers|BSR]], which became CTI Japan, which in turn created '''[[ELPJ|ELP Japan]]''' for continued development of the "super-audiophile" turntable. After eight more years of development the laser turntable was finally put on sale in 1997 – twenty years after the initial proposal – as the ELP LT-1XA Laser Turntable, with a list price of US$20,500 (in 2003 the price was lowered to US$10,500).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audioturntable.com/ |title=ELP Laser Turntable: plays vinyl records without a needle, presented by Audioturntable, Ltd |publisher=Audioturntable.com |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The turntable, which uses two lasers to read the groove and three more to position the head, does allow one to vary the depth at which the groove is read, possibly bypassing existing record wear. It will not, however, read clear or [[Unusual types of gramophone records|colored vinyl]] records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Valin |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.theabsolutesound.com/articles/elp-lt-1lrc-laser-turntable/ |title=ELP LT-1LRC Laser Turntable |publisher=The Absolute Sound |date=24 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ELP continues to sell laser turntables directly to consumers in two versions (LT-basic, and LT-master),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elpj.com/ltfeaturesandspecs/|title=LT Specifications {{!}} ELP Laser Turntable|website=elpj.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a reported cost of approximately $15,000 for the basic model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://diffuser.fm/laser-turntable/|title=The World's Only Commercially-Sold Laser Turntable|website=Diffuser.fm|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IRENE system==
A completely separate technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11851842 |title=You Can Play the Record, but Don't Touch |publisher=NPR |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been developed by physicists Carl Haber and Vitaliy Fadeyev of the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]. Installed in the [[Library of Congress]] late in 2006, the IRENE System (for Image, Reconstruct, Erase Noise, Etc.)&lt;ref&gt;https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-history/dawn-of-electronics/particle-physics-resurrects-alexander-graham-bells-voice&lt;/ref&gt; uses a two-dimensional camera rotating around the record and taking detailed photographs of the grooves. Software then uses the digital images to reconstruct the sound&lt;ref&gt;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/videos/category/arts-culture/playing-the-unplayable-records/&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2018 the system was used to play, for the first time, the only known recording of [[Alexander Graham Bell]]'s voice.  IRENE often produces a large amount of hiss with the recording, but it is very capable of removing pops and clicks produced by imperfections on the record surface. IRENE will only read lateral information (monophonic), but a three-dimensional scanner project is underway that will handle stereophonic and [[Quadraphonic sound|quadraphonic]] records, in addition to historical [[Vertical cut recording|hill-and-dale recordings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://irene.lbl.gov/ |title=IRENE project Web site |publisher=Irene.lbl.gov |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Lee–Carter model''' is a numerical algorithm used in [[mortality forecasting]] and [[life expectancy]] [[forecasting]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.soa.org/library/journals/north-american-actuarial-journal/2000/january/naaj0001_5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The input to the model is a matrix of age specific [[mortality rates]] ordered monotonically by time, usually with ages in columns and years in rows.  The output is another forecasted matrix of mortality rates.

The model uses the [[singular value decomposition]] (SVD) to find a [[univariate]] [[time series]] vector "k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;" that captures 80–90% of the mortality trend (here the subscript "t" refers to time), a vector "b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;" that describes the amount of mortality change at a given age for a unit of yearly total mortality change (here the subscript "x" refers to age), and a scaling constant (referred to here as s&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; but unnamed in the literature). Surprisingly, k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is usually linear, implying that gains to life expectancy are fairly constant year after year in most populations. Before being input to the SVD, age specific mortality rates are transformed into "a&lt;sub&gt;x,t&lt;/sub&gt;", by taking their [[logarithms]], and then [[centering]] them by subtracting their age-specific means (calculated over time).  (The subscript "x,t" refers to the fact that a&lt;sub&gt;x,t&lt;/sub&gt; spans both age and time.)  Many researchers adjust the k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; vector by fitting it to empirical life expectancies for each year, using the a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; just generated with the SVD; when adjusted using this approach, changes to k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; are usually small.

To forecast mortality, the above k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; (either adjusted or not) is projected into the future using [[ARIMA]] time series methods, the corresponding future a&lt;sub&gt;x,t+n&lt;/sub&gt; is recovered by multiplying k&lt;sub&gt;t+n&lt;/sub&gt; by b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and the appropriate diagonal element of S (when [U S V] = svd(mort)), and the actual  mortality rates are recovered by taking exponentials of this vector.  Because of the linearity of k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, it is generally modeled as a [[random walk]] with trend. Life expectancy and other [[life table]] measures can be calculated from this forecasted matrix after adding back the means and taking exponentials to yield regular mortality rates.

In most implementations, [[confidence intervals]] for the forecasts are generated by simulating multiple mortality forecasts using [[Monte-Carlo]] methods; a band of mortality between 5% and 95% percentiles of the simulated results is considered to be a valid forecast.  These simulations are done by extending k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; into the future using randomization based on the [[standard error]] of k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; derived from the input data.

In outline and [[Matlab]]-style pseudocode, the algorithm is as follows:

#
# Create a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; by taking [[logarithms]] of the mortality rates and centering the results with the average log mortality at a given age.
# Derive k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, a scaling eigenvalue, and b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; from  U(:,1), S(1,1), V(1,:), where [U S V] = svd(mort).
# Forecast k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; with standard univariate [[ARIMA]] methods.
# Use the forecast k&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; with the original b&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and a&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; to calculate logged mortality rates for each forecast year.
# Recover regular mortality rates by calculating the exponential of the forecasted log mortality rates. 
#

Without applying SVD or some other method of [[dimension reduction]] the table of mortality data is a highly correlated multivariate data series; the complexity of these multidimensional time series makes such them almost impossible to forecast.  SVD has become widely used as a method of dimension reduction in many disparate fields, including by [[Google]] in their [[page rank]] algorithm.

The Lee–Carter model was introduced by [[Ronald D. Lee]] and Lawrence Carter in 1992 with the article "Modeling and Forecasting the Time Series of U.S. Mortality," (Journal of the American Statistical Association 87 (September): 659–671).&lt;ref&gt;http://faculty.washington.edu/samclark/soc533/Syllabus/Readings/7/1/Lee-R-etal_1992_Modeling-Forecasting-US-Mortality.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The model grew out of their work in the late 1980s and early 1990s attempting to use [[inverse projection]] to infer rates in [[historical demography]].&lt;ref&gt;http://escholarship.org/uc/item/76b3712p&lt;/ref&gt; The model has been used by the United States [[Social Security Administration]], the US [[Census Bureau]], and the United Nations.  It has become the most widely used mortality forecasting technique in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;http://gking.harvard.edu/files/lc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been extensions to the Lee–Carter, most notably to account for missing years, correlated male and female populations, and large scale coherency in populations that share a mortality regime (western Europe, for example).  Many related papers can be found on [http://www.ceda.berkeley.edu/People/rlee.html Professor Ronald Lee's] website.

There are surprisingly few software packages for forecasting with the Lee-Carter Model.  [http://lcfit.demog.berkeley.edu LCFIT] is a web-based package with interactive forms.  Professor [[Rob J. Hyndman]] provides an [http://robjhyndman.com/software/demography/  R package for demography] that includes routines for creating and forecasting a Lee-Carter Model. Professor German Rodriguez provides [http://data.princeton.edu/eco572/LeeCarter.html code for the Lee-Carter Model] using [[Stata]]. Using [[Matlab]], Professor Eric Jondeau and Professor Michael Rockinger have put together the [https://github.com/mrockinger/Matlab-Longevity-Toolbox/ Longevity Toolbox] for parameter estimation.

[[File:Linearmotorprinzip.png|thumb|right|Synchronous linear motors are straightened versions of permanent magnet rotor motors]]

A '''linear motor''' is an [[electric motor]] that has had its [[stator]] and [[rotor (electric)|rotor]] "unrolled" so that instead of producing a [[torque]] ([[rotation]]) it produces a linear [[force]] along its length. However, linear motors are not necessarily straight. Characteristically, a linear motor's active section has ends, whereas more conventional motors are arranged as a continuous loop.

The most common mode of operation is as a [[Lorentz force|Lorentz]]-type actuator, in which the applied force is [[linear equation|linearly proportional]] to the [[electric current|current]] and the [[magnetic field]] &lt;math&gt;(\vec F = I \vec L \times \vec B)&lt;/math&gt;.

Many designs have been put forward for linear motors, falling into two major categories, low-acceleration and high-acceleration linear motors. Low-acceleration linear motors are suitable for [[maglev train]]s and other ground-based transportation applications. High-acceleration linear motors are normally rather short, and are designed to accelerate an object to a very high speed, for example see the [[coilgun]].

High-acceleration linear motors are typically used in studies of [[hypervelocity]] collisions, as [[weapon]]s, or as [[mass driver]]s for [[spacecraft propulsion]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} They are usually of the AC [[linear induction motor]] (LIM) design with an active [[three-phase]] winding on one side of the air-gap and a passive conductor plate on the other side. However, the direct current [[homopolar motor|homopolar]] linear motor [[railgun]] is another high acceleration linear motor design. The low-acceleration, high speed and high power motors are usually of the '''linear synchronous motor''' (LSM) design, with an active winding on one side of the air-gap and an array of alternate-pole magnets on the other side. These magnets can be [[permanent magnet]]s or [[electromagnet]]s. The [[Shanghai Transrapid]] motor is an LSM.

==Types==

===Synchronous===
In this design the rate of movement of the magnetic field is controlled, usually electronically, to track the motion of the rotor. For cost reasons synchronous linear motors rarely use [[Commutator (electric)|commutators]], so the rotor often contains permanent magnets, or [[Magnetic_core#Soft_iron|soft iron]]. Examples include [[coilgun]]s and the motors used on some [[maglev]] systems, as well as many other linear motors.

===Induction===
[[File:Three phase linear induction motor.gif|thumb|A typical 3 phase linear induction motor. An aluminium plate on top often forms the secondary "rotor".]]
{{main|Linear induction motor}}
In this design, the force is produced by a moving linear [[magnetic field]] acting on conductors in the field. Any conductor, be it a loop, a coil or simply a piece of plate metal, that is placed in this field will have [[eddy current]]s [[electromagnetic induction|induced]] in it thus creating an opposing magnetic field, in accordance with [[Lenz's law]].&lt;ref name=Liasi&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghaseminejad Liasi|first1=Sahand|title=What are linear motors?|date=15 May 2015|page=1-50|doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.16250.18887|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322040360_What_are_linear_motors|accessdate=24 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two opposing fields will repel each other, thus creating motion as the magnetic field sweeps through the metal.

===Homopolar===
[[File:Railgun-1.svg|thumb|Railgun schematic]]
{{main|Railgun}}
In this design a large current is passed through a metal sabot across sliding contacts that are fed from two rails. The magnetic field this generates causes the metal to be projected along the rails.

===Low acceleration===
The history of linear electric motors can be traced back at least as far as the 1840s, to the work of [[Charles Wheatstone]] at [[King's College London|King's College]] in London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/college/history/people/wheatstone.html |title=Charles Wheatstone - College History - King's College London |publisher=Kcl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091021162729/http://www.kcl.ac.uk/college/history/people/wheatstone.html |archivedate=2009-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but Wheatstone's model was too inefficient to be practical. A feasible linear induction motor is described in the {{US patent|782312}} (1905 - inventor Alfred Zehden of Frankfurt-am-Main), for driving trains or lifts. The German engineer [[Hermann Kemper]] built a working model in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cem.colorado.edu/archives/fl1997/thor.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928000224/http://cem.colorado.edu/archives/fl1997/thor.html |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1940s, Dr. [[Eric Laithwaite]] of [[University of Manchester|Manchester University]], later Professor of Heavy Electrical Engineering at [[Imperial College]] in [[London]] developed the first full-size working model. In a single sided version the magnetic repulsion forces the conductor away from the stator, levitating it, and carrying it along in the direction of the moving magnetic field. He called the later versions of it [[magnetic river]].

[[File:Linear Motor of Toei Ōedo Line.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A linear motor for trains running Toei Oedo line]]
Because of these properties, linear motors are often used in [[magnetic levitation|maglev]] propulsion, as in the Japanese [[Linimo]] [[magnetic levitation train]] line near [[Nagoya]]. However, linear motors have been used independently of magnetic levitation, as in [[Bombardier Transportation|Bombardier]]'s [[Bombardier Advanced Rapid Transit|Advanced Rapid Transit]] systems worldwide and a number of modern Japanese subways, including [[Tokyo]]'s [[Toei Oedo Line]].

Similar technology is also used in some [[roller coaster]]s with modifications but, at present, is still impractical on street running [[tram]]s, although this, in theory, could be done by burying it in a slotted conduit.

Outside of public transportation, vertical linear motors have been proposed as lifting mechanisms in deep [[mining|mine]]s, and the use of linear motors is growing in [[motion control]] applications. They are also often used on sliding doors, such as those of [[low floor]] trams such as the [[Citadis]] and the [[Eurotram]]. Dual axis linear motors also exist. These specialized devices have been used to provide direct ''X''-''Y'' motion for precision laser cutting of cloth and sheet metal, automated [[Technical drawing|drafting]], and cable forming. Most linear motors in use are LIM (linear induction motor), or LSM (linear synchronous motor). Linear DC motors are not used due to higher cost and linear SRM suffers from poor thrust. So for long run in traction LIM is mostly preferred and for short run LSM is mostly preferred.

===High acceleration===
High-acceleration linear motors have been suggested for a number of uses.
They have been considered for use as [[weapon]]s, since current [[armour-piercing]] ammunition tends to consist of small rounds with very high [[kinetic energy]], for which just such motors are suitable. Many amusement park [[launched roller coaster]]s now use linear induction motors to propel the train at a high speed, as an alternative to using a [[lift hill]]. The United States Navy is also using linear induction motors in the [[Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System]] that will replace traditional [[steam catapult]]s on future aircraft carriers. They have also been suggested for use in [[spacecraft propulsion]]. In this context they are usually called [[mass driver]]s. The simplest way to use mass drivers for spacecraft propulsion would be to build a large mass driver that can accelerate cargo up to [[escape velocity]], though [[reusable launch system|RLV]] launch assist like [[StarTram]] to [[low earth orbit]] has also been investigated.

High-acceleration linear motors are difficult to design for a number of reasons. They require large amounts of [[energy]] in very short periods of time. One rocket launcher design&lt;ref name="coilgun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coilgun.info/theory/electroguns.htm|title=Magnetic Materials - Electromagnetic Guns|publisher=coilgun.info|accessdate=2014-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; calls for 300 GJ for each launch in the space of less than a second. Normal [[electrical generator]]s are not designed for this kind of load, but short-term electrical energy storage methods can be used. [[Capacitors]] are bulky and expensive but can supply large amounts of energy quickly. [[Homopolar generator]]s can be used to convert the kinetic energy of a [[flywheel]] into electric energy very rapidly. High-acceleration linear motors also require very strong magnetic fields; in fact, the magnetic fields are often too strong to permit the use of [[superconductivity|superconductors]]. However, with careful design, this need not be a major problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Superconductor Science and Technology|year = 2010|title = A single-sided linear synchronous motor with a high temperature superconducting coil as the excitation system|first1 = F. |last1 = Yen|first2 = J. |last2 = Li|first3 = S.

Two different basic designs have been invented for high-acceleration linear motors: [[railgun]]s and [[coilgun]]s.

== Usage ==
Linear motors are widely used. One of the major uses of linear motors is for propelling the shuttle in [[loom]]s.

Linear motors have been used for sliding doors and various similar actuators.  Also, they have been used for baggage handing and can even drive large-scale bulk materials transport solutions.

Linear motors are sometimes used to create rotary motion, for example, they have been used at observatories to deal with the large radius of curvature.

A linear motor system is often used on launched rollercoasters such as ICON at Blackpool Pleasure Beach, instead of the conventional ‘catch-car &amp; pulley’ method seen on the likes of Stealth at Thorpe Park in England. 

A linear motor has been used for accelerating cars for [[crash test]]s.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Popular Science|publisher=Bonnier Corporation|issn=0161-7370|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pgAAAAAAMBAJ|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Monorail====
{{Main|Monorail}}
{{Refimprove|date=July 2009}}
* There is at least one known monorail system which is '''not''' magnetically levitated, but nonetheless uses linear motors. This is the [[Moscow Monorail]]. Originally, traditional motors and wheels were to be used. However, it was discovered during test runs that the proposed motors and wheels would fail to provide adequate traction under some conditions, for example, when ice appeared on the rail. Hence, wheels are still used, but the trains use linear motors to accelerate and slow down. This is possibly the only use of such a combination, due to the lack of such requirements for other train systems.
* The [[TELMAGV]] is a prototype of a monorail system that is also not magnetically levitated but uses linear motors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5092">This is a '''list of aesthetic principles of music'''.  It enumerates the various qualities by which music is judged aesthetically.

*''[[Blues]]'', an [[African American]] musical genre and quality of music that reflects an emotionally genuine soul and expresses melancholy, loneliness and tragedy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mariza lifts fado to higher level|work=Chicago Tribune|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/chi-0608030290aug04,1,5455261.story?coll=chi-entertainment-utl|accessdate=October 13, 2006|author=Reich, Howard}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Conyach'', a musical quality that provokes the venting of emotions in listeners, associated with the music of Scottish Travelers.&lt;ref&gt;Ritchie, pg. 80&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Dor'', a "pleasant feeling of melancholy" especially evoked by the [[doina]] music &lt;ref&gt;Broughton, Simon, "Taraf Traditions" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pgs. 237 - 247&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[duende (art)|Duende]]'', a complex emotional quality of Spanish music, especially [[flamenco]] &lt;ref&gt;Fairley, Jan, "A Wild, Savage Feeling in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pgs. 279 - 291&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Spice mix#Masala|Masala]]'', a term borrowed from Indian cookery to intend a Mumbai spicy musical mixture and the local production of movies and music (see also [[Masala film]])
*''[[Sakit Hati]]'' (lit. Indonesian for ''sick liver''), an Indonesian term, associated with the [[degung]] genre denoting a sense of wistful long and sadness.&lt;ref&gt;Bass, Colin, "No Risk - No Fun!", in the ''Rough Guides to World Music'', pg. 131 - 142&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Mehna]]'', a term associated with Algeria [[raï]] music and is said to be similar to ''duende'' &lt;ref&gt;Morgan, Andy, "Music Under Fire" in the ''Rough Guide to World Music'', pg. 413–424&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Salsa music|Salsa]]'', closely associated with the salsa genre, the term ''salsa'' denoting a "wild" and "frenzied" musical experience, being used as a vocal interjection to acknowledge the musical excitement of a performance.  This usage can also express a sense of pan-Latin cultural identity, based around the "hotness" and "spiciness" of Latin culture.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel, pg. 46; Morales, pp 56 - 59&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Saudade]]'', a Portuguese term, referring to an important element of [[fado]]; ''saudade'' is a mood, described as "a vague and constant desire for something that does not and probably can not exist, for something other than the present, a turning towards the future; not an active discontent or poignant sadness, but an indolent dreaming wistfulness", with roots in "Islamic [[fatalism]], sailors' loneliness, and the unrequited love which was the perennial theme of [[troubadour]] poetry" &lt;ref&gt;Manuel, ''Popular Musics'', pg. 119: Manuel is the source of the "Islamic fatalism... troubadour poetry", and he sources "a vague and constant... indolent dreaming wistfulness" to Aubrey Bell, in Gallop, ''Portugal'', 262&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[soul music|Soul]]'', is a music genre, and also a quality of music or of performance which evokes an emotional state and is reflective of African American performance techniques &lt;ref name="Friedman pg. 46"&gt;Singer and Friedman, cited in Manuel, pg. 46&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Swing (genre)|Swing]]'', [[Swing (dance)|swing dance]] and swing jazz, a genre of popular dance music, and a quality of emotionally and culturally genuine music in the African American community &lt;ref name="Friedman pg. 46"/&gt;
*''[[Tezeta]]'', an [[music of Ethiopia|Ethiopian musical]] term, evocative of melancholy, nostalgia and bittersweet longing, being originally a traditional song, then a genre, a [[musical mode]] and a marker of cultural identity &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/music/planet/stories/s604793.htm|title=Ethiopian Blues &amp; Ballads|work=The Planet|accessdate=September 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4503">[[File:Kerze 2007k.JPG|thumb|upright|A luminous [[candle]] flame]]
A '''luminous flame''' is a burning [[flame]] which is brightly visible. Much of its output is in the form of [[visible light]], as well as heat or light in the non-visible wavelengths.

An early study of flame luminosity was conducted by [[Michael Faraday]] and became part of his series of [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures]], ''[[The Chemical History of a Candle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Luminosity ==
[[File:Fire dancer.JPG|thumb|Circus [[fire art]]s rely on a brightly luminous flame, ideally with minimal heat output]]
In the simplest case, the yellow flame is [[luminosity|luminous]] due to small [[soot]] particles in the flame which are heated to [[incandescence]]. Producing a deliberately luminous flame requires either a shortage of combustion air (as in a [[Bunsen burner]]) or a local excess of fuel (as for a [[kerosene]] torch).{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} Because of this dependency upon relatively inefficient combustion, luminosity is associated with [[diffusion flame]]s and is lessened with [[premixed flame]]s.

The flame is yellow because of its temperature. To produce enough soot to be luminous, the flame is operated at a lower temperature than its efficient heating flame (see [[#Bunsen burner|Bunsen burner]]). The colour of simple incandescence is due to [[black-body radiation]]. By [[Planck's law]], as the temperature decreases, the peak of the black-body radiation curve moves to longer wavelengths, i.e. from the blue to the yellow. However, the blue light from a gas burner's premixed flame is primarily a product of molecular emission (Swan bands) rather than black-body radiation.

Other factors, particularly the fuel chemistry and its propensity for forming soot, have an influence on luminosity.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The Victorian chemist, [[Edward Frankland#Scientific work|Edward Frankland]], studied luminosity in flames and discovered that their luminosity also increased with [[pressure]].

== Bunsen burner ==
[[File:Bunsen_burner_flame_types.jpg|thumb|A variety of [[Bunsen burner]] flames. Bunsen burners may be adjusted from a highly luminous flame (left) to a hotter 'roaring blue flame' (right)]]
One of the most familiar instances of a luminous flame is produced by a [[Bunsen burner]]. This burner has a controllable air supply and a constant gas jet: when the air supply is reduced, a highly luminous, and thus visible, orange 'safety flame' is produced. For heating work, the air inlet is opened and the burner produces a much hotter blue flame.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Combustion efficiency ==
Efficient combustion relies on the complete combustion of the fuel. Production of [[soot]] represents a waste of fuel (the soot could have been burned further) and may also be a problem for its build-up around jets and burners. Heating burners are thus usually designed to produce a ''non-''luminous flame.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Oil lamps ==
Lamps for illumination rather than heat may use a deliberately luminous flame. A more efficient method overall uses a [[gas mantle|mantle]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.ntlworld.com/munwai/history.htm A Brief History of the Incandescent Mantle Pressure Lamp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050703081357/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/munwai/history.htm |date=2005-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the incandescent soot in a luminous flame, the mantle is heated and then glows. The flame does not provide much light itself, and so a more heat-efficient non-luminous flame is preferred. Unlike simple soot, a mantle uses [[rare-earth element]]s to provide a bright white glow; the colour of the glow comes from the [[spectral line]]s of these elements, not from simple black-body radiation.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

== Flame testing ==
When performing a [[flame test]], the colour of a flame is affected by external materials added to it. A non-luminous flame is used, to avoid masking the test colour by the flame's own colour.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1269">[[Image:Lung chamber 042.jpg|thumb|A lung counter]]

A '''Lung counter''' is a system consisting of a [[radiation detector]], or detectors, and associated electronics that is used to measure [[Ionizing radiation|radiation]] emitted from [[radioactive material]] that has been inhaled by a person and is sufficiently insoluble as to remain in the [[lung]] for weeks, months, or years.

Often, such a system is housed in a [[low background counting chamber]] whose thick walls will be made of [[low-background steel]] (~20&amp;nbsp;cm thick) and will be lined with ~1&amp;nbsp;cm of lead, then perhaps thin layers of cadmium, or tin, with a final layer of copper.  The purpose of the lead, cadmium (or tin), and copper is to reduce the background in the low energy region of a [[gamma ray|gamma spectrum]] (typically less than 200 keV)

== Calibration ==

As a lung counter is primarily measuring radioactive materials that emit low energy [[gamma ray]]s or [[x-ray]]s, the [[imaging phantom|phantom]] used to calibrate the system must be [[anthropometric]]. An example of such a phantom is the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] Torso Phantom.

The '''National Solar Observatory ''' ('''NSO''') is a [[United States]] public [[research institute]] to advance the knowledge of the [[solar physics|physics]] of the [[Sun]].
NSO studies the Sun both as an [[astronomical object]] and as the dominant external influence on [[Earth]].
NSO is headquartered in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and operated facilities at two locations, at [[Sacramento Peak]] near [[Sunspot, New Mexico|Sunspot]] in [[New Mexico]], and at [[Kitt Peak]] in [[Arizona]] until the end of [[Fiscal_year#United_States|fiscal year]] 2017.
The institute is constructing the 4-meter [[Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope]] in the [[Haleakala Observatory]] on the island of [[Maui]].

NSO provides its observations to the scientific community. It operates facilities, develops advanced instrumentation both in-house and through partnerships, conducts solar research, and carries out educational and public outreach.

== Visiting the observatories ==
The National Solar Observatory HQ is located on the campus of the University of Colorado, Boulder. It also has some staff on [[Sacramento Peak]], where visitors are welcome during the daytime. The observatory lies in [[New Mexico]] at the southern end of [[New Mexico State Road 6563|NM Scenic Byway 6563]], about 18 miles (by car) south of [[Cloudcroft, New Mexico|Cloudcroft]] (on NM 82), and 40 miles southeast (by car) from [[Alamogordo, New Mexico|Alamogordo]] (on NM 70 and 54), in the village of [[Sunspot, New Mexico|Sunspot]] inside of the [[Lincoln National Forest]]. Sunspot is an unincorporated community in the Sacramento Mountains in Otero County.The nearby nighttime observatory,  [[Apache Point Observatory]], is not open to the public.

== Telescopes operated by the observatory ==

* See [[Sunspot Solar Observatory]] for the telescopes located there
* See [[Apache Point Observatory]] for the telescopes located there

=== Kitt Peak ===
* [[McMath-Pierce Solar Telescope]]
* [[Kitt Peak Solis Telescope]]

=== Global ===
* [[Global Oscillation Network Group]]

== History==
The Sacramento Peak facilities are located in [[Sunspot, New Mexico]]. The site's name was chosen by the late [[James C. Sadler]], (1920–2005), an internationally noted [[meteorologist]] and professor at The [[University of Hawaii]], formerly with the [[United States Air Force]] on assignment during the early inception of the observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |title=The Sacramento Peak Observatory |work=Solar Physics |issue=182 |pages=1-19 |year=1998 |first=J. B.|last=Zirker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Solar eclipse of August 21, 2017]], NSO enlisted the cooperation of various groups in the Citizen CATE (Continental-America Telescopic Eclipse)  experiment to set up more than 60 identical telescopes along the eclipse path, to produce 90 continuous minutes of images, 10 seconds apart, of the Sun's inner [[corona]]. This was to provide a clearer understanding of solar plumes and other transient phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-solar-eclipse-usa-projects/citizen-scientists-will-take-to-the-field-for-u-s-eclipse-idUSKCN1AX100|title=Citizen scientists will take to the field for U.S. eclipse|last=Klotz|first=Irene|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Punctuation marks|※|caption=reference mark}}

A '''note''' is a string of text placed at the bottom of a [[page (paper)|page]] in a book or document or at the end of a chapter, volume or the whole text.  The note can provide an author's comments on the main text or [[citation]]s of a reference work in support of the text, or both.

'''Footnotes''' are notes at the foot of the page while '''endnotes''' are collected under a separate heading at the end of a chapter, volume, or entire work.  Unlike footnotes, endnotes have the advantage of not affecting the layout of the main text, but may cause inconvenience to readers who have to move back and forth between the main text and the endnotes.

In some editions of the Bible, notes are placed in a narrow column in the middle of each page between two columns of biblical text.

== Numbering and symbols==

In English, a footnote is normally flagged by a [[superscript]]ed number immediately following that portion of the text the note references, each such footnote being numbered sequentially. Occasionally a number between brackets or parentheses is used instead, thus: [1], which can also be superscripted, as in Wikipedia's own citation style rendered within this very page.

Typographical devices such as the [[asterisk]] (*) or [[dagger (typography)|dagger]] (†) may also be used to point to footnotes; the traditional order of these symbols in English is [[Asterisk|*]], [[Dagger (typography)|†]], [[Double dagger (typography)|‡]], [[Section sign|§]], [[Vertical Bar|‖]], [[Pilcrow|¶]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bringhurst (2005).  ''The Elements of Typographic Style'' (version 3.1).  Point Roberts, WA: Hartley and Marks. pp 68–69.  Bringhurst goes on to say “But beyond the ... double dagger, this order is not familiar to most readers, and never was.”&lt;/ref&gt;  Other symbols, including the [[Number Sign|#]], [[Delta (letter)|Δ]], [[Lozenge|◊]], [[Arrow (symbol)|↓]], and [[Index (typography)|☞]], have also been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livesandletters.ac.uk/papers/FOR_2005_04_001.pdf|author=William H. Sherman|title=Toward a History of the Manicule|accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Many of these symbols are used, for example, in [[John Bach McMaster]], ''History of the People of the United States''&lt;/ref&gt; In documents like [[Public transport timetable|timetables]], many different symbols, letters and numbers may be used to refer the reader to particular notes.

== Academic usage==
Notes are most often used as an alternative to long explanatory notes that can be distracting to readers. Most literary style guidelines (including the [[Modern Language Association]] and the [[American Psychological Association]]) recommend limited use of foot and endnotes. However, publishers often encourage note references in lieu of parenthetical references. Aside from use as a bibliographic element, notes are used for additional information or explanatory notes that might be too digressive for the main text. Footnotes are heavily utilized in academic institutions to support claims made in academic essays covering myriads of topics.

In particular, footnotes are the normal form of citation in historical journals. This is due, firstly, to the fact that the most important references are often to archive sources or interviews which do not readily fit standard formats, and secondly, to the fact that historians expect to see the exact nature of the evidence which is being used at each stage.

The MLA (Modern Language Association) requires the superscript numbers in the main text to be placed following the punctuation in the phrase or clause the note is in reference to. The exception to this rule occurs when a sentence contains a dash, in which case the superscript would precede it.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Aside from their technical use, authors use notes for a variety of reasons:
* As signposts to direct the reader to information the author has provided or where further useful information is pertaining to the subject in the main text.
* To attribute a quote or viewpoint.
* As an alternative to parenthetical references; it is a simpler way to acknowledge information gained from another source.
* To escape the limitations imposed on the [[word count]] of various academic and legal texts which do not take into account notes. Aggressive use of this strategy can lead to a text affected by "foot and note disease" (a derogation coined by [[John Betjeman]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogers|first=Timothy|title=Rupert Brooke: Man and Monument|journal=English|year=1968|volume=17|issue=99|pages=79–84|url=http://english.oxfordjournals.org/content/17/99/79.full.pdf|accessdate=21 March 2011|doi=10.1093/english/17.99.79}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

''The Independent'', Thursday 27 April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government documents==
The [[US Government Printing Office]] Style Manual devotes over 660 words to the topic of footnotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chapter 15: Footnotes, indexes, contents, and outlines | work=U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual | url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008/html/GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008-17.htm | accessdate=October 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NASA]] has guidance for footnote usage in its historical documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=A Guide to Footnotes and Endnotes for NASA History Authors | work=NASA History Style Guide | url=https://history.nasa.gov/footnoteguide.html | accessdate=March 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal writing==
Associate Justice [[Stephen Breyer]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] is famous in the American legal community for his writing style, in which he never uses notes. He prefers to keep all citations within the text (which is permitted in American legal citation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=In Justice Breyer's Opinion, A Footnote Has No Place | date=1995-07-28 | publisher= | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE1DC163EF93BA15754C0A963958260 | work =[[The New York Times]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-04-30 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard A. Posner]] has also written against the use of notes in judicial opinions.&lt;ref name=Posner2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Posner|first1=Richard A.|title=Against Footnotes|journal=Court Review|date=Summer 2001|url=http://aja.ncsc.dni.us/courtrv/cr38-2/CR38-2Posner.pdf|accessdate=2014-10-13|publisher=American Judges Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bryan A. Garner]], however, advocates using notes instead of inline citations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oddi |first=Marcia |url=http://indianalawblog.com/archives/2005/01/indiana_courts_99.html |title=Indiana Courts - Footnotes in Judicial Opinions |publisher=The Indiana Law Blog |date=2005-01-07 |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==HTML==
[[HTML]], the predominant [[markup language]] for web pages, has no mechanism for marking up notes. Despite a number of different proposals over the years, and repeated pleas from the user base, the [[working group]] has been unable to reach a consensus on it. Because of this, [[MediaWiki]], for example, has had to introduce its own &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag for citing references in notes, an idea which has since also been implemented for generic use by the ''[[Nelson (HTML preprocessor)|Nelson]]'' HTML preprocessor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Nelson HTML Preprocessor | url=http://nelsonhtml.com | accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It might be argued that the [[hyperlink]] partially eliminates the need for notes, being the web's way to refer to another document. However, it does not allow citing to offline sources and if the destination of the link changes, the link can become dead or irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jill Lepore]]. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20150125141230/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb The Cobweb]", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', 26 January 2015 issue. Retrieved 25 January 2015. Archived from [http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/01/26/cobweb the original].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The sign is historically equal to the [[asterisks]] used by [[Aristarchus of Samothrace]] at the [[Musaeum|Mouseion at Alexandria]]. It was used for the critical editions of Homer's writings where it "marked a verse incorrectly repeated in another passage" and was used together with other signs such as the [[obelus]].&lt;ref&gt;L.D. Reynolds and N.G. Wilson. Scribes and Scholars: A guide to the Transmission of Greek and Latin Literature. Oxford University Press, 1991, 3rd edition, {{ISBN|0-19-872146-3}}, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The London printer [[Richard Jugge]] is generally credited as the inventor of the footnote, first used in the [[Bishops' Bible]] of 1568.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Zerby, ''The Devil's Details: A History of Footnotes'', 2007, {{ISBN|1931229058}}, p. 28 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

Early printings of the Douay Bible used two closely spaced colons (actually squared four dot punctuation mark U+2E2C) to indicate a marginal note.

==Literary device==
At times, notes have been used for their comical effect, or as a literary device.

* [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' uses footnotes along with left and right marginal notes in Book II Chapter 2. The three types of notes represent comments from the three siblings doing their homework: Shem, Shaun, and Issy.
* [[J.G. Ballard]]'s  "Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown," is one sentence ("A discharged Broadmoor patient compiles 'Notes Towards a Mental Breakdown,' recalling his wife's murder, his trial and exoneration.") and a series of elaborate footnotes to each one of the words.
*[[Mark Z. Danielewski]]'s ''[[House of Leaves]]'' uses what are arguably some of the most extensive and intricate footnotes in literature. Throughout the novel, footnotes are used to tell several different narratives outside of the main story. The physical orientation of the footnotes on the page also works to reflect the twisted feeling of the plot (often taking up several pages, appearing mirrored from page to page, vertical on either side of the page, or in boxes in the center of the page, in the middle of the central narrative).
* [[Flann O'Brien]]'s ''[[The Third Policeman]]'' utilizes extensive and lengthy footnotes for the discussion of a fictional philosopher, [[de Selby]]. These footnotes span several pages and often overtake the main plotline, and add to the absurdist tone of the book.
* [[David Foster Wallace]]'s ''[[Infinite Jest]]'' includes over 400 endnotes, some over a dozen pages long. Several literary critics suggested that the book be read with two bookmarks.  Wallace uses footnotes, endnotes, and in-text notes in much of his other writing as well.
*[[Manuel Puig]]'s ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' (originally published in Spanish as ''El beso de la mujer araña'') also makes extensive use of footnotes.
*[[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[Lake Wobegon Days]]'' includes lengthy footnotes and a parallel narrative.
*[[Mark Dunn]]'s ''[[Ibid: A Life]]'' is written entirely in endnotes.
*[[Luis d'Antin van Rooten]]'s ''[[Mots d'Heures: Gousses, Rames]]'' (the title is in [[French language|French]], but when pronounced, sounds similar to the [[English language|English]] ''"Mother Goose Rhymes"''), in which he is allegedly the editor of a manuscript by the fictional François Charles Fernand d’Antin, contains copious footnotes purporting to help explain the nonsensical French text. The point of the book is that each written French poem ''sounds'' like an English [[nursery rhyme]].
*[[Terry Pratchett]] has made numerous uses within his novels. The footnotes will often set up running jokes for the rest of the novel.
*[[B.L.A.]] and [[G.B. Gabbler]]'s meta novel ''[[The Automation]]'' makes uses of footnotes to break the [[fourth wall]]. The narrator of the novel, known as "B.L.A.," tells the fantastical story as if true, while the editor, Gabbler, annotates the story through footnotes and thinks the manuscript is only a [[prose poem]] attempting to be a literary masterwork.
*[[Susanna Clarke]]'s ''[[Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrell]]'' uses dozens of footnotes referencing a number of fictional books including magical scholarship and biographies.
*[[Jonathan Stroud]]'s ''[[The Bartimaeus Trilogy]]'' uses footnotes to insert comical remarks and explanations by one of the protagonists, Bartimaeus.
*[[Michael Gerber (parodist)|Michael Gerber]]'s ''[[Barry Trotter]]'' parody series used footnotes to expand [[one-line joke]]s in the text into paragraph-long comedic monologues that would otherwise break the flow of the narrative.
*[[John Green (author)|John Green]]'s ''[[An Abundance of Katherines]]'' uses footnotes in which he says: "[They] can allow you to create a kind of secret second narrative, which is important if, say, you're writing a book about what a story is and whether stories are significant."{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}
* Dr Carol Bolton uses extensive footnotes to provide the modern reader with a cipher for a novel about the travels of the fictional Spanish traveller [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275996974_Through_Spanish_Eyes_Robert_Southey's_Double_Vision_in_Letters_from_England_By_Don_Manuel_Alvarez_Espriella_%281807%29 Don Manuel Alvarez Espriella], an early 19th-century construct of Robert Southey's, designed to provide him with vehicle to critique the societal habits of the day.
*[[Jasper Fforde]]'s ''[[Thursday Next]]'' series exploits the use of footnotes as a communication device (the ''footnoterphone'') which allows communication between the main character’s universe and the fictional bookworld.
*[[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[Natural History of the Dead]]'' uses a footnote to further satirize the style of a history while making a sardonic statement about the extinction of "humanists" in modern society.
*[[Pierre Bayle]]'s ''[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique|Historical and Critical Dictionary]]'' follows each brief entry with a footnote (often five or six times the length of the main text) in which saints, historical figures, and other topics are used as examples for philosophical digression.  The separate footnotes are designed to contradict each other, and only when multiple footnotes are read together is Bayle's core argument for [[Fideism|Fideistic skepticism]] revealed.  This technique was used in part to evade the harsh censorship of 17th century France.
*[[Mordecai Richler]]'s novel ''[[Barney's Version (novel)|Barney's Version]]'' uses footnotes as a character device that highlights unreliable passages in the narration. As the editor of his father's autobiography, the narrator's son must correct any of his father's misstated facts. The frequency of these corrections increases as the father falls victim to both hubris and [[Alzheimer's disease]]. While most of these changes are minor, a few are essential to plot and character development.
*In [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Pale Fire]]'', the main plot is told through the annotative endnotes of a fictional editor.
*''[[Bartleby y Compañía]],'' a novel by [[Enrique Vila-Matas]], is stylized as footnotes to a nonexistent novel.
*The works of [[Jack Vance]] often have footnotes, detailing and informing the reader of the background of the world in the novel.
*[[Stephen Colbert]]'s ''[[I Am America (And So Can You!)]]'' uses both footnotes and margin notes to offer additional commentary and humor.
*[[Doug Dorst]]'s novel ''[[S. (Dorst novel)|S.]]'' uses footnotes to explore the story and relationship of characters V.M. Straka and F.X. Caldeira.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4581">[[Image:Our Whole Lives.jpg|thumb|The Our Whole Lives logo.]]'''Our Whole Lives''', or '''OWL''', is a series of six comprehensive [[Sexual education|sexuality curricula]] for children, [[teenagers]], young adults and [[adults]] published by the [[Unitarian Universalist Association]] and the [[United Church of Christ]] [[Justice and Witness Ministries]].&lt;ref&gt;Unitarian Universalist Association Our Whole Lives pages (http://www.uua.org/re/owl). Retrieved on 2007 May 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Church of Christ Our Whole Lives pages (http://www.ucc.org/justice/sexuality_education/our-whole-lives.html). Retrieved on 2007 November 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Publication was the result of seven years of collaborative effort by the two faiths to prepare material which addresses sexuality throughout the lifespan in [[age appropriate]] ways.

The Our Whole Lives program operates under the idea that well informed [[youth]] and young adults make better, healthier decisions about [[human sexuality|sexuality]] than those without complete information. OWL strives to be unbiased and teaches about [[heterosexual]], [[bisexual]], [[homosexual]], and [[transgender]] [[sexual health]]. In addition to information on sex, OWL is intended to help children, youth, and adults to be emotionally healthy and responsible in terms of their sexuality.

==Program structure==
There are four OWL curricula designed for the American school grades of K–1, 4–6, 7–9, 10–12, plus one for young adults (18- to 35-year-olds) and one for adults.

Each session of the Our Whole Lives curriculum can include the "Sexuality and Our Faith" companion, which comes in separate versions, one for the [[Unitarian Universalist Association|UUA]] and [[Canadian Unitarian Council|CUC]] communities and another one for the [[United Church of Christ|UCC]] community. Without "Sexuality and Our Faith," the programs have no religious material and are thus appropriate for use in schools and other non-religious institutions.

==Program values==
Our Whole Lives is built upon four core values:
# Self Worth
# Sexual Health
# Responsibility
# Justice and Inclusivity.

Participants are encouraged to use these values in decision-making concerning their own sexuality and relationships.  Throughout the program, participants are encouraged to explore and learn to articulate their own values.

==Program leaders==
Our Whole Lives classes are led by teams of facilitators recruited from within their congregations.  Before leading Our Whole Lives, facilitators must complete a training program led by certified trainers of trainers.  Training is intensive and focused on building the facilitation skills demanded by Our Whole Lives. In addition to exploring the core values and pedagogical theory underlying Our Whole Lives, trainings include opportunities to peer-facilitate a session, giving future leaders hands-on experience.  At the end of the training (which is approximately 20 hours of training over three days), facilitators must be certified by their trainers before leading Our Whole Lives in their congregations.  

Facilitators for Our Whole Lives work in teams of at least two – one male and one female – for each class.  The gender balance allows participants to feel comfortable raising concerns, questions and issues with their trainers.  For the middle school (grades 7-9) curriculum, some activities are done in gender segregated groups, otherwise all activities take place in mixed gender groups.  Leaders for Our Whole Lives are expected to model the program values - treating participants with respect and honoring their moral agency.

In Unitarian Universalist congregations the grades 7–9 OWL curriculum replaced the somewhat controversial [[About Your Sexuality]], which went out of print in the 1990s.

An '''output signal switching device''' (or '''OSSD''') is the interface of a sensor designed for reliably signalling a safety-related event, usually the crossing of an immaterial barrier.

The technology relies on two independent channels carrying the same information output by the device:

* Idle signal is 24 V, periodically shortly pulsed to 0 V (pulses are not synchronous) in order for the receiver to ensure no shortcut to either 0 V or 24 V.
* Active signal is issued when both lines present 0 V; a single line presenting 0 V for a duration longer than the test pulses is sufficient to signal an event.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1780">The '''Parchments of Awraman''' are three [[parchment]] documents, found in 1909 in a cave in the [[Hawraman]] region of Iranian [[Kurdistan]]. They were found in Tang-i Var, Kuh-e Salan Mountain, near the village of Shahr Hawraman. The documents were found in a sealed jar by a villager, and then sent to London in October 1913.&lt;ref name=SOAS&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edmonds|first1=C.

{{merge into|Equatorial coordinate system|date=July 2018}}
[[File:Ra and dec demo animation small.gif|thumb|The [[equatorial coordinate system]] on the [[celestial sphere]]]]

'''Star position''' is the apparent location of any given [[star]] in the [[sky]], which seems [[fixed stars|fixed]] onto an [[celestial sphere|arbitrary sphere]] centered on [[Earth]]. The location is defined by a pair of [[celestial coordinate system|angular coordinates]] relative to the [[celestial equator]]: [[right ascension]] (''α'') and [[declination]] (''δ''). This pair based the [[equatorial coordinate system]].

While ''δ'' is given in [[degree (angle)|degrees]] (from +90° at the north [[celestial pole]] to −90° at the south), ''α'' is usually given in [[hour angle]]s (0 to 24 h). This is due to the observation technique of [[star transit]]s, which [[diurnal motion|cross]] the [[field of view]] of telescope [[eyepiece]]s due to [[Earth's rotation]]. The observation techniques are topics of [[positional astronomy]] and of [[astrogeodesy]].

Ideally, the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] (''α'', ''δ'') refers to an [[inertial frame of reference]]. The [[spherical coordinate system|third coordinate]] is the star's [[distance]], which is normally used as an attribute of the individual star.

The following factors change star positions over time:
#[[axial precession]] and [[nutation]] – slow [[axial tilt|tilts]] of Earth's axis with rates of 50 arcseconds and 2 arcseconds respectively, per year;
#the [[aberration of light|aberration]] and [[parallax]] – effects of [[Earth's orbit]] around the Sun; and
#the [[proper motion]] of the individual stars.

The first and second effects are considered by so-called '''mean places of stars''', contrary to their [[apparent place]]s as seen from the moving Earth. Usually the mean places refer to a special [[Epoch (astronomy)|epoch]], e.g. 1950.0 or [[2000.0]]. The third effect has to be handled individually.

The star positions ''α, δ'' are compiled in several [[star catalogue]]s of different volume and accuracy. ''Absolute'' and very precise coordinates of 1000-3000 stars are collected in [[fundamental catalogue]]s, starting with the FK (Berlin ~1890) up to the modern [[FK6]].

''Relative'' coordinates of numerous stars are collected in catalogues like the [[Bonner Durchmusterung]] (Germany 1852-1862, 200.000 rough positions), the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Star Catalog|SAO]] catalogue (USA 1966, 250.000 astrometric stars) or the [[Hipparcos]] and Tycho catalogue (110.000 and 2 million stars by space astrometry).

==History==
TMTC is housed in a gracious heritage structure, designed by renowned architect [[George Wittet]], on rambling grounds surrounded by leafy trees, lawns, pathways and flower beds. The 15 acres of land on which TMTC stands once belonged to leading solicitor F. E. Dinshaw. In 1918, Mr. Dinshaw acquired the services of Mr. Wittet, the then consulting architect to the Government of Bombay, to build him a country home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title = The centre
|work = tmtctata.com
| accessdate = 27 November 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, it was restored and turned it into a residential training centre though the original layout remains the same.
The institute can house 60 people at its residential facilities, with two lecture halls and two seminar rooms. It also has a library of management books, journals and films. Along with its facilities for training and living, TMTC has facilities for indoor and outdoor sports.

Its facilities have been utilised by other specialised training institutes, including the [[Indian Institutes of Management]] (Ahmedabad and Calcutta), the [[Administrative Staff College of India]](Hyderabad), the All India Management Association and the Indian Society for Applied Behavioural Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''''The Emperor's New Drugs – Exploding the Antidepressant Myth''''' is a 2009 book by [[Irving Kirsch]], arguing that the [[chemical imbalance theory]] of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] is wrong and that [[antidepressants]] have little or no direct effect on depression but, because of their common serious side-effects, they are a powerful [[placebo]].&lt;ref name="Kirsch2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irving Kirsch|title=The Emperor's New Drugs: Exploding the Antidepressant Myth|date=13 October 2009|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4090-8635-2|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argument==
While analyzing antidepressant trials as part of his research into the [[placebo]] effect, Kirsch realised that drug companies do not publish all of their disappointing antidepressant trial results, but most decisions about the efficacy of an antidepressant are based only on published results. Using the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]], he and his colleagues acquired from the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] the unpublished trial results for six antidepressants. When the results from both published and unpublished studies were averaged, the researchers concluded that the drugs produced a small but [[Clinical significance|clinically meaningless]] improvement in mood compared with an inert placebo (sugar pill).&lt;ref name=Medscape/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kirsch2002&gt;{{cite journal|title= The emperor's new drugs: An analysis of antidepressant medication data submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration|author1=Kirsch, Irving |author2=Moore, Thomas J. |author3=Scoboria, Alan |author4=Nicholls, Sarah S |journal=Prevention &amp; Treatment|volume=5|issue=1|date= Jul 2002|doi= 10.1037/1522-3736.5.1.523a}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Some researchers have questioned the statistical basis of this study suggesting that it underestimates the effect size of antidepressants&lt;ref name="HORDER2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Horder J, Matthews P, Waldmann R | title = Placebo, Prozac and PLoS: significant lessons for psychopharmacology | journal = Journal of Psychopharmacology (Oxford, England) | volume = 25 | issue = 10 | pages = 1277–88 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20571143 | doi = 10.1177/0269881110372544 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FOUNTOULAKIS2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fountoulakis KN, Möller HJ | title = Efficacy of antidepressants: a re-analysis and re-interpretation of the Kirsch data | journal = The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 1–8 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20800012 | doi = 10.1017/S1461145710000957 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other studies have reached a range of supporting and conflicting conclusions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gibbons RD, Hur K, Brown CH, Davis JM, Mann JJ | title = Benefits from antidepressants: synthesis of 6-week patient-level outcomes from double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trials of fluoxetine and venlafaxine | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | volume = 69 | issue = 6 | pages = 572–9 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22393205 | pmc = 3371295 | doi = 10.1001/archgenpsychiatry.2011.2044 | url =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Fournier JC, DeRubeis RJ, Hollon SD, etal |title=Antidepressant drug effects and depression severity: a patient-level meta-analysis |journal=JAMA |volume=303 |issue=1 |pages=47–53 |date=January 2010  |pmid=20051569 |pmc=3712503 |doi=10.1001/jama.2009.1943 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To determine whether their averaging of results was hiding a meaningful benefit to more-severely depressed patients by combining their results with those of moderately and mildly depressed patients, he and his colleagues undertook another study, this time of the four new-generation antidepressants for which all (published and unpublished) trial data were available, and concluded that the difference between drug and placebo effect was greater for more-severely depressed patients, and that this difference was clinically meaningful (but still relatively small) only at the upper end of the very severely depressed category.

Kirsch also addresses the conclusions of the [[STAR*D|a 2004 study]], that if one antidepressant doesn't work on a patient, another should be tried in its place, and then another, until hopefully one will be found to be effective.

If the anti-nausea drug failed to prevent nausea, they were given another. If that failed, another was tried; and so on.

Since the [[Psychopharmacology revolution#Theory of mood disorders|chemical-imbalance theory of depression]] is based on the efficacy of antidepressants, Kirsch concludes, "It now seems beyond question that the traditional account of depression as a chemical imbalance in the brain is simply wrong."&lt;ref name=Menand/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirsch80"&gt;{{cite book|author=Irving Kirsch|title=The Emperor's New Drugs: Exploding the Antidepressant Myth|url=|date=13 October 2009|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4090-8635-2|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and impact==
The European Psychiatric Association published a position paper in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Möller HJ, Bitter I, Bobes J, Fountoulakis K, Höschl C, Kasper S |title=Position statement of the European Psychiatric Association (EPA) on the value of antidepressants in the treatment of unipolar depression |journal=Eur. Psychiatry |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=114–28 |year=2012 |pmid=22119161 |doi=10.1016/j.eurpsy.2011.08.002 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924933811001398}}&lt;/ref&gt; that described Kirsch's argument as "misleading".  The organization argues that 
* The mathematical treatment of the data was flawed and underestimates the efficacy of antidepressants; 
* The analysis incorrectly focuses on mean differences between groups and ignores important subgroup effects; 
* The size effect cutoff of 0.50 is arbitrary and not demonstrated to be clinically meaningful; 
* That efficacy measured by the 15-20% difference between placebo and active antidepressant treatment in rate of remission corresponds to moderate to strong efficacy in evidence-based medicine analyses, and 
* Kirsch's analysis disregards the results of double-blind, placebo controlled maintenance studies that show highly statistical effects on the rate of relapse for those treated with antidepressants relative to those receiving placebo

[[Marcia Angell]]'s review of The Emperor's New Drugs welcomes Kirsch's work as a long overdue application of the scientific method to a field lacking rigorous scientific analysis, stating "Kirsch is a faithful proponent of the scientific method, and his voice therefore brings a welcome objectivity to a subject often swayed by anecdotes, emotions, or, as we will see, self-interest."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2011/06/23/epidemic-mental-illness-why/ |title=The Epidemic of Mental Illness: Why? |last=Angell |first=Marcia |website=[[New York Review of Books]] |publication-date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Daniel Carlat]] called the book "an important book, with the reservation that Kirsch’s selective use of data gives him the appearance of an anti-antidepressant partisan."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Book Review: The Emperor’s New Drugs: Exploding the Antidepressant Myth. Irving Kirsch Basic Books; 2010. | pmc=3001545 | page=E873 | volume=182 | issue=18 | journal=CMAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He states that Irving's conclusions are "provocative but unconvincing", noting that many drugs such as benzodiazepines have been tested for antidepressant activity and found inactive.  Carlat argues that if antidepressants were acting purely via a placebo effect, any benzodiazepines and other drugs would show activity as well.

In a 2012 episode of [[CBS]]'s ''[[60 Minutes]]'' featuring Kirsch and his book, host [[Lesley Stahl]] said, "The medical community is at war – battling over the scientific research and writings of a psychologist named Irving Kirsch ... Kirsch and his studies have triggered a furious counterattack, mainly from psychiatrists."&lt;ref name=CBS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/news/treating-depression-is-there-a-placebo-effect/|title=Treating Depression: Is there a Placebo Effect? |date=19 February 2012 |website= CBS, 60 Minutes |publisher= |accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the program's airing, [[Jeffrey Lieberman]], the American Psychiatric Association's president elect at the time, said, "Dr. Kirsch is mistaken and confused, and he's ideologically biased in his thinking. He is conducting an analysis and interpreting the data to support his ideologically biased perspective.  What he is concluding is inaccurate, and what he is communicating is misleading to people and potentially harmful to those who really suffer from depression and would be expected to benefit from antidepressant medication. To say that antidepressants are no better than placebo is just plain wrong." &lt;ref name=Medscape&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/760569 |author= Fran Lowry|title=APA Blasts 60 Minutes Program on Antidepressants |date=20 March 2012 |accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8765">A '''theoretical plate''' in many [[separation process]]es is a hypothetical zone or stage in which two phases, such as the liquid and vapor phases of a substance, establish an [[Vapor–liquid equilibrium|equilibrium]] with each other. Such equilibrium stages may also be referred to as an '''equilibrium stage''', '''ideal stage''', or a '''theoretical tray'''. The performance of many separation processes depends on having series of equilibrium stages and is enhanced by providing more such stages. In other words, having more theoretical plates increases the efficiency of the separation process be it either a [[distillation]], [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]], [[chromatography|chromatographic]], [[adsorption]] or similar process.&lt;ref name=Towler&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gavin Towler  |author2=R K Sinnott |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Chemical Engineering Design: Principles, Practice and Economics of Plant and Process Design| edition= | publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2007|isbn=0-7506-8423-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kister&gt;{{cite book|author=Kister, H.Z.|title= [[Distillation Design]]|edition=1st |publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1992|isbn=0-07-034909-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

The concept of theoretical plates and trays or equilibrium stages is used in the design of many different types of separation.&lt;ref name=Towler/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kister/&gt;

===Distillation columns===

The concept of theoretical plates in designing [[distillation]] processes has been discussed in many reference texts.&lt;ref name=Kister/&gt;&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;{{cite book|author1=Perry, Robert H.  |author2=Green, Don W. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=[[Perry's Chemical Engineers' Handbook]]|edition=6th| publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984|isbn=0-07-049479-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any physical device that provides good contact between the vapor and liquid phases present in industrial-scale [[fractionating column|distillation columns]] or laboratory-scale glassware distillation columns constitutes a "plate" or "tray". Since an actual, physical plate can never be a 100% efficient equilibrium stage, the number of actual plates is more than the required theoretical plates.

: &lt;math&gt;N_a = \frac{N_t}{E}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_a&lt;/math&gt; is the number of actual, physical plates or trays, &lt;math&gt;N_t&lt;/math&gt; is the number of theoretical plates or trays and &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is the plate or tray efficiency.

So-called bubble-cap or valve-cap trays are examples of the vapor and liquid contact devices used in industrial distillation columns. Another example of vapor and liquid contact devices are the spikes in laboratory [[Vigreux column|Vigreux fractionating columns]].

The trays or plates  used in industrial distillation columns are fabricated of circular steel plates and usually installed inside the column at intervals of about 60 to 75&amp;nbsp;cm (24 to 30 inches) up the height of the column. That spacing is chosen primarily for ease of installation and ease of access for future repair or maintenance. 
[[Image:Bubble Cap Trays.PNG|frame|right|Typical bubble cap trays used in industrial distillation columns]]
An example of a very simple tray is a perforated tray. The desired contacting between vapor and liquid occurs as the vapor, flowing upwards through the perforations, comes into contact with the liquid flowing downwards through the perforations.  In current modern practice, as shown in the adjacent diagram, better contacting is achieved by installing bubble-caps or valve caps at each perforation to promote the formation of vapor bubbles flowing through a thin layer of liquid maintained by a [[weir]] on each tray.

To design a distillation unit or a similar chemical process, the number of theoretical trays or plates (that is, hypothetical equilibrium stages), {{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}}, required in the process should be determined, taking into account a likely range of feedstock composition and the desired degree of separation of the components in the output fractions.  In industrial continuous fractionating columns, {{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}} is determined by starting at either the top or bottom of the column and calculating material balances, heat balances and [[Flash evaporation|equilibrium flash vaporization]]s for each of the succession of equilibrium stages until the desired end product composition is achieved.  The calculation process requires the availability of a great deal of [[vapor–liquid equilibrium]] data for the components present in the distillation feed, and the calculation procedure is very complex.&lt;ref name=Kister/&gt;&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt;

In an industrial distillation column, the {{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}} required to achieve a given separation also depends upon the amount of [[reflux]] used.  Using more reflux decreases the number of plates required and using less reflux increases the number of plates required. Hence, the calculation of {{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}} is usually repeated at various reflux rates.  {{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}} is then divided by the tray efficiency, E, to determine the actual number of trays or physical plates, {{mvar|N&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;}}, needed in the separating column.  The final design choice of the number of trays to be installed in an industrial distillation column is then selected based upon an economic balance between the cost of additional trays and the cost of using a higher reflux rate.

There is a very important distinction between the theoretical plate terminology used in discussing conventional distillation trays and the theoretical plate terminology used in the discussions below of packed bed distillation or absorption or in chromatography or other applications. '''The theoretical plate in conventional distillation trays has no "height"'''. It is simply a hypothetical equilibrium stage. However, the theoretical plate in packed beds, chromatography and other applications is defined as having a height.

===Distillation and absorption packed beds===

Distillation  and [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] separation processes using [[packed bed]]s for vapor and liquid contacting have an equivalent concept referred to as the '''plate height''' or the '''height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP).'''&lt;ref name=Kister/&gt;&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt;  '''HETP''' arises from the same concept of equilibrium stages as does the theoretical plate and is numerically equal to the absorption bed length divided by the number of theoretical plates in the absorption bed (and in practice is measured in this way).

: &lt;math&gt;N_t = \frac{H}\mathrm{HETP}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_t&lt;/math&gt; is the number of theoretical plates (also called the "plate count"), {{mvar|H}} is the total bed height and {{math|HETP}} is the height equivalent to a theoretical plate.

The material in packed beds can either be random dumped packing (1-3" wide) such as [[Raschig ring]]s or [[Structured packing|structured sheet metal]]. Liquids tend to wet the surface of the packing and the vapors contact the wetted surface, where [[mass transfer]] occurs.

===Chromatographic processes===

The theoretical plate concept was also adapted for [[chromatography|chromatographic]] processes by [[Archer John Porter Martin|Martin]] and [[Richard Laurence Millington Synge|Synge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martin |first1=A.J.P. |last2=Synge |first2=R.L.M. |title=A new form of chromatogram employing two liquid phases |journal=Biochemical Journal |date=1941 |volume=35 |issue=12 |pages=1358–1368}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[IUPAC]]'s [[Gold Book]] provides a definition of the number of theoretical plates in a chromatography column.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/goldbook/P04694.html Definition of the number of plates (in chromatography)] IUPAC Gold Book&lt;/ref&gt;

The same equation applies in chromatography processes as for the packed bed processes, namely:

: &lt;math&gt;N_t = \frac{H}\mathrm{HETP}&lt;/math&gt;

In chromatography, the HETP may also be calculated with the [[Van Deemter equation]].

===Other applications===

The concept of theoretical plates or trays applies to other processes as well, such as [[capillary electrophoresis]] and some types of [[adsorption]].

The '''UC Berkeley School of Information''' or the '''I School''' is a graduate school offering three degree programs: a professional master's degree in information management (MIMS), a professional master's degree in data science (MIDS), and an academic doctoral degree. Created in 1994, the I School is UC Berkeley's newest school. It was previously known as the School of Information Management and Systems (SIMS) until 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/about&lt;/ref&gt; Its roots trace back to UC Berkeley's School of Librarianship founded in the 1920s. The program is located in UC Berkeley's [[South Hall (UC Berkeley)|South Hall]], near [[Sather Tower]] in the center of the [[UC Berkeley]] campus.

==Curriculum==

===MIMS program===
