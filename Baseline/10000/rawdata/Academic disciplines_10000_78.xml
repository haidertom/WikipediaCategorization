'''A-not-B error''' (also known as "stage 4 error" or "perseverative error") is a phenomenon uncovered by the work of [[Jean Piaget]] in his [[theory of cognitive development]] of children. The A-not-B error is a particular error made by infants during substage 4 of their [[sensorimotor stage]]. 

A typical A-not-B task goes like this: An experimenter hides an attractive toy under box "A" within the baby's reach. The baby searches for the toy, looks under box "A", and finds the toy. This activity is usually repeated several times (always with the researcher hiding the toy under box "A"). Then, in the critical trial, the experimenter moves the toy under box "B", also within easy reach of the baby. Babies of 10 months or younger typically make the [[perseveration]] error, meaning they look under box "A" even though they saw the researcher move the toy under box "B", and box "B" is just as easy to reach. This demonstrates a lack of, or incomplete, [[schema (psychology)|schema]] of [[object permanence]]. Children of 12 months or older typically do not make this error.

==Competing explanations==
Traditionally, this phenomenon has been explained as the child seeing an image and remembering where it was, rather than where it is. Other accounts deal with the development of planning, reaching, and deciding things. There are also [[behaviorist]] accounts that explain the behavior in terms of reinforcement. This account argues that the repeated trials with hiding the toy in box "A" is reinforcing that specific behavior, so that the child still reaches for box "A" because the action has been reinforced before. However, this account does not explain the shift in behavior that occurs around 12 months.

Smith and Thelen&lt;ref name=ST&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00156-6|pmid=12907229|title=Development as a dynamic system|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=7|issue=8|pages=343–348|year=2003|last1=Smith|first1=Linda B.|last2=Thelen|first2=Esther}}&lt;/ref&gt; used a [[Cognitive model#Cognitive development| dynamic systems]] approach to the A-not-B task. They found that various components of the activity (strength of memory trace, salience of targets, waiting time, stance) combine in the "B"-trial (where the object is hidden in the "B" location rather than "A") so the child either correctly or incorrectly searches for the toy. They experimentally manipulated the task to see if they could make 10-month-old babies (who typically make the perseverative error of searching at "A") perform like 12-month-old babies (who typically search correctly). Changing the stance of the baby (sitting or standing) was one manipulation they found could make the 10-month-old search correctly. Just standing instead of sitting for the "B"-trial made the prior experience of searching in location "A" less salient to the child, who then searched correctly. The researchers concluded that the length of wait time was one of the crucial elements of the task that is influenced by age.

'''Adaptive tile refresh''' is a [[computer graphics]] technique for [[side-scrolling video game]]s. It was most famously used by [[id Software]]'s [[John D. Carmack|John Carmack]] in games such as ''[[Commander Keen]]'' to compensate for the poor graphics performance of PCs in the early 1990s. Its principal innovation is a novel use of several [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] hardware features to perform the scrolling in hardware. The technique is named for its other aspect, the tracking of moved graphical elements in order to minimize the amount of redrawing required in every frame. Together, the combination saves the processing time that would be otherwise required for redrawing the entire screen.&lt;ref name="Masters of Doom"/&gt;{{rp|50}} Carmack designed the software engine based on a scrolling display for large images from the 1970s.&lt;ref name="CK-IEEE"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Video Game Software Wizardry of Id | date=August 1, 2002 | first=David | last=Kushner | publisher=IEEE Spectrum | url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/consumer-electronics/gaming/the-video-game-software-wizardry-of-id | accessdate=April 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] (the previous generation of PC graphics hardware) lacks features for scrolling in hardware, scrolling previously had to be done in software, by redrawing the entire screen for every frame – a task that PCs of the time lack the performance to carry out. Adaptive tile refresh minimizes the computing power required for sidescrolling games to within the reach of available hardware. This works by flagging bitmap tiles and redrawing only the graphics on the screen that actually update.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aycock |first1=John |title=Retrogame Archeology: Exploring Old Computer Games |url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=NasqDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=%22Keen+dreams%22+%22graphics%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DlYIHsYXT_&amp;sig=gCkdPOmvvGz0-VVK9zU6tC3QAEE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwirl5qIpd7XAhUSyKQKHUEGC344HhDoAQgxMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Keen%20dreams%22%20%22graphics%22&amp;f=false |language=English |publisher=Springer |publication-date=May 9, 2016 |page=45 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-30004-7 |isbn=978-3-319-30004-7 |access-date=November 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Adaptive tile refresh using hardware scrolling made its first appearance in an unreleased test game dubbed ''Dangerous Dave in Copyright Infringement''. The title of "[[Dangerous Dave]]" had been previously used by [[John Romero]] while programming games for [[Softdisk]]. The new game is a recreation of the first level of [[Nintendo]]'s ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', intended as a realistic test bed for the adaptive tile refresh concept, and was developed within a week. The team of future id Software employees, still working for Softdisk, then recreated the entire ''[[Mario]]'' game, hoping that Nintendo would license the game for the PC. Nintendo declined the offer to release the game after id Software finished it.&lt;ref name="SMB3 demo at IFD"&gt;{{cite av media | title=Super Mario Bros. 3 Demo (1990) | date=1990 | publisher=John Romero | url=https://vimeo.com/148909578 | accessdate=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SMB3 demo at Ars"&gt;{{cite web | title=Here’s what id Software’s PC port of Mario 3 could have looked like | date=December 14, 2015 | first=Kyle | last=Orland | publisher=Ars Technica | url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/12/heres-what-id-softwares-pc-port-of-mario-3-could-have-looked-like/ | accessdate=December 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Masters of Doom"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Masters of Doom: how two guys created an empire and transformed pop culture | first = David | last = Kushner | publisher = Random House, Inc | location=New York, NY | year = 2004 | origyear=2003 | oclc=50129329 | isbn=9780375505249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first market appearance of Carmack's adaptive tile refresh came in id Software's first installment of the ''Commander Keen'' game series, ''Marooned on Mars''.

==Technical details==
{{original research|section|date=January 2018}}

EGA has several features that enable the adaptive tile refresh effect:

# The [[Framebuffer|screen buffer]] can be slightly wider than the screen and arbitrarily high, subject to [[video memory]] limitations.
# The position within this buffer from which the screen is drawn can be offset by 1 pixel increments, either horizontally or vertically.
# It has enough video memory to store two such screen buffers, and still have room left over for [[Tile engine|tiles]] and [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]].

Carmack used these capabilities to create a buffer that is 64 pixels wider and taller than the screen, leaving room for one extra row and column of tiles in the buffer off the edge of the screen. He used the offset capabilities of the card to let the screen slide through the buffer for smooth scrolling, which partially reveals the extra tiles.

Scrolling is limited to the buffer size, and scrolling further wraps around to show data from the other side of the buffer. So in order to scroll through an entire level, when the scrolling amounts to a whole tile's worth, Carmack's code then draws the next row of tiles from the level into the buffer, just off the edge of the screen, ready to be displayed when the scrolling continues in that direction.

But since only the edges of the screen are being redrawn at any time, sprites in the level do not get redrawn until they reach the edge of the screen. To counteract this, the code calculates which tiles a moving sprite had previously covered and redraws them to erase the old sprite image, then draws the new sprite image in its new position. This allows sprites to be animated independently of the scrolling with minimal computational effort.

Since moving a sprite in this way involves first erasing it and then redrawing it, the image of the erased sprite may be visible briefly, causing flicker. The final part of Carmack's technique is the use of the same EGA hardware features used for scrolling to also implement [[Multiple buffering#Double buffering in computer graphics|double buffering]]: setting up a second buffer into which the code can draw while the first buffer is being shown on screen, which is then switched out during screen refresh. This ensures that no frame is ever displayed mid-drawing, which yields smooth, flicker-free animation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2536">'''Adoxography''' is elegant or refined writing that addresses a trivial or base subject. The term was coined in the late 19th century. It was a form of rhetorical exercise "in which the legitimate methods of the encomium are applied to persons or objects in themselves obviously unworthy of praise, as being trivial, ugly, useless, ridiculous, dangerous or vicious" — see Arthur S. Pease, "Things Without Honor", ''Classical Philology'', Vol. XXI (1926) 27, at 28–9. Pease surveys this field from its origins with the defence of Helen ascribed to Gorgias, and cites De Quincey's "[[On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts]]" and Lewis Carroll’s ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' as modern examples. Pease suggests that the skill was taught in ancient Greece, where the matters known to have been praised included gout, blindness, deafness, old age, negligence, adultery, flies, gnats, bedbugs, smoke, and dung. 

The art was rediscovered during the revival of [[rhetoric]] in the 16th century. Among the best known and most influential examples was [[Erasmus]]' ''Moriae Encomium'' or ''[[The Praise of Folly]]''.  

==Literary Examples==
The first English treatise on the subject was Anthony Munday's ''"The defence of contraries"'' (1593), a translation of Charles Estienne's "Paradoxes, ce sont propos contre la commune opinion" and based on Ortensio Landi's "Paradossi". It contained essays that praised, amongst other things, poverty, drunkenness and stupidity.  [[Walter K. Olson]], writing in the Leisure &amp; Arts section of the September 8, 2005, edition of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', quotes the following passage from Sadakat Kadri, "The Trial: A History, from Socrates to O.J. Simpson": "Elizabethan schoolboys...were commonly taught adoxography, the art of eruditely praising worthless things." The passage comes in the course of an account of Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]'s trial, and Kadri observes that Munday thought [[lawyers]] could particularly learn from his book. This was a period of English history when the jury trial was assuming its modern form, and Kadri later shows that the ability to praise apparently worthless causes has been central to courtroom [[advocacy]] for centuries. Celebrated adoxographers could therefore be said to include men such as [[Cicero]] and [[Clarence Darrow]].

In modern writing, the term "adoxography" is also used as an often humorous self-reference in writing, often in regard to humor columns or blogs.

'''Ahmad bin Muhammad bin al-Siddiq al-Ghumari''' was a Muslim traditionist and scholar of [[Hadith]] from Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;Mustafa Shah, ''The Hạdīth: Scholarship, perspectives, and criticism'', Routledge, 2010, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ghumari was born on the 27th of [[Ramadan]] in 1320 according to the [[Islamic calendar]], corresponding to December 26, 1902 [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]].&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; He was the older brother of fellow clerics [[Abdullah al-Ghumari]] and [[Abd al-Aziz al-Ghumari]]. As a child, he studied in Morocco's traditional [[madrasa]] system, [[Hafiz (Qur'an)|memorizing]] the entire [[Qur'an]] by heart, in addition to traditional Islamic texts such as [[Alfiya]], [[Ajārūmīya]] and [[Bulugh al-Maram]].

In 1921, he traveled to [[Egypt]] and enrolled in [[Al-Azhar University]], returning to Morocco upon the death of his father.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}} Ghumari went to Egypt a second time in 1931 when his younger brothers Abdullah and Muhammad also enrolled in the university. Due to fears regarding activity of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] in Egypt, his brother Abdullah was sentenced to ten years in prison on accusations of ties to the group in 1961. Ahmad al-Ghumari, upon hearing the news of his younger brother's long sentence, fell ill and died eight months later.{{Citation needed|date= May 2018}}

==Career==
Ghumari was a prolific writer, having authored more than one-hundred books. He was well known for a debate which acrimoniously began between him and fellow hadith scholar [[Muhammad Nasiruddin al-Albani]], and later continued with between Ghumari's younger brother Abdullah and Albani.&lt;ref name=moin&gt;Muhammad Moin, [http://alsonnah.wordpress.com/2011/03/08/ahmed-al-ghumari-on-al-albani/ "Ahmed Al-Ghumari on Al-Albani"]. ''Al-Sunnah'': 8 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the older Ghumari's attestation to Albani's high level of knowledge and respected status in [[Hadith studies]], the nature of the debate between them became personal and involved character attacks.

Like the rest of his family, Ghumari was a leader of the [[Siddiqiyya]] Sufi [[Tariqa|order]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Abd al-Aziz al-Ghumari]], ''Ma Yajuz wa ma la Yajuz fi al-Hayat al-Zawjiyyah'', pg. 9. Amman: Dar al-Fath, 2009. {{ISBN|9789957231309}}&lt;/ref&gt; a branch of the larger [[Shadhili]] order.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} [[Muhammad Taqi-ud-Din al-Hilali]] claimed that al-Ghumari had chosen to live a very simple life and eschewed material excess.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hassan Kettani]], ''Fiqh al-Hafizh Ahmad bin al-Siddiq al-Ghumari'', pg. 58. [[Amman]]: Dar al-Bayariq, 2001. Jordanian National Library #2001/6/1146&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views==
Although a practitioner of [[Sufism]], Ghumari was a strong critic of many Sufis, especially the rival [[Naqshbandi]] [[Tariqa|order]].&lt;ref name=haddad&gt;[[Gibril Haddad]], [http://www.abc.se/home/m9783/ir/f/The%20Ghumari%20School.htm The Ghumari School]. 6 December 2002: Living Islam. Last updated 2 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Like [[Ibn Hazm]], Ghumari viewed scholarly [[Ikhtilaf|difference of opinion]] as a curse. Like his brothers, he often used harsh language when responding to intellectual opponents.&lt;ref name=moin/&gt;&lt;ref name=haddad/&gt; Having originally followed the [[Maliki]] [[Madhhab|school of thought]] like most of Muslim scholarship in Morocco, al-Ghumari later switched to the [[Shafi'i]] school for a period and finally opted for absolute [[Ijtihad|independent reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Hassan Kettani, ''Fiqh al-Hafizh'', pgs. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most of Moroccan scholarship, al-Ghumari opposed the [[Ash'ari]] school of theology.&lt;ref name =kett62&gt;Hassan Kettani, ''Fiqh al-Hafizh'', pg. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muhammad Abu Khubza]], among other Moroccan scholars, also claim that al-Ghumari temporarily adhered to the [[Zaidiyyah]] school of [[Shia Islam]].&lt;ref name =kett62/&gt;

In [[Australia]], the '''Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute''' (Australian AI Institute, AAII, or A&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) was a government-funded research and development laboratory for investigating and commercializing [[Artificial Intelligence]], specifically [[Intelligent agent|Intelligent Software Agents]].

== History ==
The AAII was started in 1988 as an initiative by the [[Bob Hawke|Hawke government]] and closed in 1999. It was backed by support from the Computer Power Group, [[SRI International]] and the [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|Victorian State Government]]. The director of the group was [[Michael Georgeff]] who came from SRI, contributing his experience with the [[Procedural Reasoning System|PRS]] and vision in the domain of [[Intelligent agents]]. It was located in the Melbourne suburb of Carlton before moving to more spacious premises in the city centre of [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. At its peak it had more than 40 staff and took up two floors of an office building on the corner of Latrobe and Russell Streets.

In the late 1990s, the AAII spun out Agentis International (Agentis Business Solutions) to address the commercialization of the developed technology. Another company, Agent Oriented Software (AOS) was formed by a number of ex-AAII staff to pursue agent technology developing [[JACK Intelligent Agents]]. After the AAII shutdown, those staff that remained and the intellectual property were transferred to Agentis International.

== Projects ==
This section summarizes a selection of the software and commercial projects that came out of the AAII: 

* [[Procedural Reasoning System]] (PRS) ongoing development and application of PRS in collaboration with [[SRI International]]
* [[Distributed Multi-Agent Reasoning System]] (dMARS) an agent-oriented development and implementation environment for building complex, distributed, time-critical systems. Developed as a [[C++]] extension to PRS.
* Smart Whole AiR Mission Model (SWARMM) an agent-oriented simulation system developed by AAII in conjunction with and for the Air Operations Division (AOD) of the [[Defence Science and Technology Organisation|DSTO]].
* Optimal Aircraft Sequencing using Intelligent Scheduling (OASIS) an air traffic management system written in the PRS that accurately estimated aircraft arrival time, determined an optima sequence for landings and alerted operators as to the actions required to achieve the sequence.  It was designed to reduce air traffic congestion and maximize the use of runways.&lt;ref name="iac"&gt;{{cite book |title=Intelligent Adaptive Control: Industrial Applications |last=Kuwata |first=Y. |chapter=Intelligent Techniques in Air Traffic Management |editor1-first=Lakhmi C. |editor1-last=Jain |editor2-first=Clarence W. |editor2-last=de Silva |author2=Sugimoto |year=1998 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=0849398053 |page=393 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nbMjiXF6PRMC |accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A prototype was developed for [[Sydney Airport]] using dMARS called HORIZON.
* Single Point of Contact (SPOC) was a system developed for [[Optus]] to assist customer service representatives to meet the objective to meet 98% of customer enquirers with a single point of contact with the company. The system was built using dMARS and involved a multilayer architecture.

== Technical Notes ==
Over the course of its existence, the AAII released more than 75 of public technical notes [https://web.archive.org/web/19990428115401/http://www.aaii.oz.au/research/techreports/tnlist.html]. This section lists an available selection of these notes.

In the early 20th century, Russell led the British "revolt against [[British idealism|idealism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Russell and G.&amp;nbsp;E. Moore broke themselves free from British [[Idealism]] which, for nearly 90 years, had dominated British philosophy. Russell would later recall in "My Mental Development" that "with a sense of escaping from prison, we allowed ourselves to think that grass is green, that the sun and stars would exist if no one was aware of them ..."—Russell B, (1944) "My Mental Development", in Schilpp, Paul Arthur: ''The Philosophy of Bertrand Russell'', New York: Tudor, 1951, pp. 3–20.&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered one of the founders of [[analytic philosophy]] along with his predecessor [[Gottlob Frege]], colleague [[G.&amp;nbsp;E.

==Biography==

===Early life and background===
[[File:Bertrand Russell in 1876.jpg|thumb|upright|Russell as a four-year-old]]
[[File:Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park.jpg|thumb|Childhood home, [[Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park|Pembroke Lodge]]]]

Bertrand Russell was born on 18 May 1872 at Ravenscroft, [[Trellech]], [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], into an influential and liberal family of the [[British aristocracy]].&lt;ref&gt;Sidney Hook, "Lord Russell and the War Crimes Trial", ''Bertrand Russell: critical assessments'', Vol. 1, edited by A. D. Irvine, New York 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;178&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, [[John Russell, Viscount Amberley|Viscount]] and [[Katharine Russell, Viscountess Amberley|Viscountess Amberley]], were radical for their times. Lord Amberley consented to his wife's affair with their children's tutor, the biologist [[Douglas Spalding]]. Both were early advocates of [[birth control]] at a time when this was considered scandalous.&lt;ref name="calicut"&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul|first=Ashley|title=Bertrand Russell: The Man and His Ideas.|url=http://www.geocities.com/vu3ash/index.html|accessdate=28 October 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060501064331/http://www.geocities.com/vu3ash/index.html|archivedate=1 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Amberley was an [[atheist]] and his atheism was evident when he asked the philosopher [[John Stuart Mill]] to act as Russell's secular godfather.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand and Perkins, Ray (ed.) ''Yours faithfully, Bertrand Russell''. Open Court Publishing, 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt; Mill died the year after Russell's birth, but his writings had a great effect on Russell's life.

His paternal grandfather, the [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Earl Russell]], had been asked twice by [[Queen Victoria]] to form a government, serving her as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] in the 1840s and 1860s.&lt;ref name="John R"&gt;{{cite web| last = Bloy| first = Marjie, PhD| title = Lord John Russell (1792–1878)| url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/pms/russell.html| accessdate =28 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russells had been prominent in England for several centuries before this, coming to power and the [[peerage]] with the rise of the [[Tudor dynasty]] (see: [[Duke of Bedford]]). They established themselves as one of the leading British [[British Whig Party|Whig]] families, and participated in every great political event from the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] in 1536–1540 to the [[Glorious Revolution]] in 1688–1689 and the [[Great Reform Act]] in 1832.&lt;ref name="John R"/&gt;&lt;ref name="peerage"&gt;Cokayne, G.

Reprint in 6 volumes, Gloucester, UK: Alan Sutton Publishing, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Amberley was the daughter of [[Edward Stanley, 2nd Baron Stanley of Alderley|Lord]] and [[Henrietta Stanley, Baroness Stanley of Alderley|Lady Stanley of Alderley]].&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt; Russell often feared the ridicule of his maternal grandmother,&lt;ref name=Booth&gt;{{cite book|first=Wayne C.|last=Booth|title=Modern Dogma and the Rhetoric of Assent|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1974|isbn=0226065723}}&lt;!--|accessdate=6 December 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; one of the campaigners for [[education of women]].&lt;ref&gt;The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide, 1866–1928 By Elizabeth Crawford&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood and adolescence===
Russell had two siblings: brother [[Frank Russell, 2nd Earl Russell|Frank]] (nearly seven years older than Bertrand), and sister Rachel (four years older). In June 1874 Russell's mother died of [[diphtheria]], followed shortly by Rachel's death. In January 1876, his father died of [[bronchitis]] following a long period of [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. Frank and Bertrand were placed in the care of their staunchly [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] paternal grandparents, who lived at [[Pembroke Lodge, Richmond Park|Pembroke Lodge]] in [[Richmond Park]]. His grandfather, former Prime Minister [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Earl Russell]], died in 1878, and was remembered by Russell as a kindly old man in a wheelchair. His grandmother, the [[Frances Russell, Countess Russell|Countess Russell]] (née Lady Frances Elliot), was the dominant family figure for the rest of Russell's childhood and youth.&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="calicut"/&gt;

The countess was from a Scottish [[Presbyterian]] family, and successfully petitioned the [[Court of Chancery]] to set aside a provision in Amberley's will requiring the children to be raised as agnostics. Despite her religious conservatism, she held progressive views in other areas (accepting [[Darwinism]] and supporting [[Home Rule|Irish Home Rule]]), and her influence on Bertrand Russell's outlook on [[social justice]] and standing up for principle remained with him throughout his life. (One could challenge the view that Bertrand stood up for his principles, based on his own well-known quotation: "I would never die for my beliefs because I might be wrong".) Her favourite Bible verse, "Thou shalt not follow a multitude to do evil" ([[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 23:2), became his motto. The atmosphere at Pembroke Lodge was one of frequent prayer, emotional repression, and formality; Frank reacted to this with open rebellion, but the young Bertrand learned to hide his feelings.

Russell's adolescence was very lonely, and he often contemplated suicide. He remarked in his autobiography that his keenest interests were in religion and mathematics, and that only his wish to know more mathematics kept him from suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|page=38|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at home by a series of tutors.&lt;ref name="nobel prize"&gt;The Nobel Foundation (1950). [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1950/russell-bio.html Bertrand Russell: The Nobel Prize in Literature 1950]. Retrieved 11 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; When Russell was eleven years old, his brother Frank introduced him to the work of [[Euclid]], which transformed his life.&lt;ref name="calicut"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Greeks"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lenz, John R.|title=Bertrand Russell and the Greeks|url=http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1443&amp;context=russelljournal|format=PDF|accessdate=27 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During these formative years he also discovered the works of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]. In his autobiography, he writes: "I spent all my spare time reading him, and learning him by heart, knowing no one to whom I could speak of what I thought or felt, I used to reflect how wonderful it would have been to know Shelley, and to wonder whether I should meet any live human being with whom I should feel so much sympathy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|page=35|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell claimed that beginning at age 15, he spent considerable time thinking about the validity of [[Dogma#In religion|Christian religious dogma]], which he found very unconvincing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP4FDLegX9s|title=1959 Bertrand Russell CBC interview|year=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this age, he came to the conclusion that there is no [[free will]] and, two years later, that there is no life after death. Finally, at the age of 18, after reading Mill's ''Autobiography'', he abandoned the "[[First Cause]]" argument and became an [[atheist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|chapter=2: Adolescence|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/4833 |title=Bertrand Russell on God |year=1959 |publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=8 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126090302/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/4833 |archivedate=26 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He traveled to the continent in 1890 with an American friend, [[Edward FitzGerald (mountaineer)|Edward FitzGerald]], and with FitzGerald's family he visited the [[Paris Exhibition of 1889]] and was able to climb the [[Eiffel Tower]] soon after it was completed.&lt;ref name=Russell1967a&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: 1872–1914 |year=1967 |edition=2000 |url={{Google books|dVBpAwAAQBAJ|page=39|plainurl=y}} |page=39 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University and first marriage===
[[File:Portrait of Bertrand Russell in 1893.jpg|thumb|Russell at Trinity College in 1893]]
Russell won a scholarship to read for the [[Mathematical Tripos]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], and commenced his studies there in 1890,&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=RSL890BA|name=Russell, the Hon. Bertrand Arthur William}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking as coach [[Robert Rumsey Webb]]. He became acquainted with the younger [[George Edward Moore]] and came under the influence of [[Alfred North Whitehead]], who recommended him to the [[Cambridge Apostles]]. He quickly distinguished himself in mathematics and philosophy, graduating as seventh [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]] in the former in 1893 and becoming a Fellow in the latter in 1895.&lt;ref name="Whitehead"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Whitehead.html|title=Alfred North Whitehead|accessdate=8 November 2007|last=O'Connor|first=J.

Russell was 17&amp;nbsp;years old in the summer of 1889 when he met the family of [[Alys Pearsall Smith]], an American [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]] five years older, who was a graduate of [[Bryn Mawr College]] near [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name=Russell1967b&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: 1872–1914 |year=1967 |edition=2000 |url={{Google books|dVBpAwAAQBAJ|page=72|plainurl=y}} |page=72 |location=New York |publisher=Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Monk1996&gt;{{cite book |last=Monk |first=Ray |title=Bertrand Russell: The Spirit of Solitude, 1872–1921 |url={{Google books|AzssomBIDRIC|page=37|plainurl=y}} |year=1996 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-684-82802-2 |page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He became a friend of the Pearsall Smith family &amp;ndash; they knew him primarily as "Lord John's grandson" and enjoyed showing him off.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

He soon fell in love with the puritanical, high-minded Alys, and, contrary to his grandmother's wishes, married her on 13&amp;nbsp;December 1894. Their marriage began to fall apart in 1901 when it occurred to Russell, while he was cycling, that he no longer loved her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=I went out bicycling one afternoon, and suddenly, as I was riding along a country road, I realised that I no longer loved Alys|title=Autobiography|page=150|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; She asked him if he loved her and he replied that he did not. Russell also disliked Alys's mother, finding her controlling and cruel. It was to be a hollow shell of a marriage. A lengthy period of separation began in 1911 with Russell's affair with [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]],&lt;ref name="the Journal of the Bertrand Russell Archives"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digitalcommons.mcmaster.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1353&amp;context=russelljournal&amp;sei-redir=1|title=Bertrand Russell Meets His Muse: The Impact of Lady Ottoline Morrell (1911–12)|accessdate=1 March 2012|last=Moran|first=Margaret|year=1991|publisher=McMaster University Library Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he and Alys finally divorced in 1921 to enable Russell to remarry.&lt;ref name="Russell2002"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Griffin |editor-first=Nicholas |last=Russell |first=Bertrand

During his years of separation from Alys, Russell had passionate (and often simultaneous) affairs with a number of women, including Morrell and the actress [[Lady Constance Malleson]].&lt;ref name="private"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newcriterion.com:81/archive/11/sept92/brussell.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205032455/http://newcriterion.com/archive/11/sept92/brussell.htm |archivedate=5 December 2006 |title=Love, logic &amp; unbearable pity: The private Bertrand Russell |accessdate=15 November 2007 |last=Kimball |first=Roger |work=The New Criterion |volume=11 |issue=1 |date=September 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have suggested that at this point he had an affair with [[Vivienne Haigh-Wood]], the English governess and writer, and first wife of [[T.

===Early career===
[[File:Russell1907-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Russell in 1907]]
Russell began his published work in 1896 with ''German Social Democracy'', a study in politics that was an early indication of a lifelong interest in political and social theory. In 1896 he taught German social democracy at the [[London School of Economics]].&lt;ref name="LSE"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lse.ac.uk/aboutLSE/keyFacts/nobelPrizeWinners/russell.aspx|title=London School of Economics|website=Lse.ac.uk|date=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Coefficients (dining club)|Coefficients dining club]] of social reformers set up in 1902 by the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] campaigners [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]].&lt;ref name="LettersPg16"&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|editor=Ray Perkins|title=Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell: Letters to the Editor 1904–1969|year=2001|publisher=Open Court Publishing|location=Chicago|isbn=0-8126-9449-X|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EayyTTpXL-QC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16|accessdate=16 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He now started an intensive study of the [[foundations of mathematics]] at Trinity.
In 1898 he wrote ''An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry'' which discussed the [[Cayley–Klein metric]]s used for [[non-Euclidean geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand (1898) ''An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry'', p.&amp;nbsp;32, re-issued 1956 by [[Dover Books]]&lt;/ref&gt;
He attended the [[International Congress of Philosophy]] in Paris in 1900 where he met [[Giuseppe Peano]] and [[Alessandro Padoa]].  The Italians had responded to [[Georg Cantor]], making a science of [[set theory]]; they gave Russell their literature including the [[Formulario mathematico]]. Russell was impressed by the precision of Peano's arguments at the Congress, read the literature upon returning to England, and came upon [[Russell's paradox]]. In 1903 he published ''[[The Principles of Mathematics]]'', a work on foundations of mathematics. It advanced a thesis of [[logicism]], that mathematics and logic are one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1950/russell-bio.html|title=Bertrand Russell, biography|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 29, in February 1901, Russell underwent what he called a "sort of mystic illumination", after witnessing [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]]'s wife's acute suffering in an [[Angina pectoris|angina]] attack. "I found myself filled with semi-mystical feelings about beauty ... and with a desire almost as profound as that of the [[Buddha]] to find some philosophy which should make human life endurable", Russell would later recall. "At the end of those five minutes, I had become a completely different person."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|chapter=6: Principia Mathematica|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905 he wrote the essay "[[On Denoting]]", which was published in the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''. Russell was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1908|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1908]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt; The three-volume ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', written with Whitehead, was published between 1910 and 1913. This, along with the earlier ''The Principles of Mathematics'', soon made Russell world-famous in his field.

In 1910 he became a [[University of Cambridge]] lecturer at Trinity College where he studied. He was considered for a Fellowship, which would give him a vote in the college government and protect him from being fired for his opinions, but was passed over because he was "anti-clerical", essentially because he was agnostic. He was approached by the Austrian engineering student [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], who became his PhD student. Russell viewed Wittgenstein as a genius and a successor who would continue his work on logic. He spent hours dealing with Wittgenstein's various [[phobia]]s and his frequent bouts of despair. This was often a drain on Russell's energy, but Russell continued to be fascinated by him and encouraged his academic development, including the publication of Wittgenstein's ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' in 1922.&lt;ref name="Wittgenstein"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbjones.com/rbjpub/philos/history/rvw001.htm|title=Russell on Wittgenstein|publisher=Rbjones.com|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell delivered his lectures on [[Logical Atomism]], his version of these ideas, in 1918, before the end of [[World War I]]. Wittgenstein was, at that time, serving in the Austrian Army and subsequently spent nine months in an Italian [[prisoner of war]] camp at the end of the conflict.

===First World War===
During World War I, Russell was one of the few people to engage in active [[opposition to World War I|pacifist activities]] and in 1916, because of his lack of a Fellowship, he was dismissed from Trinity College following his conviction under the [[Defence of the Realm Act 1914]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last = Hochschild|first = Adam|year = 2011|title = I Tried to Stop the Bloody Thing|periodical = The American Scholar|url = http://www.theamericanscholar.org/i-tried-to-stop-the-bloody-thing/|accessdate =10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later described this as an illegitimate means the state used to violate freedom of expression, in [[Free Thought and Official Propaganda]]. Russell played a significant part in the ''Leeds Convention'' in June 1917, a historic event which saw well over a thousand "anti-war socialists" gather; many being delegates from the [[Independent Labour Party]] and the Socialist Party, united in their pacifist beliefs and advocating a peace settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scharfenburger|first=Paul|title=1917|url=http://musicandhistory.com/music-and-history-by-the-year/178-1917.html|publisher=MusicandHistory.com|date=17 October 2012|accessdate=7 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117062625/http://musicandhistory.com/music-and-history-by-the-year/178-1917.html|archivedate=17 January 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international press reported that Russell appeared with a number of Labour [[Member of Parliament|MPs]], including [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and [[Philip Snowden]], as well as former [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] MP and anti-conscription campaigner, Professor [[Arnold Lupton]].  After the event, Russell told [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]] that, "to my surprise, when I got up to speak, I was given the greatest ovation that was possible to give anybody".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=Pacifism and Revolution |page=xxxiv |chapter=A Summer of Hope |year=1995 |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=British Socialists – Peace Terms Discussed|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article15731745|date=5 June 1917|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trinity incident resulted in Russell being fined £100, which he refused to pay in hope that he would be sent to prison, but his books were sold at auction to raise the money. The books were bought by friends; he later treasured his copy of the [[King James Version|King James Bible]] that was stamped "Confiscated by Cambridge Police".

A later conviction for publicly lecturing against inviting the US to enter the war on the United Kingdom's side resulted in six months' imprisonment in [[Brixton (HM Prison)|Brixton prison]] (see ''[[Bertrand Russell's views on society]]'') in 1918.&lt;ref name="Pacifist"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bertrand Russell and the Pacifists in the First World War|last=Vellacott|first=Jo|isbn=0-85527-454-9|publisher=Harvester Press|location=Brighton|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later said of his imprisonment:

{{quote|I found prison in many ways quite agreeable. I had no engagements, no difficult decisions to make, no fear of callers, no interruptions to my work. I read enormously; I wrote a book, "Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy"... and began the work for "Analysis of Mind"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|chapter=8: The First War|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Russell was reinstated to Trinity in 1919, resigned in 1920, was Tarner Lecturer 1926 and became a Fellow again in 1944 until 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Trinity College|url=https://www.trin.cam.ac.uk/about/historical-overview/trinity-in-literature/|title=Trinity in Literature|accessdate=3 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Bertrand again gained press attention when attending a "banquet" in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] with well-known campaigners, including [[Arnold Lupton]], who had been a [[Members of Parliament|Member of Parliament]] and had also endured imprisonment for "passive resistance to military or naval service".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=M.

===G. H. Hardy on the Trinity controversy and Russell's personal life===
In 1941, [[G. H. Hardy]] wrote a 61-page pamphlet titled ''Bertrand Russell and Trinity'' &amp;ndash; published later as a book by Cambridge University Press with a foreword by [[C. D. Broad]] &amp;ndash; in which he gave an authoritative account about Russell's 1916 dismissal from Trinity College, explaining that a reconciliation between the college and Russell had later taken place and gave details about Russell's personal life. Hardy writes that Russell's dismissal had created a scandal since the vast majority of the Fellows of the College opposed the decision. The ensuing pressure from the Fellows induced the Council to reinstate Russell. In January 1920, it was announced that Russell had accepted the reinstatement offer from Trinity and would begin lecturing from October. In July 1920, Russell applied for a one year leave of absence; this was approved. He spent the year giving lectures in China and Japan. In January 1921, it was announced by Trinity that Russell had resigned and his resignation had been accepted. This resignation, Hardy explains, was completely voluntary and was not the result of another altercation.

The reason for the resignation, according to Hardy, was that Russell was going through a tumultuous time in his personal life with a divorce and subsequent remarriage. Russell contemplated asking Trinity for another one-year leave of absence but decided against it, since this would have been an "unusual application" and the situation had the potential to snowball into another controversy. Although Russell did the right thing, in Hardy's opinion, the reputation of the College suffered due to Russell's resignation since the ‘world of learning’ knew about Russell's altercation with Trinity but not that the rift had healed. In 1925, Russell was asked by the Council of Trinity College to give the ''Tarner Lectures'' on the Philosophy of the Sciences; these would later be the basis for one of Russell's best received books according to Hardy: ''The Analysis of Matter'', published in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bertrand Russell and Trinity|author=G. H. Hardy|pages=57–8|year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the preface to the Trinity pamphlet, Hardy wrote:

{{quote|I wish to make it plain that Russell himself is not responsible, directly or indirectly, for the writing of the pamphlet ... I wrote it without his knowledge and, when I sent him the typescript and asked for his permission to print it, I suggested that, unless it contained misstatement of fact, he should make no comment on it. He agreed to this ... no word has been changed as the result of any suggestion from him.}}

===Between the wars===
In August 1920, Russell travelled to [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] as part of an official delegation sent by the British government to investigate the effects of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]].&lt;ref name="FreeLib"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bertrand Russell (1872–1970)|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|url=http://russell.thefreelibrary.com/|accessdate=11 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote a four-part series of articles, titled "Soviet Russia{{emdash}}1920", for the US magazine ''[[The Nation]]''.&lt;ref name="nation1"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=http://www.unz.org/Pub/Nation-1920jul31-00121 |title=Soviet Russia{{emdash}}1920 |magazine=The Nation |date=31 July 1920 |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |pages=121–125 |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sov1920"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thenation.com/article/lenin-trotzky-and-gorky/ |title=Lenin, Trotzky and Gorky |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |work=The Nation |date=20 February 2008 |orig-year=First published 1920 |accessdate=20 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He met [[Vladimir Lenin]] and had an hour-long conversation with him. In his autobiography, he mentions that he found Lenin disappointing, sensing an "impish cruelty" in him and comparing him to "an opinionated professor". He cruised down the [[Volga]] on a steamship. His experiences destroyed his previous tentative support for the revolution. He wrote a book ''The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism''&lt;ref name="Practice &amp;"&gt;Russell, Bertrand [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17350 The Practice and Theory of Bolshevism by Bertrand Russell], 1920&lt;/ref&gt; about his experiences on this trip, taken with a group of 24 others from the UK, all of whom came home thinking well of the régime, despite Russell's attempts to change their minds. For example, he told them that he heard shots fired in the middle of the night and was sure these were clandestine executions, but the others maintained that it was only cars backfiring.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

[[File:Russell with John and Kate.jpg|thumb|left|Russell with his children, [[John Conrad Russell, 4th Earl Russell|John]] and [[Lady Katharine Tait|Kate]]]]
Russell's lover [[Dora Russell|Dora Black]], a British author, [[feminist]] and socialist campaigner, visited Russia independently at the same time; in contrast to his reaction, she was enthusiastic about the revolution.&lt;ref name="Practice &amp;" /&gt;

The following autumn Russell, accompanied by Dora, visited [[Beijing|Peking]] (as it was then known in the West) to lecture on philosophy for a year.&lt;ref name="nobel prize"/&gt; He went with optimism and hope, seeing China as [[History of the Republic of China#Fight against warlordism and the First United Front|then being]] on a new path.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Bertrand|title=The Problem of China|date=1972|publisher=George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd.|location=London|page=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars present in China at the time included [[John Dewey]]&lt;ref name="pneumonia"/&gt; and [[Rabindranath Tagore]], the Indian Nobel-laureate poet.&lt;ref name="nobel prize"/&gt; Before leaving China, Russell became gravely ill with [[pneumonia]], and [[List of premature obituaries|incorrect reports]] of his death were published in the Japanese press.&lt;ref name="pneumonia"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bertrand Russell Reported Dead|work=The New York Times|date=21 April 1921|accessdate=11 December 2007|format=PDF|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1921/04/21/107014047.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the couple visited Japan on their return journey, Dora took on the role of spurning the local press by handing out notices reading "Mr. Bertrand Russell, having died according to the Japanese press, is unable to give interviews to Japanese journalists".&lt;ref name="papers"&gt;{{cite book|title=Uncertain Paths to Freedom: Russia and China, 1919–22|work=The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell|volume=15|publisher=Routledge|year=2000|isbn=0-415-09411-9|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|editor=Richard A.

We don't use irony (fundamentally, because it interferes with consistently clearly stating the verifiable facts). It is also unlikely that even BR's use of it in this circumstance, even if verifiable as his words, rises above chit-chat and to the level of being worthy of mention as a *notable* utterance or opinion of his.}}

Dora was six months pregnant when the couple returned to England on 26 August 1921. Russell arranged a hasty divorce from Alys, marrying Dora six days after the divorce was finalised, on 27 September 1921. Russell's children with Dora were [[John Conrad Russell, 4th Earl Russell]], born on 16 November 1921, and [[Lady Katharine Tait|Katharine Jane Russell]] (now Lady Katharine Tait), born on 29 December 1923. Russell supported his family during this time by writing popular books explaining matters of [[physics]], ethics, and education to the layman.

From 1922 to 1927 the Russells divided their time between London and [[Cornwall]], spending summers in [[Porthcurno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|page=386|isbn=9780415189859|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1922|1922]] and [[United Kingdom general election, 1923|1923 general elections]] Russell stood as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] candidate in the [[Chelsea (UK Parliament constituency)|Chelsea constituency]], but only on the basis that he knew he was extremely unlikely to be elected in such a safe Conservative seat, and he was not on either occasion.

Together with Dora, Russell founded the experimental Beacon Hill School in 1927. The school was run from a succession of different locations, including its original premises at the Russells' residence, Telegraph House, near [[Harting]], West Sussex. On 8 July 1930 Dora gave birth to her third child Harriet Ruth. After he left the school in 1932, Dora continued it until 1943.&lt;ref name="Beacon"&gt;Inside Beacon Hill: Bertrand Russell as Schoolmaster.

On a tour through the US in 1927 Russell met Barry Fox (later [[Barry Stevens (therapist)|Barry Stevens]]) who became a well-known [[Gestalt therapy|Gestalt therapist]] and writer in later years.&lt;ref&gt;Kranz, D. (2011): [http://www.gestalt.de/kranz_stevens_leben.html Barry Stevens: Leben Gestalten]. In: Gestaltkritik, 2/2011, p.&amp;nbsp;4-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell and Fox developed an intensive relationship. In Fox's words: "... for three years we were very close."&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, B. (1970): Don't Push the River. Lafayette, Cal. (Real People Press), p.&amp;nbsp;26.&lt;/ref&gt; Fox sent her daughter Judith to Beacon Hill School for some time.&lt;ref&gt;Gorham, D.

(1981): Recent Acquisitions: Correspondence, in: Russell: the Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies, Vol 1, Iss. 1, Article 6,  43 – 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the death of his elder brother Frank, in 1931, Russell became the 3rd Earl Russell.

Russell's marriage to Dora grew increasingly tenuous, and it reached a breaking point over her having two children with an American journalist, Griffin Barry.&lt;ref name="Dora"/&gt; They separated in 1932 and finally divorced. On 18 January 1936, Russell married his third wife, an [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] undergraduate named [[Patricia Russell (nee Spence)|Patricia ("Peter") Spence]], who had been his children's governess since 1930. Russell and Peter had one son, [[Conrad Russell, 5th Earl Russell|Conrad Sebastian Robert Russell]], 5th Earl Russell, who became a prominent historian and one of the leading figures in the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] party.&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt;

Russell returned to the [[London School of Economics]] to lecture on the science of power in 1937.&lt;ref name="LSE" /&gt;

During the 1930s, Russell became a close friend and collaborator of [[V. K. Krishna Menon]], then secretary of the India League, the foremost lobby in the United Kingdom for Indian self-rule.{{vague|date=July 2014|reason= was Menon *at that point* AIML sec'y, or was it BR who *later* became sec'y?}}

===Second World War===
Russell opposed rearmament against [[Nazi Germany]]. In 1937 he wrote in a personal letter: "If the Germans succeed in sending an invading army to England we should do best to treat them as visitors, give them quarters and invite the commander and chief to dine with the prime minister."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/02/19/museum-of-tolerance-acquires-bertrand-russells-nazi-appeasement-letter/ |title=Museum Of Tolerance Acquires Bertrand Russell’s Nazi Appeasement Letter |website=Losangeles.cbslocal.com |date=2014-02-19 |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940, he changed his view that avoiding a full-scale world war was more important than defeating Hitler. He concluded that Adolf Hitler taking over all of Europe would be a permanent threat to democracy. In 1943, he adopted a stance toward large-scale warfare: "War was always a great evil, but in some particularly extreme circumstances, it may be the lesser of two evils."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Bertrand, "The Future of Pacifism", The American Scholar, (1943) 13: 7–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=I found the Nazis utterly revolting – cruel, bigoted, and stupid.

Before World War II, Russell taught at the [[University of Chicago]], later moving on to Los Angeles to lecture at the [[UCLA Department of Philosophy]]. He was appointed professor at the [[City College of New York]] (CCNY) in 1940, but after a public outcry the appointment was annulled by a court judgment that pronounced him "morally unfit" to teach at the college due to his opinions, especially those relating to [[sexual morality]], detailed in ''[[Marriage and Morals]]'' (1929). The matter was however taken to the [[New York Supreme Court]] by [[Jean Kay]] who was afraid that her daughter would be harmed by the appointment, though her daughter was not a student at CCNY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McCarthy | first = Joseph M. | title = The Russell Case: Academic Freedom vs. Public Hysteria | publisher = Educational Resources Information Center | date = May 1993 | pages = 9 | language = English | url = http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED363185.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many intellectuals, led by [[John Dewey]], protested at his treatment.&lt;ref name="Denied"&gt;{{cite news|title=Appointment Denied: The Inquisition of Bertrand Russell|author=Leberstein, Stephen|url=http://www.omnilogos.com/2015/01/appointment-denied-inquisition-of.html|publisher=Academe|date=November–December 2001|accessdate=17 February 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150123221826/http://www.omnilogos.com/2015/01/appointment-denied-inquisition-of.html|archive-date=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Einstein]]'s oft-quoted aphorism that "great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds" originated in his open letter, dated 19 March 1940, to [[Morris Raphael Cohen]], a professor emeritus at CCNY, supporting Russell's appointment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asl-associates.com/einsteinquotes.htm Einstein quotations and sources.]. Retrieved 9 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey and [[Horace M. Kallen]] edited a collection of articles on the CCNY affair in ''[[The Bertrand Russell Case]]''. Russell soon joined the [[Barnes Foundation]], lecturing to a varied audience on the history of philosophy; these lectures formed the basis of ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]''. His relationship with the eccentric [[Albert C. Barnes]] soon soured, and he returned to the UK in 1944 to rejoin the faculty of Trinity College.&lt;ref name="professor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bertrand Russell |url=http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophers/bertrand-russell.php |year=2006 |accessdate=17 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212100048/http://www.philosophyprofessor.com/philosophers/bertrand-russell.php |archivedate=12 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life===

Russell participated in many broadcasts over the BBC, particularly ''[[The Brains Trust]]'' and the [[BBC Third Programme|Third Programme]], on various topical and philosophical subjects. By this time Russell was world-famous outside academic circles, frequently the subject or author of magazine and newspaper articles, and was called upon to offer opinions on a wide variety of subjects, even mundane ones. En route to one of his lectures in [[Trondheim]], Russell was one of 24 survivors (among a total of 43 passengers) of an [[Bukken Bruse disaster|aeroplane crash in Hommelvik]] in October 1948. He said he owed his life to smoking since the people who drowned were in the non-smoking part of the plane.&lt;ref name="letters"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Selected Letters of Bertrand Russell|page=660|publisher=Routledge|author=Griffin, Nicholas (ed.)|year=2002|isbn=0-415-26012-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Autobiography|page=512|isbn=9780415189859|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlMrmmrNuEoC|author=Bertrand Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[A History of Western Philosophy]]'' (1945) became a best-seller and provided Russell with a steady income for the remainder of his life.

In 1942 Russell argued in favour of a moderate socialism, capable of overcoming its metaphysical principles, in an inquiry on [[dialectical materialism]], launched by the Austrian artist and philosopher [[Wolfgang Paalen]] in his journal ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]'', saying "I think the metaphysics of both [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]] plain nonsense – Marx's claim to be 'science' is no more justified than [[Mary Baker Eddy]]'s. This does not mean that I am opposed to socialism."&lt;ref&gt;Russell to Edward Renouf, assistant of [[Wolfgang Paalen]], 23 March 1942 (Succession Wolfgang Paalen, Berlin); this letter is cited in ''DYN'', No. 2, Mexico, July–August 1942, p.&amp;nbsp;52&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, Russell expressed support for [[Zionism]]: "I have come gradually to see that, in a dangerous and largely hostile world, it is essential to [[Jews]] to have some country which is theirs, some region where they are not suspected aliens, some state which embodies what is distinctive in their culture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Quote/Russell_On_Zionism.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304040128/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Quote/Russell_On_Zionism.html |archivedate=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech in 1948, Russell said that if the [[Soviet Union|USSR]]'s aggression continued, it would be morally worse to go to war after the USSR possessed an [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] than before it possessed one, because if the USSR had no bomb the West's victory would come more swiftly and with fewer casualties than if there were atom bombs on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouth.edu/department/history-philosophy/files/2012/10/Bertrand-Russell-and-Preventive-War.pdf |title=Bertrand Russell and Preventive War |format=PDF |website=Plymouth.edu |date= |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/books/PrinterFriendly.cfm?Story_ID=699582|work=The Economist|title=A philosopher's letters&amp;nbsp;– Love, Bertie | date=21 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, only the United States possessed an atomic bomb, and the USSR was pursuing an extremely aggressive policy towards the countries in Eastern Europe which were being absorbed into the Soviet Union's [[sphere of influence]]. Many understood Russell's comments to mean that Russell approved of a [[first strike]] in a war with the USSR, including [[Nigel Lawson]], who was present when Russell spoke of such matters. Others, including Griffin, who obtained a transcript of the speech, have argued that he was merely explaining the usefulness of America's atomic arsenal in deterring the USSR from continuing its domination of Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="letters" /&gt;
However, just after the atomic bombs exploded over [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki]], Russell wrote letters, and published articles in newspapers from 1945 to 1948, stating clearly that it was morally justified and better to go to war against the USSR using atomic bombs while the United States possessed them and before the USSR did. In September 1949, one week after the USSR tested its first A-bomb, but before this became known, Russell wrote that USSR would be unable to develop nuclear weapons because following Stalin's purges only science based on Marxist principles would be practiced in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;He wrote: "There is reason to think Stalin will insist on a new orthodoxy in atomic physics, since there is much in quantum theory that runs contrary to Communist dogma. An atomic bomb' made on Marxist principles would probably not explode because, after all, Marxist science was that of a hundred years ago. For those who fear the military power of Russia there is, therefore, some reason to rejoice in the muzzling of Russian science." Russell, Bertrand "Stalin Declares War on Science"&amp;nbsp; Review of Langdon-Davies,&amp;nbsp;''Russia Puts Back the Clock'',&amp;nbsp;''Evening Standard''&amp;nbsp;(London), Sep 7 1949, p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt; After it became known that the USSR carried out [[List of nuclear weapons tests of the Soviet Union|its nuclear bomb tests]], Russell declared his position advocating for the total abolition of atomic weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bertrand-Russell-Ronald-William-Clark/dp/0394490592/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=undefined&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=clark+life+bertrand+russell|title=The life of Bertrand Russell: Ronald William Clark: 9780394490595: Amazon.com: Books|publisher=Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, Russell was invited by the BBC to deliver the inaugural [[Reith Lectures]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=–06:04|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00729d9|title=Radio 4 Programmes – The Reith Lectures|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;—what was to become an annual series of lectures, still broadcast by the BBC. His series of six broadcasts, titled ''Authority and the Individual'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=–06:04|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00h9lz3|title=Radio 4 Programmes – The Reith Lectures: Bertrand Russell: Authority and the Individual: 1948|publisher=BBC|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; explored themes such as the role of individual initiative in the development of a community and the role of state control in a progressive society. Russell continued to write about philosophy. He wrote a foreword to ''Words and Things'' by [[Ernest Gellner]], which was highly critical of the later thought of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and of [[ordinary language philosophy]]. [[Gilbert Ryle]] refused to have the book reviewed in the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', which caused Russell to respond via ''[[The Times]]''. The result was a month-long correspondence in ''The Times'' between the supporters and detractors of ordinary language philosophy, which was only ended when the paper published an editorial critical of both sides but agreeing with the opponents of ordinary language philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;T. P. Uschanov, [http://www.helsinki.fi/~tuschano/writings/strange/ The Strange Death of Ordinary Language Philosophy]. The controversy has been described by the writer [[Ved Mehta]] in ''Fly and the Fly Bottle'' (1963).&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[King's Birthday Honours]] of 9 June 1949, Russell was awarded the [[Order of Merit (Commonwealth)|Order of Merit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38628 |supp=y|page=2796|date=3 June 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]].&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nobel prize"/&gt; When he was given the Order of Merit, [[George VI]] was affable but slightly embarrassed at decorating a former jailbird, saying, "You have sometimes behaved in a manner that would not do if generally adopted".&lt;ref&gt;Ronald W. Clark, Bertrand Russell and His World, p.&amp;nbsp;94. (1981) {{isbn|0-500-13070-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell merely smiled, but afterwards claimed that the reply "That's right, just like your [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|brother]]" immediately came to mind. In 1952 Russell was divorced by Spence, with whom he had been very unhappy. Conrad, Russell's son by Spence, did not see his father between the time of the divorce and 1968 (at which time his decision to meet his father caused a permanent breach with his mother).

In 1950, Russell attended the inaugural conference for the [[Congress for Cultural Freedom]], a [[C.I.A.]]-funded anti-communist organization committed to the deployment of culture as a weapon during the [[Cold War]]&lt;ref&gt;Frances Stonor Saunders, "The Cultural Cold War: The CIA and the World of Arts and Letters." New York Press, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;. Russell was one of the best known patrons of the Congress, until he resigned in 1956&lt;ref&gt; Frances Stonor Saunder, ""The Cultural Cold War: The CIA And the World of Arts and Letters." New York Press, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell married his fourth wife, [[Edith Finch Russell|Edith Finch]], soon after the divorce, on 15 December 1952. They had known each other since 1925, and Edith had taught English at Bryn Mawr College near Philadelphia, sharing a house for 20 years with Russell's old friend [[Lucy Donnelly]]. Edith remained with him until his death, and, by all accounts, their marriage was a happy, close, and loving one. Russell's eldest son John suffered from serious [[mental illness]], which was the source of ongoing disputes between Russell and his former wife Dora.

In September 1961, at the age of 89, Russell was jailed for seven days in [[HM Prison Brixton|Brixton Prison]] for "breach of peace" after taking part in [[Committee of 100 (United Kingdom)#1961|an anti-nuclear demonstration]] in London. The magistrate offered to exempt him from jail if he pledged himself to "good behaviour", to which Russell replied: "No, I won't."&lt;ref&gt;Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation, ''Bertrand Russell, 1872–1970'' [1970], p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell, Vol. 3|page=157|publisher=Little, Brown|author=Russell, Bertrand|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 Russell played a public role in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis#Crisis deepens|Cuban Missile Crisis]]: in an exchange of telegrams with Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]], Khrushchev assured him that the Soviet government would not be reckless.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|title=World Peace Efforts Since Gandhi|author=Sanderson Beck|accessdate=24 June 2012|url=http://www.san.beck.org/GPJ24-Russell,Muste.html|chapter=Pacifism of Bertrand Russell and A. J. Muste|publisher=Sanderson Beck|year=2003–2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell sent this telegram to [[John F. Kennedy|President Kennedy]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;YOUR ACTION DESPERATE. THREAT TO HUMAN SURVIVAL. NO CONCEIVABLE JUSTIFICATION. CIVILIZED MAN CONDEMNS IT. WE WILL NOT HAVE MASS MURDER. ULTIMATUM MEANS WAR... END THIS MADNESS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Kennedys: Dynasty and Disaster|author=John H. Davis|publisher=S. P. Books|page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to historian Peter Knight, after JFK's [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination]], Russell, "prompted by the emerging work of the lawyer [[Mark Lane (author)|Mark Lane]] in the US ... rallied support from other noteworthy and left-leaning compatriots to form a Who Killed Kennedy Committee in June 1964, members of which included [[Michael Foot]] MP, [[Caroline Benn]], the publisher [[Victor Gollancz]], the writers [[John Arden]] and [[J. B. Priestley]], and the Oxford history professor [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]]." Russell published a highly critical article weeks before the [[Warren Commission]] Report was published, setting forth ''16 Questions on the Assassination'' and equating the Oswald case with the [[Dreyfus affair]] of late 19th-century France, in which the state wrongly convicted an innocent man. Russell also criticised the American press for failing to heed any voices critical of the official version.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Knight, ''The Kennedy Assassination'', Edinburgh University Press Ltd., 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political causes===
[[File:Bertrand Russell leads anti-nuclear march in London, Feb 1961.jpg|thumb|left|Russell (centre) alongside his wife Edith, leading a [[CND]] anti-nuclear march in London, 18 February 1961]]
Bertrand Russell was opposed to war from early on, his opposition to World War I being used as grounds for his dismissal from Trinity College at Cambridge. This incident fused two of his most controversial causes, as he had failed to be granted Fellow status, which would have protected him from firing, because he was not willing to either pretend to be a devout Christian, or at least avoid admitting he was agnostic.

He later described the resolution of these issues as essential to freedom of thought and expression, citing the incident in [[Free Thought and Official Propaganda]], where he explained that the expression of any idea, even the most obviously "bad", must be protected not only from direct State intervention, but also economic leveraging and other means of being silenced:

{{quote|The opinions which are still persecuted strike the majority as so monstrous and immoral that the general principle of toleration cannot be held to apply to them.

But this is exactly the same view as that which made possible the tortures of the Inquisition.&lt;ref name="free"&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/44932/44932-h/44932-h.htm Free Thought and Official Propaganda]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Russell spent the 1950s and 1960s engaged in political causes primarily related to [[nuclear disarmament]] and opposing the [[Vietnam War]]. The 1955 [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto]] was a document calling for nuclear disarmament and was signed by eleven of the most prominent nuclear physicists and intellectuals of the time.&lt;ref name="Manifesto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Russell Einstein Manifesto|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/texts/doc_russelleinstein_manif.html|author=Russell, Bertrand|author2=[[Albert Einstein]] |date=9 July 1955|accessdate=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966–1967, Russell worked with [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and many other intellectual figures to form the [[Russell Tribunal|Russell Vietnam War Crimes Tribunal]] to investigate the conduct of the United States in Vietnam.  He wrote a great many letters to world leaders during this period.

In 1956, immediately before and during the [[Suez Crisis]], Russell expressed his opposition to European imperialism in the Middle East. He viewed the crisis as another reminder of the  pressing need for a more effective mechanism for international governance, and to restrict national sovereignty to places such as the [[Suez Canal]] area "where general interest is involved". At the same time the Suez Crisis was taking place, the world was also captivated by the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] and the subsequent crushing of the revolt by intervening Soviet forces. Russell attracted criticism for speaking out fervently against the Suez war while ignoring Soviet repression in Hungary, to which he responded that he did not criticise the Soviets "because there was no need. Most of the so-called Western World was fulminating". Although he later feigned a lack of concern, at the time he was disgusted by the brutal Soviet response, and on 16 November 1956, he expressed approval for a declaration of support for Hungarian scholars which [[Michael Polanyi]] had cabled to the Soviet embassy in London twelve days previously, shortly after Soviet troops had already entered Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;''Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell'' (Psychology Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1957 Russell wrote an article addressing US President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]], urging a summit to consider "the conditions of co-existence". Khrushchev responded that peace could indeed be served by such a meeting. In January 1958 Russell elaborated his views in ''[[The Observer]]'', proposing a cessation of all nuclear-weapons production, with the UK taking the first step by unilaterally suspending its own nuclear-weapons program if necessary, and with Germany "freed from all alien armed forces and pledged to neutrality in any conflict between East and West". US Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]] replied for Eisenhower. The exchange of letters was published as ''The Vital Letters of Russell, Khrushchev, and Dulles''.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;''Yours Faithfully, Bertrand Russell'' (pp. 212–213)&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell was asked by ''[[The New Republic]]'', a liberal American magazine, to elaborate his views on world peace. He urged that all nuclear-weapons testing and constant flights by planes armed with nuclear weapons be halted immediately, and negotiations be opened for the destruction of all [[Thermonuclear weapon|hydrogen bombs]], with the number of conventional nuclear devices limited to ensure a balance of power. He proposed that Germany be reunified and accept the [[Oder-Neisse line]] as its border, and that a neutral zone be established in Central Europe, consisting at the minimum of Germany, Poland, [[Hungary]], and [[Czechoslovakia]], with each of these countries being free of foreign troops and influence, and prohibited from forming alliances with countries outside the zone. In the Middle East, Russell suggested that the West avoid opposing [[Arab nationalism]], and proposed the creation of a United Nations peacekeeping force to guard Israel's frontiers to ensure that Israel was prevented from committing aggression and protected from it. He also suggested Western recognition of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], and that it be admitted to the UN with a permanent seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]].&lt;ref name=ref1/&gt;

He was in contact with [[Lionel Rogosin]] while the latter was filming his anti-war film ''[[Good Times, Wonderful Times]]'' in the 1960s. He became a hero to many of the youthful members of the [[New Left]]. In early 1963, in particular, Russell became increasingly vocal in his disapproval of the [[Vietnam War]], and felt that the US government's policies there were near-[[genocide|genocidal]]. In 1963 he became the inaugural recipient of the [[Jerusalem Prize]], an award for writers concerned with the freedom of the individual in society.&lt;ref name="jerusalem prize"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerusalembookfair.com/main.html|title=Jerusalem International Book Fair|publisher=Jerusalembookfair.com|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 he was one of eleven world figures who issued an appeal to Israel and the [[Arab world|Arab countries]] to accept an [[arms embargo]] and international supervision of nuclear plants and rocket weaponry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1964/02/26/archive/bertrand-russell-appeals-to-arabs-and-israel-on-rocket-weapons|title=Bertrand Russell Appeals to Arabs and Israel on Rocket Weapons|work=Jewish Telegraphic Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1965 he tore up his [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] card because he suspected [[Harold Wilson]]'s Labour government was going to send troops to support the United States in Vietnam.&lt;ref name="Gallery"/&gt;

===Final years and death===
In June 1955 Russell had leased Plas Penrhyn in [[Penrhyndeudraeth]], Merionethshire, Wales and on 5 July of the following year it became his and Edith's principal residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Andrew G.

[[File:Bust Of Bertrand Russell-Red Lion Square-London.jpg|thumb|Bust of Russell in [[Red Lion Square]]]]
Russell published his three-volume autobiography in 1967, 1968, and 1969. Russell made a [[cameo appearance]] playing himself in the anti-war [[Hindi]] film [[Aman (film)|''Aman'']], by [[Mohan Kumar]], which was released in India in 1967. This was Russell's only appearance in a feature film.&lt;ref name="Bertrand Russell in Bollywood"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0233193/|title=Aman (1967)|publisher=Internet Movie Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 November 1969 he wrote to ''The Times'' newspaper saying that the preparation for show trials in [[Czechoslovakia]] was "highly alarming". The same month, he appealed to Secretary General [[U Thant]] of the United Nations to support an international war crimes commission to investigate alleged torture and genocide by the United States in [[South Vietnam]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. The following month, he protested to [[Alexei Kosygin]] over the expulsion of [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] from the [[Soviet Union of Writers]].

On 31 January 1970 Russell issued a statement condemning "Israel's aggression in the Middle East", and in particular, Israeli bombing raids being carried out deep in Egyptian territory as part of the [[War of Attrition]]. He called for an Israeli withdrawal to the pre-[[Six-Day War]] borders. This was Russell's final political statement or act. It was read out at the International Conference of Parliamentarians in [[Cairo]] on 3 February 1970, the day after his death.&lt;ref name="Last Message"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.connexions.org/CxLibrary/Docs/CX5576-RussellMidEast.htm |title=Bertrand Russell's Last Message |website=Connexions.org |date=1970-01-31 |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell died of [[influenza]] on 2 February 1970 at his home in Penrhyndeudraeth. His body was cremated in [[Colwyn Bay]] on 5 February 1970. In accordance with his will, there was no religious ceremony; his ashes were scattered over the Welsh mountains later that year. He left an estate valued at £69,423 (£1.09 million or US$1.4 million in 2018 money).&lt;ref&gt;[https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk/Calendar?surname=Russell&amp;yearOfDeath=1970&amp;page=3#calendar Russell, 1970, p.&amp;nbsp;3] at probatesearch.service.gov.uk.

===Philosophy===
{{Main|Bertrand Russell's philosophical views}}
Russell is generally credited with being one of the founders of [[analytic philosophy]]. He was deeply impressed by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] (1646–1716), and wrote on every major area of philosophy except [[aesthetics]]. He was particularly prolific in the field of [[metaphysics]], the [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Logic and philosophy of mathematics|logic and the philosophy of mathematics]], the [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Philosophy of language|philosophy of language]], [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Ethics|ethics]] and [[Bertrand Russell's views on philosophy#Epistemology|epistemology]]. When [[Brand Blanshard]] asked Russell why he did not write on aesthetics, Russell replied that he did not know anything about it, "but that is not a very good excuse, for my friends tell me it has not deterred me from writing on other subjects".&lt;ref&gt;Blanshard, in [[Paul Arthur Schilpp]], ed., ''The Philosophy of Brand Blanshard'', Open Court, 1980, p.&amp;nbsp;88, quoting a private letter from Russell.&lt;/ref&gt;

On ethics, Russell considered himself a [[utilitarian]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell'', London: Routledge, 2000 [London: Allen and Unwin, 1969, Vol. 1], p.&amp;nbsp;39 ("It appeared to me obvious that the happiness of mankind should be the aim of all action, and I discovered to my surprise that there were those who thought otherwise. Belief in happiness, I found, was called Utilitarianism, and was merely one among a number of ethical theories. I adhered to it after this discovery.").&lt;/ref&gt;

For the advancement of science ''and'' protection of the right to freedom of expression, Russell advocated [[The Will to Doubt]], the recognition that all human knowledge is at most a best guess, that one should always remember:

{{quote|''None of our beliefs are quite true; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error''. The methods of increasing the degree of truth in our beliefs are well known; they consist in hearing all sides, trying to ascertain all the relevant facts, controlling our own bias by discussion with people who have the opposite bias, and cultivating a readiness to discard any hypothesis which has proved inadequate. These methods are practised in science, and have built up the body of scientific knowledge.

''Every man of science whose outlook is truly scientific is ready to admit that what passes for scientific knowledge at the moment is sure to require correction with the progress of discovery; nevertheless, it is near enough to the truth to serve for most practical purposes, though not for all. In science, where alone something approximating to genuine knowledge is to be found, men’s attitude is tentative and full of doubt''.}}

===Religion===
Russell described himself in 1947 as an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]], saying: "Therefore, in regard to the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympic gods]], speaking to a purely philosophical audience, I would say that I am an Agnostic. But speaking popularly, I think that all of us would say in regard to those gods that we were Atheists. In regard to the [[God in Christianity|Christian God]], I should, I think, take exactly the same line."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell8.htm |title=Am I An Atheist or an Agnostic? |last=Russell |first=Bertrand |year=1947 |work=Encyclopedia of Things |accessdate=6 July 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050622001026/http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/russell8.htm |archivedate=22 June 2005 |df=dmy }}: "I never know whether I should say "Agnostic" or whether I should say "Atheist"... As a philosopher, if I were speaking to a purely philosophic audience I should say that I ought to describe myself as an Agnostic, because I do not think that there is a conclusive argument by which one prove (sic) that there is not a God. On the other hand, if I am to convey the right impression to the ordinary man in the street I think I ought to say that I am an Atheist..."&lt;/ref&gt; For most of his adult life, Russell maintained religion to be little more than [[superstition]] and, in spite of any positive effects, largely harmful to people. He believed that religion and the religious outlook serve to impede knowledge and foster fear and dependency, and to be responsible for much of our world's wars, oppression, and misery. He was a member of the Advisory Council of the [[British Humanist Association]] and President of Cardiff Humanists until his death.&lt;ref&gt;'Humanist News', March 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society===
{{Main|Bertrand Russell's views on society}}
Political and social activism occupied much of Russell's time for most of his life. Russell remained politically active almost to the end of his life, writing to and exhorting world leaders and lending his name to various causes.

Russell argued for a "scientific society", where war would be abolished, population growth would be limited, and prosperity would be shared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Impact of Science on Society|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|chapter=Conclusions|year=1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested the establishment of a "single supreme world government" able to enforce peace,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Which Way to Peace? ''(Part 12)''|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|page=173|publisher=M. Joseph Ltd.|year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that "the only thing that will redeem mankind is co-operation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Human Society in Ethics and Politics|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|page=212|publisher=London: G. Allen &amp; Unwin|year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell was an active supporter of the [[Homosexual Law Reform Society]], being one of the signatories of [[A. E. Dyson]]'s 1958 letter to ''The Times'' calling for a change in the law regarding male homosexual practices, which were partly legalised in 1967, when Russell was still alive.&lt;ref name="GALHA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesbian and Gay Rights: The Humanist and Religious Stances|url=http://www.galha.org/briefing/lgb_rights.html|author=Gay and Lesbian Humanist Association|date=2 November 1997|accessdate=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Reflections on My Eightieth Birthday" ("Postscript" in his ''Autobiography''), Russell wrote: "I have lived in the pursuit of a vision, both personal and social. Personal: to care for what is noble, for what is beautiful, for what is gentle; to allow moments of insight to give wisdom at more mundane times. Social: to see in imagination the society that is to be created, where individuals grow freely, and where hate and greed and envy die because there is nothing to nourish them. These things I believe, and the world, for all its horrors, has left me unshaken".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Autobiography of Bertrand Russell: 1944–1969|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|page=330|publisher=Little, Brown|year=1968}} Published separately as 'Reflections on My Eightieth Birthday' in ''Portraits from Memory''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russell was the author of more than sixty books and over two thousand articles.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Pigden in Bertrand Russell, ''Russell on Ethics: Selections from the Writings of Bertrand Russell'', Routledge (2013), p.&amp;nbsp;14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James C. Klagge, ''Wittgenstein: Biography and Philosophy'', Cambridge University Press (2001), p.&amp;nbsp;12&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, he wrote many pamphlets, introductions, and letters to the editor. One pamphlet titled, '''I Appeal unto Caesar': The Case of the Conscientious Objectors'', ghostwritten for Margaret Hobhouse, the mother of imprisoned peace activist [[Stephen Hobhouse]], allegedly helped secure the release from prison of hundreds of [[conscientious objector]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hochschild |first=Adam |title=To end all wars: a story of loyalty and rebellion, 1914–1918 |pages=270–272 |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |year=2011 |isbn=0-618-75828-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His works can be found in anthologies and collections, including ''The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell'', which [[McMaster University]] began publishing in 1983. By March 2017 this collection of his shorter and previously unpublished works included 18 volumes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russell.mcmaster.ca/brworks.htm |title=McMaster University: The Bertrand Russell Research Centre |website=Russell.mcmaster.ca |date=2017-03-06 |accessdate=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several more are in progress. A bibliography in three additional volumes catalogues his publications. The Russell Archives held by McMaster's [[William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections]] possess over 40,000 of his letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bertrand Russell Archives Catalogue Entry and Research System|url=https://bracers.mcmaster.ca/|website=McMaster University Library|publisher=The William Ready Division of Archives and Research Collections|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The techniques of bioremediation of environmental areas as [[soil]], [[water]] and [[sediments]] contaminated by radionuclides are diverse and currently being set up as an ecological and economic alternative to traditional procedures. Physico-chemical conventional strategies are based on the extraction of waste by excavating and drilling, with a subsequent long-range transport for their final confinement. These works and transport have often unacceptable estimated [[cost of operation|costs of operation]] that could exceed a [[Trillion (short scale)|trillion]] [[United States dollar|dollars]] in the [[US]] and 50 [[million]] [[Pound sterling|pounds]] in the [[UK]].&lt;ref name="prakash"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3917470/pdf/mbt20006-0349.pdf|title=Bioremediation: a genuine technology to remediate radionuclides from the environment|last1=Prakash|first1=D|last2=Gabani|first2=P|last3=Chandel|first3=A.K|last4=Ronen|first4=Z|last5=Singh|first5=O.V|journal=Microbial Biotechnology|year= 2013|volume=6|issue=4|doi=10.1111/1751-7915.12059|pages=349–360|pmc=3917470|format=PDF|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|place=New York|pmid=23617701}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The species involved in these processes have the ability to influence the properties of radionuclides such as [[solubility]], [[bioavailability]] and [[Motion (physics)|mobility]] to accelerate its stabilization. Its action is largely influenced by [[electron donors]] and [[electron acceptors|acceptors]], [[nutrient medium]], complexation of radioactive particles with the material and [[environmental factors]]. These are measures that can be performed on the source of contamination (''[[in situ]]'') or in controlled and limited facilities in order to follow the [[biological process]] more accurately and combine it with other systems (''[[ex situ]]'').&lt;ref name="newsome"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0009254113004907/1-s2.0-S0009254113004907-main.pdf?_tid=1e19ef28-1ed2-11e6-a426-00000aab0f02&amp;acdnat=1463780027_d2587d314497c03d719dde123928563f|title=The biogeochemistry and bioremediation of uranium and other priority radionuclides|first1=L|last1=Newsome|last2=Morris|first2=K|last3=Lloyd|first3=J.R|year=2014|doi=10.1016/j.chemgeo.2013.10.034|journal=Chemical Geology|publisher=Elsevier|volume=363|pages=164–184|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="in situ"&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275329686_In_situ_and_ex_situ_bioremediation_of_radionuclide-contaminated_soils_at_nuclear_and_NORM_sites|chapter=9.

===Typology of radionuclides and polluting waste===
{{main|Radioactive waste}}
The presence of radioactive waste in the environment may cause long-term effects due to the [[Specific activity|activity]] and [[Biological half-life|half-life]] of the radionuclides, leading their impact to grow with time.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt; These particles exist in various [[oxidation states]] and are found as [[oxides]], [[coprecipitation|coprecipitates]], or as [[organic chemical|organic]] or [[inorganic chemical|inorganic]] complexes, according to their origin and ways of liberation. Most commonly they are found in oxidized form, which makes them more soluble in water and thus more mobile.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt; Unlike organic contaminants, however, they cannot be destroyed and must be converted into a stable form or extracted from the environment.&lt;ref name="brookhaven"&gt;{{cite conference|url=https://www.bnl.gov/isd/documents/32628.pdf|title=Microbial Transformations of Radionuclides and Environmental Restoration Through Bioremediation|date=2006|conference=Symposium on "Emerging Trends in Separation Science and Technology"|publisher=[[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]|first=A.J|last=Francis|format=PDF|place=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sources of radioactivity are not exclusive of human activity. The [[natural radioactivity]] does not come from human sources: it covers up to ¾ of the total radioactivity in the world and has its origins in the interaction of terrestrial elements with high energy [[cosmic rays]] ([[cosmogenic nuclide|cosmogenic radionuclides]]) or in the existing materials on [[Earth]] since its formation ([[primordial nuclide|primordial radionuclides]]). In this regard, there are differences in the levels of radioactivity throughout the [[Earth's crust]]. [[India]] and mountains like the [[Alps]] are among the areas with the highest level of natural radioactivity due to their composition of [[rocks]] and [[sand]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csn.es/radiacion-natural-y-artificial2|title=Radiación natural y artificial|format=Web|author=Consejo de Seguridad Nuclear|editor=[[Ministry of Industry (Spain)|Ministerio de Industria, Turismo y Comercio de España]]|access-date=24 February 2016|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most frequent radionuclides in soils are naturally [[radium-226]] (&lt;sup&gt;226&lt;/sup&gt;Ra), [[radon-222]] (&lt;sup&gt;222&lt;/sup&gt;Rn), [[thorium-232]] (&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th), [[uranium-238]] (&lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U) and [[potassium-40]] (&lt;sup&gt;40&lt;/sup&gt;K). Potassium-40 (up to 88% of total activity), [[carbon-14]] (&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C), [[radium-226]], [[uranium-238]] and [[rubidium-87]] (&lt;sup&gt;87&lt;/sup&gt;Rb) are found in [[ocean]] waters. Moreover, in [[groundwater]] abound radius radioisotopes such as radium-226 and [[radium-228]] (&lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Ra).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Naturally occurring radionuclides in the marine environment: an overview of current knowledge with emphasis on the North Sea area|publisher=Norse Decom AS|year=2003|isbn=82-92538-01-1|first1=P|last1=Varskog|first2=E|last2=Stralberg|first3=A.T.S|last3=Varskog|first4=A|last4=Raaum|format=PDF|page=7|place=Kjeller|url=http://dom.cat/rzw}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="idaho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.isu.edu/radinf/natural.htm|title=Radioactivity in Nature|editor=[[Idaho State University]]|format=Web|access-date=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also habitual in [[building materials]] radionuclides of uranium, thorium and potassium (the latter common to [[wood]]).&lt;ref name="idaho"/&gt;

At the same time, [[anthropogenic nuclide|anthropogenic radionuclides]] (caused by humans) are due to [[thermonuclear reaction]]s resulting from [[Effects of nuclear explosions|explosions]] and [[nuclear weapons]] tests, discharges from [[nuclear facility|nuclear facilities]], accidents deriving from the reprocessing of commercial [[fuel]], waste storage from these processes and to a lesser extent, [[nuclear medicine]].&lt;ref name="hu"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0265931X08001392|title=Sources of anthropogenic radionuclides in the environment: a review|first1=Q|last1=Hu|first2=J|last2=Weng|first3=J|last3=Wang|format=Web|journal=Journal of Environmental Radioactivity|volume=101|issue=6|year=2010|pages=426–437|doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2008.08.004|publisher=Elsevier|place=Arlington}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some polluted sites by these radionuclides are the [[US DOE]] facilities (like [[Hanford Site]]), the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone|Chernobyl]] and [[Japanese reaction to Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] [[exclusion zone]]s and the affected area of [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]] due to the [[Kyshtym disaster]].

The classification of radioactive waste established by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) distinguishes six levels according to [[equivalent dose]], [[specific activity]], [[heat]] released and [[half-life]] of the radionuclides:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1419_web.pdf|title=Classification of radioactive waste: general safety guide|issue=nº GSG-1|author=Vienna International Centre|journal=IAEA safety standards series|issn=1020-525X|isbn=9789201092090|publisher=[[International Atomic Energy Agency]]|place=Viena|year=2009|format=PDF|pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Exempt waste (EW)''': Waste that meets the criteria for exclusion from regulatory control for radiation protection purposes.
*'''Very short lived waste (VSLW)''': Waste with very short half-lives (often used for research and medical purposes) that can be stored over a limited period of up to a few years and subsequently cleared from regulatory control.
*'''Very low level waste (VLLW)''': Waste like soil and [[rubble]] (with low levels of activity concentration) that may also contain other hazardous waste.
*'''Low level waste (LLW)''': Waste that is above clearance levels and requires robust isolation and containment for periods of up to a few hundred years and is suitable for disposal in engineered near surface facilities. LLW include short lived radionuclides at higher levels of activity concentration and also long lived radionuclides, but only at relatively low levels of activity concentration.
*'''Intermediate level waste (ILW)''': Waste with long lived radionuclides that requires a greater degree of containment and isolation at greater depths.
*'''High level waste (HLW)''': Waste with large amounts of long lived radionuclides that need to be stored in deep, stable [[geological formations]] usually several hundred metres or more below the surface.

=== Ecological and human health consequences ===
[[File:Deformity of Hand due to X-ray burns.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Deformity of hand due to an [[X-ray]] burn.]]
Radioactive contamination is a potential danger for living organisms and results in external hazards, concerning radiation sources outside the body, and internal dangers, as a result of the incorporation of radionuclides inside the body (often by [[inhalation]] of particles or [[ingestion]] of [[contaminated food]]).&lt;ref name="chemistry"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WE7DeP21BhcC&amp;pg=PP16&amp;dq=biological+effects+of+radioactive+pollution&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikwtWx4JjLAhVC0hoKHWz8DZEQ6AEIGTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=biological%20effects%20of%20radioactive%20pollution&amp;f=false|title=Environmental Chemistry|chapter=Effects of radioactive pollution|isbn=9788182830127|editor1-first=B.K|editor1-last=Sharma|publisher=Krishna Prakashan Media|place=Meerut|year=2007|first1=B.K|last1=Sharma|first2=A|last2=Sharma|first3=M|last3=Sharma|format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In humans, single doses from 0.25 [[Sievert|Sv]] produce first anomalies in the amount of [[leukocytes]]. This effect is accentuated if the [[absorbed dose]] is between 0.5 and 2 Sv, in whose first damage, [[nausea]] and [[hair loss]] are suffered. The strip ranging between 2 and 5 Sv is considered the most serious and include [[bleeding]], [[ulcers]] and risk of [[death]]; values exceeding 5 Sv involve immediate death.&lt;ref name="chemistry"/&gt; If radiation, likewise, is received in small doses over long periods of time, the consequences can be equally severe. It is difficult to quantify the health effects for doses below 10 [[mSv]], but it has been shown that there is a direct relationship between prolonged exposure and [[cancer]] risk (although there is not a very clear dose-response relationship to establish clear limits of exposure).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cancer risks attributable to low doses of ionizing radiation: Assessing what we really know|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/100/24/13761.full.pdf|last1=Brenner|first1=D.J|last2=Doll|first2=R|first3=D.T|last3=Goodhead|first4=E.J|last4=Hall|first5=C.E|last5=Land|journal=PNAS|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|volume=100|issue=24|pages=13761–13766|format=PDF|doi=10.1073/pnas.2235592100|issn=1091-6490|year=2003|pmid=14610281|pmc=283495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The information available on the effect of natural background radiation with respect anthropogenic pollution on [[wildlife]] is scarce and refers to very few species. It is very difficult to estimate from the available data the total doses that can accumulate during specific stages of the [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] ([[embryonic development]] or reproductive age), in changes in [[behavior]] or depending on [[environmental factors]] such as [[seasonality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/39102681720.pdf|format=PDF|title=Radiation &amp; the environment: Assessing effects on animals and plants|first1=G|last1=Linsley|journal=IAEA Bulletin|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomena of radioactive [[bioaccumulation]], [[bioconcentration]] and [[biomagnification]], however, are especially known to sea level. They are caused by the recruitment and retention of radioisotopes by [[bivalves]], [[crustaceans]], [[corals]] and [[phytoplankton]], which then amounted to the rest of the [[food chain]] at low concentration factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=8.

== Bacterial bioremediation ==
The biochemical transformation of radionuclides into stable isotopes by [[bacteria|bacterial species]] significantly differs from the metabolism of [[organic compounds]] coming from carbon sources. They are highly energetic radioactive forms which can be converted indirectly by the process of microbial [[energy transfer]].&lt;ref name="nabir"/&gt;

Radioisotopes can be transformed directly through changes in [[valence (chemistry)|valence state]] by acting as [[electron acceptor|acceptors]] or by acting as [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] to [[enzymes]]. They can also be transformed indirectly by [[reducing agent|reducing]] and [[oxidizing agents]] produced by microorganisms that cause changes in [[pH]] or [[redox potential]]. Other processes include [[precipitation]] and complexation of [[surfactants,]] or [[chelating agents]] that bind to radioactive elements. Human intervention, on the other hand, can improve these processes through [[genetic engineering]] and [[omics]], or by injection of microorganisms or [[nutrients]] into the treatment area.&lt;ref name="nabir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brookhaven"/&gt;

===Bioreduction===
{{main|Biotransformation}}
According to the radioactive element and the specific site conditions, bacteria can enzymatically immobilize radionuclides directly or indirectly. Their [[redox potential]] is exploited by some microbial species to carry out reductions that alter the [[solubility]] and hence, mobility, [[bioavailability]] and [[radiotoxicity]]. This waste treatment technique called bioreduction or enzymatic biotransformation is very attractive because it can be done in mild conditions for the environment, does not produce hazardous secondary waste and has potential as a solution for waste of various kinds.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;

[[File:Enzymatic reduction of radionuclides (en).png|thumb|460px|right|Depiction of direct enzymatic reduction. Microorganisms use organic compounds as [[Lactic acid|lactate]], [[acetate]] or [[formate]] as [[electron donors]] to reduce and leave radionuclides in insoluble form.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="intech"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/applied-bioremediation-active-and-passive-approaches/bioremediation-of-radiotoxic-elements-under-natural-environmental-conditions|chapter=Chapter 8: Bioremediation of Radiotoxic Elements under Natural Environmental Conditions|last1=Mtimunye|first1=P.J|last2=Chirwa|first2=E.M.N|doi=10.5772/56909|isbn=978-953-51-1200-6|format=Web|title=Applied Bioremediation - Active and Passive Approaches|year=2013|publisher=Intech|editor1-first=B.P|editor1-last=Yogesh|editor2-first=P|editor2-last=Rao}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Direct enzymatic reduction is the change of radionuclides of a higher oxidation state to a lower one made by [[facultative anaerobe|facultative]] and [[obligate anaerobe]]s. The radioisotope interact with binding sites of metabolically active cells and is used as [[terminal electron acceptor]] in the [[electron transport chain]] where compounds such as [[ethyl lactate]] act as [[electron donors]] under [[anaerobic respiration]].&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;

The [[periplasm]] plays a very important role in these bioreductions. In the reduction of [[uranium]] (VI) to insoluble uranium (IV), made by ''[[Shewanella putrefaciens]]'', ''[[Desulfovibrio vulgaris]]'', ''[[Desulfovibrio desulfuricans]]'' and ''[[Geobacter sulfurreducens]]'', the activity of periplasmic [[cytochromes]] is required. The reduction of [[technetium]] (VII) to technetium (IV) made by ''S. putrefaciens'', ''G. sulfurreducens'', ''D. desulfuricans'', ''[[Geobacter metallireducens]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', on the other hand, requires the presence of the complex [[formate hydrogenlyase]], also placed in this cell compartment.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;

Other radioactive [[actinides]] such as [[thorium]], [[plutonium]], [[neptunium]] and [[americium]] are enzymatically reduced by ''[[Rhodoferax ferrireducens]]'', ''S. putrefaciens'' and several species of ''[[Geobacter]]'', and directly form an insoluble [[mineral]] phase.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;

The phenomenon of indirect enzymatic reduction is carried out by [[sulfate-reducing bacteria|sulfate-reducing]] and [[dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria]] on [[excretion]] reactions of [[metabolites]] and breakdown products. There is a coupling of the [[oxidation]] of [[organic acids]] —produced by the excretion of these [[Heterotroph|heterotrophic bacteria]]— with the reduction of [[iron]] or other [[metals]] and radionuclides, which forms insoluble compounds that can precipitate as [[oxide minerals|oxide]] and [[oxide minerals|hydroxide minerals]]. In the case of sulfate-reducing bacteria hydrogen sulfide is produced, promoting increased solubility of polluting radionuclides and their [[bioleaching]] (as liquid waste that can then be recovered).&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;

There are several species of reducing microorganisms that produce indirect [[sequestering agents]] and specific [[chelation|chelators]], such as [[siderophores]]. These sequestering agents are crucial in the complexation of radionuclides and increasing their solubility and bioavailability. ''[[Microbacterium flavescens]]'', for example, grows in the presence of radioisotopes such as plutonium, thorium, uranium or americium and produces organic acids and siderophores that allow the dissolution and mobilization of radionuclides through the soil. It seems that siderophores on bacterial surface could also facilitate the entry of these elements within the cell as well. ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' also secretes chelating agents out that meet uranium and thorium when grown in a medium with these elements. In general, it has also been found that [[enterobactin]] siderophores are extremely effective in solubilizing actinide oxides of plutonium.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;

==== Citrate complexes ====
[[Citrate]] is a chelator which binds to certain [[transition metals]] and radioactive actinides. Stable complexes such as [[denticity|bidentate]], [[denticity|tridentate]] (ligands with more than one atom bound) and polynuclear complexes (with several radioactive atoms) can be formed with citrate and radionuclides, which receive a microbial action. Anaerobically, ''[[Desulfovibrio desulfuricans]]'' and species of the genera ''[[Shewanella]]'' and ''[[Clostridium]]'' are able to reduce bidentate complexes of [[uranyl-citrate]] (VI) to uranyl-citrate (IV) and make them precipitate, despite not being able to degrade metabolically complexed citrate at the end of the process.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt; In denitrifying and aerobic conditions, however, it has been determined that it is not possible to reduce or degrade these uranium complexes. Bioreduction do not get a head when they are citrate complex mixed metal complexes or when they are tridentate, monomeric or polynuclear complexes, since they become [[recalcitrant]] and persistent in the environment.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=6.

=== Biosorption, bioaccumulation and biomineralization ===
[[File:Biosorption, biomineralization and bioaccumulation of radionuclides (en).png|500px|right|thumb| Biosorption, bioaccumulation and biomineralization strategies with a specific role for each cell compartment.&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;]]
{{main|Biosorption|Bioaccumulation|Biomineralization}}
The set of strategies that comprise biosorption, bioaccumulation and biomineralization are closely related to each other, because one way or another have a direct contact between the cell and radionuclide. These mechanisms are evaluated accurately using advanced analysis technologies such as [[electron microscopy]], [[X-ray diffraction]] and [[XANES]], [[EXAFS]] and [[X-ray spectroscopy|X-ray spectroscopies]].&lt;ref name="nabir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="phosphate"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ae/2014/786929/|title=Phosphate-Mediated Remediation of Metals and Radionuclides|format=Web|year=2014|journal=Advances in Ecology|publisher=Hindawi Publishing|doi=10.1155/2014/786929|first1=R.J|last1=Martinez|first2=M.J|last2=Beazley|first3=P.A|last3=Sobecky|volume=2014|pages=1–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biosorption and bioaccumulation are two metabolic actions that are based on the ability to concentrate radionuclides over a thousand times the concentration of the environment. They consist of complexation of radioactive waste with [[phosphates]], organic compounds and [[sulfites]] so that they become insoluble and less exposed to radiotoxicity. They are particularly useful in [[biosolids]] for [[agricultural]] purposes and [[soil amendments]], although most properties of these biosolids are unknown.&lt;ref name="developments"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11157-005-2170-y|title=Developments in bioremediation of soils and sediments polluted with metals and radionuclides: 2. Field research on bioremediation of metals and radionuclides|last1=Hazen|first1=T.C|last2=Tabak H.H|year=2005|journal=Reviews in Environmental Science and Bio/Technology|publisher=Springer|format=PDF|volume=4|issue=3|pages=157–183|doi=10.1007/s11157-005-2170-y|issn=1572-9826}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biosorption method is based on passive sequestration of positively charged radioisotopes by [[lipopolysaccharides]] (LPS) on the [[cell membrane]] (negatively charged), either live or dead bacteria. Its efficiency is directly related to the increase in temperature and can last for hours, being a much faster method than direct bioreduction. It occurs through the formation of [[biofilm|slimes]] and capsules, and with a preference for binding to the [[phosphate]] and [[phosphoryl]] groups (although it also occurs with [[carboxyl]], [[amine]] or [[sulfhydryl]] groups). ''[[Firmicutes]]'' and other bacteria like ''[[Citrobacter freudii]]'' have significant biosorption capabilities; ''[[Citrobacter]]'' does it through [[electrostatic interaction]] of uranium with phosphates of their LPS.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;

Quantitative analyzes determine that, in the case of uranium, biosorption may vary within a range between 45 and 615 [[milligrams]] per gram of cell [[dry weight]]. However, it is a technique that requires a high amount of biomass to affect bioremediation; it presents problems of [[binding site|saturation]] and other cations that compete for binding to the bacterial surface.&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;

Bioaccumulation refers to uptake of radionuclides into the cell, where they are retained by complexations with negatively charged intracellular components, precipitation or [[Granule (cell biology)|granules]] formations. Unlike biosorption, this is an [[Active transport|active process]]: it depends on an energy-dependent transport system.&lt;ref name="intech"/&gt; Some metals or radionuclides can be absorbed by bacteria accidentally because of its resemblance to [[dietary elements]] for [[metabolic pathways]]. Several radioisotopes of [[strontium]], for example, are recognized as analogs of [[calcium]] and incorporated within ''[[Micrococcus luteus]]''.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt; [[Uranium]], however, has no known function and is believed that its entry into the cell interior may be due to its toxicity (it is able to increase [[membrane permeability]]).&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;
[[File:Chernikovite 1.jpg|thumb|210px|left|[[Chernikovite]] and [[meta-autunite]], radioactive minerals result of possible biomineralization.]]
Furthermore, biomineralization —also known as bioprecipitation— is the [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of radionuclides through the generation of microbial ligands, resulting in the formation of stable [[Biogenic substance|biogenic minerals]]. These minerals have a very important role in the retention of radioactive contaminants. A very localized and produced enzymatically ligand concentration is involved and provides a [[nucleation site]] for the onset of biomineral precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=2.3 Biomineralization/Bioprecipitation|page=178|title=Radionuclides in the Environment: Influence of chemical speciation and plant uptake on radionuclide migration|first1=C|last1=Walther|first2=D.K|last2=Guptha|publisher=Springer|year=2015|isbn=9783319221717|place=Switzerland|format=Web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w7_YCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA178&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;dq=2.3+Biomineralization/Bioprecipitation&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=62v7XQuYZe&amp;sig=b5_UzK7BlkglRJ9woyMHnGCTiEs&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjcupqP2-_MAhWJDBoKHcbfAkkQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=2.3%20Biomineralization%2FBioprecipitation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly relevant in precipitations of [[phosphatase]] activity-derivate biominerals, which cleavage molecules such as [[glycerol phosphate]] on [[periplasm]]. In ''[[Citrobacter]]'' and ''[[Serratia]]'' genera, this cleavage liberates inorganic phosphates (HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;) that precipitates with uranyl ion (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and cause deposition of [[Crystallite|polycrystalline minerals]] around the cell wall.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=24.

Investigations of terrestrial and marine bacterial isolates belonging to the genera ''[[Aeromonas]]'', ''[[Bacillus]]'', ''[[Myxococcus]]'', ''[[Pantoea]]'', ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', ''[[Rahnella]]'' and ''[[Vibrio]]'' have also demonstrated the removal of uranium radioisotopes as phosphate biominerals in both [[oxygen|oxic]] and [[oxygen|anoxic]] growth conditions.&lt;ref name="phosphate"/&gt;

=== Biostimulation and bioaugmentation ===
{{main|Biostimulation|Bioaugmentation}}
[[File:Evolution of the Old Rifle Processing Site.jpeg|thumb|280px|right|Evolution of the Old Rifle [[Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action|UMTRA]] Site ([[Colorado]], [[US]]) from 1957 (above) until 2008 (below), in which biostimulation tasks were carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_graddiss/1895/|format=Web|title=In Situ Biostimulation of Uranium Reducing Microorganisms at the Old Rifle UMTRA Site|first1=Y|last1=Chang|year=2005|publisher=University of Tennessee|place=Knoxville}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Aside from bioreduction, biosorption, bioaccumulation and biomineralization, which are bacterial strategies for natural attenuation of radioactive contamination, there are also human methods that increase the efficiency or speed of microbial processes. This accelerated natural attenuation involves an intervention in the contaminated area to improve conversion rates of radioactive waste, which tend to be slow. There are two variants: biostimulation and bioaugmentation.&lt;ref name="nabir goals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.lbl.gov/NABIRarchive/researchprogram/strategicplan/goals.html|title=II. Program Goals and Management Strategy|format=Web|author=Natural and Accelerated Bioremediation Research|editor=[[United States Department of Energy]]|access-date=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biostimulation is the addition of nutrients with [[trace elements]], [[electron donors]] or [[electron acceptors]] to stimulate activity and growth of natural [[indigenous microbial]] communities.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nabir goals"/&gt; It can range from simple [[fertilization]] or infiltration (called passive biostimulation) to more aggressive injections to the ground, and is widely used at [[United States Department of Energy|US DOE]] sites.&lt;ref name="developments"/&gt; [[Nitrate]] is used as nutrient to biostimulate the reduction of [[uranium]], because it serves as very energetically favorable [[electron acceptor]] for [[Dissimilatory metal-reducing bacteria|metal-reducing bacteria]]. However, many of these microorganisms (''[[Geobacter]]'', ''[[Shewanella]]'' or ''[[Desulfovibrio]]'') exhibit [[R gene|resistance genes]] to [[heavy metals]] that limit their ability to bioremediate radionuclides. In these particular cases, a carbon source such as [[ethanol]] is added to the medium to promote the reduction of nitrate at first, and then of [[uranium]]. Ethanol is also used in soil injection systems with [[hydraulics|hydraulic]] [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|recirculations]]: it raises the [[pH]] and promotes the growth of [[denitrifying bacteria|denitrifying]] and radionuclide-reducing bacteria, that produce [[biofilms]] and achieve almost 90% decrease in the concentration of radioactive uranium.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;

A number of [[geophysics|geophysical]] techniques have been used to monitor the effects of in situ biostimulation trials including measurement of: [[spectral ionization potential]], [[self potential]]s, [[current density]], [[complex resistivity]] and also [[reactive transport modelling]] (RTM), which measures [[hydrogeology|hydrogeological]] and [[geochemistry|geochemical]] parameters to estimate chemical reactions of the microbial community.&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;

Bioaugmentaton, on the other hand, is the deliberated addition to the environment of microorganisms with desired traits to accelerate bacterial metabolic conversion of radioactive waste. They are often added when necessary species for bioremediation do not exist in the treatment place.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nabir goals"/&gt; This technique has shown in field trials over the years that it does not offer better results than biostimulation; neither it is clear that introduced species can be distributed effectively through the complex geological structures of most [[subsurface]] environments or that can compete long term with the indigenous microbiota.&lt;ref name="nabir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="developments"/&gt;

=== Genetic engineering and omics ===
[[File:Deinococcus radiodurans.jpg|thumb|130px|right|''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]'' has much interest in [[genetic engineering]] for bioremediation of radioactive waste.]]
{{main|Genetic engineering|Omics}}
Omics, especially genomics and proteomics, allow identifying and evaluating [[genes]], [[proteins]] and [[enzymes]] involved in radionuclide bioremediation, apart from the structural and functional interactions that exist between them and other metabolites. [[Genome sequencing]] of various microorganisms has uncovered, for example, that ''[[Geobacter sulfurreducens]]'' possess more than 100  [[coding region]]s for [[Cytochrome c|c-type cytochromes]] involved in bioremediation radionuclide, or that ''NiCoT'' gene is significantly overexpressed in ''[[Rhodopseudomonas palustris]]'' and ''[[Novosphingobium aromaticivorans]]'' when grown in medium with radioactive [[cobalt]].&lt;ref name="nabir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;

From this information, different genetic engineering and [[recombinant DNA]] techniques are being developed to generate specific bacteria for bioremediation. Some [[DNA construct|constructs]] expressed in microbial species are [[phytochelatins]], [[histidine|polyhistidines]] and other [[polypeptides]] by [[Fusion protein|fusion-binding domains]] to outer-membrane-anchored proteins.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt; Some of these genetically modified strains are derived from ''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]'', one of the most radiation-resistant organisms. ''D. radiodurans'' is capable to resist [[oxidative stress]] and [[DNA damage]] from radiation, and reduces [[technetium]], [[uranium]] and [[chromium]] naturally as well. Besides, through insertion of genes from other species it has been achieved that it can also precipitates [[uranyl phosphates]] and degrades [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] by using [[toluene]] as an energy source to grow and stabilize other priority radionuclides.&lt;ref name="nabir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;

[[Directed evolution]] of bacterial proteins related to bioremediation of radionuclides is also a field research. [[YieF]] enzyme, for example, naturally catalyzes the reduction of [[chromium]] with a very wide range of [[Substrate (biology)|substrates]]. Following [[protein engineering]], however, it has also been able to participate in [[uranyl ion]] reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=A.C|last1=Matin|title=Development of combinatorial bacteria for metal and radionuclide bioremediation|editor=Stanford University|publisher= DOE's Office of Scientific and Technical Information|year=2006|url=http://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/883649|format=PDF|place=Stanford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plant bioremediation ==
{{main|Phytoremediation}}

The use of plants to remove contaminants from the environment or to render them less harmful is called phytoremediation. In the case of radionuclides, it is a viable technology when decontamination times are long and waste are scattered at low concentrations.&lt;ref name="shaw"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Phytoremediation of soils contaminated with radionuclides|pages=43–69|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1569486006100030|title=Radioactivity in the Terrestrial Environment|editor1-first=G|editor1-last=Shaw|first1=N|last1=Willey|first2=C|last2=Collins|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080474892|volume=10|doi=10.1016/S1569-4860(06)10003-0|format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trends"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1022527207359|title=Trends in phytoremediation of radionuclides|year=2003|doi=10.1023/A:1022527207359|issn=1573-5036|first1=S|last1=Dushenkov|journal=Plant and Soil|volume=249|issue=1|pages=167–175|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|format=Web|place=Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some plant species are able to transform the state of radioisotopes (without suffering toxicity) concentrating them in different parts of their structure, making them rush through the roots, making them volatile or stabilizing them on the ground. As in bacteria, plant [[genetic engineering]] procedures and biostimulation —called [[phytostimulation]]— have improved and accelerate these processes, particularly with regard to [[fast-growing plants]].&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt; The use of ''[[Agrobacterium rhizogenes]]'', for example, is quite widespread and significantly increases radionuclide uptake by the [[Root|roots]].&lt;ref name="celso"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/genetic-transformation/transgenic-plants-for-enhanced-phytoremediation-physiological-studies|chapter=Chapter 16.

===Phytoextraction===
{{main|Phytoextraction}}
In phytoextraction (also phytoaccumulation, phytosequesteration or phytoabsorption)&lt;ref name="kumar"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=4. Phytoremediation techniques|pages=9–14|editor1-first=D|editor1-last=Kumar|editor2-first=C|editor2-last=Walther|place=Hannover|year=2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iz4qBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;dq=Kumar,+D;+Walther,+C.+«4.+Phytoremediation+techniques».+A:+Radionuclide+Contamination+and+Remediation+Through+Plants&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TqPstHR3aj&amp;sig=8gS3LIvI1gWC0l4fCOKEEoIW_qM&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHgMK9svLMAhVCahoKHRCYBywQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Kumar%2C%20D%3B%20Walther%2C%20C.%20«4.%20Phytoremediation%20techniques».%20A%3A%20Radionuclide%20Contamination%20and%20Remediation%20Through%20Plants&amp;f=false|title=Radionuclide Contamination and Remediation Through Plants|isbn=9783319076652|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; plants carry radioactive waste from the [[root system]] to the [[vascular tissue]] and become concentrated in the [[biomass]] of shoots. It is a technique that removes radionuclides without destroying the soil structure, with minimal impact on [[soil fertility]] and valid for large areas with a low level of radioactivity. Its efficiency is evaluated through [[bioaccumulation coefficient]] (BC) or total removal of radionuclides per [[square metre|m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]], and is proven to attract [[cesium-137]], [[strontium-90]], [[technetium-99]], [[cerium-144]], [[plutonium-240]], [[americium-241]], [[neptunium-237]] and various radioisotopes of [[thorium]] and [[radium]].&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt; By contrast, it requires large biomass production in short periods of time.&lt;ref name="celso"/&gt;

Species like [[common heather]] or [[amaranths]] are able to concentrate cesium-137, the most abundant radionuclide in the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]]. In this region of [[Ukraine]], [[mustard greens]] could remove up to 22% of average levels of cesium activity in a single growing season. In the same way, [[bok choy]] and mustard greens can concentrate 100 times more [[uranium]] than other species.&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt;

===Rhizofiltration===
[[File:Reedbeds - geograph.org.uk - 380204.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Connected pond system at [[River Dearne]] ([[England]]).]]
{{main|Rhizofiltration}}
Rhizofiltration is the adsorption and precipitation of radionuclides in plant roots or absorption thereof if soluble in effluents. It has great efficiency in the treatment of [[cesium-137]] and [[strontium-90]], particularly by [[algae]] and [[aquatic plants]], such as ''[[Cladophora]]'' and ''[[Elodea]]'' genera, respectively. It is the most efficient strategy for bioremediation technologies in [[wetlands]],&lt;ref name="kumar"/&gt; but must have a continuous and rigorous control of [[pH]] to make it an optimal process.&lt;ref name="celso"/&gt;

From this process, some strategies have been designed based on sequences of [[ponds]] with a slow [[Fluid dynamics|flow]] of water to clean polluted water with radionuclides. The results of these facilities, for flows of 1000 liters of effluent are about 95% retention of radiation in the first pond (by plants and [[sludge]]), and over 99% in three-base systems.&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt;

The most promising plants for rhizofiltration are [[sunflowers]]. They are able to remove up to 95% of [[uranium]] of contaminated water in 24 hours, and experiments in [[Chernobyl]] have demonstrated that they can concentrate on 55&amp;nbsp;kg of plant [[dry weight]] all the cesium and strontium radioactivity from an area of 75 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (stabilized material suitable for transfer to a nuclear waste repository).&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt;

===Phytovolatilization===
{{main|Phytovolatilization}}
Phytovolatilization involves the capture and subsequent [[transpiration]] of radionuclides into the [[atmosphere]]. It does not remove contaminants but releases them in volatile form (less harmful). Despite not having too many applications for radioactive waste, it is very useful for the treatment of [[tritium]], because it exploits plants' ability to transpire enormous amounts of water.&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kumar"/&gt;

The treatment applied to tritium (shielded by air produces almost no external radiation exposure, but its incorporation in water presents a health hazard when absorbed into the body) uses polluted effluents to [[irrigation|irrigate]] [[phreatophyte]]s. It becomes a system with a low operation cost and low maintenance, with savings of about 30% in comparison to conventional methods of [[pumping (oil well)|pumping]] and covering with [[asphalt]].&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt;

===Phytostabilization===
{{main|Phytostabilization}}
Phytostabilization is an specially valid strategy for radioactive contamination based on the immobilization of radionuclides in the soil by the action of the roots. This can occur by adsorption, absorption and precipitation within root zone, and ensures that radioactive waste can not be dispersed because [[soil erosion]] or [[Leaching (chemistry)|leaching]]. It is useful in controlling tailings from strip and open pit uranium mines, and guarantees to retrieve the [[ecosystem]].&lt;ref name="trends"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kumar"/&gt; However, it has significant drawbacks such as large doses of [[fertilizer]] needed to reforest the area, apart from radioactive source (which implies long-term maintenance) remaining at the same place.&lt;ref name="celso"/&gt;

== Fungal bioremediation ==
[[File:Chernobyl nuclear plant2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Radiotrophic fungi]] growth has been described in reactor 4 at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station]].]]
{{main|Mycoremediation}}
Several fungi species have radioactive resistance values equal to or greater than more radioresistant bacteria; they perform mycoremediation processes. It was reported that some fungi had the ability of growing into, feeding, generating [[spores]] and decomposing pieces of [[graphite]] from destroyed [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant sarcophagus|reactor No. 4]] at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station]], which is contaminated with high concentrations of [[cesium]], [[plutonium]] and [[cobalt]] radionuclides. They were called [[radiotrophic fungi]].&lt;ref name="casadevall"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2677413/pdf/nihms82938.pdf|first1=E|last1=Dadachova|first2=A|last2=Casadevall|title=Ionizing Radiation: how fungi cope, adapt, and exploit with the help of melanin|journal=Current Opinion in Microbiology|year=2008|volume=11|issue=6|pages=525–531|doi=10.1016/j.mib.2008.09.013|publisher=Elsevier|format=PDF|pmc=2677413|pmid=18848901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, it has been shown that some species of ''[[Penicillium]]'', ''[[Cladosporium]]'', ''[[Paecilomyces]]'' and ''[[Xerocomus]]'' are able to use [[ionizing radiation]] as energy through the electronic properties of [[melanins]].&lt;ref name="casadevall"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814601001716|title=A review of edible mushroom radioactivity|first1=P|last1=Kalac|journal=Food Chemistry|year=2001|volume=75|issue=1|pages=29–35|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/S0308-8146(01)00171-6|format=Web}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their feeding they bioaccumulate radioisotopes, creating problems on [[concrete]] walls of [[deep geological repository|deep geological repositories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=236–266|chapter=Fungal dissolution and transformation of minerals: significance for nutrient and metal mobility|first1=M|last1=Fomina|first2=E.P|last2=Burford|first3=G|last3=M.

== Ways of research ==
Current research on bioremediation techniques is fairly advanced and molecular mechanisms that govern them are well known. There are, however, many doubts about the effectiveness and possible adversities of these processes in combination with the addition of [[agrochemicals]]. In soils, the role of [[mycorrhizae]] on radioactive waste is poorly described and sequestration patterns of radionuclides are not known with certainty.&lt;ref name="pergamon"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Soil contamination with radionuclides and potential remediation|first1=Y.G|last1=Zhu|first2=G|last2=Shaw|journal=Chemosphere|publisher=Elsevier|volume=41|year=2000|issue=1-2|doi=10.1016/S0045-6535(99)00398-7|pmid=10819188|pages=121–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Longevity effects of some bacterial processes, such as maintenance of uranium in insoluble form because of bioreductions or biomineralizations, are unknown. There are not clear details about the [[electronic transfer]] from some radionuclides with these bacterial species either.&lt;ref name="newsome"/&gt;

Another important aspect is the change of ''[[ex situ]]'' or laboratory scale processes to their real application ''[[in situ]]'', in which soil heterogeneity and environmental conditions generate reproduction deficiencies of optimal biochemical status of the used species, a fact that decreases the efficiency. This implies finding what are the best conditions in which to carry out an efficient bioremediation with anions, metals, organic compounds or other chelating radionuclides that can compete with the uptake of interest radioactive waste.&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt; Nevertheless, in many cases research is focused on the extraction of soil and water and its ''ex situ'' biological treatment to avoid these problems.&lt;ref name="in situ"/&gt;

Finally, the potential of [[GMOs]] is limited by [[Regulation of the release of genetically modified organisms|regulatory agencies]] in terms of [[Social responsibility|responsibility]] and [[bioethics|bioethical]] issues. Their release require support on the action zone and comparability with indigenous species. Multidisciplinary research is focused on defining more precisely necessary [[genes]] and [[proteins]] to establish new [[free-cell]] systems, which may avoid possible side effects on the environment by the intrusion of [[transgenic]] or [[invasive species]].&lt;ref name="prakash"/&gt;

'''Body hair''', or '''androgenic hair''', is the [[terminal hair]] that develops on the [[human body]] during and after [[puberty]]. It is differentiated from the [[head hair]] and less visible [[vellus hair]], which are much finer and lighter in color. The growth of androgenic hair is related to the level of [[androgen]]s (often referred to as male [[hormone]]s) and the density of androgen receptors in the dermal papillae. Both must reach a threshold for the proliferation of hair follicle cells.

From childhood onward, regardless of [[sex]], vellus hair covers almost the entire area of the [[human body]]. Exceptions exclude the lips; the backs of the ears; the palms of hands; the soles of the feet; certain external [[Sex organ|genital]] areas; the [[navel]]; and [[scar]] tissue. The density of hair –&amp;nbsp;i.e. the number of [[hair follicle]]s per unit area of skin&amp;nbsp;– varies from person to person. In many cases, areas on the human body that contain vellus hair will begin to produce darker and thicker body hair, such as the first growth of [[Beard|beard hair]] on a male and female [[Adolescence|adolescent]]'s previously smooth chin; although it may appear thinner on the female.

Androgenic hair follows the same [[Human hair growth|growth pattern]] as the hair that grows on the scalp, but with a shorter [[Hair follicle#Anagen phase|anagen phase]] and longer [[Hair follicle#Telogen phase|telogen phase]].  While the anagen phase for the hair on one's head lasts for years, the androgenic hair growth phase for body hair lasts a few months. The telogen phase for body hair lasts close to a year.{{Citation needed|reason=Original source unavailabl or removed|date=May 2018}} This shortened growing period and extended dormant period explains why the hair on the head tends to be much longer than other hair found on the body.  Differences in length seen in comparing the hair on the back of the hand and pubic hair, for example, can be explained by varied growth cycles in those two regions.  The same goes for differences in body hair length seen in different people, especially when comparing [[men]] and [[women]].

==Distribution==
Like much of the hair on the human body, leg, arm, chest, and back hair begin as vellus hair.  As people age, the hair in these regions will often begin to grow darker and more abundantly.  This will typically happen during or after puberty.  Men will often have more abundant, coarser hair on the arms and back, while women tend to have a less drastic change in the hair growth in these areas but do experience a significant change in thickness of hairs.  However, some women will grow darker, longer hair in one or more of these regions.

=== Chest and abdomen ===
Vellus hair grows on the chest and abdomen of both sexes at all stages of development.  After puberty and extending into adulthood, most males grow increasing amounts of terminal hair over the chest and abdomen areas.  Adult women also typically can grow terminal hairs around the [[areola]] though in many cultures these hairs are typically removed.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
[[File:Arm hair.jpg|thumb|Arm hair]]

=== Arms ===
Arm hair grows on a human's [[forearms]], sometimes even on the elbow area. Terminal arm hair is concentrated on the wrist end of the forearm, extending over the [[hand]]. Terminal hair growth in adolescent males is often much more intense than that in females, particularly for individuals with dark hair. In some cultures, it is common for women to remove arm hair, though this practice is less frequent than that of leg hair removal.

Terminal hair growth on [[arm]]s is a secondary sexual characteristic in boys and appears in the last stages of puberty.  Vellus arm hair is usually concentrated on the elbow end of the forearm and often ends on the lower part of the [[upper arm]]. This type of intense arm vellus hair growth sometimes occurs in young women and people of both sexes until puberty. Even though this causes the arms to appear hairy, it is not caused solely by testosterone. The hair is softer and different from men's arm hair, in texture.

=== Feet ===
Visible hair appearing on the top surfaces of the feet and [[toes]] generally begins with the onset of puberty. Terminal hair growth on the feet is typically more intense in adult and adolescent males than in females.

=== Legs ===
[[File:Adolescent leg hair.jpg|thumb|Leg hair of an adolescent male]]
Leg hair sometimes appears at the onset of adulthood, with the legs of men more often hairier than those of women. For a variety of reasons, people may [[leg shaving|shave their leg hair]], including cultural practice or individual needs. Around the world, women generally shave their leg hair more regularly than men, to conform with the social norms of many cultures, many of which perceive smooth skin as a sign of youth, beauty, and in some cultures, hygiene. However, athletes of both sexes – [[Swimming (sport)|swimmers]], [[track and field|runners]], [[bicycling|cyclists]] and [[bodybuilding|bodybuilders]] in particular – may shave their androgenic hair to reduce friction, highlight muscular development or to make it easier to get into and out of skin-tight clothing.

===Pubic===
[[Pubic hair]] is a collection of coarse hair found in the pubic region. It will often also grow on the thighs and abdomen. Zoologist [[Desmond Morris]] disputes theories that it developed to signal sexual maturity or protect the skin from chafing during copulation, and prefers the explanation that pubic hair acts as a scent trap. Also, both sexes having thick pubic hairs act as a sort of cushion during intercourse.&lt;ref name="morris-bodywatching"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Desmond|title=Bodywatching: a field guide to the human species|year=1985|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[genital]] area of males and females are first inhabited by shorter, lighter vellus hairs that are next to invisible and only begin to develop into darker, thicker pubic hair at [[puberty]]. At this time, the [[pituitary gland]] secretes [[gonadotropin]] hormones which trigger the production of testosterone in the testicles and ovaries, promoting pubic hair growth. The average ages pubic hair begins to grow in males and females are 12 and 11, respectively. However, in some females, pubic hair has been known to start growing as early as age 7.

Just as individual people differ in scalp hair color, they can also differ in pubic hair color. Differences in thickness, growth rate, and length are also evident.

[[Islamic hygienical jurisprudence]] teaches that pubic and armpit hair must be pulled out or shaven to be considered as [[Sunnah]]. Trimming is acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=53EPNr8qeLgC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=Pubic+and+armpit+hair+must+also+be+shaven.+islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ4fuB-7fLAhVQUI4KHbjtBVMQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pubic%20and%20armpit%20hair%20must%20also%20be%20shaven.%20islam&amp;f=false | title=Living in the Shade of Islam: A Comprehensive Reference of Theory and Practice | publisher=Tughra Books | date=2003 | last=Ismail |first=Buyukcelebi | pages=169 | isbn=1-932-09921-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western culture, beginning in the 1980s, there has been a trend among women to remove or trim pubic hair, either partially or completely; the trend later spread to men as well. Fashions for both men and women to either shape or remove pubic hair rise and fall throughout much of history, though it is more often considered as a practice for women alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Looking Through the Bushes: The Disappearance of Pubic Hair|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/roger-friedland/women-pubic-hair_b_875465.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Roger|last=Friedland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armpits===

Underarm hair normally starts to appear at the [[pubarche|beginning]] of [[puberty]], with growth usually completed by the end of the teenage years.

Today in much of the world, it is common for women to regularly [[Shaving|shave]] their underarm hair. The prevalence of this practice varies widely, though. The practice became popular for cosmetic reasons around 1915 in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], when one or more magazines showed a woman in a dress with shaved underarms. As women's armpit hair contrasts more noticeably with her other body hair than does a man's, it is a significant indicator of sexual maturity and therefore unwelcome in conventional western polite society. Regular shaving became feasible with the introduction of the [[safety razor]] at the beginning of the 20th century. While underarm shaving was quickly adopted in some [[English language|English]] speaking countries, especially in the US and [[Canada]], it did not become widespread in [[Europe]] until well after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hope|first=Christine|year=1982|title=Caucasian Female Body Hair and American Culture|journal=Journal of American Culture|volume=5|issue=1|pages=93–99|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.1982.0501_93.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/625/who-decided-women-should-shave-their-legs-and-underarms |title=Who decided women should shave their legs and underarms? |last1=Adams |first1=Cecil |date=1991-02-06 |website=[[The Straight Dope]] |accessdate=2015-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the practice has spread worldwide. Some men also choose to shave their armpits.

===Facial===

[[Facial hair]], as the name suggests, grows primarily on or around one's [[face]]. Both men and women experience facial hair growth. Like pubic hair, non-vellus facial hair will begin to grow in around puberty. [[Moustache]]s in young men usually begin to grow in at around the age of puberty, although some men may not grow a moustache until they reach late teens or at all. For some cases facial hair development may take longer to mature than in the late teens but a lot of men experience no facial development even at an older age. Facial hair development has often been associated with stress levels.

It is common for many women to develop a few facial hairs under or around the chin, along the sides of the face (in the area of sideburns), or on the upper lip. These may appear at any age after puberty but are often seen in women after [[menopause]] due to decreased levels of estrogen. A darkening of the vellus hair of the upper lip in women is not considered true facial hair, though it is often referred to as a "moustache"; the appearance of these dark vellus hairs may be lessened by bleaching. A relatively small number of women are able to grow enough facial hair to have a distinct beard. In some cases, female beard growth is the result of a hormonal imbalance (usually [[androgen]] excess), or a rare genetic disorder known as [[hypertrichosis]].&lt;ref name="congenitallanuginosa"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1072987-overview |title= Congenital Hypertrichosis Lanuginosa|last1= Taylor|first1= Sarah K |date= June 18, 2009 |work= Emedicine|publisher= Medscape |accessdate=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it is caused by use of [[anabolic steroid]]s. Cultural pressure leads most women to remove facial hair, as it may be viewed as a [[social stigma]].

== Development==
{{Main|Human hair growth}}

Hair follicles are to varying degrees sensitive to androgen, primarily [[testosterone]] and its derivatives, particularly [[dihydrotestosterone]], with different areas on the body having different sensitivity. As androgen levels increase, the rate of hair growth and the weight of the hairs increase. Genetic factors determine both individual levels of androgen and the hair follicle's sensitivity to androgen, as well as other characteristics such as hair colour, type of hair and hair retention.

Rising levels of androgen during puberty cause vellus hair to transform into terminal hair over many areas of the body. The sequence of appearance of terminal hair reflects the level of androgen sensitivity, with [[pubic hair]] being the first to appear due to the area's special sensitivity to androgen. The appearance of pubic hair in both sexes is usually seen as an indication of the start of a person's puberty. There is a [[sexual differentiation]] in the amount and distribution of androgenic hair, with men tending to have more terminal hair in more areas. This includes [[facial hair]], [[chest hair]], [[abdominal hair]], [[leg hair]], [[arm hair]], and [[foot hair]]. Women retain more of the less visible vellus hair, although leg, arm, and foot hair can be noticeable on women.  It is not unusual for women to have a few terminal hairs around their nipples as well.
In the later decades of life, especially after the 5th decade, there begins a noticeable reduction in body hair especially in the legs.  The reason for this is not known but it could be due to poorer circulation, lower free circulating hormone amounts or other reasons.

==Function==

Androgenic hair provides tactile sensory input by transferring hair movement and vibration via the shaft to sensory nerves within the skin. Follicular nerves detect displacement of hair shafts and other nerve endings in the surrounding skin detect vibration and distortions of the skin around the follicles. Androgenic hair extends the sense of touch beyond the surface of the skin into the air and space surrounding it, detecting air movements as well as hair displacement from contact by insects or objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Controlled Stimulation of Hair Follicle Receptors |url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/36/2/256.pdf |author=N.

== Evolution ==
Determining the evolutionary function of androgenic hair must take into account both [[human evolution]] and the thermal properties of hair itself.

The thermodynamic properties of hair are based on the properties of the [[keratin]] strands and [[amino acids]] that combine into a 'coiled' structure. This structure lends to many of the properties of hair, such as its ability to stretch and return to its original length. This coiled structure does not predispose curly or frizzy hair, both of which are defined by oval or triangular hair follicle cross-sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hair-science.com/_int/_en/topic/topic_sousrub.aspx?tc=ROOT-HAIR-SCIENCE%5EAMAZINGLY-NATURAL%5ESHAPE-WORKSHOP&amp;cur=SHAPE-WORKSHOP |title=Hair Shape |publisher=Hair-science.com |date=1 February 2005 |accessdate=18 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222082300/http://www.hair-science.com/_int/_en/topic/topic_sousrub.aspx?tc=ROOT-HAIR-SCIENCE%5EAMAZINGLY-NATURAL%5ESHAPE-WORKSHOP&amp;cur=SHAPE-WORKSHOP |archivedate=22 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of less body hair===
Hair is a very good thermal conductor and aids heat transfer both into and out of the body. When [[goose bumps]] are observed, small muscles ([[Arrector pili muscle]]) contract to raise the hairs both to provide insulation, by reducing cooling by air convection of the skin, as well as in response to central nervous stimulus, similar to the feeling of 'hairs standing up on the back of your neck'. This phenomenon also occurs when static charge is built up and stored in the hair. Keratin however can easily be damaged by excessive heat and dryness, suggesting that extreme sun exposure, perhaps due to a lack of clothing, would result in perpetual hair destruction, eventually resulting in the genes being bred out in favor of high skin [[pigmentation]]. It is also true that parasites can live on and in hair thus peoples who preserved their body hair would have required greater general hygiene to prevent diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hair-science.com/_int/_en/topic/topic_sousrub.aspx?tc=ROOT-HAIR-SCIENCE^SO-STURDY-SO-FRAGILE^PROPERTIES-OF-HAIR^STRONG-HAIR&amp;cur=STRONG-HAIR |title=Properties Of Hair |publisher=Hair-science.com |date=1 February 2005 |accessdate=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Markus J. Rantala of the Department of Biological and Environmental Science, [[University of Jyväskylä]], [[Finland]], said humans evolved by "natural selection" to be hairless when the trade off of "having fewer parasites" became more important than having a "warming, furry coat".&lt;ref name="Rantala" /&gt;

P.E. Wheeler of the Department of Biology at [[Liverpool Polytechnic]] said [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] [[savannah]] [[mammal]]s of similar volume to humans have body hair to keep warm while only larger quadrupedal savannah mammals lack body hair, because their body volume itself is enough to keep them warm.&lt;ref name="Wheeler" /&gt; Therefore, Wheeler said humans who should have body hair based on predictions of body volume alone for savannah mammals evolved no body hair after evolving [[bipedalism]] which he said reduced the amount of body area exposed to the sun by 40%, reducing the solar warming effect on the human body.&lt;ref name="Wheeler"&gt;Wheeler, P.E. (1985). The Loss of Functional Body Hair in Man: the Influence of Thermal Environment, Body Form and Bipedality. Journal of Human Evolution. 14, 23–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss of fur occurred at least 2 million years ago, but possibly as early as 3.3 million years ago judging from the divergence of head and pubic lice, and aided [[persistence hunting]] (the ability to catch prey in very long distance chases) in the warm savannas where hominins first evolved.  The two main advantages are felt to be bipedal locomotion and greater thermal load dissipation capacity due to better sweating and less hair.&lt;ref&gt;Kittler R, Kayser M, Stoneking M: Molecular evolution of Pediculus humanus and the origin of clothing. Curr Biol. 2003, 13: 1414-1417. 10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00507-4. Erratum: Curr Biol 2004, 14:2309.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual selection===
{{Main|sexual selection}}

Markus J. Rantala of the Department of Biological and Environmental Science, [[University of Jyväskylä]], [[Finland]], said the existence of [[androgen]] dependent hair on men could be explained by [[sexual attraction]] whereby hair on the genitals would trap [[pheromones]] and hair on the chin would make the chin appear more massive.&lt;ref name="Rantala"&gt;Rantala, M.J.

In 1876,&lt;!--The book's date is 1876.--&gt; [[Oscar Peschel]] wrote that North Asiatic Mongols, Native Americans,&lt;!--Peschel used the ambiguous term "Americans" in his listing of peoples with little to no body hair, but Peschel's usage of the term "Americans" is in reference to Native Americans. Peschel's meaning of the term "Americans" is shown in a different part of the book from the context of the first sentence of the second paragraph of page 403 when Peschel said, "Those writers who separate the Americans as a peculiar race fail to give them distinctive characters, common to them all, which distinguish them from Asiatic Mongols."--&gt; Malays, Hottentots and Bushmen have little to no body hair,&lt;!--In the second sentence of the second paragraph of page 96, Peschel said, "Its scantiness or entire absence in North Asiatic Mongols, in American and Malay families, as well as in Hottentots and Bushmen, afford some of the most persistent and best authenticated racial characters, only it must be added that the natural baldness of the body is artificially exaggerated by the careful extraction of single hairs."--&gt; while Semitics, Indo-Europeans, and Southern Europeans (especially the Portuguese and Spanish) have extensive body hair.&lt;!--In the third and fourth sentences of the first paragraph of page 97, Peschel said, "A luxuriant growth of hair on the body is one of the distinctive marks of the Semitic as well as of the Indo-European families. In Southern Europeans, especially in Portuguese and Spaniards, this character is most strongly developed."--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peschel, O. (1876). The Races of Man and Their Geographical Distribution.

Eike-Meinrad Winkler and Kerrin Christiansen of the Institut für Humanbiologie, [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], did a study using [[Kavango people|Kavango]] people and [[!Kung]] people of body hair and hormone levels to investigate the reason [[black Africans]] did not have bodies as hairy as [[Europeans]].&lt;ref name="Winkler" /&gt; Winkler and Christiansen concluded the difference in hairiness between black Africans and Europeans had to do with differences in [[androgen]] or [[estradiol]] production, in androgen [[metabolism]], and in [[sex hormone]] action in the target cells.&lt;ref name="Winkler"&gt;Winkler, E.-M. and Christiansen, K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19818">'''Coitus reservatus''' (''[[Sexual intercourse|coitus]]'', "sexual intercourse, union" + ''reservatus'', "reserved, saved"),&lt;ref&gt;Cassell's ''Compact Latin Dictionary'', Dell Publishing Co. Inc., 1963&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''sexual continence''', is a form of sexual intercourse in which the penetrative partner does not attempt to [[Ejaculation|ejaculate]] within the receptive partner, but instead attempts to remain at the [[Human sexual response cycle#Plateau phase|plateau phase]] of intercourse for as long as possible avoiding the seminal emission.

[[Alice Stockham]] coined the term ''karezza'', derived from the Italian word "carezza" meaning "caress", to describe coitus reservatus, but the idea was already in practice at the [[Oneida Community]]. [[Alan Watts]] believed, in error, that karezza was a Persian word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watts |first=Alan W. |title=Nature, Man and Woman |page=172 |year=1970 |publisher=Random House Inc. Vintage Books Edition |lccn=58-8266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of karezza is loosely akin to [[maithuna]] in [[Tantra|Hindu Tantra]] and [[Sahaja]] in Hindu [[Yoga]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coomaraswami |first=Ananda K.|title=The Dance of Shiva |page=124 |publisher=The Noonday Press Inc. |year=1957 |location=New York City |lccn=56-12296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Control of ejaculation is a key aspect of [[Taoist sexual practices]] (known as "cai Yin pu Yang" and "cai Yang pu Yin").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/SEN/CH23.HTM|title=Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia: T|last=Pauly|first=Ira B.|date=2013-05-23|website=|publisher=Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523194332/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/SEN/CH23.HTM|archive-date=2013-05-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-06-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice of Karezza and Tantric (sexual) continence ==

Stockham writes, "... Karezza signifies 'to express affection in both words and action,' and while it fittingly denotes the union that is the outcome of deepest human affection, love's consummation, it is used technically throughout this work to designate a controlled sexual union." So that in practice, according to Stockham, it is more than just self-control, but mutual control where the penetrative partner helps the receptive partner and vice versa. According to Stockham this is the key to overcoming many difficulties encountered in trying to control sexual expression on an individual basis.{{sfn |Stockham |1896 |p=22}}
Stockham's contribution was to apply this same philosophy of [[Edging (sexual practice)|orgasm control]] to women as much as to men. A form of [[birth control]], the technique also prolongs sexual pleasure to the point of achieving mystical ecstasy, according to [[John William Lloyd|J. William Lloyd]], a practitioner of Karezza, whose own experience of [[cosmic consciousness]] appears in  ''Cosmic Consciousness'', a book written  by the Canadian psychiatrist [[Richard Maurice Bucke|Richard M. Bucke]], a friend of the American poet [[Walt Whitman]].&lt;ref&gt;Bucke, Richard Maurice, M. D. ''Cosmic Consciousness'', p. 284, Citadel Press, 1961, {{ISBN|0-8065-0211-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this practice,  orgasm is separated from ejaculation, making possible enjoyment of the pleasure of sexual intercourse without experiencing seminal ejaculation, while still experiencing orgasm.

Some would have the principles of karezza applied to masturbation, whereby a person attempts to delay orgasm as long as possible to prolong pleasure in a process known as "orgasmic brinkmanship", "surfing", or "edging" but this is different from the heterosexual practice of "karezza".&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Marie Griffith ''Born Again Bodies'', p. 92, [[University of California Press]], 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-520-24240-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Latin literature, this is known as ''coitus sine ejaculatione seminis''.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, J. William ''The Karezza Method'' Health Research, 1964, Mokelumne Hill, California&lt;/ref&gt;

One purpose of karezza is the maintenance, and indeed, intensification of desire and enjoyment of sexual pleasure within the context of  relationships. According to Stockham, it takes from two weeks to a month for the body to recover from ejaculation ... "Unless procreation is desired, let the final propagative orgasm be entirely avoided".{{sfn |Stockham |1896 |p=25}} Stockham advocated that the 'honeymoon period' of a relationship could be maintained in perpetuity by limiting the frequency of ejaculations or preferably avoiding them entirely.{{sfn |Stockham |1896 |p=15}}

Kalman Andras Oszlar writes, "Inasmuch as sexual togetherness is not limited into the physical world and does not mean quick wasting of sexual energies, by this we give free way to higher dimensions in the relationship." Affected by this we may be gotten into the state of flow experience (abbreviated as flow) and in the course of this the couple charges up with energy, while – with focused attention (Dharana) – the couple is submerging in which they are having pleasure. This state of mind is connected with the achieved beneficial effects by tantric restraint and transformation. At first the definition of positive philosophy was defined by [[Mihály Csíkszentmihályi]] and since then it is referred beyond the professional line. According to the professor the flow-experience is an entirely focused and a motivationally intensified experience where in the course of this people can entirely focus and properly command their feelings for the best performance or learning.

===General===
There is a slight difference between karezza and coitus reservatus.  In coitus reservatus, unlike karezza, a woman can enjoy a prolonged orgasm while a man exercises self-control; similarly, in the context of two male sexual partners, the receptive partner can enjoy the stimulation of his prostate for a longer period of time than he would otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Rudolf Von Urban, M. D. ''Sex Perfection and Marital Happiness'', Dial Press, 1949  ISBN B001AA3TWA&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[coitus interruptus]], coitus reservatus is not a reliable form of preventing a [[sexually transmitted disease]], as the penis leaks [[pre-ejaculate]] prior to ejaculation, which may contain all of the same infectious viral particles and bacteria as the actual [[semen]]. Although studies have not found sperm in pre-ejaculate fluid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; the method is also unreliable for [[contraception]] because of the difficulty of controlling ejaculation beyond the point of no return in over-reaching the orgasm. Additionally, if it follows an earlier orgasm, it is possible for pre-ejaculate fluid to pick up sperm from a previous ejaculation, leading to pregnancy even when performed correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Withdrawal Method |work=Planned Parenthood |date=March 2004 | url =http://www.plannedparenthood.com/health-topics/birth-control/withdrawal-pull-out-method-4218.htm |accessdate=2008-03-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on ''coitus reservatus''===
The [[Oneida Community]], founded in the 19th century by [[John Humphrey Noyes]], experimented with coitus reservatus which was then called '''male continence''' in a religiously [[Christian]] [[communalism|communalist]] environment. The experiment lasted for about a quarter of a century and then Noyes went on to create Oneida silverware and establish the Oneida Silver Co. that grew into [[Oneida Limited]].{{sfn |Ellis |1910 |p=553}}  Noyes identified three functions of the sexual organs: the urinary, the propagative and the amative. Noyes believed in the separation of the amative from the propagative, and he put amative sexual intercourse on the same footing with other ordinary forms of social interchange. Sexual intercourse as Noyes defines it is the insertion of the penis into the vagina; ejaculation is not a requirement for sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Noyes 1872"&gt;{{cite book |title=Male continence |website=Syracuse University Library - Department of Special Collections - Oneida Community Collection |authorlink=John Humphrey Noyes |first=John Humphrey |last=Noyes |archiveurl=https://iiif.lib.harvard.edu/manifests/view/drs:2577486$1i |archivedate=2017-11-03 |deadurl=no |year=1877 |orig-year=1872 |location=Oneida, NY |publisher=Office of the American Socialist |oclc=786280936 |url=https://library.syr.edu/digital/collections/m/MaleContinence-51k/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English novelist [[Aldous Huxley]], in his last novel ''Island'' wrote that Maithuna, the Yoga of Love is... "the same as what [[Roman Catholicism]] means by ''coitus reservatus''."&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous ''Island, Harper &amp; Row, 1962''&lt;/ref&gt; Getting to the point by discussing ''coitus reservatus'', Alan W. Watts in ''Nature, Man and Woman'' notes: "...I would like to see someone make a case for the idea that the [[Apostles]] really did hand down an inner tradition to the Church, and that through all these centuries the Church has managed to guard it from the public eye. If so, it has remained far more secret and [[esotericism|"esoteric"]] than in any of the other great spiritual traditions of the world, so much so that its existence is highly doubtful..."&lt;ref&gt;"Watts, Alan W. ''Nature, Man and Woman, Ch 7, Pantheon Books Inc. 1958''&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh writer [[Norman Lewis (author)|Norman Lewis]], in his celebrated account of life in [[Naples]] in 1944, claimed that [[Saint Roch|San Rocco]] was the [[patron saint]] of coitus reservatus:  "I recommended him to drink -- as the locals did -- [[Marsala wine|marsala]] with the yolk of eggs stirred into it, and to wear a medal of San Rocco, patron of coitus reservatus, which could be had in any religious-supplies shop".&lt;ref name="Lewis 2005 p. "&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Norman |title=Naples '44 : a World War II diary of occupied Italy |publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf |publication-place=New York |year=2005 |isbn=9781480433250 |oclc=854852494 |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/naples-44-a-world-war-ii-diary-of-occupied-italy/oclc/854852494/viewport}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coitus reservatus is said by some authors to be a part of the teachings of the Catholic Church regarding sexual intercourse and to be a permitted form of intercourse but was subject to the same arguments as coitus interruptus.&lt;ref name="Bullough 2001 p. "&gt;{{cite book |last=Bullough |first=Vern |title=Encyclopedia of birth control |publisher=ABC-CLIO |publication-place=Santa Barbara, Calif |year=2001 |isbn=9781576075333 |page= |oclc=50174689}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]], the Catholic Church condemned this practice, under the Latin term "amplexus reservatus" (reserved embrace).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Denzinger |first=Heinrich|title=Enchiridion Symbolorum |publisher=Ignatius Press |publication-place=San Francisco, Calif |year=2012 |isbn=9780898707465 |page=810 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist [[Havelock Ellis]] writes: "''Coitus Reservatus'', – in which intercourse is maintained even for very long periods, during which a woman may have orgasm several times while the penetrative partner succeeds in holding back orgasm, – so far from being injurious to a woman, is probably the form of coitus which gives her the maximum gratification and relief".{{sfn |Ellis |1910 |p=552}}

== Rosicrucians ==
The [[AMORC]] [[Rosicrucians]] declare openly that they do not engage in sexual practices of an occult nature. This has been so since their First Imperator [[H. Spencer Lewis]], Ph. D. made it public knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, H. Spencer ''Rosicrucian Manual'', p. 5, Supreme Grand Lodge of AMORC, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Their rival organization [[Fraternitas Rosae Crucis]] led by Dr. [[R. Swinburne Clymer]] engages in sexual practices for the sake of race regeneration. Dr. Clymer is completely opposed to the practice of Karezza or ''coitus reservatus'' and advocates instead a form of sex intercourse in which the couple experiences the orgasm at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, R. Swinburne MD, ''The Mystery of Sex and Race Regeneration'', p. 223, The Philosophical Publishing Co., 1950&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretary of the [[FUDOSI]] instead heartily approves the practice of Karezza to establish harmony in the family as well as in the world by preventing the waste and misuse of sex energy.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Lanval, editor, ''Lumière et Liberté'', Organe Officiel de la Ligue Belge de Propagande Héliophile, Octobre-Novembre 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Arnold Krumm-Heller]] established the [[Fraternitas Rosicruciana Antiqua]] (FRA), a Rosicrucian school in Germany with branches in South America, having the following formula of sexual conduct: "Immissio Membri Virile In Vaginae Sine Ejaculatio Seminis" (Introduce the penis in the vagina without ejaculating the semen). [[Samael Aun Weor]] experimented with that formula and developed the doctrine of ''[[The Perfect Matrimony]]''.

== "Dianism" in Sex Magick == 
{{main|Dianism}}
Inspired by [[Ida Craddock]]'s work Heavenly Bridegrooms, American occultist [[C.F. Russell]] developed his own curriculum of [[sex magick]].&lt;ref name="google.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yFs3qoTFVz8C&amp;pg=PA12|title=The Complete Magick Curriculum of the Secret Order G.B.G.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1960s, disciple Louis T.

== Controversy ==

[[Alice Bunker Stockham|Alice Stockham]] was taken to court and forced to give up teaching the practice of Karezza in the [[United States]]. Like many other sex reformers, Dr. Stockham was arrested by [[Anthony Comstock]].&lt;ref&gt;John P. Deveney ''Paschal B. Randolph'', p. 393, SUNY Press, 1997 {{ISBN|978-0-7914-3119-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He jailed for long terms a variety of spiritual marriage reformers including [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]] who had been a personal friend of [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref&gt;Paschal B. Randolph ''Ravalette: The Rosicrucian's Story'', p. 64, Kessinger Publishing, 2005 {{ISBN|978-0-7661-9160-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ida Craddock]] committed [[suicide in the United States|suicide]] after being repeatedly jailed for peddling [[pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;Vern L. Bullough ''Encyclopedia of Birth Control'', pp. 76-9, ABC-CLIO, 2001 {{ISBN|978-1-57607-181-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Oneida Community]] was attacked in the press and Noyes was forced to flee to [[Canada]] due to a warrant being issued for his arrest on a [[statutory rape]] charge on June 22, 1879. From there, he advised others to follow [[St. Paul]]'s plan of either [[marriage]] or [[celibacy]], and to obey the [[Ten Commandments|commandments]] against [[adultery]] and [[fornication]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Gutek ''Visiting Utopian Communities'', p. 137, [[University of South Carolina Press]], 1998 {{ISBN|978-1-57003-210-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kepler-Bruno.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Figure 'M' (for Latin ''Mundus'') from [[Johannes Kepler]]'s 1617–1621 ''[[Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae]]'', showing the [[Earth]] as belonging to just one of any number of similar stars.]]
In [[physical cosmology]], the '''Copernican principle''' is an alternative name for the  [[principle of relativity]], stating that humans, on the [[Earth]] or in the [[Solar system]], are not privileged observers of the [[universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Peacock |first=John A. | title =  Cosmological Physics | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | page = 66 | year = 1998 |isbn= 0-521-42270-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Named for [[Copernican heliocentrism]], it is a working assumption that arises from a modified cosmological extension of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus's]] argument of a moving Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bondi |first=Hermann| authorlink = Hermann Bondi | title = Cosmology | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1952 | pages = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some sense, it is equivalent to the [[mediocrity principle]].

== Origin and implications ==

[[Hermann Bondi]] named the principle after Copernicus in the mid-20th century, although the principle itself dates back to the 16th-17th century [[paradigm shift]] away from the [[Ptolemaic system]], which placed [[Earth]] at the center of the [[universe]]. Copernicus proposed that the motion of the planets can be explained by reference to an assumption that the Sun and not Earth is centrally located and stationary. He argued that the [[apparent retrograde motion]] of the planets is an illusion caused by Earth's movement around the [[Sun]], which the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican model]] placed at the centre of the universe. Copernicus himself was mainly motivated by technical dissatisfaction with the earlier system and not by support for any mediocrity principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhn |first= Thomas S. | authorlink = Thomas Kuhn | title = The Copernican Revolution: Planetary Astronomy in the Development of Western Thought | publisher = [[Harvard University Press]] |year=1957 | isbn=978-0-674-17103-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, although the Copernican heliocentric model is often described as "demoting" Earth from its central role it had in the Ptolemaic geocentric model, it was successors to Copernicus, notably the 16th century [[Giordano Bruno]] who adopted this new perspective. The earth's central position had been interpreted as being in the "lowest and filthiest parts". Instead, as Galileo said, the earth is part of the "dance of the stars" rather than the "sump where the universe's filth and ephemera collect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1038/scientificamerican0301-24a |journal= Scientific American |year=2001 |volume=284 |issue=3 |pages=24 |title= Copernican Counterrevolution |authorlink= George Musser |last=Musser |first=George  |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=in-brief-2001-03|bibcode = 2001SciAm.284c..24M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1511/2009.76.50 |journal= American Scientist |year=2009 |volume=97 |issue=1 |pages=50–57 |title= The Bones of Copernicus |first= Dennis |last=Danielson }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the late 20th Century, Carl Sagan asked, "Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which there are far more galaxies than people."&lt;ref&gt;Sagan C, Cosmos (1980) p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

In cosmology, if one assumes the Copernican principle and observes that the universe appears [[Isotropy|isotropic]] or the same in all directions from our vantage point on Earth, then one can infer that the universe is generally [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] or the same everywhere (at any given time) and is also isotropic about any given point. These two conditions make up the [[cosmological principle]].&lt;ref name="RowanRobinson1996" /&gt; In practice, astronomers observe that the universe has [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] or non-uniform structures up to the scale of [[galactic supercluster]]s, [[Galaxy filament|filaments]] and [[Void (astronomy)|great void]]s. It becomes more and more homogeneous and isotropic when observed on larger and larger scales, with little detectable structure on scales of more than about 200 million [[parsec]]s. However, on scales comparable to the radius of the observable universe, we see systematic changes with distance from Earth. For instance, galaxies contain more young stars and are less clustered, and [[quasars]] appear more numerous. While this might suggest that Earth is at the center of the universe, the Copernican principle requires us to interpret it as evidence for the evolution of the universe with time: this distant light has taken most of the age of the universe to reach us and show us the universe when it was young. The most distant light of all, [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], is isotropic to at least one part in a thousand.

Modern mathematical cosmology is based on the assumption that the Cosmological principle is almost, but not exactly, true on the largest scales. The Copernican principle represents the irreducible philosophical assumption needed to justify this, when combined with the observations.

[[Michael Rowan-Robinson]] emphasizes the Copernican principle as the threshold test for modern thought, asserting that: "It is evident that in the post-Copernican era of human history, no well-informed and rational person can imagine that the Earth occupies a unique position in the universe."&lt;ref name="RowanRobinson1996"&gt;{{cite book | last=Rowan-Robinson |first=Michael  |authorlink=Michael Rowan-Robinson | title = Cosmology| edition = 3rd | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | pages = 62–63  |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-19-851884-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bondi and [[Thomas Gold]] used the Copernican principle to argue for the [[perfect cosmological principle]] which maintains that the universe is also homogeneous in time, and is the basis for the [[steady-state cosmology]].&lt;ref name="BondiGold1948"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bondi|first=H.|author2=Gold, T.|title=The Steady-State Theory of the Expanding Universe|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|year=1948|volume=108|issue=3|pages=252–270|bibcode=1948MNRAS.108..252B|doi=10.1093/mnras/108.3.252}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this strongly conflicts with the evidence for cosmological evolution mentioned earlier:  the universe has progressed from extremely different conditions at the [[Big Bang]], and will continue to progress toward extremely different conditions, particularly under the rising influence of [[dark energy]], apparently toward the [[Big Freeze]] or [[Big Rip]].

Since the 1990s the term has been used (interchangeably with "the Copernicus method") for [[J. Richard Gott]]'s [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian-inference]]-based prediction of duration of ongoing events, a generalized version of the [[Doomsday argument]].{{clarify|date=April 2017}}

==Tests of the principle==
The Copernican principle has never been proven, and in the most general sense cannot be proven, but it is implicit in many modern theories of physics.  Cosmological models are often derived with reference to the [[Cosmological principle]], slightly more general than the Copernican principle, and many tests of these models can be considered tests of the Copernican principle.&lt;ref name=clarkson&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clarkson | first1 = C. | last2 = Bassett | first2 = B. | last3 = Lu | first3 = T. | title = A General Test of the Copernican Principle | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.011301 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 101 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0712.3457 |bibcode = 2008PhRvL.101a1301C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical===
Before the term Copernican principle was even coined, Earth was repeatedly shown not to have any special location in the universe. The [[Copernican Revolution]] dethroned Earth to just one of many planets orbiting the Sun. [[Proper motion]] was mentioned by Halley. [[William Herschel]] found that the Solar System is moving through space within our disk-shaped [[Milky Way]] galaxy. [[Edwin Hubble]] showed that our galaxy is just one of many galaxies in the universe. Examination of our galaxy's position and motion in the universe led to the [[Big Bang|Big Bang theory]] and the whole of modern [[cosmology]].

==Physics without the principle==
The standard model of cosmology, the [[Lambda-CDM model]], assumes the Copernican principle and the more general [[Cosmological principle]] and observations are largely consistent but there are always [[Unsolved problems in physics#Astronomy and astrophysics|unsolved problems]].  Some cosmologists and theoretical physicists design models lacking the Cosmological or Copernican principles, to constrain the valid values of observational results, to address specific known issues, and to propose tests to distinguish between current models and other possible models.

A prominent example in this context is the observed [[accelerating universe]] and the [[cosmological constant]] issue.  An alternative proposal to [[dark energy]] is that the universe is much more inhomogeneous than currently assumed, and specifically that we are in an extremely large low-density void.&lt;ref name=void&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = February | first1 = S. | last2 = Larena | first2 = J. | last3 = Smith | first3 = M. | last4 = Clarkson | first4 = C. | title = Rendering dark energy void | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2966.2010.16627.x | journal = Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society | pages = no | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0909.1479 |bibcode = 2010MNRAS.405.2231F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  To match observations we would have to be very close to the centre of this void, immediately contradicting the Copernican principle.

'''''De pictura''''' (English: "On Painting") is a treatise written by the Italian architect and art theorist [[Leon Battista Alberti]]. The first version, written in vernacular Italian in 1435 under the title '''''Della pittura''''', was for a general audience. The Latin version, the ''De pictura'' of 1439–41, was more technical and intended for scholars.&lt;ref name="StAndrews"&gt;{{cite web |last1=O'Connor |first1=J. J. |last2=Robertson |first2=E. F. |title=Mathematics and art - perspective |url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Art.html |publisher=University of St Andrews |accessdate=21 October 2016 |date=January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is the first in a trilogy of treatises on the "Major arts" which had a widespread circulation during the [[Renaissance]], the others being ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'' ("On Architecture", 1454) and ''De statua'' ("On Sculpture", 1462).

==Context==

Alberti was a member of [[history of Florence|Florentine]] family exiled in the 14th century, who was able to return in Florence only from 1434, in the following of the Papal court during the [[Council of Florence]]. Here he knew contemporary art innovators such as  [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Donatello]] and [[Masaccio]], with whom he shared an interest for [[Renaissance humanism]] and classical art. Alberti was the first post-classical writer to produce a work of [[art theory]], as opposed to works about the function of religious art or art techniques, and reflected the developing [[Italian Renaissance art]] of his day.

===Approach===
{{further information|Mathematics and art}}

''De pictura'' aimed to describe systematically the figurative arts through "geometry". Alberti divided painting into three parts:
*''Circumscriptio'' (Italian: ''disegno''), consisting in drawing the bodies' contour
*'' Compositio'' (''commensuratio'' in the Italian version of the treatise), including tracing the lines joining the bodies
* ''Receptio luminum'' (''color''), taking into consideration colors and light.

The treatise contained an analysis of all the techniques and painting theories known at the time, in this surpassing medieval works such as ''The book of Art'' by [[Cennino Cennini]] (1390). ''De pictura'' also includes the first description of linear geometric perspective around 1416; Alberti credited the discovery to [[Brunelleschi]], and dedicated the 1435 edition to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Edgerton|first1=Samuel Y.|title=Brunelleschi's mirror, Alberti's window, and Galileo's 'perspective tube'|journal=História, Ciências, Saúde-Manguinhos|date=October 2006|volume=13|issue=suppl. 0|doi=10.1590/S0104-59702006000500010|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0104-59702006000500010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberti argued that multi-figure history painting was the noblest form of art, as being the most difficult, which required mastery of all the others, because it was a visual form of history, and because it had the greatest potential to move the viewer. He placed emphasis on the ability to depict the interactions between the figures by gesture and expression.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Blunt|Blunt, Anthony]], ''Artistic Theory in Italy, 1450-1660'', (1985) [1940] [[OUP]], {{ISBN|0-19-881050-4}}, pages 11–12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barlow, Paul, [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:9MoshlkHpFYJ:www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/uploads/docs/s1_23.pdf+Paul+Barlow+Professor&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjcjev4zZWsyXRk2Qb0TAbQHs52uwq7cmMmRBnlY97ah2aGpKYtVsGu-QOIeMciCrUfH45N1knB0NFikusclJybCwP5TMoAMaQJNS8TPzZFOBvOQvtUrmEPUT--Kqw8tmhvKr8G&amp;sig=AHIEtbSRK7DWVGwdLbYF38jvUAihfTFS0Q "The Death of History Painting in Nineteenth-Century Art?" PDF], ''Visual Culture in Britain'', Volume 6, Number 1, Summer 2005, pages 1–13&lt;/ref&gt;

''De pictura'' relied heavily on references to art in classical literature; in fact [[Giotto]]'s huge ''[[Navicella (mosaic)|Navicella]]'' in mosaic at [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome (now effectively lost) was the only{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} modern (post-classical) work described in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Svetlana Alpers |author=Alpers, Svetlana Leontief |title=Ekphrasis and Aesthetic Attitudes in Vasari's Lives |journal=Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes |volume=23 |issue=3/4 |date=July 1960 |pages=190–192 |jstor=750591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
 [[File:Leonardo Da Vinci - Annunciazione.jpeg|thumb|350px|The accurate perspective in [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s paintings such as his ''[[Annunciation (Leonardo)|Annunciation]]'' (1475–1480) derives from Alberti's ''De pictura''.]]

''De pictura'' influenced the work of artists including [[Donatello]], [[Ghiberti]], [[Botticelli]], and [[Ghirlandaio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lefaivre, Liane  |title=Leon Battista Alberti's Hypnerotomachia Poliphili: Re-Cognizing the Architectural Body in the Early Italian Renaissance |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ocUH6f3l_E8C&amp;pg=PA135 |year=2005 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-62195-3 |pages=135–}}&lt;/ref&gt; His treatment of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] was the most influential of his recommendations, having a powerful effect on [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and through him on the whole Italian renaissance.&lt;ref name=Ackerman&gt;{{cite book |last=Ackerman |first=James S. |title=Distance Points: Essays in Theory and Renaissance Art and Architecture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W7EadYT-LTUC&amp;pg=PA87 |year=1994 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-51077-6 |pages=86–87 |quote=No particular precept in the first part of De pictura had as pervasive an impact as the following section on perspective construction; the specific recommendations on color and shadow were ineffectual.. But the incalculable change that Leonardo wrought was directly dependent on Alberti's vision of art as a branch .. of optics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alberti made at least 29 uses of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'', deriving his key themes of simplicity and seriousness directly from Pliny. For example, Alberti advised artists to use colour with restraint, and to paint in the effect of gold rather than using actual gold in their paintings. Gold did indeed vanish from Italian paintings of the second part of the 15th century. Artists however found their own ways to paint with restraint, rather than following Alberti's actual instructions directly. Similarly, he encouraged artists to add black when modelling shapes, rather than only adding white as [[Cennino Cennini]] had advised in his c.&amp;nbsp;1390 ''Il Libro dell'Arte''. This advice had the effect of making Italian renaissance paintings more sombre. Alberti was here perhaps following Pliny's description of the dark varnish used by Apelles.&lt;ref name=Ackerman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Grafton |first1=Anthony |last2=Most |first2=Glenn W. |last3=Settis |first3=Salvatore |title=The Classical Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbqF8z2bq3sC&amp;pg=PA214 |year=2010 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03572-0|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2''' ('''eIF2''') is a [[eukaryotic initiation factor]]. It is required for most forms of eukaryotic [[Translation (biology)|translation]] initiation. eIF2 mediates the binding of [[tRNA]]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Met&lt;/sup&gt; to the ribosome in a [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]]-dependent manner. eIF2 is a heterotrimer consisting of an [[EIF2S1|alpha]] (also called subunit 1), a [[EIF2S2|beta]] (subunit 2), and a [[EIF2S3|gamma]] (subunit 3) subunit.

Once the initiation phase has completed, eIF2 is released from the ribosome bound to [[Guanosine diphosphate|GDP]] as an inactive binary complex. To participate in another round of translation initiation, this GDP must be exchanged for GTP.

==Function==
[[Image:Eukaryotic initiation.png |thumb|right |400px |The process of initiation of translation in eukaryotes with eIF2 in light-green. Other factors are shown, too.]]
eIF2 is an essential factor for protein synthesis that forms a ternary complex (TC) with [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] and the initiator [[Methionine|Met]]-[[tRNA]]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Met&lt;/sup&gt;. After its formation, the TC binds the [[Eukaryotic small ribosomal subunit (40S)|40S ribosomal subunit]] to form the [[43S preinitiation complex]] (43S PIC). 43S PIC assembly is believed to be stimulated by the [[Eukaryotic initiation factor|initiation factors]] [[eIF1]], [[eIF1AX|eIF1A]], and the [[eIF3]] complex according to ''in vitro'' experiments. The 43S PIC then binds [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] that has previously been unwound by the [[eIF4F]] complex. The 43S PIC and the eIF4F proteins form a new 48S complex on the mRNA, which starts searching along the mRNA for the [[start codon]] (AUG). Upon base pairing of the AUG-codon with the Met-tRNA, [[eIF5]] (which is a [[GTPase-activating protein]]) is recruited to the complex and induces eIF2 to hydrolyse its GTP. This causes eIF2-GDP to be released from this 48S complex and translation begins after recruitment of the [[60S]] ribosomal sub-unit and formation of the [[80S]] initiation complex. Finally, with the help of the [[Guanine nucleotide exchange factor]] [[eIF2B]],&lt;ref&gt;eIF2B consists of the sub-units [[EIF2B1]], [[EIF2B2]], [[EIF2B3]], [[EIF2B4]], [[EIF2B5]]&lt;/ref&gt; the GDP in eIF2 is exchanged for a GTP and the ternary complex reforms for a new round of translation initiation.

==Structure==
eIF2 is a heterotrimer of a total molar mass of 126 [[Dalton (unit)|kDa]] that is composed of the three sub-units: [[EIF2S1|α]] (sub-unit 1), [[EIF2S2|β]] (sub-unit 2), and [[EIF2S3|γ]] (sub-unit 3). 
The sequences of all three sub-units are highly conserved (pairwise amino acid identities for each sub-unit range from 47–72% when comparing the proteins of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' and ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'').

The '''α-subunit''' contains the main target for [[phosphorylation]], a [[serine]] at position 51. It also contains a S1 motif domain, which is a potential RNA binding-site. Therefore, the α-subunit can be considered the regulatory subunit of the trimer.

The '''β-subunit''' contains multiple phosphorylation sites (residues 2, 13, 67, 218). What is important to consider is that there are also three [[lysine]] clusters in the N-terminal domain (NTD), which are important for the interaction with eIF2B. Moreover, the sequence of the protein comprises a [[zinc-finger|zinc finger motif]] that was shown to play a role in both ternary complex and 43S preinitiation complex formation. There are also two guanine nucleotide-binding sequences that have not been shown to be involved in the regulation of eIF2 activity. The β-subunit is also believed to interact with both tRNA and mRNA.

The '''γ-sub-unit''' comprises three guanine nucleotide-binding sites and is known to be the main docking site for GTP/GDP. It also contains a tRNA-binding cavity that has been shown by [[X-ray crystallography]]. A zinc knuckle motif is able to bind one Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cation.&lt;ref name="pmid16153175"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid14688270"&gt;

eIF2 activity is regulated by a mechanism involving both guanine nucleotide exchange and [[phosphorylation]]. Phosphorylation takes place at the α-subunit, which is a target for a number of [[Serine/threonine-specific protein kinase|serine kinases]] that phosphorylate [[serine]] 51. Those kinases act as a result of stress such as amino acid deprivation ([[EIF2AK4|GCN2]]), ER stress ([[EIF2AK3|PERK]]), the presence of dsRNA ([[Protein kinase R|PKR]]) heme deficiency ([[Heme-regulated inhibitor kinase|HRI]]), or [[interferon]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once phosphorylated, eIF2 shows increased affinity for its [[Guanine nucleotide exchange factor]] eIF2B. However, eIF2B is able to exchange GDP for GTP only if eIF2 is in its unphosphorylated state. Phosphorylated eIF2, however, due to its stronger binding, acts as an inhibitor of its own GEF (eIF2B). Since the cellular concentration of eIF2B is much lower than that of eIF2, even a small amount of phosphorylated eIF2 can completely abolish eIF2B activity by sequestration. Without the GEF, eIF2 can no longer be returned to its active (GTP-bound) state. As a consequence, translation comes to a halt since initiation is no longer possible without any available ternary complex. Furthermore, low concentration of ternary complex allows the expression of GCN4 (starved condition), which, in turn, results in increased activation of amino acid synthesis genes&lt;ref name="pmid10216940"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid2687263"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16153175"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid11042214"/&gt;&lt;ref name="test"&gt;

==Disease==
Since eIF2 is essential for most forms of translation initiation and therefore protein synthesis, defects in eIF2 are often lethal. The protein is highly conserved among evolutionary remote species - indicating a large impact of mutations on cell viability. Therefore, no diseases directly related to mutations in eIF2 can be observed. However, there are many illnesses caused by down-regulation of eIF2 through its upstream kinases. For example, increased concentrations of active PKR and inactive (phosphorylated) eIF2 were found in patients suffering from neurodegenerative diseases such as [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]], [[Parkinson's disease|Parkinson’s]], and [[Huntington's disease|Huntington’s]] disease. There is also one proven example of a disease related to the GEF eIF2B. Mutations in all of the five subunits of eIF2B could be linked with [[leukoencephalopathy with vanishing white matter|leukoencephalopathy]], an illness that causes the brain’s white matter to disappear. It is still not fully understood why only brain cells seem to be affected by these defects. Potentially reduced levels of unstable regulatory proteins might play a role in the development of the diseases mentioned.&lt;ref name="pmid16153175"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17496426"&gt;

'''Egyptian [[faience]]''' is a [[sintered]]-[[quartz]] [[ceramic]] displaying surface [[Glass transition|vitrification]] which creates a bright lustre of various colours, with blue-green being the most common. Defined as a "material made from powdered quartz covered with a true vitreous coating, usually in a transparent blue or green isotropic glass", faience is distinct from the crystalline compound [[Egyptian blue]].&lt;ref&gt;David Frederick Grose, The Toledo Museum of Art, Early Ancient Glass: Core-Formed, Rod-Formed, and Cast Vessels and Objects from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Roman Empire, 1600 BC to AD 50 (Manchester: Hudson Hills Press, 1999), 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Faience is considerably more porous than glass proper. It can be cast in molds to create vessels, jewelry  and decorative  objects.&lt;ref&gt;Grose, The Toledo Museum of Art, Early Ancient Glass, 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it contains the major constituents of [[glass]] (silica, lime) and no [[clay]] until late periods, faience is frequently discussed in surveys of ancient pottery, as in stylistic and art-historical terms objects made of it are closer to pottery styles than [[ancient Egyptian glass]]. 
[[File:Faience Vessel with Procession of Four Bulls, ca. 775-653 B.C.E..jpg|thumbnail|right|Faience Vessel with Procession of Four Bulls, ca. 775-653 B.C.E. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
Egyptian faience was very widely used for small objects from beads to small statues, and is found in both elite and popular contexts. It was the most common material for [[Scarab (artifact)|scarabs]] and other forms of amulet and [[ushabti]] figures, and used in most forms of ancient Egyptian jewellery, as the glaze made it smooth against the skin. Larger applications included cups and bowls, and [[wall tile]]s, mostly used for temples.&lt;ref&gt;Peck, William H., "The Material World of Ancient Egypt", 2013, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|1107276381}}, 9781107276383, [https://books.google.com/books?id=MV8UAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT192 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; The well-known blue figures of a [[hippopotamus]], placed in the tombs of officials, can be up to 20&amp;nbsp;cm long,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/hippopotamus-figurine Louvre: Hippopotamus figurine, Department of Egyptian Antiquities]: From the late prehistoric period to the late Middle Kingdom (circa 3800 - 1710 BC)&lt;/ref&gt; approaching the maximum practical size for faience, though the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London has a {{convert|215.9|cm|adj=on}} faience [[sceptre]] from Egypt dated 1427–1400 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O131268/sceptre/ |title=Sceptre &amp;#124; V&amp;A Search the Collections |publisher=Collections.vam.ac.uk |date=2013-11-04 |accessdate=2013-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope of the term==
[[File:Egyptian - Group of 16 Amulets Strung as a Necklace - Walters 481685-1699 - View A.jpg|thumb|left|Group of 16 amulets strung as a necklace, in the typical bright faience blue, [[Late Period of ancient Egypt|Late Period]]]]
It is called "Egyptian faience" to distinguish it from [[faience]], the [[tin-glazed pottery]] associated with [[Faenza]] in northern Italy.&lt;ref name="Nicholson and Peltenburg"&gt;Nicholson and Peltenburg 2000. Ancient Egyptian Materials and Technology. In: Nicholson, P.T. and Shaw, I.Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 177-194.137–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian faience was both exported widely in the ancient world and made locally in many places, and is found in [[Mesopotamia]], around the Mediterranean and in northern Europe as far away as [[Scotland]]. The term is used for the material wherever it was made and modern scientific analyses are often the only way of establishing the provenance of simple objects such as the very common beads.&lt;ref name="Nicholson and Peltenburg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stone and Thomas 1956"&gt;Stone and Thomas 1956. The Use and Distribution of Faience in the Ancient East and Prehistoric Europe, Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society, London 22, 37–84.–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is therefore unsatisfactory in several respects, although clear in an Ancient Egyptian context, and is increasingly rejected in museum and archaeological usage. The [[British Museum]] now calls this material "glazed composition", with the following note in the "information" box on their online collection database: &lt;blockquote&gt;"The term is used for objects with a body made of finely powdered quartz grains fused together with small amounts of alkali and/or lime through partial heating. The bodies are usually colourless but natural impurities give them a brown or greyish tint. Colourants can also be added to give it an artificial colour. It can be modelled by hand, thrown or moulded, and hardens with firing. This material is used in the context of Islamic ceramics where it is described as stonepaste (or fritware). Glazed composition is related to glass, but glass is formed by completely fusing the ingredients in a liquid melted at high temperature. This material is also popularly called faience in the contexts of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Near East. However, this is a misnomer as these objects have no relationship to the glazed pottery vessels made in Faenza, from which the faience term derives. Other authors use the terms sintered quartz, glazed frit, frit, composition, Egyptian Blue, paste or (in the 19th century) even porcelain, although the last two terms are very inappropriate as they also describe imitation gems and a type of ceramic. [[Frit]] is technically a flux."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=398153&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=faience&amp;page=1|title=figure|website=British Museum|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Introduction==

From the inception of faience in the archaeological record of [[Ancient Egypt]], the elected colors of the [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]]s varied within an array of blue-green hues. Glazed in these colours, faience was perceived as substitute for blue-green materials such as [[turquoise]], found in the [[Sinai Peninsula]], and [[lapis lazuli]] from [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref name="Nicholson and Peltenburg"/&gt; According to the archaeologist David Frederick Grose, the quest to imitate precious stones "explains why most all early glasses are opaque and brilliantly colored" and that the deepest blue color imitating lapis lazuli was likely the most sought-after.&lt;ref&gt;David Frederick Grose, The Toledo Museum of Art, Early Ancient Glass, 45.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the Predynastic graves at [[Naqada]], Badar, el-Amrah, Matmar, Harageh, Avadiyedh and El-Gerzeh, glazed [[steatite]] and faience beads are found associated with these semi-precious stones.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"&gt;Nicholson 1998. Nicholson, P.T.1993. Egyptian faience and glass. Aylesbury: Shire- Egyptology.137–142.&lt;/ref&gt; The association of faience with turquoise and lapis lazuli becomes even more conspicuous in Quennou's funerary papyrus, giving his title as the director of overseer of faience-making, using the word which strictly means lapis lazuli, which by the [[New Kingdom]] had also come to refer to the 'substitute', faience.&lt;ref name="Nicholson and Peltenburg"/&gt; The symbolism embedded in blue glazing could recall both the [[Nile]], the waters of [[heaven]] and the home of the [[god]]s, whereas green could possibly evoke images of regeneration, rebirth and vegetation.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;Friedman, F.D. (ed.). 1998. Gifts of the Nile-ancient Egyptian faience. London: Thames and Hudson. 177-194.137–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Egyptian copper industry===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Map of Ancient Egypt.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Map of Ancient Egyptian workshops or cities that have been associated with faience materials]] --&gt;

The discovery of faience glazing has tentatively been associated with the [[copper]] industry: [[bronze]] scale and corrosion products of leaded copper objects are found in the manufacture of faience [[pigment]]s.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"&gt;Kaczamrcyz, A. and Hedges. R.E.M. 1983. Ancient Egyptian Faience. Warminster: Aris and Phillips.137–142.&lt;/ref&gt; However, although the likelihood of glazed [[quartz]] pebbles developing accidentally in traces in copper [[smelting]] [[furnace]]s from the copper and wood ash is high, the regions in which these processes originate do not coincide.&lt;ref name="Petrie"&gt;Petrie, W. M. F.1909. Memphis I, London: British School of Archeology in Egypt.137–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Egyptian glass industry===
Although it appears that no [[glass]] was intentionally produced in Egypt before the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] (as the establishment of glass manufacture is generally attributed to the reign of [[Thutmose III]]), it is likely that faience, [[frit]] and glass were all made in close proximity or in the same workshop complex, since developments in one industry are reflected in others.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt; Such close relationship is reflected in the prominent similarity of the formulations of faience glaze and contemporary glass compositions.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt; Despite the differences in the pyrotechnology of glass and faience, faience being worked cold, archaeological evidence suggests that New Kingdom glass and faience production was undertaken in the same workshops.&lt;ref name="Nicholson and Peltenburg"/&gt;

==Production==

===Typical composition and access to raw materials===
Faience has been defined as the first high technology ceramic, to emphasize its status as an artificial medium, rendering it effectively a precious stone.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"&gt;Vandiver, P.B.F.1983. Egyptian faience technology, Appendix A. In: A. Kaczmarczyk and R.E.M. Hedges, Editors, Ancient Egyptian Faience,Warminster: Aris and Phillips, A1–A14&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian faience is a non-clay based ceramic composed of crushed quartz or sand, with small amounts of [[calcite]] [[lime (material)|lime]] and a mixture of [[alkali]]s, displaying surface [[Glass transition|vitrification]] due to the [[soda-lime glass|soda lime]] [[silica]] [[Ceramic glaze|glaze]] often containing copper pigments to create a bright blue-green luster.&lt;ref name="Nicholson and Peltenburg"/&gt; While in most instances domestic ores seem to have provided the bulk of the mineral pigments, evidence suggests that during periods of prosperity, raw materials not available locally, such as lead and copper, were imported.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt; Plant ash, from "[[halophyte]]" (salt-tolerant) plants typical of dry and sea areas, was the major source of alkali until the Ptolemaic Period, when [[natron]]-based alkalis almost completely replaced the previous source.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt; Although the chemical composition of faience materials varies over time and according to the status of the workshop, also as a cause of change of accessibility of raw materials, the material constitution of the glaze is at all times consistent with the generally accepted version of faience glazing.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt;

===Faience working technology===
Typical faience mixture is [[thixotropic]], that is thick at first and then soft and flowing as it begins to be formed.&lt;ref name="Kiefer and Allibert'"&gt;Kiefer, C. and Allibert, A. 2007. Pharanoic Blue Ceramics: the Process of Self-glazing. Archeology 24, 107–117&lt;/ref&gt;
This property, together with the angularity of silica particles, accounts for the gritty slumps formed when the material is wetted, rendering faience a difficult material to hold a shape.&lt;ref name="Noble'"&gt;Noble, J. V. 1969. The technique of Egyptian faience. American Journal of Archaeology 73, 435–439&lt;/ref&gt; If pressed too vigorously, this material will resist flow until it yields and cracks, due to its limited plastic deformation and low yield strength.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Predynastic, old kingdom and first intermediate period.gif|thumb|right|200px|Predynastic, Old kingdom and first intermediate period faience typologies and techniques.]] --&gt;
[[File:Egyptian - Vase with Names of Amenhotep III and Queen Tiye - Walters 48403.jpg|thumb|left|This faience vessel from the reign of [[Amenhotep III]] exhibits two different shades of blue that can be achieved by adding [[cobalt]] and [[copper]] pigments to faience paste.[[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]

===Body binding technology===
A number of possible binding agents, amongst [[Arabic gum]], [[clay]], [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[egg white]] and [[resin]], have been suggested to help in the binding process.&lt;ref name="Lucas and Harris'"/&gt; Although traces of clay have been found in most Pharaonic faience, reconstruction experiments showed that clay, [[organic gum]]s or lime while successfully improving the wet working performance, failed to improve the fired strength of the faience, or proved the gum was too sticky for the removal of objects from their molds.&lt;ref name="Nicholson and Peltenburg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucas and Harris'"&gt;Lucas, A. and Harris, J. R., 1962, Ancient Egyptian materials and industries. London: Edward Arnold. 435–439&lt;/ref&gt; The use of alkalis as binders, in the form of natron or plant ash, produced suitable results in experiments.&lt;ref name="Nicholson and Peltenburg"/&gt; Pulverized glass or sintered material of similar composition could also enhance the fired strength of faience bodies: the compositions of such glasses is in fact comparable to the published compositions of New Kingdom glass.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kühne, K.'"&gt;Kühne, K. 1974 "Frühgeschichtliche Werkstoffe auf Silikatischer Basis", Das Altertum 20, 67–80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body working technology===
Three methods have been hypothesized to shape the body of faience objects: modeling, moulding and abrasion, the last being used in conjunction with the first two.&lt;ref name="Nicholson and Peltenburg"/&gt; Modeling, scraping and grinding are the techniques most widely used in earlier times, as represented in the material qualities of Predynastic and Protodynastic faience objects.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt; Predynastic bead manufacture is essentially a cold technology, more akin to stone working than glass: a general form of faience is modeled, possibly free formed by hand, then holes are drilled to create beads.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;

In the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]], the techniques employed are molding and forming on a core, sometimes in conjunction with intermediate layers between the glaze and the body.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt; Marbleized faience, resulting from the working of different colored faience bodies together, so as to produce a uniform adherent body, also appears in this period.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt; Towards the end of the Middle Kingdom, incising, inlaying and resisting techniques appear: these were bound to become progressively popular towards the New Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt; In the New Kingdom, beads, amulets and finger rings are produced by a combination of modeling and molding techniques.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt; In this period, sculptural detail is created using inlays of different colored faience or by scraping the body to reveal the white intermediate layer in relief.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt; Moulding was first applied to faience manufacture in the Middle Kingdom by forming a model of an object, or employing a finished faience piece, impressing it in wet clay, and later by firing the clay to create a durable mold.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boyce, A.'"&gt;Notes on the manufacture and use of faience rings at Amarna. In: Kemp, B.J. Amarna Reports V. London: Egypt Exploration Society. 160-168, 160–168&lt;/ref&gt; The faience paste could then be pressed into the mold, and following drying, be re-worked through surface abrasion before firing.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt; Moulds could facilitate mass production of faience objects such as amulets rings and inlays, as evidenced by the several thousand of small open face, earth-ware clay molds excavated at Tell el Amarna.&lt;ref name="Petrie"/&gt;

Wheel throwing, possibly occurring from the New Kingdom onwards, is certainly established by the Greco-Roman period, when large amounts of clay seem to have been added to the faience body.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt; Because of the limited plasticity of faience, rendering throwing extremely difficult, a progressive increase of clay in the faience bodies culminating in the quartz, clay and glass frit bodies of Islamic times, is observed in the archaeological record.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kiefer '"&gt;Kiefer, C. 1968 Les céramiques blues, pharanoiques et leur procédé révolutionnaire d'emaillage. Industrie Céramique. May, 395–402&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ptolemaic period|Ptolemaic]] and [[Roman Egypt|Roman]] faience tends to be typologically and technologically distinct from the earlier material: it is characterized by the widespread use of moulding and high relief on vessels.&lt;ref name="Shortland and Tite'"&gt;Shortland, A.J. and Tite M.S. 2005. A technological study of Ptolemaic – early roman faience from Memphis, Egypt Archaeometry 47/1, 31–46 31–46&lt;/ref&gt; A very unusual and finely made group of figures of deities and falcons in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, apparently representing [[hieroglyph]]s that are elements from a royal inscription, perhaps from a wooden shrine, is decorated in a form of [[champleve]] (typically a technique for [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] on metal).  Depressions in the faience body were filled with coloured "vitreous pastes" and refired, followed by polishing.&lt;ref&gt;''Egypt and the Ancient Near East'', 1987, p. 82, Metropolitan Museum of Art, {{ISBN|0870994131}}, 9780870994135, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a08kkuWhv7wC&amp;pg=PA82 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glazing technology==
The technology of glazing a siliceous body with a soda lime silica glaze employs various methods discovered over time: namely application, efflorescence and cementation glazing.
[[File:Louvre Egyptologie - Vases Ramses II.jpg|thumb|left|Vases probably used for the funeral of [[Rameses II]]]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Application of glaze slurry.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Application of glaze slurry: the thickness depends on body porosity and water content of slurry]] --&gt;

===Application glazing===
In the application method, formerly assumed to be the only one used for faience glazing; silica, lime and alkalis are ground in the raw state to a small particle size, thus mixed in water to form a slurry which is then applied to the quartz core.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Petrie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucas and Harris'"/&gt; Partial fritting of the slurry favors the first stages of vitrification, which in turn lowers the final firing temperature. The slurry can be then applied to the body, through brushing or dipping, to create a fine, powdery coating.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt; Upon firing, the water from the melting glaze partially diffuses in the sand body, sintering the quartz particles and thus creating some solid bridges in the body.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt;

===Efflorescence glazing===
In the self-glazing process of efflorescence, the glazing materials, in the form of water-soluble alkali salts, are mixed with the raw crushed quartz of the core of the object.&lt;ref name="Kiefer and Allibert'"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Noble'"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Binns'"&gt;Binns. 1932. An experiment in Egyptian blue glaze. Journal of the American Ceramic Society 31–46&lt;/ref&gt; As the water in the body evaporates, the salts migrate to the surface of the object to recrystallize, creating a thin surface, which glazes upon firing.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Effluorescence of glazing.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Efflorescence glazing: the thickness depends on drying rate&lt;ref name="Vandiver"&gt; Vandiver, P.B.F.1983.A1–A14&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

===Cementation glazing===
[[File:Louvre calice forme nenuphar.JPG|thumb|Cup with [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotus]] decoration, 14.4 cm high]]
Cementation glazing, a technique discovered in the Middle Kingdom, is also a self-glazing technique.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt; The possibility of the existence of cementation glazing, also known as '[[Qom technique]]', followed the observation of this method in use at the village of '[[Qom]]' in Iran in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=" Wulff et Al., 1968'"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wulff |first1=H. E. |last2=Wulff |first2=H. S. |last3=Koch |first3=L. |date=1968 |title=Egyptian faience - a possible survival in Iran |journal=Archeology |volume=21 |pages=98–107 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this method the artifact, while buried in a glazing powder with a high flux content, is heated inside a vessel, causing the fusion of the object with the cement. During firing, the flux migrates to the quartz and combines with it to form a glassy coating.&lt;ref name=" Wulff et Al., 1968'"/&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Cementation of glazing.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cementation of glaze: thickness depends on firing time and temperature&lt;ref name="Vandiver"&gt; Vandiver, P.B.F.1983.A1–A14&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

===Alternative techniques===
A vapour glaze reaction similar to salt glazing, as an alternative glazing process, has been suggested. In this process, the vaporization or dissociation of salts leads to vapour transport through the enveloping powder to the quartz body where a glaze is formed.&lt;ref name="Williamson 1942"&gt;Williamson, R.S.1942. The Saqqara Graph. Nature 150, 607–607&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition of glazing techniques===
Although glaze compositions vary regionally and chronologically, depending on the formation of the body and the glazing process employed, objects produced with different glazing techniques do not exhibit immediate diagnostic chemical variations in their compositions.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Tite et Al. 1983'"&gt;Tite, M.S., Freestone I.C. and Bimson. M. 1983. Egyptian faience: an investigation of the methods of production, Archaeometry 25, 17–27&lt;/ref&gt; The recognition of the various glazing techniques, through microscopic observations of the degree of sintering and the vitreous phase of quartz body, is also ambiguous. For instance, objects with applied glazes and those which may have been glazed by efflorescence have overlapping characteristic features.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Tite and Bimson 1986'"&gt;Tite, M.S. and Bimson, M. 1986. Faience: an investigation of the microstructures associated with the different methods of glazing, Archaeometry 28, 69–78&lt;/ref&gt; The following proposed criteria are subject to variation caused by increases in flux concentration, firing temperatures and time at peak temperatures.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt;

''Recognition of application glazing''- Macroscopically, applied glazes vary in thickness through the body, displaying thicker glazes on bases.&lt;ref name=" Tite and Bimson 1986'"/&gt; The traces of kiln supports, as well as the characteristic tendency to run and drip leading to pooling, may indicate the orientation of the object during firing.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt; In high magnification observations, the interface boundary of body and glaze appears well defined.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt; The absence of interstitial glass in the core is characteristic of application glazing: however, the possibility of adding glazing mixture to the quartz sand body, as well as the use of pre-melted glazes in the later periods, can predictably increase the degree of sintering of the core&lt;ref name="Shortland and Tite'"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Tite and Bimson 1986'"/&gt;

''Recognition of cementation''- Objects glazed through cementation display a thin even glaze all over the body, with no drying or firing marks, and portray a fairly friable and soft body&lt;ref name="Binns'"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Tite and Bimson 1986'"/&gt; Microscopically, the concentration of copper characteristically decreases from the surface: the interaction layer is thin and well defined and the interstitial glass is absent with exception to the vicinity of the boundary layer.&lt;ref name="Vandiver"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Tite and Bimson 1986'"/&gt;

''Recognition of efflorescence glazing''- Pieces glazed by efflorescence may show traces of stand marks: the glaze appears thick and prone to cracking, thinning toward the edge of the piece and in concave areas.&lt;ref name=" Tite and Bimson 1986'"/&gt; In high magnification the interstitial glass is extensive; the unreacted salts which have not reached the surface fuse of the body accumulate in the core, creating bridges between the quartz particles.&lt;ref name=" Tite and Bimson 1986'"/&gt;

==Typologies==
[[File:Medio regno, XII-XVII dinastia, ippopotamo in faience, 1938-1539 ac ca. 01.JPG|thumb|left|[[Hippopotamus]] figure for a tomb, [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]]]]
An extensive literature has accumulated in attempt to explain the processing of Egyptian faience and develop an adequate typology that encompasses both technological choices and chemical variations of faience bodies.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucas and Harris'"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Tite and Bimson 1986'"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brill 1999'"&gt;Brill, R.H. 1999. Chemical Analyses of Early Glasses: Volume 1 (tables) and Volume 2 (catalogue), Corning, NY: Corning Museum of Glass., 69–78&lt;/ref&gt; Body color, density and luster provided the basis of the first typology developed for faience: seven variants were proposed by Lucas and Harris and still permit the archaeologist to distinguish faience objects during field sorting.&lt;ref name="Lucas and Harris'"/&gt;

===Classification of body variants===
Most of the seven variants introduced by Lucas fail to recognize the glazing technology utilized or to suggest the stylistic and technological choices embedded in the manufacture of a faience object. However, variant A describes a technologically unique product and as such is still applicable: it has a finely ground underglaze consisting of quartz particles in a glass matrix, often revealed by incisions or depressions cut into the overlying glaze.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shortland and Tite'"/&gt; Glassy faience, variant E, displays no distinct outer layer from the interior, thus it has been suggested that the term 'faience' is a misnomer and the alternative name 'imperfect glass' has been advised.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt; Regarding variant F specimens, Lucas suggests the use of lead glazes, however it appears that lead glazing was never practiced in Ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name="Kaczamrcyz and Hedges"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" Tite and Bimson 1986'"/&gt;&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Classification_of_body_variants.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Classification of Body Variants&lt;ref name="Lucas and Harris'"&gt;Lucas, A. and Harris, J. R., 1962, 435–439&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

==Workshop evidence==

The excavations led by Petrie at Tell-Amarna and Naucratis have reported finding workshop evidence.&lt;ref name="Petrie"/&gt;
Nicholson explains, however, that while a square furnace-like structure at Amarna may be related to faience production, Petrie did not encounter any actual faience Kilns at the site.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, Egyptian Faience and Glass, 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas documented a large number of molds at the palace area of Amenhotep III, at Qantir from Dynasties 19-20 and at the palace area of Naucratis also described in different sources as a scarab maker's and faience factory.&lt;ref name="Petrie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lucas and Harris'"/&gt; However, seeing there is a lack of carefully documented archaeological evidence as to the nature of faience factory sites, direct information about the glazing process does not exist.

Although recent excavations at the archaeological sites of Abydos and Amarna have supplemented our knowledge of the ancient production of faience gained from the earlier excavated sites of Lisht, Memphis and Naukratis, the differentiation of glass furnaces from faience kilns still remains problematic.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt; Replication experiments, using modern kilns and replica faience pastes, indicate that faience is fired in the range of 800-1000°&lt;ref name="Verges 1992.'"&gt;Verges, F.B. 1992.

'''Erskine College''' is a private [[Christian]] college in [[Due West, South Carolina]]. It offers an undergraduate [[liberal arts college]] and a graduate [[theological seminary]]. The college was founded in 1839 by the [[Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church]], and its sports teams compete in [[NCAA Division II]] as a member of [[Conference Carolinas]].

==History==
Established in 1839 by the Associate Reformed Synod of the South as an academy for men, the college became the first four-year, church-related college in South Carolina{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} It was named for [[Ebenezer Erskine]], one of the founders of one of the antecedent bodies of the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church and a [[pastor]]. Erskine had led a group of separatists from the [[Church of Scotland]] to found an Associate [[Presbytery (church polity)|Presbytery]]. 

Erskine began to admit women in 1894 and officially became [[coeducational]] in 1899. In 1927, it merged with [[Women's College of Due West]], founded in 1859.

==Athletics==
Erksine College teams participate as a member of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s [[NCAA Division II|Division II]]. The Flying Fleet are a member of the [[Conference Carolinas]]. Men's sports include baseball, basketball, cross country,football, golf, soccer, tennis and volleyball; while women's sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis and volleyball.

==The Flying Fleet==
Back in 1896, Erskine College began its first American football team. They had very successful seasons between 1917 and 1921. During those seasons they have wins against Wofford, Presbyterian, South Carolina, Clemson, and the Citadel. One of the memorable games of Erskine's football team was against Furman University. It was during that game in 1929 that Erskine took on the name "The Flying Fleet". They were given that name by a Greenville reporter who was blown away by their passing performance in that game. On October 18, 1948 when they defeated Florida State 14-6. It was only a couple more years until the Flying Fleet ended their football program in 1951.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a few species which have secondarily lost the ability to reproduce sexually, such as [[Bdelloidea]], and some plants and animals that routinely reproduce asexually (by [[apomixis]] and [[parthenogenesis]]) without entirely losing sex. The evolution of [[sex]] contains two related, yet distinct, themes: its ''origin'' and its ''maintenance''.

The maintenance of sexual reproduction in a highly competitive world had long been one of the major mysteries of biology given that [[asexual reproduction]] can reproduce by budding, fission, or spore formation not involving union of gametes, which reproduce at [[#xspeed|a much faster rate]] compared to sexual reproduction. 50% of offspring from sexual reproduction are males, unable to produce offspring themselves.

Since hypotheses for the origins of sex are difficult to test experimentally (outside of [[evolutionary computation]]), most current work has focused on the maintenance of sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction must offer significant [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] advantages to a species because despite the two-fold cost of sex, it dominates among multicellular forms of life, implying that the fitness of offspring produced outweighs the costs. Sexual reproduction derives from [[genetic recombination|recombination]], where parent genotypes are reorganized and shared with the offspring. This stands in contrast to single-parent asexual [[Self-replication|replication]], where the offspring is identical to the parents. Recombination supplies two [[fault-tolerance]] mechanisms at the molecular level: ''recombinational [[DNA repair]]'' (promoted during [[meiosis]] because [[homologous chromosome]]s pair at that time) and [[Complementation (genetics)|''complementation'']] (also known as [[heterosis]], hybrid vigor or masking of mutations).

==Historical perspective==

The issue features in the writings of [[Aristotle]], and modern philosophical-scientific thinking on the problem dates from at least [[Erasmus Darwin]] (1731-1802) in the 18th century.  [[August Weismann]] picked up the thread in 1889, arguing that sex served to generate [[genetic variation]], as detailed in the majority of the explanations below. On the other hand, [[Charles Darwin]] (1809-1882) concluded that the effects of hybrid vigor (complementation) "is amply sufficient to account for the ... genesis of the two sexes".{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} This is consistent with the repair and complementation hypothesis, described below. Biologists - including [[W. D. Hamilton]], [[Alexey Kondrashov]], [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]], Harris Bernstein, Carol Bernstein, Michael M. Cox, Frederic A. Hopf and Richard E. Michod - have suggested several explanations for how a vast array of different living species maintain sexual reproduction.

==Disadvantages of sex and sexual reproduction==

This section will briefly focus on the ostensible disadvantages of sexual reproduction as compared to relative advantages in asexual reproduction. Given that sexual reproduction abounds in multicellular organisms, this section is followed by a lengthy overview of theories aiming to elucidate the advantages of sex and sexual reproduction.

==={{anchor|Two-fold cost}}{{anchor|xspeed}}Population expansion cost of sex===

An asexual population can grow much more rapidly with each generation. Assume the entire population of some theoretical species has 100 total organisms consisting of two sexes (i.e. males and females) with 50:50 male-to-female representation, and only the females of this species can bear offspring. If all capable members of this population procreated once, a total of 50 offspring would be produced (the ''F1'' generation). Contrast this outcome with an asexual species, where each member of the 100-organism population is capable of bearing young. If all capable members of this asexual population procreated once, a total of 100 offspring would be produced.

[[File:Evolsex-dia1a.png|thumb|250px|This diagram illustrates the ''two-fold cost of sex''. If each individual were to contribute to the same number of offspring (two), ''(a)'' the sexual population remains the same size each generation, where the ''(b)'' asexual population doubles in size each generation.]]

This idea is sometimes referred to as the '''two-fold cost''' of sexual reproduction. It was first described mathematically by [[John Maynard Smith]].&lt;ref name="maynard"&gt;[[John Maynard Smith]] ''The Evolution of Sex'' 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; In his manuscript Smith further speculated on the impact of an asexual mutant arising in a sexual population, which suppresses meiosis and allows eggs to develop by mitotic division into offspring genetically identical to the mother.&lt;ref name="1946- 2005"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/56964580|title=Evolution : an introduction|last=1946-|first=Stearns, S. C. (Stephen C.),|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Hoekstra, Rolf F.|isbn=0199255636|edition= 2nd|location=Oxford [England]|oclc=56964580}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The mutant-asexual lineage would double its representation in the population each generation, all else being equal.

Technically the problem above is not that of sexual reproduction but a problem of having a subset of organisms incapable of bearing offspring. Indeed some multicellular organisms ([[isogamy|isogamous]]) engage in sexual reproduction but all members of the species are capable of bearing offspring.&lt;ref name="Hoekstra"&gt;[[Rolf Hoekstra]] 1987 ''The Evolution of Sex and its Consequences'' 1988 Birkhauser.&lt;/ref&gt; The two-fold reproductive disadvantage assumes that males contribute only genes to their offspring and sexual females waste half their reproductive potential on sons.&lt;ref name="1946- 2005"/&gt; Thus, in this formulation, the principal costs of sex is that males and females must successfully [[copulation (zoology)|copulate]] (which almost always involves expending energy to come together through time and space).

=== Selfish cytoplasmic genes ===
Sexual reproduction implies that chromosomes and alleles segregate and recombine in every generation, but not all genes transmitted together to the offspring.&lt;ref name="1946- 2005"/&gt; The chances of spreading mutants that cause unfair transmission at the expense of their non-mutant colleagues, these mutations are referred to as selfish because they promote their own spread at the cost of alternative alleles or host organism, these include; nuclear meiotic drivers and selfish cytoplasmic genes.&lt;ref name="1946- 2005"/&gt; Meiotic driver is defined as genes that distort meiosis to produce gametes containing themselves more than half the time and selfish cytoplasmic gene is a gene located in an organelle, plasmid, or intracellular parasite that modifies reproduction to cause its own increase at the expense of the cell or organism that carries it&lt;ref name="1946- 2005"/&gt;

===Genetic heritability cost of sex===

A sexually reproducing organism only passes on ~50% of its own genetic material to each L2 offspring. This is a consequence of the fact that gametes from sexually reproducing species are [[haploid]]. Again however, this is not applicable to all sexual organisms. There are numerous species which are sexual but do not have a genetic-loss problem because they do not produce males or females. Yeast, for example, are [[isogamy|isogamous]] sexual organisms which have two mating types which fuse and recombine their haploid genomes. Both sexes reproduce during the haploid and diploid stages of their life cycle and have a 100% chance of passing their genes into their offspring.&lt;ref name="Hoekstra" /&gt;

Some species avoid the cost of 50% of sexual reproduction, although they have "sex" (in the sense of [[genetic recombination]]). In these species (e.g., [[bacteria]], [[ciliates]], [[dinoflagellate]]s and [[diatom]]s), "sex" and reproduction occurs separately.&lt;ref name="Ridley M 2004 p. 314"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beukeboom, L. &amp; Perrin, N. (2014). ''The Evolution of Sex Determination''. Oxford University Press, p. 5-6 [https://books.google.com/books?id=d4cLBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]. Online resources, [http://www.oup.co.uk/companion/beukeboom].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages of sex and sexual reproduction==

The concept of sex includes two fundamental phenomena: the sexual process (fusion of genetic information of two individuals) and sexual differentiation (separation of this information into two parts). Depending on the presence or absence of these phenomena, the existing ways of reproduction can be divided into asexual, hermaphrodite and dioecious forms. The sexual process and sexual differentiation are different phenomena, and, in essence, are diametrically opposed. The first creates (increases) diversity of genotypes, and the second decreases it by half.
 
Reproductive advantages of the asexual forms are in quantity of the progeny and the advantages of the hermaphrodite forms – in maximum diversity. Transition from the hermaphrodite to dioecious state leads to a loss of at least half of the diversity. So, the main question is to explain the advantages given by sexual differentiation, i.e. the benefits of two separate sexes compared to hermaphrodites rather than to explain benefits of sexual forms (hermaphrodite + dioecious) over asexual ones. It has already been understood that since sexual reproduction is not associated with any clear reproductive advantages, as compared with asexual, there should be some important advantages in evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Crow J.F. (1994). Advantages of Sexual Reproduction, Dev. Gen., vol.15, pp. 205-213.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advantages due to genetic variation===

For the advantage due to genetic variation, there are three possible reasons this might happen. First, sexual reproduction can combine the effects of two beneficial [[mutation]]s in the same individual (i.e. sex aids in the spread of advantageous traits). Also, the necessary mutations do not have to have occurred one after another in a single line of descendants.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 |last=Goldstein|first=R N

 |publisher=[[Pantheon Books|Pantheon]]
 |isbn=978-0-307-37818-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2012}} Second, sex acts to bring together currently deleterious mutations to create severely unfit individuals that are then eliminated from the population (i.e. sex aids in the removal of deleterious genes). However, in organisms containing only one set of chromosomes, deleterious mutations would be eliminated immediately, and therefore removal of harmful mutations is an unlikely benefit for sexual reproduction. Lastly, sex creates new gene combinations that may be more fit than previously existing ones, or may simply lead to reduced competition among relatives.

For the advantage due to DNA repair, there is an immediate large benefit of removing DNA damage by recombinational [[DNA repair]] during [[meiosis]], since this removal allows greater survival of progeny with undamaged DNA. The advantage of [[Complementation (genetics)|complementation]] to each sexual partner is avoidance of the bad effects of their deleterious recessive genes in progeny by the masking effect of normal dominant genes contributed by the other partner.

The classes of hypotheses based on the creation of variation are further broken down below. Any number of these hypotheses may be true in any given species (they are not [[mutually exclusive events|mutually exclusive]]), and different hypotheses may apply in different species. However, a research framework based on creation of variation has yet to be found that allows one to determine whether the reason for sex is universal for all sexual species, and, if not, which mechanisms are acting in each species.

On the other hand, the maintenance of sex based on DNA repair and complementation applies widely to all sexual species.

===Protection from major genetic mutation===

In contrast to the view that sex promotes genetic variation, Heng,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Heng HH | year = 2007 | title = Elimination of altered karyotypes by sexual reproduction preserves species identity | url = | journal = Genome | volume = 50 | issue = 5| pages = 517–524 | pmid = 17612621 | doi=10.1139/g07-039 | first2 = Henry H.Q.| last2 = Heng }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gorelick and Heng&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gorelick R, Heng HH | year = 2011 | title = Sex reduces genetic variation: a multidisciplinary review | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 1088–1098 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2010.01173.x | pmid = 21091466 | last2 = Heng }}&lt;/ref&gt; reviewed evidence that sex actually acts as a constraint on genetic variation. They consider that sex acts as a coarse filter, weeding out major genetic changes, such as chromosomal rearrangements, but permitting minor variation, such as changes at the nucleotide or gene level (that are often neutral) to pass through the sexual sieve.

===Novel genotypes===
[[File:Evolsex-dia2a.svg|thumb|250px|This diagram illustrates how sex might create novel genotypes more rapidly. Two advantageous alleles ''A'' and ''B'' occur at random. The two alleles are recombined rapidly in a sexual population (top), but in an asexual population (bottom) the two alleles must independently arise because of [[clonal interference]].]]

Sex could be a method by which novel genotypes are created. Because sex combines genes from two individuals, sexually reproducing populations can more easily combine advantageous genes than can asexual populations. If, in a sexual population, two different advantageous [[alleles]] arise at different loci on a chromosome in different members of the population, a chromosome containing the two advantageous alleles can be produced within a few generations by [[Genetic recombination|recombination]]. However, should the same two alleles arise in different members of an asexual population, the only way that one chromosome can develop the other allele is to independently gain the same mutation, which would take much longer. Several studies have addressed counterarguments, and the question of whether this model is sufficiently robust to explain the predominance of sexual versus asexual reproduction.&lt;ref name="Birdsell"/&gt;{{rp|73–86}}

[[Ronald Fisher]] also suggested that sex might facilitate the spread of advantageous genes by allowing them to better escape their genetic surroundings, if they should arise on a chromosome with deleterious genes.

Supporters of these theories respond to the balance argument that the individuals produced by sexual and asexual reproduction may differ in other respects too – which may influence the persistence of sexuality. For example, in the [[Asexual reproduction#Alternation between sexual and asexual reproduction|heterogamous]] [[water flea]]s of the genus ''Cladocera'', sexual offspring form eggs which are better able to survive the winter versus those the fleas produce asexually.

===Increased resistance to parasites===
One of the most widely discussed theories to explain the persistence of sex is that it is maintained to assist sexual individuals in resisting [[parasite]]s, also known as the [[Red Queen Hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="ridley"&gt;[[Matt Ridley]] 1995 ''The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature'' 1995 Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Birdsell&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Birdsell | first1 = JA | last2 = Wills | first2 = C | year = 2003 | title = The evolutionary origin and maintenance of sexual recombination: A review of contemporary models | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4757-5190-1_2 | journal = Evolutionary Biology | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 27–137 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|113–117}}&lt;ref&gt;MacIntyre, Ross J.; Clegg, Michael, T (Eds.), Springer.

When an environment changes, previously neutral or deleterious alleles can become favourable. If the environment changed sufficiently rapidly (i.e. between generations), these changes in the environment can make sex advantageous for the individual. Such rapid changes in environment are caused by the co-evolution between hosts and parasites.

Imagine, for example that there is one gene in parasites with two alleles ''p'' and ''P'' conferring two types of parasitic ability, and one gene in hosts with two alleles ''h'' and ''H'', conferring two types of parasite resistance, such that parasites with allele ''p'' can attach themselves to hosts with the allele ''h'', and ''P'' to ''H''. Such a situation will lead to cyclic changes in allele frequency - as ''p'' increases in frequency, ''h'' will be disfavoured.

In reality, there will be several genes involved in the relationship between hosts and parasites. In an asexual population of hosts, offspring will only have the different parasitic resistance if a mutation arises. In a sexual population of hosts, however, offspring will have a new combination of parasitic resistance alleles.

In other words, like [[Lewis Carroll]]'s Red Queen, sexual hosts are continually "running" (adapting) to "stay in one place" (resist parasites).

Evidence for this explanation for the evolution of sex is provided by comparison of the rate of molecular evolution of genes for [[kinase]]s and [[immunoglobulin]]s in the [[immune system]] with genes coding other [[protein]]s. The genes coding for immune system proteins evolve considerably faster.&lt;ref name="kuma"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuma | first1 = K. | last2 = Iwabe | first2 = N. | last3 = Miyata | first3 = T. | year = 1995 | title = Functional constraints against variations on molecules from the tissue-level - slowly evolving brain-specific genes demonstrated by protein-kinase and immunoglobulin supergene families | url = | journal = Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume = 12 | issue = 1| pages = 123–130 | pmid = 7877487 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wolfe"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wolfe KH, Sharp PM | year = 1993 | title = Mammalian gene evolution - nucleotide-sequence divergence between mouse and rat | url = | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 37 | issue = 4| pages = 441–456 | doi = 10.1007/BF00178874 | pmid = 8308912 | last2 = Sharp }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further evidence for the Red Queen hypothesis was provided by observing long‐term dynamics and parasite coevolution in a "mixed" (sexual and asexual) population of snails (''[[Potamopyrgus antipodarum]]''). The number of sexuals, the number asexuals, and the rates of parasite infection for both were monitored. It was found that clones that were plentiful at the beginning of the study became more susceptible to parasites over time. As parasite infections increased, the once plentiful clones dwindled dramatically in number. Some clonal types disappeared entirely. Meanwhile, sexual snail populations remained much more stable over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1086/599080 | last1 = Jokela | first1 = Jukka | last2 = Dybdahl | first2 = Mark | last3 = Lively | first3 = Curtis | year = 2009 | title = The Maintenance of Sex, Clonal Dynamics, and Host-Parasite Coevolution in a Mixed Population of Sexual and Asexual Snails | jstor = 10.1086/599080| journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 174 | issue = s1 | pages = S43 | pmid=19441961}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090706171542.htm | title = Parasites May Have Had Role In Evolution Of Sex | date = 31 July 2009 | publisher = Science Daily | accessdate= 19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to expectation based on the [[Red Queen hypothesis]], they found that the prevalence, abundance and mean intensity of mites in sexual geckos was significantly higher than in asexuals sharing the same habitat.

In 2011, researchers used the microscopic roundworm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' as a host and the pathogenic bacteria ''[[Serratia marcescens]]'' to generate a host-parasite coevolutionary system in a controlled environment, allowing them to conduct more than 70 evolution experiments testing the Red Queen Hypothesis. They genetically manipulated the [[mating system]] of ''C. elegans'', causing populations to mate either sexually, by self-fertilization, or a mixture of both within the same population. Then they exposed those populations to the ''S. marcescens'' parasite. It was found that the self-fertilizing populations of ''C. elegans'' were rapidly driven extinct by the coevolving parasites while sex allowed populations to keep pace with their parasites, a result consistent with the Red Queen Hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1206360 | last1 = Morran | first1 = Levi T. | last2 = Schmidt | first2 = Olivia G. | last3 = Gelarden | first3 = Ian A. | last4 = Parrish Rc | first4 = Raymond C. | last5 = Lively | first5 = Curtis M. | year = 2011 | title = Running with the Red Queen: Host-Parasite Coevolution Selects for Biparental Sex | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6039/216 | journal = Science | volume = 333 | issue = 6039 | pages = 216–218 | pmid = 21737739 | pmc = 3402160}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/07/110707141158.htm | title = Sex -- As We Know It -- Works Thanks to Ever-Evolving Host-Parasite Relationships, Biologists Find | date = 9 July 2011 | publisher = Science Daily | accessdate=19 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In natural populations of ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'', self-fertilization is the predominant mode of reproduction, but infrequent out-crossing events occur at a rate of about 1%.&lt;ref name="pmid16005289"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barrière A, Félix MA |title=High local genetic diversity and low outcrossing rate in Caenorhabditis elegans natural populations |journal=Curr.

Critics of the Red Queen hypothesis question whether the constantly changing environment of hosts and parasites is sufficiently common to explain the evolution of sex.

They concluded that, although the Red Queen hypothesis favors sex under certain circumstances, it alone does not account for the ubiquity of sex. Otto and Gerstein &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 16856849 | doi=10.1042/BST0340519 |volume=34 |issue=Pt 4 |title=Why have sex?

==DNA repair and complementation==
As discussed in the earlier part of this article, sexual reproduction is conventionally explained as an adaptation for producing genetic variation through allelic recombination. As acknowledged above, however, serious problems with this explanation have led many biologists to conclude that the benefit of sex is a major unsolved problem in evolutionary biology.

An alternative "[[information theory|informational]]" approach to this problem has led to the view that the two fundamental aspects of sex, [[genetic recombination]] and [[outcrossing]], are adaptive responses to the two major sources of "noise" in transmitting genetic information. Genetic noise can occur as either physical damage to the genome (e.g. chemically altered bases of DNA or breaks in the chromosome) or replication errors (mutations)&lt;ref name="dna-repair"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bernstein H |author2=Byerly HC |author3=Hopf FA |author4=Michod RE |title=Origin of sex |journal=J.

The repair and complementation hypothesis assumes that [[genetic recombination]] is fundamentally a DNA repair process, and that when it occurs during [[meiosis]] it is an adaptation for repairing the genomic DNA which is passed on to progeny. Recombinational repair is the only repair process known which can accurately remove double-strand damages in DNA, and such damages are both common in nature and ordinarily lethal if not repaired. For instance, double-strand breaks in DNA occur about 50 times per cell cycle in human cells [see [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)]]]. Recombinational repair is prevalent from the simplest viruses to the most complex multicellular eukaryotes. It is effective against many different types of genomic damage, and in particular is highly efficient at overcoming double-strand damages. Studies of the mechanism of meiotic recombination indicate that meiosis is an adaptation for repairing DNA.&lt;ref name="replication-help"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cox MM |title=Historical overview: searching for replication help in all of the rec places |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=98 |issue=15 |pages=8173–80 |year=2001 |pmid=11459950 |doi=10.1073/pnas.131004998 |pmc=37418}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernstein2011&gt;Bernstein H, Bernstein C, Michod RE (2011). “Meiosis as an evolutionary adaptation for DNA repair.” In “DNA Repair”, Intech Publ (Inna Kruman, editor), Chapter 19: 357-382 {{DOI|10.5772/1751}} {{ISBN|978-953-307-697-3}} Available online from: http://www.intechopen.com/books/dna-repair/meiosis-as-an-evolutionary-adaptation-for-dna-repair&lt;/ref&gt; These considerations form the basis for the first part of the repair and complementation hypothesis.

In some lines of descent from the earliest organisms, the [[Ploidy|diploid]] stage of the sexual cycle, which was at first transient, became the predominant stage, because it allowed [[Complementation (genetics)|complementation]] — the masking of deleterious recessive mutations (i.e. [[Heterosis|hybrid vigor or heterosis]]). [[Outcrossing]], the second fundamental aspect of sex, is maintained by the advantage of masking mutations and the disadvantage of [[inbreeding]] (mating with a close relative) which allows expression of recessive mutations (commonly observed as [[inbreeding depression]]). This is in accord with [[Charles Darwin]],&lt;ref&gt;Darwin CR (1876). The effects of cross and self fertilisation in the vegetable kingdom. London: John Murray. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/published/1881_Worms_F1357/1876_CrossandSelfFertilisation_F1249/1876_CrossandSelfFertilisation_F1249.html] see page 462&lt;/ref&gt; who concluded that the adaptive advantage of sex is hybrid vigor; or as he put it, "the offspring of two individuals, especially if their progenitors have been subjected to very different conditions, have a great advantage in height, weight, constitutional vigor and fertility over the self fertilised offspring from either one of the same parents."

However, outcrossing may be abandoned in favor of parthenogenesis or selfing (which retain the advantage of meiotic recombinational repair) under conditions in which the costs of mating are very high. For instance, costs of mating are high when individuals are rare in a geographic area, such as when there has been a forest fire and the individuals entering the burned area are the initial ones to arrive. At such times mates are hard to find, and this favors parthenogenic species.

In the view of the repair and complementation hypothesis, the removal of DNA damage by recombinational repair produces a new, less deleterious form of informational noise, allelic recombination, as a by-product. This lesser informational noise generates genetic variation, viewed by some as the major effect of sex, as discussed in the earlier parts of this article.

==Deleterious mutation clearance==
[[Mutation]]s can have many different effects upon an organism. It is generally believed that the majority of non-neutral mutations are deleterious, which means that they will cause a decrease in the organism's overall fitness.&lt;ref name="Griffiths"&gt;Griffiths ''et al.'' 1999. Gene mutations, p197-234, ''in'' Modern Genetic Analysis, New York, W.H. Freeman and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; If a mutation has a deleterious effect, it will then usually be removed from the population by the process of [[natural selection]]. Sexual reproduction is believed to be more efficient than asexual reproduction in removing those mutations from the genome.&lt;ref name="kondrashov"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/336435a0 | last1 = Kondrashov | first1 = A. S. | authorlink = Alexey Kondrashov | year = 1988| title = Deleterious mutations and the evolution of sexual reproduction | url = | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 336 | issue = 6198| pages = 435–440 | pmid=3057385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two main hypotheses which explain how sex may act to remove deleterious [[gene]]s from the genome.

===Evading harmful mutation build-up===
{{Main|Muller's ratchet}}
While DNA is able to recombine to modify alleles, DNA is also susceptible to mutations within the sequence that can affect an organism in a negative manner. Asexual organisms do not have the ability to recombine their genetic information to form new and differing alleles. Once a mutation occurs in the DNA or other genetic carrying sequence, there is no way for the mutation to be removed from the population until another mutation occurs that ultimately deletes the primary mutation. This is rare among organisms. Hermann Joseph Muller introduced the idea that mutations build up in asexual reproducing organisms. Muller described this occurrence by comparing the mutations that accumulate as a ratchet. Each mutation that arises in asexually reproducing organisms turns the ratchet once. The ratchet is unable to be rotated backwards, only forwards. The next mutation that occurs turns the ratchet once more. Additional mutations in a population continually turn the ratchet and the mutations, mostly deleterious, continually accumulate without recombination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muller | first1 = H.J. | year = 1964 | title = The Relation of Recombination to Mutational Advance | url = | journal = Mutation Research | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 2–9 | doi=10.1016/0027-5107(64)90047-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; These mutations are passed onto the next generation because the offspring are exact genetic clones of their parent. The genetic load of organisms and their populations will increase due to the addition of multiple deleterious mutations and decrease the overall reproductive success and fitness.

For sexually reproducing populations, studies have shown that single-celled bottlenecks are beneficial for resisting mutation build-up. Passaging a population through a single-celled bottleneck involves the fertilization event occurring with haploid sets of DNA, forming one fertilized cell. For example, humans undergo a single-celled bottleneck in that the haploid sperm fertilizes the haploid egg, forming the diploid zygote, which is unicellular. This passage through a single cell is beneficial in that it lowers the chance of mutations from being passed on through multiple individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niklas|first=Karl J.|date=2014-01-01|title=The evolutionary-developmental origins of multicellularity|url=http://www.amjbot.org/content/101/1/6|journal=American Journal of Botany|language=en|volume=101|issue=1|pages=6–25|doi=10.3732/ajb.1300314|issn=0002-9122|pmid=24363320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies using ''[[Dictyostelium discoideum]]'' suggest that this unicellular initial stage is important for resisting mutations due to the importance of high relatedness. Highly related individuals are more closely related, and more clonal, whereas less related individuals are less so, increasing the likelihood that an individual in a population of low relatedness may have a detrimental mutation. Highly related populations also tend to thrive better than lowly related because the cost of sacrificing an individual is greatly offset by the benefit gained by its relatives and in turn, its genes, according to [[kin selection]]. The studies with ''D. discoideum'' showed that conditions of high relatedness resisted mutant individuals more effectively than those of low relatedness, suggesting the importance of high relatedness to resist mutations from proliferating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuzdzal-Fick|first=Jennie J.|last2=Fox|first2=Sara A.|last3=Strassmann|first3=Joan E.|last4=Queller|first4=David C.|date=2011-12-16|title=High Relatedness Is Necessary and Sufficient to Maintain Multicellularity in Dictyostelium|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/334/6062/1548|journal=Science|language=en|volume=334|issue=6062|pages=1548–1551|doi=10.1126/science.1213272|issn=0036-8075|pmid=22174251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal of deleterious genes===
[[File:Synergistic versus antagonistic epistasis.svg|thumb|200px|Diagram illustrating different relationships between numbers of mutations and fitness. Kondrashov's model requires ''synergistic epistasis'', which is represented by the red line&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) ''Evolution'', 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charlesworth B, Charlesworth D (2010) ''Elements of Evolutionary Genetics''. Roberts and Company Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; - each subsequent mutation has a disproportionately large effect on the organism's fitness.]]

This hypothesis was proposed by [[Alexey Kondrashov]], and is sometimes known as the ''deterministic mutation hypothesis''.&lt;ref name="kondrashov"/&gt; It assumes that the majority of deleterious mutations are only slightly deleterious, and affect the individual such that the introduction of each additional mutation has an increasingly large effect on the fitness of the organism. This relationship between number of mutations and fitness is known as [[epistasis|''synergistic epistasis'']].

By way of [[analogy]], think of a [[Automobile|car]] with several minor faults. Each is not sufficient alone to prevent the car from running, but in combination, the faults combine to prevent the car from functioning.

Similarly, an organism may be able to cope with a few defects, but the presence of many mutations could overwhelm its backup mechanisms.

Kondrashov argues that the slightly deleterious nature of mutations means that the population will tend to be composed of individuals with a small number of mutations. Sex will act to [[Genetic recombination|recombine]] these genotypes, creating some individuals with fewer deleterious mutations, and some with more. Because there is a major selective disadvantage to individuals with more mutations, these individuals die out. In essence, sex compartmentalises the deleterious mutations.

There has been much criticism of Kondrashov's theory, since it relies on two key restrictive conditions. The first requires that the rate of deleterious mutation should exceed one per genome per generation in order to provide a substantial advantage for sex. While there is some empirical evidence for it (for example in [[Drosophila]]&lt;ref name="Drosophila"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Whitlock | first1 = M.

Thus, for instance, for the sexual species ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' (yeast) and ''Neurospora crassa'' (fungus), the mutation rate per genome per replication are 0.0027 and 0.0030 respectively. For the nematode worm ''Caenorhabditis elegans'', the mutation rate per effective genome per sexual generation is 0.036.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 9560386 | volume=148 | issue=4 | title=Rates of spontaneous mutation | pmc=1460098 |date=April 1998 | pages=1667–86 |author1=Drake JW |author2=Charlesworth B |author3=Charlesworth D |author4=Crow JF | journal = Genetics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, there should be strong interactions among loci (synergistic epistasis), a mutation-fitness relation for which there is only limited evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 28473589 | title=Negative selection in humans and fruit flies involves synergistic epistasis | journal = Science | doi=10.1126/science.aah5238 | volume=356 | pages=539–542 | last1 = Sohail | first1 = M | last2 = Vakhrusheva | first2 = OA | last3 = Sul | first3 = JH | last4 = Pulit | first4 = SL | last5 = Francioli | first5 = LC | last6 = van den Berg | first6 = LH | last7 = Veldink | first7 = JH | last8 = de Bakker | first8 = PIW | last9 = Bazykin | first9 = GA | last10 = Kondrashov | first10 = AS | last11 = Sunyaev | first11 = SR | year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, there is also the same amount of evidence that mutations show no epistasis (purely additive model) or antagonistic interactions (each additional mutation has a disproportionally ''small'' effect).

==Other explanations==

===Geodakyan's evolutionary theory of sex===
Geodakyan suggested that sexual dimorphism provides a partitioning of a species' phenotypes into at least two functional partitions: a female partition that secures beneficial features of the species and a male partition that emerged in species with more variable and unpredictable environments. The male partition is suggested to be an "experimental" part of the species that allows the species to expand their ecological niche, and to have alternative configurations. This theory underlines the higher variability and higher mortality in males, in comparison to females. This functional partitioning also explains the higher susceptibility to disease in males, in comparison to females and therefore includes the idea of "protection against parasites" as another functionality of male sex. Geodakyan's evolutionary theory of sex was developed in Russia in 1960-80 and was not known to the West till the era of the Internet. Trofimova, who analysed psychological sex differences, hypothesised that the male sex might also provide a "redundancy pruning" function.&lt;ref name=Trofimova&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trofimova |first1=I.|year=2015| title= Do psychological sex differences reflect evolutionary bi-sexual partitioning? |journal =American Journal of Psychology|volume=128|issue=4 |pages=485–514|doi= 10.5406/amerjpsyc.128.4.0485| PMID=26721176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speed of evolution===
Ilan Eshel suggested that sex prevents rapid evolution. He suggests that [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] breaks up favourable gene combinations more often than it creates them, and sex is maintained because it ensures selection is longer-term than in asexual populations - so the population is less affected by short-term changes.&lt;ref name=Birdsell /&gt;{{rp|85–86}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 5527627 | volume=1 | issue=1 | title=On the evolutionary effect of recombination |date=May 1970 | pages=88–100 | author=Eshel I, Feldman MW | journal = Theoretical population biology | doi=10.1016/0040-5809(70)90043-2| last2=Feldman }}&lt;/ref&gt; This explanation is not widely accepted, as its assumptions are very restrictive.

It has recently been shown in experiments with ''[[Chlamydomonas]]'' algae that sex can remove the speed limit{{clarify|date=July 2013}} on evolution.&lt;ref name="speed"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colegrave | first1 = N. | year = 2002 | pmid = 12478292 | title = Sex releases the speed limit on evolution | doi = 10.1038/nature01191 | journal = Nature | volume = 420 | issue = 6916| pages = 664–666 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An information theoretic analysis using a simplified but useful model shows that in asexual reproduction, the information gain per generation of a species is limited to 1 bit per generation, while in sexual reproduction, the information gain is bounded by &lt;math&gt;\surd G&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the genome in bits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=David MacKay | title=Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms | publisher=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge |date=2003 | pages=269–280 | url=http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libertine bubble theory===
The evolution of sex can alternatively be described as a kind of gene exchange that is independent from reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lesbarrères D | year = 2011 | title = Sex or no sex, reproduction is not the question | url = | journal = BioEssays | volume = 33 | issue = 11| page = 818 | doi = 10.1002/bies.201100105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Thierry Lodé]]'s "libertine bubble theory", sex originated from an archaic gene transfer process among prebiotic bubbles.&lt;ref name=sexisnot&gt;{{cite journal | author = LODÉ T | year = 2011 | title = Sex is not a solution for reproduction: the libertine bubble theory | doi=10.1002/bies.201000125 | journal = BioEssays | volume = 33 | issue = 6| pages = 419–422 | pmid = 21472739 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = LODÉ T | year = 2011 | title = The origin of sex was interaction, not reproduction (what's sex really all about), Big Idea | url = http://www.pagepress.org/journals/index.php/eb/article/view/eb.2012.e1 | journal = New Scientist | volume = 212 | issue = 2837| pages = 30–31 | doi = 10.1016/S0262-4079(11)62719-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The contact among the pre-biotic bubbles could, through simple food or parasitic reactions, promote the transfer of genetic material from one bubble to another. That interactions between two organisms be in balance appear to be a sufficient condition to make these interactions evolutionarily efficient, i.e. to select bubbles that tolerate these interactions (“libertine” bubbles) through a blind evolutionary process of self-reinforcing gene correlations and compatibility.&lt;ref name="LODÉ T 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | author = LODÉ T | year = 2012 | title = Sex and the origin of genetic exchanges | url = | journal = Trends Evol Biol | volume = 4 | issue = | page = e1 | doi = 10.4081/eb.2012.e1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "libertine bubble theory" proposes that meiotic sex evolved in proto-eukaryotes to solve a problem that bacteria did not have, namely a large amount of DNA material, occurring in an archaic step of proto-cell formation and genetic exchanges. So that, rather than providing selective advantages through reproduction, sex could be thought of as a series of separate events which combines step-by-step some very weak benefits of recombination, meiosis, gametogenesis and syngamy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lodé | first1 = T | year = 2012 | title = Have sex or not ?

==Origin of sexual reproduction==
{{Life timeline}}
Many [[protist]]s reproduce sexually, as do the multicellular [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, and [[fungi]]. In the eukaryotic fossil record, sexual reproduction first appeared by 1.2 billion years ago in the [[Proterozoic|Proterozoic Eon]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://paleobiol.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/26/3/386 Nicholas J. Butterfield, "Bangiomorpha pubescens n. gen., n. sp.: implications for the evolution of sex, multicellularity, and the Mesoproterozoic/Neoproterozoic radiation of eukaryotes"]&lt;/ref&gt; All sexually reproducing [[eukaryotic]] organisms likely derive from a single-celled common ancestor.&lt;ref name="Letunic I and Bork P"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernstein2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernstein2010&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bernstein H, Bernstein C | year = 2010 | title = Evolutionary origin of recombination during meiosis | url = | journal = BioScience | volume = 60 | issue = 7| pages = 498–505 | doi = 10.1525/bio.2010.60.7.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sexisnot/&gt; It is probable that the evolution of sex was an integral part of the evolution of the first eukaryotic cell.&lt;ref name="Ploompuu1999"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ploompuu, T.|year=1999|title=Biosüsteemide mälu teooria|trans-title=Why the eukaryotic cell memory was needed|journal=Schola biotheoretica|language=Estonian|location=Tartu|publisher=Sulemees|volume=XXV|pages=51–56|ISBN=9985908155}} Abstract in English available online: [http://www.tlu.ee/~toenu/ingl/euk_rakk.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid29436502"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hörandl E, Speijer D |title=How oxygen gave rise to eukaryotic sex |journal=Proc.

===Diploidy===
Organisms need to replicate their genetic material in an efficient and reliable manner. The necessity to repair genetic damage is one of the leading theories explaining the origin of sexual reproduction. [[Diploid]] individuals can repair a damaged section of their DNA via [[homologous recombination]], since there are two copies of the gene in the cell and if one copy is [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|damaged]], the other copy is unlikely to be damaged at the same site.

A harmful mutation in a [[haploid]] individual, on the other hand, is more likely to become fixed (i.e. permanent), since any [[DNA repair]] mechanism would have no source to recover the original undamaged sequence from.&lt;ref name="dna-repair" /&gt; The most primitive form of sex may have been one organism with damaged DNA replicating an undamaged strand from a similar organism in order to repair itself.&lt;!--

===Meiosis===
If, as evidence indicates, sexual reproduction arose very early in eukaryotic evolution, the essential features of meiosis may have already been present in the prokaryotic ancestors of eukaryotes.&lt;ref name =Bernstein2010 /&gt;&lt;ref name=BernsteinIntech/&gt; In extant organisms, proteins with central functions in meiosis are similar to key proteins in [[transformation (genetics)|natural transformation]] in bacteria and DNA transfer in [[archaea]].&lt;ref name=BernsteinIntech&gt;Bernstein, H., Bernstein, C. Evolutionary origin and adaptive function of meiosis. In “Meiosis”, Intech Publ (Carol Bernstein and Harris Bernstein editors), Chapter 3: 41-75 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernsteinarchaea&gt;Bernstein H, Bernstein C. Sexual communication in archaea, the precursor to meiosis. pp. 103-117 in Biocommunication of Archaea (Guenther Witzany, ed.) 2017. Springer International Publishing {{ISBN|978-3-319-65535-2}}  DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-65536-9&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[recA]] recombinase, that catalyses the key functions of DNA homology search and strand exchange in the bacterial sexual process of transformation, has orthologs in eukaryotes that perform similar functions in meiotic recombination&lt;ref name=BernsteinIntech /&gt; (see Wikipedia articles [[RecA]], [[RAD51]] and [[DMC1]]).

Natural transformation in bacteria, DNA transfer in archaea, and [[meiosis]] in eukaryotic microorganisms are induced by stressful circumstances such as overcrowding, resource depletion, and DNA damaging conditions.&lt;ref name="LODÉ T 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BernsteinIntech /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bernsteinarchaea /&gt; This suggests that these sexual processes are adaptations for dealing with stress, particularly stress that causes DNA damage. In bacteria, these stresses induce an altered physiologic state, termed competence, that allows active take-up of DNA from a donor bacterium and the integration of this DNA into the recipient genome (see [[Natural competence]]) allowing recombinational repair of the recipients’ damaged DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Michod RE, Wojciechowski MF, Hoelzer MA |year=1988 |title=DNA repair and the evolution of transformation in the bacterium Bacillus subtilis |journal=Genetics |volume=118 |issue=1 |pages=31–39 |pmid=8608929 |pmc=1203263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If environmental stresses leading to DNA damage were a persistent challenge to the survival of early microorganisms, then selection would likely have been continuous through the prokaryote to eukaryote transition,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BernsteinIntech /&gt; and adaptative adjustments would have followed a course in which bacterial transformation or archaeal DNA transfer naturally gave rise to sexual reproduction in eukaryotes.

===Virus-like RNA-based origin===
Sex might also have been present even earlier, in the hypothesized [[RNA world]] that preceded DNA cellular life forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=6164094 |volume=244 |issue=4 |title=The origin of genetic information |date=April 1981 |pages=88–92, 96, et passim |vauthors=Eigen M, Gardiner W, Schuster P, Winkler-Oswatitsch R |journal=Scientific American |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0481-88}}&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed origin of sex in the RNA world was based on the type of sexual interaction that is known to occur in extant single-stranded segmented RNA viruses, such as influenza virus, and in extant double-stranded segmented RNA viruses such as reovirus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=6209512 |doi=10.1016/S0022-5193(84)80178-2 |volume=110 |issue=3 |title=Origin of sex |date=October 1984 |pages=323–351 |vauthors=Bernstein H, Byerly HC, Hopf FA, Michod RE |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to conditions that cause RNA damage could have led to blockage of replication and death of these early RNA life forms. Sex would have allowed re-assortment of segments between two individuals with damaged RNA, permitting undamaged combinations of RNA segments to come together, thus allowing survival. Such a regeneration phenomenon, known as multiplicity reactivation, occurs in influenza virus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barry RD |year=1961 |title=The multiplication of influenza virus. II. Multiplicity reactivation of ultraviolet irradiated virus |journal=Virology |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=398–405 |pmid=13687359 |doi=10.1016/0042-6822(61)90330-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and reovirus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McClain ME, Spendlove RS |year=1966 |title=Multiplicity reactivation of reovirus particles after exposure to ultraviolet light |journal=J Bacteriol |volume=92 |issue=5 |pages=1422–1429 |pmid=5924273 |pmc=276440}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parasitic DNA elements===
Another theory is that sexual reproduction originated from [[Selfish DNA|selfish parasitic genetic elements]] that exchange genetic material (that is: copies of their own genome) for their transmission and propagation. In some organisms, sexual reproduction has been shown to enhance the spread of parasitic genetic elements (e.g.: yeast, filamentous fungi).&lt;ref name="hickey"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hickey D |title=Selfish DNA: a sexually-transmitted nuclear parasite |journal=Genetics |volume=101 |issue=3–4 |pages=519–531 |year=1982 |pmid=6293914 |pmc=1201875}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bacterial conjugation]] is a form of genetic exchange that some sources describe as “sex”, but technically is not a form of reproduction, even though it is a form of [[horizontal gene transfer]]. However, it does support the “selfish gene” part theory, since the gene itself is propagated through the [[F-plasmid]].&lt;ref name="tatiana" /&gt;

A similar origin of sexual reproduction is proposed to have evolved in ancient [[haloarchaea]] as a combination of two independent processes: [[jumping genes]] and [[plasmid]] swapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Extreme Microbes |first=Shiladitya |last=DasSarma |year=2007 |volume=95 |pages=224–231 |doi=10.1511/2007.65.224 |journal=American Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partial predation===
A third theory is that sex evolved as a form of [[cannibalism]]: One primitive organism ate another one, but instead of completely digesting it, some of the “eaten” organism's DNA was incorporated into the DNA of the “eater”.&lt;ref name="tatiana" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ploompuu1999/&gt;

===Vaccination-like process===
Sex may also be derived from another prokaryotic process. A comprehensive theory called “origin of sex as vaccination” proposes that eukaryan sex-as-[[fertilisation|syngamy]] (fusion sex) arose from prokaryan unilateral sex-as-infection, when infected hosts began swapping nuclearised genomes containing coevolved, vertically transmitted symbionts that provided protection against horizontal superinfection by other, more virulent symbionts.

Consequently, sex-as-meiosis (fission sex) would evolve as a host strategy for uncoupling from (and thereby render impotent) the acquired symbiotic/parasitic genes.&lt;ref name="sterrer"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sterrer W |title=On the origin of sex as vaccination |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=216 |issue=4 |pages=387–396 |year=2002 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.2002.3008 |pmid=12151256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanistic origin of sexual reproduction==
While theories positing fitness benefits that led to the origin of sex are often problematic{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}, several theories addressing the emergence of the mechanisms of sexual reproduction have been proposed.

===Viral eukaryogenesis===
{{main| Viral eukaryogenesis}}
The viral eukaryogenesis (VE) theory proposes that eukaryotic cells arose from a combination of a [[lysogenic]] virus, an [[archaea]]n, and a [[bacterium]]. This model suggests that the nucleus originated when the lysogenic virus incorporated genetic material from the archaean and the bacterium and took over the role of information storage for the amalgam. The archaeal host transferred much of its functional genome to the virus during the evolution of cytoplasm, but retained the function of gene translation and general metabolism. The bacterium transferred most of its functional genome to the virus as it transitioned into a [[mitochondria|mitochondrion]].&lt;ref name="bell-2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bell, PJ |title=Viral eukaryogenesis: Was the ancestor of the nucleus a complex DNA virus? |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |volume=53 |issue=3 |pages=251–256 |year=2001 |doi=10.1007/s002390010215 |pmid=11523012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For these transformations to lead to the eukaryotic cell cycle, the VE hypothesis specifies a pox-like virus as the lysogenic virus. A pox-like virus is a likely ancestor because of its fundamental similarities with eukaryotic nuclei. These include a double stranded DNA genome, a linear chromosome with short [[telomere|telomeric]] repeats, a complex membrane bound capsid, the ability to produce capped mRNA, and the ability to export the capped mRNA across the viral membrane into the [[cytoplasm]]. The presence of a lysogenic pox-like virus ancestor explains the development of meiotic division, an essential component of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref name="bell-2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bell, PJ |title=Sex and the eukaryotic cell cycle is consistent with a viral ancestry for the eukaryotic nucleus |journal=Journal of Theoretical  Biology |volume=243 |issue=1 |pages=54–63 |year=2006 |doi=10.1016/j.jtbi.2006.05.015 |pmid=16846615 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Meiotic]] division in the VE hypothesis arose because of the evolutionary pressures placed on the lysogenic virus as a result of its inability to enter into the [[lytic cycle]]. This selective pressure resulted in the development of processes allowing the viruses to spread horizontally throughout the population. The outcome of this selection was cell-to-cell fusion. (This is distinct from the conjugation methods used by bacterial plasmids under evolutionary pressure, with important consequences.)&lt;ref name="bell-2001" /&gt; The possibility of this kind of fusion is supported by the presence of fusion proteins in the envelopes of the pox viruses that allow them to fuse with host membranes. These proteins could have been transferred to the cell membrane during viral reproduction, enabling cell-to-cell fusion between the virus host and an uninfected cell. The theory proposes meiosis originated from the fusion between two cells infected with related but different viruses which recognised each other as uninfected. After the fusion of the two cells, incompatibilities between the two viruses result in a meiotic-like cell division.&lt;ref name="bell-2006" /&gt;

The two viruses established in the cell would initiate replication in response to signals from the host cell. A mitosis-like cell cycle would proceed until the viral membranes dissolved, at which point linear chromosomes would be bound together with centromeres. The homologous nature of the two viral centromeres would incite the grouping of both sets into tetrads. It is speculated that this grouping may be the origin of crossing over, characteristic of the first division in modern meiosis. The partitioning apparatus of the mitotic-like cell cycle the cells used to replicate independently would then pull each set of chromosomes to one side of the cell, still bound by centromeres. These centromeres would prevent their replication in subsequent division, resulting in four daughter cells with one copy of one of the two original pox-like viruses. The process resulting from combination of two similar pox viruses within the same host closely mimics meiosis.&lt;ref name="bell-2006" /&gt;

===Neomuran revolution===
An alternative theory, proposed by [[Thomas Cavalier-Smith]], was labeled the [[Neomura|Neomuran revolution]]. The designation "Neomuran revolution" refers to the appearances of the common ancestors of eukaryotes and archaea. Cavalier-Smith proposes that the first neomurans emerged 850 million years ago. Other molecular biologists assume that this group appeared much earlier, but Cavalier-Smith dismisses these claims because they are based on the "theoretically and empirically" unsound model of [[molecular clock]]s. Cavalier-Smith's theory of the Neomuran revolution has implications for the evolutionary history of the cellular machinery for recombination and sex. It suggests that this machinery evolved in two distinct bouts separated by a long period of stasis; first the appearance of recombination machinery in a bacterial ancestor which was maintained for 3 Gy,{{Clarify|date=March 2011}} until the neomuran revolution when the mechanics were adapted to the presence of [[nucleosome]]s. The archaeal products of the revolution maintained recombination machinery that was essentially bacterial, whereas the eukaryotic products broke with this bacterial continuity. They introduced cell fusion and ploidy cycles into cell life histories. Cavalier-Smith argues that both bouts of mechanical evolution were motivated by similar selective forces: the need for accurate DNA replication without loss of viability.&lt;ref name="TCSmith"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cavalier-Smith, Thomas |title=Cell evolution and Earth history: Stasis and revolution |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=361 |issue=1470 |pages=969–1006 |year=2006 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.1842 |pmid=16754610 |pmc=1578732 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
Forever wars can happen for a variety of reasons, such as military or political reasons.

=== Military ===
Poor military planning is one of the major reasons that a forever war can occur. If the territory gained in a war is not occupied/controlled properly, this allows a deadly insurgency to occur, thus potentially stretching out a war that never ends, which is termed as a forever war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, warfare that is fought irregularly, such as rebellions in Africa, do not have a set of military objectives in mind, usually because these rebel groups intend to commit war crimes against the civilian population. Thus, the lack of actual military goals can in itself be a reason that a forever war can occur.  As well, a very large defense budget may also be a factor in the transpiration of a forever war.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spinney|first=Franklin|date=Fall 2011|title=The Domestic Roots of Perpetual War|url=|journal=Challenge|volume=54|pages=54–69|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows a country to fight several forever wars. As of 2018, the United States has a high military budget that is larger than their budget for World War II, allowing for inflation, which enables them to fight wars forever in Iraq and other countries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The idea of a forever war can also extend to [[civil war]]s. Simply, civil wars can last for a prolonged period of time whenever a military [[stalemate]] occurs between both sides.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fearon|first=James D.|title=Why Do Some Civil Wars Last So Much Longer than Others?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022343304043770|journal=Journal of Peace Research|volume=41|issue=3|pages=275–301|doi=10.1177/0022343304043770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political ===
One major political reason as to why a forever war can occur is due to the lack of [[democracy]] in a country, as this makes a country more likely to become engulfed in a civil war.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Politically, forever wars can occur in order to keep money flowing into institutions, such as the [[Military-industrial-Congressional complex|Military-Industrial-Congressional Complex]] (MICC).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thus, forever wars can serve as domestic political engines. The continuous changes in capitalism in globalized markets influences policy makers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aravamudan|first=Srinivas|date=2009|title=Introduction: Perpetual War|jstor=25614381|journal=PMLA|volume=124|issue=5|pages=1505–1514}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, causes the policy makers to promote policies of continuing and expanding wars.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As well, forever wars can be used by small armed groups in an attempt to wear down a larger group or country. For example, in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]] and the beginning of the [[War on Terror]], [[Al-Qaeda]] attempted to get the United States involved in a prolonged guerrilla war in [[Afghanistan]], or in other words a forever war.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mondrian.die.udec.cl/~mmedina/Desvarios/Files/Danner-TakingStockOfTheForeverWar.pdf|title=Taking Stock of the Forever War|last=Danner|first=Mark|date=11 September 2005|work=The New York Times|access-date=28 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this was to destroy American will to fight such a long war, and ultimately force the United States to not only withdraw from Afghanistan, but from the [[Middle East]] as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Thus, forever wars can be started in an attempt to achieve political goals for armed groups.

=== Other Reasons ===
Wars that are between ethnic and/or ideological groups can also be a cause of a forever war.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is because these wars are harder to end with a negotiated peace deal due to the different interests of the two sides as it is difficult to meet the demands of both parties.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As well, financial support for a rebellion or country, such as rebel groups selling illegal products or taxing civilians on one side of the conflict can cause a forever war, as the financial assistance allows rebellion groups to be able to fight longer with more supplies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== The War On Terror ==
{{Main|The War on Terror}}

Traditionally, the term [[War]] referred to the physical and conventional act of engaging in armed conflict. However, the implications of what war entails has evolved over time. The War on Terror has often been cited as a forever war, being a war with “no specific battlefield and the enemy isn’t an army”.&lt;ref name="Inside terrorism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffman|first1=Bruce|title=Inside terrorism|date=2006|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780231126991|edition= Revised and expanded}}&lt;/ref&gt; The War on Terror has been directed at countless 'enemies' as it has no clear target. Georgetown University Historian [[Bruce Hoffman]] describes traditional war as a war that "ends with the vanquishing of an opponent, with some form or armistice or truce- some kind of surrender instrument or document".&lt;ref name="Inside terrorism"/&gt; In contrast, The War on Terror continues to rage on, with no end in sight.

The [[War on Terror]] arose after the [[September 11th Terrorist Attacks]] in the [[United States]]. As a response, the United States government were looking to declare war, unfortunately they did not know who to declare it on. In the hours following the attack, [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|The Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF)]] began to take form. American lawyer [[Timothy Flanigan]] was tasked with constructing the legislation that would become the framework as a basis for the War on Terror.&lt;ref name="Season 12 Episode 7"/&gt; This document has been the legal justification for the United States War on Terror. With extremely vague wording and broad language, the AUMF allowed for the President to justify attacks, strikes, detainments and countless other military actions under the premise of protecting American citizens and avenging the September 11th attacks.{{quote|"That the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on 9/11 or harbor such organizations or persons in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=United States of America|first1=107th Congress|title=Public Law 107-40|date=September 18, 2001|publisher=Congressional Record|edition= Vol. 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These words lead to arguably the longest war in American history.&lt;ref name="Season 12 Episode 7"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kielty|first1=Matthew|last2=Padgett|first2=Kelsey|title=60 Words|url=http://www.radiolab.org/story/60-words/|website=RadioLab|publisher=RadioLab|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The War on Drugs == 
{{Main|War on Drugs}}

The 1960s gave birth to a rebellious movement that popularized drug use. "Hippies" sought to expand their minds with the use of hallucinogens like LSD, whilst many soldiers returned from the [[Vietnam War]] with heroin habits. Demand for drugs skyrocketed in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="The United States War on Drugs"&gt;{{cite web|title=The United States War on Drugs|url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/paradox/htele.html|website=web.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1971, [[President Nixon]] declared a “war on drugs.” He dramatically increased the size and presence of federal drug control agencies, and pushed through measures such as mandatory sentencing and no-knock warrants.

The Federal Bureau of Narcotics also used propaganda as a preventative measure. Myths and horror stories were spread about drugs. Marijuana was blamed for bizarre cases of insanity, murder, and sex crimes.&lt;ref name="The United States War on Drugs"/&gt;

A top Nixon aide, [[John Ehrlichman]], later admitted: “You want to know what this was really all about. The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying. We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”Nixon temporarily placed marijuana in Schedule One, the most restrictive category of drugs, pending review by a commission he appointed led by Republican Pennsylvania Governor [[Raymond Shafer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of the Drug War|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/issues/brief-history-drug-war|website=Drug Policy Alliance|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, after a failed experimental and controversial methadone maintenance program, Nixon addressed Congress and declared "as long as there is a demand, there will be those willing to take the risks of meeting the demand.&lt;ref name="The United States War on Drugs"/&gt; " In this statement, he publicly proclaimed that all efforts of interdiction and eradication are destined to fail.

Not learning from past presidents, [[President Reagan]] gave a speech in 1981 that mirrored that of Nixon's 10 years prior. He believed it was more effective to take the customers away from the drug, rather than take the drugs from the customers.&lt;ref name="The United States War on Drugs"/&gt; The average annual funding for eradication and interdiction programs increased from $437 million during [[President Carter|Carter]]'s presidency to $1.4 billion during Reagan's first term.&lt;ref name="The United States War on Drugs"/&gt;

Reagan's initiatives focused on "getting tough" on drugs. The [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986|1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act]] gave the drug user full accountability. Users were to be prosecuted for possession and accordingly penalized.&lt;ref name="The United States War on Drugs"/&gt; This demand side of drug policy reflects a colonial, moralist view of addiction.

Since the initial declaration of a "War on Drugs" in 1971, the United States has: 1) Put half a million people in prison: $10 Billion per year 2) Spent billions on expanded law enforcement 3) Fomented violence and death (in gang turf wars, overdoses, shared needles/AIDS) 4) Eroded civil rights (property can be confiscated BEFORE you are found guilty) 5) Enriched criminal organizations &lt;ref name="The United States War on Drugs"/&gt;

A war that seemingly has no end. A war fought for all sorts of reasons, none of them clear. This "war" was approached differently by each consecutive president, none of whom were successful to any degree in the eradication or control of drugs in the U.S..

'''GenoCAD''' is one of the earliest [[computer assisted design]] tools for [[synthetic biology]].&lt;ref name="High-level"/&gt; The software is a bioinformatics tool developed and maintained by [http://www.genofab.com GenoFAB]. GenoCAD facilitates the design of protein expression vectors, artificial gene networks and other genetic constructs for [[genetic engineering]] and is based on the theory of [[formal languages]].&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt; GenoCAD can be used online at [http://www.genocad.com www.genocad.com].

==History==
GenoCAD originated as an offshoot of an attempt to formalize functional constraints of genetic constructs using the theory of [[formal languages]]. In 2007, the website genocad.org (now retired) was set up as a proof of concept by researchers at [[Virginia Bioinformatics Institute]], [[Virginia Tech]]. Using the website, users could design genes by repeatedly replacing high-level genetic constructs with lower level genetic constructs, and eventually with actual [[DNA]] sequences.&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt;

On August 31, 2009, the [[National Science Foundation]] granted a three-year $1,421,725 grant to Dr. Jean Peccoud, an associate professor at the [[Virginia Bioinformatics Institute]] at [[Virginia Tech]], for the development of GenoCAD.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; GenoCAD was and continues to be developed by GenoFAB, a company founded by Peccoud (currently [[Chief science officer|CSO]] and acting [[CEO]]), who was also one of the authors of the originating study.&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt;

Source code for GenoCAD was originally released on [[Sourceforge]] in December 2009.&lt;ref name=commit&gt;{{cite web|title=GenoCAD Code|url=http://sourceforge.net/p/genocad/code/commit_browser|work=Sourceforge|accessdate=8 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GenoCAD version 2.0 was released in November 2011 and included the ability to simulate the behavior of the designed genetic code. This feature was a result of a collaboration with the team behind [[COPASI]].&lt;ref name="release notes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson |first=Mandy |title=GenoCAD Release Notes |url=http://peccoud.vbi.vt.edu/genocad-release-notes/ |work=Peccoud Lab |accessdate=8 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013161353/http://peccoud.vbi.vt.edu/genocad-release-notes/ |archivedate=13 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, 2015, Peccoud and colleagues published a library of biological parts, called GenoLIB, that can be incorporated into the GenoCAD platform.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:GenoCAD workflow.png|thumb|right|upright=1.5|Workflow of GenoCAD]]
 
* '''Management of genetic sequences''': The purpose of this group of features is to help users identify, within large collections of genetic parts, the parts needed for a project and to organize them in project-specific libraries.
** ''Genetic parts'': Parts have a unique identifier, a name and a more general description. They also have a [[DNA sequence]]. Parts are associated with a [[formal grammar|grammar]] and assigned to a parts category such a [[promoter (biology)|promoter]], [[gene]], etc.
** ''Parts libraries'': Collections of parts are organized in libraries. In some cases part libraries correspond to parts imported from a single source such as another [[sequence database]]. In other cases, libraries correspond to the parts used for a particular design project. Parts can be moved from one library to another through a temporary storage area called the cart (analogous to e-commerce shopping carts).
** ''Searching parts'': Users can search the parts database using the [[Lucene]] search engine. Basic and advanced search modes are available. Users can develop complex queries and save them for future reuse.
** ''Importing/Exporting parts'': Parts can be imported and exported individually or as entire libraries using standard file formats (e.g., [[tab delimited]], [[FASTA]], [[SBML]]).
* '''Combining sequences into genetic constructs''': The purpose of this group of features is to streamline the process of combining genetic parts into designs compliant with a specific design strategy.
** ''Point-and-click design tool'': This [[Wizard (software)|wizard]] guides the user through a series of design decisions that determine the design structure and the selection of parts included in the design.
** ''Design management'': Designs can be saved in the user [[workspace]]. Design statuses are regularly updated to warn users of the consequences of editing parts on previously saved designs.
** ''Exporting designs'': Designs can be exported using standard file formats (e.g., [[GenBank]], [[tab delimited]], [[FASTA]]).
** ''Design safety'': Designs are protected from some types of errors by forcing the user to follow the appropriate design strategy. 
** ''Simulation'': Sequences designed in GenoCAD can be simulated to display chemical production in the resulting cell.&lt;ref name="Cai"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cai | first1 = Y. | last2 = Lux | first2 = M.

* '''User workspace''': Users can personalize their [[workspace]] by adding parts to the GenoCAD database, creating specialized libraries corresponding to specific design projects, and saving designs at different stages of development.

==Theoretical foundation==
GenoCAD is rooted in the theory of [[formal languages]]; in particular, the design rules describing how to combine different kinds of parts and form [[context-free grammar]]s.
&lt;ref name="orig"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

A context free grammar can be defined by its terminals, variables, start variable and substitution rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sipser|first=Michael|title=Introduction to the Theory of Computation, Third edition|year=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Boston, MA, USA|isbn=978-1-133-18779-0|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In GenoCAD, the terminals of the grammar are sequences of [[DNA]] that perform a particular biological purpose (e.g. a [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]]). The variables are less homogeneous: they can represent longer sequences that have multiple functions or can represent a section of DNA that can contain one of multiple different sequences of DNA but perform the same function (e.g. a variable represents the set of promoters). GenoCAD includes built in substitution rules to ensure that the DNA sequence is biologically viable. Users can also define their own sets of rules for other purposes.

Designing a sequence of DNA in GenoCAD is much like creating a derivation in a context free grammar. The user starts with the start variable and repeatedly selects a variable and a substitution for it until only terminals are left.&lt;ref name="orig"/&gt;

'''Gilbert Ryle''' (19 August 1900 – 6 October 1976) was a British philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gilbert-Ryle|title=Gilbert Ryle {{!}} British philosopher|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-09-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a representative of the generation of British [[ordinary language philosophy|ordinary language philosopher]]s who shared [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]]'s approach to philosophical problems,&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Grayling]] (''Wittgenstein,'' Oxford University Press, (Oxford), 1988, p.114) is certain that, despite the fact that Wittgenstein's work ''might'' have possibly played some "''second or third-hand [part in the promotion of] the philosophical concern for language which was dominant in the mid-century''", ''neither'' Gilbert Ryle ''nor'' any of those in the so-called "[[Ordinary language philosophy]]" school that is chiefly associated with [[J. L. Austin]] (and, according to Grayling, [[G. E. Moore]], [[C. D. Broad]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[A. J. Ayer]]) were Wittgensteinians. Grayling asserts that "''most of them were largely unaffected by Wittgenstein's later ideas, and some were actively hostile to them''"&lt;/ref&gt; and is principally known for his critique of [[Cartesian dualism]], for which he coined the phrase "the [[ghost in the machine]]." Some of his ideas in the philosophy of mind have been referred to as "behaviourist." Ryle's best known book is ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949), in which he writes that the "general trend of this book will undoubtedly, and harmlessly, be stigmatised as 'behaviourist'."&lt;ref&gt;Ryle, Gilbert.''The Concept of Mind''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2002. Pp. 327.&lt;/ref&gt; Ryle, having engaged in detailed study of the key works of [[Bernard Bolzano]], [[Franz Brentano]], [[Alexius Meinong]], [[Edmund Husserl]], and [[Martin Heidegger]], himself suggested instead that the book "could be described as a sustained essay in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], if you are at home with that label."&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Ryle, "Phenomenology versus ''The Concept of Mind''," in ''Collected Papers'', London: Hutchinson, 1971, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Ryle was born in [[Brighton]], England, in 1900, and grew up in an environment of learning. His father was a Brighton doctor, a generalist who had interests in philosophy and [[astronomy]], and passed on to his children an impressive library. Ryle was educated at [[Brighton College]], and in 1919 he went up to [[The Queen's College, Oxford|The Queen's College]] at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] to study [[Classics]] but was quickly drawn to Philosophy. He graduated with a "triple first": first-class honours in classical honour moderations (1921), ''literae humaniores'' (1923), and politics, philosophy, and economics (1924), and was appointed as lecturer in philosophy at [[Christ Church, Oxford]] in 1925. A year later, he became a Student ([[Fellow]]) and tutor at Christ Church, where he remained until 1940.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| last = Tanney | first = Julia | title = Gilbert Ryle | encyclopedia = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | publisher = The Metaphysics Research Lab | location = Stanford, CA | date = Winter 2003 | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ryle/ | accessdate = 5 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In World War II he was commissioned in the Welsh Guards. A capable linguist, he was recruited into [[military intelligence|intelligence]] work and by the end of the war had been promoted to the rank of Major. After the war he returned to Oxford and was elected [[Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy]] and Fellow of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]. He published his principal work, ''The Concept of Mind'' in 1949. He was President of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1945 to 1946, and editor of the philosophical journal ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'' from 1947 to 1971. Ryle died on 6 October 1976 at [[Whitby]], North Yorkshire.&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia" /&gt;

His brothers [[John Alfred Ryle|John Alfred]] (1889–1950) and George Bodley (1902–1978), both educated at [[Brighton College]] as well, also had eminent careers. John became [[Regius Professor of Physic (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Physic]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] 1935–45 and physician to King George V. George, after serving as Director of Forestry first for Wales and then England, was Deputy-Director of the [[Forestry Commission]] 1963–65 and appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]].

==Work==
===''The Concept of Mind''===
{{Main|The Concept of Mind}}

In ''The Concept of Mind'', Ryle argues that dualism involves [[category mistake]]s and philosophical [[nonsense]]. Category mistakes and nonsense as philosophical topics continued to inform Ryle's work. Students in his 1967-8 Oxford audience would be asked rhetorically what was wrong with saying that there are three things in a field: two cows and a pair of cows. They were also invited to ponder whether the bung-hole of a beer barrel is part of the barrel or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-philosophy.com/ryle-concept-mind-summary|title=Ryle: The concept of mind (Summary)|website=www.the-philosophy.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy as cartography===
{{cquote|The philosophical arguments which constitute this book are intended not to increase what we know about minds but to rectify the logical geography of the knowledge we already possess.&lt;ref&gt;Concept of Mind p 1&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Ryle thought it was no longer possible to believe that it was a philosopher's task to study mental as opposed to physical objects. However, in its place, Ryle saw the tendency of philosophers to search for objects whose nature was neither physical nor mental. Ryle believed, instead, that "philosophical problems are problems of a certain sort; they are not problems of an ordinary sort about special entities."&lt;ref name="Stanford Encyclopedia" /&gt;

Ryle offers the analogy of philosophy as being like [[cartography]]. Competent speakers of a language, Ryle believes, are to a philosopher what ordinary villagers are to a mapmaker. The ordinary villager has a competent grasp of his village, and is familiar with its inhabitants and [[geography]]. However, when asked to interpret a map for the same knowledge he has practically, the villager will have difficulty until he is able to translate his practical knowledge into universal cartographal terms. The villager thinks of the village in personal and practical terms, while the mapmaker thinks of the village in neutral, public, cartographical terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

By "mapping" the words and phrases of a particular statement, philosophers are able to generate what Ryle calls "implication threads." In other words, each word or phrase of a statement contributes to the statement in that, if the words or phrases were changed, the statement would have a different implication. The philosopher must show the directions and limits of different implication threads that a "concept contributes to the statements in which it occurs." To show this, he must be "tugging" at neighbouring threads, which, in turn, must also be "tugging." Philosophy, then, searches for the meaning of these implication threads in the statements in which they are used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Knowing-how and knowing-that===
{{main|Descriptive knowledge|Procedural knowledge}}
A distinction deployed in ''The Concept of Mind'', between knowing-how and knowing-that (e.g., knowing how to tie a reef knot and knowing that Queen Victoria died in 1901), has attracted independent interest.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jason Stanley]] and [[Timothy Williamson]], "Knowing How", ''[[Journal of Philosophy]]'', '''98'''(8): 411–444, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction is also the origin of [[Procedural memory|procedural]] (knowing-how) and [[Declarative memory|declarative]] (knowing-that) models of [[Long-term memory|long term memory]].

Ryle took a narrow view of the scope of his field. For him, philosophy did not extend beyond the philosophy of mind, philosophical logic, and the philosophy of language. Ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics were 'philosophy' only by a strained courtesy and a burdensome historical tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_ryle.html|title=Gilbert Ryle &gt; By Individual Philosopher &gt; Philosophy|website=www.philosophybasics.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' was recognised on its appearance as an important contribution to philosophical psychology, and an important work in the [[ordinary language philosophy]] movement. However, in the 1960s and 1970s the rising influence of the [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] theories of [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Herbert A. Simon]], [[Jerry Fodor]] and others in the neo-Cartesian school became predominant. Chomsky even wrote a book entitled ''[[Cartesian Linguistics]]''. The two major post-War schools in the [[philosophy of mind]], the [[representationalism]] of [[Jerry Fodor]] and the [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] of [[Wilfrid Sellars]], posited precisely the 'internal' cognitive states that Ryle had argued against. However, as influential modern philosopher and former student [[Daniel Dennett]] has pointed out, recent trends in [[psychology]] such as [[embodied cognition]], [[discursive psychology]], [[situated cognition]] and others in the [[post-cognitivist]] tradition have provoked a renewed interest in Ryle's work. Dennett has provided a sympathetic foreword to the 2000 edition of ''The Concept of Mind''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Richard Webster (British author)|Richard Webster]] endorsed Ryle's arguments against mentalist philosophies, suggesting that they implied that "theories of human nature which repudiate the evidence of behaviour and refer solely or primarily to invisible mental events will never in themselves be able to unlock the most significant mysteries of human nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Webster, Richard |title=Why Freud Was Wrong: Sin, Science and Psychoanalysis |publisher=The Orwell Press |location=Oxford |year=2005 |pages=vii, 483 |isbn=0951592254 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Redirect|high-level||High level (disambiguation){{!}}High level}}
'''High-level''' and '''low-level''', as technical terms, are used to classify, describe and point to specific [[Objective (goal)|goal]]s of a systematic operation; and are applied in a wide range of contexts, such as, for instance, in domains as widely varied as [[computer science]] and [[business administration]].

'''High-level''' describe those operations that are more [[abstraction|abstract]] in nature; wherein the overall goals and systemic features are typically more concerned with the wider, macro system as a whole.

'''Low-level''' describes more specific individual components of a systematic operation, focusing on the details of rudimentary micro functions rather than macro, complex processes. Low-level classification is typically more concerned with individual components within the system and how they operate.

Features which emerge only at a high level of description are known as [[epiphenomenon|epiphenomena]].

==Differences and similarities==
Due to the nature of [[complex systems]], the high-level description will often be completely different from the low level one; and, therefore, the (different) descriptions that each deliver are consequent upon the level at which each (differently) direct their study. For example,
* there are features of an [[ant colony]] that are not features of any individual [[ant]];
* there are features of the human [[mind]] that are not known to be descriptive of individual [[neuron]]s in the [[brain]];
* there are features of [[ocean]]s which are not features of any individual [[water molecule]]; and
* there are features of a human [[personality]] that are not features of any [[cell (biology)|cell]] in a body.

==Uses==
* In computer science, software are typically divided into two types: '''high-level''' end-user applications software (such as word processors, databases, video games, etc.), and '''low-level''' systems software (such as operation systems, hardware drivers, etc.).&lt;br&gt;As such, '''high-level''' applications typically rely on '''low-level''' applications to function.&lt;br&gt;In terms of programming, a [[high-level programming language]] is one which has a relatively high level of abstraction, and manipulates conceptual functions in a structured manner.&lt;br&gt;A [[low-level programming language]] is one like [[assembly language]] that contains rudimentary [[microprocessor]] commands.
* In [[formal methods]], a high-level [[formal specification]] can be related to a low-level executable [[implementation]] (e.g., formally by [[mathematical proof]] using [[formal verification]] techniques).
* In [[sociology]] and [[social anthropology]], high-level descriptions would be terms like [[economy]] and [[politics|political structure]], and low level descriptions would be individual peoples' motivations and work.
* In neuroscience, low-level would relate to the functioning of a cell (or part of a cell, or molecule) and high level to the overall function or activity of a neural system.
* In documentation, a [[high-level document]] contains the [[executive summary]], the [[low-level document]]s the technical specifications.
* In business, [[corporate strategy]] is a high-level description, a list of who does what jobs is a low level description.

==Examples==
* ''[[Climate]]'' is a high-level description of the actions of the [[atmosphere]] and [[ocean]]s. [[Physics]] of [[water]] and [[gas]] molecules is a low-level description of the same system.
* The instruction "write a creative poem on love" is a high-level instruction. The instruction "tighten the [[tendon]]s in the [[Handedness|dominant]] [[wrist]] to grip the [[pen]]" is a low-level description of an activity within that.
* ''"Wikipedia is an encyclopedia"'' is a high-level description compared to ''"Wikipedia is a collection of textual articles on many topics"''. The former reflects a higher level view of organization, purpose, concept and structure, but does not explain what Wikipedia physically ''is''. The latter is more detailed as to what exactly Wikipedia contains and how it's made up, but doesn't explain what its overall purpose and goals are. These are typical features of high-level and low-level descriptions.

'''Institute of Food Science &amp; Technology''' is an independent qualifying body for food professionals based in the UK and is concerned with all aspects of food science and technology.

The IFST was established to advance food science and technology, to advance education in the area and to make progress in applying principles of food science for the benefit, safety and health of the public. It serves the public by taking into account the many elements that are important for the efficient and responsible supply, manufacture and distribution of safe, wholesome, nutritious, and affordable foods with due regard for the environment, animal welfare and the rights of consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jon Poole, Chief Executive of the Institute of Food Science &amp; Technology|url=http://www.research-europe.com/index.php/2011/08/jon-poole-chief-executive-of-institute-of-food-science-technology/|publisher=Research Media Ltd|author=Tom Spencer|date=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins===
In the 1950s, food science and technology became a subject in its own right. The UK National College of Food Technology was established in 1955 and food science degree courses began to be taught in four UK universities and one polytechnic. By the 1960s, food science and technology graduates and other scientists who were working with food felt the need for an institution that recognised the new discipline of food science and technology. The IFST was formed in 1964 to cater for this new breed of scientists and work began rapidly on creating and developing the new organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blanchfield|first=Ralph|title=My 62 years in food science and technology: some reflections|url=http://www.jralphb.co.uk/62%20years%20in%20fst.pdf|work=International Review of Food Science and Technology 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1968, the Institute became an incorporated body, with a Memorandum and Articles of Association and Bye-Laws.

===Development===
During the 1970s, IFST further development its range of professional activities. In 1980, IFST became a full member of the Council of Science and Technology Institutes (the predecessor to the [[Science Council]]).&lt;ref name="IFST History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Institute of Food Science and Technology|url=http://www.ifst.org/about_ifst/history/|publisher=IFST}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the following decade, IFST focused on its public benefit role, in particular, the initiative to form the [[European Federation of Food Science and Technology]] (EFFoST), and the further development of its scientific publications.

===Into the 21st century===
In November 2007, the Charity Commission granted charitable status to the IFST company. IFST is a member-based organisation governed by a Board of Trustees, who are elected by the members. The Board is assisted by a Finance Committee and a small Executive Team. There are six standing committees, each of which deals with a particular aspect of the Institute and advises the Board on relevant topics.&lt;ref name="IFST Organisational Structure"&gt;{{cite web|title=IFST Organisational Structure|url=http://www.ifst.org/documents/misc/organogram%20governance%20structure%20070411.pdf|publisher=IFST}}&lt;/ref&gt; These committees are made up of IFST members and chaired by a member of the Board, all volunteer based. The IFST member base represents the largest food science and technology community in Europe. IFST is the only qualifying body in the UK dedicated to food science and technology.

==IFST's activities==
The IFST aims to serve the public with competence and integrity.  The IFST lists its aims as:
# Benefiting the public supply of safe, wholesome, nutritious, tasty and attractive food through the application of sound science and technology;
# Improving public knowledge and awareness of important issues relating to the supply, production, safety and quality of food ;
# Developing and communicating the knowledge underlying food science and technology, and furthering the education of food scientists and technologists;
# Safeguarding the public by defining, promoting and upholding professional standards of competence, integrity and ethical behaviour; and
# Maintaining these standards by encouraging members to continue their professional education and development throughout their careers.

As an independent body, the IFST claims it can take an independent and objective evidence-based position on all matters relevant to food science, food technology and food professionalism.

The IFST retains strong links with the US-based [[Institute of Food Technologists]] (IFT) and with the [[International Union of Food Science and Technology]] (IUFoST).

===Events===
IFST hold a number of regional and national events in the UK, some of which are organised by IFST's regional branches or professional groups. The majority of these events are open to the public. IFST hold a number of conferences including the IFST Annual Spring Conference and AGM, The Changing Face of Auditing (organised by the IFST Western branch), and the IFST Professional Food Sensory Group (PFSG) Annual Conference. They also organise lectures, discussions, and various other events. On a regional level, many branches organise food-themed outings to breweries, factories, orchards and related places.

===Careers===
IFST does a great deal to promote careers within food science and technology to young people. IFST, in partnership with the [[Food and drink federation]] (FDF) and The National Skills Academy for Food and Drink, have launched Taste Success, a campaign dedicated to demonstrating the vast opportunities within food science and technology, particularly the food and drink manufacturing sector.

IFST's Learning Zone&lt;ref name="Learning Zone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning Zone|url=http://www.ifst.org/learninghome/|publisher=IFST}}&lt;/ref&gt; has a great deal of information about careers in food science and technology including a list of UK universities offering food science and technology related courses (from foundation level to postgraduate) and testimonials from IFST members about their careers. IFST have also designed a ''Graduate Guide to Food Science and Technology'' which is available in print or online.&lt;ref name="Graduate Guide to Food Science and Technology"&gt;{{cite web|title=IFST Graduate Guide to Food Science and Technology|url=http://www.excelpublishing.co.uk/IFST/|publisher=Excel Publishing Company on behalf of IFST}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, IFST, in partnership with Camden BRI, held the first of their annual Student Career LaunchPad event, supporting university students from across the UK. The event included a series of sessions aimed to enhance the students' understanding of the food science industry, opportunities to network with food professionals and a student competition sponsored by Heinz.
IFST offers a number of prizes and awards for students studying food science and technology.

[[File:Mangroves in Kannur, India.jpg|thumbnail|Mangroves in [[Kannur]], India.]]

A '''mangrove swamp''' was a distinct saline [[woodland]] or [[shrubland]] habitat formed by [[mangrove]] trees. They are characterized by [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional]] coastal environments, where fine sediments (often with high organic content) collect in areas protected from high-energy wave action. The saline conditions tolerated by various mangrove species range from [[brackish water]], through pure [[seawater]] (3 to 4%), to water concentrated by [[evaporation]] to over twice the [[salinity]] of ocean seawater (up to 9%).&lt;ref name=NHMI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhmi.org/mangroves/phy.htm |title=Morphological and Physiological Adaptations: Florida mangrove website |publisher=Nhmi.org |accessdate=2012-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204222702/http://www.nhmi.org/mangroves/phy.htm |archivedate=2012-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Birds sanctuaries==

Mangrove swamps are home and sanctuaries for thousands of [[aquatic bird]] species, including:

* [[Pulicat Lake Bird Sanctuary]]
* [[Mangalavanam Bird Sanctuary]]
* [[Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary]]
* [[Pichavaram]]
* [[Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary]]
* [[Sundarbans National Park]]

==Natural coastal protection==

Mangrove swamps protect coastal areas from erosion, storm surge (especially during [[hurricanes]]), and tsunamis.&lt;ref name="Mazda-2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mazda | first1 = Y. | last2 = Kobashi | first2 = D. | last3 = Okada | first3 = S. | year = 2005 | title = Tidal-Scale Hydrodynamics within Mangrove Swamps | url = | journal = Wetlands Ecology and Management | volume = 13 | issue = 6| pages = 647–655 | doi=10.1007/s11273-005-0613-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Danielsen"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Danielsen | first1 = F. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2005 | title = The Asian tsunami: a protective role for coastal vegetation | url = | journal = Science | volume = 310 | issue = | page = 643 | doi=10.1126/science.1118387 | pmid=16254180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mangroves' massive root systems are efficient at dissipating wave energy.&lt;ref name="Massel"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Massel | first1 = S.

The protective value of mangrove swamps is sometimes overstated. Wave energy is typically low in areas where mangroves grow,&lt;ref&gt;Baird, Andrew (26 December 2006) "False Hopes and Natural Disasters" ''New York Times'' editorial&lt;/ref&gt; so their effect on erosion can only be measured over long periods.&lt;ref name="Massel" /&gt; Their capacity to limit high-energy wave erosion is limited to events such as storm surges and tsunamis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dahdouh-Guebas | first1 = F. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2005 | title = How effective were mangroves as a defence against the recent tsunami? | url = | journal = Current Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 12| pages = 443–447 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.06.008 | pmid=15964259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erosion often occurs on the outer sides of bends in river channels that wind through mangroves, while new stands of mangroves are appearing on the inner sides where sediment is [[Accretion (geology)|accruing]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

The '''Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics''' is located in [[Tübingen]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Germany]]. It is one of 80 institutes in the [[Max Planck Society]] (Max Planck Gesellschaft).

The institute is studying signal and information processing in the brain. We know that our brain is constantly processing a vast amount of sensory and intrinsic information by which our behavior is coordinated accordingly. How the brain actually achieves these tasks is less well understood, for example, how it perceives, recognizes, and learns new objects. The scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics aim to determine which signals and processes are responsible for creating a coherent percept of our environment and for eliciting the appropriate behavior. Scientists of three departments and seven research groups are working towards answering fundamental questions about processing in the brain, using different approaches and methods.

:''This article is about the philosophical argument; for normal conditions in the sense of standards see the corresponding articles, e.g. [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure]].''

'''Normal conditions''' are a restriction on [[Philosophy|philosophical]] arguments, especially in [[epistemology]], in order to avoid objections perceived as digressive. As a reply to objections to an explanation of a [[phenomenon]], e.g. a [[hypothesis]] or a [[theory]], it is said, argument X holds [only] under normal conditions. In some cases, the concept of normal conditions tends to be rather blurred and the reply '''under normal conditions''' can tend to extend to everything that contradicts an argument. In cases, when the argument of normal conditions comes too often, according to the principle of [[Occam's Razor]] another explanation X' has to be found.

The approximation of the [[square root of 2]] is four [[sexagesimal]] figures, which is about six [[decimal]] figures. 1 + 24/60 + 51/60&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 10/60&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.41421296...&lt;ref&gt;[http://it.stlawu.edu/%7Edmelvill/mesomath/tablets/YBC7289.html Photograph, illustration, and description of the ''root(2)'' tablet from the Yale Babylonian Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Numerical analysis''' is the study of [[algorithm]]s that use numerical [[approximation]] (as opposed to general [[symbolic computation|symbolic manipulations]]) for the problems of [[mathematical analysis]] (as distinguished from [[discrete mathematics]]). Numerical analysis naturally finds application in all fields of engineering and the physical sciences, but in the 21st&amp;nbsp;century also the life sciences, social sciences, medicine, business and even the arts have adopted elements of scientific computations. As an aspect of mathematics and [[computer science]] that generates, analyzes, and implements algorithms, the growth in power and the revolution in computing has raised the use of realistic mathematical models in science and engineering, and complex numerical analysis is required to provide solutions to these more involved models of the world. [[Ordinary differential equation]]s appear in [[celestial mechanics]] (planets, stars and galaxies); [[numerical linear algebra]] is important for data analysis; [[stochastic differential equation]]s and [[Markov chain]]s are essential in simulating living cells for medicine and biology.

Before the advent of modern computers, [[numerical method]]s often depended on hand [[interpolation]] in large printed tables. Since the mid 20th century, computers calculate the required functions instead. These same interpolation formulas nevertheless continue to be used as part of the software algorithms for solving [[differential equation]]s.

One of the earliest mathematical writings is a Babylonian tablet from the [[Yale Babylonian Collection]] ([[YBC 7289]]), which gives a [[sexagesimal]] numerical approximation of the [[square root of 2]], the length of the [[diagonal]] in a [[unit square]]. Being able to compute the sides of a triangle (and hence, being able to compute [[square root]]s) is extremely important, for instance, in [[astronomy]], [[carpentry]] and [[construction]].&lt;ref&gt;The New Zealand Qualification authority specifically mentions this skill in document 13004 version 2, dated 17 October 2003 titled [http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/units/pdf/13004.pdf CARPENTRY THEORY: Demonstrate knowledge of setting out a building]&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerical analysis continues this long tradition of practical mathematical calculations. Much like the [[Babylonian mathematics|Babylonian]] approximation of the square root of 2, modern numerical analysis does not seek exact answers, because exact answers are often impossible to obtain in practice. Instead, much of numerical analysis is concerned with obtaining approximate solutions while maintaining reasonable bounds on errors.

==General introduction==
The overall goal of the field of numerical analysis is the design and analysis of techniques to give approximate but accurate solutions to hard problems, the variety of which is suggested by the following:

* Advanced numerical methods are essential in making [[numerical weather prediction]] feasible.
* Computing the trajectory of a spacecraft requires the accurate numerical solution of a system of [[ordinary differential equation]]s.
* Car companies can improve the crash safety of their vehicles by using computer simulations of car crashes. Such simulations essentially consist of solving [[partial differential equation]]s numerically.
* [[Hedge fund]]s (private investment funds) use tools from all fields of numerical analysis to attempt to calculate the value of stocks and derivatives more precisely than other market participants.
* Airlines use sophisticated optimization algorithms to decide ticket prices, airplane and crew assignments and fuel needs. Historically, such algorithms were developed within the overlapping field of [[operations research]].
* Insurance companies use numerical programs for [[Actuary|actuarial]] analysis.

The rest of this section outlines several important themes of numerical analysis.

===History===

The field of numerical analysis predates the invention of modern computers by many centuries. [[Linear interpolation]] was already in use more than 2000 years ago. Many great mathematicians of the past were preoccupied by numerical analysis, as is obvious from the names of important algorithms like [[Newton's method]], [[Lagrange polynomial|Lagrange interpolation polynomial]], [[Gaussian elimination]], or [[Euler's method]].

To facilitate computations by hand, large books were produced with formulas and tables of data such as interpolation points and function coefficients.  Using these tables, often calculated out to 16 decimal places or more for some functions, one could look up values to plug into the formulas given and achieve very good numerical estimates of some functions.  The canonical work in the field is the [[NIST]] publication edited by [[Abramowitz and Stegun]], a 1000-plus page book of a very large number of commonly used formulas and functions and their values at many points.  The function values are no longer very useful when a computer is available, but the large listing of formulas can still be very handy.

The [[mechanical calculator]] was also developed as a tool for hand computation. These calculators evolved into electronic computers in the 1940s, and it was then found that these computers were also useful for administrative purposes. But the invention of the computer also influenced the field of numerical analysis, since now longer and more complicated calculations could be done.

===Direct and iterative methods===

'''Direct vs iterative methods'''

Consider the problem of solving

:3''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 4 = 28

for the unknown quantity ''x''.

{| style="margin:auto; text-align:right"
 |+ Direct method
 |-
 |  || 3''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + 4 = 28.
 |-
 | ''Subtract 4'' || 3''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 24.
 |-
 | ''Divide by 3'' || ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = &amp;nbsp;8.
 |-
 | ''Take cube roots'' || ''x'' = &amp;nbsp;2.
 |}

For the iterative method, apply the [[bisection method]] to ''f''(''x'') = 3''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 24. The initial values are ''a'' = 0, ''b'' = 3, ''f''(''a'') = &amp;minus;24, ''f''(''b'') = 57.

{| style="margin:auto;" class="wikitable"
 |+ Iterative method
 |-
 ! ''a'' !! ''b'' !! mid !! ''f''(mid)
 |-
 | 0 || 3 || 1.5 || &amp;minus;13.875
 |-
 | 1.5 || 3 || 2.25 || 10.17...
 |-
 | 1.5 || 2.25 || 1.875 || &amp;minus;4.22...
 |-
 | 1.875 || 2.25 || 2.0625 || 2.32...
 |}

We conclude from this table that the solution is between 1.875 and 2.0625. The algorithm might return any number in that range with an error less than 0.2.

==== Discretization and numerical integration ====

[[Image:Schumacher (Ferrari) in practice at USGP 2005.jpg|right|125px]]
In a two-hour race, we have measured the speed of the car at three instants and recorded them in the following table.

{| style="margin:auto;" class="wikitable"
! Time
| 0:20 || 1:00 || 1:40
|-
! km/h
| 140  || 150  || 180
|}

A '''discretization''' would be to say that the speed of the car was constant from 0:00 to 0:40, then from 0:40 to 1:20 and finally from 1:20 to 2:00. For instance, the total distance traveled in the first 40 minutes is approximately {{math|size=100%|1=({{val|2|/|3|u=h}}&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;{{val|140|u=km/h}})&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{{val|93.3|u=km}}}}. This would allow us to estimate the total distance traveled as {{val|93.3|u=km}} + {{val|100|u=km}} + {{val|120|u=km}} = {{val|313.3|u=km}}, which is an example of '''numerical integration''' (see below) using a [[Riemann sum]], because displacement is the [[integral]] of velocity.

'''Ill-conditioned problem''': Take the function {{math|size=100%|1=''f''(''x'') = 1/(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)}}. Note that ''f''(1.1) = 10 and ''f''(1.001) = 1000: a change in ''x'' of less than 0.1 turns into a change in ''f''(''x'') of nearly 1000. Evaluating ''f''(''x'') near ''x'' = 1 is an ill-conditioned problem.

'''Well-conditioned problem''': By contrast, evaluating the same function {{math|size=100%|1=''f''(''x'') = 1/(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)}} near ''x'' = 10 is a well-conditioned problem. For instance, ''f''(10) = 1/9 ≈ 0.111 and ''f''(11) = 0.1: a modest change in ''x'' leads to a modest change in ''f''(''x'').
|}

Direct methods compute the solution to a problem in a finite number of steps. These methods would give the precise answer if they were performed in [[Computer numbering formats|infinite precision arithmetic]]. Examples include [[Gaussian elimination]], the [[QR decomposition|QR factorization]] method for solving [[system of linear equations|systems of linear equations]], and the [[simplex method]] of [[linear programming]]. In practice, [[Floating point|finite precision]] is used and the result is an approximation of the true solution (assuming [[Numerically stable|stability]]).

In contrast to direct methods, [[iterative method]]s are not expected to terminate in a finite number of steps. Starting from an initial guess, iterative methods form successive approximations that [[Limit of a sequence|converge]] to the exact solution only in the limit. A convergence test, often involving [[Residual (numerical analysis)|the residual]], is specified in order to decide when a sufficiently accurate solution has (hopefully) been found. Even using infinite precision arithmetic these methods would not reach the solution within a finite number of steps (in general). Examples include [[Newton's method]], the [[bisection method]], and [[Jacobi iteration]]. In computational matrix algebra, iterative methods are generally needed for large problems.

Iterative methods are more common than direct methods in numerical analysis. Some methods are direct in principle but are usually used as though they were not, e.g. [[GMRES]] and the [[conjugate gradient method]]. For these methods the number of steps needed to obtain the exact solution is so large that an approximation is accepted in the same manner as for an iterative method.

===Discretization===

Furthermore, continuous problems must sometimes be replaced by a discrete problem whose solution is known to approximate that of the continuous problem; this process is called ''[[discretization]]''. For example, the solution of a [[differential equation]] is a [[function (mathematics)|function]]. This function must be represented by a finite amount of data, for instance by its value at a finite number of points at its domain, even though this domain is a [[Continuum (set theory)|continuum]].

==Generation and propagation of errors==
The study of errors forms an important part of numerical analysis. There are several ways in which error can be introduced in the solution of the problem.

===Round-off===

[[Round-off error]]s arise because it is impossible to represent all [[real number]]s exactly on a machine with finite memory (which is what all practical [[digital computer]]s are).

===Truncation and discretization error===

[[Truncation error]]s are committed when an iterative method is terminated or a mathematical procedure is approximated, and the approximate solution differs from the exact solution. Similarly, discretization induces a [[discretization error]] because the solution of the discrete problem does not coincide with the solution of the continuous problem. For instance, in the iteration in the sidebar to compute the solution of &lt;math&gt;3x^3+4=28&lt;/math&gt;, after 10 or so iterations, we conclude that the root is roughly 1.99 (for example). We therefore have a truncation error of 0.01.

Once an error is generated, it will generally propagate through the calculation. For instance, we have already noted that the operation + on a calculator (or a computer) is inexact. It follows that a calculation of the type {{tmath|a+b+c+d+e}} is even more inexact.

What does it mean when we say that the truncation error is created when we approximate a mathematical procedure?  We know that to integrate a function exactly requires one to find the sum of infinite trapezoids.  But numerically one can find the sum of only finite trapezoids, and hence the approximation of the mathematical procedure.  Similarly, to differentiate a function, the differential element approaches zero but numerically we can only choose a finite value of the differential element.

===Numerical stability and well-posed problems===

[[Numerical stability]] is an important notion in numerical analysis. An algorithm is called ''numerically stable'' if an error, whatever its cause, does not grow to be much larger during the calculation. This happens if the problem is ''[[condition number|well-conditioned]]'', meaning that the solution changes by only a small amount if the problem data are changed by a small amount. To the contrary, if a problem is ''ill-conditioned'', then any small error in the data will grow to be a large error.

Both the original problem and the algorithm used to solve that problem can be ''well-conditioned'' and/or ''ill-conditioned'', and any combination is possible.

So an algorithm that solves a well-conditioned problem may be either numerically stable or numerically unstable. An art of numerical analysis is to find a stable algorithm for solving a well-posed mathematical problem. For instance, computing the square root of 2 (which is roughly 1.41421) is a well-posed problem. Many algorithms solve this problem by starting with an initial approximation ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, for instance ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.4, and then computing improved guesses ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, etc. One such method is the famous [[Babylonian method]], which is given by ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''/2 + 1/''x&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''. Another method, which we will call Method X, is given by ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;This is a [[fixed point iteration]] for the equation &lt;math&gt;x=(x^2-2)^2+x=f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, whose solutions include &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;. The iterates always move to the right since &lt;math&gt;f(x)\geq x&lt;/math&gt;. Hence &lt;math&gt;x_1=1.4&lt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; converges and &lt;math&gt;x_1=1.42&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; diverges.&lt;/ref&gt; We have calculated a few iterations of each scheme in table form below, with initial guesses ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.4 and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.42.

 | ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.42
 |-
 | ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.4142857...
 | ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.41422535...
 | ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.4016
 | ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.42026896
 |-
 | ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.414213564...
 | ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.41421356242...
 | ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.4028614...
 | ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.42056...
 |-
 |
 |
 | ...
 | ...
 |-
 |
 |
 | ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1000000&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.41421...
 | ''x''&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt; = 7280.2284...
 |}

Observe that the Babylonian method converges quickly regardless of the initial guess, whereas Method X converges extremely slowly with initial guess ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.4 and diverges for initial guess ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.42. Hence, the Babylonian method is numerically stable, while Method X is numerically unstable.
:'''Numerical stability''' is affected by the number of the significant digits the machine keeps on, if we use a machine that keeps only the four most significant decimal digits, a good example on loss of significance is given by these two equivalent functions
:&lt;math&gt; 
f(x)=x\left(\sqrt{x+1}-\sqrt{x}\right)
\text{ and } g(x)=\frac{x}{\sqrt{x+1}+\sqrt{x}}.
&lt;/math&gt;
:If we compare the results of
:: &lt;math&gt; f(500)=500 \left(\sqrt{501}-\sqrt{500} \right)=500 \left(22.38-22.36 \right)=500(0.02)=10&lt;/math&gt;
:and
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{alignat}{3}g(500)&amp;=\frac{500}{\sqrt{501}+\sqrt{500}}\\
      &amp;=\frac{500}{22.38+22.36}\\
      &amp;=\frac{500}{44.74}=11.17
\end{alignat}
&lt;/math&gt;
: by looking to the two results above, we realize that '''[[loss of significance]]''' (caused here by '''catastrophic cancelation''') has a huge effect on the results, even though both functions are equivalent, as shown below
:: &lt;math&gt; \begin{alignat}{4}
f(x)&amp;=x \left(\sqrt{x+1}-\sqrt{x} \right)\\
    &amp;=x \left(\sqrt{x+1}-\sqrt{x} \right)\frac{\sqrt{x+1}+\sqrt{x}}{\sqrt{x+1}+\sqrt{x}}\\

==Areas of study==

The field of numerical analysis includes many sub-disciplines. Some of the major ones are:

===Computing values of functions===

{| class="wikitable" style="float: right; width: 250px; clear: right; margin-left: 1em;"
 |
'''Interpolation''': We have observed the temperature to vary from 20 degrees Celsius at 1:00 to 14 degrees at 3:00. A linear interpolation of this data would conclude that it was 17 degrees at 2:00 and 18.5 degrees at 1:30pm.

'''Extrapolation''': If the [[gross domestic product]] of a country has been growing an average of 5% per year and was 100 billion dollars last year, we might extrapolate that it will be 105 billion dollars this year.

[[Image:Linear-regression.svg|right|100px|A line through 20 points]]

'''Regression''': In linear regression, given ''n'' points, we compute a line that passes as close as possible to those ''n'' points.

[[Image:LemonadeJuly2006.JPG|right|100px|How much for a glass of lemonade?]]

'''Optimization''': Say you sell lemonade at a [[lemonade stand]], and notice that at $1, you can sell 197 glasses of lemonade per day, and that for each increase of $0.01, you will sell one glass of lemonade less per day. If you could charge $1.485, you would maximize your profit, but due to the constraint of having to charge a whole cent amount, charging $1.48 or $1.49 per glass will both yield the maximum income of $220.52 per day.

[[Image:Wind-particle.png|right|Wind direction in blue, true trajectory in black, Euler method in red.]]

'''Differential equation''': If you set up 100 fans to blow air from one end of the room to the other and then you drop a feather into the wind, what happens? The feather will follow the air currents, which may be very complex. One approximation is to measure the speed at which the air is blowing near the feather every second, and advance the simulated feather as if it were moving in a straight line at that same speed for one second, before measuring the wind speed again. This is called the [[Euler method]] for solving an ordinary differential equation.

One of the simplest problems is the evaluation of a function at a given point. The most straightforward approach, of just plugging in the number in the formula is sometimes not very efficient. For polynomials, a better approach is using the [[Horner scheme]], since it reduces the necessary number of multiplications and additions. Generally, it is important to estimate and control [[round-off error]]s arising from the use of [[floating point]] arithmetic.

===Interpolation, extrapolation, and regression===

[[Interpolation]] solves the following problem: given the value of some unknown function at a number of points, what value does that function have at some other point between the given points?

[[Extrapolation]] is very similar to interpolation, except that now we want to find the value of the unknown function at a point which is outside the given points.

[[Regression analysis|Regression]] is also similar, but it takes into account that the data is imprecise. Given some points, and a measurement of the value of some function at these points (with an error), we want to determine the unknown function. The [[numerical methods for linear least squares|least squares]]-method is one popular way to achieve this.

===Solving equations and systems of equations===

Another fundamental problem is computing the solution of some given equation. Two cases are commonly distinguished, depending on whether the equation is linear or not. For instance, the equation &lt;math&gt;2x+5=3&lt;/math&gt; is linear while &lt;math&gt;2x^2+5=3&lt;/math&gt; is not.

Much effort has been put in the development of methods for solving [[systems of linear equations]]. Standard direct methods, i.e., methods that use some [[matrix decomposition]] are [[Gaussian elimination]], [[LU decomposition]], [[Cholesky decomposition]] for [[symmetric matrix|symmetric]] (or [[hermitian matrix|hermitian]]) and [[positive-definite matrix]], and [[QR decomposition]] for non-square matrices. [[Iterative method]]s such as the [[Jacobi method]], [[Gauss–Seidel method]], [[successive over-relaxation]] and [[conjugate gradient method]] are usually preferred for large systems. General iterative methods can be developed using a [[matrix splitting]].

[[Root-finding algorithm]]s are used to solve nonlinear equations (they are so named since a root of a function is an argument for which the function yields zero). If the function is [[derivative|differentiable]] and the derivative is known, then [[Newton's method]] is a popular choice. [[Linearization]] is another technique for solving nonlinear equations.

===Solving eigenvalue or singular value problems===
Several important problems can be phrased in terms of [[eigenvalue decomposition]]s or [[singular value decomposition]]s. For instance, the [[image compression|spectral image compression]] algorithm&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.redwoods.cc.ca.us/instruct/darnold/maw/single.htm The Singular Value Decomposition and Its Applications in Image Compression] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004041704/http://online.redwoods.cc.ca.us/instruct/darnold/maw/single.htm |date=4 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is based on the singular value decomposition. The corresponding tool in statistics is called [[principal component analysis]].

===Optimization===
{{Main|Mathematical optimization}}

Optimization problems ask for the point at which a given function is maximized (or minimized). Often, the point also has to satisfy some [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s.

The field of optimization is further split in several subfields, depending on the form of the objective function and the constraint. For instance, [[linear programming]] deals with the case that both the objective function and the constraints are linear. A famous method in linear programming is the [[simplex method]].

The method of [[Lagrange multipliers]] can be used to reduce optimization problems with constraints to unconstrained optimization problems.

===Evaluating integrals===
{{Main|Numerical integration}}

Numerical integration, in some instances also known as numerical [[quadrature (mathematics)|quadrature]], asks for the value of a definite [[integral]]. Popular methods use one of the [[Newton–Cotes formulas]] (like the midpoint rule or [[Simpson's rule]]) or [[Gaussian quadrature]]. These methods rely on a "divide and conquer" strategy, whereby an integral on a relatively large set is broken down into integrals on smaller sets. In higher dimensions, where these methods become prohibitively expensive in terms of computational effort, one may use [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] or [[quasi-Monte Carlo method]]s (see [[Monte Carlo integration]]), or, in modestly large dimensions, the method of [[sparse grid]]s.

===Differential equations===
{{main|Numerical ordinary differential equations|Numerical partial differential equations}}

Numerical analysis is also concerned with computing (in an approximate way) the solution of [[differential equation]]s, both ordinary differential equations and [[partial differential equation]]s.

Partial differential equations are solved by first discretizing the equation, bringing it into a finite-dimensional subspace. This can be done by a [[finite element method]], a [[finite difference]] method, or (particularly in engineering) a [[finite volume method]]. The theoretical justification of these methods often involves theorems from [[functional analysis]]. This reduces the problem to the solution of an algebraic equation.

==Software==
{{main|List of numerical analysis software|Comparison of numerical analysis software}}

Since the late twentieth century, most algorithms are implemented in a variety of programming languages. The [[Netlib]] repository contains various collections of software routines for numerical problems, mostly in [[Fortran]] and [[C (programming language)|C]]. Commercial products implementing many different numerical algorithms include the [[IMSL Numerical Libraries|IMSL]] and [[Numerical Algorithms Group|NAG]] libraries; a [[free software|free-software]] alternative is the [[GNU Scientific Library]].

There are several popular numerical computing applications such as [[MATLAB]], [[TK Solver]], [[S-PLUS]], and [[IDL (programming language)|IDL]] as well as free and open source alternatives such as [[FreeMat]], [[Scilab]], [[GNU Octave]] (similar to Matlab), and [[IT++]] (a C++ library). There are also programming languages such as [[R (programming language)|R]] (similar to S-PLUS) and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] with libraries such as [[NumPy]], [[SciPy]] and [[SymPy]]. Performance varies widely: while vector and matrix operations are usually fast, scalar loops may vary in speed by more than an order of magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciviews.org/benchmark/ Speed comparison of various number crunching packages] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061005024002/http://www.sciviews.org/benchmark/ |date=5 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificweb.com/ncrunch/ncrunch5.pdf Comparison of mathematical programs for data analysis] Stefan Steinhaus, ScientificWeb.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[computer algebra system]]s such as [[Mathematica]] also benefit from the availability of [[arbitrary precision arithmetic]] which can provide more accurate results.

Also, any [[spreadsheet]] [[software]] can be used to solve simple problems relating to numerical analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7453">'''Parallelism''' is a rhetorical device that compounds words or phrases that have equivalent meanings so as to create a definite pattern. This structure is particularly effective when "specifying or enumerating pairs or series of like things".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; A scheme of balance, parallelism represents "one of the basic principles of grammar and rhetoric".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallelism as a [[rhetorical device]] is used in many languages and cultures around the world in poetry, epics, songs, written prose and speech, from the folk level to the professional. It is very often found in Biblical poetry and in proverbs in general. 

==Examples==

The following sentences and verses possess "similarity in structure" in words and phrases:

{{quote |''She tried to make the law clear, precise and equitable.''&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;}}

In the quote above, the compounded adjectives serve as parallel elements and support the noun "law".

{{quote |''Her purpose was to impress the ignorant, to perplex the dubious, and to confound the scrupulous.''&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;}}

In the above quote, three prepositional phrases produce the parallel structure supporting the noun "purpose". Note that this rhetorical device requires that the coordinate elements agree with one another grammatically: "nouns with nouns, prepositional phrases with prepositional phrases and adverb clauses with adverb clauses."&lt;ref&gt;Corbett and Connors, 1999. p. 45-46&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the coordinate elements possess that same number of words (or in the example below, the same number of syllables) the scheme is termed [[Isocolon|isocolon]]:

{{quote |''I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,&lt;br/&gt;My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,&lt;br/&gt;My gay apparel for an almsman's gown&lt;br/&gt;My figured goblets for a dish of wood.''&lt;br/&gt;

 – [[William Shakespeare|Shakepeare]], [[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]&lt;ref&gt; Baldick,2008. p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Forms of parallelism==
Parallelisms of various sorts are the chief [[rhetoric]]al device of [[Biblical poetry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Parallelism}} [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11473a.htm Online version of article].&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Tristich]] and in multiples of [[Distich]] parallels&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11902-parallelism-in-hebrew-poetry | title=PARALLELISM IN HEBREW POETRY | publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com | accessdate=December 7, 2011 | author=Casanowicz, I. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also in the poetry of many other cultures around the world, particularly in their oral traditions.&lt;ref&gt;p. 216. James J. Fox. 1971. Semantic Parallelism in Rotinese Ritual Language. ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' Deel 127, 2de Afl., pp. 215-255.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Lowth]] coined the term ''parallelismus membrorum'' (parallelism of members, i.e. poetic lines) in his 1788 book, ''Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrew Nation''. [[Roman Jakobson]] pioneered the secular study of parallelism in poetic-linguistic traditions around the world, including his own Russian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Jakobson, Roman. 1987. "The Poetry of Grammar and the Grammar of Poetry." In Language in Literature. K. Pomorska and S. Rudy, eds. Pp. 121-144. Cambridge, MA: The Belnap Press of Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Chinese and Vietnamese classical poetry and prose have frequently made use of parallelism. Conversations between learned men in many cases involved exchanging single [[:zh:对偶|parallel couplets]] as a form of playing with words, as well as a kind of mental duel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ann Huss|first1=Ann|last2=Liu|first2=Jianmei|title=The Jin Yong Phenomenon: Chinese Martial Arts Fiction and Modern Chinese Literary History|date=2007|publisher=Cambria Press|isbn=9781934043080|page=223|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2j5o95IZZAMC&amp;pg=PA223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nguyen|first1=Tai Thu|title=The History of Buddhism in Vietnam|date=2008|publisher=CRVP|isbn=9781565180987|page=200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUN8tC0ftJcC&amp;pg=PA200}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a parallel couplet, not only must the content, the parts of speech, the mythological and historico-geographical allusions, be all separately matched and balanced, but most of the tones must also be paired reciprocally. Even tones are conjoined with inflected ones, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chinavista.com/culture/letters/poetry/home.html Chinese Poetic Literature] ChinaVista, 1996-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallelisms in artistic speech are common in some languages of Mesoamerica, such as [[Nahuatl]] (Aztec).&lt;ref&gt;William Bright. 1990. "With one lip, with two lips": Parallelism in Nahuatl. ''Language'' 66.3:437-452.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been observed in a language of Indonesia (that Fox imprecisely referred to as "Rotinese")&lt;ref name="James"&gt;James J. Fox. 1971. Semantic Parallelism in Rotinese Ritual Language. ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' Deel 127, 2de Afl., pp. 215-255.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Navajo language|Navajo]].&lt;ref&gt;Coyote Poems: Navajo Poetry, Intertextuality, and Language Choice. Anthony K. Webster. 2004. Coyote Poems: Navajo Poetry, Intertextuality, and Language Choice. ''American Indian Culture and Research Journal'' 28.4:69-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Other research has found parallelisms in the languages of the Ural-Altaic area (including Finnish-Karelian folk poetry and the epics and songs of the Turkic and Mongolian peoples) and [[Toda language|Toda]], suggesting wider distribution among Dravidian languages.&lt;ref name="James" /&gt;

== In proverbs ==
Parallelisms in [[Proverb|proverbs]] are very common in languages around the world. Parallel structures in short passages such as proverbs help direct the listener or reader to compare the parallel elements and thereby more easily deduce the point. 
*''Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.'' ([[English language|English]] proverb)
*''Wounds caused by knives will heal, wounds caused by words will not heal.'' ([[Mongolian culture|Mongolian]] proverb)
*''The truth has legs and ran away; the lie has no legs and must stay.'' ([[Yiddish culture|Yiddish]] proverb)
*''When there is food in the house, what matter if a guest arrives? When there is faith, what is death?'' ([[Afghan proverbs|Pashto proverb]])&lt;ref&gt;p. 181. Bartlotti, Leonard and Raj Wali Shah Khattak. 2006. ''Rohi Mataluna'', revised and expanded ed. Peshawar, Pakistan: Interlit and Pashto Academy, Peshawar University.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The cow which leaves first will be broken at the horn; the cow which remains in the back will be broken at the tail.'' ([[Alaba-K’abeena language|Alaaba proverb]] from Ethiopia)

The '''Price-Pottenger Nutrition Foundation (PPNF)''' is a U.S.&amp;nbsp;[[501(c)(3)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] established "to teach the public and professionals about foods, lifestyle habits, healing modalities, and environmental practices that can help people attain vibrant health."&lt;ref&gt;https://price-pottenger.org/about/ppnfs-mission&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1952, it was first known as the '''Santa Barbara Medical Research Foundation''' and later renamed the '''Weston A. Price Memorial Foundation''', in 1965, after the 20th century researcher [[Weston Price]] who emphasized the importance of nutrition for health and dentistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://price-pottenger.org/about-us|title=About Us|date=2015-10-13|work=Price Pottenger|access-date=2017-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other half of the foundation's current namesake is [[Francis M. Pottenger, Jr.]] whose [[Francis M. Pottenger, Jr.#Pottenger's cats|study of nutrition in cats]] sparked interest in a diet high in raw animal products including uncooked meats and unpasteurized dairy.  In 1969, after Price's death, the organization became the ''Price Pottenger Foundation'', and then the ''Price Pottenger Nutrition Foundation'', which it bears today.

PPNF primarily advocates: 1) that consumption of animal fats is not dangerous to human health, and 2) that mainstream agricultural methods which emphasize the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides as well as factory farming and significant processing of whole foods, reduces overall nutritional quality of food and human health.  The first set of claims go against the mainstream scientific consensus among researchers, doctors, and nutritionists, that a diet high in saturated fat presents serious risks to cardiovascular health and longevity.  The second set of claims is aligned with the increasingly popular [[organic food]] movement, although major food growers and producers consistently affirm the taste and nutritional quality of their food as identical or better than organics.

PPNF now houses over 10,000 books and publications, including the works of Dr. Royal Lee, Dr. Melvin Page, Dr. Emanuel Cheraskin, Dr. William Albrecht, and others.  The foundation today owns and protects the original copyrighted material of Weston A. Price, DDS, and Francis M. Pottenger, Jr., MD. They continue to republish Price's ''Nutrition and Physical Degeneration'', and Pottenger's ''Pottenger's Cats – A Study in Nutrition''.

==Origin==

===Weston Price===
{{Main|Weston Price}}
Price was a [[dentist]] from [[Cleveland, Ohio]], whose 1939 book, ''Nutritional and Physical Degeneration'',&lt;ref name=N&amp;PD&gt;Weston A. Price, DDS, ''Nutrition and Physical Degeneration'', 8th ed. (2008), {{ISBN|0-916764-20-6}} &amp; {{ISBN|978-0-916764-20-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the fieldwork he did in the 1920s and 1930s &lt;!-- specific dates? --&gt; among various world cultures, with the original goal of recording and studying the [[oral hygiene|dental health]] and development of pre-industrial populations including tribal Africans and Pacific islanders, Inuit, North and South American natives, and Australian aborigines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_DshCwAAQBAJ|title=100 Million Years of Food: What Our Ancestors Ate and Why It Matters Today|last=Le|first=Stephen|date=2016-02-02|publisher=Macmillan|year=|isbn=9781250050410|location=|pages=181|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book contains numerous photographs of the people he studied, and includes comparison photographs of the teeth and facial structure of people who lived on their traditional diet and people who had adopted or grown up on industrialized food. In certain instances it was possible for Price to examine and photograph traditional and industrialized eaters from the same family.&lt;ref name="N&amp;PD" /&gt;

===Francis M. Pottenger, Jr.===
{{Main|Francis M. Pottenger, Jr.}}
Pottenger was a doctor whose 1932-1942 ''Pottenger Cat Study'' addressed the nutritive value of heat-labile elements — nutrients destroyed by heat and available only in raw foods. Pottenger used donated laboratory cats to test the potency of the adrenal extract [[hormone]]s he was making. The adrenal glands of these cats were removed for the experiments and Pottenger noted that most of the cats died during or following the operation.  He was feeding the cats a supposedly nutritive diet consisting of raw milk, cod liver oil and cooked meat scraps of liver, tripe, sweetbread, brains, heart and muscle. When the number of donated cats exceeded the supply of food available, Pottenger began ordering raw meat scraps from a local meat packing plant, including organs, meat, and bone; and fed a separate group of cats from this supply.  Within months this separate group appeared in better health than the cooked meat group. Pottenger conducted subsequent studies involving approximately 900 cats over a period of ten years, with three generations of cats studied.  His experiments showed that cats were healthiest after being fed raw meat and raw dairy.

==Key individuals==

===Joseph and Pat Connolly===
Marion Patricia ("Pat") Connolly was the curator for PPNF, overseeing the archiving and promotion of the organization's materials.  Pat studied health and nutrition for over 66 years and lectured on a variety of nutritional subjects.  According to the PPNF, she was the foremost authority on the work of Price and Pottenger.  In 1962 Pat took a course on nutrition by Alfreda Rooke, then Curator of PPNF, who had studied under Price.  In 1972, she became a PPNF Nutrition Instructor and began teaching Rooke's course.   Pat Connolly taught classes educating people on Price's research and its applications.   She authored several books, including ''Dietotherapy (The Kelley Research Foundation)'', ''Mini Guide To Living Foods'', ''The Guide to Living Foods (PPNF)'', ''Food Alive (Livingston-Wheeler Medical Clinic)'', ''A Modern Approach to the Primitive Diet (Nero)'', and ''The Candida-Albicans Yeast-Free Cookbook (McGraw Hill)''.  She was also listed as a co-author of the first edition of [[Nourishing Traditions]].  She died in November 2010. 
&lt;ref name="ppnf.org2"&gt;http://ppnf.org/about/living-memorial/marion-patricia-connolly&lt;/ref&gt;

Her husband Joseph Connolly practiced dentistry in San Diego for 40 years and helped found PPNF.   He died in 1996.

===George Meinig===
In 1994 George E. Meinig published ''Root Canal Cover-up Exposed'' which resurrected Price's old studies.&lt;ref name=Baumgartner2&gt;{{Citation |vauthors=Baumgartner JC, Bakland LK, Sugita EI | year = 2002 | title = Endodontics, Chapter 3: Microbiology of endodontics and asepsis in endodontic practice | url = http://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/Dr.Hanan/BooksIngle/ch03.pdf |format=PDF| publisher  = Hamilton, Ontario: BC Becker | pages = 63–94 | accessdate = 2009-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding the book, Hasselgren in New York Academy of Dentistry's ''Annals of dentistry'' stated "[t]he focal infection theory, supported by many including Dr. Price, has been attacked, debated, accepted, criticized, agreed upon, etc. but it has not been covered up." Hasselgren noted that Meinig would sometime confuse the meanings of "infection" and "inflammation" and based all his work on Price's 1923 ''Dental Infections, Oral and Systemic'' book.&lt;ref name="Hasselgren, Gunnar 1994 pg 42"&gt;Hasselgren, Gunnar (1994) Annals of dentistry: Volumes 53-54 ''New York Academy of Dentistry'' pg 42)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hasselgren observed: "Many clinicians appear today to have lost sight of the fact that endodontical treatment shall be based on biology and not on the use of various gadgets to sweep canals. Also, one-visit treatment of necrotic, infected teeth is being advocated and practiced even if no long-term study has been performed to investigate this kind of treatment.  The work of Dr. Weston Price is therefore still to a great extent valid and important and the role of infection can not be underestimated."&lt;ref name="Hasselgren, Gunnar 1994 pg 42"/&gt; Meinig died in May 2008 at the age of 93.

==Publications and education==
The PPNF houses an archive of books related to Price and Pottenger's work as well as the works of authors in related fields.  The foundation publishes its own journal, the ''Journal of Health and Healing''.&lt;ref name=ppnf.org3&gt;http://ppnf.org/resources/journal-article-archives&lt;/ref&gt; They also sell a variety of books, DVD, and CDs, publish an online newsletter, and offer classes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3448">A '''prismatic compass''' is a [[navigation]] and [[surveying]] instrument which is extensively used to find out the [[Bearing (navigation)|bearing]] of the traversing and included angles between them, waypoints (an endpoint of the lcourse) and direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-a-prismatic-compass.htm |title=What is a prismatic Compass? |work=wiseGEEK.com | accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Compass]] surveying is a type of surveying in which the directions of surveying lines are determined with a magnetic compass, and the length of the surveying lines are measured with a tape or chain or [[laser]] [[range finder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://civilguides.com/surveyor-and-prismatic-compass/|title=What is Prismatic compass survey?|last=|first=|date=|work=CivilGuides|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=June 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compass is generally used to run a traverse line. The compass calculates bearings of lines with respect to [[magnetic north]]. The included angles can then be calculated using suitable formulas in case of clockwise and anti-clockwise traverse respectively. For each survey line in the traverse, surveyors take two bearings that is fore bearing and back bearing which should exactly differ by 180&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; if [[local attraction]] is negligible. The name ''Prismatic compass'' is given to it because it essentially consists of a prism which is used for taking observations more accurately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EM-sLyVmMwIC | title=Surveying Vol. 1 | accessdate=14 December 2014 | author=Dr. B.C Punmai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Least count==
Least count means the minimum value that an instrument can read which is 15 minutes in case of prismatic compass. It means compass can read only those observations which are multiples of 30 minutes, 5&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; 25&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;, 15&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; 55&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt;, 35&lt;sup&gt;°&lt;/sup&gt; 45&lt;sup&gt;'&lt;/sup&gt; 30&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DKQuL-uwypsC&amp;pg=PA457 | title=Surveying | accessdate=14 December 2014 | author=Cl Kochher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bearings==
The compass calculates the bearings in whole circle bearing system which determines the angle which the survey line makes with the magnetic north in the clockwise direction. The included angles can be calculated by the formulas '''F-P ±180''' in case of anti-clocwise traverse and '''P-F ±180''' in case of clockwise traverse, where 'F' is the fore bearing of forward line in the direction of survey work and 'P' is the fore bearing of previous line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DKQuL-uwypsC&amp;pg=PA457 | title=Surveying | accessdate=14 December 2014 | author=Cl Kochher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Protein combining''' (or '''protein complementing''') is a dietary theory for [[protein (nutrient)|protein]] nutrition that purports to optimize the [[biological value]] of protein intake. According to the theory, [[vegetarian]] and [[vegan]] diets may provide an insufficient amount of some [[essential amino acids]], making protein combining with multiple foods necessary to obtain a [[complete protein]]. The terms ''complete'' and ''incomplete'' are outdated in relation to plant protein. The position of the [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics]] is that protein from a variety of plant foods eaten during the course of a day supplies enough of all essential amino acids when caloric requirements are met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Melina|first=Vesanto|last2=Craig|first2=Winston|last3=Levin|first3=Susan|date=2016-12-01|title=Position of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics: Vegetarian Diets|url=http://jandonline.org/article/S2212-2672(16)31192-3/fulltext|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|language=English|volume=116|issue=12|pages=1971|doi=10.1016/j.jand.2016.09.025|issn=2212-2672|pmid=27886704|via=http://www.eatrightpro.org/~/media/eatrightpro%20files/practice/position%20and%20practice%20papers/position%20papers/vegetarian-diet.ashx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of protein combining has been discredited by major health organizations. Studies on essential amino acid contents in plant proteins has shown that vegetarians and vegans do not actually need to complement plant proteins in each meal to reach the desired level of essential amino acids as long as their diets are varied and caloric requirements are met.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=V.

==Concept==
Protein nutrition is complex because any [[proteinogenic amino acid]] may be the [[limiting factor]] in [[metabolism]]. Mixing [[livestock feed]]s can optimize for growth, or minimize cost while maintaining adequate growth. Similarly, [[human nutrition]] is subject to [[Liebig's law of the minimum]]: The lowest level of one of the essential amino acids will be the limiting factor in metabolism.
:If the content of a single indispensable amino acid in the diet is less than the individual’s requirement, then it will limit the utilization of other amino acids and thus prevent the normal rates of synthesis even when the total nitrogen intake level is adequate. Thus the "limiting amino acid" will determine the nutritional value of the total nitrogen or protein in the diet.&lt;ref&gt;Food and Nutrition Board of [[Institute of Medicine]] (2005) ''Dietary Reference Intakes for'' [http://www.nap.edu/read/10490/chapter/12 Protein and Amino Acids], page 685, from [[National Academies Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Plants are thus rated as protein sources by their limiting amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Young VR, Pellett PL | title=Plant proteins in relation to human protein and amino acid nutrition | journal=[[American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume=59 | issue=5&amp;nbsp;Suppl | year=1994 | pages=1203S–1212S | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/59/5/1203S.long | format = PDF |  id= | pmid=8172124 | doi=10.1093/ajcn/59.5.1203s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Examples of "limiting" amino acids in plant protein ===
According to WHO, human need for proteins is 0.66 g per kg of bodyweight per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Joint WHO/FAO/UNU Expert Consultation|first=|date=2007|title=Protein and amino acid requirements in human nutrition|journal=World Health Organization Technical Report Series|volume=|issue=935|pages=pag 88 – table 4|issn=0512-3054|pmid=18330140|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43411/1/WHO_TRS_935_eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So a 70&amp;nbsp;kg person has an estimated protein requirement of 46.2g (70&amp;nbsp;kg x 0,66 g/kg).

In addition, there is a specific need of essential amino acids quantities, thereby written in the table.

In the above example, the combination of both whole rice and canned chickpeas has no limiting amino acids, that means that only consuming rice and chickpeas, in these specific quantities of 306g/day and 261g/day respectively, for long periods of time, would not result in any of the essential amino acid deficiency.

As the data of the example show, all essential amino acids are found in a specific plant, however one of them may or may not be 'limiting', that is, present in quantities below the WHO daily recommendation.
For this reasons vegan and vegetarian diets need to be varied in terms of plants consumed.

==Plant protein research==
The first biochemist to enter the field was [[Karl Heinrich Ritthausen]], a student of [[Justus von Liebig]]. [[Thomas Burr Osborne (chemist)|Thomas Burr Osborne]] continued what Ritthausen started and published ''The Vegetable Proteins'' in 1909. Thus [[Yale University]] was the early center of protein nutrition, where [[William Cumming Rose]] was a student. Osborne also worked to determine the essentials, and later led the [[Biochemistry]] Department at the [[University of Chicago]].

When Ritthausen died in 1912, Osborne praised his efforts in biochemistry:
:As a result of his later work he proved that wide differences exist between different food proteins; and he was the first to direct attention to this fact, and to discuss its probable bearing on their relative value in nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Burr Osborne (chemist)|Osborne, Thomas Burr]] (1913) "In Memoriam: Heinrich Ritthausen", ''Biochemical Bulletin'' 2:338, published by the [[Columbia University]] Biochemical Association&lt;/ref&gt;

Osborne then joined forces with [[Lafayette Mendel]] at the [[Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station]] to determine the [[essential amino acid]]s.

In the 1950s and 1960s, [[Nevin S. Scrimshaw]] took this knowledge to India and Guatemala. He designed meals using local vegetables to fight against the scourge of [[kwashiorkor]]. In Guatemala he used the combination of cottonseed flour with maize, while in India he combined peanut flour with wheat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/nevin-s-scrimshaw-obituary-0211.html Scrimshaw obituary] from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularization==
In 1954, [[Adelle Davis]] published ''Let's Eat Right to Keep Fit'', which described the importance of combining "incomplete" proteins to make "complete" proteins, and advised that any incomplete proteins not complemented within one hour could not be used by the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=Adelle|title=Let's Eat Right to Keep Fit|date=1954|publisher=Harcourt, Brace|isbn=4-87187-961-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, [[Frances Moore Lappé]] published ''[[Diet for a Small Planet]]'', which explained how essential amino acids might be obtained from complementary sources in [[vegetarian nutrition]]. The book became a [[bestseller]] :
:An extension of a one-page handout that Lappé had circulated among her fellow improvisors in Berkeley, ''Diet for a Small Planet'' (1971) soon became ''the'' vegetarian text of the [[ecology movement]], selling in the next ten years almost two million copies in three editions and six languages.&lt;ref&gt;Warren Belasco (1989) ''Appetite for Change: how the counterculture took on the food industry 1966 — 1988'', page 56, [[Pantheon Books]] {{ISBN|0394543998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lappé wrote:
:Complementary protein combinations make for delicious [[recipe]]s – they are combinations that formed the basis of the world’s traditional [[cuisine]]s. We use them naturally in our cooking without even being aware of it. The three most common complementary protein combinations are:
:#Grains (rice, corn, wheat, barley, etc.) + legumes (peas, beans, lentils)
:#Grains and milk products
:#Seeds (Sesame or sunflower) +legumes&lt;ref name=FML&gt;[[Frances Moore Lappé|Lappé, Frances Moore]] (1981) ''Diet for a Small Planet'', {{ISBN|0-345-32120-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|238}}

In 1975, both [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] and [[American Journal of Nursing]] carried articles describing the principles and practice of protein combining.&lt;ref&gt;Judith S. Stern (1975) "How to stay well on a vegetarian diet and save money too!", [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] 165(2):150,1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor R. Williams (1975) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3423700 Making Vegetarian Diets Nutritious], [[American Journal of Nursing]] 75(12):2168–73 from [[JSTOR]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
For a time, 
The [[United States National Research Council|American National Research Council]] and the [[American Dietetic Association]] (ADA) cautioned vegetarians to be sure to combine their proteins.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, Donna. (2002). Vegetarianism: Movement or Moment? Philadelphia: Temple University Press. {{ISBN|1-56639-936-X}}. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the principle of protein combining was explained by J. Rigó:
:The [[biological value]] of proteins in general, hence also of grain-proteins, is fundamentally determined by the ratio between the essential amino acids to be found in [[cereal]]s and the requirement of essential amino acids of the living creature, consuming protein...the most important way of raising the biological value ... [is] given by the technique of complementing.&lt;ref&gt;Rigó, J. (1985) "Nutritional Functions of Cereals", in ''Amino Acid Composition and Biological Value of Cereal'', Radomir Lásztity &amp; Máté Hidvégi editors, [[International Association for Cereal Chemistry]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 [[PLOS ONE]]published an article investigating the specifics of protein combining for 1251 plant-based foods. The bases of reference are the amino acids indispensable to human nutrition, and the ideal proportioning of these amino acids in a meal. They explain, "complementation involves consuming two or more foods together to yield an amino acid pattern that is better than the sum of the two foods alone."&lt;ref name=FW&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Woolf | first1 = P. J. | last2 = Fu | first2 = L. L. | last3 = Basu | first3 = A. | editor1-last = Haslam | editor1-first = Niall James | title = VProtein: Identifying Optimal Amino Acid Complements from Plant-Based Foods | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0018836 | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = e18836 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21526128 | pmc =3081312 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast to pairings based on food groups, such as pairing a grain with a bean, the investigators reported that pairing by food group was not supported by their work: "Examining the top 100 pairings for each food, we found no consistent pattern of food group-food group pairings."&lt;ref name=FW/&gt;

==Criticism==

Protein combining has drawn criticism as an unnecessary complicating factor in [[nutrition]].

In 1981,    [[Frances Moore Lappé]] changed her position on protein combining from a decade prior in a revised edition of  ''[[Diet for a Small Planet]]'' in which she wrote:

:"In 1971 I stressed protein complementarity because I assumed that the only way to get enough protein ... was to create a protein as usable by the body as animal protein. In combating the myth that meat is the only way to get high-quality protein, I reinforced another myth. I gave the impression that in order to get enough protein without meat, considerable care was needed in choosing foods. Actually, it is much easier than I thought.

:"With three important exceptions, there is little danger of protein deficiency in a plant food diet. The exceptions are diets very heavily dependent on [1] [[fruit]] or on [2] some tubers, such as [[sweet potato]]es or [[cassava]], or on [3] [[junk food]] (refined flours, sugars, and fat). Fortunately, relatively few people in the world try to survive on diets in which these foods are virtually the sole source of calories. In all other diets, if people are getting enough calories, they are virtually certain of getting enough protein."&lt;ref name=FML/&gt;{{rp|162}}

Necessity of protein combining was not asserted. Rather, the increased [[biological value]] of meals where proteins are combined was noted. In a concession, Lappé removed from the second edition "charts that indicate exact proportions of complementary proteins".&lt;ref name=FML/&gt;{{rp|239}}

The American Dietetic Association reversed itself in its 1988 position paper on vegetarianism. Suzanne Havala, the primary author of the paper, recalls the research process:
:There was no basis for [protein combining] that I could see.... I began calling around and talking to people and asking them what the justification was for saying that you had to complement proteins, and there was none. And what I got instead was some interesting insight from people who were knowledgeable and actually felt that there was probably no need to complement proteins. So we went ahead and made that change in the paper.  [Note: The paper was approved by peer review and by a delegation vote before becoming official.]

In 1994, Vernon Young and Peter Pellett published their paper that became the definitive contemporary guide to protein metabolism in humans. It also confirmed that complementing proteins at meals was totally unnecessary. Thus, people who avoid consuming animal protein do not need to be at all concerned about amino acid imbalances from the plant proteins that make up their usual diets.&lt;ref name="VRYoung"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Young VR, Pellett PL | title=Plant proteins in relation to human protein and amino acid nutrition | journal=[[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]] | volume=59 | issue=5&amp;nbsp;Suppl | year=1994 | pages=1203S–1212S | url = http://www.ajcn.org/content/59/5/1203S.long| pmid=8172124 | doi=10.1093/ajcn/59.5.1203s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many plant proteins are lower in one or more essential amino acids than animal proteins, especially [[lysine]], and to a lesser extent [[methionine]] and [[threonine]], eating a variety of plants can serve as a well-balanced and complete source of amino acids.&lt;ref name="VRYoung" /&gt;

Pediatrician [[Charles R. Attwood]] wrote, "The old ideas about the necessity of carefully combining vegetables at every meal to ensure the supply of essential amino acids has been totally refuted."&lt;ref&gt;Attwood, Charles R. [http://www.vegsource.com/attwood/complete_protein.htm "Complete" Proteins?], VegSource.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[John A. McDougall|Dr. John McDougall]] wrote a correction to the American Heart Association for a 2001 publication that questioned the completeness of plant proteins, and further asserted that "it is impossible to design an amino acid–deficient diet based on the amounts of unprocessed starches and vegetables sufficient to meet the calorie needs of humans."&lt;ref name="McDougall"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDougall|first1=J|title=Plant foods have a complete amino acid composition|journal=Circulation|date=25 Jun 2002|volume=105|issue=25|page=:e197|pmid=12082008|doi=10.1161/01.CIR.0000018905.97677.1F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year, Dr. [[Andrew Weil]] wrote that "you don’t have to worry that you won’t get enough usable protein if you don’t put together some magical combination of foods at each meal."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/id/QAA142995 Vegetarians: Pondering Protein?], DrWeil.com, Dec. 11, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Healthy Times'' Jeff Novick wrote that the necessity of protein combining is a "myth that won’t go away".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diseaseproof.com/archives/diet-myths-complementary-protein-myth-wont-go-away.html Complementary Protein Myth Won't Go Away!],
Jeff Novick, M.S., R.D., ''Healthy Times'' (May 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Dr. [[Joel Fuhrman]] wrote:
:...plant foods have plenty of protein and you do not have to be a nutritional scientist or dietitian to figure out what to eat and you don’t need to mix and match foods to achieve protein completeness.  Any combination of natural foods will supply you with adequate protein, including all eight essential amino acids as well as unessential amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fuhrman|first1=Joel|title=Eat to Live|date=2005|publisher=Little Brown|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[T. Colin Campbell]] wrote in 2006:
:We now know that through enormously complex metabolic systems, the human body can derive all the essential amino acids from the natural variety of plant proteins that we encounter every day. It doesn’t require eating higher quantities of plant protein or meticulously planning every meal.&lt;ref name="ChinaStudy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=T. Colin|last2=Campbell|first2=Thomas M.|title=The China Study|date=2006|publisher=BenBella Books|isbn=1935251007|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|American Dietetic Association]] wrote: 
:Plant protein can meet protein requirements when a variety of plant foods is consumed and energy needs are met. Research indicates that an assortment of plant foods eaten over the course of a day can provide all essential amino acids and ensure adequate nitrogen retention and use in healthy adults, thus, complementary proteins do not need to be consumed at the same meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Position of the American Dietetic Association: Vegetarian Diets|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|date=July 2009|volume=109|issue=7|pages=1267–1268|url=http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/2009_ADA_position_paper.pdf|accessdate=13 January 2017|doi=10.1016/j.jada.2009.05.027|pmid=19562864 | last1 = Craig | first1 = WJ | last2 = Mangels | first2 = AR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Heart Association now states:
:You don’t need to eat foods from animals to have enough protein in your diet. Plant proteins alone can provide enough of the essential and non-essential amino acids, as long as sources of dietary protein are varied and caloric intake is high enough to meet energy needs. Whole grains, legumes, vegetables, seeds and nuts all contain both essential and non-essential amino acids. You don’t need to consciously combine these foods (“complementary proteins”) within a given meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vegetarian, Vegan Diet &amp; Heart Health|url=https://www.goredforwomen.org/live-healthy/first-steps-to-prevent-heart-disease-and-be-heart-healthy/vegetarian-vegan-diet-heart-health/|website=Go Red For Women|publisher=American Heart Association|accessdate=13 January 2017|ref=GoRed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some institutions use the [[Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score]] to assess diets without consideration of protein combining and hence find the use of combinations to be a challenge to their methodology.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16293">'''Protein quality''' is the [[Digestion#Protein digestion|digestibility]] and quantity of [[essential amino acid]]s for providing the proteins in correct ratios for human consumption. There are various methods that rank the quality of different types of [[protein]], some of which are outdated and no longer in use, or not considered as useful as they once were thought to be. The [[Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score]] (PDCAAS), which was recommended by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), became the industry standard in 1993. FAO has recently recommended the newer [[Digestible Indispensable Amino Acid Score]] (DIAAS) to supersede PDCAAS. The dairy industry is in favor of this, because while PDCAAS truncates all protein types that exceed the [[essential amino acid]] (EAA) requirements to 1.0, DIAAS allows a higher than 1.0 ranking: while for example both soy protein isolate and whey isolate are ranked 1.0 according to PDCAAS, in the DIAAS system, whey has a higher score than soy.

==PDCAAS versus DIAAS==
The main limitations of PDCAAS is that it doesn't take into account [[Antinutrient|anti-nutrient]] factors like [[phytic acid]] and [[trypsin inhibitor]]s, which limit the absorption of protein among other nutrients. For this reason, DIAAS is promoted as the superior method and preferable over the PDCAAS. Other older methods like BV, PER, NPU and [[nitrogen balance]] may not reveal much about the amino acid profile and digestibility of the protein source in question, but can still be considered useful in that they determine other aspects of protein quality not taken into account by PDCAAS and DIAAS.

==Protein ranking==
Below follows a table that compares various proteins based on their rankings. Some of these results may differ and vary significantly depending on if it is soybeans or soy protein isolate, and so on. For example, while soybeans have a PDCAAS score of 0.91, many soy protein isolates (though not all) typically get a PDCAAS score of 1.0. Likewise, the amino acid profile may differ from crop to crop depending on the soil, and between different breeds of soy. Generally speaking, however, soybeans rarely outperform whey protein isolate in PDCAAS rankings.

==Amino acid profile==
Below follows a table that compares the complete amino acid profiles of various proteins. The amino acid score is based on the prevalence of the essential amino acids and depends on if they reach sufficient quantity. PDCAAS scores do not take into account the quantity of the non-essential amino acids.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11879">'''Queer of color critique''' is a methodology that recognizes the [[Intersectionality|intersections]] of race, gender, class, sexuality, capital, and nation, and disidentifies with the universality of social categories present in canonical [[sociology]] and historical materialism. [[Roderick Ferguson]] is credited with coining this term in his 2004 book ''Aberrations in Black, ''and draws from woman of color [[feminism]], postcolonial studies, [[queer theory]] and [[African-American studies|African American studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Valles-Morales, Jesus. "On Queer of Color Criticism, Communication Studies, and Corporeality. ''Kaleidoscope: A Graduate Journal of Qualitative Communication Research ''14 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; In his critique of canonical sociology, Ferguson argues that racialized heteronormativity and heteropatriarchy has played a conspicuous role in shaping sociology and social policy, and recognizes its intersection with revolutionary nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Albertine, Susan. "Aberrations in Black: Toward a Queer of Color Critique (Book Review)." ''American Literature ''77.3 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Queer of color critique operates as a method for building unlikely coalitions across different identity categories. In framing queer of color critique, Ferguson draws from [[Barbara Smith]] and the [[Combahee River Collective|Combahee River Collective's]] use of coalitional politics to address gender, race, and sexuality in context with capitalist expansion.

== Influences  ==

Queer of color critique has been taken up by multiple scholars as an attempt at a more intersectional framework on which to build and extend their work in various, sometimes intersecting academic subjects.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz, José Esteban. Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota, 2015. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Queerness and indigeneity ===

Though most references at the intersection of queerness and indigeneity fall on [[Two-Spirit]] identity and ideas surrounding it, queer of color critique extends the discussion to settler colonialism, future potentialities of Native identity and life, and general discourse about how [[Native American studies|Native Studies]] as an academic study can benefit from a sort of "queering". According to scholar [[Andrea Smith (academic)|Andrea Smith]], looking at indigeneity from this perspective questions the limitations of a "subjectless" or "postidentity" analysis in regards to the shedding of a particular ethnic identity, which in itself has roots in colonialist and nationalist ideology. On the other hand, even this sort of critique does not fully acknowledge the extent of the absence of indigeneity in the context of direct and indirect investment in settler colonialism by those of color doing the critiquing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Smith, Andrea. "Queer Theory and Native Studies: The Heteronormativity of Settler Colonialism." GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies 16.1-2 (2010): 41-68. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morgensen, Scott Lauria. ''Spaces between Us: Queer Settler Colonialism and Indigenous Decolonization''. Minneapolis: U of Minnesota, 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== De-colonial Studies ===
The unraveling of colonialist ideology,—the belief in a normative society—according to scholar [[Emma Perez]], is necessary to fully understand national histories and identities, specifically of queer individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perez|first=Emma|date=2003|title=Queering the Borderlands: The Challenges of Excavating the Invisible and Unheard|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/50898|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=24|pages=122–131|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Queer diasporic critique ===

Queer [[Diaspora|diasporic]] critique can be considered an extension of and complement to queer of color critique in that it considers ethnic and cultural identity as an underlying context when analyzing and critiquing arguments based on [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]], white centered [[Queer theory|queer theories]], as well as critiquing the heteronormativity of [[area studies]]. Oftentimes, these ideas are connected to ideas of [[nationhood]] and national identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Puar|first=Jasbir K.|date=2008-06-01|title='the Turban Is Not a Hat': Queer Diaspora and Practices of Profiling|journal=Sikh Formations|volume=4|issue=1|pages=47–91|doi=10.1080/17448720802075439|issn=1744-8727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lesk, Andrew. "Queerly Canadian: An Introductory Reader in Sexuality Studies Ed. by Maureen FitzGerald and Scott Rayter (review)." ''University of Toronto Quarterly''. University of Toronto Press, 28 Oct. 2015. Web. 29 Apr. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of scholar [[Gayatri Gopinath]], "While both queer of color and queer diasporic analysis are part of a collective endeavor to reshape queer studies through a thorough engagement with questions of race, nationalism, and transnationalism, it may also be useful to explore some of the points at which the interventions and emphases of each project both intersect and diverge." In this respect, critique emphasizing diaspora tends to focus more on a "global restructuring of capital and its attendant gender and sexual hierarchies" and the creation of "home" in regards to diaspora and [[transnationalism]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Gopinath, Gayatri. "Bollywood Spectacles: Queer Diasporic Critique in the Aftermath of 9/11." Social Text 23.3-4 84-85 (2005): 157-69. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Queer Muslims ====

An example of queer of color critique in practice can be seen in the analysis of queer Muslims in Europe done by scholar [[Fatima El-Tayeb]], which touches on the larger themes explored in [[queer theory]]. Among these is the idea of "[[Coming out|coming-out]]" as a person of diaspora, which challenges the currently held notion of its role in the creation of a "normative, healthy and desirable LGBT identity". Another describes how the idea of [[Islamophobia]] permeates into the [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] oppressions faced by queer Muslims in the west. The ideas of migration and "home" are also critiqued in that the ethnic migrant laborer lives amongst an "increasingly segregated, criminalized and policed multi-ethnic population of color". These queer diasporic and queer of color critiques therefore act as a lens through which to view homonormativity and the various facets through which is functions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;El-Tayeb, F. "'Gays Who Cannot Properly Be Gay': Queer Muslims in the Neoliberal European City." European Journal of Women's Studies 19.1 (2012): 79-95. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Puar, Jasbir K. Terrorist Assemblages: Homonationalism in Queer times. Durham, NC: Duke UP, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a type of community manifestation of this type of critique, the queer of color activist group [[Strange Fruit: A Dutch Queer Collective]] takes an intersectional, colored approach to queer activism. This helps undermine binaries such as the "Muslim/European dichotomy to the normative coming out narrative", which, according to [[Fatima El-Tayeb|El-Tayeb]], perpetuate homonormativity and racism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Rural flight''' (or '''rural exodus''') is the [[Human migration|migratory pattern]] of peoples from [[rural sociology|rural areas]] into [[urban area]]s.  It is [[urbanization]] seen from the rural perspective.

In modern times, it often occurs in a region following the [[Factory farming|industrialization]] of [[agriculture]]—when fewer people are needed to bring the same amount of agricultural output to market—and related agricultural services and industries are consolidated.  Rural flight is exacerbated when the population decline leads to the loss of rural services (such as business enterprises and schools), which leads to greater loss of population as people leave to seek those features.

This phenomenon was first articulated through [[Christian McLean]]'s laws of migration in the 1880s, upon which modern theories &lt;!-- modern theories of what, migration? --&gt; are based.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Historical trends==
[[File:Dust Bowl - Dallas, South Dakota 1936.jpg|thumb|rt|250px|The effects of the [[Dust Bowl]] in [[Dallas, South Dakota]], May 1936]]
Prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]], rural flight occurred in mostly localized regions. Pre-industrial societies did not experience large rural-urban migration flows primarily due to the inability of cities to support large populations. Lack of large employment industries, high urban mortality, and low food supplies all served as checks keeping pre-industrial cities much smaller than their modern counterparts. [[Ancient Athens]] and Rome, scholars estimate, had peak populations of 80,000 and 500,000 paling in comparison with their current populations.&lt;ref name=Weeks&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeks|first=John|title=Population: an introduction to concepts and issues|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|pages=353–391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The onset of the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the late 19th century removed many of the checks that had previously constrained urban populations. As food supplies increased and stabilized and industrialized centers moved into place, cities began to support larger populations, sparking the beginning of rural flight on a massive scale.&lt;ref name=Weeks /&gt; The United Kingdom went from having 20% of the population living in urban areas in 1800 to more than 70% by 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Kingsley|title=The Urbanization of the Human Population|url=http://lgdata.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/3245/871552/The_Urbanization_of_the_Human_Population--Kingsley_Davis.pdf|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the late 19th century and early 20th century saw much of rural flight focused in [[Western Europe]] and the United States, as [[industrialization]] spread throughout the world during the 20th century, rural flight and [[urbanization]] followed quickly behind. Today, rural flight is an especially distinctive phenomenon in some of the newer urbanized areas including [[China]] and more recently [[sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name=Weeks /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChinaDaily&gt;{{cite web|last=Juan|first=Shan|title=Rural exodus to cities continue|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2012-08/08/content_15652220.htm|publisher=China Daily|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dust Bowl ===
The shift from mixed [[subsistence farming]] to commodity crops and livestock began in the late 19th century. New capital market systems and the railroad network began the trend towards larger farms that employed fewer people per acre. These larger farms used more efficient technologies such as steel plows, mechanical [[reaper]]s, and higher-yield seed stock, which reduced human input per unit of production.&lt;ref name="Cronon"&gt;{{cite book | last=Cronon| first=William| title=Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West| publisher=Norton| location=New York| year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other issue on the Great Plains was that people were using inappropriate farming techniques for the soil and weather conditions.  Most [[Homestead Acts|homestead]]ers had family farms generally considered too small to survive (under 320 acres), and European-American subsistence farming could not continue as it was then practiced.

During the [[Dust Bowl]] and the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, large numbers of people [[Depopulation of the Great Plains|fled rural areas of the Great Plains]] and the Midwest due to depressed commodity prices and high [[debt load]]s exacerbated by several years of drought and large [[dust storm]]s.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite book | last=Cooper| first=Michael L.| title=Dust to eat: drought and depression in the 1930s| publisher=Clarion| location=New York| year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rural flight from the Great Plains has been depicted in literature, such as [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1939), in which a family from the [[Great Plains]] migrates to [[California]] during the Dust Bowl period of the 1930s.

===Modern rural flight===
Post-World War II rural flight has been caused primarily by the spread of [[industrialized agriculture]]. Small, labor-intensive [[family farms]] have grown into, or have been replaced by, heavily mechanized and specialized industrial farms. While a small family farm typically produced a wide range of crop, garden, and animal products—all requiring substantial labor—large industrial farms typically specialize in just a few crop or livestock varieties, using large machinery and high-density livestock containment systems that require a fraction of the labor per unit produced. For example, [[Iowa State University]] reports the number of [[hog farmer]]s in Iowa dropped from 65,000 in 1980 to 10,000 in 2002, while the number of hogs per farm increased from 200 to 1,400.&lt;ref name="ISU 1"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.card.iastate.edu/iowa_ag_review/summer_03/article1.aspx| title=Living with Hogs in Rural Iowa| year=2003| work=Iowa Ag Review| publisher=[[Iowa State University]]| accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consolidation of the feed, seed, [[processed grain]], and livestock industries has meant that there are fewer small businesses in rural areas. This decrease in turn exacerbated the decreased demand for labor. Rural areas that used to be able to provide employment for all young adults willing to work in challenging conditions, increasingly provide fewer opportunities for young adults. The situation is made worse by the decrease in services such as schools, business, and cultural opportunities that accompany the decline in population, and the increasing age of the remaining population further stresses the social service system of rural areas.

===Abandonment of small towns===
The rise of corporate agricultural structures directly affects small rural communities, resulting in decreased populations, decreased incomes for some segments, increased income inequality, decreased community participation, fewer retail outlets and less retail trade, and increased environmental pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extension.iastate.edu/agdm/articles/duffy/DuffyOct97.htm "Changes in Iowa farm structure"]; University of Iowa Extension;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Determinants of rural flight ==
There are several determinants, push and pull, that contribute to rural flight: lower levels of (perceived) economic opportunity in rural communities versus urban ones, lower levels of government investment in rural communities, greater education opportunities in cities, marriages, increased social acceptance in urban areas, and higher levels of rural fertility.

=== Economic determinants ===
Some migrants choose to leave rural communities out of the desire to pursue greater economic opportunity in urban areas. Greater economic opportunities can be real or perceived. According to the [[Harris-Todaro Model]], migration to urban areas will continue as long as "expected urban real income at the margin exceeds real agricultural product" (127).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=John|title=Migration, Unemployment and Development: A Two-Sector Analysis|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1222150.files/Session%2018/harris_todaro70.pdf|publisher=American Economic Association|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, sociologist Josef Gugler points out that while individual benefits of increased wages may outweigh the costs of migration, if enough individuals follow this rationale, it can produce harmful effects such as overcrowding and unemployment on a national level.&lt;ref name=Gugler&gt;Gugler, Josef. "Overurbanization Reconsidered." ''Economic Development and Cultural Change'' 31, no. 1 (1 October 1982): 173–89.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon, when the rate of urbanization outpaces the rate of economic growth, is known as [[overurbanization]].&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;Davis, Kingsley, and Hilda Hertz Golden. "Urbanization and the Development of Pre-Industrial Areas." Economic Development and Cultural Change 3, no. 1 (October 1954): 6–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the industrialization of agriculture, mechanization has reduced the number of jobs present in rural communities. Some scholars have also attributed rural flight to the effects of globalization as the demand for increased economic competitiveness leads people to choose capital over labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perz|first=Stephen|title=The Rural Exodus in the Context of Economic Crisis, Globalization, and Reform in Brazil|journal=The International Migration Review|volume=34|issue=3|pages=842–881|jstor=2675947|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, rural fertility rates have historically been higher than urban fertility rates.&lt;ref name=Weeks /&gt; The combination of declining rural jobs and a persistently high rural fertility rate has led to rural-urban migration streams. Rural flight also contains a positive feedback loop where previous migrants from rural communities assist new migrants in adjusting to city life. Also known as [[chain migration]], migrant networks lower barriers to rural flight. For example, an overwhelming majority of rural migrants in China located jobs in urban areas through migrant networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China Human Development Report 2005: Development with Equity|publisher=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some families choose to send their children to cities as a form of investment for the future. A study conducted by Bates and Bennett (1974) concluded that rural communities in Zambia that had other viable investment opportunities, like livestock for instance, had lower rates of rural-urban migration as compared to regions without viable investment opportunities. Sending their children into cities can serve as long-term investments with the hope that their children will be able to send remittances back home after getting a job in the city.&lt;ref name=Zambia&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bates|first=Robert|title=Determinants of the Rural Exodus in Zambia|journal=Cahiers d'Études Africaines|volume=14|issue=55|pages=543–564|jstor=4391333|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are severe challenges faced by poorer people in the agriculture sector because of diminishing access to productive farmland. Foreign investors through [[Foreign direct investment|Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI) schemes have been encouraged to lease land in rural areas in [[Cambodia]] and [[Ethiopia]]. This has led to the loss of farmland, range land, woodlands and water sources from local communities. Large-scale agricultural projects funded by FDI only employed a few experts specialized in the relevant new technologies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002457/245765e.pdf|title=Learning knowledge and skills for agriculture to improve rural livelihoods|last=Robinson-Pant|first=Anna|publisher=UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100169-7|location=|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social determinants===
In other instances, rural flight may occur in response to social determinants. A study conducted in 2012 indicated that a significant proportion of rural flight in India occurred due to social factors such as migration with household, marriage, and education. Migration with households and marriage affect women in particular as most often they are the ones required to move with households and move for marriage, especially in developing regions.&lt;ref name=India&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hassan|first=Tarique|author2=Khan, Jabir |title=Determinants of Rural Out-Migration in India|journal=International Journal of Advanced Research in Management and Social Sciences|date=December 2012|volume=1|issue=12|url=https://www.academia.edu/5450848|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
Rural youth may choose to leave their rural communities as a method of transitioning into adulthood, seeking avenues to greater prosperity. With the stagnation of the rural economy and encouragement from their parents, rural youth may choose to migrate to cities out of social norms – demonstrating leadership and self-respect.&lt;ref name=Youth&gt;{{cite web|last=Min-Harris|first=C.|title=Youth migration and poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa: Empowering the Rural Youth|url=http://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/researchdigest/africa/YouthMigration.pdf|publisher=Disponible en ligne dans le site|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this societal encouragement combined with depressed rural economies, rural youth form a large proportion of the migrants moving to urban areas. In Sub-Saharan Africa, a study conducted by Touray in 2006 indicated that about 15% (26 million) of urban migrants were youth. 
	
Lastly, natural disasters can often be single-point events that lead to temporarily massive rural-urban migration flows. The 1930s Dust Bowl in the United States, for example, led to the flight of 2.5 million people from the Plains by 1940, many to the new cities in the West. It is estimated that as many as one out of every four residents in the Plains States left during the 1930s.&lt;ref name=DustBowlPBS&gt;{{cite web|title=Mass Exodus from the Plains|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/dustbowl-mass-exodus-plains/|publisher=PBS|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, drought in Syria from 2006-2011 has prompted a rural exodus to major urban centers. Massive influxes in urban areas, combined with difficult living conditions, have prompted some scholars to link the drought to the arrival of the Arab Spring in Syria.&lt;ref name=Syria&gt;{{cite news|last=Aukalh|first=R.|title=A rural exodus as drought takes hold of Syria|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/03/16/a_rural_exodus_as_drought_takes_hold_of_syria.html|accessdate=13 March 2014|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States and Canada==
{{see also|Depopulation of the Great Plains}}
The terms are used in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] to describe the flight of people from rural areas in the [[Great Plains]] and [[Midwest]] regions, and to a lesser extent rural areas of the northeast and southeast and Appalachia. It is also particularly noticeable in parts of [[Atlantic Canada]] (especially [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]), since the [[collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery|collapse of Atlantic cod fishing fields]] in 1992.

==China==
{{Main article|Migration in China}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Chinese migrant workers in a construction site.jpg|thumb|right|Migrant workers are working in a construction site.]] --&gt;
[[China]], like many other currently industrializing countries, has had a relatively late start to rural flight. Until 1983, the Chinese government, through the [[hukou system]], greatly restricted the ability of their citizens to internally migrate. Since 1983, the Chinese government has progressively lifted the restrictions on internal migration. This has led to a great increase in the number of people migrating to urban areas.&lt;ref name=Hukou&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liang|first=Zai|author2=Zhongdong Ma |title=China's floating population: new evidence from the 2000 census|journal=Population and Development Review|year=2004|volume=30|issue=3|pages=467–488|doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2004.00024.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even today, the hukou system limits the ability of rural migrants to receive full access to urban social services at the urban subsidized costs.&lt;ref name=Economist /&gt;

As with most examples of rural flight, several factors have led towards China’s massive urbanization. Income disparity, family pressure, surplus labor in rural areas due to higher average fertility rates, and improved living conditions all play a role in contributing to the flows of migrants from rural to urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Labour Migration|url=http://www.ilo.org/beijing/areas-of-work/labour-migration/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International labour organization|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately, 250 million rural migrants now live in cities with 54% of the total Chinese population living in urban areas.&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{Cite journal|title=China's cities: The Great Transition|journal=The Economist|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21599360-government-right-reform-hukou-system-it-needs-be-braver-great|accessdate=18 April 2014|date=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
===Middle ages===
Rural flight has been occurring to some degree in Germany since the 11th century. A corresponding principle of German law is ''[[Stadtluft macht frei]]'' ("city air makes you free"), in longer form ''Stadtluft macht frei nach Jahr und Tag'' ("city air makes you free after a year and a day"): by custom and, from 1231/32, by statute, a [[serf]] who had spent a year and a day in a city was free, and could not be reclaimed by their former master.

===German ''Landflucht''===
{{Main article|Landflucht}}
''[[Landflucht]]'' ("flight from the land") refers to the mass [[Human migration|migration]] of peasants into the cities that occurred in [[Germany]] (and throughout most of Europe) in the late 19th century.

In 1870 the rural population of Germany constituted 64% of the population; by 1907 it had shrunk to 33%.&lt;ref name= "Schapiro, Shotwell p. 300"&gt;SchapiroShotwell; 1922, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 alone, the Prussian provinces of [[East Prussia]], [[West Prussia]], [[Province of Posen|Posen]], [[Silesia]], and [[Pomerania]] lost about 1,600,000 people to the cities,&lt;ref name= "Kirk p. 139"&gt;Kirk1969, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; where these former agricultural workers were absorbed into the rapidly growing factory labor class;&lt;ref name= "Mises p. 8"&gt;Mises2006, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the causes of this mass-migration was the decrease in rural income compared to the rates of pay in the cities.&lt;ref name= "Shafir p. 150"&gt;Shafir 1996, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Landflucht resulted in a major transformation of the German countryside and agriculture. [[Mechanized agriculture]] and migrant workers, particularly Poles from the east (Sachsengänger), became more common. This was especially true in the [[province of Posen]] that was [[Prussian partition|gained by Prussia]] when [[partitions of Poland|Poland was partitioned]].&lt;ref name= "Shafir p. 150"/&gt; The Polish population of eastern Germany was one of the justifications for the creation of the "[[Polish corridor]]" after World War I and the absorption of the land east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] into Poland after World War II. Also, some labor-intensive enterprises were replaced by much less labor-intensive ones such as [[game preserve]]s.&lt;ref name= "Drage p. 77"&gt;Drage 1909, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Landflucht'' has negative connotations in German, as it was coined by agricultural employers, often of the German aristocracy, who were lamenting their labor shortages.&lt;ref name= "Mises p. 8"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "McLean, Kromkowski p. 56"&gt;McLean, Kromkowski 1991, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==
Rural flight and out-migration in Sweden can be traced in two distinct waves. The first, beginning in the 1850s when 82% of the Swedish population lived in rural areas, and continuing till the late 1880s, was mostly due to push factors in the countryside related to poverty, unemployment, low agricultural wages, debt peonage, semi-feudalism, and religious oppression by the State church. Most of the migration was ad-hoc and directed towards emigration to the three big cities of Sweden, America, Denmark, or Germany. Many of these first emigrants were unskilled, barely literate laborers who sought farm work or daily wage labour in the cities.

The second wave started from the late 1890s and reached its peak between 1922 and 1967, with the highest rates of rural flight occurring in the 1920s and the 1950s. This was mostly "pull factors" due to the economic boom and industrial prosperity in Sweden wherein the massive economic expansion and wage increases in the urban areas pulled young people to migrate for work and at the same time drove down work opportunities in the countryside. Between 1925 and 1965, Sweden's GDP per capita increased from USD 850 to USD 6200. Simultaneously, the percentage of the population living in rural areas decreased drastically from 54% in 1925 to 21% in 1965.

== Russia and the former Soviet states ==
Rural flight began later for [[Russia]] and the former states of the [[USSR]] than in [[Western Europe]]. In 1926 only 18% of Russians lived in urban areas, compared to over 75% at the same time in the United Kingdom. Although the process began later, throughout World War II and the decades immediately proceeding, rural flight proceeded at a rapid pace. By 1965, 53% of Russians lived in urban areas.&lt;ref name=Wadekin&gt;{{cite journal|last= Wadekin|first= Karl-Eugen|title= Internal Migration and the Flight from the Land in USSR|journal= Soviet Studies|date= October 1966|volume= 18|issue= 2|pages= 131–152|jstor= 149517|doi= 10.1080/09668136608410523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics compiled by M. Ya Sonin, a Soviet author, in 1959, demonstrate the rapid [[urbanization]] of the [[USSR]]. Between 1939 and 1959, the rural population declined by 21.3 million, while that of urban centers increased by 39.4 million. Of this dramatic shift in population, rural flight accounts for more than 60% of the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Sonin|first= M. Ya.|title= Vosproizvodstvo rabochei sily v SSSR i balans truda|date= March 1959|page= 144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, most rural migrants tended to settle in cities and towns within their district.&lt;ref name=Wadekin /&gt;  Rural flight persisted through the majority of the 20th century. However, with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|end of the Soviet Union]], rural flight reversed as political and economic instability in the cities prompted many urban dwellers to return to rural villages.&lt;ref name=Wegren&gt;{{cite journal|last= Wegren|first= Stephen K.|title= Rural Migration and Agrarian Reform in Russia: A Research Note|journal= Europe-Asia Studies|date= July 1995|volume= 47|issue= 5|pages= 877–888|jstor= 152691|doi= 10.1080/09668139508412292|pmid= 12320195}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Novospasskoe1.jpg|thumb|The defunct church in the abandoned village Novospasskoye, [[Saratov Oblast]], Russia]]

Rural flight did not occur uniformly throughout the USSR. Western Russia and [[Ukraine]] experienced the greatest declines in rural population, 30% and 17% respectively. Conversely, peripheral regions of the USSR, like [[Central Asia]], experienced gains, contradicting the general pattern of rural-urban migration of this period. Increased diversification of crops and labor shortages were primary contributors to the gains in rural population in the periphery.&lt;ref name=Wadekin /&gt;

Rural flight in Russia and the former USSR had several major determinants. The industrialization of agriculture, which came later in Russia and the former USSR, led to declines in available rural jobs. Lower living standards and tough work also motivated some peasants to migrate to urban areas.&lt;ref name=Wadekin /&gt; In particular, the Soviet ''[[kolkhoz]]'' system (the collective farms in the Soviet Union) aided in maintaining low living standards for Soviet peasants. Beginning around 1928, the [[kolkhoz]] system replaced [[family farm]]s throughout the Soviet Union. Forced to work long hours for low pay at rates fixed by the government and often unadjusted to [[inflation]], Russian peasants experienced quite low living-conditions - especially compared to urban life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Editors of the Encyclopædia Britannica|title= kolkhoz|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/321400/kolkhoz|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate= 29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   While [[Brezhnev]]'s wage reforms in 1965 ameliorated the low wages received by peasants, rural life remained suffocating, especially for the skilled and the educated.&lt;ref name=Wegren /&gt;

Although migrants came from all segments of society, several groups were more likely to migrate than others. Like other examples of rural flight, the young were more likely than the old to migrate to the cities. Young women under 20 were the most likely segment of the population to leave rural life. This exodus of young women further exacerbated the demographic transitions occurring in rural communities as the rate of natural increase dropped precipitously over the course of the 20th century. Lastly, the skilled and educated were also likely to migrate to urban areas.&lt;ref name=Wadekin /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wegren /&gt;

== Mexico ==
Rural flight in Mexico occurred throughout the 1930s up until the present day. Like other developing nations, the beginning of industrialization in Mexico quickly accelerated the rate of rural flight.&lt;ref name=Arizpe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arizpe|first=Lourdes|title=The Rural Exodus in Mexico and Mexican Migration to the United States|journal=International Migration Review|date=Winter 1981|volume=15|issue=4|pages=626–649|jstor=2545516|doi=10.2307/2545516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, President [[Lázaro Cárdenas|Cardenas]] implemented a series of agricultural reforms that led to massive redistribution of agricultural land among the rural peasants. Some commentators have subsequently dubbed the period from 1940-1965 as the "Golden Era for Mexican Migration."&lt;ref name=Arizpe /&gt;  During this period, Mexican agriculture grew at an average rate of 5.7% outpacing the natural increase of 3% of the rural population. Concurrently, government policies favoring industrialization led to a massive increase of industrial jobs in the cities. Statistics compiled in [[Mexico City]] demonstrate this trend with over 1.8 million jobs created over the course of the 1940s, 50s, and 60s.&lt;ref name=Arizpe /&gt; Young people with schooling were the segment of population most likely to migrate away from rural life to urban life, attracted by the promise of many jobs and a more modern lifestyle as compared to the conservative conditions in rural villages. Additionally, due to the large demand for new workers, many of these jobs had low entrance requirements that also provided on-site job training opening the avenue for [[human migration|migration]] to many rural residents. From 1940 to about 1965, rural flight occurred in a slow, yet steady pace with both agriculture and industry growing concurrently.&lt;ref name=Arizpe /&gt;

However, as government policies increasingly favored industry over agriculture, rural conditions began to deteriorate. In 1957, the Mexican government began to regulate the price of maize through massive imports in order to keep low urban food costs.&lt;ref name=Arizpe /&gt;  This regulation severely undercut the market price of [[maize]] lowering the profit margins of small farmers. At the same time, the [[Green Revolution]] had entered into Mexican agriculture. Inspired by the work of [[Norman Borlaug]], farmers that employed hybrid seeds and fertilizer supplements were able to double or even triple their yields per acre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thurow|first=Roger|title=Enough: Why the World's Poorest Starve in an Age of Plenty|year=2009|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York, NY|author2=Kilman, Scott }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, these products came at a relatively high cost, out of the reach of many farmers struggling after the devaluation of the price of maize. The combined effects of the maize price regulation and the Green Revolution was the consolidation of small farms into larger estates.&lt;ref name=Shaw&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=R. Paul|title=Land Tenure and the Rural Exodus in Latin America|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|date=October 1974|volume=23|issue=1|pages=123–132|jstor=1153146|doi=10.1086/450773}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1974 study conducted by Osorio concluded that in 1960, about 50.3% of the individual land plots in Mexico contained less than 5 hectares of land. In contrast, the top 0.5% of estates by land spanned 28.3% of all arable land. As many small farmers lost land, they either migrated to the cities or became migrant workers roving from large estate to large estate. Between 1950 and 1970, the proportion of migrant workers increased from 36.7% to 54% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osorio|first=S.R|title=Estructura Agrariay Desarrollo Agricola en Mexico|journal=Mexico: Fondo de Cultura Economica|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centralized pattern of industrial development and government policies overwhelmingly favoring industrialization contributed to massive rural flight in Mexico beginning in the late 1960s until the present day.&lt;ref name=Arizpe /&gt;

==Consequences of rural flight==
Rural migrants to cities face several challenges that may hinder their quality of life upon moving into urbanized areas. Many migrants do not have the education or skills to acquire decent jobs in cities and are then forced into unstable, low paying jobs. The steady stream of new rural migrants worsens underemployment and unemployment, common among rural migrants. Employers offer lower wages and poorer labor conditions to rural migrants, who must compete with each other for limited jobs, often unaware of their labor rights. Rural migrants often experience poor living conditions as well. Many cities have exploded in population; services and infrastructure, in these cities, are unable to keep up with population growth. Massive influxes in rural population can lead to severe housing shortages, inadequate water and energy supply, and general slum-like conditions throughout cities.&lt;ref name=Weeks /&gt;&lt;ref name=Youth /&gt;

Additionally, rural migrants often struggle adjusting to city life. In some instances, there are cultural differences between the rural and urban areas of a region. Lost in urban regions, it becomes difficult for them to continue holding onto their cultural traditions. Urban residents may also look down upon these newcomers to the city who are often unaware of city social norms. Both marginalized and separated from their home cultures, migrants face many social challenges when moving to cities.&lt;ref name=Youth /&gt;

Women, in particular, face a unique set of challenges. Some women undergo rural flight to escape domestic abuse or forced early marriages. Some parents choose to send women to cities to find jobs in order to send remittances back home. Once in the city, employers may attempt to take advantage of these women preying on their unfamiliarity with labor laws and social networks on which to rely. In the worst of cases, destitution may force women into prostitution, exposing them to social stigma and the risks of sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name=Youth /&gt;

A '''sand fence''' or '''sandbreak''', like a [[snow fence]], is used to force windblown, drifting [[sand]] to accumulate in a desired place. Sand fences are employed to control erosion, help [[sand dune stabilization]], keep sand off roadways, and to recruit new material in desert areas. Sand fences are also commonly employed following storm events in order to aid in the dune recovery process,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Miller|first=Deborah L.|last2=Thetford|first2=Mack|last3=Yager|first3=Lisa|date=2001-01-01|title=Evaluation of Sand Fence and Vegetation for Dune Building following Overwash by Hurricane Opal on Santa Rosa Island, Florida|journal=Journal of Coastal Research|volume=17|issue=4|pages=936–948|jstor=4300253}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in developed areas where dunes are critical for protection of property. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nordstrom|first=Karl F.|last2=Lampe|first2=Reinhard|last3=Vandemark|first3=Lisa M.|date=2000-01-01|title=Reestablishing Naturally Functioning Dunes on Developed Coasts|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002679910004|journal=Environmental Management|language=en|volume=25|issue=1|pages=37–51|doi=10.1007/s002679910004|pmid=10552101|issn=0364-152X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A typical construction is to attach a perforated [[plastic]] sheet to stakes at regular intervals, similar to construction site fencing or temporary sports field fencing. Another is a [[Cedar wood|cedar]] or other lightweight wood strip and wire fence, also attached to metal stakes.  A permanent sand fence is generally of larger wooden poles set deeply into the ground with large wooden planks running horizontally across them. 

The drifting and settling  of sand behind and in front of such a fence occurs because the wind speed on both the downwind and windward sides is less than that on the far windward side, allowing light materials such as sand to settle.&lt;ref&gt;
Campbell, E. (March 1975). Snowdrift Structures. Avalanche Protection in Switzerland (pp. 103-116). Fort Collins CO: General Technical Report RM-9, USDA-Forest Service.&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a pile both in front of and behind the sand fence causing more sand to drop out.  Conveniently the sand does not drop on the barrier itself, otherwise it would soon be buried and rendered useless.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''seed''' is an [[Plant embryogenesis|embryonic]] [[plant]] enclosed in a protective outer covering 
. The formation of the seed is part of the process of [[reproduction]] in seed plants, the [[spermatophytes]], including the [[gymnosperm]] and [[angiosperm]] plants.

Seeds are the product of the ripened [[ovule]], after [[fertilization]] by [[pollen]] and some growth within the mother plant.  The [[embryo]] is developed from the [[zygote]] and the seed coat from the integuments of the ovule.

Seeds have been an important development in the reproduction and success of gymnosperm and angiosperm plants, relative to more primitive plants such as [[fern]]s, [[moss]]es and [[marchantiophyta|liverworts]], which do not have seeds and use water-dependent means to propagate themselves.  Seed plants now dominate biological [[Ecological niche|niches]] on land, from [[forest]]s to [[grassland]]s both in hot and cold [[climates]].

The term "seed" also has a general meaning that antedates the above—anything that can be [[Sowing|sown]], e.g. "seed" [[potato]]es, "seeds" of [[maize|corn]] or [[sunflower seed|sunflower "seeds"]]. In the case of [[sunflower]] and corn "seeds", what is sown is the seed enclosed in a shell or [[husk]], whereas the potato is a [[tuber]].

Many structures commonly referred to as "seeds" are actually dry [[fruit]]s. Plants producing berries are called baccate. [[Sunflower]] seeds are sometimes sold commercially while still enclosed within the hard wall of the fruit, which must be split open to reach the seed. Different groups of plants have other modifications, the so-called [[stone fruits]] (such as the [[peach]]) have a hardened fruit layer (the endocarp) fused to and surrounding the actual seed. [[Nut (fruit)|Nuts]] are the one-seeded, hard-shelled fruit of some plants with an [[indehiscent]] seed, such as an [[acorn]] or [[hazelnut]].

== Seed production ==

Seeds are produced in several related groups of plants, and their manner of production distinguishes the [[angiosperm]]s ("enclosed seeds") from the [[gymnosperm]]s ("naked seeds").  Angiosperm seeds are produced in a hard or fleshy structure called a [[fruit]] that encloses the seeds for protection in order to secure healthy growth. Some fruits have layers of both hard and fleshy material.  In gymnosperms, no special structure develops to enclose the seeds, which begin their development "naked" on the bracts of cones. However, the seeds do become covered by the [[Conifer cone|cone]] scales as they develop in some species of [[conifer]].

Seed production in natural plant populations varies widely from year to year in response to weather variables, insects and diseases, and internal cycles within the plants themselves.  Over a 20-year period, for example, forests composed of [[loblolly pine]] and [[shortleaf pine]] produced from 0 to nearly 5 million sound pine seeds per hectare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cain M.D., Shelton M.G. | year = 2001 | title = Twenty years of natural loblolly and shortleaf pine seed production on the Crossett Experimental Forest in southeastern Arkansas | url = | journal = Southern Journal of Applied Forestry | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 40–45 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over this period, there were six bumper, five poor, and nine good seed crops, when evaluated for production of adequate [[seedling]]s for natural forest reproduction.

[[Angiosperm]] (flowering plants) seeds consist of three genetically distinct constituents: (1) the embryo formed from the zygote, (2) the endosperm, which is normally triploid, (3) the seed coat from tissue derived from the maternal tissue of the ovule. In angiosperms, the process of seed development begins with [[double fertilization]], which involves the fusion of two male gametes with the egg cell and the central cell to form the primary [[endosperm]] and the zygote.  Right after fertilization, the zygote is mostly inactive, but the primary endosperm divides rapidly to form the endosperm tissue.  This tissue becomes the food the young plant will consume until the roots have developed after [[germination]].

=== Ovule ===
{{Main|Ovule}}
[[File:Ovule-Gymno-Angio-en.svg|thumb|300px|Plant ovules: Gymnosperm ovule on left, angiosperm ovule (inside ovary) on right]]

After fertilization the [[ovules]] develop into the seeds. The ovule consists of a number of components:
* The '''funicle''' (''funiculus, funiculi'') or seed stalk which attaches the ovule to the [[placentation|placenta]] and hence ovary or fruit wall, at the '''pericarp'''.
* The '''nucellus''', the remnant of the  [[megasporangium]] and main region of the ovule where the megagametophyte develops.
* The '''micropyle''', a small pore or opening in the apex of the integument of the ovule where the pollen tube usually enters during the process of fertilization.
* The '''chalaza''', the base of the ovule opposite the micropyle, where integument and nucellus are joined together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Chapter One |author1=Galili G |author2=Kigel J |title=Seed development and germination |publisher=M. Dekker |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-8247-9229-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shape of the ovules as they develop often affects the final shape of the seeds.  Plants generally produce ovules of four shapes: the most common shape is called '''anatropous''', with a curved shape. '''Orthotropous''' ovules are straight with all the parts of the ovule lined up in a long row producing an uncurved seed. '''Campylotropous''' ovules have a curved megagametophyte often giving the seed a tight "C" shape. The last ovule shape is called '''amphitropous''', where the ovule is partly inverted and turned back 90 degrees on its stalk (the funicle or '''funiculus''').

In the majority of flowering plants, the zygote's first division is transversely oriented in regards to the long axis, and this establishes the polarity of the embryo. The upper or chalazal pole becomes the main area of growth of the embryo, while the lower or micropylar pole produces the stalk-like suspensor that attaches to the micropyle. The suspensor absorbs and manufactures nutrients from the endosperm that are used during the embryo's growth.&lt;ref&gt;Raven, Peter H., Ray Franklin Evert, and Helena Curtis. 1981. ''Biology of plants''. New York, N.Y.: Worth Publishers. page 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Embryo ===
[[File:Ginkgo embryo and gametophyte.jpg|thumb|The inside of a ''[[Ginkgo]]'' seed, showing a well-developed embryo, nutritive tissue ([[megagametophyte]]), and a bit of the surrounding seed coat]]

The main components of the embryo are:
* The '''cotyledons''', the seed leaves, attached to the embryonic axis. There may be one ([[Monocotyledons]]), or two ([[Dicotyledons]]). The cotyledons are also the source of nutrients in the non-endospermic dicotyledons, in which case they replace the endosperm, and are thick and leathery. In endospermic seeds the cotyledons are thin and papery. Dicotyledons have the point of attachment opposite one another on the axis.
* The '''epicotyl''', the  embryonic axis above the point of attachment of the cotyledon(s).
* The '''plumule''', the tip of the epicotyl, and has a feathery appearance due to the presence of young leaf primordia at the apex, and will become the shoot upon germination.
* The '''hypocotyl''', the embryonic axis below the point of attachment of the cotyledon(s), connecting the epicotyl and the radicle, being the stem-root transition zone.
* The '''radicle''', the basal tip of the hypocotyl, grows into the primary root.

Monocotyledonous plants have two additional structures in the form of sheaths. The plumule is covered with a '''coleoptile''' that forms the first leaf while the radicle is covered with a '''coleorhiza''' that connects to the primary root and [[adventitious]] roots form from the sides. Here the hypocotyl is a rudimentary axis between radicle and plumule. The seeds of corn are constructed with these structures; pericarp, scutellum (single large cotyledon) that absorbs nutrients from the endosperm, plumule, radicle, coleoptile and coleorhiza—these last two structures are sheath-like and enclose the plumule and radicle, acting as a protective covering.

=== {{anchor|Seed coat}}Seed coat ===

The maturing ovule undergoes marked changes in the integuments, generally a reduction and disorganisation but occasionally a thickening. The seed coat forms from the two integuments or outer layers of cells of the ovule, which derive from tissue from the mother plant, the inner integument forms the '''tegmen''' and the outer forms the '''testa'''.  (The seed coats of some mononocotyledon plants, such as the grasses, are not distinct structures, but are fused with the fruit wall to form a [[Fruit anatomy#Anatomy of simple fruits|pericarp]].) The testae of both monocots and dicots are often marked with patterns and textured markings, or have wings or tufts of hair. When the seed coat forms from only one layer, it is also called the testa, though not all such testae are [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] from one species to the next. The funiculus abscises (detaches at fixed point – abscission zone), the scar forming an oval depression, the '''[[Hilum (biology)|hilum]]'''. Anatropous ovules have a portion of the funiculus that is adnate (fused to the seed coat), and which forms a longitudinal ridge, or '''raphe''', just above the hilum. In bitegmic ovules (e.g. ''Gossypium'' described here) both inner and outer integuments contribute to the seed coat formation. With continuing maturation the cells enlarge in the outer integument. While the inner epidermis may remain a single layer, it may also divide to produce two to three layers and accumulates starch, and is referred to as the colourless layer. By contrast the outer epidermis becomes [[tannin|tanniferous]]. The inner integument may consist of eight to fifteen layers. (Kozlowski 1972)

As the cells enlarge, and starch is deposited in the outer layers of the pigmented zone below the outer epidermis, this zone begins to lignify, while the cells of the outer epidermis enlarge radially and their walls thicken, with nucleus and cytoplasm compressed into the outer layer. these cells which are broader on their inner surface are called '''palisade''' cells. In the inner epidermis the cells also enlarge radially with plate like thickening of the walls. The mature inner integument has a palisade layer, a pigmented zone with 15-20 layers, while the innermost layer is known as the fringe layer. (Kozlowski 1972)

=== Gymnosperms ===
{{disputed|what=section|date=October 2016}}

In gymnosperms, which do not form ovaries, the ovules and hence the seeds are exposed. This is the basis for their nomenclature – naked seeded plants. Two sperm cells transferred from the pollen do not develop the seed by double fertilization, but one sperm nucleus unites with the egg nucleus and the other sperm is not used.

== Shape and appearance ==

A large number of terms are used to describe seed shapes, many of which are largely self-explanatory such as ''Bean-shaped'' (reniform) – resembling a kidney, with lobed ends on either side of the hilum, ''Square'' or ''Oblong'' – angular with all sides more or less equal or longer than wide, ''Triangular'' – three sided, broadest below middle, ''Elliptic'' or ''Ovate'' or ''Obovate'' – rounded at both ends, or egg shaped (ovate or obovate, broader at one end), being rounded but either symmetrical about the middle or broader below the middle or broader above the middle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.anbg.gov.au/cpbr/cd-keys/peakey/key/The%20Pea%20Key/Media/Html/165_seed_shape.html|title=Seed shape|work=anbg.gov.au|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226052530/https://www.anbg.gov.au/cpbr/cd-keys/peakey/key/The%20Pea%20Key/Media/Html/165_seed_shape.html|archivedate=2014-02-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other less obvious terms include '''discoid''' (resembling a disc or plate, having both thickness and parallel faces and with a rounded margin), '''ellipsoid''', '''globose''' ([[spherical]]), or '''subglobose''' (Inflated, but less than spherical), '''lenticular''', '''oblong''', '''ovoid''', '''reniform''' and '''sectoroid'''. '''Striate''' seeds are striped with parallel, longitudinal lines or ridges. The commonest colours are brown and black, other colours are infrequent. The surface varies from highly polished to considerably roughened. The surface may have a variety of appendages (see Seed coat). A seed coat with the consistency of [[Cork (material)|cork]] is referred to as '''suberose'''. Other terms include '''crustaceous''' (hard, thin or brittle).

== Structure ==
[[File:Avocado seed diagram-en.svg|thumb|The parts of an [[avocado]] seed (a [[dicot]]), showing the seed coat and [[embryo]]]]
[[File:Budowa nasienia-dwuliscienne.png|thumb|upright|Diagram of the internal structure of a [[dicot]] seed and embryo: (a) seed coat, (b) [[endosperm]], (c) [[cotyledon]], (d) [[hypocotyl]]]]

A typical seed includes two basic parts:
# an [[embryo]];
# a seed coat.

In addition, the '''[[endosperm]]''' forms a supply of nutrients for the embryo in most monocotyledons and the endospermic dicotyledons.

=== Seed types ===

Seeds have been considered to occur in many structurally different types (Martin 1946).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.seedbiology.de/evolution2.asp |title=The Seed Biology Place |publisher=Gerhard Leubner Lab, Royal Holloway, University of London |accessdate=13 October 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924100016/http://www.seedbiology.de/evolution2.asp |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are based on a number of criteria, of which the dominant one is the embryo-to-seed size ratio. This reflects the degree to which the developing cotyledons absorb the nutrients of the endosperm, and thus obliterate it.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Six types occur amongst the monocotyledons, ten in the dicotyledons, and two in the gymnosperms (linear and spatulate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uGJL_Ys6wlQC|title=Carol C. Baskin, Jerry M. Baskin. Seeds: Ecology, Biogeography, and Evolution of Dormancy and Germination. Elsevier, 2001|isbn= 0-12-080263-5 |page=27|work=google.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; This classification is based on three characteristics: embryo morphology, amount of endosperm and the position of the embryo relative to the endosperm.

[[File:Monocot dicot seed.svg|thumb|Diagram of a generalized dicot seed (1) versus a generalized monocot seed (2). A. Seed Coat B. Cotyledon C. Hilum D. Plumule E. Radicle F. Endosperm]]

=== Embryo ===
In endospermic seeds, there are two distinct regions inside the seed coat, an upper and larger endosperm and a lower smaller embryo. The [[embryo]] is the fertilised ovule, an immature [[plant]] from which a new plant will grow under proper conditions. The embryo has one [[cotyledon]] or seed leaf in [[monocotyledon]]s, two cotyledons in almost all [[dicotyledon]]s and two or more in gymnosperms. In the fruit of [[cereal|grains]] (caryopses) the single monocotyledon is shield shaped and hence called a '''[[scutellum (botany)|scutellum]]'''. The scutellum is pressed closely against the endosperm from which it absorbs food, and passes it to the growing parts. Embryo descriptors include small, straight, bent, curved and curled.

=== Nutrient storage ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Seed layers.jpg|thumb|Layers within an endospermic maize seed]] --&gt;
Within the seed, there usually is a store of [[nutrient]]s for the [[seedling]] that will grow from the embryo.  The form of the stored nutrition varies depending on the kind of plant. In angiosperms, the stored food begins as a tissue called the [[endosperm]], which is derived from the mother plant and the pollen via [[double fertilization]]. It is usually [[triploid]], and is rich in [[Vegetable oil|oil]] or [[starch]], and [[protein]]. In gymnosperms, such as [[Pinophyta|conifers]], the food storage tissue (also called endosperm) is part of the female gametophyte, a [[haploid]] tissue. The endosperm is surrounded by the [[aleurone]] layer (peripheral endosperm), filled with proteinaceous aleurone grains.

Originally, by analogy with the animal [[ovum]], the outer nucellus layer ([[perisperm]]) was referred to as [[albumen]], and the inner endosperm layer as vitellus. Although misleading, the term began to be applied to all the nutrient matter. This terminology persists in referring to endospermic seeds as "albuminous". The nature of this material is used in both describing and classifying seeds, in addition to the embryo to endosperm size ratio. The endosperm may be considered to be farinaceous (or mealy) in which the cells are filled with [[starch]], as for instance [[cereal grains]], or not (non-farinaceous). The endosperm may also be referred to as "fleshy" or "cartilaginous" with thicker soft cells such as [[coconut]], but may also be oily as in ''[[Ricinus]]'' (castor oil), ''[[Croton (plant)|Croton]]'' and [[Poppy]]. The endosperm is called "horny" when the cell walls are thicker such as [[Date palm|date]] and [[Coffee bean|coffee]], or "ruminated"  if mottled, as in [[nutmeg]], [[Palm (plant)|palms]] and [[Annonaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=waAMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopædia Britannica, 9th ed. (1888) vol. 4, |page=155|work=google.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most monocotyledons (such as [[Poaceae|grasses]] and [[Arecaceae|palms]]) and some ('''endospermic''' or '''albuminous''') dicotyledons (such as [[castor bean]]s) the embryo is embedded in the endosperm (and nucellus), which the seedling will use upon [[germination]]. In the '''non-endospermic''' dicotyledons the endosperm is absorbed by the embryo as the latter grows within the developing seed, and the cotyledons of the embryo become filled with stored food. At maturity, seeds of these species have no endosperm and are also referred to as '''exalbuminous''' seeds. The exalbuminous seeds include the [[legumes]] (such as [[bean]]s and [[pea]]s), trees such as the [[oak]] and [[walnut]], vegetables such as [[Squash (vegetable)|squash]] and [[radish]], and [[sunflower]]s. According to Bewley and Black (1978), Brazil nut storage is in hypocotyl, this place of storage is uncommon among seeds.&lt;ref&gt;Bewley &amp; Black (1978) Physiology and Biochemistry of Seeds in Relation to Germination, pag.11&lt;/ref&gt; All gymnosperm seeds are albuminous.

=== Seed coat ===
The seed coat develops from the maternal tissue, the [[integument]]s, originally surrounding the ovule. The seed coat in the mature seed can be a paper-thin layer (e.g. [[peanut]]) or something more substantial (e.g. thick and hard in [[honey locust]] and [[coconut]]), or fleshy as in the [[sarcotesta]] of [[pomegranate]]. The seed coat helps protect the embryo from mechanical injury, predators and drying out. Depending on its development, the seed coat is either '''bitegmic''' or '''unitegmic'''. Bitegmic seeds form a testa from the outer integument and a tegmen from the inner integument while unitegmic seeds have only one integument. Usually parts of the testa or tegmen form a hard protective mechanical layer. The mechanical layer may prevent water penetration and germination. Amongst the barriers may be the presence of [[lignified]] [[sclereids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://5e.plantphys.net/article.php?ch=23&amp;id=8&amp;search=seed|title=Sinauer Associates, Inc., Publishers|author=|date=|website=5e.plantphys.net|accessdate=7 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20140122033254/http://5e.plantphys.net/article.php?ch=23&amp;id=8&amp;search=seed|archivedate=22 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The outer integument has a number of layers, generally between four and eight organised into three layers: (a) outer epidermis, (b) outer pigmented zone of two to five layers containing [[tannin]] and starch, and (c) inner epidermis.  The '''endotegmen''' is derived from the inner epidermis of the inner integument, the '''exotegmen''' from the outer surface of the inner integument. The '''endotesta''' is derived from the inner epidermis of the outer integument, and the outer layer of the testa from the outer surface of the outer integument is referred to as the '''exotesta'''. If the exotesta is also the mechanical layer, this is called an exotestal seed, but if the mechanical layer is the endotegmen, then the seed is endotestal. The exotesta may consist of one or more rows of cells that are elongated and pallisade like (e.g. [[Fabaceae]]), hence 'palisade exotesta'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gramene.org/db/ontology/search?id=PO:0006048|title=plant_anatomy Term "seed coat epidermis" (PO:0006048)|work=gramene.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203143705/http://archive.gramene.org/db/ontology/search?id=PO:0006048|archivedate=2014-02-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebooks.cambridge.org/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9780511801709&amp;cid=CBO9780511801709A059|title=6 – Seed and fruit – University Publishing Online – Paula J. Rudall. Anatomy of Flowering Plants: An Introduction to Structure and Development. Third edition|publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2007|isbn=978-0-521-69245-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the three basic seed parts, some seeds have an appendage, an '''[[aril]]''', a fleshy outgrowth of the funicle ([[ovule|funiculus]]), (as in [[Taxus|yew]] and [[nutmeg]]) or an oily appendage, an '''[[elaiosome]]''' (as in ''[[Corydalis]]''), or hairs (trichomes). In the latter example these hairs are the source of the textile crop [[cotton]]. Other seed appendages include the raphe (a ridge), wings, '''caruncles''' (a soft spongy outgrowth from the outer integument in the vicinity of the micropyle), spines, or tubercles.

A scar also may remain on the seed coat, called the '''[[Hilum (biology)|hilum]]''', where the seed was attached to the ovary wall by the funicle. Just below it is a small pore, representing the micropyle of the ovule.

=== Size and seed set ===
[[File:Seed variety.jpg|thumb|A collection of various vegetable and herb seeds]]
Seeds are very diverse in size. The dust-like orchid seeds are the smallest, with about one million seeds per gram; they are often embryonic seeds with immature embryos and no significant energy reserves. Orchids and a few other groups of plants are [[myco-heterotrophy|mycoheterotrophs]] which depend on [[mycorrhizal fungi]] for nutrition during germination and the early growth of the seedling.  Some terrestrial orchid seedlings, in fact, spend the first few years of their lives deriving energy from the fungi and do not produce green leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Welby R. 1993. ''Orchids of Minnesota''. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press. Page 8.&lt;/ref&gt; At over 20&amp;nbsp;kg, the largest seed is the ''[[coco de mer]]''.  Plants that produce smaller seeds can generate many more seeds per flower, while plants with larger seeds invest more resources into those seeds and normally produce fewer seeds. Small seeds are quicker to ripen and can be dispersed sooner, so fall blooming plants often have small seeds. Many annual plants produce great quantities of smaller seeds; this helps to ensure at least a few will end in a favorable place for growth.  Herbaceous perennials and woody plants often have larger seeds; they can produce seeds over many years, and larger seeds have more energy reserves for germination and seedling growth and produce larger, more established seedlings after germination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/1027t86224633171/|journal=Plant Ecology|volume=194|issue=2|pages=149–156|author=Igor Kosinki|title=Long-term variability in seed size and seedling establishment of ''Maianthemum bifolium''|doi=10.1007/s11258-007-9281-1|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shannon DA |author2=Isaac L |author3=Brockman FE |title=Assessment of hedgerow species for seed size, stand establishment and seedling height |journal=Agroforestry Systems |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=95–110 |date=February 1996 |doi=10.1007/BF02345331 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n537375121383705/?p=6bf47ea68f7f4a8fba3999fcf9da716e&amp;pi=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functions ==
Seeds serve several functions for the plants that produce them.  Key among these functions are nourishment of the [[embryo]], [[biological dispersal|dispersal]] to a new location, and [[dormancy]] during unfavorable conditions.  Seeds fundamentally are means of reproduction, and most seeds are the product of [[sexual reproduction]] which produces a remixing of genetic material and [[phenotype]] variability on which [[natural selection]] acts.

=== Embryo nourishment ===
Seeds protect and nourish the embryo or young plant. They usually give a seedling a faster start than a sporeling from a spore, because of the larger food reserves in the seed and the multicellularity of the enclosed embryo.

=== Dispersal ===
{{Main|Seed dispersal}}
Unlike animals, plants are limited in their ability to seek out favorable conditions for life and growth. As a result, plants have evolved many ways to [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] their offspring by dispersing their seeds (see also [[vegetative reproduction]]). A seed must somehow "arrive" at a location and be there at a time favorable for germination and growth. When the fruits open and release their seeds in a regular way, it is called [[dehiscence (botany)|dehiscent]], which is often distinctive for related groups of plants; these fruits include capsules, follicles, legumes, silicles and siliques.  When fruits do not open and release their seeds in a regular fashion, they are called indehiscent, which include the fruits achenes, caryopsis, nuts, samaras, and utricles.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Samuel B., and Arlene E. Luchsinger. 1979. ''Plant systematics. McGraw-Hill series in organismic biology''. New York: McGraw-Hill.  Page 195.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== By wind (anemochory) ====
[[File:Taraxacum sect. Ruderalia MHNT.jpg|thumb|Dandelion seeds are contained within [[achene]]s, which can be carried long distances by the wind.]]
[[File:Milkweed-in-seed2.jpg|right|upright|thumb|The seed pod of [[milkweed]] (''Asclepias syriaca'')]]
* Some seeds (e.g., [[pine]]) have a wing that aids in wind dispersal.
* The dustlike seeds of [[orchid]]s are carried efficiently by the wind.
* Some seeds (e.g. [[milkweed]], [[Populus|poplar]]) have hairs that aid in wind dispersal.&lt;ref name="california_desert_flowers_an_introduction_to_families_genera"&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Morhardt | first1 = Sia | last2 = Morhardt | first2 = Emil | last3 = Emil Morhardt | first3 = J. | title = California desert flowers: an introduction to families, genera, and species | url = https://books.google.com/?id=1XyN-u-Bk40C&amp;pg=PA24| year = 2004 | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley  | isbn = 0-520-24003-0 | pages = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other seeds are enclosed in fruit structures that aid wind dispersal in similar ways:
* [[Dandelion]] achenes have hairs.
* [[Maple]] samaras have two wings.

==== By water (hydrochory) ====
* Some plants, such as ''[[Mucuna]]'' and ''[[Dioclea (plant)|Dioclea]]'', produce buoyant seeds termed sea-beans or drift seeds because they float in rivers to the oceans and wash up on beaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seabean.com/|title=www.seabean.com – Sea-Beans and Drift Seeds|work=seabean.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711180958/http://www.seabean.com/|archivedate=2006-07-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== By animals (zoochory) ====
* Seeds ([[burr (fruit)|burrs]]) with barbs or hooks (e.g. [[acaena]], [[burdock]], [[Rumex|dock]]) which attach to animal fur or feathers, and then drop off later.
* Seeds with a fleshy covering (e.g. [[apple]], [[cherry]], [[juniper]]) are eaten by animals ([[bird]]s, [[mammal]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[fish]]) which then disperse these seeds in their [[faeces|droppings]].
* Seeds ([[nut (fruit)|nuts]]) are attractive long-term storable food resources for animals (e.g. [[acorn]]s, [[hazel]]nut, [[walnut]]); the seeds are stored some distance from the parent plant, and some escape being eaten if the animal forgets them.

'''[[Myrmecochory]]''' is the dispersal of seeds by [[ant]]s. Foraging ants disperse seeds which have appendages called [[elaiosome]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Marinelli J | year = 1999 | title = Ants&amp;nbsp;– The astonishing intimacy between ants &amp; plants | url = http://www.bbg.org/gar2/topics/wildlife/1999sp_ants.html | journal = Plants &amp; Gardens News | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060818062717/http://www.bbg.org/gar2/topics/wildlife/1999sp_ants.html | archivedate = 2006-08-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. [[bloodroot]], [[trillium]]s, [[acacia]]s, and many species of [[Proteaceae]]).  Elaiosomes are soft, fleshy structures that contain nutrients for animals that eat them.  The ants carry such seeds back to their nest, where the elaiosomes are eaten.  The remainder of the seed, which is hard and inedible to the ants, then germinates either within the nest or at a removal site where the seed has been discarded by the ants.&lt;ref name="Ricklefs 1993"&gt;Ricklefs, Robert E. (1993) ''The Economy of Nature'', 3rd ed., p.396. (New York: W. H. Freeman). {{ISBN|0-7167-2409-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This dispersal relationship is an example of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], since the plants depend upon the ants to disperse seeds, while the ants depend upon the plants seeds for food.  As a result, a drop in numbers of one partner can reduce success of the other.  In [[South Africa]], the [[Argentine ant]] (''Linepithema humile'') has [[invasive species|invaded]] and displaced native species of ants.  Unlike the native ant species, Argentine ants do not collect the seeds of ''[[Mimetes cucullatus]]'' or eat the elaiosomes.  In areas where these ants have invaded, the numbers of ''Mimetes'' seedlings have dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bond, W. J. |author2=P.

=== Dormancy ===
{{Main|Seed dormancy}}

Seed dormancy has two main functions: the first is synchronizing germination with the optimal conditions for survival of the resulting seedling; the second is spreading germination of a batch of seeds over time so a catastrophe (e.g. late frosts, drought, [[herbivory]]) does not result in the death of all offspring of a plant ([[Bet-hedging (biology)|bet-hedging]]).&lt;ref&gt;Eira MTS, Caldas LS (2000) Seed dormancy and germination as concurrent processes. Rev Bras Fisiol Vegetal 12:85–104&lt;/ref&gt; Seed dormancy is defined as a seed failing to germinate under environmental conditions optimal for germination, normally when the environment is at a suitable temperature with proper soil moisture. This true dormancy or innate dormancy is therefore caused by conditions within the seed that prevent germination. Thus dormancy is a state of the seed, not of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Vleeshouwers L.M., Bouwmeester H.J., Karssen C.M. | year = 1995 | title = Redefining seed dormancy: an attempt to integrate physiology and ecology | url = | journal = Journal of Ecology | volume = 83 | issue = | pages = 1031–1037 | doi=10.2307/2261184}}&lt;/ref&gt; Induced dormancy, enforced dormancy or seed quiescence occurs when a seed fails to germinate because the external environmental conditions are inappropriate for germination, mostly in response to conditions being too dark or light, too cold or hot, or too dry.

Seed dormancy is not the same as seed persistence in the soil or on the plant, though even in scientific publications dormancy and persistence are often confused or used as synonyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Thompson K, Ceriani RM, Bakker JP, Bekker RM | year = 2003 | title = Are seed dormancy and persistence in soil related? | url = | journal = | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 97–100 | doi=10.1079/ssr2003128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, seed dormancy is divided into four major categories: exogenous; endogenous; combinational; and secondary. A more recent system distinguishes five classes: morphological, physiological, morphophysiological, physical, and combinational dormancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Baskin J.M., Baskin C.C. | year = 2004 | title = A classification system for seed dormancy | url = | journal = Seed Science Research | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 1–16 | doi=10.1079/ssr2003150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exogenous dormancy is caused by conditions outside the embryo, including:
* '''Physical dormancy''' or '''hard seed coats''' occurs when seeds are [[Permeability (fluid)|impermeable]] to water. At dormancy break, a specialized structure, the ‘water gap’, is disrupted in response to environmental cues, especially temperature, so water can enter the seed and germination can occur. Plant families where physical dormancy occurs include [[Anacardiaceae]], [[Cannaceae]], [[Convulvulaceae]], [[Fabaceae]] and [[Malvaceae]].&lt;ref&gt;Baskin JM, Baskin CC, Li X (2000) Taxonomy, anatomy and evolution of physical dormancy in seeds. Plant Species Biology 15:139-152&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Chemical dormancy''' considers species that lack physiological dormancy, but where a chemical prevents germination. This chemical can be leached out of the seed by rainwater or snow melt or be deactivated somehow.&lt;ref&gt;Baskin, C.C. and Baskin, J.M. (1998) Seeds: Ecology, biogeography, and evolution of dormancy and germination.San Diego, Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; Leaching of chemical inhibitors from the seed by rain water is often cited as an important cause of dormancy release in seeds of desert plants, but little evidence exists to support this claim.&lt;ref&gt;Gutterman, Y. (1993) Seed germination in desert plants. Springer Verlag, Berlin/Heidelberg.&lt;/ref&gt;

Endogenous dormancy is caused by conditions within the embryo itself, including:
* In '''morphological dormancy''', germination is prevented due to morphological characteristics of the embryo. In some species, the embryo is just a mass of cells when seeds are dispersed; it is not differentiated. Before germination can take place, both differentiation and growth of the embryo have to occur. In other species, the embryo is differentiated but not fully grown (underdeveloped) at dispersal, and embryo growth up to a species specific length is required before germination can occur. Examples of plant families where morphological dormancy occurs are [[Apiaceae]], [[Cycadaceae]], [[Liliaceae]], [[Magnoliaceae]] and [[Ranunculaceae]].&lt;ref name="Baskin, C.C 1998"&gt;Baskin, C.C. and Baskin, J.M. (1998) Seeds: Ecology, biogeography, and evolution of dormancy and germination.San Diego, Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baskin, J.M 2004"&gt;Baskin, J.M. and Baskin, C.C. (2004) A classification system for seed dormancy. Seed Science Research 14:1–16.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Morphophysiological dormancy''' includes seeds with underdeveloped embryos, and also have physiological components to dormancy. These seeds, therefore, require a dormancy-breaking treatments, as well as a period of time to develop fully grown embryos. Plant families where morphophysiological dormancy occurs include [[Apiaceae]], [[Aquifoliaceae]], [[Liliaceae]], [[Magnoliaceae]], [[Papaveraceae]] and [[Ranunculaceae]].&lt;ref name="Baskin, C.C 1998" /&gt; Some plants with morphophysiological dormancy, such as ''[[Asarum]]'' or ''[[Trillium]]'' species, have multiple types of dormancy, one affects radicle (root) growth, while the other affects plumule (shoot) growth. The terms "double dormancy" and "two-year seeds" are used for species whose seeds need two years to complete germination or at least two winters and one summer. Dormancy of the radicle (seedling root) is broken during the first winter after dispersal while dormancy of the shoot bud is broken during the second winter.&lt;ref name="Baskin, C.C 1998" /&gt;
* '''Physiological dormancy''' means the embryo, due to physiological causes, cannot generate enough power to break through the seed coat, endosperm or other covering structures. Dormancy is typically broken at cool wet, warm wet or warm dry conditions. [[Abscisic acid]] is usually the growth inhibitor in seeds, and its production can be affected by light.
** '''Drying''', in some plants, including a number of grasses and those from seasonally arid regions, is needed before they will germinate. The seeds are released, but need to have a lower moisture content before germination can begin. If the seeds remain moist after dispersal, germination can be delayed for many months or even years. Many herbaceous plants from temperate climate zones have physiological dormancy that disappears with drying of the seeds. Other species will germinate after dispersal only under very narrow temperature ranges, but as the seeds dry, they are able to germinate over a wider temperature range.&lt;ref&gt;International Workshop on Seeds, and G. Nicolas. 2003. ''The biology of seeds recent research advances : proceedings of the Seventh International Workshop on Seeds, Salamanca, Spain 2002''. Wallingford, Oxon, UK: CABI Pub. Page 113.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In seeds with '''combinational dormancy''', the seed or fruit coat is impermeable to water and the embryo has physiological dormancy. Depending on the species, physical dormancy can be broken before or after physiological dormancy is broken.&lt;ref name="Baskin, J.M 2004" /&gt;
* '''Secondary dormancy'''* is caused by conditions after the seed has been dispersed and occurs in some seeds when nondormant seed is exposed to conditions that are not favorable to germination, very often high temperatures. The mechanisms of secondary dormancy are not yet fully understood, but might involve the loss of sensitivity in receptors in the plasma membrane.&lt;ref&gt;Bewley, J. Derek, and Michael Black. 1994. ''Seeds physiology of development and germination. The language of science''. New York: Plenum Press. page 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following types of seed dormancy do not involve seed dormancy, strictly speaking, as lack of germination is prevented by the environment, not by characteristics of the seed itself (see [[Germination]]):
* '''Photodormancy''' or light sensitivity affects germination of some seeds. These photoblastic seeds need a period of darkness or light to germinate.  In species with thin seed coats, [[light]] may be able to penetrate into the dormant embryo. The presence of light or the absence of light may trigger the germination process, inhibiting germination in some seeds buried too deeply or in others not buried in the soil.
* '''Thermodormancy''' is seed sensitivity to heat or cold. Some seeds, including cocklebur and amaranth, germinate only at high temperatures (30&amp;nbsp;°C or 86&amp;nbsp;°F); many plants that have seeds that germinate in early to midsummer have thermodormancy, so germinate only when the soil temperature is warm. Other seeds need cool soils to germinate, while others, such as celery, are inhibited when soil temperatures are too warm.  Often, thermodormancy requirements disappear as the seed ages or dries.

Not all seeds undergo a period of dormancy.  Seeds of some [[mangrove]]s are viviparous; they begin to germinate while still attached to the parent. The large, heavy root allows the seed to penetrate into the ground when it falls. Many garden plant seeds will germinate readily as soon as they have water and are warm enough; though their wild ancestors may have had dormancy, these cultivated plants lack it.  After many generations of selective pressure by plant breeders and gardeners, dormancy has been selected out.

For [[annual plant|annuals]], seeds are a way for the species to survive dry or cold seasons. Ephemeral plants are usually annuals that can go from seed to seed in as few as six weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Patten D.T. | year = 1978 | title = Productivity and production efficiency of an Upper Sonoran Desert ephemeral community | url = | journal = American Journal of Botany | volume = 65 | issue = 8| pages = 891–895 | doi = 10.2307/2442185 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Germination ==
{{Main|Seedling|Germination}}
[[File:Sunflower seedlings.jpg|thumb|Germinating [[sunflower]] seedlings]]

Seed germination is a process by which a seed embryo develops into a seedling. It involves the reactivation of the metabolic pathways that lead to growth and the emergence of the radicle or seed root and plumule or shoot. The emergence of the seedling above the soil surface is the next phase of the plant's growth and is called seedling establishment.&lt;ref name="the_encyclopedia_of_seeds"&gt;{{cite book  | last1 = Black | first1 = Michael H. | last2 = Halmer | first2 = Peter | title = The encyclopedia of seeds: science, technology and uses | year = 2006 | publisher = CABI | location = Wallingford, UK  | isbn = 978-0-85199-723-0 | pages = 224  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three fundamental conditions must exist before germination can occur. (1) The embryo must be alive, called seed viability. (2) Any dormancy requirements that prevent germination must be overcome. (3) The proper environmental conditions must exist for germination.

Seed viability is the ability of the embryo to germinate and is affected by a number of different conditions. Some plants do not produce seeds that have functional complete embryos, or the seed may have no embryo at all, often called empty seeds. Predators and pathogens can damage or kill the seed while it is still in the fruit or after it is dispersed. Environmental conditions like flooding or heat can kill the seed before or during germination. The age of the seed affects its health and germination ability: since the seed has a living embryo, over time cells die and cannot be replaced. Some seeds can live for a long time before germination, while others can only survive for a short period after dispersal before they die.

'''Seed vigor''' is a measure of the quality of seed, and involves the viability of the seed, the germination percentage, germination rate and the strength of the seedlings produced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.osu.edu/~seedsci/svvt01.html Seed Vigor and Vigor Tests] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912050649/http://extension.osu.edu/~seedsci/svvt01.html |date=2006-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''germination percentage''' is simply the proportion of seeds that germinate from all seeds subject to the right conditions for growth. The '''germination rate''' is the length of time it takes for the seeds to germinate. Germination percentages and rates are affected by seed viability, dormancy and environmental effects that impact on the seed and seedling. In agriculture and horticulture quality seeds have high viability, measured by germination percentage plus the rate of germination. This is given as a percent of germination over a certain amount of time, 90% germination in 20 days, for example. 'Dormancy' is covered above; many plants produce seeds with varying degrees of dormancy, and different seeds from the same fruit can have different degrees of dormancy.&lt;ref&gt;International Seed Testing Association. 1973. ISSN 0251-0952. Pages 120-21.''Seed science and technology''. Wageningen?: International Seed Testing Association.&lt;/ref&gt; It's possible to have seeds with no dormancy if they are dispersed right away and do not dry (if the seeds dry they go into physiological dormancy). There is great variation amongst plants and a dormant seed is still a viable seed even though the germination rate might be very low.

Environmental conditions affecting seed germination include; water, oxygen, temperature and light.

Three distinct phases of seed germination occur: water imbibition; lag phase; and [[radicle]] emergence.

In order for the seed coat to split, the embryo must imbibe (soak up water), which causes it to swell, splitting the seed coat. However, the nature of the seed coat determines how rapidly water can penetrate and subsequently initiate [[germination]]. The rate of imbibition is dependent on the permeability of the seed coat, amount of water in the environment and the area of contact the seed has to the source of water. For some seeds, imbibing too much water too quickly can kill the seed. For some seeds, once water is imbibed the germination process cannot be stopped, and drying then becomes fatal. Other seeds can imbibe and lose water a few times without causing ill effects, but drying can cause secondary dormancy.

=== Repair of DNA damage ===
During seed [[dormancy]], often associated with unpredictable and stressful environments, [[DNA repair#DNA damage|DNA damage]] accumulates as the seeds age.&lt;ref name=Cheah&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cheah KS |author2=Osborne DJ |title=DNA lesions occur with loss of viability in embryos of ageing rye seed |journal=Nature |volume=272 |issue=5654 |pages=593–9 |date=April 1978  |pmid=19213149 |doi= 10.1038/272593a0|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Koppen&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Koppen G |author2=Verschaeve L |title=The alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis/comet assay: a way to study DNA repair in radicle cells of germinating ''Vicia faba'' |journal=Folia Biol.

=== Inducing germination ===
A number of different strategies are used by gardeners and horticulturists to break [[seed dormancy]].

'''Scarification''' allows water and gases to penetrate into the seed; it includes methods to physically break the hard seed coats or soften them by chemicals, such as soaking in hot water or poking holes in the seed with a pin or rubbing them on sandpaper or cracking with a press or hammer.  Sometimes fruits are harvested while the seeds are still immature and the seed coat is not fully developed and sown right away before the seed coat become impermeable.  Under natural conditions, seed coats are worn down by rodents chewing on the seed, the seeds rubbing against rocks (seeds are moved by the wind or water currents), by undergoing freezing and thawing of surface water, or passing through an animal's digestive tract. In the latter case, the seed coat protects the seed from [[digestion]], while often weakening the seed coat such that the embryo is ready to sprout when it is deposited, along with a bit of fecal matter that acts as fertilizer, far from the parent plant.  [[Microorganism]]s are often effective in breaking down hard seed coats and are sometimes used by people as a treatment; the seeds are stored in a moist warm sandy medium for several months under nonsterile conditions.

'''[[Stratification (botany)|Stratification]]''', also called moist-chilling, breaks down physiological dormancy, and involves the addition of moisture to the seeds so they absorb water, and they are then subjected to a period of moist chilling to after-ripen the embryo. Sowing in late summer and fall and allowing to overwinter under cool conditions is an effective way to stratify seeds; some seeds respond more favorably to periods of oscillating temperatures which are a part of the natural environment.

'''Leaching''' or the soaking in water removes chemical inhibitors in some seeds that prevent germination. [[Rain]] and melting [[snow]] naturally accomplish this task. For seeds planted in gardens, running water is best—if soaked in a container, 12 to 24 hours of soaking is sufficient. Soaking longer, especially in stagnant water, can result in oxygen starvation and seed death. Seeds with hard seed coats can be soaked in hot water to break open the impermeable cell layers that prevent water intake.

Other methods used to assist in the germination of seeds that have dormancy include prechilling, predrying, daily alternation of temperature, light exposure, potassium nitrate, the use of plant growth regulators, such as gibberellins, cytokinins, ethylene, thiourea, sodium hypochlorite, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, Hudson Thomas, and Dale E. Kester. 1983. ''Plant propagation principles and practices''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall. {{ISBN|0-13-681007-1}}. Pages 175-77.&lt;/ref&gt; Some seeds germinate best after a fire. For some seeds, fire cracks hard seed coats, while in others, chemical dormancy is broken in reaction to the presence of smoke. Liquid smoke is often used by gardeners to assist in the germination of these species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/276/5316/1248|title=Trace Gas Emissions and Smoke-Induced Seed Germination|author=Jon E.

=== Sterile seeds ===
Seeds may be sterile for few reasons: they may have been irradiated, unpollinated, cells lived past expectancy, or bred for the purpose.

=== Evolution and origin of seeds ===
The origin of seed plants is a problem that still remains unsolved. However, more and more data tends to place this origin in the middle [[Devonian]]. The description in 2004 of the proto-seed ''Runcaria heinzelinii'' in the [[Givetian]] of [[Belgium]] is an indication of that ancient origin of seed-plants. As with modern ferns, most land plants before this time reproduced by sending spores into the air, that would land and become whole new plants.

The first "true" seeds are described from the upper Devonian, which is probably the theater of their true first evolutionary radiation. With this radiation came an [[evolution of seed size]], shape, dispersal and eventually the radiation of gymnosperms and angiosperms and [[monocotyledon]]s and [[dicotyledon]]s. The seed plants progressively became one of the major elements of nearly all ecosystems.

=== Edible seeds ===
{{further|List of edible seeds}}

Many seeds are edible and the majority of human calories comes from seeds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sabelli, P.A.|author2=Larkins, B.A.|year=2009|title=The Development of Endosperm in Grasses|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=149|issue=1|pages=14–26|url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/149/1/14|doi=10.1104/pp.108.129437|pmid=19126691|pmc=2613697|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924094215/http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/149/1/14|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially from [[cereal]]s, [[legume]]s and [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]]. Seeds also provide most [[cooking oil]]s, many [[beverage]]s and [[spice]]s and some important [[food additive]]s.  In different seeds the [[Embryo#Embryos of plants and animals|seed embryo]] or the [[endosperm]] dominates and provides most of the [[nutrient]]s. The storage [[protein]]s of the embryo and endosperm differ in their [[amino acid]] content and physical properties.  For example, the [[gluten]] of wheat, important in providing the [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] property to bread [[dough]] is strictly an endosperm protein.

Seeds are used to propagate many crops such as cereals, legumes, [[forestry|forest trees]], [[turfgrass]]es, and [[pasture]] grasses. Particularly in developing countries, a major constraint faced is the inadequacy of the marketing channels to get the seed to poor farmers.&lt;ref&gt;G. Mumby [http://www.fao.org/docrep/V4450E/V4450E00.htm Seed Marketing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090909154533/http://www.fao.org/docrep/v4450e/V4450E00.htm |date=2009-09-09 }}, FAO, Rome&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the use of farmer-retained seed remains quite common.

Seeds are also eaten by animals ([[seed predation]]), and are also fed to [[livestock]] or provided as [[birdseed]].

=== Poison and food safety ===
While some seeds are edible, others are harmful, poisonous or deadly.&lt;ref&gt;Chia Joo Suan, "[http://kuali.com/news/story.asp?file=/2006/7/5/kuali/14689925&amp;sec=Kuali Seeds of Doubt: Food Safety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429185024/http://kuali.com/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F7%2F5%2Fkuali%2F14689925&amp;sec=Kuali |date=2008-04-29 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;  Plants and seeds often contain [[chemical compounds]] to discourage [[herbivores]] and [[seed predation|seed predators]].  In some cases, these compounds simply taste bad (such as in [[Mustard (condiment)|mustard]]), but other compounds are toxic or break down into toxic compounds within the [[digestive system]].  Children, being smaller than adults, are more susceptible to poisoning by plants and seeds.&lt;ref&gt;Clelland, Mike.

Normal cooking processes degrade lectins and trypsin inhibitors to harmless forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dhurandhar NV |author2=Chang KC |title=Effect of Cooking on Firmness, Trypsin Inhibitors, Lectins and Cystine/Cysteine content of Navy and Red Kidney Beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) |journal=J Food Sci |volume=55 |issue=2 |pages=470–4 |year=1990 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2621.1990.tb06789.x |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119368153/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other uses ===
[[Cotton]] [[fiber]] grows attached to [[Gossypium|cotton plant]] seeds. Other seed fibers are from [[kapok tree|kapok]] and [[milkweed]].

Many important nonfood oils are extracted from seeds. [[Linseed oil]] is used in paints. Oil from [[jojoba]] and [[crambe]] are similar to [[whale oil]].

Seeds are the source of some medicines including [[castor oil]], [[tea tree oil]] and the quack cancer drug [[Amygdalin|Laetrile]].

Many seeds have been used as [[bead]]s in necklaces and rosaries including [[Job's tears]], [[Chinaberry]], [[Abrus precatorius|rosary pea]], and [[castor bean]]. However, the latter three are also poisonous.

Other seed uses include:
* Seeds once used as weights for [[Weighing scale|balances]].
* Seeds used as toys by children, such as for the game [[Conkers]].
* Resin from ''[[Clusia]] rosea'' seeds used to caulk boats.
* [[Nematicide]] from [[milkweed]] seeds.

== In religion ==
The [[Book of Genesis]] in the Old Testament begins with an explanation of how all plant forms began:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And [[God]] said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so. And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after its kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after its kind: and God saw that it was good. And the evening and the morning were the third day.&lt;ref&gt;[[King James Version]], Genesis 1:12,13, 1611.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Quran]] speaks of seed germination thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is [[Allah]] Who causeth the seed-grain and the date-stone to split and sprout. He causeth the living to issue from the dead, and He is the one to cause the dead to issue from the living. That is Allah: then how are ye deluded away from the truth?&lt;ref&gt;Quran, Translation: Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Al-An'aam 95:6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''field days''' ([[American English]]) or '''Sports days''' ([[British English]]) are events staged by many [[school]]s and [[office]]s in which people participate in competitive [[sport|sporting activities]], often with the aim of winning [[Trophy|trophies]] or [[prizes]]. Though they are often held at the beginning of summer, they are  staged in the autumn or spring seasons, especially in countries where the summer is very harsh. Schools stage many sports days in which children participate in the sporting events. It is usually held in elementary schools, or grades Kindergarten-8th Grade.

In schools which use a [[house system]] a feature of the school is the competition between the houses; this is especially brought out during sporting events such as an inter-house sports day.

Games that are played on school sports days can be wide and varied. They can include straightforward sprints and longer races for all age groups as well as [[egg and spoon race]]s. [[Three legged race]]s are run as well as [[sack race]]s, [[wheelbarrow race]]s, and parent and child races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordon|first=Chris|title=Mr|url=http://www.trophiesawardsandgifts.com/blog/organising-a-school-sports-day/|work=Trophies Awards and Gifts Store|publisher=Trophies Awards and Gifts Store|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional games are traditionally run in Ireland, and the UK, such as [[horseshoes]].

==Controversies==

There have been a number of controversies surrounding school sports days in recent years, many of which have been publicised by the media.

Some schools have abolished or heavily altered sports days on the grounds that they are too competitive and may damage pupils' [[self-esteem]], with some commentators calling for the event to be banned due to the public humiliation caused to those children who are not gifted athletically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/jul/14/schoolsports.schools|title=Why I want to ban sports day|first=Clint|last=Witchalls|date=14 July 2004|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view has been condemned as "[[political correctness]]" by many commentators, notably by journalist [[Melanie Phillips]] in her 1996 book ''All Must Have Prizes''.,&lt;ref name= naga&gt;{{cite web |title=All Must Have Prizes  |author=Melanie Phillips |publisher= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a book heavily criticised by reviewers for its prejudiced, fact-less and distorted analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/all-must-have-prizes-by-melanie-phillips-little-brown-pounds-1750-1363087.html|title=All Must Have Prizes By Melanie Phillips Little, Brown pounds 17.50|date=13 September 1996|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' magazine published a report claiming that school sports days have become excessively competitive due to overbearing and "over-zealous" parents, who place too much pressure on their children to succeed. The report also revealed that many schools have banned "mothers and fathers" races due to fighting and cheating.

Since the mid-1990s, a number of schools and education authorities have banned photography and filming with [[video camera]]s at sports days and other school events. Some authorities cite general privacy issues as justification for the ban. Others have raised concerns about [[pedophiles]], which in turn has sparked accusations of hysteria and [[moral panic]]. Many parents have expressed anger at being unable to take photographs or videos as souvenirs of these events, and the ban has been criticised by some as a [[Paranoia|paranoid]] over-reaction to public concerns about pedophilia and child safety issues.

==International==
===India===
In India, sports days are held for 2 - 3 days. These include games like [[football]], [[cricket]], [[throw ball]], [[dodge ball]], [[volleyball]], [[track and field]], [[basketball]] etc. These sports days are held between the various houses in a particular school. In India, many traditional games such as Kho-Kho and Kabaddi, March-past are played.

===Japan===
{{main|Health and Sports Day}}
Sports day, called ''undōkai'' (運動会) in Japanese, is usually held on a Saturday or Sunday in [[Education in Japan|Japanese schools]].  During weeks preceding the sports day, students practice their events which they would like to show their parents and friends, within their class of physical education, which often includes ''[[tamaire]]'', performances by the school band and presentations by various school clubs as well as individual and group competitive events.  These practices, and the sports days themselves, normally take place on the schools' fields, which provide little relief from the heat and sun.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Some schools have responded by scheduling their sports days during cooler months and by encouraging their students to drink water regularly. Currently, the event occurs most often in the autumn (September/October), or in the spring (May/June). In [[Primary education|primary school]]s in [[Hokkaidō]], the event is usually held between the later part of May and the earlier part of June.&lt;ref&gt;Fukue, Natsuko, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20101019i1.html No escaping annual sports days]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 19 October 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Sports Day in [[Russia]] is held on the second Saturday in August. 

===Qatar===
Sports day in [[Qatar]] is a national holiday, held every second-Tuesday of February every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = اليوم الرياضي الوطني - Qatar Sports for all Federation|url = http://sportday.qa|website = Qatar Sports for all Federation|access-date = 2016-02-08|language = ar-AR}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Qatar Olympic Committee]] is tasked with organizing the large-scale nationwide activities that are held all over Qatar, and include a wide variety of sports such as; football, basketball, tennis, marathons, open walks, as well as regional sports such as camel riding. Other venues of sports day include [[Aspire Zone]], Katara, [[The Pearl-Qatar|The Pearl]], among others. Sports day's popularity extends to the point that [[Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani|Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani]], Qatar's Emir is casually seen participating in events.

==In offices==
Many large organizations have sports days for their employees. One notable example is [[Her Majesty's Civil Service]] in the UK, which holds a number of departmental sports days.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3662">'''UTeach''' is a [[certified teacher|teacher certification]] program administered by the [[University of Texas at Austin College of Natural Sciences|College of Natural Sciences]] and the College of Education at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. It was created in 1997 to address both the shortage of qualified secondary mathematics, science, and computer science teachers as well as the quality of those entering the field.

The program has been well-received, cited by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] as a model program addressing the need for more highly qualified mathematics and science teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Committee on Prospering in the Global Economy of the 21st Century; Committee on Science, Engineering, and Public Policy | publisher=[[National Academies Press]] | title=Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-309-10039-7 | url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11463}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program has expanded within the [[University of Texas at Austin College of Education]] to focus on diverse students in urban settings through English and social studies education with [[UTeach Urban Teachers]] program.

UTeach has been a model for mathematics and science education programs at other institutions, and has been expanded to involve an additional forty-four universities in twenty-one states by 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uteach-institute.org/files/uploads/uteach_enrollment_map.pdf |title=Universities Replicating UTeach Spring 2014 enrollment nationwide (6,704 students)  |date=January 26, 2015 |website=http://www.uteach-institute.org/ |publisher=UTeach Institute |access-date=February 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''waste-to-energy plant''' is a [[waste management]] facility that combusts wastes to produce [[electricity]]. This type of [[power plant]] is sometimes called a trash-to-energy, municipal waste incineration, [[energy recovery]], or [[resource recovery]] plant.

Modern [[waste-to-energy]] plants are very different from the trash [[incinerator]]s that were commonly used until a few decades ago. Unlike modern ones, those plants usually did not remove hazardous or recyclable materials before burning. These incinerators endangered the health of the plant workers and the nearby residents, and most of them did not generate electricity.

Waste-to-energy generation is being increasingly looked at as a potential energy diversification strategy, especially by Sweden, which has been a leader in waste-to-energy production over the past 20 years. The typical range of net electrical energy that can be produced is about 500 to 600 [[kWh]] of electricity per [[ton]] of waste incinerated.&lt;ref name=Columbia&gt;[http://www.seas.columbia.edu/earth/wtert/wtertfaq.html The ABC of Integrated Waste Management]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the incineration of about 2,200 tons per day of waste will produce about 1200 [[Megawatt|MWh]] of electrical energy.

==How it works==

Most waste-to-energy plants burn [[municipal solid waste]], but some burn [[industrial waste]] or [[hazardous waste]]. A modern, properly run waste-to-energy plant sorts material before burning it and can co-exist with [[recycling]]. The only items that are burned are not recyclable, by design or economically, and are not hazardous.

Waste-to-energy plants are similar in their design and equipment with other steam-electric power plants, particularly [[biomass]] plants. First, the waste is brought to the facility. Then, the waste is sorted to remove recyclable and hazardous materials. The waste is then stored until it is time for burning. A few plants use [[gasification]], but most combust the waste directly because it is a mature, efficient technology. The waste can be added to the [[boiler]] continuously or in batches, depending on the design of the plant.

In terms of volume, waste-to-energy plants incinerate 80 to 90 percent of waste. Sometimes, the residue ash is clean enough to be used for some purposes such as raw materials for use in manufacturing cinder blocks or for road construction. In addition, the metals that may be burned are collected from the bottom of the [[furnace]] and sold to [[foundries]]. Some waste-to-energy plants convert salt water to potable fresh water as a by-product of cooling processes.

==Cost==

The typical plant with capacity of 400GWh energy production annually costs about 440 million dollars to build.
Waste-to-energy plants may have a significant cost advantage over traditional power options, as the waste-to-energy operator may receive revenue for receiving waste as an alternative to the cost of disposing of waste in a landfill, typically referred to as a "tipping fee" per ton basis, versus having to pay for the cost of fuel, whereas fuel cost can account for as much as 45 percent of the cost to produce electricity in a [[coal]]-powered plant, and 75 percent or more of the cost in a [[natural gas]]-powered plant. The [http://www.nswma.org National Solid Waste Management Association] estimates that the average United States tipping fee for 2002 was $33.70 per ton.

==Pollution==

Waste-to-energy plants cause lesser [[air pollution]] than [[coal]] plants, but more than [[natural gas]] plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dswa.com/programs/programs_wastetoenergy_4.htm Waste-to-Energy Compared to Fossil Fuels for Equal Amounts of Energy] (Delaware Solid Waste Authority)&lt;/ref&gt;

Waste-to-energy plants are designed to reduce the emission of [[air pollutant]]s in the [[flue gas]]es exhausted to the atmosphere, such as [[nitrogen oxides]], [[sulfur oxides]] and [[particulates]], and to destroy pollutants already present in the waste, using pollution control measures such as [[baghouse]]s, [[scrubber]]s, and [[electrostatic precipitator]]s. High temperature, efficient combustion, and effective scrubbing and controls can significantly reduce [[air pollution]] outputs.

Burning municipal waste does produce significant amounts of [[dioxin]] and [[furan]] emissions&lt;ref&gt;Beychok, M.R., ''A data base of dioxin and furan emissions from municipal refuse incinerators'', Atmospheric Environment, Elsevier B.V., January 1987&lt;/ref&gt; to the atmosphere as compared to the smaller amounts produced by burning coal or natural gas. Dioxins and furans are considered by many to be serious health hazards. However, advances in emission control designs and very stringent new governmental regulations, as well as public opposition to municipal waste incinerators, have caused large reductions in the amount of dioxins and furans produced by waste-to-energy plants.

Waste-to-energy plants produce [[fly ash]] and [[bottom ash]] just as is the case when coal is combusted. The total amount of ash produced by waste-to-energy plants ranges from 15% to 25% by weight of the original quantity of waste, and the fly ash amounts to about 10% to 20% of the total ash.&lt;ref name=Columbia/&gt; The fly ash, by far, constitutes more of a potential health hazard than does the bottom ash because the fly ash contains toxic metals such as [[lead]], [[cadmium]], [[copper]], and [[zinc]] as well as small amounts of dioxins and furans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collectionscanada.ca/obj/s4/f2/dsk2/ftp03/NQ27620.pdf  University of Toronto, PhD Thesis] Chan, C.C., ''Behaviour of metals in MSW fly ash during roasting with chlorinating agents'', Chemical Engineering Department, University of Toronto, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The bottom ash may or may not contain significant levels of health hazardous materials. In the United States, and perhaps in other countries as well, the law requires that the ash be tested for toxicity before disposal in landfills. If the ash is found to be hazardous, it can only be disposed of in landfills which are carefully designed to prevent pollutants in the ash from leaching into underground [[aquifers]].

[[Odor]] pollution can be a problem when the plant location is not isolated. Some plants store the waste in an enclosed area with a negative pressure, which prevents unpleasant odors from escaping, and the air drawn from the storage area is sent through the boiler or a filter. However, not all plants take steps to reduce the odor, resulting in complaints.

An issue that affects community relationships is the increased road traffic of garbage trucks to transport municipal waste to the waste-to-energy facility. Due to this reason, most waste-to-energy plants are located in industrial areas.

Landfill gas, which contains about 50% [[methane]], and 50% [[carbon dioxide]], is contaminated with a small amount of pollutants. Unlike at waste-to-energy plants, there are little or no pollution controls on the burning of [[landfill gas]]. The gas is usually flared or used to run a [[reciprocating engine]] or [[microturbine]], especially in [[digester gas]] power plants. Cleaning up the landfill gas is usually not cost effective because [[natural gas]], which it substitutes for, is relatively cheap.

==Example==
* [http://www.svz-gmbh.de/GB/Seiten/rahmen.html SVZ Schwarze Pumpe GmbH] in Germany processes many kinds of wastes by [[gasification]] to heat, electricity and [[syngas]]. Syngas is converted to [[methanol]] and [[formaldehyde]].

The '''Woods Hole Research Center''' (WHRC) is a scientific research organization that studies climate change impacts and solutions. WHRC was named the world's top climate change think tank for 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 by the International Center for Climate Governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.capecodtimes.com/article/20160701/NEWS/160709923|title=Woods Hole think tank takes top spot on climate change|last=Driscoll|first=Sean|date=July 1, 2016|work=Cape Cod Times|access-date=August 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center conducts research on the causes and impacts of climate change throughout the tropics, the Arctic, and North America. All of WHRC's work is designed to inform policy or answer policy questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whrc.org/our-work/interactive-map/|title=Woods Hole Research Center - Where We Work|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Woods Hole Research Center|access-date=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/12/09/a-paris-climate-agreement-is-supposed-to-help-save-the-planet-but-the-planet-may-have-other-ideas/|title=How the Earth itself could undermine a Paris climate agreement|last=Mooney|first=Chris|date=December 9, 2015|work=Washington Post|access-date=August 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/gustavo-silvachavez/forests-emerge-as-a-big-w_b_8793226.html|title=Forests Emerge as a Big Winner in Paris Agreement|last=Silva-Chavez|first=Gustavo|date=December 12, 2015|work=Huffington Post|access-date=August 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
WHRC's mission is to advance scientific discovery and seek science-based solutions for the world’s environmental and economic challenges through research and education.

== History ==
The Woods Hole Research Center was established in 1985 in [[Woods Hole]], [[Massachusetts]] by [[George Woodwell]]. WHRC was one of the first organizations dedicated to fighting global climate change and Woodwell testified to Congress in 1986 about the dangers of sea level rise and global warming.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/06/11/30-years-ago-scientists-warned-congress-on-global-warming-what-they-said-sounds-eerily-familiar/|title=30 years ago scientists warned Congress on global warming. What they said sounds eerily familiar|last=Mooney|first=Chris|date=June 11, 2016|work=Washington Post|access-date=August 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan for developing the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] was drafted at the Woods Hole Research Center in the late 1980s by Woodwell and Kiliparti Ramakrishna.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://capeandislands.org/post/paris-agreement-effect-much-work-remains-stabilize-climate#stream/0|title=Paris Agreement in Effect, But Much Work Remains to Stabilize Climate|last=Goldstone|first=Heather|date=November 7, 2016|work=WCAI|access-date=January 4, 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, Dr. [[John P. Holdren]] became the director and he continued to lead the organization until he was appointed as President Obama's science advisor in 2009.  Holdren returned to WHRC as a senior advisor in 2017 after President Obama left office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.capecodtimes.com/news/20170302/former-obama-science-adviser-returns-to-cape|title=Former Obama science adviser returns to Cape|last=Fraser|first=Doug|work=capecodtimes.com|access-date=2017-03-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's current president is Dr. Philip Duffy, a physicist who was formerly the White House [[National Science and Technology Council]]’s Senior Advisor to the U.S. Global Change Research Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://capeandislands.org/post/meet-directors-three-new-presidents-take-helm-woods-hole#stream/0|title=Meet the Directors: Three New Presidents Take the Helm in Woods Hole|last=Goldstone|first=Heather|date=November 2, 2015|work=WCAI|access-date=August 25, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; WHRC has about 60 staff members. 
[[File:WHRC.jpg|thumb|The Woods Hole Research Center headquarters in Falmouth, MA]]
The Center’s Gilman Ordway Campus, located on Cape Cod in the town of [[Falmouth, Massachusetts|Falmouth]], was completed in 2004. The {{convert|19300|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} building is composed of a renovated summer estate (ca. 1874) and a new wing. The campus is [[Energy neutral design|energy neutral]], with renewable power generated by a 100kW wind turbine, as well as rooftop photo-voltaic power systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whrc.org/about-whrc/environmentally-friendly-campus/|title=Environmentally-Friendly Campus – Woods Hole Research Center|website=whrc.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Jewish Congress''' ('''WJC''') was founded in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], in August 1936 as an international federation of [[Jews|Jewish]] communities and organizations. According to its mission statement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/about|title=World Jewish Congress - About Us}}&lt;/ref&gt; the World Jewish Congress' main purpose is to act as "the diplomatic arm of the Jewish people." Membership in the WJC is open to all representative Jewish groups or communities, irrespective of the social, political or economic ideology of the community's host country. The World Jewish Congress headquarters are in [[New York City]], US, and the organization maintains international offices in [[Brussels, Belgium]]; [[Jerusalem, Israel]]; [[Paris, France]]; [[Moscow, Russia]]; [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]]; and [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. The WJC has [[List of organizations with consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council|special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council]].

== Organization and related bodies ==
The WJC is made up of five regional branches: WJC [[North America]], the Latin American Jewish Congress, the [[European Jewish Congress]], the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress, and the WJC Israel. Besides that, Jewish umbrella organizations in 100 countries are directly affiliated to the World Jewish Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/about|title= World Jewish Congress - About Us|accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its highest decision-making body is the Plenary Assembly, which meets every four years and elects the lay leadership (Executive Committee) of the WJC. In between plenary assemblies, meetings of the WJC Governing Board are normally held once a year. Affiliated Jewish organizations send delegates to these two WJC bodies; their number depends on the size of the Jewish communities they represent.

A special meeting of the Plenary Assembly, attended by over 400 delegates and observers from over 70 countries, was held in Buenos Aires in March 2015. The last regular plenary assembly was held In New York in April 2017, and prior to that in Budapest in May 2013, with 600 delegates and observers in attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/hungarian-prime-minister-to-address-world-jewish-congress-in-budapest.premium-1.519110|title=Hungarian Prime Minister to Address World Jewish Congress in Budapest|first=Judy|last=Maltz|date=3 May 2013|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC also maintains a Research Institute based in Jerusalem, Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/instwjc.html|title=Institute of the World Jewish Congress|accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is involved in research and analysis of a variety of issues of importance to contemporary Jewry, and its findings are published in the form of policy dispatches.

The WJC's current policy priorities include combating anti-Semitism, especially the rise of neo-Nazi parties in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budapesttimes.hu/2013/05/10/world-jewish-congress-demands-action-against-neo-nazis/|title=World Jewish Congress demands action against neo-Nazis - Budapest Times, 10 May 2013|publisher=|access-date=2013-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020621/http://www.budapesttimes.hu/2013/05/10/world-jewish-congress-demands-action-against-neo-nazis/|archive-date=2013-12-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing political support for Israel, opposing the "Iranian threat", and dealing with the legacy of the Holocaust, notably with respect to property restitution, reparation and compensation for Holocaust survivors, as well as with Holocaust remembrance. One of the WJC's major programs is concerned with the plight of [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]]. The WJC is also involved in [[Religious pluralism|inter-faith dialogue]] with Christian and Muslim groups.

===Current World Jewish Congress leadership===
At the 13th Plenary Assembly in Jerusalem in January 2009, [[Ronald S. Lauder]] was formally and unanimously elected as WJC president, having previously served as acting president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/34154|publisher=European Jewish Press|title=Ronald S.

==History==
The World Jewish Congress was established in Geneva, [[Switzerland]] in August, 1936, in reaction to the rise of Nazism and the growing wave of European anti-Semitism. Since its foundation, it has been a permanent body with offices around the world. The main aims of the organization were "to mobilize the Jewish people and the democratic forces against the Nazi onslaught", to "fight for equal political and economic rights everywhere, and particularly for the Jewish minorities in Central and Eastern Europe", to support the establishment of a "Jewish National Home in Palestine" and to create "a worldwide Jewish representative body based on the concept of the unity of the Jewish people, democratically organized and able to act on matters of common concern".&lt;ref name="Garai"&gt;George Garai (ed.), World Jewish Congress, 40 Years in Action 1936-1976, Geneva 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/databases/holocaust/0131_World_Jewish_Congress.html|title=World Jewish Collection – An Introduction by Nolan Altman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precursor organizations (1917-1936)===
The WJC's precursor organizations were the [[American Jewish Congress]] and the ''Comité des Délégations Juives'' (Committee of Jewish Delegations). The latter was established in March 1919 to represent Jewish communities at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], and advocated for Jewish minority rights in various countries, including the negotiation of rights for Jews in Turkey in the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] (1920) and special agreements with smaller eastern European states. Headed by Russian Zionist [[Leo Motzkin]], the ''Comité des Délégations Juives'' was composed of delegations from Palestine, the United States, Canada, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, East Galicia, Romania, Transylvania, Bukovina, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Yugoslavia, and Greece, and funded mainly by the [[World Zionist Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Unity in Dispersion: A History of the World Jewish Congress, World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 26-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631187288_chunk_g97806311872888_ss1-198|author=Blackwell Reference Online|title=Comité des Délégations Juives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanjewisharchives.org/aja/FindingAids/ms0361/ |title= A Collection Overview to the World Jewish Congress Records. 1918-1982.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the first impetus for the creation of the WJC came from the [[American Jewish Congress]]. In December 1917, the AJC adopted a resolution calling for the "convening of a World Jewish Congress", "as soon as peace is declared among the warring nations" in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, Motzkin visited the United States and addressed the AJC Executive Committee, "pleading for a World Conference of Jews to discuss the conditions of Jews in various lands and to devise ways and means for effective protection of Jewish rights."&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p.28&lt;/ref&gt; Conferences co-organized by Motzkin and the AJC leaders [[Julian Mack]] and [[Stephen Wise]] took place in 1926 in London and in 1927 in Zurich, Switzerland. The latter was attended by 65 Jews from 13 countries, representing 43 Jewish organizations, though the main Jewish groups in Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, as well as the [[American Jewish Committee]], declined the invitation to attend.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Preparatory World Jewish Conference was held in Geneva in August 1932. A preparatory committee was headed by Zionist [[Nahum Goldmann]], who was one of the leading advocates of the establishment of an international Jewish representative body.&lt;ref name="Garai, pg. 10 and 20"&gt;Garai, pg. 10 and 20&lt;/ref&gt; Goldmann defined the purpose of the World Jewish Congress as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is to establish the permanent address of the Jewish people; amidst the fragmentation and atomization of Jewish life and of the Jewish community; it is to establish a real, legitimate, collective representation of Jewry which will be entitled to speak in the name of the 16 million Jews to the nations and governments of the world, as well as to the Jews themselves.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The conference approved plans to set up the new organization in 1934, with headquarters in New York and European offices in Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1932"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1932/08/18/2795280/geneva-conference-approves-call-for-world-jewish-congress-in-summer-of-1934|author=JTA|title=Geneva Conference Approves Call for World Jewish Congress in Summer of 1934, 18 August 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="americanjewisharchives.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanjewisharchives.org/aja/FindingAids/ms0361/|title= A Collection Overview to the World Jewish Congress Records. 1918-1982.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a manifesto, delegates called upon the Jewish people to unite as the only effective means of averting danger. The Jews, the declaration said, had to rely on their own power with the assistance of such enlightened sections of the world which had not yet been saturated with poisonous anti-Semitism. It added: "The World Jewish Congress does not aim at weakening any existing organizations, but rather to support and stimulate them."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1932"/&gt; The new organization would be based on the "concept of the Jewish people as a national entity, and authorized and obligated to deal with all problems affecting Jewish life."&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1933, following the rise to power of [[Adolf Hitler]] and his NSDAP in Germany, [[American Jewish Congress]] President Bernard Deutsch called on US Jewish organizations to support the establishment of a World Jewish Congress "to prove the sincerity of their stand" in favor of the embattled Jews of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1933/07/02/2801209/world-jewish-congress-nearerdeutsch-american-delegates-soon-sail-to-confer|author=JTA|title=World Jewish Congress Nearer—Deutsch; American Delegates Soon Sail to Confer, 2 July 1933}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation (1936)===
After two more preparatory conferences in 1933 and 1934, the First Plenary Assembly, held in Geneva in August 1936, established the World Jewish Congress as a permanent and democratic organization. Elections for delegates to that assembly had to be according to democratic principles, namely secret, direct, and based on proportional representation. The 52 American delegates, for instance, were chosen at an Electoral Convention which met in Washington, DC, on 13/14 June 1936 and which was attended by 1,000 representatives from 99 communities in 32 US states.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Jewish Congress's expressed goal was Jewish unity and the strengthening of Jewish political influence in order to assure the survival of the Jewish people, which involved the creation of a Jewish state.&lt;ref name="Garai, pg. 10 and 20"/&gt; 230 delegates representing 32 countries gathered for the first WJC assembly. Addressing a press conference in Geneva, [[Stephen S. Wise]] assailed German Jews for opposing the WJC. He said: "I must make clear that the congress is not a parliament nor an attempt at a parliament. It is nothing more than an assembly of representatives of those Jewries which choose to associate themselves in defense of Jewish rights. The congress will not be wholly representative until all Jews choose to be represented by it."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1936/08/09/2835383/world-jewish-congress-set-to-open-tonight-8-point-program-mapped|title=World Jewish Congress Set to Open Tonight; 8 Point Program Mapped|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nahum Goldmann.jpg|thumb|[[Nahum Goldmann]], co-founder and president of the World Jewish Congress from 1949 to 1977]]
Although the delegates elected the US federal judge and erstwhile president of the American Jewish Congress [[Julian Mack]] as honorary president of the WJC, Wise was appointed as chairman of the WJC Executive and thus ''de facto'' leader of the congress. [[Nahum Goldmann]] was named as chair of the Administrative Committee.&lt;ref name="Garai, pg. 10 and 20"/&gt; The new WJC Executive immediately drew up a declaration asking the British government not to halt immigration into Palestine and presented it to British diplomats in Bern, Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1936/08/17/2835437/world-congress-leaders-to-see-british-envoy-on-palestine-today|author=JTA|title=World Congress Leaders to See British Envoy on Palestine Today, 16 August 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC chose Paris as its headquarters and also opened a liaison office to the [[League of Nations]] in Geneva, first headed by the Swiss international lawyer and WJC Legal Advisor [[Paul Guggenheim]] and later by [[Gerhart Riegner]], who initially served as Guggenheim's secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhart Riegner - Never Despair: Sixty Years in the Service of the Jewish People and of Human Rights, published by Ivan R. Dee, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In its fight against growing anti-Semitism in Europe, the WJC pursued a two-pronged approach: the political and legal sphere (mainly the lobbying of the [[League of Nations]] and public statements) on the one hand, and an attempt to organize a boycott of products from countries such as Nazi Germany on the other. Given the weakness of the [[League of Nations]] vis-à-vis Germany and the successful efforts by the Nazi regime to stave off an economic boycott of German products, both approaches proved not very effective.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p.83-110&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the November 1938 pogroms against Jews in Germany called [[Kristallnacht]] in which at least 91 Jews were killed and many synagogues and Jewish shops destroyed, the WJC issued a statement: "Though the Congress deplores the fatal shooting of an official of the German Embassy in Paris by a young Polish Jew of seventeen, it is obliged to protest energetically against the violent attacks in the German press against the whole of Judaism because of this act and, especially, to protest against the reprisals taken against the German Jews after the crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roizen.com/ron/grynszpan.htm|first=Ron|last=Roizen |title=Herschel Grynszpan: the Fate of A Forgotten Assassin, Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Vol. 1, No.2., 1986, pp. 217-228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, the WJC headquarters moved from Paris to Geneva to facilitate communications with Jewish communities in Europe. In the summer of 1940, by which time most of Europe had fallen under [[Nazi]] occupation, the World Jewish Congress's headquarters were moved to New York to share office space with the American Jewish Congress, and a special WJC office was set up in London. The British Section of the WJC was tasked with acting as the European representative of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p.122-123&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the personnel who worked in the WJC's European offices immigrated to the United States when the WJC moved its headquarters there. At the New York office in the 1940s, the major departments were: Political Department, Institute of Jewish Affairs (research and legal work), Relief and Rescue, Department for Culture and Education (or Culture Department), and Organization Department. In 1940, the WJC opened a representative office in Buenos Aires, Argentina.&lt;ref name="americanjewisharchives.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-2587504540/comit-des-delegations-juives.html|first=Nathan|last=Feinberg|title=Comité des Délégations Juives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WJC efforts during the Holocaust and its aftermath===
The WJC's initial priorities included safeguarding Jewish minority rights, combating anti-Semitism in Europe, and providing emergency relief to Jews fleeing Nazi persecution. The WJC also concentrated on security for Jewish refugees and victims of the war. In 1939, the World Jewish Congress set up a relief committee for Jewish war refugees (RELICO) and cooperated with the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] to protect Jews in Nazi-occupied countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%205816.pdf|title=Relief Committee for the Warstricken Jewish Population (RELICO)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nahum Goldmann, Stephen Wise, Henri Torres at World Jewish Congress conference in New York, June 1942.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|left|Left to right: [[Nahum Goldmann]], [[Stephen Wise]], and French lawyer [[Henri Torres|Henry Torrès]] (speaking) at a World Jewish Congress conference in New York City, 7 June 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1942/06/08/2857896/immediate-restoration-of-jewish-rights-in-europe-after-allied-victory-demanded|title=Immediate Restoration of Jewish Rights in Europe After Allied Victory Demanded|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] Under the auspices of the WJC, 18 committees were set up in the United States composed of exiled representatives of the different European Jewish communities under Nazi rule. The committees were modeled on the governments-in-exile, and their task was to provide moral and material support for Jews in the respective countries, and to prepare a program of Jewish postwar demands. All representative committees together formed the Advisory Council on European Jewish Affairs, which came into being at a conference in New York City in June 1942.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 128-129&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC also lobbied Allied governments on behalf of Jewish refugees, and urged US Jewish organizations to work towards waiving immigration quotas for Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution. In 1940, General [[Charles de Gaulle]], the leader of the French government in exile, pledged to the WJC that all measures taken by the [[Vichy regime]] against the Jews would be repudiated upon France's liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1941 and early 1942, Western diplomats and journalists received scattered information about Nazi massacres of many thousands of Jews in German-occupied Poland and Russia. However, the news was difficult to confirm. In June 1942, [[Ignacy Schwarzbart]], one of two Jewish representatives on the Polish National Council of the Polish government-in-exile, held a press conference with WJC officials in London, where it was stated that an estimated one million Jews had already been murdered by the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jtnews.net/index.php?/viewpoints/item/9254/C26 |first=Rafael |last=Medoff |title=How America first learned of the Holocaust|date=2012-06-20|accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Riegner Telegram====
{{Main|Riegner Telegram}}

On 8 August 1942, the WJC's Geneva representative [[Gerhart Riegner]] sent a telegram to the US vice-consul in Geneva in which he informed the Allies for the first time about the Nazis planned [[Final Solution]] to exterminate all Jews in the German-occupied territories.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/holocaust/filmmore/reference/primary/newsusdept.html U.S. State Department receives information from Switzerland regarding the Nazi plan to murder the Jews of Europe]: The American Experience&lt;/ref&gt; Riegner had received his information from the German industrialist [[Eduard Schulte]].

His telegram read as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Received alarming report about plan being discussed and considered in ''Führer'' headquarters to exterminate at one fell swoop all Jews in German-controlled countries comprising three and a half to four million after deportation and concentration in the east thus solving Jewish question once and for all stop campaign planned for autumn methods being discussed including hydrocyanic acid stop&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:World Jewish Congress War Emergency Conference Atlantic City 1944.jpg|thumb|[[Louise Waterman Wise]], Jewish activist and wife of WJC President [[Stephen Samuel Wise|Stephen S. Wise]], addressing the World Jewish Congress War Emergency Conference in Atlantic City, November 1944]]
It was only several weeks later, on 28 August 1942, that WJC President [[Stephen S. Wise]] received Riegner's alarming message.&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Medoff, [http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/06/11/how-america-first-learned-of-the-holocaust "How America First Learnede of the Holocaust"] The Algemeiner (June 11, 2012). Retrieved June 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Riegner Telegram|telegram]] was met with disbelief despite preexisting evidence for mass executions. The US State Department considered it "a wild rumor, fueled by Jewish anxieties", while the British Foreign Office refused to forward the telegram for the time being and called for the allegations to be investigated first. It was only on 25 November 1942 that the WJC was allowed to release the news to the world.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July 1942, 20,000 people participated in a WJC-organized "Stop Hitler Now" demonstration at New York's Madison Square Garden. Nine months later, on 1 March 1943, an estimated 22,000 people crowded into the same hall and a further 15,000 stood outside at a WJC rally addressed by Wise, [[Chaim Weizmann]], New York Mayor [[Fiorello LaGuardia]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/holocaust/peopleevents/pandeAMEX101.html |title=The American Experience.America and the Holocaust.People &amp; Events &amp;#124; Rabbi Stephen Wise (1874-1949) |publisher=PBS |date=1942-08-28 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the US government did not heed calls to rescue European Jews. Early in 1944, US Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]] stated in front of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] that "certain officials in our State Department" had failed while it would have been commanded by duty to "prevent the extermination of the Jews in German-controlled Europe".

====Rescue efforts====
Throughout the war, the WJC lobbied the Allied governments to grant visas to Jewish refugees from Europe and to ensure the restoration of Jewish minority rights in areas liberated by the Allied forces.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the US State Department's opposition, the WJC obtained permission from the [[US Treasury Department]], headed by [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]], to transmit funds to Europe for the rescue and assistance of persecuted Jews. According to a report by Riegner, these funds helped to bring 1,350 Jewish children from the occupied countries to Switzerland and 70 to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at the [[Bermuda Conference|Bermuda Refugee Conference]] in 1943, both the United States and Britain refused to relax their immigration policies, not even for British Mandatory Palestine. In reaction, the WJC published a comment which said: "The truth is that what stands in the way of aid to the Jews in Europe by the United Nations is not that such a program is dangerous, but simple lack of will to go to any trouble on their behalf."&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Only in January 1944, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered the setting up of the [[War Refugee Board]], whose purpose was to "rescue victims of enemy oppression who are in imminent danger of death".&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Jewish Congress also tried - mostly in vain - to convince the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) to assert its authority more forcefully vis-à-vis the Germans, and urged it to secure the status of civilian prisoners of war under the [[Third Geneva Convention]] on prisoners of war for those Jews that were confined to ghettos and Nazi concentration camps, which would have entitled the ICRC to provide care to them. However, the ICRC stuck to the view that it was "in no position to bring pressure to bear upon governments", and that the success of its work "depended on discreet and friendly successions."&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 168-169&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holocaust era president of WJC, [[Stephen Wise]], opposed the [[Bergson Group]]'s rescue activism.&lt;ref&gt;The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust, 1941-1945 (Pantheon Books, 1984) {{ISBN|978-0-394-42813-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Deafening Silence: American Jewish Leaders and the Holocaust (New York: Shapolsky Publishers, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Later president [[Nachum Goldman]] told the State Department (per department protocol) that [[Hillel Kook]] (aka [[Peter Bergson]]) is an adventurer and does not represent "organized Jewry". He pleaded to either deport or draft Hillel Kook in order to stop his activism&lt;ref&gt;A Race Against Death: Peter Bergson, America, and the Holocaust, with David S. Wyman (The New Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Letter to State Department====
[[File:A. Leon Kubowitzki.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|left|[[Aryeh Leon Kubowitzki]]]]

On 9 August 1944, Leon Kubowitzki (later Aryeh Leon Kubovy), the head of the WJC's Rescue Department, relayed a message from Ernest Frischer of the Czechoslovak State Council to the US State Department urging the destruction of the gas chambers and the bombing of railways lines leading to the [[Auschwitz]] death camp. US Undersecretary of War John J. McCloy rejected the suggestion five days later, writing to Kubowitzki:

&lt;blockquote&gt;After a study it became apparent that such an operation could be executed only by the diversion of considerable air support essential to the success of our forces now engaged in decisive operations elsewhere and would in any case be of such doubtful efficacy that it would not warrant the use of our resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/holocaust/filmmore/reference/primary/bombworld.html|title=The World Jewish Congress in New York asks the War Department to bomb the crematoria at Auschwitz, August 9, 1944. The War Department turns down the request (August 14, 1944).|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 1944, at the War Emergency Conference held in [[Atlantic City]], USA, the WJC elaborated a program for the post-war period, which included calls for reparations from Germany to Jews and the use of heirless Jewish property for Jewish rehabilitation. Also at that conference, [[Stephen S. Wise]] was elected president of the World Jewish Congress. Delegates decided to embark on a $10,000,000 fund-raising effort for relief and increased political activity throughout the world. The news agency JTA also reported the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The closing session of the conference also adopted a resolution recommending that the Congress establish a Department of Community Service which would be charged with aiding in the reconstruction of the spiritual and cultural life of Jews in liberated countries. Another resolution extended the gratitude of the gathering to the Vatican and to the Governments of Spain, Sweden and Switzerland for the protection they offered under difficult conditions to the persecuted Jews in German-dominated Europe. At the same time, it expressed regret at the fact that 'deplorably little has been done to have Axis civilians under the power of the United Nations exchanged for Jews in ghettos, internment, concentration and labor camps.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.jta.org/article/1944/12/03/2865512/world-jewish-congress-10000000-drive-no-challenge-to-other-groups-leaders-say|World Jewish Congress $10,000,000 Drive No Challenge to Other Groups, Leaders Say], Publisher:JTA, Date: 1944-12-03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Meeting of WJC representative with SS leader Heinrich Himmler====
In February 1945, the head of the Swedish office of the WJC, Hilel Storch, established contact through an intermediary with SS chief [[Heinrich Himmler]].&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 190-191&lt;/ref&gt; In April, [[Norbert Masur]] of the Swedish Section of the WJC secretly met with Himmler at Harzfeld, around 70 kilometers north of Berlin. Masur had been promised safe conduct by Himmler. Through negotiations with the Nazi leader and the subsequent talks with the head of the Swedish Red Cross, [[Folke Bernadotte]], the WJC was allowed to save 4,500 inmates from the women's concentration camp at Ravensbrück. Approximately half of these women, who had been deported to Germany from over forty countries, were Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Fox, [http://www.zwoje-scrolls.com/zwoje38/text18p.htm 'A Jew Talks to Himmler'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110174719/http://www.zwoje-scrolls.com/zwoje38/text18p.htm |date=2012-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-war efforts====
At the end of the war, the WJC undertook efforts to rebuild Jewish communities in Europe, pushed for indemnification and reparation claims against Germany, provided assistance to displaced persons and survivors of the Holocaust, and advocated for the punishment of Nazi leaders for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The World Jewish Congress notably took part in the formulation of the principles governing the [[Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal]] and furnished evidence against Nazi leaders to the US prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, pp. 20-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/nuremberg/documents/index.php?documentdate=1945-06-12&amp;documentid=C106-16-5&amp;studycollectionid=&amp;pagenumber=1y|title=Truman Library: Minutes, Meeting of World Jewish Congress with Robert H.

[[File:1948 World Jewish Congress Montreux - 2.jpg|thumb|Stephen Wise addresses World Jewish Congress Plenary Assembly in Montreux, [[Switzerland]], August 1948]]
On 19 August 1945, a conference of representatives of European Jews was organized in Paris, France by the WJC, whose leadership (Wise, Goldmann, Kubowitzki) traveled there from the US. Delegates from Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland attended the gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1945/07/23/2867727/jews-of-western-europe-to-meet-in-paris-delegates-from-seven-countries-expected|title=Jews of Western Europe to Meet in Paris; Delegates from Seven Countries Expected|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September 1945, [[Pope Pius XII]] received WJC Secretary General Leon Kubowitzki in audience, who recounted to the pope the "great losses" suffered by the Jews during the war and expressed gratitude for what the church had done to help "our persecuted people." Kubowitzki suggested a papal encyclical on the Catholic Church's attitude toward the Jews and a condemnation of anti-Semitism. "We will consider it," Pius XII reportedly replied, adding: "certainly, most favorably, with all our love." The WJC also urged the Vatican to assist in the recovery of Jewish children saved by Catholics during the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Marrus, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1252/is_1_133/ai_n26741974/pg_2 "The missing: the Holocaust, the Church &amp; Jewish orphans"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC also supported the foundation of the [[United Nations]] Organization in 1945. In 1947, the organization became one of the first NGOs to be granted [[consultative status]] with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/about|title=About Us|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|website=www.worldjewishcongress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, an estimated 30,000 people attended the opening of the Latin American Conference of the World Jewish Congress at [[Luna Park, Buenos Aires]], Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1947/06/30/3010696/80000-at-opening-of-latinamerican-parley-of-world-jewish-congress-in-buenos-aires|title=30,000 at Opening of Latin American Parley of World Jewish Congress in Buenos Aires, JTA, 30 June 1947|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WJC and the creation of the State of Israel===
Although its principal purpose was to defend the rights of Jews in the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]], the WJC always actively supported the aims of [[Zionism]], i.e. creation of a [[Jewish National Home]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The [[Yishuv]], the Jewish community in British Mandatory Palestine, was represented at the First Plenary Assembly of the WJC in 1936, which affirmed in a resolution "the determination of the Jewish people to live in peaceful cooperation with their Arab neighbors on the basis of mutual respect for the rights of each."&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, in a memorandum to the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]] on Palestine drafted by WJC Political Secretary Alexander L. Easterman, the WJC declared that "the only hope of reviving the life and culture of the Jewish people lies in the establishment of a fully self-governing Jewish Homeland, recognised as such throughout the world; that is, a Jewish Commonwealth in Palestine."&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

WJC officials lobbied UN member states in favor of the adoption of [[UN General Assembly]] Resolution 181 of 1947, which called for the creation of a Jewish and an Arab state in Palestine. On 15 May 1948, the day of Israel's proclamation of independence, the WJC Executive pledged "world Jewry's solidarity" with the fledgling Jewish state. In Montreux, Switzerland, delegates from 34 countries attended the Second Plenary Assembly of the World Jewish Congress, held from 27 June to 6 July 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, pp. 26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiations with Germany on reparations and compensation===
In 1949, the World Jewish Congress called on the newly established [[Federal Republic of Germany]] to acknowledge responsibility and liability of the German people for the wrongs inflicted on the Jewish people by the Nazi regime. In 1950, the WJC opened an office in Frankfurt to function as a "listening post" on developments in Germany. In representations to the United States, Britain and France, the WJC detailed Jewish moral and material claims on Germany. In 1951, [[Nahum Goldmann]], at the request of the Israeli government, established the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany ([[Claims Conference]]).&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, in a declaration approved by the parliament, West German Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] recognized Germany's duty to make moral and material restitution to the Jewish people and signaled its readiness to engage in negotiations with Jewish representatives and the State of Israel. "Unspeakable crimes have been committed in the name of the German people, calling for moral and material indemnity [ ... ] The Federal Government are prepared, jointly with representatives of Jewry and the State of Israel [ ... ] to bring about a solution of the material indemnity problem, thus easing the way to the spiritual settlement of infinite suffering," Adenauer said.&lt;ref name="History of the Claims Conference"&gt;[http://www.claimscon.org/?url=history History of the Claims Conference] Retrieved June 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 1952, WJC and Claims Conference head [[Nahum Goldmann]] and the West German federal government signed an agreement embodied in two protocols. Protocol No. 1 called for the enactment of laws that would compensate Nazi victims directly for indemnification and restitution claims arising from Nazi persecution. Under Protocol No. 2, the West German government provided the Claims Conference with 450 million deutschmarks for the relief, rehabilitation and resettlement of Jewish victims of Nazi persecution. Similar agreements were also signed with the [[Israel|State of Israel]].

Subsequent to these agreements, the Claims Conference continued to negotiate with the German government for amendments to the various legislative commitments and monitored the implementation of the various compensation and restitution laws. According to the Claims Conference, more than 278,000 Jewish Holocaust survivors received lifetime pensions under the German Federal Indemnification Laws. Germany expended a total of US$60 billion in satisfaction of Jewish claims.&lt;ref name="History of the Claims Conference"/&gt;

In 1952, the World Jewish Congress called on the Austrian government to intensify efforts for the restitution of heirless Jewish property. Austrian Chancellor [[Leopold Figl]] subsequently pledged to remedy Jewish grievances.&lt;ref name="Garai, p. 34"&gt;Garai, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Third Plenary Assembly in Geneva (4 to 11 August 1953), [[Nahum Goldmann]] was elected president of the World Jewish Congress, having previously served as acting president.&lt;ref name="Garai, p. 34"/&gt;

===WJC efforts on behalf of Soviet Jewry===
Although the [[Soviet Union]] initially supported the creation of the [[State of Israel]], during the 1950s the Jewish state emerged as part of the Western camp, and Zionism raised fears of internal dissent and opposition among the Communist leadership.

During the later part of the Cold War, Soviet Jews were suspected of being traitors, Western sympathizers, or security liabilities. The Communist leadership closed down various Jewish organizations and declared Zionism an ideological enemy. Synagogues were often placed under police surveillance, both openly and through the use of informers. As a result of the persecution, both state-sponsored and unofficial, anti-Semitism became deeply ingrained in the society and remained a fact for years. The Soviet media, when depicting political events, sometimes used the term 'fascism' to characterize Israeli nationalism. Jews often suffered hardships, epitomized by often not being allowed to enlist in universities, work in certain professions, or participate in government. Many Jews felt compelled to hide their identities by changing their names.

[[File:World Jewish Congress - Third Plenary Assembly - Geneva 1953.jpg|thumb|Third Plenary Assembly of the World Jewish Congress, Geneva, Switzerland, 4–11 August 1953]]
In 1953, the World Jewish Congress condemned the indictment in Moscow of Jewish doctors as alleged conspirators against the Soviet Union leadership, the so-called [[Doctors' plot]], and called a leadership meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, which was canceled at the last minute due to the death of Soviet dictator [[Joseph Stalin]]. The new Soviet leadership declared that the case against the doctors had been fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;Garai&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, WJC leaders delivered a memorandum to Soviet leaders [[Nikolai Bulganin]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] during their visit to London, and a year later the World Jewish Congress Executive launched a worldwide call to attention regarding the plight of Jews in the Soviet Union and other Communist countries. This resulted in a growing international campaign for their cultural and religious rights and for the reunion of families separated by the Cold War. After a lapse of seven years, the organization also re-established contact with several Jewish communities in Communist Eastern Europe. In 1957, the Jewish community of Hungary re-affiliated with the WJC.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, the WJC convoked the International Conference on Soviet Jewry in Paris, which was chaired by Goldmann. In 1971, the WJC co-sponsored the First World Conference of Jewish Communities on Soviet Jewry in Brussels, Belgium. Successor events were held in Brussels and Zurich in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, pp. 36-52&lt;/ref&gt;

At the second Brussels conference, Jewish leaders called on the Soviet Union to implement the [[Declaration of Helsinki]] on human rights, respect its own constitution and laws and "recognize and respect the right of Jews in the USSR to be united with their brethren in the Land of Israel, the Jewish historic homeland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1976/02/20/2974589/brussels-ii-ends-with-call-on-ussr-to-implement-helsinki-declaration-recognize-rights-of-jews-to-be-reunited-with-brethren-in-israel|title=Brussels II Ends with Call on USSR to Implement Helsinki Declaration, Recognize Rights of Jews to Be, JTA, 20 February 1976|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the motto, 'Let my people go!, the Soviet Jewry movement caught the attention of statesmen and public figures throughout the West, who considered the Soviet Union's policy toward Jews to be in violation of basic human and civil rights such as freedom of immigration, freedom of religion, and the freedom to study one's own language, culture and heritage. "You have no choice but to release Soviet Jewry," US President [[Ronald Reagan]] told Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] during the latter's first state visit to the US in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sovietjewry.org/history.php |title=Soviet Jewry Movement Marks Anniversaries |publisher=Sovietjewry.org |date=2007-10-30 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Edgar Bronfman suggested that "American Jews should abandon their strongest weapon, the Jackson–Vanik amendment, as a sign of goodwill that challenges the Soviets to respond in kind."

After [Mikhail Gorbachev]'s ascension in 1985, Bronfman's New York Times message began to resonate with the public. In early 1985, Bronfman secured an invitation to the Kremlin and on September 8–11, visited Moscow, becoming the first World Jewish Congress President to be formally received in Moscow by Soviet Officials. Carrying a note from Shimon Peres, Bronfman met with Gorbachev, and initiated talks of a Soviet Jewish airlift. It is said that Peres' note called on the Soviet Union to resume diplomatic relations with Israel.

In a Washington Post profile a few months after the September trip, Bronfman laid out what he thought had been accomplished during his September meetings. He said, "There's going to be a buildup of pressure through the business community. The Russians know the Soviet Jewry issue is tied to trade ... My guess is that over a period of time, five to ten years, some of our goals will be achieved." Author Gal Beckerman says in his When They Come For Us We'll Be Gone, "Bronfman had a business man's understanding of the Soviet Jewish issue. It was all a matter of negotiation, of calculating what the Russians really wanted and leveraging that against emigration."

On 25 March 1987, WJC leaders [[Edgar Bronfman, Sr.|Edgar M. Bronfman]], [[Israel Singer]], [[Sol Kanee]] and Elan Steinberg, as well as the head of the [[Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations]], [[Morris B. Abram]], arrived in Moscow to discuss the matter with Soviet government ministers, though officials swiftly denied that the USSR had agreed to an increase in Jewish emigration and had invited an Israeli delegation to visit Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-03/news/mn-2416_1_emigration|title=Moscow Denies Shift on Jews or Israel Policy|first=From Times Wire|last=Services|date=3 April 1987|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the visits by WJC officials to Moscow were widely seen as helpful in securing the exit permits for prominent Jews in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="jewishpost.com"&gt;Gad Nahson, [http://www.jewishpost.com/archives/news/edgar-m-bronfman-the-making-of-a-jew.html EDGAR M. BRONFMAN "THE MAKING OF A JEW"], Jewish Post, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Soviet Jewish organizations were granted permission by the authorities to join the World Jewish Congress,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/04/world/soviet-jews-to-join-world-congress.html "Soviet Jews to Join World Congress"], New York Times, 4 January 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and two years later in Jerusalem, several directly elected delegates from the Soviet Union were officially represented for the first time at a World Jewish Congress Plenary Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.jta.org/article/1991/05/07/2874728/soviet-jews-fill-empty-chair-at-wjc-assembly-in-jerusalem "Soviet Jews Fill ‘empty Chair’ at Wjc Assembly in Jerusalem"], JTA, 7 May 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

===Securing the rights of Jews in North Africa and the Middle East===
In the aftermath of World War II and the establishment of the State of Israel, the World Jewish Congress was actively involved in assisting Jews in Arab and other Muslim countries, who had come under increasing pressure. In January 1948, WJC President Stephen Wise, appealed to US Secretary of State George Marshall: "Between 800,000 and a million Jews in the Middle East and North Africa, exclusive of Palestine, are in 'the greatest danger of destruction' at the hands of Muslims being incited to holy war over the Partition of Palestine ... Acts of violence already perpetrated, together with those contemplated, being clearly aimed at the total destruction of the Jews, constitute genocide, which under the resolutions of the General Assembly is a crime against humanity." The United States, however, did not take any follow-up action to investigate these pleadings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/jewref.html|title=Jewish Virtual Library-Jewish Refugees from Arab Countries|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:World Jewish Congress North African Conference, Algiers, June 1952.jpg|thumb|left|World Jewish Congress conference on the situation of Jews in North Africa, Algiers, 1952]]The WJC also submitted a memorandum on the problem to the UN Economic and Social Council, asking for urgent action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zionism-israel.com/hdoc/Arab_League_Law_Jews.htm|title=Draft Arab League Law Regarding Jews-1947|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memorandum in particular mentioned an [[Arab League]] document which planned to strip Jewish citizens of their rights and belongings as part of a calculated plan. However, when the WJC brought the Arab League document before the ECOSOC, its president Charles H. Malik, a representative of Lebanon to the UN, refused to bring it to the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpolicycenter.org/112/the-forgotten-jewish-refugees-from-arab-states|title=Robert Ivker, The Forgotten Jewish Refugees From Arab States, 2008|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s, the WJC conducted negotiations with a number of Arab governments, notably in North Africa, and pleaded with them to allow their Jewish populations to leave their native countries. With the advance of Arab nationalism, especially during the 1950s, these efforts were increasingly complicated. In 1954, a WJC delegation visited Morocco, then still under French colonial rule.

The WJC leadership also kept in close touch with the leaders of the Moroccan independence movement, including the exiled sultan of Morocco, Mohammed V, who insisted that an autonomous Morocco would guarantee the freedom and equality of all its citizens, including access of non-Muslims to public administration.&lt;ref&gt;Jews in the new North African states, Report submitted to the Fourth Plenary Assembly of the World Jewish Congress by the directors of the Political and International Affairs Departments, A. L. Easterman and Dr. M.L. Perlzweig, in: World Jewry, 1959, p.12-13 and p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; When Morocco became independent from France in 1956, WJC Political Director Alex Easterman immediately began negotiations with Prime Minister [[Mbarek Bekkay]] and other government officials, pressing them to grant Jews the right to leave.

Whilst in 1957 an agreement was reached to allow for the emigration of all 8,000 Jews from Mazagan that were held in a refugee camp near [[Casablanca]],&lt;ref name="Gerhart M.

===1950s-1980s===
Delegates from 43 countries attended the Fourth WJC Plenary Assembly held in Stockholm in 1959.

In 1960, the WJC convoked a special conference in Brussels following a series of anti-Semitic incidents in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Congress in Action – Chronicle of forty years, in: George Garai (ed.), World Jewish Congress, 40 Years in Action 1936-1976, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1966, the speaker of the West German parliament, [[Eugen Gerstenmaier]], delivered an address titled, 'Germans and Jews – A Problem Unresolved' to the Fifth Plenary Assembly in Brussels, Belgium, becoming the first senior German politician to address a WJC conference, which caused some controversy within the WJC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19660802&amp;id=cNsjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1ycEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3126,329372|title=Milwaukee Journal, 2 August 1966, p.3|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some delegates from Israel boycotted the session with Gerstenmaier in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1966/08/02/3085139/mapam-and-her-ut-to-boycott-wjc-symposium-on-germans-and-jews|title=Mapam and Herut to Boycott WJC Symposium on ‘Germans and Jews’ - JTA, 2 August 1966|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the American Section of the WJC was set up to broaden the organization's constituency in the country with the biggest Jewish community worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Congress in Action – Chronicle of forty years, in: George Garai (ed.), World Jewish Congress, 40 Years in Action 1936-1976, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] affiliated with the World Jewish Congress. The British Section of the WJC, which had previously represented UK Jewry, was dissolved.

To emphasize its solidarity with the State of Israel, the WJC held its Sixth Plenary Assembly in 1975 for the first time in Jerusalem, and with one exception, all plenary assemblies have since been held there. The delegates also adopted new statutes and a new structure for the organization, and the WJC entered into a cooperation agreement with the [[World Zionist Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Congress in Action – Chronicle of forty years, in: George Garai (ed.), World Jewish Congress, 40 Years in Action 1936-1976, p. 56-58&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Jewish Congress was vocal in efforts to repeal [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379]], which was adopted on November 10, 1975 and held "that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;''Moynihan's Moment: America's Fight Against Zionism as Racism'', Gil Troy, Oxford University Press, 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-19-992030-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC Executive characterized the resolution as an "attempt to defame Zionism by equating it with imperialism, colonialism, racism, and apartheid, […] amounting to incitement to racism and racial hatred." All communities and organizations affiliated to the Congress were urged to take immediate action to mobilize public opinion against the resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Activities of the World Jewish Congress, February 1975-October 1977, Report of the Secretary-General to the General Council of the World Jewish Congress at its meeting in Washington, October 30 – November 3, 1977, Geneva, October 1977, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Israel made revocation of Resolution 3379 a condition of its participation in the [[Madrid Conference of 1991|Madrid Peace Conference]] of 1991. Resolution 3379 was revoked in 1991 by UN General Assembly Resolution 4686.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the WJC also campaigned for an end to the [[Arab boycott of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.jta.org/article/1975/10/14/2973350/wjc-committee-on-arab-boycott-will-focus-on-international-pacts "WJC Committee on Arab Boycott Will Focus on International Pacts"], JTA, 14 October 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

====Leadership changes====
At the WJC Plenary in 1975, longtime WJC leader [[Nahum Goldmann]] (then 80) stood again for WJC president. Several Israeli delegates, notably from the [[Herut]] movement, but also former Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]], opposed Goldmann's re-election for his criticism of Israel's policies, notably with respect to the peace process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1975/01/08/2970955/herut-seeking-to-prevent-reelection-of-goldmann-as-wjc-president|title=Herut Seeking to Prevent Re-election of Goldmann As WJC President - JTA, 8 January 1975|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1975/02/10/2970825/goldmann-reelected-wjc-president-despite-bitter-herut-opposition|title=Goldmann Re-elected Wjc President Despite Bitter Herut Opposition - JTA, 10 February 1975|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seated on the right: Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]]]]Two years later, in 1977, the American real estate developer and erstwhile president of [[B'nai B'rith]] International [[Philip Klutznick]] succeeded Goldmann as WJC president. In 1979, when Klutznick was named US secretary of commerce by President [[Jimmy Carter]], the Canadian-American businessman [[Edgar Bronfman Sr.]] took over as acting head of the organization. Bronfman was formally elected WJC president by the Seventh Plenary Assembly, held in Jerusalem in January 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/01/world/bronfman-heads-jewish-congress.html?scp=2&amp;sq=edgar+bronfman&amp;st=nyt "Bronfman Heads Jewish Congress"], New York Times, 1 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Edgar M. Bronfman=====
Under the leadership of Bronfman, the new Secretary General [[Israel Singer]] (who took over from [[Gerhart Riegner]] in 1983), and Executive Director Elan Steinberg, the WJC adopted a more aggressive style. Steinberg characterized the change as follows: "For a long time, the World Jewish Congress was meant to be the greatest secret of Jewish life, because the nature of diplomacy after the war was quiet diplomacy. This is a newer, American-style leadership — less timid, more forceful, unashamedly Jewish."&lt;ref name="jewishpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishledger.com/2012/04/elan-steinberg-advocated-for-holocaust-survivors-around-the-world "Elan Steinberg advocated for Holocaust survivors around the world"], Jewish Ledger, 10 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  
Bronfman led the World Jewish Congress in becoming the preeminent Jewish organization, as they broadened the organization's base by bringing in new member communities in Europe. Through campaigns to free Soviet Jewry, the exposure of the Nazi past of Austrian President Kurt Waldheim, and the campaign to compensate victims of the Holocaust, Bronfman became well known internationally in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jewish Philanthropist Edgar Bronfman Passes Away at 84 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Edgar-Bronfman-passes-away-at-84-335767 |accessdate=April 29, 2014|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 1982, WJC President Edgar Bronfman became the first leader ever of a Jewish organization to address the United Nations General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.jta.org/article/1982/05/24/2993642/wjc-to-be-the-only-jewish-ngo-to-address-un-assemblys-special-session-on-disarmament "WJC to Be the Only Jewish NGO to Address UN Assembly’s Special Session on Disarmament"], JTA, 24 May 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy over Catholic convent's presence at Auschwitz====
In 1985, [[Carmelites|Carmelite nuns]] opened a convent near the site of the former Nazi death camp [[Auschwitz]] I. WJC President Edgar Bronfman called for the removal of the convent. In public statements, other Jewish leaders, including former WJC Secretary General [[Gerhart Riegner]], also called for the removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1986/01/13/3003376/plan-to-build-convent-on-site-of-auschwitz-death-camp-sparks-anger-among-european-jewish-communities|title=Plan to Build Convent on Site of Auschwitz Death Camp Sparks Anger Among European Jewish Communities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, the Catholic Church agreed to those requests and said the convent would be removed within two years.

However, the Carmelites stayed put, and a year later erected a large cross from a 1979 mass with the Pope near their site. The World Jewish Congress Executive strongly urged the Vatican to take action against the convent's presence and said [[Pope John Paul II]] should "exercise his authority" to order the prompt removal of convent and cross. The WJC Executive said the pontiff's action was necessary to implement the agreement major European Catholic cardinals, including the cardinal of Kraków, Franciszek Macharski, had signed with Jewish leaders on 22 February 1987 in Geneva. Edgar Bronfman declared: "It is not only a matter of the Auschwitz convent, but the broader implications of historical revisionism in which the uniqueness of the Holocaust and the murder of the Jewish people is being suppressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1989/05/11/2870284/wjc-urges-pope-to-use-authority-to-remove-convent-from-auschwitz|title=Wjc Urges Pope to Use Authority to Remove Convent from Auschwitz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months later, the Carmelites were ordered by Rome to move. The WJC praised the Vatican for taking action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1989/09/20/2871143/vatican-praised-for-offer-to-help-relocate-the-convent-at-auschwitz|title=Vatican Praised for Offer to Help Relocate the Convent at Auschwitz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the nuns remained on the site until 1993, leaving the large cross behind.

====Diplomatic contacts with Communist countries====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1988-1017-018, Berlin, Bronfman-Besuch.jpg|thumb|left|Meeting of a WJC delegation led by Edgar Bronfman with GDR leader [[Erich Honecker]], in East Berlin, October 1988]]

During the mid-1980s, the World Jewish Congress also entered into diplomatic talks with several Central and Eastern European countries, notably Communist East Germany, whose leadership the WJC urged to recognize its obligations to Jewish victims of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/27-5-16.shtml "THE GDR OFFERS "SYMBOLIC" COMPENSATION TO JEWISH VICTIMS OF NAZISM"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095417/http://osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/27-5-16.shtml |date=2016-03-10 }}, Radio Free Europe, 20 October 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1990, GDR Prime Minister [[Hans Modrow]] sent a letter to WJC President Edgar Bronfman in which he recognized on behalf of the East German government the GDR's responsibility for German crimes committed against the Jewish people under the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;Holocauste: L'Est avoue - Libération, 9 February 1990, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement, Modrow said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The German Democratic Republic stands unalterably by its duty to do everything against racism, Nazism, anti-Semitism, and hatred among peoples, so that, in the future, war and fascism will never again start from German soil, but only peace and understanding among people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1990_682891/e-germany-agrees-to-pay-reparations-for-crimes-aga.html|title=E. Germany agrees to pay reparations for crimes against Jews, Houston Chronicle, 9 February 1990|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A few weeks later, the first freely elected parliament of the GDR, the ''[[Volkskammer]]'', passed a resolution which recognized the GDR's responsibility for the Holocaust and asked "Jews around the world for forgiveness". The GDR pledged to compensate for material damages to Jews and to safeguard Jewish traditions. The resolution became part of the [[German reunification]] treaty and continues to be part of German law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compass-infodienst.de/Konrad_Weiss__Antisemitismus_und_Israelfeindschaft_in_der_DDR.1452.0.html#referenz_15|title=04.12.2017 - Nr. 1756|website=www.compass-infodienst.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the World Jewish Congress held a meeting of its Executive Committee in Budapest, Hungary, the first WJC gathering in Communist Eastern Europe since the end of World War II. The Hungarian government had accepted that there would to be no restrictions to the attendance of Israeli delegates or the subjects of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/07/world/a-jewish-parley-in-budapest.html "A JEWISH PARLEY IN BUDAPEST"], New York Times, 7 May 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

====Waldheim affair====
In 1986, the World Jewish Congress alleged that Austrian presidential candidate [[Kurt Waldheim]], a former secretary general of the [[United Nations]], had lied about his service as an officer in the mounted corps of the Nazi Party "[[Sturmabteilung]]" (SA), and his time as German ordnance officer in Thessaloniki, Greece, from 1942 to 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/04/world/files-show-kurt-waldheim-served-under-war-criminal.html?scp=1&amp;sq=waldheim+nazi+world+jewish+congress&amp;st=nyt |title=FILES SHOW KURT WALDHEIM SERVED UNDER WAR CRIMINAL |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date=4 March 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waldheim called the allegations "pure lies and malicious acts". In a telex to Bronfman, he said that his past had been "deliberately misinterpreted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/08/world/waldheim-says-reports-on-past-are-unfounded.html?scp=5&amp;sq=waldheim+nazi+world+jewish+congress&amp;st=nyt |title=WALDHEIM SAYS HIS PAST WAS MISREPRESENTED |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date=6 March 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he admitted that he had known about German reprisals against partisans: "Yes, I knew. I was horrified. But what could I do? I had either to continue to serve or be executed." He said that he had never fired a shot or even seen a partisan. His former immediate superior at the time stated that Waldheim had "remained confined to a desk".

Former Austrian Jewish chancellor [[Bruno Kreisky]] called the World Jewish Congress's actions an "extraordinary infamy" adding that in election, Austrians "won't allow the Jews abroad to order us about and tell us who should be our President."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/04/world/around-the-world-ex-chancellor-voices-criticism-of-waldheim.html "EX-CHANCELLOR VOICES CRITICISM OF WALDHEIM"], [[New York Times]], 4 April 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

In view of the ongoing international controversy, the Austrian government decided to appoint an international committee of historians to examine Waldheim's life between 1938 and 1945. Their report found no evidence of any personal involvement of Waldheim in those crimes. At the same time, although he had stated that he was unaware of any crimes taking place, the historians cited evidence that Waldheim must have known about war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Wiesenthal "The Waldheim Case" in ''Contemporary Jewish Writing in Austria'' edited by Dagmar Lorenz. pp 81-95, University of Nebraska press&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his term as president (1986–1992), Waldheim and his wife Elisabeth were officially deemed "[[personae non gratae]]" by the United States. They could visit only Arab countries and the [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL2351006420070623?pageNumber=2 "Waldheim, ex-UN leader and Nazi, buried in Austria"] Reuters, 23 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2007/jun2007/wald-j21.shtml|title=Kurt Waldheim (1918-2007)|first=Dietmar|last=Henning|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, they were put on a watch list of persons banned from entering the United States and remained on the list even after the publication of the International Committee of Historians' report on his military past in the [[Wehrmacht]].

On May 5, 1987, Bronfman spoke to the World Jewish Congress saying Waldheim was "part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine". Waldheim subsequently filed a lawsuit against Bronfman, but dropped the suit shortly after due to a lack of evidence in his favor.

===Restitution of Holocaust-era assets and compensation payments===
In 1992, the World Jewish Congress established the World Jewish Restitution Organization (WJRO), an umbrella body of Jewish organizations and including the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]]. Its purpose is to pursue the restitution of Jewish property in Europe, outside Germany (which is dealt with by the [[Claims Conference]]). According to its website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wjro.org.il/Web/AboutUs/Mission/Default.aspx|title=World Jewish Restitution Organization – Our Mission|publisher=|access-date=2012-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610231419/http://wjro.org.il/Web/AboutUs/Mission/Default.aspx|archive-date=2012-06-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the WRJO's mission is to consult and negotiate "with national and local governments to conclude agreements and ensure legislation concerning the restitution of property to the Jewish people", to conduct "research on Jewish property in national and local archives and to establish a central data bank in which information on Jewish communal property will be recorded and assembled, and to allocate "funds for the preservation of Jewish cultural and educational projects in that country. To date, such funds have been establishes in Poland, Romania and Hungary." Current World Jewish Congress President [[Ronald S. Lauder]] is chairman of the WRJO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wjro.org.il/Web/AboutUs/Council/Default.aspx|title=World Jewish Restitution Organization – Council Representatives|publisher=|access-date=2012-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630164329/http://wjro.org.il/Web/AboutUs/Council/Default.aspx|archive-date=2012-06-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Swiss bank settlement====
{{See also|World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss banks|Bergier Commission}}
In the late 1990s, as President of the WJC, Edgar Bronfman championed the cause of restitution from Switzerland for Holocaust survivors. Bronfman began an initiative that led to the $1.25 billion settlement from Swiss banks, aiming to resolve claims "that the Swiss hoarded bank accounts opened by Jews who were murdered by the Nazis".

In total, the WJC, the [[Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany]], the World Jewish Restitution Organization, and the [[International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims]], founded in 1998, have secured millions of dollars for the victims and survivors of the Holocaust in payments from Germany, [[World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss Banks|Swiss banks]], Insurances and other parties totaling $20 billion.&lt;ref name=buncombe&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=597158 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305083349/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=597158 |date=March 5, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/838311.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edgar M Bronfman 1989.jpg|thumb|[[Edgar Bronfman, Sr.|Edgar M. Bronfman]]]]
In 1995, the WJC initiated negotiations on behalf of various Jewish organizations with Swiss banks and the government of [[Switzerland]] over so-called dormant [[World War II]]-era bank accounts of [[Holocaust]] victims. The WJC entered a [[class-action lawsuit]] in Brooklyn, NY alleging that Holocaust victims and their families faced improper barriers to accessing WWII-era Swiss bank accounts because of requirements such as death certificates (typically non-existent for Holocaust victims), and that some Swiss banks made deliberate efforts to retain the account balances indefinitely. The claims also included the value of art works purported to have been stolen, "damages" to persons denied admission to Switzerland on the strength of refugee applications, and the value or cost of labor purported to have been performed by persons being maintained at Swiss government expense in displaced-person camps during the Holocaust, along with interest on such claims from the time of loss. The WJC marshaled the support of US government officials including New York Senator Alfonse D'Amato, who held hearings of the Senate Banking Committee on the topic and claimed that "hundreds of millions of dollars" of WWII-era Jewish assets remained in Swiss banks. At the behest of US President [[Bill Clinton]], Undersecretary of Commerce [[Stuart Eizenstat]] testified at these hearings that Swiss banks knowingly purchased looted gold from the Nazis during WWII. Eizenstat was later named special envoy of the US government for Holocaust issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://banking.senate.gov/97_05hrg/051597/witness/eizenst.htm Hearings before the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301040526/http://banking.senate.gov/97_05hrg/051597/witness/eizenst.htm |date=2007-03-01 }}, May 15, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The report relied exclusively on US government archives. It contained no new historical information on Nazi victims' deposits into Swiss banks, and criticized the decisions of US officials who negotiated settlements with Switzerland after the war as being too lenient.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart E. Eizenstat, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, Special Envoy of the Department of State on Property Restitution in Central and Eastern Europe,[http://www.ushmm.org/assets/state/index.html "U.S. and Allied Efforts To Recover and Restore Gold and Other Assets Stolen or Hidden by Germany During World War II"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101094622/http://www.ushmm.org/assets/state/index.html |date=2007-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nazis/etc/cron.html|title=A Chronology of Events Surrounding the Lost Assets of Victims of Nazi Germany|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audits ordered by the Swiss government of dormant accounts between 1962 and 1995 showed a total of US $32 million (in 1995 terms) in unclaimed war-era accounts. However, during the negotiations, the Swiss banks agreed to commission another audit of wartime accounts, headed by former US [[Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Paul Volcker]]. The Volcker Commission report concluded that the 1999 book value of all dormant accounts possibly belonging to victims of Nazi persecution that were unclaimed, closed by the Nazis or closed by unknown persons was CHF 95 million. Of this total, CHF 24 million were "probably" related to victims of Nazi persecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crt-ii.org/ICEP/ICEP_Report_ToC.pdf "Report on Dormant Accounts of Victims of Nazi Persecution in Swiss Banks"], Annex 4; and Part I paragraph 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nazis/etc/cron.html|title="A Chronology of Events Surrounding the Lost Assets of Victims of Nazi Germany"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission recommended that for settlement purposes, the book values should be modified back to 1945 values (by adding back fees paid and subtracting interest) and then be multiplied by 10 to reflect average long-term investment rates in Switzerland.
On 12 August 1998, several major Swiss banks agreed to pay Holocaust survivors and their relatives more than US$1.25 billion over the following three years. As part of the settlement, the plaintiffs agreed to drop a lawsuit against the Government-owned Swiss National Bank in US courts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Nazi gold====
In 1997, a study commissioned by the World Jewish Congress concluded that Nazi Germany had looted at least US $8.5 billion in gold between 1933 and 1945 from Jews and other victims. The study estimated that a third of the gold had come from individuals and private businesses rather than central banks and that over US $2 billion of privately owned gold eventually ended up in Swiss banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/07/world/a-price-tag-of-billions-in-nazi-gold.html|title=A Price Tag Of Billions In Nazi Gold|first=David E.|last=Sanger|date=7 October 1997|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland rejected the WJC accusations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/08/world/world-news-briefs-swiss-reject-finding-of-3-billion-gold-debt.html?scp=10&amp;sq=world+jewish+congress+nazi+gold&amp;st=nyt "Swiss Reject Finding Of $3 Billion Gold Debt"], [[New York Times]], 8 October 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In response to inquiries from the World Jewish Congress, the US [[Federal Reserve Bank]] admitted in 1997 that personal gold seized by the Nazis was melted into gold bars after the war and then shipped as gold bullion to the central banks of four European countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/7177/u-s-admits-to-melting-gold-of-nazi-victims "U.S. admits to melting gold of Nazi victims"], New York Jewish Week, 5 December 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Sweden also opened an investigation into assertions by the World Jewish Congress that looted Nazi gold from World War II had been deposited in Swedish government bank vaults.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/21/world/sweden-to-investigate-assertions-of-nazi-gold.html?scp=1&amp;sq=world+jewish+congress+nazi+gold&amp;st=nyt "Sweden to Investigate Assertions of Nazi Gold"], [[New York Times]], 21 December 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

====Agreements with other European countries on Holocaust-era property restitution and compensation====
During the 1990s and 2000s, at the behest of the World Jewish Congress a total of 17 European countries established special committees to look into their role during [[World War II]]. Many set up funds to compensate Jewish and other victims of the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/video/17/70_25_wjc_anniversary_video WJC anniversary video] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825093042/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/video/17/70_25_wjc_anniversary_video |date=2012-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, French Prime Minister [[Alain Juppé]] created a commission to investigate the seizures of Jewish property by the occupying Nazi forces and the French collaborators during the war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nazis/etc/cron.html "A Chronology of Events Surrounding the Lost Assets of Victims of Nazi Germany"] PBS Frontline&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000/2001, the World Jewish Congress helped to negotiate a compensation agreement with the German government and industry under which a €5 billion fund was set up to compensate World War II slave and forced laborers, mainly living Central and Eastern Europe, who had hitherto not received any compensation payments for the suffering under Nazi rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,135530,00.html "NS-Zwangsarbeiter: Erste Zahlungen ab Juni"], Spiegel Online, 23 May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

====Restitution of looted art====
In 1998, the WJC released a list of 2,000 people who allegedly took part in the Nazis' massive looting of art. It named people from 11 countries, including museum curators, gallery owners, art experts and other intermediaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/1998-11-10/world/9811_10_nazi.art_1_nazi-art-french-museums-jewish-collections?_s=PM:WORLD "France publishes catalogue of looted Nazi art"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919114417/http://articles.cnn.com/1998-11-10/world/9811_10_nazi.art_1_nazi-art-french-museums-jewish-collections?_s=PM:WORLD |date=2010-09-19 }}, [[CNN]], 10 November 1998&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, in Washington DC, delegates from 44 countries agreed to set up a central registry on art looted by the Nazis which could be established on the internet.&lt;ref name="archives.cnn.com"&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/STYLE/arts/03/02/holocaust.art.reut "Manhattan museum plans to issue Holocaust looted-art study"], [[CNN]], 2 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald S. Lauder]], then chairman of the WJC Art Recovery Commission, estimated that 110,000 pieces of art worth between US $10 and 30 billion were still missing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/227675.stm "Europe Nazi loot to return to Holocaust victims"], [[BBC News]], 4 December 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the World Jewish Congress criticized museums for waiting for artworks to be claimed by Holocaust victims instead of publicly announcing that they have suspect items.&lt;ref name="archives.cnn.com"/&gt; In the wake of the WJC accusations, a number of countries commissioned investigations into Nazi-looted art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1060451.stm "Canada probes Nazi loot"], [[BBC News]], 8 December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with Poland===
The WJC has evinced a great interest in Poland, both before the war, when the country was home to some 3.25 million Jews (10 percent of that country's total population, forming the largest Jewish community in Europe); and in the post-war period, when the Jewish community was reconstituted. In second half of the 1930s, in the face of a marked rise in antisemitism, the WJC attempted to intervene on behalf of [[Polish Jewry]]. In December 1936, for example, [[Nahum Goldmann]] visited Poland and conferred with the Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Jozef Beck]], but this ''demarche'' did little to abate the situation. In order to counter the drastic affects of the ban on kosher slaughter ([[Shechita]]), the WJC Economic Department prepared a study on the legislation and proposed various relief measures that could be instituted.&lt;ref&gt;Unity in Dispersion, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The WJC also intervened to ensure that Polish Jews deported from Germany at the end of October 1938 and stranded in Zbaszyn would be allowed to resettle elsewhere in Poland.

After the war, when a wave of [[Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944–1946|anti-Jewish violence swept the country]], the WJC prevailed upon the Polish government to remove all obstacles faced by Jews who sought to leave the country and for the most part Jews were able to emigrate unhindered until about 1950. Most left without visas or exit permits thanks to a decree of [[Marian Spychalski|Gen. Spychalski]].&lt;ref name="D-H"&gt;Devorah Hakohen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hCw6v0TFhdMC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=%22Poland+opened+its+gates+to+Jewish+emigration.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vZPlTILoE8uUnAey5NGjDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Poland%20opened%20its%20gates%20to%20Jewish%20emigration.%22&amp;f=false  ''Immigrants in turmoil: mass immigration to Israel and its repercussions...''] Syracuse University Press, 2003 - 325 pages.

[[File:2008 World Jewish Congress Delegation meets with Polish PM Donald Tusk.jpg|thumb|left|A World Jewish Congress delegation meets with Polish Prime Minister [[Donald Tusk]], June 2008]]As the Jewish community dwindled, over successive waves of emigration (the last in 1968), the WJC saw Poland as an important repository of Jewish history as well as the custodians of the killing grounds in which much of European Jewry fell victim to the German Final Solution.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Weinbaum, The Jewish communities in the diaspora and antisemitism in Poland Moreshet: Journal for the Study of the Holocaust and Antisemitism. VI, Spring 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the Polish government and the WJC worked to have Auschwitz placed on the UNESCO World Heritage list as site of genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Klein, The Battle for Auschwitz: Catholic-Jewish Relations Under Strain (London, Vallentine Mitchell, 2001), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The organization repeatedly pressed Poland to ensure that in Auschwitz and other Nazi German death camp sites, the memory of the Jews who had been the main victims, would not be subsumed in collective memory. As such, at the end of the 1980s, the organization was deeply involved in the struggle to have the Carmelite convent that had been established on its ground removed. Rabbi [[David Rosen (rabbi)|David Rosen]] of the Anti-Defamation League noted at the time: "To some extent the WJC did determine the tune. Their style created the atmosphere in which no public Jewish organization could not get involved. Had the WJC not got involved, those issues might not have developed in the way they did."&lt;ref&gt;Emma Klein, The Battle for Auschwitz:P Catholic-Jewish Relations Under Strain (London, Vallentine Mitchell, 2001), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC has consistently lobbied the Polish government to enact legislation that would ensure the restitution of private property seized during the Nazi occupation and later during the Communist regime. In April 1996, during a discussion about the restitution of Jewish communal property that had been seized during the Holocaust, WJC Secretary General [[Israel Singer]], allegedly stated that "More than three million Jews died in Poland, and the Polish people are not going to be the heirs of the Polish Jews. We are never going to allow this. ( ... ) They're gonna hear from us until Poland freezes over again." If Poland did not satisfy Jewish claims it would be "publicly attacked and humiliated" in the international forum, Singer said according to a Reuters report.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish group threatens Poland over restitution, Reuters, 19 April 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, President Lauder declared that by prevaricating on the restitution issue Poland was "telling many elderly prewar landowners, including Holocaust survivors, that they have no foreseeable hope of even a small measure of justice for the assets that were seized from them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/news/27993 |title=EJP &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Jewish leader discusses restitution of stolen property with Polish PM |publisher=Ejpress.org |date=2008-06-18 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pursuit of a more nuanced approach to the history of Polish-Jewish relations that includes Jewish recognition of Polish losses suffered during World War II, the WJC's Research Institute published two monographs which explored the attempts to revive [[Polish Jewry]] and the ways in which Poles and Jews have confronted their common history.&lt;ref&gt;Policy Study No. 14 "Polish Jews: A Postscript to the 'Final Chapter'?" (Jerusalem, 1998) and Policy Study No. 22 "The Struggle for Memory in Poland: Auschwitz, Jedwabne and Beyond" (Jerusalem, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Israel Council on Foreign Relations, which operates under the auspices of the World Jewish Congress, together with the Polish Institute for International Affairs, held two successive conferences (one in Warsaw in 2009 and the other in Jerusalem in 2010) to discuss bilateral relations and international issues of mutual concern. At the second gathering the 20th anniversary of the re-establishment of relations between the two countries was marked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Thoughts-on-May-3.|title=Patrycja Sasnal (editor), "Polish-Israeli Foreign Policy Conference: Twenty Years of Bilateral Relations, Jerusalem, 19-20 September, 2010 - Post Conference Reports" PISM (November 2010); Laurence Weinbaum, Thoughts on May 3 - Jerusalem Post, 2 May 2009. |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key policies and activities of the World Jewish Congress==
===Support for Israel===
[[File:Tony Blair - Jerusalem - June 2011.jpg|thumb|left|International Quartet for the Middle East envoy [[Tony Blair]] briefs delegates at the World Jewish Congress Governing Board in Jerusalem on the peace process, June 2011]]
The mission statement of the World Jewish Congress says that the organization seeks "to enhance solidarity among Jewish communities throughout the world and, recognizing the centrality of the State of Israel to contemporary Jewish identity, to strengthen the bonds of Jewish communities and Jews in the Diaspora with Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/889d69aea1ad8f09311d85d33e42e71ed41ef626.pdf+|title=World Jewish Congress|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|website=www.worldjewishcongress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fighting the delegitimization of Israel====
The WJC recently started to focus its main activity on countering the [[delegitimization of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cbn.com/jerusalemdateline/archive/2010/09/02/exclusive-ron-lauder-on-the-deligitimization-of-israel.aspx%20|title=VIDEO: Ron Lauder on the 'Delegitimization of Israel', CBN News, 2 September 2010|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413111541/http://blogs.cbn.com/jerusalemdateline/archive/2010/09/02/exclusive-ron-lauder-on-the-deligitimization-of-israel.aspx|archive-date=2011-04-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC lobbies international organizations, notably the United Nations, to ensure that governments "apply the same standards to Israel when judging its actions compared with those of other countries."&lt;ref name="WJC &amp; Supporting Israel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/6|title=WJC &amp; Supporting Israel|accessdate=2012-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602122333/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/6|archive-date=2012-06-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WJC states on its website that "Israel should not be singled out for criticism by countries which do not themselves adhere to the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law" and that "Israel needs to be treated fairly in international organizations, especially in [[United Nations]] bodies such as the [[UN Human Rights Council]]."&lt;ref name="WJC &amp; Supporting Israel"/&gt;

In early 2009, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder wrote to UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, [[Navi Pillay]], ahead of the [[Durban Review Conference]], asking that the clauses stigmatizing Israel in the 2001 Durban Declaration and Program of Action be repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/27/idUS145074+27-Mar-2009+PRN20090327%20%20|title=Durban Review Conference: World Jewish Congress Calls for Repeal of 2001 Clauses - WJC Press Release, 27 March 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauder also denounced the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] for issuing what he called a "profoundly unbalanced and biased report" into Israel's raid of the [[Gaza flotilla]] in May 2010. "We note that [the council] has lost its moral compass, where terrorism is deemed activism, and self-defense is called disproportionate violence. If the UNHRC wants to regain the integrity of its original purpose, it cannot submit to being manipulated into justifying and covering up terrorism," the WJC president declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/9595/wjc_condemns_un_human_rights_council_probe_on_flotilla_raid+|title=WJC condemns UN Human Rights Council probe on flotilla raid|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, the World Jewish Congress, together with several Israeli government ministries, convened a consultation entitled 'Building Partnerships and Synergies in Countering the Assault on Israel's Legitimacy' in Jerusalem. It was attended by over 100 professional Jewish leaders from 60 different organizations. The conference identified the need for a collaborative effort on behalf of world Jewry and the State of Israel to advance the protection of Israel's rights and "halt the political and economic assault" against it. Israel's Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], the Minister for Strategic Affairs, [[Moshe Yaalon]], [[Jewish Agency for Israel]] Chairman [[Natan Sharansky]], former Canadian Justice Minister and current member of Parliament [[Irwin Cotler]], Italian lawmaker [[Fiamma Nirenstein]] and international Jewish leaders participated in the consultation, which led to the establishment of the 'Global Coalition for Israel' and the formation of task forces to implement the conclusions reached.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/events/showEvent/id/11 Strategic Consultation - "Building Partnerships and Synergies in Countering the Assault on Israel’s Legitimacy" - WJC website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208142425/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/events/showEvent/id/11 |date=2011-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], the WJC in September 2011 published a policy book entitled 'The Rights of Israel as a Nation-State in International Diplomacy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/news/israel_rights_pdf/Israel_Rights.pdf|title=Israel's Rights as a Nation-State in International Diplomacy - WJC website|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602123855/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/news/israel_rights_pdf/Israel_Rights.pdf|archive-date=2012-06-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book features academic articles by international legal and political experts across the political spectrum, including [[Alan Dershowitz]], [[Ruth Lapidoth]], Stanley Urman, [[Shlomo Avineri]], [[Martin Gilbert]], [[Dan Diker]] and others. The authors outline Israel's historical and legal rights, the plight of the Jewish refugees from Arab countries, and refute all the major claims made against Israel by local and international actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/10701/wjc_analysis_israel_s_rights_as_a_nation_state_in_international_diplomacy_|title=WJC ANALYSIS - Israel's rights as a nation-state in international diplomacy|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, United Nations Secretary General [[António Guterres]] became the first UN chief ever to address a World Jewish Congress gathering and also addressed the issue of bias against Israel. Speaking in New York to the delegates of the WJC Plenary Assembly, Guterres promised to stand up against anti-Israel bias at the world organization and said the Jewish state "must be treated like any other member state." He also stressed that Israel had an "undeniable right to exist and to live in peace and security with its neighbors," and that "the modern form of anti-Semitism is the denial of the existence of the State of Israel." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/un-chief-vows-to-stand-up-against-anti-israel-bias-anti-semitism/|title=UN chief vows to stand up against anti-Israel bias, anti-Semitism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Support for peace process and opposition to Palestinian unilateralism====
The World Jewish Congress has endorsed a [[two-state solution]] to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and is opposed to unilateral actions by either side. It states on its website that "a negotiated settlement between Israel and the Palestinians based on a two-state solution is the only legitimate and just way to provide for a lasting peace. The nascent Palestinian state should respect the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. A Palestinian state can only be founded if it respects Israel's right to exist in security. Initiatives that help to enable the Palestinians to advance economically and socially should also be supported as a means of stabilizing the peace process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/6%20|title=Supporting Israel - WJC website|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520175356/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/6%20|archive-date=2013-05-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the 2011 UN Security Council vote that would have resulted in the success of the Palestinian unilateral bid for statehood, the WJC worked to underscore what it perceived as a dangerous move for Israel, for the sustainability of a future Palestinian state and for peace in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/10709/ronald_s_lauder_on_the_dangers_of_the_palestinian_statehood_motion|title=Ronald S. Lauder on the dangers of the Palestinian statehood motion|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, the World Jewish Congress, together with the [[International Council of Jewish Parliamentarians]], assembled in New York to lobby the international community against allowing the Palestinian Authority's unilateral move to become a full member of the United Nations and bypass negotiations with Israel. At a dinner hosted by WJC President Lauder, the delegation of Jewish parliamentarians engaged in an open discussion with UN ambassadors from key countries including Germany, France, Poland and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icjp.net/events/icjp_steering_committee_meetings_in_new_york_and_washington_d_c_7_8_september_2011/5|title=ICJP - Events|website=www.icjp.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronald Lauder, writing in the German newspaper Die Welt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/debatte/kommentare/article12470166/Warum-Israel-Mitglied-der-Nato-werden-muss.html|title=Verteidigungsbündnis: Warum Israel Mitglied der Nato werden muss|first=Ronald S.|last=Lauder|date=7 February 2011|publisher=|via=www.welt.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; called for Israel to be admitted into the Western alliance [[NATO]]: "Israel needs real guarantees for its security. European NATO member states – including Turkey – must admit the state of Israel into the Western alliance," the WJC president wrote. He referred to the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia and said they were reminders of how "unpredictable" developments in the Middle East were. Israeli NATO membership "would send a strong signal to other countries not to take on Israel", Lauder argued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/world-jewish-congress/44854/call-israel-join-nato Call for Israel to join NATO - Jewish Chronicle, 8 February 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, Lauder reacted "with dismay" at a suggestion by Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Eamon Gilmore to impose a European Union-wide import ban on products made in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which Gilmore said were "illegal" and made peace between Israel and the Palestinians "impossible". Lauder said: "Such boycott calls are cynical and hypocritical. Minister Gilmore is taking aim at the only liberal democracy in the Middle East while keeping quiet about those who really wreak havoc in the region: the Assads, Ahmadinejads and their allies Hezbollah and Hamas." He added that "the West Bank territories are legally disputed and not illegally occupied."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/11814/world_jewish_congress_dismayed_at_irish_call_for_eu_ban_on_israeli_goods_from_west_bank|title=World Jewish Congress dismayed at Irish call for EU ban on Israeli goods from West Bank|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, on the third anniversary of Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu#June 2009 peace address; "Bar-Ilan Speech"|Benjamin Netanyahu's speech at Bar-Ilan University]], Lauder published a full-page ad in the [[Wall Street Journal]] and other newspapers in which he called on Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] to return to the negotiating table. "Accept the offer to talk, President Abbas. It takes two sides to make peace," Lauder wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4242587,00.html|title=World Jewish Congress urges Abbas to resume talks|date=17 June 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holocaust legacy issues===
The World Jewish Congress continues to focus on Holocaust legacy issues, including the restitution of Jewish assets seized during and after World War II.

====Holocaust remembrance====
Preserving the memory of the [[Shoah]] is a key issue in the WJC's public efforts. In January 2011, WJC President Lauder accompanied German President [[Christian Wulff]] and a number of Holocaust survivors to [[Auschwitz]]. Lauder declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Auschwitz is the largest Jewish cemetery in the world. Auschwitz is where the systematic annihilation of European Jewry was refined and perfected. It is where four gas chambers and four crematoria annihilated more than a million Jews. It is the place where the notorious SS ''Doctor'' Josef Mengele conducted cruel medical experiments on people. It is also the place where thousands upon thousands of Poles, Roma and Sinti and Soviet prisoners of war were brutally murdered alongside the Jewish victims. We owe it to all of them, and to the survivors, to make sure that today's anti-Semites and hatemongers – those who want to destroy the Jewish people and its only refugee, the Jewish nation state Israel – will not get another go at it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whjo.info/international-news/82-intl-holocaust-remembrance-day-ronald-lauder-in-auschwitz-for-ceremonies|title=Ronald Lauder in Auschwitz for Ceremonies, 27 January 2011|date=|accessdate=2012-07-02}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On January 28, 2017, WJC President Lauder defended a statement made by President [[Donald Trump]] on the occasion of [[International Holocaust Remembrance Day]] that had generated controversy for failing to mention that the victims of the Holocaust were Jewish. In response to [[Anti-Defamation League]] director [[Jonathan Greenblatt]]'s criticism of the statement, Lauder dismissed concern for remembering the Jewish identities of the victims of the Holocaust as "manufactured controversies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/lauder-criticizes-adls-negative-reaction-to-trump-statement-on-holocaust-remembrance-day-1-6-2017|title=Lauder criticizes ADL reaction to Trump statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day, 28 January 2017|date=|accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Restitution of Jewish assets====
Since the end of World War II, the WJC has pressed governments and private enterprises to return seized or looted Jewish assets to their rightful owners. It was instrumental in concluding agreements with a number of European countries.

''See above:'' [[World Jewish Congress#Restitution of Holocaust-era assets and compensation payments|Restitution of Holocaust-era assets and compensation payments]]

In its policy guidelines the WJC states that negotiations on Holocaust-era assets are "conducted in the framework of the World Jewish Restitution Organization in coordination with the Israeli government and with the support of the US government and the European Union."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/holocaust.html|title=WJC and the Holocaust|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The organization emphasizes that "the distribution of any compensation monies should not be handled by the WJC. The WJC does not seek any form of commission or gratification payments from Holocaust-era compensation or restitution agreements." WJC leaders have in particular urged the Polish government to come up with a restitution law for looted private properties, but Warsaw in March 2011 announced that this was impossible due to the current economic situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4042812,00.html
| title = Poland slammed for halting restitution plans - YNet|date=2011-03-16|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fighting Holocaust denial, revisionism and glorification of the Nazis====
On repeated occasions, the WJC has urged countries to ensure that Holocaust denial is publicly condemned and fought. WJC officials have been critical of a rise of marches in a number of European countries including Hungary and Serbia by WWII Nazi veterans, far-right extremists and neo-Nazis who publicly glorify the Hitler regime and espouse anti-Semitic ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/20367|title=Serbian police ban neo-Nazi group planned rally - European Jewish Press|date=2007-09-27|accessdate=2012-07-02|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130112200558/http://www.ejpress.org/article/20367|archive-date=2013-01-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budapesttimes.hu/2007/12/03/world-jewish-congress-asks-pm-to-rein-in-the-far-right/|title=World Jewish Congress asks PM to rein in the far right - Budapest Times|date=2007-12-03|accessdate=2012-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602154248/http://www.budapesttimes.hu/2007/12/03/world-jewish-congress-asks-pm-to-rein-in-the-far-right/|archive-date=2013-06-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bernie Ecclestone 2012 Bahrain.jpg|thumb|[[Bernie Ecclestone]]]]
In July 2009, [[Bernie Ecclestone]] faced calls from WJC President [[Ronald S. Lauder]] to resign as [[Formula One]] chief after he had praised [[Adolf Hitler]] in a newspaper interview and said that Hitler "got things done." Lauder said someone with Ecclestone's views should not be allowed to run such an important and popular racing series. He urged Formula One teams, drivers and host countries to suspend their cooperation with him. In reaction, Ecclestone told the news agency Associated Press that "I think the people who are saying that haven't got the power to say these things." Asked if the WJC was influential, Ecclestone said: "It's a pity they didn't sort the banks out" and "They have a lot of influence everywhere." After a public outcry, Ecclestone apologized for his remarks and said he had "been an idiot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nascar/story/11923197|title=F1 boss Ecclestone faces criticism over Hitler comments - CBSSports.com|date=2009-07-04|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/sports/jews-call-on-bernie-ecclestone-to-resign-over-hitler-remarks_100214406.html|title=Jews call on Bernie Ecclestone to resign over Hitler remarks - ThaiIndian.com|date=2009-07-06|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/racing/f1/news/story?id=4308574 |title=Ecclestone: Outrage 'probably my fault' - Associated Press|date=2009-07-06|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC also criticized the US internet retailer Amazon.com for selling 'I love Hitler' T-shirts and similar merchandise praising senior Nazi officials. The items were later removed from the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetretailer.com/2008/04/25/amazon-removes-i-love-hitler-t-shirts-following-protests |title=Amazon removes `I love Hitler` T-shirts following protests - Internet Retailer|date=2008-04-25|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, the WJC attacked the German Federal Constitutional Court for a ruling which acquitted a Holocaust denier. WJC Vice-President [[Charlotte Knobloch]] called the verdict "quirky" and said that it cast a damning light on the legal proceedings. She accused the highest German court of disposing of Germany's law that makes the denial of the Shoah a crime "through the backdoor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jspace.com/news/articles/german-courts-find-holocaust-deniers-innocent-in-two-cases/7675|title=German Courts Find Holocaust Deniers Innocent in Two Cases - JSpace, 23 February 2012|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206042227/http://www.jspace.com/news/articles/german-courts-find-holocaust-deniers-innocent-in-two-cases/7675|archive-date=2013-12-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an interview with Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] on German public television in which he repeatedly called Israel "an artificial state" that had been built on the "lie of the Holocaust", Knobloch called on the German government to publicly condemn the Iranian leader's statements and to isolate Iran diplomatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/11506/following_ahmadinejad_s_latest_holocaust_denial_wjc_urges_germany_to_scale_back_iran_relations|title=Following Ahmadinejad's latest Holocaust denial, WJC urges Germany to scale back Iran relations|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prosecution of Nazi war criminals====
The World Jewish Congress has repeatedly called for the prosecution of presumed Nazi war criminals. WJC President Ronald S. Lauder said in 2011: "There must never be impunity or closure for those who were involved in mass murder and genocide, irrespective of their age". The WJC would persist in its efforts to bring the "few old men out there who have the blood of innocent Shoah victims on their hands" before courts of law, to be tried and held accountable for their actions.&lt;ref name="worldjewishcongress.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/10240/ronald_lauder_hails_demjanjuk_conviction_by_german_court|title=Ronald Lauder hails Demjanjuk conviction by German court - WJC website|date=2011-05-12|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, WJC officials called for the extradition Ukrainian-born [[John Demjanjuk]] from the United States to Germany, where he was wanted on charges of aiding to kill at least 27,900 Jews at the Sobibor death camp during World War II. Demjanjuk's trial and conviction by a Munich court in May 2011 was hailed by the organization. It declared: "Belatedly, justice has now been done, and the family members of those who were brutally murdered in Sobibor will certainly welcome this verdict."&lt;ref name="worldjewishcongress.org"/&gt;

In December 2010, Lauder publicly urged Serbia to extradite [[Peter Egner]] to the United States where he was wanted to stand trial for serving in a Nazi unit during World War II that murdered 17,000 Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.680news.com/news/world/article/159963--world-jewish-congress-urges-us-to-extradite-alleged-world-war-ii-nazi-to-serbia-for-trial|title=World Jewish Congress urges US to extradite alleged World War II Nazi to Serbia for trial - Associated Press|date=2010-12-21|accessdate=2012-07-02}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Egner died in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/world/2011/01/31/17101636.html|title=(no title)|website=Toronto Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fighting anti-Semitism===
[[File:WJC meeting with Argentine President Cristina Kirchner.jpg|thumb|[[Eduardo Elsztain]] and [[Ronald S. Lauder]] with Argentine President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] in Buenos Aires, June 2008]]One of the principal activities of the World Jewish Congress has been to fight [[anti-Semitism]] in all its forms. Its stated policy on this issue is: "Governments and international organizations need to provide adequate resources for the fight against hatred, notably by providing security to Jewish communities and by improving education. Laws against anti-Semitism and other forms of racism need to be adopted and enforced properly in every country. All forms and expressions of [[neo-Nazism]], xenophobia and intolerance are unacceptable and have to be condemned, and the full force of the law needs to be applied to those who are a danger to democracy liberty and Jewish communities. Marches by extremist, anti-Semitic groups should be banned where national laws provide for such a possibility. Governments and political leaders should condemn such events and work together with local Jewish communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/1|title=WJC &amp; Combating Anti-Semitism|accessdate=2012-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602120831/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/1|archive-date=2012-06-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an opinion article entitled "Sweden's Shame", WJC President [[Ronald S. Lauder]] attacked the Swedish government, church officials and media for "fanning the flames" of hatred against Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sweden-s-shame|title=Sweden's Shame by Ronald S. Lauder - Project Syndicate|first=Ronald S.|last=Lauder|date=12 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, Lauder condemned as "despicable" remarks made by the Norwegian sociologist [[Johan Galtung]] who had "revived anti-Semitic canards such as Jewish control of the media" and suggested that Israel's Mossad could have been behind the 2011 "massacres in Norway committed by Anders Breivik" in which 77 people died. Lauder declared: "There is a growing tendency to blame the Jews for all evil that happens under the sun. It is a scandal that a leading academics such as Galtung does not shy away from citing notorious forgeries such as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion to support his bigoted arguments."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eju.org/news/world/ronald-lauder-condemns-norwegian-scholar-anti-semitic-statements |title=Ronald Lauder condemns Norwegian scholar anti-Semitic statements - EJU News, 3 May 2012 |access-date=2012-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518075946/http://www.eju.org/news/world/ronald-lauder-condemns-norwegian-scholar-anti-semitic-statements |archive-date=2012-05-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, the WJC president criticized Austrian politicians for failing to publicly denounce the leader of the third-largest political party in the country, the FPÖ, Heinz-Christian Strache, who had posted an anti-Semitic cartoon on his [[Facebook]] page. "Clearly, and not for the first time, the FPÖ leader is trying to whip up anti-Semitic sentiment. His repeated denials are not credible because his words and actions speak for themselves," Ronald Lauder said in a statement, adding: "This scandal shows that anti-Jewish resentment is still widespread, and unscrupulous politicians are allowed to exploit it for electioneering purposes. That is mind-boggling, and it could have negative repercussions for Austrian Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/bre87m0nl-us-austria-rightists-antisemitism/|title=Austrian rightist chief accused of anti-Semitism over cartoon - Reuters, 23 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] was chosen as a location for the 14th Plenary Assembly because of concerns over the rise of anti-Semitism in that country. Péter Feldmájer, president of the Federation of Jewish Communities in Hungary, stated this was "a symbol of solidarity with our Jewish community, which has been faced with growing anti-Semitism in recent years".&lt;ref name=Budapest1 /&gt; In his speech at the opening dinner, in the presence of Hungarian Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]], WJC President Ronald S. Lauder lambasted a series of recent anti-Semitic and racist incidents in Hungary. He particularly mentioned Zsolt Bayer, who had penned a newspaper column referring to Roma as "cowardly, repulsive, noxious animals" that are "unfit to live among people" and "shouldn't be allowed to exist." Lauder said "such words are reminiscent of the darkest era in European history" and concluded that "Hungary's international reputation has suffered in recent years" not because it was being "smeared by the foreign press" but rather due to extremists in the Jobbik party. "Jobbik is dragging the good name of Hungary through the mud," Lauder said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/prime-minister-viktor-orban-downplays-rising-anti-semitism-in-hungary-a-898319.html|title=Missing the Point: Hungarian Leader Whitewashes Anti-Semitism|first=James|last=Kirchick|date=6 May 2013|publisher=|via=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of the WJC assembly in Budapest, about 700 Jobbik supporters held a demonstration in downtown Budapest where they railed against "Zionists" who had "subjugated" the "indigenous people" of Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22413301|title=Anti-Jewish rally in Hungary capital|date=4 May 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his speech to WJC delegates, Orbán condemned the rise in anti-Semitism in Hungary and in Europe more widely. He called it a danger that "threatens even us Christians" and voiced determination to stamp it out. The WJC said in reaction that Orbán had not confronted the true nature of the problem. "We regret that Mr. Orbán did not address any recent anti-Semitic or racist incidents in the country, nor did he provide sufficient reassurance that a clear line has been drawn between his government and the far-right fringe," a WJC spokesman said afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/176038/hungary-premier-viktor-orban-fails-to-take-on-far/?p=all|title=Hungary Premier Viktor Orban Fails To Take on Far Right in Speech|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hatred on the internet====
The World Jewish Congress has also urged internet companies, including social media giants such as Google, to act against Holocaust denial, hate speech and anti-Jewish incitement on their platforms. A survey published by the WJC in 2017 revealed that "More than 382,000 anti-Semitic posts were uploaded to social media in 2016, an average of one post every 83 seconds",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/fast-forward/367015/study-anti-semitic-content-posted-on-social-media-every-83-seconds/|title=Anti-Semitic Content Posted On Social Media Every 83 Seconds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which WJC CEO [[R. Robert Singer]] said revealed "how alarming the situation really is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/an-anti-semitic-post-is-uploaded-to-social-media-every-83-seconds-wjc-research-finds-3-5-2017|title=An anti-Semitic post is uploaded to social media every 83 seconds, WJC research finds|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the organization had urged the German branch of [[YouTube]] of tolerating clips of neo-Nazi rock bands on its platform that were illegal in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/world-jewish-congress-slams-youtube-over-neo-nazi-153503664.html|title=World Jewish Congress slams YouTube over neo-Nazi videos|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an opinion piece for the [[Los Angeles Times]], Singer also accused the internet retailer [[Amazon.com]] of offering books that glorify the Holocaust. The WJC CEO wrote that Amazon customers "can buy a plethora of Holocaust-denying literature, swastika pendants and other Nazi memorabilia. While books are clearly different from doormats or flags, they still violate Amazon's guidelines, not to mention common decency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-singer-amazon-antisemitism-holocaust-denial-20170302-story.html|title=Why is Amazon selling Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism?|date=2 March 2017|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialogue with other religions===
The WJC believes that the three Abrahamic faiths (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) can cooperate "to respond to the challenges posed by developments in modern society, especially to discuss and promote shared values."&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/4|title=WJC &amp; Promoting Inter-Faith Dialogue|accessdate=2012-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607094601/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/4|archive-date=2012-06-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jewish-Christian dialogue====
Inter-religious dialogue between Jews and Christians started in the 1940s, notably with the establishment of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]] in Switzerland in 1947. The WJC has managed to establish good relations with the Catholic Church, especially since the [[Second Vatican Council]] and the Declaration ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' in 1965. Progress, however, is slow with regard to the Orthodox and Protestant Churches, which according to the WJC is mainly due to the decentralized nature of these churches and certain political issues related to the Middle East conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/4|title=WJC &amp; Promoting Inter-Faith Dialogue - WJC website|publisher=|access-date=2012-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607094601/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/4|archive-date=2012-06-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his election as new Catholic pontiff, [[Ronald Lauder]] called Cardinal [[Jorge Mario Bergoglio]] "an experienced man, someone who is known for his open-mindedness ... a man of dialogue, a man who is able to build bridges with other faiths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=7959|title=World Jewish Congress head praises Pope Francis – Israel Hayom|website=www.israelhayom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was instrumental in the creation inter-faith bodies such as the International Jewish Committee of Inter-religious Consultations (IJCIC), and it has actively participated in the [[International Catholic-Jewish Liaison Committee]] (ILC). The WJC also contributed to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the State of Israel and the Holy See in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1993/11/18/2879808/vatican-israel-near-accord-on-diplomatic-relations|title=Vatican, Israel Near Accord on Diplomatic Relations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, the WJC persuaded Pope John II to come out in favor of the removal of a convent of Carmelite nuns which had opened near the site of the former Nazi death camp Auschwitz.

The role of the Vatican during the Holocaust remains a controversial issue and has repeatedly flared up. The [[beatification]] and possible [[canonization]] of [[Pope Pius XII]] was criticized by WJC President [[Ronald S. Lauder]], who said that all Vatican archives on the period should be made accessible to scholars. "There are strong concerns about [[Pope Pius XII]]'s political role during World War II which should not be ignored," Lauder declared in a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clericalwhispers.blogspot.be/2009/12/wjc-chides-vatican-on-pius-xii.html|title=WJC chides Vatican on Pius XII|website=clericalwhispers.blogspot.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''See also:'' [[Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust]]

In February 2009, Lauder and the WJC were highly critical of the Vatican's decision to revoke the excommunication of [[Bishop Richard Williamson]], a senior member of the dissident Catholic group [[Society of St. Pius X]]. Williamson, in an interview with Swedish television, had denied the existence of gas chambers in Nazi concentration camps. Lauder said: "The Vatican was badly advised to revoke the excommunication of the four bishops ... Therefore, we call on Pope Benedict XVI to urgently address these concerns and to ensure that the achievements of four decades of Catholic-Jewish dialogue are not being damaged by a small minority of people who want to divide rather than unite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3667289,00.html|title=YNetNews: WJC head: Holocaust denial must be censured|accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lauder later praised Benedict XVI for writing a personal letter to Catholic bishops in which the Pope explained himself. "The Pope has found clear and unequivocal words regarding Bishop Williamson's Holocaust denial, and he deserves praise for admitting that mistakes were made within the Vatican in the handling of this affair," the WJC president was quoted as saying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=12347|title=World Jewish Congress President praises Pope - Catholic News, 13 March 2009|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717125915/http://cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=12347|archive-date=2012-07-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Ronald S. Lauder]] was also critical of the continued use of the [[Good Friday Prayer for the Jews]] in church liturgy. In an op-ed for the Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', the WJC president wrote: "When the Pope allows the use of the Good Friday Prayer of the old Tridentine liturgy, which calls for Jews to acknowledge Jesus Christ as the Savior of all men, some of us are deeply hurt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/8806/op_ed_ronald_lauder_calls_on_pope_benedict_xvi_to_clarify_vatican_s_stance_on_pius_xii|title=Op-Ed: Ronald Lauder calls on Pope Benedict XVI to clarify Vatican's stance on Pius XII|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dialogue with Islam====
[[File:Interreligious-Meeting - Mustafa Ceric - Herman Van-Rompuy-Marc-Schneier - Abdujalil Sajid - Brussels 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Bosnia's Grand Mufti [[Mustafa Ceric]], European Council President [[Herman Van Rompuy]], WJC Vice-President Rabbi [[Marc Schneier]], and British Imam Abdujalil Sajid in Brussels, December 2010]]

The World Jewish Congress considers dialogue with representatives of moderate [[Islam]] as "one of the most important and challenging issues at this time. The increasing gap of understanding between so-called Western liberal democracies and the Islamic world is extremely dangerous," according to the WJC website.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;

In 2008, WJC leaders met with King [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia]] at an inter-faith conference in the Spanish capital Madrid. Later that year, WJC President [[Ronald S. Lauder]] also called on the Saudi monarch in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/main/showNews/id/8419?print=true|title=WJC leaders meet with Saudi king in New York|accessdate=2012-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520210723/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/main/showNews/id/8419?print=true|archive-date=2013-05-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, WJC Vice-President [[Marc Schneier]] was received by King Hamad of Bahrain at the royal palace in Manama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/11100/wjc_vice_president_schneier_deeply_honored_to_be_first_rabbi_hosted_by_king_hamad_of_bahrain|title=WJC Vice President Schneier 'deeply honored' to be first rabbi hosted by King Hamad of Bahrain|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Jewish Congress also co-hosted a gathering of European Muslim and Jewish leaders in Brussels in December 2010, which included meetings with senior European Union officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3996576,00.html|title=UK Imam prays for Carmel Fire victims|date=9 December 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that occasion, WJC Vice-President Marc Schneier declared: "We have hopefully kick-started a movement that will spread across Europe. The recipe really is quite simple: our two communities must focus more on what unites us than what separates us. We also must restrain the radicals within our own ranks and make sure they don't gain the upper hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/47697|title=Brussels gathering calls for closer cooperation between Muslims and Jews in Europe - European Jewish Press, 6 December 2010|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-05|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130112173423/www.ejpress.org/article/47697|archive-date=2013-01-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech in London in 2010, Schneier praised leaders of the [[Al-Azhar University]] in Cairo, considered the oldest center of Islamic scholarship in the world, for opening up inter-religious dialogue to the Jews. He declared: "This is a landmark decision, and Al-Azhar deserves praise for it.

===Pluralistic Israel===
In August 2018, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder called on "Israel's government to listen to the voices of protest and outrage" and uphold the country's democratic and egalitarian principles against the threat of dominance by restrictive Orthodox influence, from what he called 'a radical minority'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/opinion/israel-ronald-lauder-nation-state-law.html Israel, This Is Not Who We Are], [[New York Times]], opinion by WJC President Ronald S.

===Opposing Iran===
Since the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution in 1979]], and in particular following the terrorist attacks [[1992 attack on Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires|against the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in February 1992]] and the [[1994 AMIA bombing|AMIA Jewish center in Buenos Aires in July 1994]], in which over 100 people were killed and which Iran's leadership was accused of having masterminded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1995/01/04/2882946/six-months-after-bombing-argentina-recalls-ambassador|title=Six Months After Bombing, Argentina Recalls Ambassador|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the World Jewish Congress has been vocal in denouncing what it calls the "Iranian threat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/5|title=WJC &amp; the Iranian Threat - WJC website|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624065358/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/5|archive-date=2012-06-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, then WJC President [[Edgar Bronfman, Sr.]] was reportedly instrumental in blocking a planned deal by the [[DuPont]]-owned US oil firm [[Conoco]] with Iran. Bronfman was a member of the DuPont board of directors. The deal would have been the first major investment by an oil company in Iran since 1979, when the United States broke off trade with the country after the seizure of the US Embassy in Teheran by Islamic militants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-15/business/fi-43080_1_clinton-administration-officials Clinton Kills Pending Iran-Conoco Oil Deal : Policy: Order will bar development in Mideast nation and reassert hard-line stance taken since '79 hostage crisis - ''Los Angeles Times'', 15 March 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, the WJC publicly welcomed a decision by US President [[Bill Clinton]] to impose a trade embargo on Iran. "We applaud President Clinton's decisive blow against terrorism," declared WJC Executive Director Elan Steinberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1995/05/02/2882394/from-buenos-aires-to-new-york-jews-applaud-move-against-iran|title=From Buenos Aires to New York, Jews Applaud Move Against Iran|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, after prosecutors in Argentina asked a judge to order the arrest of a former Iranian President [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] and other members of his government in connection with the [[1994 AMIA bombing|AMIA bombing]], Bronfman said that "Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism", adding that "the entire international community has a moral responsibility to ensure that Iran is held accountable for its terrorist actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/8300/edgar_m_bronfman_iran_is_a_sponsor_of_terrorism_|title=Edgar M.

The WJC lobbied for the issuing of [[Interpol notice|Red Notices]] by [[Interpol]] against the Iranian suspects in the bombing case, which were approved by the Interpol General Assembly in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/world-jewish-congress-says-interpol-has-proven-the-646645.html?cat=17|title=Yahoo|website=Yahoo|access-date=2012-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207202921/http://voices.yahoo.com/world-jewish-congress-says-interpol-has-proven-the-646645.html?cat=17|archive-date=2013-12-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 18th anniversary of the AMIA bombing in July 2012, WJC President Lauder declared: "The Iranian regime has blood on its hands, not only by suppressing dissent at home but also by sponsoring terrorism world-wide. What the world saw 18 years ago in Buenos Aires it can still see today, be it in Syria, in Lebanon or in other places."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/70170/iran-has-blood-its-hands-over-1994-argentina-blast Iran has 'blood on its hands' over 1994 Argentina blast – ''Jewish Chronicle'', 17 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 resolution on Iran, the WJC expressed support for international condemnation of current Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s repeated calls for the abolition of the State of Israel and his statements questioning the Holocaust. The organization resolved "to make the four-fold threat (the nuclear threat; the threat of genocidal incitement; international state sponsored terrorism; and the systematic and widespread violations of the human and civil rights of the Iranian people) that the current Iranian regime poses to international peace and stability, a high strategic priority of the WJC."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/fd1f7613f1eb2952cd96fba32ecc307cd45d672b.pdf+|title=World Jewish Congress|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|website=www.worldjewishcongress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the WJC launched the ''Iran Update'', "a comprehensive weekly publication disseminated via the internet to most members of the US Congress and government, United Nations missions, foreign diplomats, European Union officials, and Israeli policymakers, in addition to Jewish communities worldwide." The publication focused on exposing Iran's ongoing pursuit of a nuclear capability, domestic Iranian politics, Iranian foreign policy in the Middle East and internationally, Israeli policy vis-à-vis Iran and the efforts of worldwide Jewish communities in combating Iranian Holocaust-denial and nuclear proliferation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/d1eede45968612158044b79bf6a95e1c5fc2a85b.pdf+|title=World Jewish Congress|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|website=www.worldjewishcongress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further to the WJC's and other international organizations' calls, representatives of many Western countries either did not show up or walked out of the conference chamber when Iranian President Ahmadinejad attacked Israel in his speech to the Durban Review Conference in Geneva in April 2009 and to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] meeting in New York in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/wjc-world-must-boycott-ahmadinejad-speech-at-un-1.7905|title=WJC: World Must Boycott Ahmadinejad Speech at UN|first=Shlomo|last=Shamir|date=14 September 2009|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/iran|title=UN Chamber Mostly Empty for Ahmadinejad Speech - WJC website, September 2009|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724082049/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/iran|archive-date=2012-07-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The WJC has repeatedly run campaigns accusing Iran of deceiving the international community and calling Ahmadinejad "the world's foremost hatemonger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/9013/stoppt_irans_diktator_+|title=Stoppt Irans Diktator!|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, WJC President [[Ronald S. Lauder]] criticized a visit by Swiss Foreign Minister [[Micheline Calmy-Rey]] to Tehran, where she met with Ahmadinejad mainly to help a Swiss company secure a multibillion-dollar contract to buy natural gas from Iran. Lauder told a press conference in Bern: "Maybe that money that Switzerland is paying to Iran will some day be used to either buy weapons to kill Israelis, or buy weapons to kill Americans, or buy missiles to be able to deliver nuclear weapons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-04-29-3972860867_x.htm+|title=Latest World &amp; National News &amp; Headlines - USATODAY.com|website=www.usatoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauder also led diplomatic efforts to persuade European businesses to withdraw from Iran. In January 2010, he warmly welcomed the announcement by [[Siemens]] CEO [[Peter Löscher]] that his company would not seek new business in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2010/01/27/siemens_to_stop_doing_business_in_iran/|title=Siemens to stop doing business in Iran|first=George|last=Frey|date=27 January 2010|publisher=|via=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC has repeatedly urged the international community to do more to bring to justice the masterminds of the terrorist attacks against Israel's embassy and AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in the 1990s, which Argentinean prosecutors have said were carried out at the instigation of senior Iranian officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/56827|title=20 years after Buenos Aires bombing attack, World Jewish Congress urges to do more to root out Iran-sponsored international terror - European Jewish Press, 16 March 2012|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-09|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130112153852/www.ejpress.org/article/56827|archive-date=2013-01-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Olympic news outlet ''Around the Rings''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aroundtherings.com/articles/view.aspx?id=37563 |title=Calls to Ban Iran from Olympics; Olympic Obituaries |publisher=Aroundtherings.com |date=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that World Jewish Congress president [[Ronald S. Lauder]] had issued a statement urging IOC officials to ban Iran from participating in the Olympic Games, citing Iranian athletes' refusal to compete against Israeli athletes. "It is high time that a strong signal is sent to Iran that unless this long-standing boycott is lifted, Iranian athletes will not be allowed to enter major international events such as next year's Olympic Games in London", Lauder said. The WJC reiterated its position when in May 2012 Iranian President Ahmadinejad announced plans to attend the London Olympics.  Ahmadinejad has "no business" attending the London Olympic Games this summer, the ''Jewish Chronicle'' quoted a World Jewish Congress spokesman as saying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/67809/irans-ahmadinejad-wants-come-london-olympics|title=Iran's Ahmadinejad wants to come to the London Olympics|publisher=Jewish Chronicle|date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish refugees from Arab countries===
The issue of [[Jewish refugees from Arab lands]] continues to be on the World Jewish Congress agenda today. The WJC website states that "The plight of Jews who fled from, or still live in, Arab lands and their specific concerns are not well-known and need to be raised with governments and international organizations. Where illegal seizure of assets took place, these should be returned to their former owners, or adequate compensation should be paid. Jews remaining in Arab lands, as well as other religious minorities, should be granted religious freedom and allowed to practice their faith according to their traditions. Jewish communal sites in Arab countries must be preserved and respected." The WJC believes that the plight of the Jewish refugees from Arab lands has been neglected for decades by the international community, including governments and international organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/2|title=WJC &amp; Jews From Arab Lands|publisher=|access-date=2012-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602122939/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/2|archive-date=2012-06-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, the WJC co-hosted two conferences on the issue, together with the Israeli government. They were held in Jerusalem and at the [[United Nations]] headquarters in New York, respectively. The aim was to raise the profile of the issue and enlist international support. In a speech to the New York symposium, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder urged the world to recognize the suffering of Jewish refugees. "Now is the time to set the historical, diplomatic and legal record straight. Lasting peace can only be built on historical facts - both the issues of the Jewish refugees and the Palestinian refugees must be addressed." Lauder said that "only addressing the historical facts" could help to bring about peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/12336/peace_only_possible_if_plight_of_jewish_refugees_from_arab_countries_is_addressed_lauder_tells_un|title=Peace only possible if plight of Jewish refugees from Arab countries is addressed, Lauder tells UN|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Jerusalem conference, a joint declaration was adopted calling on the United Nations to place the issue of Jewish refugees on its agenda and that of its affiliated forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/d0a520a41e671e66473c81cbbc5bc792c553fb93.pdf|title=Jerusalem Declaration on Justice for Jews from Arab Countries|publisher=|access-date=2012-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024065533/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/d0a520a41e671e66473c81cbbc5bc792c553fb93.pdf|archive-date=2012-10-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian critics derided the move to raise this issue now as a "manipulative strategy". It was "part of a public relations campaign that is both cynical and hypocritical", PLO Executive member [[Hanan Ashrawi]] told the newspaper [[USA Today]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/10/11/jewish-refugees-from-war-of-independence-seek-justice/1621037/|title=Jewish refugees want 'justice' like Palestinians, some say it's a ploy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the conferences, Israel's Foreign Minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]] instructed Israeli diplomats around the world to raise the matter in all official government meetings and with parliamentarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=289051|title=Diaspora - Jewish people world news - The Jerusalem Post|website=www.jpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to figures provided by the Israeli Foreign Ministry, approximately 850,000 Jews from Arab states across the Middle East left their native countries following the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 due to state-sponsored persecution. Most of them were forced to abandon their property and possessions, the ministry said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=284548|title=PM: Israel must bring justice to Jewish Refugees - Jerusalem Post, 10 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other issues===
In August 2008, World Jewish Congress and Venezuelan Jewish community leaders met in Caracas with Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez Frias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/3716|title=Venezuela Analysis: Venezuela's Chavez Meets with President of World Jewish Congress|accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting stirred some controversy in the Jewish world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/comment/4668/shame-those-our-leaders-who-back-chavez|title=Jewish Chronicle - Isi Leibler: Shame on those of our leaders who back Chavez|accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of Chávez' public support for Iranian leader [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] and his strong criticism of Israel. However, then WJC Secretary-General Michael Schneider defended the meeting with Chávez and said the WJC acted only on behalf of, and with the backing of, the Venezuelan Jewish community.

Following the exclusion of Israeli tennis player [[Shahar Peer]] from an [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] tournament in Dubai in February 2009, the WJC called for the "suspension of all sporting events in the [United Arab Emirates] until Israeli participants are admitted." The response of the women's and men's tours to the exclusion of Peer had been "faint-hearted," and they should have canceled the event immediately, WJC President Lauder was quoted by the news agency [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] as saying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/9061/israel_player_ram_to_get_dubai_visa_congressman_says|title=Israel Player Ram to Get Dubai Visa, Congressman Says|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, the World Jewish Congress criticized the president of the [[International Olympic Committee]], [[Jacques Rogge]], for not agreeing to hold one minute's silence at the opening ceremony in remembrance of the [[Munich Massacre|eleven Israeli sportsmen killed by Palestinian terrorists during the Olympic Games in Munich in 1972]]. Ronald Lauder said Rogge's stance was "unfeeling" and "completely out of touch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/22/sport/olympics-munich-silence/index.html|title=Olympics head rejects silence for Israeli victims - CNN|first=By Richard Allen Greene,|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added: "Forty years after the saddest moment in Olympic history - when eleven Israeli athletes and sports officials and a German police officer were killed by Palestinian terrorists - it would have been an excellent opportunity to show to everyone that the sports world stands united against terrorism ... Nobody wants to 'politicize' the Olympic Games, as the IOC seems to suggest, but Baron Rogge and his colleagues on the IOC Executive have utterly failed - or refused - to grasp the importance of such a symbolic act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/jewish-group-slams-olympics-for-refusing-munich-massacre-minute-of-silence-1.452910|title=Haaretz.Com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundraising and finances==
The WJC raises its funds mainly through the World Jewish Congress American Section, which is a non-profit body registered in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/donate_support|title=Donate Today - WJC website|publisher=|access-date=2013-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829021554/https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/donate_support|archive-date=2013-08-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies, internal conflicts and allegations of financial irregularities (2004-2007)===
A series of allegations about the organization's accounting practices and "unusual" money transfers, was raised in 2004 by [[Isi Leibler]], then a vice-president of the WJC. It led to an investigation of the finances of the World Jewish Congress.&lt;ref name=buncombe/&gt; A comprehensive audit of the WJC's accounts in Switzerland from 1995–2004, conducted by the accounting firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], reportedly found that "over the years $3.8 million 'disappeared' from the bank accounts"&lt;ref name=barkat&gt;{{cite web|last=Barkat |first=Amiram |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/828961.html |title=Where was Edgar Bronfman? | work=Haaretz  |date=2011-05-17 |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that there were "significant un-reconciled cash withdrawals where there is no documentation of the usage of the funds."&lt;ref name=popperwjcaudit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/wjc-audit-4-million-unaccounted-for/ |title=WJC Audit: $3 Million Unaccounted For – |publisher=Forward.com |date=2006-11-03 |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, an investigation by the Office of the NY State Attorney General into the matter found no evidence of criminal conduct on the part of the WJC.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Strom, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/16/us/16jewish.html World Jewish Congress Dismisses Leader]", [[The New York Times]], March 16, 2007. Retrieved June 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the report of Attorney General [[Eliot Spitzer]] noted that the WJC had implemented all of his recommendations to improve financial oversight and management.

Spitzer's office identified financial mismanagement and breaches of fiduciary duty, but found no criminal wrongdoing and concluded that any misconduct "did not compromise the core mission" of the organization or result in "identifiable losses of charitable assets."&lt;ref name=edenpopper&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/ny-probe-of-charity-cites-mismanagement/ |title=N.Y. Probe of Charity Cites Mismanagement – |publisher=Forward.com |date=2006-02-03 |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report also highlighted several initiatives the WJC had taken since 2004 to improve financial management, including "the creation of an audit committee and the position of chief financial officer, the computerization of all financial records, the creation of an employee handbook outlining official procedures and policies, the implementation of travel and reimbursement procedures, and the creation of a new fund-raising entity (the WJC Foundation)."&lt;ref&gt;Ami Eden and Nathanial Popper, "[http://forward.com/articles/1583/ny-probe-of-charity-cites-mismanagement NY Probe of Charity Cites Mismanagement]," [[The Jewish Daily Forward]], February 3, 2006. Retrieved June 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite vigorously defending [[Israel Singer]] during the Attorney General's inquiry, in March 2007 Bronfman abruptly announced his firing. He accused Singer of "'help[ing] himself to cash from the WJC office, my cash."&lt;ref name=barkat2&gt;{{cite web|last=Barkat |first=Amiram |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/841279.html |title=Members of the Tribe / The end of a beautiful friendship - Haaretz Daily Newspaper &amp;#124; Israel News |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2011-05-17 |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, internal WJC documents seemed to suggest that a friction had developed between Singer and Bronfman over Singer's position on various internal WJC political matters, including the perception that he was insufficiently advocating the candidacy of Edgar Bronfman's son [[Matthew Bronfman|Matthew]] to the presidency of the WJC.&lt;ref name=popperduo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/ugly-allegations-fly-as-fabled-wjc-duo-splits/ |title=Ugly Allegations Fly as Fabled WJC Duo Splits – |publisher=Forward.com |date=2007-03-23 |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
