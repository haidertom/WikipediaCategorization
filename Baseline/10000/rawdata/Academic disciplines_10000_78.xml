'''Alvin Plantinga's free will defense''' is a [[Problem of evil#Logical problem of evil|logical argument]] developed by American [[Analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] [[Alvin Plantinga]], the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the [[University of Notre Dame]], and published in its final version in his 1977 book ''God, Freedom, and Evil''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=God, Freedom, and Evil|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|publisher=Eerdmans|year=1977|isbn=0-8028-1731-9|location=Grand Rapids, MI:|pages=Chapter 4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Free Will Defense", in [[Max Black]] (ed), ''Philosophy in America''. Ithaca: Cornell UP / London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's argument is a defense against the [[Problem of evil#Logical problem of evil|logical problem of evil]] as formulated by philosopher [[J. L. Mackie]] beginning in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Evil and Omnipotence|journal=Mind|volume=64|issue=210|pages=455–465|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mackie's formulation of the logical problem of evil argued that three attributes of God, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, in orthodox Christian theism are logically incompatible with the existence of evil. In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his argument in ''The Miracle of Theism,'' though he did not claim that the problem of evil had been put to rest.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Miracle of Theism.|last=Mackie|first=J. L.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=|location=Oxford:|pages=154|quote=Since this defense is formally [that is, logically] possible, and its principle involves no real abandonment of our ordinary view of the opposition between good and evil, we can concede that the problem of evil does not, after all, show that the central doctrines of theism are logically inconsistent with one another. But whether this offers a real solution of the problem is another question.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mackie's logical argument from evil ==

The logical argument from evil argued by J. L. Mackie, and to which the free will defense responds, is an argument against the existence of the Christian God based on the idea that a logical contradiction exists between four theological tenets in orthodox Christian theology. Specifically, the argument from evil asserts that the following set of propositions are, by themselves, logically inconsistent or contradictory:
# God is omniscient (all-knowing)
# God is omnipotent  (all-powerful)
# God is omnibenevolent (morally perfect)
# There is evil in the world
Most orthodox Christian theologians agree with the first three propositions describing God as all-knowing (1), all-powerful (2), and morally perfect (3), and agree with the proposition that there is evil in the world, as described in proposition (4). The logical argument from evil asserts that a God with the attributes (1-3), must know about all evil, would be capable of preventing it, and as morally perfect would be motivated to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mackie|first=J. L.|year=1955|title=Evil and Omnipotence|journal=Mind|volume=64|pages=200–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCloskey|first=H. J.|year=1960|title=God and Evil|journal=Philosophical Quarterly|volume=10|pages=97–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument from evil concludes that the existence of the orthodox Christian God is, therefore, incompatible with the existence of evil and can be logically ruled out.

== Plantinga's free will defense ==
Plantinga's [[free will]] defense begins by asserting that Mackie's argument failed to establish an ''explicit'' logical contradiction between God and the existence of evil. In other words Plantinga shows that (1-4) are not on their own contradictory, and that any contradiction must originate from an atheologian's ''implicit'' unstated assumptions, assumptions representing premises not stated in the argument itself. With an ''explicit'' contradiction ruled out, an atheologian must add premises to the argument for it to succeed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Nonetheless, if Plantinga had offered no further argument then an atheologian's intuitive impressions that a contradiction must exist would have remained unanswered. Plantinga sought to resolve this by offering two further points.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

First, Plantinga pointed out that God, though [[omnipotent]], could not be expected to do literally anything. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create beings with free will that would never choose evil.&lt;sup&gt;[[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense#cite note-3|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification that God could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Plantinga did not claim to have shown that the conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, nor did he assert that God's reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the logical problem of evil was unsound.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Plantinga's defense has received strong support among Christian academic philosophers and theologians.&lt;ref name="Howard-Snyder"&gt;"It used to be widely held by philosophers that God and evil are incompatible. Not any longer. Alvin Plantinga's Free Will Defense is largely responsible for this shift."{{cite journal|last=Howard-Snyder|first=Daniel|year=1999|title=Transworld Sanctity and Plantinga's Free Will Defense|url=http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Howard-Snyder-Transworld-Sanctity-and-Plantingas-Free-Will-Defense.pdf|journal=International Journal for the Philosophy of Religion|volume=16|issue=3|pages=336–351|author2=John O’Leary-Hawthorne|access-date=2013-09-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215091750/http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Howard-Snyder-Transworld-Sanctity-and-Plantingas-Free-Will-Defense.pdf|archive-date=2011-12-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meister"&gt;"Most philosophers have agreed that the free will defense has defeated the logical problem of evil.

In addition to Plantinga's free will defense, there are other arguments purporting to undermine or disprove the logical argument from evil.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Plantinga's free will defense is the best known of these responses at least in part because of his thoroughness in describing and addressing the relevant questions and issues in ''God, Freedom, and Evil.''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Further details ==
As opposed to a [[theodicy]] (a ''justification'' for God's actions), Plantinga puts forth a ''defense'', offering a new proposition that is intended to demonstrate that it is logically possible for an omnibenevolent, omnipotent and omniscient God to create a world that contains moral evil. Significantly, Plantinga does not need to assert that his new proposition is true, merely that it is logically valid. In this way Plantinga's approach differs from that of a traditional theodicy, which would strive to show not just that the new propositions are valid, but that the argument is sound, [[prima facie]] plausible, or that there are good grounds for making it.&lt;ref name="Surin1995p193"&gt;{{harvnb|Surin|1995|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the burden of proof on Plantinga is lessened, and yet his approach may still serve as a defense against the claim by Mackie that the simultaneous existence of evil and an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God is "positively irrational".&lt;ref name="Mackie200"&gt;{{harvnb|Mackie|1955|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Plantinga summarised his defense:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1974|pp=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A world containing creatures who are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't ''cause'' or ''determine'' them to do only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not do what is right ''freely''. To create creatures capable of ''moral good'', therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil and at the same time prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of [[moral evil]]. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plantinga's argument is that even though God is omnipotent, it is ''possible'' that it was not in his power to create a world containing moral good but no moral evil; therefore, there is no logical inconsistency involved when God, although wholly good, creates a world of free creatures who choose to do evil.&lt;ref name="Peterson 1991 130–133"&gt;{{harvnb|Peterson|Hasker|Reichenbach|Basinger|1991|pp=130–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument relies on the following propositions:
# There are possible worlds that even an omnipotent being can not actualize.
# A world with morally free creatures producing only moral good is such a world.
Plantinga refers to the first statement as "Leibniz's lapse" as the opposite was assumed by Leibniz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second proposition is more contentious. Plantinga rejects the compatibilist notion of freedom whereby God could directly cause agents to only do good without sacrificing their freedom. Although it would contradict a creature's freedom if God were to cause, or in Plantinga's terms ''strongly actualize'', a world where creatures only do good, an omniscient God would still know the circumstances under which creatures would go wrong. Thus, God could avoid creating such circumstances, thereby ''weakly actualizing'' a world with only moral good. Plantinga's crucial argument is that this possibility may not be available to God because all possible morally free creatures suffer from "transworld depravity".

== Reception ==
According to Chad Meister, professor of philosophy at [[Bethel College (Indiana)|Bethel College]], most philosophers accept Plantinga's free will defense and thus see the logical problem of evil as having been sufficiently rebutted.&lt;ref name="Meister134"/&gt; [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] says that "it is fair to say that Plantinga has solved this problem. That is, he has argued convincingly for the consistency of [[God and evil]]."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{harvnb|Howard-Snyder|O'Leary-Hawthorne|1998|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Alston]] has said that "Plantinga [...] has established the possibility that God could not actualize a world containing free creatures that always do the right thing."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{harvnb|Alston|1991|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William L. Rowe]] has written "granted [[incompatibilism]], there is a fairly compelling argument for the view that the existence of evil is logically consistent with the existence of the theistic God", referring to Plantinga's argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rowe|1979|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Arguing about Gods'', [[Graham Oppy]] offers a dissent, acknowledging that "[m]any philosophers seem to suppose that [Plantinga's free will defense] utterly demolishes the kinds of 'logical' arguments from evil developed by Mackie" but continuing "I am not sure this is a correct assessment of the current state of play".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oppy|2006|pp=262–263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurring with Oppy, A.M. Weisberger writes “contrary to popular theistic opinion, the logical form of the argument is still alive and beating.”&lt;ref name="Weisberger 1999 39"&gt;{{harvnb|Weisberger|1999|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among contemporary philosophers, most discussion on the [[problem of evil]] presently revolves around the ''evidential'' problem of evil, namely that the existence of God is unlikely, rather than illogical.&lt;ref name="BeebeIEP"&gt;{{harvnb|Beebe|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Additional objections and responses ==

=== Incompatibilist view of free will === 
[[File:FreeWillTaxonomy2.svg|right|thumb|250px|alt=A diagram. At the top, an orange box labeled "Determinism?" with two arrows pointing to other boxes. The arrow labeled "True" points to an orange box labeled "Free will?", the arrow labeled "False" points to a light-blue box labeled "Libertarianism". The box labeled "Free will?" has two arrows pointing to other boxes. The arrow labeled "True" points to a light-blue box labeled "Compatibilism", the arrow labeled "False" points to a light-blue box labeled "Hard determinism". The two light-blue boxes labeled "Hard determinism" and "Libertarianism" are surrounded by a grey ellipse labeled "Incompatibilism".|A simplified taxonomy of the main positions on the nature of free will.]]
Critics of Plantinga's argument, such as philosopher [[Antony Flew]], have responded that it presupposes a libertarian, [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] view of free will (free will and determinism are metaphysically incompatible), while their view is a [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|compatibilist]] view of free will (free will and determinism, whether physical or divine, are metaphysically compatible).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackie|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flew|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of compatibilists is that God could have created a world containing moral good but no moral evil. In such a world people could have chosen to only perform good deeds, even though all their choices were predestined.&lt;ref name="Peterson 1991 130–133"/&gt;

Plantinga dismisses compatibilism, stating "this objection... seems utterly implausible. One might as well claim that being in jail doesn't really limit one's freedom on the grounds that if one were not in jail, he'd be free to come and go as he pleased".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transworld depravity ===
Plantinga's idea of weakly actualizing a world can be viewed as having God actualizing a subset of the world, letting the free choices of creatures complete the world. Therefore, it is certainly possible that a person completes the world by only making morally good choices; that is, there exist possible worlds where a person freely chooses to do no moral evil. However, it may be the case that for each such world, there is some morally significant choice that this person would do differently if these circumstances were to occur in the actual world. In other words, each such possible world contains a ''world segment'', meaning everything about that world up to the point where the person must make that critical choice, such that if that segment was part of the actual world, the person would instead go wrong in completing that world. Formally, ''transworld depravity'' is defined as follows:&lt;ref name="Plantinga 1977 48"&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|
A person ''P suffers from transworld depravity'' if and only if the following holds: for every world ''W'' such that ''P'' is significantly free in ''W'' and ''P'' does only what is right in ''W'', there is an action ''A'' and a maximal world segment ''S´'' such that
# ''S´'' includes ''A'' 's being morally significant for ''P''
# ''S´'' includes ''P'' 's being free with respect to ''A''
# ''S´'' is included in ''W'' and includes neither ''P'' 's performing ''A'' nor ''P'' 's refraining from performing ''A''
# If ''S´'' were actual, ''P'' would go wrong with respect to ''A''.}}
Less formally: Consider all possible (not actual) worlds in which someone always chooses the right. In all those, there will be a subpart of the world that says that person was free to choose a certain right or wrong action, but does not say whether they chose it. If that subpart were actual (in the real world), then they would choose the wrong.

Plantinga responds that "What is important about the idea of transworld depravity is that if a person suffers from it, then it wasn't within God's power to actualize any world in which that person is significantly free but does no wrong—that is, a world in which he produces moral good but no moral evil"&lt;ref name="Plantinga 1977 48" /&gt; and that it is logically ''possible'' that every person suffers from transworld depravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2574">The '''Association for Computers and the Humanities''' ('''ACH''') is the primary international professional society for [[digital humanities]]. ACH was founded in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Hockey, Susan. "The History of Humanities Computing." In: A Companion to Digital Humanities, ed. Susan Schreibman, Ray Siemens, John Unsworth. Oxford: Blackwell, 2004. [http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [http://www.ach.org/ official website], the organization "support[s] and disseminate[s] research and cultivate[s] a vibrant professional community through conferences, publications, and outreach activities." ACH is based in the United States, and has an international membership. ACH is a founding member of the [[Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations]] (ADHO), a co-originator of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tei-c.org/About/history.xml&lt;/ref&gt; and a co-sponsor of an annual conference.

==Conference==

ACH has been a co-sponsor of the annual [[Digital Humanities conference]] (formerly ACH/ALLC, before that International Conference on Computing in the Humanities or ICCH) since 1989.

In education, '''authentic learning''' is an instructional approach that allows students to explore, discuss, and meaningfully construct concepts and relationships in contexts that involve real-world problems and projects that are relevant to the learner.&lt;ref name="Donovan"&gt;Donovan, S., Bransford, J., &amp; Pellegrino. (1999). ''How People Learn: Bridging Research and Practice.'' Washington, DC: National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to a "wide variety of educational and instructional techniques focused on connecting what students are taught in school to real-world issues, problems, and applications. The basic idea is that students are more likely to be interested in what they are learning, more motivated to learn new concepts and skills, and better prepared to succeed in college, careers, and adulthood if what they are learning mirrors real-life contexts, equips them with practical and useful skills, and addresses topics that are relevant and applicable to their lives outside of school."&lt;ref&gt;Authentic Learning. (n.d.) The Glossary of Education Reform. Retrieved from http://edglossary.org/authentic-learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

Authentic instruction will take on a much different form than traditional teaching methods. In the traditional classroom, students take a passive role in the learning process. Knowledge is considered to be a collection of facts and procedures that are transmitted from the teacher to the student. In this view, the goal of education is to possess a large collection of these facts and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Sawyer, K. (2006). ''The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences.'' New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Authentic learning, on the other hand, takes a [[constructivist teaching methods|constructivist]] approach, in which learning is an active process. Teachers provide opportunities for students to construct their own knowledge through engaging in self-directed inquiry, problem solving, critical thinking, and reflections in real-world contexts. This knowledge construction is heavily influenced by the student's prior knowledge and experiences, as well as by the characteristics that shape the learning environment, such as values, expectations, rewards, and sanctions. Education is more student-centered. Students no longer simply memorize facts in abstract and artificial situations, but they experience and apply information in ways that are grounded in reality.&lt;ref name="Newmann"&gt;Newmann, F., Marks, H., &amp; Gamoran, A. (1995). Authentic pedagogy: Standards that boost student performance. ''Issues in Restructuring Schools,'' 8, 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==

There is no definitive description of authentic learning. Educators must develop their own interpretations of what creates meaning for the students in their classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Maina, F. (2004). Authentic learning: Perspectives from contemporary educators. ''Journal of Authentic Learning.'' Retrieved from https://dspace.sunyconnect.suny.edu/bitstream/handle/1951/389/maina.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the literature suggests that there are several characteristics of authentic learning. It is important to note that authentic learning tasks do not have to have all the characteristics. They can be thought of as being on a spectrum, with tasks being more or less authentic. The characteristics of authentic learning include the following:
*Authentic learning is centered on authentic, relevant, real-world tasks that are of interest to the learners.
*Students are actively engaged in [[exploration]] and [[inquiry]]. 
*Learning, most often, is [[interdisciplinary]]. It requires integration of content from several disciplines and leads to outcomes beyond the domain-specific [[learning outcomes]].
*Learning is closely connected to the world beyond the walls of the classroom. 
*Students become engaged in complex tasks and [[higher-order thinking]] skills, such as analyzing, synthesizing, designing, manipulating, and evaluating information. 
*Learning begins with a question or problem, which cannot be constricting in that it allows the student to construct their own response and inquiry. The outcome of the learning experience cannot be predetermined.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blumenfeld|first1=Phyllis C.|last2=Soloway|first2=Elliot|last3=Marx|first3=Ronald W.|last4=Krajcik|first4=Joseph S.|last5=Guzdial|first5=Mark|last6=Palincsar|first6=Annemarie|title=Motivating Project-Based Learning: Sustaining the Doing, Supporting the Learning|journal=Educational Psychologist|date=1991|volume=26|issue=3&amp;4|pages=369–398|doi=10.1080/00461520.1991.9653139}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Students produce a product that can be shared with an audience outside the classroom. These products have value in their own right, rather than simply for earning a grade. 
* The resulting products are concrete allowing them to be shared and critiqued; this feedback allows the learner to be reflective and deepen their learning.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
*Learning is student driven, with tutors, peers, teachers, parents, and outside experts all assisting and coaching in the learning process. 
*Learners employ [[instructional scaffolding]] techniques at critical times.
*Students have opportunities for social [[discourse]], [[collaboration]], and [[Human self-reflection|reflection]]. 
*Ample resources are available. 
*[[Educational assessment|Assessment]] of authentic learning is integrated seamlessly within the learning task in order to reflect similar, real world assessments. This is known as [[authentic assessment]] and is in contrast to traditional learning assessments in which an exam is given after the knowledge or skills have hopefully been acquired. 
*Authentic learning provides students with the opportunity to examine the problem from different perspectives, which allows for competing solutions and a diversity of outcomes instead of one single correct answer.&lt;ref name="Donovan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newmann"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herrington, J., &amp; Oliver, R. (2000). An instructional design framework for authentic learning environments.  ''Educational Technology Research and Development,'' 48 (3), 23-48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lombardi"&gt;Lombardi, M. (2007). Authentic learning for the 21st century: An overview. ''EduCause Learning Initiative.'' ELI Paper 1:2007. [https://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ELI3009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mims, C.

The components of authentic learning. ''Journal of Authentic Learning,'' 3 (1), 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Students are provided the opportunity for articulation of their learning process and/or final learning product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herrington|first1=Jan|title=Authentic e-learning in higher education: Designing principles for authentic learning environments and tasks|journal=Key note address at World Conference on E-Learning in Corporate, Government, Healthcare, and Higher Education (ELEARN) 2006|date=October 13–17, 2006|url=http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/5247|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Five standards ==

While there has been much attention given to educational standards for [[curriculum]] and [[Educational assessment|assessment]], "the standards for instruction tend to focus on procedural and technical aspects, with little attention to more fundamental standards of quality."&lt;ref name="Wehlage"&gt;Newmann, F. &amp; Wehlage, G. (1993). Five standards of authentic instruction. ''Educational Leadership,'' 50 (7), 8-12.&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge is not simply to adopt innovative teaching techniques but to give students the opportunity to use their minds well and to provide students with instruction that has meaning or value outside of achieving success in school. 

In order to address this challenge, a framework consisting of five standards of authentic instruction has been developed by Wisconsin's Center on Organization and Restructuring of Schools. This framework can be a valuable tool for both researchers and teachers. It provides "a set of standards through which to view assignments, instructional activities, and the dialogue between teacher and students and students with one another."&lt;ref name="Wehlage" /&gt; 

Teachers can use the framework to generate questions, clarify goals, and critique their teaching. Each standard can be assessed on a scale of one to five rather than a categorical yes or no variable. "The five standards are higher-order thinking, depth of knowledge, connectedness to the world beyond the classroom, substantive conversation, and social support for student achievement."&lt;ref name="Wehlage" /&gt;
*'''Higher-Order Thinking:''' This scale measures the degree to which students use higher-order thinking skills. Higher-order thinking requires students to move beyond simple recall of facts to the more complex task of manipulating information and ideas in ways that transform their meaning and implications, such as when students synthesize, generalize, explain, hypothesize, or arrive at some conclusion or interpretation.
*'''Depth of Knowledge:''' This scale assesses students' depth of knowledge and understanding. Knowledge is considered deep when students are able to "make clear distinctions, develop arguments, solve problems, construct explanations, and otherwise work with relatively complex understandings."&lt;ref name="Wehlage" /&gt; Rather than emphasizing large quantities of fragmented information, instruction covers fewer topics in systematic and connected ways which leads to deeper understanding. 
*'''Connectedness to the World:''' This scale measures the extent to which the instruction has value and meaning beyond the instructional context. Instruction can exhibit connectedness when students address real-world public problems or when they use personal experiences as a context for applying knowledge. 
*'''Substantive Conversation:''' This scale assesses the extent of communication to learn and understand the substance of a subject. High levels of substantive conversation are indicated by three features: considerable interaction about the subject matter which includes evidence of higher-order thinking, sharing of ideas that are not scripted or controlled, and dialogue that builds on participants' ideas to promote improved collective understanding of a theme or topic. 
*'''Social Support for Student Achievement:''' The social support scale measures the culture of the learning community. Social support is high in classes where there are high expectations for all students, a climate of mutual respect, and inclusion of all students in the learning process. Contributions from all students are welcomed and valued.&lt;ref name="Wehlage" /&gt;

== Examples ==

There are several authentic learning practices in which students may participate. These are a few examples:
*'''Simulation-Based Learning:''' Students engage in [[simulations]] and [[role-playing]] in order to be put in situations where the student has to actively participate in the decision making of a project. This helps in "developing valuable communication, collaboration, and leadership skills that would help the student succeed as a professional in the field he/she is studying."&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;Peterson, L. (2007). Authentic Learning Environments. Retrieved April 9, 2014 from http://etec.ctlt.ubc.ca/510wiki/Authentic_Learning_Environments.&lt;/ref&gt; Learning through simulation and role-playing has been used to train flight attendants, fire fighters, and medical personnel to name a few.  
*'''Student-Created Media:''' Student-created media focuses on using various technologies to "create videos, design websites, produce animations, virtual reconstructions, and create photographs."&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt; In addition to gaining valuable experience in working with a range of technologies, "students have also improved their reading comprehension, writing skills, and their abilities to plan, analyze, and interpret results as they progress through the media project."&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;
*'''Inquiry-Based Learning:''' [[Inquiry-based learning]] starts by posing questions, problems or scenarios rather than simply presenting material to students. Students identify and research issues and questions to develop their knowledge or solutions. Inquiry-based learning is generally used in field-work, case studies, investigations, individual and group projects, and research projects. 
*'''Peer-Based Evaluation:''' In peer based evaluation students are given the opportunity to analyze, critique, and provide constructive feedback on the assignments of their peers. Through this process, they are exposed to different perspectives on the topic being studied, giving them a deeper understanding. 
*'''Working with Remote Instruments:''' Specialized software can provide students with opportunities they might not have otherwise. For example, "various software packages produce similar results that students working in a fully equipped lab might receive. By interpreting the software based results students are able to apply theory to practice as they interpret the data that would otherwise not be available to them."&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt; 
*'''Working with Research Data:''' Students collect their own data or use data collected from researchers to conduct their own investigations.
*'''Reflecting and Documenting Achievements:''' The importance of [[metacognition]] in the learning process is well-documented. Giving students the opportunity to reflect upon and monitor their learning is essential. [[Diary|Journals]], [[Artist's portfolio|portfolio]]s, and [[electronic portfolio]]s are examples of authentic learning tasks designed to showcase the student's work as well as give the student a means to reflect back on his/her learning over time.&lt;ref name="Lombardi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peterson"/&gt;
*'''Project-Based Learning:''' Begins with a problem or question that is the starting point for inquiry and which all products are created as a result of. Results in a single or series of products or artifacts that are created as a result or solution to the inquiry.&lt;ref name=ReferenceA/&gt;

== Benefits ==

Educational research shows that authentic learning is an effective learning approach{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} to preparing students for work in the 21st century. By situating knowledge within relevant contexts, learning is enhanced in all four domains of learning: [[cognitive]] (knowledge), [[affective]] (attitudes), [[psychomotor learning|psychomotor]] (skills), and [[psychosocial]] (social skills). Some of the benefits of authentic learning include the following:
*Students are more motivated and more likely to be interested in what they are learning when it is relevant and applicable to their lives outside of school. 
*Students are better prepared to succeed in college, careers, and adulthood. 
*Students learn to [[assimilation (psychology)|assimilate]] and connect knowledge that is unfamiliar.
*Students are exposed to different settings, activities, and perspectives. 
*[[Knowledge transfer|Transfer]] and application of theoretical knowledge to the world outside of the classroom is enhanced. 
*Students have opportunities to collaborate, produce products, and to practice [[problem solving]] and professional skills.
*Students have opportunities to exercise professional judgments in a safe environment. 
*Students practice higher-order thinking skills.
*Students develop patience to follow longer arguments. 
*Students develop flexibility to work across disciplinary and cultural boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Benefits of Authentic Learning. (n.d.) Curtin University. Retrieved March 5, 2014 from https://otl.curtin.edu.au/teaching_learning_practice/student_centred/authentic.cfm.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany was established in the year 1946, under the name, Institute of [[Palaeobotany]], a progression of the Palaeobotanical society formed by a group of botanists led by the renowned [[India]]n botanist, [[Birbal Sahni|Professor Birbal Sahni]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/BSahni.htm Birbal Sahni&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101124440/http://www.vigyanprasar.gov.in/scientists/BSahni.htm |date=1 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; known as the father of [[Dendrology]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBkr_9aktUo Birbal Sahni, father of the Dendrology - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://archive.is/20140626055259/http://www.sritweets.com/birbal-sahni-father-dendrology-birbal-sahni-extensive-research-paleobotany/ Birbal Sahni, father of the Dendrology| Birbal Sahni did extensive research in Paleobotany&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; who became its first Director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india-religion.net/ India Religion Home Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The initial office of the Institute was at the Department of [[Botany]], [[Lucknow University]]. The then government of the United Provinces gifted a bungalow sitting on 3.50 acres of land to the Institute in 1948, which till today remains its campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.minglebox.com/college/Birbal-Sahni-Institute-of-Palaeobotany-BSIP-Lucknow Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany, Lucknow - Admission, Courses, Fee, Contact Address | BSIP | Lucknow | Uttar Pradesh - Minglebox&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Savitri Sahni, took over the reins of the Institute on her husband's death in 1949 and the Institute moved into a new purpose-built building in 1953. The Institute, by that time, had already started to be known and, in 1951, [[UNESCO]] included it in their Technical Assistance Program. On 9 July 1969, the research activities were alienated from the society and Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany was formed, in honor of the scientist,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; as an independent autonomous research organization funded by the Government of India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundoodata.com/companies-detail/Birbal-Sahni-Institute-of-Palaeobotany-(BSIP)/61661.html Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany (BSIP) - Lucknow - Address Phone no Website Email Turnover - MD CEO HR CFO CIO&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Body hair''', or '''androgenic hair''', is the [[terminal hair]] that develops on the [[human body]] during and after [[puberty]]. It is differentiated from the [[head hair]] and less visible [[vellus hair]], which are much finer and lighter in color. The growth of androgenic hair is related to the level of [[androgen]]s (often referred to as male [[hormone]]s) and the density of androgen receptors in the dermal papillae. Both must reach a threshold for the proliferation of hair follicle cells.

From childhood onward, regardless of [[sex]], vellus hair covers almost the entire area of the [[human body]]. Exceptions exclude the lips; the backs of the ears; the palms of hands; the soles of the feet; certain external [[Sex organ|genital]] areas; the [[navel]]; and [[scar]] tissue. The density of hair –&amp;nbsp;i.e. the number of [[hair follicle]]s per unit area of skin&amp;nbsp;– varies from person to person. In many cases, areas on the human body that contain vellus hair will begin to produce darker and thicker body hair, such as the first growth of [[Beard|beard hair]] on a male and female [[Adolescence|adolescent]]'s previously smooth chin; although it may appear thinner on the female.

Androgenic hair follows the same [[Human hair growth|growth pattern]] as the hair that grows on the scalp, but with a shorter [[Hair follicle#Anagen phase|anagen phase]] and longer [[Hair follicle#Telogen phase|telogen phase]].  While the anagen phase for the hair on one's head lasts for years, the androgenic hair growth phase for body hair lasts a few months. The telogen phase for body hair lasts close to a year.{{Citation needed|reason=Original source unavailabl or removed|date=May 2018}} This shortened growing period and extended dormant period explains why the hair on the head tends to be much longer than other hair found on the body.  Differences in length seen in comparing the hair on the back of the hand and pubic hair, for example, can be explained by varied growth cycles in those two regions.  The same goes for differences in body hair length seen in different people, especially when comparing [[men]] and [[women]].

==Distribution==
Like much of the hair on the human body, leg, arm, chest, and back hair begin as vellus hair.  As people age, the hair in these regions will often begin to grow darker and more abundantly.  This will typically happen during or after puberty.  Men will often have more abundant, coarser hair on the arms and back, while women tend to have a less drastic change in the hair growth in these areas but do experience a significant change in thickness of hairs.  However, some women will grow darker, longer hair in one or more of these regions.

=== Chest and abdomen ===
Vellus hair grows on the chest and abdomen of both sexes at all stages of development.  After puberty and extending into adulthood, most males grow increasing amounts of terminal hair over the chest and abdomen areas.  Adult women also typically can grow terminal hairs around the [[areola]] though in many cultures these hairs are typically removed.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
[[File:Arm hair.jpg|thumb|Arm hair]]

=== Arms ===
Arm hair grows on a human's [[forearms]], sometimes even on the elbow area. Terminal arm hair is concentrated on the wrist end of the forearm, extending over the [[hand]]. Terminal hair growth in adolescent males is often much more intense than that in females, particularly for individuals with dark hair. In some cultures, it is common for women to remove arm hair, though this practice is less frequent than that of leg hair removal.

Terminal hair growth on [[arm]]s is a secondary sexual characteristic in boys and appears in the last stages of puberty.  Vellus arm hair is usually concentrated on the elbow end of the forearm and often ends on the lower part of the [[upper arm]]. This type of intense arm vellus hair growth sometimes occurs in young women and people of both sexes until puberty. Even though this causes the arms to appear hairy, it is not caused solely by testosterone. The hair is softer and different from men's arm hair, in texture.

=== Feet ===
Visible hair appearing on the top surfaces of the feet and [[toes]] generally begins with the onset of puberty. Terminal hair growth on the feet is typically more intense in adult and adolescent males than in females.

=== Legs ===
[[File:Adolescent leg hair.jpg|thumb|Leg hair of an adolescent male]]
Leg hair sometimes appears at the onset of adulthood, with the legs of men more often hairier than those of women. For a variety of reasons, people may [[leg shaving|shave their leg hair]], including cultural practice or individual needs. Around the world, women generally shave their leg hair more regularly than men, to conform with the social norms of many cultures, many of which perceive smooth skin as a sign of youth, beauty, and in some cultures, hygiene. However, athletes of both sexes – [[Swimming (sport)|swimmers]], [[track and field|runners]], [[bicycling|cyclists]] and [[bodybuilding|bodybuilders]] in particular – may shave their androgenic hair to reduce friction, highlight muscular development or to make it easier to get into and out of skin-tight clothing.

===Pubic===
[[Pubic hair]] is a collection of coarse hair found in the pubic region. It will often also grow on the thighs and abdomen. Zoologist [[Desmond Morris]] disputes theories that it developed to signal sexual maturity or protect the skin from chafing during copulation, and prefers the explanation that pubic hair acts as a scent trap. Also, both sexes having thick pubic hairs act as a sort of cushion during intercourse.&lt;ref name="morris-bodywatching"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Desmond|title=Bodywatching: a field guide to the human species|year=1985|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[genital]] area of males and females are first inhabited by shorter, lighter vellus hairs that are next to invisible and only begin to develop into darker, thicker pubic hair at [[puberty]]. At this time, the [[pituitary gland]] secretes [[gonadotropin]] hormones which trigger the production of testosterone in the testicles and ovaries, promoting pubic hair growth. The average ages pubic hair begins to grow in males and females are 12 and 11, respectively. However, in some females, pubic hair has been known to start growing as early as age 7.

Just as individual people differ in scalp hair color, they can also differ in pubic hair color. Differences in thickness, growth rate, and length are also evident.

[[Islamic hygienical jurisprudence]] teaches that pubic and armpit hair must be pulled out or shaven to be considered as [[Sunnah]]. Trimming is acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=53EPNr8qeLgC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=Pubic+and+armpit+hair+must+also+be+shaven.+islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ4fuB-7fLAhVQUI4KHbjtBVMQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pubic%20and%20armpit%20hair%20must%20also%20be%20shaven.%20islam&amp;f=false | title=Living in the Shade of Islam: A Comprehensive Reference of Theory and Practice | publisher=Tughra Books | date=2003 | last=Ismail |first=Buyukcelebi | pages=169 | isbn=1-932-09921-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western culture, beginning in the 1980s, there has been a trend among women to remove or trim pubic hair, either partially or completely; the trend later spread to men as well. Fashions for both men and women to either shape or remove pubic hair rise and fall throughout much of history, though it is more often considered as a practice for women alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Looking Through the Bushes: The Disappearance of Pubic Hair|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/roger-friedland/women-pubic-hair_b_875465.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Roger|last=Friedland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armpits===

Underarm hair normally starts to appear at the [[pubarche|beginning]] of [[puberty]], with growth usually completed by the end of the teenage years.

Today in much of the world, it is common for women to regularly [[Shaving|shave]] their underarm hair. The prevalence of this practice varies widely, though. The practice became popular for cosmetic reasons around 1915 in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], when one or more magazines showed a woman in a dress with shaved underarms. As women's armpit hair contrasts more noticeably with her other body hair than does a man's, it is a significant indicator of sexual maturity and therefore unwelcome in conventional western polite society. Regular shaving became feasible with the introduction of the [[safety razor]] at the beginning of the 20th century. While underarm shaving was quickly adopted in some [[English language|English]] speaking countries, especially in the US and [[Canada]], it did not become widespread in [[Europe]] until well after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hope|first=Christine|year=1982|title=Caucasian Female Body Hair and American Culture|journal=Journal of American Culture|volume=5|issue=1|pages=93–99|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.1982.0501_93.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/625/who-decided-women-should-shave-their-legs-and-underarms |title=Who decided women should shave their legs and underarms? |last1=Adams |first1=Cecil |date=1991-02-06 |website=[[The Straight Dope]] |accessdate=2015-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the practice has spread worldwide. Some men also choose to shave their armpits.

===Facial===

[[Facial hair]], as the name suggests, grows primarily on or around one's [[face]]. Both men and women experience facial hair growth. Like pubic hair, non-vellus facial hair will begin to grow in around puberty. [[Moustache]]s in young men usually begin to grow in at around the age of puberty, although some men may not grow a moustache until they reach late teens or at all. For some cases facial hair development may take longer to mature than in the late teens but a lot of men experience no facial development even at an older age. Facial hair development has often been associated with stress levels.

It is common for many women to develop a few facial hairs under or around the chin, along the sides of the face (in the area of sideburns), or on the upper lip. These may appear at any age after puberty but are often seen in women after [[menopause]] due to decreased levels of estrogen. A darkening of the vellus hair of the upper lip in women is not considered true facial hair, though it is often referred to as a "moustache"; the appearance of these dark vellus hairs may be lessened by bleaching. A relatively small number of women are able to grow enough facial hair to have a distinct beard. In some cases, female beard growth is the result of a hormonal imbalance (usually [[androgen]] excess), or a rare genetic disorder known as [[hypertrichosis]].&lt;ref name="congenitallanuginosa"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1072987-overview |title= Congenital Hypertrichosis Lanuginosa|last1= Taylor|first1= Sarah K |date= June 18, 2009 |work= Emedicine|publisher= Medscape |accessdate=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it is caused by use of [[anabolic steroid]]s. Cultural pressure leads most women to remove facial hair, as it may be viewed as a [[social stigma]].

== Development==
{{Main|Human hair growth}}

Hair follicles are to varying degrees sensitive to androgen, primarily [[testosterone]] and its derivatives, particularly [[dihydrotestosterone]], with different areas on the body having different sensitivity. As androgen levels increase, the rate of hair growth and the weight of the hairs increase. Genetic factors determine both individual levels of androgen and the hair follicle's sensitivity to androgen, as well as other characteristics such as hair colour, type of hair and hair retention.

Rising levels of androgen during puberty cause vellus hair to transform into terminal hair over many areas of the body. The sequence of appearance of terminal hair reflects the level of androgen sensitivity, with [[pubic hair]] being the first to appear due to the area's special sensitivity to androgen. The appearance of pubic hair in both sexes is usually seen as an indication of the start of a person's puberty. There is a [[sexual differentiation]] in the amount and distribution of androgenic hair, with men tending to have more terminal hair in more areas. This includes [[facial hair]], [[chest hair]], [[abdominal hair]], [[leg hair]], [[arm hair]], and [[foot hair]]. Women retain more of the less visible vellus hair, although leg, arm, and foot hair can be noticeable on women.  It is not unusual for women to have a few terminal hairs around their nipples as well.
In the later decades of life, especially after the 5th decade, there begins a noticeable reduction in body hair especially in the legs.  The reason for this is not known but it could be due to poorer circulation, lower free circulating hormone amounts or other reasons.

==Function==

Androgenic hair provides tactile sensory input by transferring hair movement and vibration via the shaft to sensory nerves within the skin. Follicular nerves detect displacement of hair shafts and other nerve endings in the surrounding skin detect vibration and distortions of the skin around the follicles.

== Evolution ==
Determining the evolutionary function of androgenic hair must take into account both [[human evolution]] and the thermal properties of hair itself.

The thermodynamic properties of hair are based on the properties of the [[keratin]] strands and [[amino acids]] that combine into a 'coiled' structure. This structure lends to many of the properties of hair, such as its ability to stretch and return to its original length. This coiled structure does not predispose curly or frizzy hair, both of which are defined by oval or triangular hair follicle cross-sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hair-science.com/_int/_en/topic/topic_sousrub.aspx?tc=ROOT-HAIR-SCIENCE%5EAMAZINGLY-NATURAL%5ESHAPE-WORKSHOP&amp;cur=SHAPE-WORKSHOP |title=Hair Shape |publisher=Hair-science.com |date=1 February 2005 |accessdate=18 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222082300/http://www.hair-science.com/_int/_en/topic/topic_sousrub.aspx?tc=ROOT-HAIR-SCIENCE%5EAMAZINGLY-NATURAL%5ESHAPE-WORKSHOP&amp;cur=SHAPE-WORKSHOP |archivedate=22 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of less body hair===
Hair is a very good thermal conductor and aids heat transfer both into and out of the body. When [[goose bumps]] are observed, small muscles ([[Arrector pili muscle]]) contract to raise the hairs both to provide insulation, by reducing cooling by air convection of the skin, as well as in response to central nervous stimulus, similar to the feeling of 'hairs standing up on the back of your neck'. This phenomenon also occurs when static charge is built up and stored in the hair. Keratin however can easily be damaged by excessive heat and dryness, suggesting that extreme sun exposure, perhaps due to a lack of clothing, would result in perpetual hair destruction, eventually resulting in the genes being bred out in favor of high skin [[pigmentation]]. It is also true that parasites can live on and in hair thus peoples who preserved their body hair would have required greater general hygiene to prevent diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hair-science.com/_int/_en/topic/topic_sousrub.aspx?tc=ROOT-HAIR-SCIENCE^SO-STURDY-SO-FRAGILE^PROPERTIES-OF-HAIR^STRONG-HAIR&amp;cur=STRONG-HAIR |title=Properties Of Hair |publisher=Hair-science.com |date=1 February 2005 |accessdate=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Markus J. Rantala of the Department of Biological and Environmental Science, [[University of Jyväskylä]], [[Finland]], said humans evolved by "natural selection" to be hairless when the trade off of "having fewer parasites" became more important than having a "warming, furry coat".&lt;ref name="Rantala" /&gt;

P.E. Wheeler of the Department of Biology at [[Liverpool Polytechnic]] said [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] [[savannah]] [[mammal]]s of similar volume to humans have body hair to keep warm while only larger quadrupedal savannah mammals lack body hair, because their body volume itself is enough to keep them warm.&lt;ref name="Wheeler" /&gt; Therefore, Wheeler said humans who should have body hair based on predictions of body volume alone for savannah mammals evolved no body hair after evolving [[bipedalism]] which he said reduced the amount of body area exposed to the sun by 40%, reducing the solar warming effect on the human body.&lt;ref name="Wheeler"&gt;Wheeler, P.E. (1985). The Loss of Functional Body Hair in Man: the Influence of Thermal Environment, Body Form and Bipedality. Journal of Human Evolution. 14, 23–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss of fur occurred at least 2 million years ago, but possibly as early as 3.3 million years ago judging from the divergence of head and pubic lice, and aided [[persistence hunting]] (the ability to catch prey in very long distance chases) in the warm savannas where hominins first evolved.  The two main advantages are felt to be bipedal locomotion and greater thermal load dissipation capacity due to better sweating and less hair.&lt;ref&gt;Kittler R, Kayser M, Stoneking M: Molecular evolution of Pediculus humanus and the origin of clothing.

===Sexual selection===
{{Main|sexual selection}}

Markus J. Rantala of the Department of Biological and Environmental Science, [[University of Jyväskylä]], [[Finland]], said the existence of [[androgen]] dependent hair on men could be explained by [[sexual attraction]] whereby hair on the genitals would trap [[pheromones]] and hair on the chin would make the chin appear more massive.&lt;ref name="Rantala"&gt;Rantala, M.J.

In 1876,&lt;!--The book's date is 1876.--&gt; [[Oscar Peschel]] wrote that North Asiatic Mongols, Native Americans,&lt;!--Peschel used the ambiguous term "Americans" in his listing of peoples with little to no body hair, but Peschel's usage of the term "Americans" is in reference to Native Americans. Peschel's meaning of the term "Americans" is shown in a different part of the book from the context of the first sentence of the second paragraph of page 403 when Peschel said, "Those writers who separate the Americans as a peculiar race fail to give them distinctive characters, common to them all, which distinguish them from Asiatic Mongols."--&gt; Malays, Hottentots and Bushmen have little to no body hair,&lt;!--In the second sentence of the second paragraph of page 96, Peschel said, "Its scantiness or entire absence in North Asiatic Mongols, in American and Malay families, as well as in Hottentots and Bushmen, afford some of the most persistent and best authenticated racial characters, only it must be added that the natural baldness of the body is artificially exaggerated by the careful extraction of single hairs."--&gt; while Semitics, Indo-Europeans, and Southern Europeans (especially the Portuguese and Spanish) have extensive body hair.&lt;!--In the third and fourth sentences of the first paragraph of page 97, Peschel said, "A luxuriant growth of hair on the body is one of the distinctive marks of the Semitic as well as of the Indo-European families. In Southern Europeans, especially in Portuguese and Spaniards, this character is most strongly developed."--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peschel, O. (1876). The Races of Man and Their Geographical Distribution.

According to [[Ashley Montagu]] who taught anthropology at Princeton University,  [[Asian people]] and [[black people]] such as the [[San people]]  are less hairy than [[white people]].

Eike-Meinrad Winkler and Kerrin Christiansen of the Institut für Humanbiologie, [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]], did a study using [[Kavango people|Kavango]] people and [[!Kung]] people of body hair and hormone levels to investigate the reason [[black Africans]] did not have bodies as hairy as [[Europeans]].&lt;ref name="Winkler" /&gt; Winkler and Christiansen concluded the difference in hairiness between black Africans and Europeans had to do with differences in [[androgen]] or [[estradiol]] production, in androgen [[metabolism]], and in [[sex hormone]] action in the target cells.&lt;ref name="Winkler"&gt;Winkler, E.-M. and Christiansen, K.

'''Castleton University''', formerly known as '''Castleton State College''', is a public [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]], located in [[Castleton, Vermont|Castleton]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Vermont]]. Castleton has an enrollment of 2000 students and offers more than 30 undergraduate programs, as well as master's degrees in education and accounting. The college is accredited by the [[New England Association of Schools and Colleges]].

==History==
[[File:Castleton state college Woodruff Hall.jpg|thumb|Woodruff Hall.]]
Castleton University traces its history to the Rutland County Grammar School, chartered by the [[Vermont General Assembly]] on October 15, 1787.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.castleton.edu/about-castleton/our-campus/|title=A Brief History of Castleton|last=|first=|date=|year=2010|website=|publisher=Castleton State College|accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Grammar School was a regional school, preparing young men for college through instruction in traditional academic subjects such as Latin and Greek. The institution frequently changed its name during the 19th century. At various times it was known as Castleton Academy, Castleton Academy and Female Seminary, Vermont Classical High School, and Castleton Seminary.{{sfn|Peffer|pp=317–318}}

In 1823, instruction in "the solid branches of female education" began for "young Ladies and Misses". By the time of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the majority of the students attending Castleton were young women.{{sfn|Peffer|pp=20, 42}}

In 1829, a three-story brick building costing US$30,000 was constructed on a small hill south of the village. Principal [[Solomon Foot]] (1826–1829), who would go on to be [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President ''pro tempore'' of the U.S. Senate]] during the Civil War, was the driving force in this expansion of the school. The Seminary Building (eventually known as the Old Seminary Building) was the most impressive structure in the village, but expensive to maintain and often too large for the school's struggling enrollment.{{sfn|Peffer|pp=21-25}}

Castleton Medical College (1818–1862) was also located in the village. It graduated 1400 students, more than any other medical school in [[New England]] at the time. Although Castleton Medical College and Castleton Seminary were separate institutions, they often shared faculty. Today the former medical college building, known as the Old Chapel, is the oldest building on the campus.&lt;ref&gt;Waite, Frederick Clayton. ''The First Medical College in Vermont: Castleton 1818–1862''. Vermont Historical Society (1949).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first female principal was Harriet Haskell (1862–1867). She had attended the Seminary as a child, took classes at [[Middlebury College]] without being permitted to matriculate, and then attended [[Mount Holyoke Female Seminary]], which was not yet a college but offered a college-level curriculum for women. Although Haskell was in her 20s when she served as principal, the school flourished under her administration. With her departure to be principal of Monticello Ladies Seminary in [[Godfrey, Illinois]], Castleton Seminary went into decline.{{sfn|Peffer|pp=36-45}}

[[File:Castleton Vermont 20040701.jpg|thumb|Built in 1821, Old Chapel ([[Castleton Medical College Building]]) is the oldest building on the Castleton campus.]]
The school began its transition to a college in 1867, when the '''State Normal School at Castleton''' was founded as one of three state [[normal schools]] chartered by Vermont.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.castleton.edu/content.php?catoid=4&amp;navoid=148|title=About the College - Castleton State College - Acalog ACMS™|website=catalog.castleton.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normal schools educated students for teaching careers. For 30 years the Normal School property and grounds were privately owned by [[Abel E. Leavenworth]] and his son Philip. In 1912, the State of Vermont purchased the property.&lt;ref name="Duffy"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=John Duffy |editor2=Samuel H |editor3=Ralph Orth|title=The Vermont Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTBCXqOou0YC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;lpg=PA78&amp;dq=caroline+woodruff+castleton&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AKPOakdxVX&amp;sig=v2Ce7OXqc0I1ouBvUpfwy_twGFY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GAk2T6fEEuOW0QHu3sjKAg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=caroline%20woodruff%20castleton&amp;f=false|year=2003|publisher=University Press of New England|location=Burlington, Vt.|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s and 1930s, under the direction of [[Caroline Woodruff]], the College experienced dramatic growth in students and its stature. Woodruff modernized the school's curriculum, incorporating the theories of Vermont educator-philosopher [[John Dewey]], especially his precepts of "learning by doing" and "learning by teaching". She hired staff with advanced degrees, and broadened her students' exposure to the world by bringing people such as [[Helen Keller]], [[Robert Frost]], and [[Norman Rockwell]] to Castleton. Woodruff was the first and only Vermonter to become president of the [[National Education Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.castleton.edu/academics/catalog1112.pdf|title=Undergraduate Catalog 2011&amp;ndash;12|last=|first=|date=2011|website=|publisher=Castleton State College|page=5|access-date=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, the Normal School became '''Castleton Teachers College'''. With increased enrollment from men, intercollegiate athletics began in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

In 1962, the institution became '''Castleton State College''' when it joined other state-supported colleges in becoming a part of the [[Vermont State Colleges]], a consortium of colleges governed by a common board of trustees, chancellor, and [[Council of Presidents]], each college having its own president and deans.&lt;ref name=VSCManual&gt;''Vermont State Colleges Manual of Policies and Procedures, Section A: Statute and By-Laws''.

In 1979, the Board of Trustees proposed a name change to '''Southern Vermont State College'''. The proposal was never acted on.{{Sfn|Peffer|pp=238-239}} On July 23, 2015, the Vermont State Colleges Board of Trustees voted unanimously to change the name of the institution to '''Castleton University'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wcax.com/story/29617172/csc-becomes-castleton-university|title=CSC becomes Castleton University|last=Crawford|first=Logan|date=July 23, 2015|work=[[WCAX]]|location=[[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington, Vt.]]|accessdate=2015-07-24|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724164222/http://www.wcax.com/story/29617172/csc-becomes-castleton-university|archivedate=July 24, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academics ==

=== Natural sciences department ===
The Natural Sciences Department is located in the Jeffords Science Center, named after the late U.S. Senator [[Jim Jeffords]]. It is the largest department on campus, with 12 faculty members, all with terminal degrees in their field. Students have the option of seven different majors, in Biology, Chemistry, Ecological Studies, Environmental Science, Exercise Science, Geology and Health Science. The department is active with $538,823 in external grant funding from the [[National Institutes of Health]]-VGN and the [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref name=VGN2014&gt;{{cite web|title=VGN Funded Faculty Pilot Project Grants at Baccalaureate Partner Institutions, INBRE 2014|url=http://vgn.uvm.edu/content/pilot-project-grants-baccalaureate-faculty-inbre-2014|publisher=Vermont Genetics Network|year=2014|accessdate=Aug 14, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402101533/http://vgn.uvm.edu/content/pilot-project-grants-baccalaureate-faculty-inbre-2014|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NSF2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Award Detail: Vermont State Colleges|url=http://www.research.gov/research-portal/appmanager/base/desktop;jsessionid=pPQ3T6JLVp0pcL2Xx6KhDGbQhDhynb7qCpph6DKZ0p6crqJhtrc4!245690187!1224829036?_nfpb=true&amp;_windowLabel=rsrRecentAwards_2&amp;wsrp-urlType=blockingAction&amp;wsrp-url=&amp;wsrp-requiresRewrite=&amp;wsrp-navigationalState=eJyLL07OL0i1Tc-JT0rMUYNQtgBZ6Af8&amp;wsrp-interactionState=wlprsrRecentAwards_2_action%3DviewRsrDetail%26wlprsrRecentAwards_2_fedAwrdId%3D1419852&amp;wsrp-mode=wsrp%3Aview&amp;wsrp-windowState=|publisher=National Science Foundation|year=2014|accessdate=Aug 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History, geography, economics, and politics department ===
The department offers majors and minors in history, political science, and global studies, a major in social studies, contract majors in social sciences (with primary concentrations in Geography, Economics, and Environmental Studies), minors in Geography, Economics, and Environmental Studies, and a certificate in Global Studies.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://catalog.castleton.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=13&amp;ent_oid=157&amp;returnto=891 History, Geography, Economics, and Politics Department]," Castleton University 2016-17 Undergraduate Program (Retrieved May 11, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Castleton Polling Institute==
In 2012, Castleton began the Castleton Polling Institute with an initial investment of $100,000. The first poll was conducted from February 11 to February 22, 2012 and polled Vermont voters about the 2012 Presidential Primaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/will-a-new-polling-institute-put-castleton-state-college-on-the-map/Content?oid=2183795|title=Will a New Polling Institute Put Castleton State College on the Map?|last=Heintz|first=Paul|date=March 12, 2014|work=[[Seven Days (newspaper)|Seven Days]]|location=[[Burlington, Vermont|Burlington, Vt.]]|access-date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Polling&gt;{{cite web|title=Vermont Voters &amp; the 2012 Presidential Primaries |url=http://www.castleton.edu/about-castleton/the-castleton-polling-institute/poll-results/vermont-voters-the-2012-presidential-primaries|publisher=Castleton State College|year=2012 |accessdate=Feb 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first poll, the Polling Institute has conducted over 30 public opinion and public policy polls for state agencies, non-profits, and media organizations.

The Castleton State Spartans compete in 20 [[NCAA Division III]] Varsity sports in the [[Little East Conference]] and the [[Eastern College Athletic Conference]] (ECAC). Castleton was also the 1963 [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] [[Division III (NCAA)|Division III]] Men's [[soccer]] National Champions. From 1983-1986, [[Stan Van Gundy]] (later head coach of the [[Orlando Magic]] and the [[Detroit Pistons]]) coached Men's Basketball at Castleton. Castleton started a football team for the 2009 season as a member of the newly formed [[Eastern Collegiate Football Conference]].

Castleton's men's soccer team were declared 1963 NAIA co-champions (along with [[Earlham College]] of Indiana) after the championship and consolation games at [[Frostburg State University]], [[Maryland]] were cancelled due to snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naia.org/fls/27900/1NAIA/SportsInfo/Championships/MSOC_Championship.pdf?SPSID=646079&amp;SPID=100398&amp;DB_LANG=C&amp;DB_OEM_ID=27900|publisher=[[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]]|title=Men's Soccer Championship Records|accessdate=September 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''cat organ''' or '''cat piano''' ({{lang-de|Katzenorgel}} or ''Katzenklavier'', {{lang-fr|orgue à chats}} or ''piano à chats/piano chats'') is a hypothetical [[musical instrument]] which consists of a line of [[cat]]s fixed in place with their tails stretched out underneath a [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] so that they [[cat communication|cry out]] when a key is pressed. The cats would be arranged according to the natural [[pitch (music)|tone]] of their voices.

==Origins==

There is no official record of a cat organ actually being built; rather it is described in literature as a bizarre concept. "The details of the cat organ present it clearly as an instrument cat lovers might wish was a fictional horror."&lt;ref name="Betancourt"&gt;Betancourt, Michael (2011). {{Cite web |url=http://vagueterrain.net/content/2011/05/birth-sampling |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-04-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602011022/http://vagueterrain.net/content/2011/05/birth-sampling# |archive-date=2013-06-02 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is used in stories which criticize the cruelty of royalty while the [[piganino]], a similar instrument using pigs, has been used to criticize the poor.

This instrument was described by the French writer [[Jean-Baptiste Weckerlin]] in his book ''Musiciana, extraits d’ouvrages rare ou bizarre'' (Musiciana, descriptions of rare or bizarre inventions):&lt;ref&gt;Weckerlin, Jean-Baptiste (1877). ''Musiciana, extraits d'ouvrages rare ou bizarre'', p.349. Paris: Garnier Freres. Cited in {{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=diEVidYxO7cC&amp;pg=PA195 |title=The Tiger In The House |first=Carl|last=Van Vechten|isbn=9781417967445 |date=2004-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|When the King of Spain [[Philip II of Spain|Felipe II]] was in [[Brussels]] in 1549 visiting his father the [[Emperor Charles V]], each saw the other rejoicing at the sight of a completely singular procession. At the head marched an enormous bull whose horns were burning, between which there was also a small devil. Behind the bull a young boy sewn into a bear skin rode on a horse whose ears and tail were cut off. Then came the archangel Saint Michael in bright clothing, and carrying a balance in his hand.

The most curious was on a chariot that carried the most singular music that can be imagined. It held a bear that played the organ; instead of pipes, there were sixteen cat heads each with its body confined; the tails were sticking out and were held to be played as the strings on a piano, if a key was pressed on the keyboard, the corresponding tail would be pulled hard, and it would produce each time a lamentable [[meow]]. The historian [[Juan Christoval Calvete]], noted the cats were arranged properly to produce a succession of notes from the octave... ([[chromatic scale|chromatically]], I think).

This abominable orchestra arranged itself inside a theatre where monkeys, wolves, deer and other animals danced to the sounds of this infernal music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weckerlin|first=Jean-Baptiste|authorlink=Jean-Baptiste Weckerlin|title=Musiciana, extraits d’ouvrages rare ou bizarre|location=Paris|date=1877|page=349}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The instrument was described by German physician [[Johann Christian Reil]] (1759–1813) for the purpose of treating patients who had lost the ability to focus their attention. Reil believed that if they were forced to see and listen to this instrument, it would inevitably capture their attention and they would be cured: "A fugue played on this instrument--when the ill person is so placed that he cannot miss the expression on their faces and the play of these animals--must bring Lot's wife herself from her fixed state into conscious awareness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.uchicago.edu/research/jnl-crit-inq/issues/v24/v24n3.richards.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-05-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606101253/http://www.uchicago.edu/research/jnl-crit-inq/issues/v24/v24n3.richards.html# |archive-date=2011-06-06 |dead-url=bot: unknown |df= }} from Richards, Robert J. "Rhapsodies on a Cat-Piano, or [[Johann Christian Reil]] and the Foundations of Romantic Psychiatry", 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The instrument was first described by [[Athanasius Kircher]] in his 1650 work ''Musurgia Universalis'', though the lack of an image may have left doubt in the minds of some writers. (''The New York Times'', for example, has carried an article claiming he described the instrument,&lt;ref name=NYT1&gt;{{Citation | last = Boxer| first = Sarah| title = A Postmodernist Of the 1600s Is Back in Fashion| newspaper = The New York Times | publication-place = New York| date = 25 May 2002| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/25/arts/a-postmodernist-of-the-1600-s-is-back-in-fashion.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another stating he did not describe it in ''Musurgia Universalis''.&lt;ref name=NYT2&gt;{{Citation | last = Schuessler| first = Jennifer| title = A 17th-Century Genius, a Quack, or Perhaps Both | newspaper = The New York Times | publication-place = New York| date = 30 December 2012| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/31/books/a-man-of-misconceptions-by-john-glassie.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;). His description appears in Book 6, Part 4, Chapter 1, under the heading "Corollaria," (emphasis added):

[[Image:katzenkavalier.jpg|right|250px|thumb|from Gaspar Schott, ''Magia Naturalis'' (1657)]]

The citation is noted by Kircher's student [[Gaspar Schott]] in ''Magia Naturalis naturae et artis,'' Part 2, Book 6, Pragmatia 2, titled "Felium Musicam exhibere [Cat Concert]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gaspar|last=Schott|authorlink=Gaspar Schott|title=Magia universals naturae et artis|date=1657}}: [http://lhldigital.lindahall.org/cdm/ref/collection/philsci/id/20194 Text] and [http://lhldigital.lindahall.org/cdm/ref/collection/philsci/id/20194 Image] at Linda Hall Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Betancourt]] compares the [[sampling (music)|sampling]] of cats' meows used in [[Jingle Cats]]' albums, ''Meowy Christmas'' (1993) and ''Here Comes Santa Claws'' (1994), to the cat organ,&lt;ref name="Betancourt"/&gt; in that both require cats, but diminish each performer's importance.

Kircher notes that the instrument can be used to reduce the melancholy of princes by moving them to laughter, almost exactly the situation that occurred in 2010 when [[Prince Charles]] was greatly amused by a performance of the tune "[[Over the Rainbow]]" on an instrument recreated using [[squeaky toy]] cats by [[Henry Dagg]] for a [[garden party]] held at [[Clarence House]] supporting Charles's [[Start Initiative|Start]] initiative for sustainable living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11273342 |title=Prince Charles' laughter over 'cat organ' |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1310898/Prince-Charles-interviewed-Daybreak-Adrian-Chiles-Christine-Bleakley.html |title=Please stop, one's sides are splitting! |first=Fay|last=Schlesing |date=11 September 2010 |journal=[[Daily Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009, [[The People's Republic of Animation]], a professional animation studio, released an animation titled ''[[The Cat Piano]]''. This work tells the tale of a city of cats whose musicians are kidnapped by a human in order to make a cat piano. This short film has received several awards, as well as nominations for awards. The Academy announced that it was shortlisted for an Oscar for Best Animated Short. However, it was not nominated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4512">'''Cluster criticism''' is a method of [[rhetorical criticism]] in which a critic examines the structural relations and associative meanings between certain main ideas, concepts, or subjects present in a text. 

==Method== 
There are three steps in performing a cluster criticism: identifying key terms, creating clusters from associated elements, and examining and comparing clusters.&lt;ref name="isbn1-57766-318-7"&gt;{{cite book |author=Foss, Sonja K. |title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice |publisher=Waveland Pr Inc |location= |year=1996 |chapter=Cluster Criticism |pages=367–70 |isbn=1-57766-318-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Identify Key Terms===
First, key terms are identified.  These are generally the ideas, subjects, topics, or arguments that work discusses.  They usually (but not always) occur more often than any other element in the work; they can also be identified in a work's introduction.  
===Create Clusters from Associated Elements===
Next, the critic identifies surrounding elements in the text that refer to or are associated with each of the key terms.  Each collection of associated elements which refer to the same key term is called a cluster.  
===Examine and Compare Clusters===
In the final step of the criticism, the critic examines how each specific cluster represents its referring key term.  This process typically includes directly contrasting one cluster with another.  By doing this, a critic can determine how a text privileges one key term over others.

This stage of cluster criticism can incorporate other methods in [[rhetorical criticism]].  For example, if different types of [[metaphor]]s are found in different clusters, a critic can perform multiple [[metaphoric criticism]]s in order to show how each key term characterizes a particular position or entity.

==Example==
The following is an excerpt from a speech titled [[s:Americanism (Harding)|"Americanism"]] given by [[Warren G. Harding]] in 1920 regarding aid to European nations devastated by World War I.  Terms '''bolded''' are those a critic might associate with the key term "Old World stabilization" and terms &lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt; are those a critic might associate with the key term "stabilize America."
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It's time to '''idealize''', but it's very &lt;u&gt;practical&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;make sure&lt;/u&gt; our own &lt;u&gt;house&lt;/u&gt; is in perfect &lt;u&gt;order&lt;/u&gt; before we '''attempt''' the '''miracle''' of '''Old World stabilization'''. Call it the &lt;u&gt;selfishness of nationality&lt;/u&gt; if you will. I think it's an &lt;u&gt;inspiration&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;patriotic devotion&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;safeguard&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;, to &lt;u&gt;stabilize America&lt;/u&gt; first, to &lt;u&gt;prosper&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;, to &lt;u&gt;think&lt;/u&gt; of &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;, to &lt;u&gt;exalt&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;, to &lt;u&gt;live&lt;/u&gt; for and &lt;u&gt;revere&lt;/u&gt; &lt;u&gt;America first&lt;/u&gt;. Let the '''internationalist''' '''dream''' and the '''Bolshevist''' '''destroy'''.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In this example, the critic would examine the cluster of words and phrases around the key term "Old world stabilization" in order to find certain patterns.  Terms like idealize, miracle, dream, and attempt depict reconstruction through aid as an unproven strategy; internationalist and Bolshevist characterize supporters of aid as foreign and Communist; and the ending word 'destroy' implies a disastrous consequence for the proposal.  In all, a critic can assume that these clusters work together to present aid for European reconstruction as an irresponsible and un-American plan. 

In stark contrast, the terms in the cluster around "stabilize America" construct a rejection of the proposal as the only responsible and American choice.  Terms like make sure, think, practical, order, safeguard, live, and prosper construct a refusal of European reconstruction as safe and sensible.  The words inspiration, exalt, and revere function with the phrases "patriotic devotion" and "selfishness of nationality" to characterize a refusal of aid as a positive, patriotic act.  Finally, the repeated phrase "America first" dichotomizes the issue into a choice between placing America or Europe first, with no middle ground.

The conclusion of this cluster criticism would therefore be that Harding advances his argument by constructing European aid as an irresponsible and un-American policy and a rejection of aid as a responsible, pro-American policy as well as framing the issue as an irreconcilable choice between the interests of America and Europe.

[[File:Columbus Control Center at DLR Oberpfaffenhoffen (8182061318).jpg|thumb|Interior of the Columbus Control Centre.]]
The '''Columbus Control Centre''' is the [[Mission Control Center]] which is used to control the [[ESA|European]] [[Columbus (ISS module)|''Columbus'']] research laboratory, which is part of the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). The control centre is located at the [[German Aerospace Center]] (DLR) facility in [[Oberpfaffenhofen]] near [[Munich]], [[Germany]]. The centre is operated by the DLR, under contract from the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA).

The Columbus Control Centre entered full-time operation during the [[STS-122|STS-122 Shuttle Mission]], which delivered the [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]] module to the ISS.  The module was attached to the ISS on 11 February 2008.

== Identification and call sign ==
The Columbus Control Centre is known by the acronym COL-CC.  The crew on board the [[International Space Station]] use the call sign 'Munich' when calling down to COL-CC.

== Flight Control Room positions ==
The Col-CC Flight Control Room is permanently staffed by three full times positions, COL FLIGHT, STRATOS (a merger of COL SYSTEMS and COL DMS), and GC.  These are supported by COMET during the day 7 days a week as well as EUROCOM and COSMO during crew wake times, Monday to Friday.  COL FLIGHT is responsible for real time Columbus Operations and reports to ISS FLIGHT at [[MCC-H]].  COMET (formerly COL OC (Operations Coordinator)) coordinates Payload operations and real time planning as part of the EPIC team.  STRATOS controls the onboard power, thermal and environmental subsystems plus the onboard data and video subsystems.  EUROCOM is the interface to the [[International Space Station]] crew, communicating over the space to ground loops.  COSMO (COlumbus Stowage and Maintenance Officer) is responsible for inventory management, on-orbit  maintenance and Plug in Plan.

== Support to USOCs and ATV missions ==
The Columbus Control Centre is also responsible for providing the [[Ground Segment]] Services for all European manned space flight activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.esa.int/esaHS/ESAOYJ0VMOC_iss_2.html | title = ESA Control Centres | publisher = ESA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes connecting the User Support Operations Centres (USOCs) with the Columbus Control Centre, and routing data for the [[Automated Transfer Vehicle]]s (ATVs) to the ATV Control Centre located in Toulouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cnes.fr/web/3679-atv-cc.php | title = ATV-CC | publisher = CNES}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[ESA]] will use the ATVs to bring supplies and future science experiments to the ISS. The Columbus Control Centre, "will supervise the ISS-based tasks of the unmanned European space transporter ATV."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dlr.de/iss/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1417/2048_read-3535/ | title = Columbus Control Center - Europe's link to the ISS | publisher = DLR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is black, slightly weathered to a dark brown near the base. It is around 7 meters (22 feet) tall. It stands upon a raised circular base of stone, and is surrounded by a short, square fence.|The [[iron pillar of Delhi]] is an example of the iron extraction and processing methodologies of [[India]]. It has withstood corrosion for the last 1600 years.]]The '''conservation and restoration of iron and steel objects''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of objects of historical and personal value made from [[iron]] or [[steel]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].

Historically, objects made from iron or steel were created for religious, artistic, technical, military and domestic uses. The act of [[conservation and restoration]] strives to prevent and slow the deterioration of the object as well as protecting the object for future use. The prevention and removal of surface dirt and corrosion products are the primary concerns of conservator-restorers when dealing with iron or steel objects, including nickel-iron meteorites.

==Conservation==
Systematic and well-managed documentation is today an essential prerequisite for quality executed conservation and restoration treatments, including  documentation of the state of objects before, during and after treatment. Identification of  materials and procedures used to produce objects and the results of any scientific research  must be part of documentation, too. Last but not least, an integral part of the documentation must be a recommendation for further care of object.

===Identification of metals and alloys===
*Simple methods - visual examination,spot tests,specific gravity
*Scientific methods - [[X-ray fluorescence|XRF]], [[X-ray crystallography|XRD]], [[Particle-induced X-ray emission]], [[LIBS]], [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]], electrochemical techniques, [[metallography]]

===Identification of corrosion processes and products===
*Simple method - visual examination, spot tests
*[[Oddy test|The Oddy test]] - for copper, silver, and lead
*Scientific methods - xrd, SEM, metallography

===Identification of materials associated with metals===
*Simple methods - visual examination, spot tests, specific gravity
*Scientific  methods - xrf, [[chromatography]]

===Identification of technology used to  produce objects===
*Simple  methods - visual examination
*Scientific methods - metallography, [[x-ray radiography]], [[x-ray computed tomography]]

===Decision making===
In preparing the strategy  of the metals conservation project   interdisciplinary approach to the same is essential.It implies the participation of as many experts as is possible, as a minimum, we can take curator (archaeologist, historian, art historian), scientists specialized for corrosion of metallic objects of cultural heritage and the conservator - restorer.

===Cleaning===
Painted objects must be cleaned with polar/non polar solvents or solvent mixtures.

===Structural consolidation===
Screws, rivets, gluing, soldering, welding may be used to conserve the structure.

===Protective coatings===
*Clearcoats - [[Paraloid B-72]] - Permalac - Ormocer
*Waxes - [[Renaissance Wax]] - Cosmolloid 80 H - Dinitrol 4010 - Poligen ES 91009
*Oils - [[Ballistol]] - [[WD-40]] - 8 parts white spirit/2 parts fish oil
*Combinations - basecoat Paraloid B 72 + topcoat Renaissance wax etc.

===Archaeology objects===

====Cleaning====
Only mechanical cleaning can be used(scalpel,micromotor and steel brushes and abrasive discs,microsandblasting unit,ultrasonic chisel).

====Structural consolidation====
Gluing only can be  used,reversible types are the Best.
Glass fibre  reinforcments can be  used too.

==Preventive conservation==
The items should be stored in rooms that are protected from polluted air, dust, ultraviolet radiation, and excessive relative humidity - ideal values are temperature of 16-20&amp;nbsp;°C and up to 40%(35-55% according to recent Canadian Conservation Institute recommendations) relative humidity, noting that if metal is combined with organic materials, relative humidity should not be below 45%. Archaeological objects must be stored in rooms (or plastic boxes)with very low relative humidity, or in the case of particularly valuable items in the chambers with nitrogen or argon. Iron objects with active corrosion up to 12-15% RH. Shelves in the storerooms must be of stainless steel or chlorine and acetate free plastic or powder coated steel. Wood and wood based products(Particle board, plywood) must be avoided. Also do not use rubber, felt or wool .When you are handling metal objects,always wear clean cotton gloves . Lighting levels must be kept below 300 lux (up to 150 lux in case of lacquered or painted objects,up to 50 lux in case of objects with light sensitive materials) [54]

'''Constructivism''' was an [[art]]istic and [[architecture|architectural]] philosophy that originated in [[Russia]] beginning in 1913 by [[Vladimir Tatlin]]. This was a rejection of the idea of autonomous art. He wanted 'to construct' art. The movement was in favour of art as a practice for social purposes. Constructivism had a great effect on modern art movements of the 20th century, influencing major trends such as the [[Bauhaus]] and [[De Stijl]] movements. Its influence was widespread, with major effects upon architecture, [[sculpture]], [[graphic design]], [[industrial design]], theatre, film, dance, fashion and to some extent music.

==Beginnings==

The term ''Construction Art'' was first used as a derisive term by [[Kazimir Malevich]] to describe the work of [[Alexander Rodchenko]] in 1917.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  Constructivism first appears as a positive term in [[Naum Gabo]]'s ''[[Realistic Manifesto]]'' of 1920. [[Aleksei Gan]] used the word as the title of his book ''Constructivism'', printed in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine Cooke, ''Russian Avant-Garde: Theories of Art, Architecture and the City'', Academy Editions, 1995, page 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Constructivism was a post-World War I development of [[Russian Futurism]], and particularly of the 'counter reliefs' of [[Vladimir Tatlin]], which had been exhibited in 1915. The term itself would be invented by the sculptors [[Antoine Pevsner]] and [[Naum Gabo]], who developed an industrial, angular style of work, while its geometric abstraction owed something to the [[Suprematism]] of Kazimir Malevich.

Constructivism as theory and practice was derived largely from a series of debates at the Institute of Artistic Culture ([[INKhUK]]) in Moscow, from 1920 to 1922. After deposing its first chairman, [[Wassily Kandinsky]], for his 'mysticism', The First Working Group of Constructivists (including [[Liubov Popova]], [[Alexander Vesnin]], [[Rodchenko]], [[Varvara Stepanova]], and the theorists [[Aleksei Gan]], [[Boris Arvatov]] and [[Osip Brik]]) would develop a definition of Constructivism as the combination of ''[[faktura]]'': the particular material properties of an object, and ''tektonika'', its spatial presence. Initially the Constructivists worked on three-dimensional constructions as a means of participating in industry: the OBMOKhU (Society of Young Artists) exhibition showed these three dimensional compositions, by Rodchenko, Stepanova, [[Karl Ioganson]] and the [[Stenberg brothers]]. Later the definition would be extended to designs for two-dimensional works such as books or posters, with ''montage'' and ''factography'' becoming important concepts.

==Art in the service of the Revolution==
[[Image:Plakat mayakowski gross.jpg|thumb|right|Agitprop poster by Mayakovsky]] 
As much as involving itself in designs for industry, the Constructivists worked on public festivals and street designs for the post-October revolution Bolshevik government. Perhaps the most famous of these was in [[Vitebsk]], where Malevich's [[UNOVIS]] Group painted propaganda plaques and buildings (the best known being [[El Lissitzky]]'s poster ''[[Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge]]'' (1919)). Inspired by [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]]'s declaration 'the streets our brushes, the squares our palettes', artists and designers participated in public life during the Civil War. A striking instance was the proposed festival for the [[Comintern]] congress in 1921 by Alexander Vesnin and Liubov Popova, which resembled the constructions of the OBMOKhU exhibition as well as their work for the theatre. There was a great deal of overlap during this period between Constructivism and [[Proletkult]], the ideas of which concerning the need to create an entirely new culture struck a chord with the Constructivists. In addition some Constructivists were heavily involved in the 'ROSTA Windows', a Bolshevik public information campaign of around 1920. Some of the most famous of these were by the poet-painter Vladimir Mayakovsky and Vladimir Lebedev.

The constructivists tried to create works that would make the viewer an active viewer of the artwork. In this it had similarities with the [[Russian Formalists]]' theory of 'making strange', and accordingly their main theorist [[Viktor Shklovsky]] worked closely with the Constructivists, as did other formalists like the Arch Bishop. These theories were tested in theatre, particularly with the work of [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]], who had established what he called 'October in the theatre'. Meyerhold developed a 'biomechanical' acting style, which was influenced both by the circus and by the 'scientific management' theories of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]. Meanwhile, the stage sets by the likes of Vesnin, Popova and Stepanova tested Constructivist spatial ideas in a public form. A more populist version of this was developed by [[Alexander Tairov]], with stage sets by [[Aleksandra Ekster]] and the Stenberg brothers. These ideas would influence German directors like [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Erwin Piscator]], as well as the early Soviet cinema.

==Tatlin, 'Construction Art' and Productivism==
The key work of Constructivism was Vladimir Tatlin's proposal for the [[Tatlin's Tower|Monument to the Third International]] (Tatlin's Tower) (1919–20)&lt;ref name=HF&gt;[[Hugh Honour|Honour, H.]] and Fleming, J. (2009) ''A World History of Art''. 7th edn. London: Laurence King Publishing, p. 819. {{ISBN|9781856695848}}&lt;/ref&gt; which combined a machine aesthetic with dynamic components celebrating technology such as searchlights and projection screens. Gabo publicly criticized Tatlin's design saying, "Either create functional houses and bridges or create pure art, not both."  This had already caused a major controversy in the Moscow group in 1920 when Gabo and Pevsner's ''[[Realistic Manifesto]]'' asserted a spiritual core for the movement. This was opposed to the utilitarian and adaptable version of Constructivism held by Tatlin and Rodchenko. Tatlin's work was immediately hailed by artists in Germany as a revolution in art: a 1920 photograph shows [[George Grosz]] and [[John Heartfield]] holding a placard saying 'Art is Dead – Long Live Tatlin's Machine Art', while the designs for the tower were published in [[Bruno Taut]]'s magazine ''Fruhlicht''. The tower was never built, however, due to a lack of money following the revolution.&lt;ref name=Janson&gt;[[H. W. Janson|Janson, H.W.]] (1995) ''History of Art''. 5th edn. Revised and expanded by Anthony F. Janson. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], p. 820. {{ISBN|0500237018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tatlin's tower started a period of exchange of ideas between Moscow and Berlin, something reinforced by El Lissitzky and [[Ilya Ehrenburg]]'s Soviet-German magazine ''Veshch-Gegenstand-Objet'' which spread the idea of 'Construction art', as did the Constructivist exhibits at the 1922 ''Russische Ausstellung'' in Berlin, organised by Lissitzky. A [[Constructivist International]] was formed, which met with Dadaists and De Stijl artists in Germany in 1922. Participants in this short-lived international included Lissitzky, [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], and [[László Moholy-Nagy]]. However the idea of 'art' was becoming anathema to the Russian Constructivists: the INKhUK debates of 1920–22 had culminated in the theory of [[Productivism]] propounded by Osip Brik and others, which demanded direct participation in industry and the end of easel painting. Tatlin was one of the first to attempt to transfer his talents to industrial production, with his designs for an economical stove, for workers' overalls and for furniture. The Utopian element in Constructivism was maintained by his 'letatlin', a flying machine which he worked on until the 1930s.

==Constructivism and consumerism==
In 1921, the [[New Economic Policy]] was established in the Soviet Union, which opened up more market opportunities in the Soviet economy. Rodchenko, Stepanova, and others made advertising for the co-operatives that were now in competition with other commercial businesses. The poet-artist Vladimir Mayakovsky and Rodchenko worked together and called themselves "''advertising constructors''". Together they designed eye-catching images featuring bright colours, geometric shapes, and bold lettering.  The lettering of most of these designs was intended to create a reaction, and function emotionally – most were designed for the state-owned department store [[Mosselprom]] in Moscow, for pacifiers, cooking oil, beer and other quotidian products, with Mayakovsky claiming that his 'nowhere else but Mosselprom' verse was one of the best he ever wrote. 
Additionally, several artists tried to work with clothes design with varying success: Varvara Stepanova designed dresses with bright, geometric patterns that were mass-produced, although workers' overalls by Tatlin and Rodchenko never achieved this and remained prototypes. The painter and designer [[Lyubov Popova]] designed a kind of Constructivist [[flapper]] dress before her early death in 1924, the plans for which were published in the journal ''[[LEF (journal)|LEF]]''. In these works, Constructivists showed a willingness to involve themselves in fashion and the mass market, which they tried to balance with their Communist beliefs.

==LEF and Constructivist cinema==
[[Image:Aelita screenshot.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Constructivist Martian set in ''[[Aelita]]'' (1924)]]
The Soviet Constructivists organised themselves in the 1920s into the 'Left Front of the Arts',  who produced the influential journal ''LEF'', (which had two series, from 1923–5 and from 1927–9 as ''New LEF''). LEF was dedicated to maintaining the avant-garde against the critiques of the incipient [[Socialist Realism]], and the possibility of a capitalist restoration, with the journal being particularly scathing about the 'NEPmen', the capitalists of the period. For LEF the new medium of cinema was more important than the easel painting and traditional narratives that elements of the Communist Party were trying to revive then. Important Constructivists were very involved with cinema, with Mayakovsky acting in the film ''The Young Lady and the Hooligan'' (1919), Rodchenko's designs for the intertitles and animated sequences of [[Dziga Vertov]]'s ''Kino Eye'' (1924), and [[Aleksandra Ekster]] designs for the sets and costumes of the science fiction film ''[[Aelita]]'' (1924).

The Productivist theorists Osip Brik and [[Sergei Tretyakov (writer)|Sergei Tretyakov]] also wrote screenplays and intertitles, for films such as [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]]'s ''Storm over Asia'' (1928) or Victor Turin's ''Turksib'' (1929). The filmmakers and LEF contributors Dziga Vertov and [[Sergei Eisenstein]] as well as the documentarist [[Esfir Shub]] also regarded their fast-cut, montage style of filmmaking as Constructivist. The early [[Eccentrist]] movies of  [[Grigori Kozintsev]] and [[Leonid Trauberg]] (''[[The New Babylon]]'', ''[[Alone (1931 film)|Alone]]'') had similarly avant-garde intentions, as well as a fixation on jazz-age America which was characteristic of the philosophy, with its praise of slapstick-comedy actors like [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]], as well as of [[Fordist]] mass production. Like the photomontages and designs of Constructivism, early [[Soviet film|Soviet cinema]] concentrated on creating an agitational effect by montage and 'making strange'.

==Photography and photomontage==
The Constructivists were early developers of the techniques of [[photomontage]]. Gustav Klutsis' 'Dynamic City' and 'Lenin and Electrification' (1919–20) are the first examples of this method of montage, which had in common with [[Dadaism]] the collaging together of news photographs and painted sections. However Constructivist montages would be less 'destructive' than those of Dadaism. Perhaps the most famous of these montages was Rodchenko's illustrations of the Mayakovsky poem ''About This''.

LEF also helped popularise a distinctive style of photography, involving jagged angles and contrasts and an abstract use of light, which paralleled the work of [[László Moholy-Nagy]] in Germany: the major practitioners of this included, along with Rodchenko, [[Boris Ignatovich]] and [[Max Penson]], among others. This also shared many characteristics with the early documentary movement.

==Constructivist graphic design==
[[File:'Proun Vrashchenia' by El Lissitzky, ca. 1919.jpg|thumb|'Proun Vrashchenia' by [[El Lissitzky]], 1919]]
The book designs of Rodchenko, El Lissitzky and others such as [[Solomon Telingater]] and [[Anton Lavinsky]] were a major inspiration for the work of radical designers in the West, particularly [[Jan Tschichold]]. Many Constructivists worked on the design of posters for everything from cinema to political propaganda: the former represented best by the brightly coloured, geometric posters of the Stenberg brothers (Georgii and Vladimir Stenberg), and the latter by the agitational photomontage work of [[Gustav Klutsis]] and [[Valentina Kulagina]].

In [[Cologne]] in the late 1920s [[Figurative Constructivism]] emerged from the [[Cologne Progressives]], a group which had links with Russian Constructivists, particularly Lissitzky, since the early twenties. Through their collaboration with [[Otto Neurath]] and the [[Gesellschafts- und Wirtschaftsmuseum]] such artists as [[Gerd Antz]], [[Augustin Tschinkel]] and [[Peter Alma]] they affected the development of the [[Isotype (picture language)|Vienna Method]]. This link was most clearly shown in ''A bis Z'' a journal published by [[Franz Seiwert]] the principal theorist of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Benus B. (2013) 'Figurative Constructivism and sociological graphics' in ''Isotype: Design and Contexts 1925-71'' London: Hyphen Press, pp.216-248&lt;/ref&gt; They were active in Russia working with [[IZOSTAT]] and Tschinkel worked with [[Ladislav Sutnar ]] before he emigrated to the US.

The Constructivists' main early political patron was [[Leon Trotsky]], and it began to be regarded with suspicion after the expulsion of Trotsky and the Left Opposition in 1927-8. The [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] would gradually favour realist art during the course of the 1920s (as early as 1918 ''[[Pravda]]'' had complained that government funds were being used to buy works by untried artists). However it was not until about 1934 that the counter-doctrine of [[Socialist Realism]] was instituted in Constructivism's place. Many Constructivists continued to produce avantgarde work in the service of the state, such as Lissitzky, Rodchenko and Stepanova's designs for the magazine ''[[USSR In Construction]]''.

==Constructivist architecture==
{{main|Constructivist architecture}}

Constructivist architecture emerged from the wider constructivist art movement. After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] it turned its attentions to the new social demands and industrial tasks required of the new regime. Two distinct threads emerged, the first was encapsulated in Antoine Pevsner's and Naum Gabo's ''[[Realist manifesto]]'' which was concerned with space and rhythm, the second represented a struggle within the [[Narkompros|Commissariat for Enlightenment]] between those who argued for ''pure art'' and the [[Productivism (art)|Productivists]] such as Alexander Rodchenko, Varvara Stepanova and Vladimir Tatlin, a more socially oriented group who wanted this art to be absorbed in industrial production.&lt;ref name="thought"&gt;{{Cite book| last = Oliver Stallybrass | first = and Alan Bullock (et al.) | title = The Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought | year = 1988 | type = Paperback | publisher = Fontana press | isbn = 0-00-686129-6 | page = 918 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A split occurred in 1922 when Pevsner and Gabo emigrated. The movement then developed along socially [[utilitarian]] lines. The productivist majority gained the support of the [[Proletkult]] and the magazine LEF, and later became the dominant influence of the architectural group [[OSA Group|O.S.A.]], directed by [[Alexander Vesnin]] and [[Moisei Ginzburg]].

==Legacy==
A number of Constructivists would teach or lecture at the [[Bauhaus]] schools in Germany, and some of the VKhUTEMAS teaching methods were adopted and developed there. Gabo established a version of Constructivism in England during the 1930s and 1940s that was adopted by architects, designers and artists after World War I (see [[Victor Pasmore]]), and [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]].  [[Joaquín Torres García]] and [[Manuel Rendón]] were instrumental in spreading Constructivism throughout Europe and Latin America.  Constructivism had an effect on the modern masters of Latin America such as: [[Carlos Mérida]], [[Enrique Tábara]], [[Aníbal Villacís]], [[Theo Constanté]], [[Oswaldo Viteri]],  [[Estuardo Maldonado]], [[Luis Molinari]], [[Carlos Catasse]], [[João Batista Vilanova Artigas]] and [[Oscar Niemeyer]], to name just a few. There have also been disciples in Australia, the painter [[George Johnson (artist)|George Johnson]] being the best known.

In the 1980s graphic designer [[Neville Brody]] used styles based on Constructivist posters that initiated a revival of popular interest. Also during the 1980s designer Ian Anderson founded [[The Designers Republic]], a successful and influential design company which used constructivist principles.

So-called [[Deconstructivism|Deconstructivist]] architecture was developed by architects [[Zaha Hadid]], [[Rem Koolhaas]] and others during the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Zaha Hadid by her sketches and drawings of abstract triangles and rectangles evokes the aesthetic of constructivism. Though similar formally, the socialist political connotations of Russian constructivism are deemphasized by Hadid's deconstructivism. Rem Koolhaas' projects revive another aspect of constructivism. The [[scaffold]] and [[Crane (machine)|crane]]-like structures represented by many constructivist architects are used for the finished forms of his designs and buildings.

'''Convenience Technologies''' enable viewers and users of [[television]], [[Internet]], [[mobile devices]], [[Digital Video Recorders]] (DVR), [[Video on Demand]] (VOD) and [[Digital Versatile Disc]] (DVD) to more easily seek out specific content and view it in individualized patterns. These technologies increase viewers’ ability to choose when they want to watch a program with the use of DVR, VOD and DVD, and where to watch a program with the use of [[DVD]], [[iPOD]], TiVo ToGo and mobile phones. These technological enhancers provide the most comprehensive and varied adjustments in the technological potential of the medium ([[Amanda D. Lotz]], 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;59).&lt;ref&gt;Lotz, Amanda D. "The Television Will Be Revolutionized." New York University Press. Retrieved April 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Convenience Technologies encourage active selection instead of generally watching what “comes on next” or “is on”. Because of this, consequently, viewers focused more on programs they wanted to watch than on the networks that supplied them (Lotz, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;59)

The main problem for networks is that the DVR using audience appears, by basically every measure that’s vital to advertisers, more wanted than the non-DVR crowds. According to a  Horizon Media Study, early adopters of technology are usually above the national average in income, in a “well-off” set. They are typically college graduates and white-collar workers (Lowry, 2010).&lt;ref&gt;Lowry, Brian. Variet, September 27-October 3, 2010, Vol. 420, Issue 7, p.&amp;nbsp;15-20, 2p.

The '''Crown of Immortality''' is a literary and religious [[metaphor]] traditionally represented in art first as a [[laurel wreath]] and later as a [[symbol]]ic [[circle of stars]] (often a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]], [[tiara]], [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] or [[aureola]]). The Crown appears in a number of [[Baroque]] [[Iconography|iconographic]] and  [[Allegory|allegoric]] works of art to indicate the wearer's [[immortality]].

==Wreath crowns==
[[File:Limestone head from a statue of a bearded worshipper from the sanctuary of Apollo at Idalion.jpg|thumb|upright|Wreathed worshipper of [[Apollo]], from [[Cyprus]], 475-450 BC]]
In [[ancient Egyptian religion|ancient Egypt]], the [[crown of justification]] was a wreath placed on the deceased to represent victory over death in the afterlife, in emulation of the resurrecting god [[Osiris]]. It was made of various materials including laurel, [[palm branch (symbol)|palm]], feathers, [[papyrus]], roses, or precious metals, with numerous examples represented on the [[Fayum mummy portraits]] of the [[Roman Egypt|Roman Imperial period]].&lt;ref&gt;Lorelei H. Corcoran and Marie Svoboda, ''Herakleides: A Portrait Mummy from Roman Egypt'' (Getty Publications, 2010), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient Greece, a [[Laurel wreath|wreath of laurel]] or olive was awarded to victorious athletes and later poets. Among the Romans, generals celebrating a formal [[Roman triumph|triumph]] wore a laurel wreath, an honor that during the [[Roman Empire|Empire]] was restricted to the Imperial family. The placing of the wreath was often called a "crowning", and its relation to immortality was problematic; it was supposed to secure the wearer immortality in the form of enduring fame, but the ''triumphator'' was also reminded of his place within the mortal world: in the traditional tableaux, an accompanying slave whispered continually in the general's ear ''[[Memento mori]]'', "Remember you are mortal".&lt;ref&gt;For a full discussion, see [[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], ''The Roman Triumph'' (Harvard University Press, 2007), ''passim'', limited preview [https://books.google.com/books?id=NwvKsHgd6cwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=intitle:triumph+inauthor:beard&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0#v=onepage&amp;q=slave&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Funerary wreaths of gold leaf were associated particularly with initiates into the [[mystery religions]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark J. Johnson, “Pagan-Christian Burial Practices of the Fourth Century: Shared Tombs?” ''Journal of Early Christian Studies'' 5 (1997), p. 45, citing [[Minucius Felix]], ''Octavius'' 28.3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Early Christian era the phrase "crown of immortality" was widely used by the [[Church Fathers]] in writing about [[martyr]]s; the immortality was now both of reputation on earth, and of eternal life in heaven. The usual visual [[Property|attribute]] of a martyr in art, was a [[Arecaceae|palm]] frond, not a wreath.{{cn|date=April 2013}} The phrase may have originated in scriptural references, or from incidents such as this reported by [[Eusebius]] (Bk V of History) describing the [[persecution in Lyon]] in 177, in which he refers to literal crowns, and also brings in an athletic metaphor of the "victor's crown" at the end:

[[File:Golden leaf crown of ancient macedonian origin, Thessaloniki, Greece.jpg|thumb|left|Gold wreath from [[ancient Macedonia]]]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;"From that time on, their martyrdoms embraced death in all its forms. From flowers of every shape and color they wove a crown to offer to the Father; and so it was fitting that the valiant champions should endure an ever-changing conflict, and having triumphed gloriously should win the mighty crown of immortality. Maturus, Sanctus, Blandina, and Attalus were taken into the amphitheater to face the wild beasts, and to furnish open proof of the inhumanity of the heathen, the day of fighting wild beasts being purposely arranged for our people. There, before the eyes of all, Maturus and Sanctus were again taken through the whole series of punishments, as if they had suffered nothing at all before, or rather as if they had already defeated their opponent in bout after bout and were now battling for the victor's crown."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swcp.com/~vogs/eusebius.html.  The metaphor of the "athlete of Christ" gaining the "Crown of Immortality" is developed further by St [[John Cassian]] in ''On Gluttony" Ch 18 &amp; 19 [http://chattablogs.com/hagioipateres/archives/020776.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050505094245/http://www.chattablogs.com/hagioipateres/archives/020776.html |date=2005-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first use seems to be that attributed to the martyr [[Ignatius of Antioch]] in 107.{{cn|date=April 2013}}

===Advent wreath===
[[Image:Sktlucia.jpg|thumb|200px|Candle-crowned Danish girls in a Lucia procession, 2001]]
An [[Advent wreath]] is a ring of candles, usually made with evergreen cuttings and used for household devotion by some Christians during the season of Advent. The wreath is meant to represent God's eternity.  On [[Saint Lucy's Day]], December 13, it is common to wear crowns of candles in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Italy, Bosnia, Iceland, and Croatia.

Before the reform of the [[Gregorian calendar]] in the 16th century, St. Lucy's Day fell on the [[winter solstice]]. The representation of Saint Lucy seems to derive from the [[List of Roman deities|Roman goddess]] [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]], who is connected to the solstice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=13th of December and related gods and goddesses|url=http://www.abctales.com/story/biggus/st-lucia-s-day-december-13th|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071210145753/http://www.abctales.com/story/biggus/st-lucia-s-day-december-13th|archivedate=2007-12-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Lucina|url=http://www.goddessmyths.com/Lucina-Ptesan-Wi.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crown of martyrdom==
[[Image:Christ Carrying the Cross 1580.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Jesus with [[Crown of Thorns]] by [[El Greco]], 1580]]
[[Martyr]]s often are idealized as [[combatants]], with the spectacle of the arena transposed to the martyr's struggle with [[Satan]]. [[Ignatius of Antioch]], condemned to fight beasts in the year 107, "asked his friends not to try to save him and so rob him of the crown of immortality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= About Martyrdom containing his words|url=http://www.cqpress.com/incontext/terrorism/links/epr_martyrdom.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 155, [[Polycarp]], Christian [[bishop]] of [[Smyrna]], was stabbed after a failed attempt to burn him at the stake. He is said to have been " … crowned with the wreath of immortality ... having through patience overcome the unjust governor, and thus acquired the crown of immortality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The words in Chapter 17, 19 of The Martyrdom of Polycarp|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0102.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius]] uses similar imagery to speak of [[Blandina]], martyred in the arena at [[Lyon]] in 177:

{{cquote|A small, weak, despised woman, who had put on Christ, the great invincible champion, and in bout after bout had defeated her adversary and through conflict had won the crown of immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The martyrdom of Blandina|url= http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/178604|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070308075639/http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/178604|archivedate= 2007-03-08|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emblem of [[Christian martyrs]], The Crown or wreath of Immortality, is a reward for those who stayed faithful until death. (1 Corinthians 9:24-27, James 1:12, and Revelation 2:10)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= About symbolism|url= http://www.churchmonumentssociety.org/newfile21.htm|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090808081158/http://www.churchmonumentssociety.org/newfile21.htm|archivedate= 2009-08-08|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crown of stars==
{{For|the iconographical motif represented above the head|circle of stars}}
The crown of stars, representing immortality, may derive from the story of [[Ariadne]], especially as told by [[Ovid]], in which the unhappy Ariadne is turned into a constellation of stars, the [[Corona Borealis]] (Crown of the North), modelled on a jewelled crown she wore, and thus becoming immortal.  In [[Titian]]'s ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]'' (1520–23, [[National Gallery, London]]), the constellation is shown above Ariadne's head as a circle of eight stars (though Ovid specifies nine), very similar to what would become the standard depiction of the [[motif (visual arts)|motif]].  Although the [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] was probably depicted in classical art, and is described in several literary sources, no classical visual depictions have survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://traumwerk.stanford.edu/philolog/2006/10/titians_bacchus_and_ariadne_15.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220052639/http://traumwerk.stanford.edu/philolog/2006/10/titians_bacchus_and_ariadne_15.html |archivedate=2015-02-20 |df= }} Paper by Patrick Hunt, Stanford U.&lt;/ref&gt; The Titian therefore appears to be the earliest such representation to survive, and it was also at this period that illustrations in [[Old master print|prints]] of the [[Apocalypse]] by artists such as [[Dürer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Albrecht Dürer's - Madonna on the Crecent|url= http://www.windsorfineart.com/artists/durer/Madonna-on-the-Crescent.html|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070102153655/http://www.windsorfineart.com/artists/durer/Madonna-on-the-Crescent.html|archivedate= 2007-01-02|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Apocalype artworks beginning with Albrecht Dürer's - Madonna Appears to St John (German)|url=http://www.payer.de/christentum/apokalypse.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean Duvet]] were receiving very wide circulation.

In ''Ariadne, Venus and Bacchus'', by Tintoretto (1576, [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]], Venice), a flying [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] crowns [[Ariadne]] with a circle of [[stars]], and many similar compositions exist, such as the ceiling of the [[Egyptian Hall]] at [[Boughton House]] of 1695.

==Allegorical development==
The first use of the crown of stars as an allegorical Crown of Immortality may be the ceiling [[fresco]], [[Allegory of Divine Providence and Barberini Power (Cortona)|Allegory of Divine Providence and Barberini Power]] (1633–39), in the [[Palazzo Barberini]] in Rome by [[Pietro da Cortona]].  Here a figure identified as Immortality is flying, with her crown of stars held out in front of her, near the centre of the large ceiling.  According to the earliest descriptions she is about to crown the Barberini emblems, representing [[Pope Urban VIII]], who was also a poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Palazzo Barberini fresco |url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/annenberg/asc/projects/comm544/library/images/158.html |access-date=2007-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314061600/http://www.usc.edu/schools/annenberg/asc/projects/comm544/library/images/158.html |archive-date=2007-03-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Palazzo Barberini fresco (simplified) |url=http://www.usc.edu/schools/annenberg/asc/projects/comm544/library/images/160.html |access-date=2007-02-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314061610/http://www.usc.edu/schools/annenberg/asc/projects/comm544/library/images/160.html |archive-date=2007-03-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Walter |last=Vitzthum |journal=[[Burlington Magazine]] |volume=103 |issue=703 |date=October 1961 |title=A Comment on the Iconography of Pietro da Cortona's Barberini Ceiling. |pages=426 |issn=0007-6287 |jstor=873383}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immortality seems to have been a preoccupation of Urban; his funeral monument by [[Bernini]] in [[St Peter's Basilica]] in Rome has Death as a life-size skeleton writing his name on a scroll. 

Two further examples of the Crown of Immortality can be found in Sweden, firstly in the great hall ceiling [[fresco]] of the [[Swedish House of Knights]] by [[David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl]] (between 1670–1675) which pictures among many [[allegory|allegoric]] figures Eterna ([[eternity]]) who holds in her hands the Crown of Immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Swedish article published by Swedish House of Knights naming the Crown. | url = http://riddarhuset.se/jsp/admin/archive/sbdocarchive/B12_Byggnadshistoria.pdf | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061231211338/http://www.riddarhuset.se/jsp/admin/archive/sbdocarchive/B12_Byggnadshistoria.pdf | archivedate = 2006-12-31 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The second is in [[Drottningholm Palace]], the home of the [[Swedish Royal Family]], in a ceiling fresco named ''The Great Deeds of The Swedish Kings'', painted in 1695 by [[David Klöcker Ehrenstrahl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Fresco at Drottningholm castle | url= http://members.xoom.alice.it/_XOOM/all42day/art/art4sep/23kloker/deedzb.html }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This has the same ''motif'' as the fresco in the House of Knights mentioned above.
The Drottningholm fresco, was shown in the 1000th stamp&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Stamp showing a crown of immortality |url=http://jsa.viewimage.net/images/web/Lists/Sweden/BlackPrints/2000-slania-1000th-stamp_blackprint-slania_133924_r_l.jpg |format=JPG}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Czesław Słania]], the [[Poles|Polish]] postage stamp and banknote engraver.

The crown was also painted by the [[France|French]] [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] painter [[Louis-Jean-François Lagrenée]], 1725–1805, in his ''Allegory on the Death of the Dauphin'', where the crown was held by a young son who had pre-deceased the father (alternative titles specifically mention the crown of Immortality).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.univ-montp3.fr/~pictura/GenerateurNotice.php?numnotice=A1632&amp;PHPSESSID=94ee9dbdb5e603b4592e6280530673e0 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070217180637/http://www.univ-montp3.fr/~pictura/GenerateurNotice.php?numnotice=A1632&amp;PHPSESSID=1e9c4de370f5635616a1a9ebd3169584 |date=2007-02-17 }} image and [[Diderot]]'s description&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dictation''' is the transcription of spoken text: one person who is "dictating" speaks and another who is "taking dictation" writes down the words as they are spoken. Among speakers of several languages, dictation is used as a test of [[language skill]], similar to [[spelling bee]]s in the English-speaking world. Secondary to teaching language skills, the exercise of dictation has also been used to introduce students to literary works, and to instill morals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldrich|first1=Leon W.|last2=Jones|first2=Olivia Mary|title=School Work|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W8EBAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA62|year=1904|publisher=Editors of School Work|pages=62–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The first known written use of the word was in 1581. It derives from Latin, ''dictare'' (to assert).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dictated?show=0&amp;t=1341690020|title=Dictaphone|publisher= Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2012-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method==

The exercise requires at least two persons: a reciter and a recorder. The reciter reads a selected text, evenly and clearly and at audible volume, by snippets of multiple words (three to ten or as need be). The text is transcribed by the recorders, as the reciter proceeds. Each snippet is read by the reciter at first slowly, then repeated once or twice at a normal pace. Once the selection has been read to the end in this way, the reciter reads the text once again from start to finish at a normal pace.  The recorders then have time to re-read their work, and edit where necessary. The exercise in [[Bloom's taxonomy#Cognitive|knowledge, comprehension and application]] comes to a close.

The [[Bloom's taxonomy|analysis and evaluation]] step now proceeds as follows, upon the revelation of the selected text. The process requires a red pen, and can be varied according to the maturity of the recorders, or as to taste:
* the reciter gathers the written work of the recorders and evaluates it;
* the recorders are given the selection and expected to grade themselves.
The latter auto-evaluation process is quicker, but is sometimes trickier for two reasons: one, the handwriting of the recorder is indistinguishable from that of the evaluator; and two, the severity of the evaluator may be in question as the same person (or class of persons) is employed.

The selected texts are often taken from a sentence, a paragraph or a page of a published book, and may include an homily in morals, honesty or nobility.  Biblical passages or pages from the [[La Fontaine's Fables|''Fables'' of La Fontaine]] have been employed with success throughout the ages.

==Dictation in different languages==

===French===

For speakers of [[French language|French]], ''la dictée'' is a school exercise that aims at testing the mastery of [[orthography]] and [[grammar]]. Since many features of [[French grammar]] are distinguished in writing but not in speech, this can be a challenging task.

Some ''dictées'' became famous for their difficulty or their interest, like those of [[Prosper Mérimée]] and [[Bernard Pivot]]. In several countries of the world (including [[Switzerland]], [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Poland]], and [[Canada]]), the dictations are the subject of structured championships, similar to English [[spelling bee]]s.

===Korean===

In [[South Korea]], ''badasseugi'' ([[Hangul]]: 받아쓰기) is a school exercise for children in the lower grades of [[Primary education|elementary school]]s. The [[Korean language]] is written using [[hangul]], which is basically a [[Phoneme|phonemic]] alphabet; however, Hangul writing is also [[morphophonemic]], so [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] knowledge (in addition to familiarity with hangul) is necessary for correct dictation. Also, [[Phonology|phonological]] rules such as [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]], and deletion can cause pronunciation to be different from what the written form may suggest. ''Badasseugi'' may take form of a word, a phrase, or a sentence, and is similar to spelling tests.

===Chinese===

Dictation in Chinese ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 听写 [[Pinyin]]: ''tīng xiě'', literally means 'listen and write') is a vital part of Chinese primary school education curriculum.  [[Chinese characters]] are unique because a single syllable can have different corresponding characters.  Since Chinese dictation is usually done in phrases (i.e. words are made up of more than one characters), this can help the person taking dictation to determine the proper character through phrases. Dictation also increases students' ability to write characters properly.

'''Direct Behavior Rating''' ('''DBR''') is a [[behavior]] [[Psychological assessment|assessment]] method that educational professionals, such as [[school psychologist]]s and [[teacher]]s, use to monitor student behavior. It is characterized by:
* Recording a rating immediately after a specified observation period
* Using a rater with firsthand experience with the rated individual for the duration of the observation period (e.g., a teacher in a classroom where one student is the target)
* Requiring "minimal inference" from the rater to discern relevant behaviors&lt;ref name="DBR Emerging Method"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chafouleas, S.M. |author2=Riley-Tillman, T.C. |author3=Christ, T.J. |year=2009 |title=Direct Behavior Rating (DBR): An emerging method for assessing social behavior within a tiered intervention system |journal=[[Assessment for Effective Intervention]]|volume=34 |pages=195–200 |doi=10.1177/1534508409340391}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, if a teacher was concerned about a student's disruptive behavior during [[math]] class and wanted to collect data on their behavior, they could explicitly define "disruptive behavior", observe the student's behavior during typical math instruction, and at the end of class, record for what percentage of time the student displayed disruptive behavior. This is an example of DBR using a Single Item Scale, or DBR-SIS.

Direct Behavior Rating typically involves four steps:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Chafouleas, S.M. |author2=Riley-Tillman, T.C. |author3=Sugai G. |year=2007 |title=School Based Behavior Assessment: Informing Instruction and Intervention |location=New York, NY |publisher=The Guilford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chafouleas |first=S.M. |author2=Riley-Tillman, T.C. |author3=McDougal, J.|year=2002|title=Good, bad, or in-between: How does the daily behavior report card rate? |journal=Psychology in the Schools |volume=39 |pages=157–169 |doi=10.1002/pits.10027}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Specify a target behavior to monitor
# Rate that behavior after a specific [[observation]] period
# Share the information with concerned individuals (e.g., [[parent]]s, teachers, [[student]]s)
# Use [[outcome data]] to monitor the target behavior over time 

Direct Behavior Rating represents an amalgamation of characteristics from two major types of behavior collection systems: systematic direct observation and behavior rating scales.&lt;ref name="DBR Emerging Method"/&gt; According to a [[Statistical survey|survey]] performed in 2006, over 60% of classroom teachers report that they employ DBR or DBR-like tools within their [[classroom]]s and view it as a highly acceptable intervention tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chafouleas, S.M. |author2=Riley-Tillman, T.C. |author3=Sassu, K.A. |year=2006 |title=Acceptability and reported use of Daily Behavior Report Cards among teachers |journal=Journal of Positive Behavior Interventions |volume=8 |pages=174–182 |doi=10.1177/10983007060080030601}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent [[research]] further indicates the acceptability of the measure to school psychologists who are frequently responsible for monitoring the effectiveness of research-based classroom interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Riley-Tillman, T.C. |author2=Chafouleas, S.M. |author3=Eckert, T. |year=2008 |title=Daily Behavior Report Cards and Systematic Direct Observation: An Investigation of the Acceptability, Reported Training and Use, and Decision Reliability among School Psychologists |journal= Journal of Behavioral Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DBR is not restricted to a single form of assessment. Rather, it is a methodology that can be used with a wide range of behaviors, contexts, and applications. One common distinction is made between DBR scales that consist of solely one item representing a behavioral construct (i.e., disruptive behavior) (Single Item Scales, or DBR-SIS) and those that consist of multiple items that are individually scored and then aggregated to depict a single construct (i.e., "Inappropriately calls out during instruction," "Pokes other students during instruction") (Multiple Item Scales, or DBR-MIS).&lt;ref name="DBR Foundation"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Christ, T.J. |author2=Riley-Tillman, T.C. |author3=Chafouleas, S.M. |year=2009 |title=Foundation for the development and use of Direct Behavior Rating (DBR) to assess and evaluate student behavior |journal=[[Assessment for Effective Intervention]]|volume=34 |pages=201–213 |doi=10.1177/1534508409340390}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of DBR research has focused on the Single Item Scale format, the content of which is intended to be flexibly determined based on the rating's context and then graphed and summarized independently of other Single Item Scales. While each DBR-SIS individually measures a single behavioral construct, the utility of using multiple Single Item Scales as general outcome measures for school-based social behavior has also been examined.&lt;ref name="DBR Foundation"/&gt;

Research has also investigated the feasibility of incorporating DBR into intervention packages. One study used DBR as a combined intervention and assessment tool through its use as a [[self-monitoring]] intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gureasko-Moore, S.P. |author2=DuPaul, G.J. |author3=White, G. |year=2007 |title=Self-management of classroom preparedness and homework: Effects on school functioning of adolescents with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder |journal=School Psychology Review |volume=36 |pages=647–664}}&lt;/ref&gt; Literature examining the use of daily behavior report cards or daily progress reports often use DBR methodology as an integral part of their intervention and assessment construction. More resources regarding behavior report cards are available at: 
* [http://www.interventioncentral.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=197 Behavior Report Card Generator] from [http://www.interventioncentral.org/ Intervention Central]
* [http://ccf.buffalo.edu/resources_downloads.php Daily Report Card resources] from the [http://ccf.buffalo.edu/ Center for Children and Families] at the [http://www.buffalo.edu/ University at Buffalo]

Given its promising [[psychometric]] properties, contextual relevance, and usability by practitioners with restricted resources (e.g., teachers), DBR has also been suggested as a possible assessment tool within multi-tiered intervention frameworks such as [[Response to Intervention]].&lt;ref name="DBR Emerging Method"/&gt;

'''Eduniversal''' is a university ranking business by the French [[Consultant|consulting]] company and [[rating agency]] ''SMBG'' specialized in [[Higher education|Higher Education]].&lt;ref&gt;Presentation of the Eduniversal Company on a TV program, ''Télématin'' on a French Channel, France 2 - 26th of June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1994, one of the main goals of Eduniversal is to provide a tool, for students all around the world, which provides information on the Best [[Business school|Business Schools]], located in Eduniversal's 9 geographical regions (the 5 continents).

The Eduniversal ranking agency establishes an official selection of the Best 1000 Business Schools in more than 150 countries in the world. The purpose of this  selection is to offer students a serious [[referent]] that reflects the international dimension of each School, and therefore enables them to make the right decision regarding the choice of their future School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20080510110455694 FRANCE: Global list of business schools published]&lt;/ref&gt;

The official selection is the result of the work of an International Scientific Committee gathered at the initiative of the Eduniversal Company. The International Scientific Committee is composed of 12 members; 9 members coming from nine different geographic zones ([[Africa]], [[Central Asia]], [[Eastern Europe]], [[Eurasia]] and [[Middle East]], [[Far East Asia]], [[Latin America]], [[North America]], [[Oceania]] and [[Western Europe]]), and 2 members from the Eduniversal Company (The CEO and the International Coordinator).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trncinfo.com/TANITMADAIRESI/ARSIV2008/ENGLISHarcive/JANUARY/310108.htm, ''Gau and Emu selected amongst 1000 Business Schools of the world ''published on the 31 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
The '''official selection'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universityworldnews.com/index.php?page=Top_1000_BusSchools_2009, ''2009 : The World's Top 1000 Business Schools'', paragraph 6.&lt;/ref&gt; as it is defined by the Eduniversal Company is the classification of the 1000 best Business Schools in 153 countries in the World. The selection is classified in terms of '''Palms''' and '''Ratings''', issued from the Deans' votes.
The aim of this official selection is to provide sufficient information for [[student]]s about a range of [[academic institution]]s, sorted by their reputations and international ambitions and located in 9 different zones.

===Official Selection===

The Official Selection is a selection of Business Schools made by a Scientific Committee that has established a global mapping system meeting the criteria of universality and the international reputation of each academic institution.

Eduniversal offers to describe the best academic opportunities for students zone by zone, via a range of schools with different types of [[reputation]] and international ambitions, within the nine zones list.

According to the Eduniversal company, the international reputation is the capacity of a Business School to increase the prestige of a student – and therefore improve his [[employment]] prospects – in his country of study and on the international stage.

In order to execute the official selection, each country and each continent is represented according to a quota method. The number of schools per country is therefore weighted by quantitative and qualitative criteria.

'''Quantitative criteria'''
* the national [[expenditure]] on [[education]] per inhabitant
* the [[Gross domestic product|GDP]]
* the size of the population
* the number of students in higher education

'''Qualitative criterion'''

the educational environment in the country (established, among other things, according to the number of [[secondary education]] academic institutions in the country, as well as a historical importance of the national educational tradition).
The results can therefore be expressed in the following way:

{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! '''Country''' !! '''National Expenditure on Education per inhabitant''' !! '''GDP per inhabitant''' !! '''Population size in Millions''' !! No. of students in Higher Education !! '''Qualitative Criterion''' !! '''Schools Quota Results'''
|-
| Tunisia || $605.10 || $8,898 || 9,815,644 || 26,435 || - || 4 Schools
|-
| Poland || $773.80 || $14,880 || 38,625,478 || 447,785 || - || 12 Schools
|-
| Indonesia || $64.80 || $4,323 || 245,452,739 || 552,660 || - || 7 Schools
|-
| Mexico || $495 || $11,249 || 107,449,525 || 339,450 || - || 17 Schools
|-
| Netherlands || $1,683.70 || $35,078 || 16,318,199 || 89,341 || - || 13 Schools
|}

The official selection is made by the International Scientific Committee composed of 9 members coming from the nine geographic zones listed above.

The 9 expert members are all well-known academics in their respective zone.

The International Scientific Committee&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universityworldnews.com/index.php?page=Top_1000_BusSchools_2009, International Selection Committee - last chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; meets:
* to modify the Official Selection, two years after the first Selection, then every four years, depending on changes and global trends.
* yearly, to publish the Palmes arising from international criteria and the votes of the Deans on the website: www.eduniversal.net.

===Palmes===
The EDUNIVERSAL Palmes indicate the level of an academic institution's international reputation. They are awarded on the basis of the [[research]] work carried out by the International Scientific Committee, which compiles the list of criteria, together with the assessments made by peers: '''The Deans vote'''

They help the student to make his choice within the Official Selection and rate the reputation of the [[school]] or [[university]] within the country, its geographical zone, or even at the global level.

The Palmes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.universityworldnews.com/index.php?page=Top_1000_BusSchools_2009, Chapter : Identifying the Best Business Schools, ''Awarding the Palmes''&lt;/ref&gt; are divided into a league system, which allows horizontal intercontinental comparison, different from the vertical comparison made by most of the international classification systems.

This segmentation is presented as a normal probability curve:
* 100 schools in the 5 Palmes league
* 200 schools in the 4 Palmes league
* 400 schools in the 3 Palmes league
* 200 schools in the 2 Palmes league
* 100 schools in the 1 Palme league

The classification by Palmes is made using two essential elements: the '''internationalisation criteria''' and the '''Deans vote'''.

'''Internalisation criteria'''

'''Environmental social science''' is the broad, [[transdisciplinary]] study of interrelations between humans and the natural environment. Environmental social scientists work within and between the fields of [[anthropology]], [[communication studies]], [[economics]], [[geography]], [[history]], [[political science]], [[psychology]], and [[sociology]]; and also in the [[interdisciplinary]] fields of [[environmental studies]], [[human ecology]] and [[political ecology]], [[social epidemiology]], among others.

== Ideologies, fields and concepts ==

Ideologies, fields and concepts in environmental social science aim to convey environmental issues as intertwined in societal relations, institutions and human activities that continually shape the environment or are themselves shaped by the environment. For example, political ecology is based on the premise that the environment is not "A-political" therefore the way it is managed, who has access to the environment, how environmental resources are distributed are shaped through political structures, power relations, economic institutions and social processes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Paul Robbins, conveys this in his differentiation of "A-political verse political ecologies". According to Robbins political ecology places emphasis on identifying "broader systems rather than blaming proximate and local forces; between viewing ecological systems as power-laden rather than politically inert; and between taking an explicitly normative approach rather than one that claims the objectivity of disinterest".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Ecology: A critical introduction|last=Robbins|first=Paul|publisher=Wiley Blackbell|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=13 - 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human environmental relations reverberate through "the system" &amp;nbsp;(politics, economics, power relations) moving through an entire web of human relations and structures that are intertwined in ecological relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Ecology: A critical Introduction|last=Robbins|first=Paul|publisher=Wiley Blackbell|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, environmental social scientists stress human – environmental relationships. Another idea that has risen to prominence in environmental social science in light of this, is the idea of "environmental justice" which connects issues in the field of social justice with issues related to the environment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culture and Conservation: Beyond Anthropocentrism|last=Shoreman-Ouimet|last2=Kopnina|first=Eleanor and Helen|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=|location=London, New York|pages=120 - 147}}&lt;/ref&gt; In describing environmental justice, the concepts emphasized by Shoreman-Ouimet and Kopnina include "equity equality, and rights issues in relation to both social and ecological actors".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Culture and Conservation: Beyond Anthropocentrism|last=Shoreman-Ouimet|last2=Kopnina|first=Eleanor and Helen|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=|location=London, Newyork|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pans out in debates about environmental vulnerability and the unequal distribution of resources. Here lies the idea, that certain groups are made more vulnerable to "environmental burdens"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; while others gain more access to "environmental benefits"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; as defined in terms of environmental resources and services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In further attempting to understand human - environmental relationships disciplines of environmental social science have begun to explore relationships between humans and non-humans, to understand how both interact with each other within the natural world. Ideas related to exploring human and animal interactions within the natural world, have become prominent in environmental ethics. Shoreman Ouimet and Kopnina define environment ethics as "a sub-discipline of philosophy that deals with the ethical problems surrounding the environment, in some cases providing ethical justification and moral motivation for the cause of environmental protection or for considerations of animal welfare".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This has culminated in debates regarding environmental value and moral rights and who within the larger ecosystem should be assigned these rights.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Environmental ethics explores the dialectic between human and nature exploring how the human configuration of nature may in turn reshape humans, their relationships and their conditions. Ideas that have emerged from the questions seeking to examine this dialectic include those of "post-domesticity and domesticity".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Political Ecology of Meat|last=Emel|last2=Neo|first=Jodey &amp; Harvey|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=London, New York|pages=5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domesticity refers to societal dynamics produced in societies in which humans have daily contact with animals other than pets in contrast in post-domesticity people are quite distant from the animals they consume in referencing the ideas of Bulliet (2005) Emel and Neo convey that a distance from witnessing the processes that govern animal life including births, deaths while consuming animals as food, impacts people differently than if they were to be interacting continuously with animals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They mention that post- domesticity may produce feelings of guilt however the continued distance between animal life brought by interacting with animals as a commodity may cause people to only distantly relate to them or think of them as packages in a store disassociating them from the life-cycles they embody.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Therefore environmental science has paved the way to multiple concepts, ideas and paradigms that differ among each other but all seek to intertwine issues related to the environment with other fields and issues in the social sciences.

== Social epidemiology ==
Social epidemiologists research how SES (socio-economic status) determines varying access to resources like income and prestige can generate stratification in health and quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ReTRAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=snippet&amp;q=social%20epidemiologist&amp;f=false|title=Social Epidemiology|last=Berkman|first=Lisa F.|last2=Kawachi|first2=Ichirō|last3=Glymour|first3=M. Maria|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195377903|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, their investigations relate to the social determinants of health which the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) reports as the "conditions in the places where people live, learn, work, and play ... that affect a wide range of health risks and outcomes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/socialdeterminants/|title=Social Determinants of Health {{!}} CDC|date=2017-07-28|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These epidemiologists must work in conjunction with environmental social scientists to understand the significance of different environments' effects on humans. Such work influences environmental and public health policies to better the living standards for humans globally. The Fifth European [[Ministerial Conference]] on Environment and Health agreed to work on improving low-income housing conditions with new [[urban planning]], [[health equity]], and environmental justice policies with a specific focus on preventing children from exposure to significant environmental health risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hia/housing/en/|title=WHO {{!}} Housing and Health|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain environments' affects on humans provides trends that social epidemiologists can investigate to determine if they are related to a divide of social status especially if only a certain part of the population is negatively affected. [[Epidemiology]] uses a host-agent-environment triangle framework to understand why humans are falling ill and this three prong approach allows social epidemiologists to explore how the environment is contributing to the decline in health status for a subsection of or the entire population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gulis|first=Gabriel|last2=Fujino|first2=Yoshihisa|date=2015-03-05|title=Epidemiology, Population Health, and Health Impact Assessment|journal=Journal of Epidemiology|volume=25|issue=3|pages=179–180|doi=10.2188/jea.JE20140212|issn=0917-5040|pmc=4340993|pmid=25716580}}&lt;/ref&gt; It promotes the idea that the social, cultural, economic, political and environmental factors are all important factors to be considered, and health impact assessments (HIA) recommended by social epidemiologists working with environment social scientists are effectively making positive changes in the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gulis|first=Gabriel|last2=Fujino|first2=Yoshihisa|date=2015-03-05|title=Epidemiology, Population Health, and Health Impact Assessment|journal=Journal of Epidemiology|volume=25|issue=3|pages=179–180|doi=10.2188/jea.JE20140212|issn=0917-5040|pmc=4340993|pmid=25716580}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) worked with its members to compose the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) protocol in 2001 to ensure health impact assessments would be made with environmental assessments for policies relating to bettering the quality of life especially within low socioeconomic communities all around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.who.int/hia/network/who_role/en/index2.html|title=WHO {{!}} WHO activities in HIA|website=www.who.int|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the environment can create stressors that are factors (i.e. low quality housing in areas of high pollution) that limit the quality of life of millions of people globally, environmental social scientists work collaboratively with the data social epidemiologists investigate and provide to understand the relationship between health status and environmental issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ReTRAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=environment&amp;f=false|title=Social Epidemiology|last=Berkman|first=Lisa F.|last2=Kawachi|first2=Ichirō|last3=Glymour|first3=M.

The '''Euphronios Krater''' (or '''Sarpedon krater''') is an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[terra cotta]] calyx-[[krater]], a bowl used for [[Ancient Greece and wine|mixing wine with water]]. Created around the year 515 BC, it is the only complete example of the surviving 27 vases painted by the renowned [[Euphronios]] and is considered one of the finest Greek vase [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] in existence. Part of the [[Collection (museum)|collection]] of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] from 1972 to 2008, the vase was [[Repatriation (cultural heritage)|repatriated]] to [[Italy]] under an agreement negotiated in February 2006, and is now in the collection of the Archaeological Museum of Cerveteri as part of a strategy of returning works of art to their place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Stokstad, Marilyn and Michael W. Cothren. ''Art History''. Fourth Edition, vol. 1. Pearson Prentice Hall, 2011. p119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2015/11/07/news/franceschini_il_cratere_di_eufronio_resta_a_cerveteri_-126844061/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The Euphronios krater stands 45.7&amp;nbsp;cm (18 inches) in height and has a [[diameter]] of 55.1&amp;nbsp;cm (21.7 inches). It can hold about 45 L (12 gallons). The style of the vase is [[red-figure pottery]], in which figure outlines, details, and the background are painted with an opaque black slip while the figures themselves are left in the color of the unpainted terracotta ceramic clay. 
 
The krater is decorated with two scenes.&lt;ref name="SchefoldGiuliani1992"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karl Schefold|author2=Luca Giuliani|title=Gods and Heroes in Late Archaic Greek Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2DA_Aze7F0C&amp;pg=PA250|date=3 December 1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-32718-3|pages=250–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An episode from the [[Trojan War]] is shown on the [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]]; this illustration depicts the death of [[Sarpedon]], son of [[Zeus]] and [[Laodamia]]. The [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the krater shows a contemporary scene of [[Athens|Athenian]] youths from the sixth century BC arming themselves before battle. In the scene of Sarpedon's death, the god [[Hermes]] directs the [[personification]]s of Sleep ([[Hypnos]]) and Death ([[Thanatos]]) to carry the fallen away to his homeland for burial. While the subject of Sarpedon's death might normally be depicted as a stylized tableau, the figures in this scene are painted in naturalistic poses and with schematic, but accurate anatomy. This style is emblematic of the [[Pioneer Group]] of [[Archaic period in Greece|late Archaic]] painters, of whom Euphronios is considered the most accomplished. The scene of the anonymous Greek youths on the reverse shares this naturalistic style, using all the Pioneer Group's characteristic techniques of anatomical accuracy, natural poses, foreshortening, and spatial illusion.

Also characteristic of the Pioneer Group is the narrative tension created both by pairing these two scenes on the same piece, and by painting them in a common style. The death of Sarpedon, a quasi-mythological story which would be familiar to anyone viewing the krater, is an episode involving specific historical and mythological figures. The other scene, of the anonymous youths preparing for war, is both more general and explicitly contemporary. The young men are not heroes of legend; with their finely detailed features, they are given personality and character, but they could be any of the youthful soldiers in the Greek army. Both scenes are painted with similar styles, making the historical scene appear more contemporary; likewise, the contemporary scene begins to share some of the other's mythological qualities. The two scenes invite comparison between the narratives they depict; certainly, the hero Sarpedon was no less youthful than these anonymous boys, and Death and Sleep may well come for them as they did for him.

The vase is signed both by Euxitheos as [[Pottery|potter]] and [[Euphronios]] as [[Painting|painter]]. While it was customary for the painter to sign the finished work, it was less common for the potter to add his own name. The presence of both signatures indicates that Euxitheos felt the vase to be one of his finest works. Besides the artists' signatures on the obverse side, it also carries the inscription "Leagros is handsome." on the reverse. This inscription has allowed art historians to date the krater to approximately 520-510 BC, because at this time Leagros was considered the handsomest man in Greece. All names are written in [[Attic Greek|Attic letters]].

==History==
Records in Italian courts of an investigation indicate that the krater was [[Looted art|looted]] from an [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] [[tomb]] in the Greppe Sant'Angelo near [[Cerveteri]] in December 1971. The krater was sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art by [[Robert E. Hecht]], an American [[antiquities]] dealer living in Rome, for [[United States dollar|US$]]1.2 million on November 10, 1972.&lt;ref name="LLC1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=New York Media, LLC|title=New York Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HeYCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA68|date=7 December 1981|publisher=New York Media, LLC|pages=68–|issn=0028-7369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hecht, who was accused of trafficking in [[illicit antiquities]], claimed to have acquired the krater from Dikran Sarrafian, a [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] dealer, whose family had been in possession of the piece since 1920. Evidence suggests that Hecht may have purchased the krater in 1972 from [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]], an Italian dealer who was convicted of selling stolen art in 2005.&lt;ref name="WatsonTodeschini2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Watson|author2=Cecilia Todeschini|title=The Medici Conspiracy: The Illicit Journey of Looted Antiquities from Italy's Tomb Raiders to the World's Greatest Museums|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5uN8rvqaKYC&amp;pg=PA201|year=2007|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-58648-438-5|pages=201–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hecht denied the charges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/19/arts/design/19bowl.html?ref=world Euphronios Krater Returned - Art - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Hoving]], director of the Met and the primary negotiator in the purchase, later said in his memoirs, ''Making the Mummies Dance'', "An intact red-figured Greek vase of the early sixth century B.C. could only have been found in Etruscan territory in Italy, by illegal excavators".&lt;ref name="Hoving1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Thomas Hoving|title=Making the Mummies Dance: Inside The Metropolitan Museum Of Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dItWAJxHT2MC|date=15 February 1994|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-671-88075-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; To allay concerns, some six months after the krater was bought he prompted the Metropolitan Museum to send a private detective to Zurich in an endeavor to reinforce the cited Sarrafian provenance.&lt;ref name="HufnagelChappell2014"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dr Saskia Hufnagel|author2=Professor Duncan Chappell|title=Contemporary Perspectives on the Detection, Investigation and Prosecution of Art Crime: Australasian, European and North American Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lXg3BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|date=28 October 2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-1-4094-6313-9|pages=18–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, following the trial of [[Giacomo Medici (art dealer)|Giacomo Medici]] and related disclosures about antiquities smuggling, the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Italian government signed an agreement under which ownership of the Euphronios krater and several other pieces of art was [[Art repatriation|returned]] to Italy in exchange for long-term loans of other comparable objects owned by Italy.  The krater remained on display at the Metropolitan Museum until January 2008, when it returned to Italy. It was unveiled in [[Rome]] on 18 January.&lt;ref&gt;Povoledo, Elisabetta, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/19/arts/design/19bowl.html Ancient Vase Comes Home to a Hero’s Welcome]. New York Times (19 January 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; The krater was displayed at the  Villa Giulia [[National Etruscan Museum]] in Rome from 2008-2014 until it was moved as part of a temporary display in the Cerveteri Museum celebrating the UNESCO World Heritage Site affiliation for the necropolis at Banditaccia.  Following the increase of attendance at the museum, the Cultural Heritage Minister, Dario Franceschini, has announced that the krater will remain at the Archaeological Museum of Cerveteri as part of a strategy of returning works of art to their place of origin.&lt;ref&gt;http://roma.repubblica.it/cronaca/2015/11/07/news/franceschini_il_cratere_di_eufronio_resta_a_cerveteri_-126844061/&lt;/ref&gt;

Details from the krater's obverse have been used as a book cover illustration.  The [[Penguin Classics]] deluxe edition of [[Robert Fagles|Robert Fagles']] English translation of the [[Iliad]] employs a close-up of Thanatos for its front cover, and a close-up of Sarpedon for its back cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Homer |translator-last=Fagles |translator-first=Robert |editor1-last=Knox |editor1-first=Bernard |title=The Iliad |publisher=Penguin |date=1998 |edition=Penguin Classics Deluxe |isbn=9780140275360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Faddan More Psalter cover.jpg|thumb|The cover of the psalter, after conservation]]
The '''Faddan More Psalter''' ({{lang-ga|Saltair an Fheadáin Mhóir}}) (also '''Irish Bog Psalter''' or "Faddan Mor Psalter") is an [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] Christian [[psalter]] or text of the [[book of Psalms]], discovered in a [[peat bog]] in July 2006, in the townland of [[Faddan More]] ({{lang-ga|Feadán Mór}}) in north [[County Tipperary]], Ireland.&lt;ref name=IOL&gt;[http://breakingnews.iol.ie/news/story.asp?j=191201038&amp;p=y9yzxy744&amp;n=191201798 Location of 'Ireland's Dead Sea Scrolls' revealed]- IOL news 05/08/2006 – 09:50:08&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript was probably written in about 800 in one of a number of monasteries in the area.  A unique feature is that the inside of the leather cover is lined with [[papyrus]], probably as a stiffening, an indication of the links between the Irish and [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic church]]es at the time.  After several years of conservation work, the psalter went on display at the [[National Museum of Ireland]] in Kildare St, Dublin in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;NMI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cunningham|first=Grainne|title=Public gets first look at ancient book of psalms|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/public-gets-first-look-at-ancient-book-of-psalms-2668780.html|accessdate=9 June 2011|newspaper=The Irish Independent|date=8 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This discovery was hailed by the National Museum of Ireland as one of the most significant Irish [[archaeology|archaeological]] finds in decades.&lt;ref name=RTE&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0725/manuscript.html Ancient manuscript discovered in the Midlands] – RTÉ News&lt;/ref&gt; Bernard Meehan of the [[Trinity College Library]], who was called in to advise on the discovery, said that he believed the psalter was the first discovery of an Irish early [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[manuscript]] in two centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Meehan cited in the [http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/psalms-emerge-from-irish-bog/2006/07/26/1153816254848.html Sydney Morning Herald]&lt;/ref&gt; During the conservation process, in the period 2006–2010, the lining of the binding was found to have elements of [[papyrus]], adding further evidence to the known links between Irish [[Celtic Christianity]] and the Egyptian [[Coptic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/national-news/manuscript-dug-from-bog-rates-among-our-top-10-biggest-finds-2325341.html ''Manuscript dug from bog rates among our top 10 biggest finds'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The psalter joins the very small number of very early Western books that have survived fully intact with their original [[bookbinding]]s.  These mostly have their origins in the monastic [[Insular art]] of Britain and Ireland, and the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Celtic]] and [[Anglo-Saxon mission|Anglo-Saxon]] missions to Europe.  The earliest is the [[St Cuthbert Gospel]] of about 700 ([[British Library]]), and other examples probably of the mid-8th century are at [[Fulda]] on the continent. However the wallet-like style of the Faddan More binding, and the fact that it does not seem to have been physically attached to the sewn-together pages, make it unique among surviving covers.

==Description==
The psalter contains the Latin text of the Psalms, complete on 60 sheets of [[vellum]] in five gatherings or [[Paper quire|quire]]s. The text is a [[Latin_Psalters#Versio_Gallicana|Gallican]] version of the [[Vulgate]], written in [[Insular majuscule]] letters in a single column.  The first letter of each psalm has a capital and, as is often the case, the opening words of psalms 1, 51 and 101 are decorated, using black, red, and yellow.&lt;ref&gt;NMI&lt;/ref&gt;

The original leather binding has a fold-over flap with three horn buttons that were probably used to secure a thong or straps, now missing, that tied the cover up; it does not seem to have been physically attached to the gathered and sewn-together pages inside, forming what we might call today a folder or wallet.  Similar covers seem to be shown in some images in manuscripts, but no comparable covers have survived.  The outside of the cover was "painted with black carbon-based pigment".&lt;ref&gt;NMI PDF&lt;/ref&gt; The leather seems to have been used as a trial piece or sketchpad for composing patterns of [[interlace (art)|interlace]] for other objects. On the inside there is a sheet of papyrus, presumably used as a liner to stiffen the cover somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;NMI, and NMI PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

Low oxygen levels in the bog provide unusual preservation conditions, and bogs were often used by Irish monks as hiding places for valuables in the face of [[Viking]] raids. In addition to low oxygen levels, [[sphagnum]] moss, of which the peat bog is composed, produces an antibiotic substance called [[sphagnan]] that binds with proteins on the surface of microorganisms, immobilising them. Its highly reactive carbonyl groups can alter chemicals and nutrients that would otherwise decompose organic matter. And above all the sphagnum moss causes organic material to undergo chemical changes itself that make it impervious to rot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2146638/ How do bogs keep things fresh?] by Daniel Engber, Slate, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
It was uncovered by bulldozer driver Eddie Fogarty,&lt;ref name=IOL/&gt; a worker extracting [[peat]] with a [[backhoe]]. Dr. Patrick Wallace, director of the National Museum, praised Fogarty for immediately having covered the book with damp soil, as exposure to dry air after so many centuries of dampness might have destroyed it.  The book was initially stored in refrigeration at the National Museum. Identifying the safest way to pry open the pages without damaging or destroying them was expected to take months, and conservation work to take two years.  The area around Faddan More Bog is rich in medieval history. Monastic foundations such as [[Lorrha]] and [[Terryglass]] in County Tipperary and [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]] and Seirkieran in County Offaly are located nearby.&lt;ref name=IOL/&gt;

The bog is owned by local brothers Kevin and Patrick Leonard. Six years before the psalter find, a leather satchel was found that, by [[radiocarbon dating]], was estimated to originate from between the seventh and ninth centuries. This was located just 100m from the psalter findspot and is of a similar date suggesting that the satchel may have originally contained the book.  Additionally, in the years prior to 2006, two ancient wooden vessels were also found in the same bog.&lt;ref name=IOL/&gt;

==Misreported prophecy==
When found, the book was opened to a page displaying [[Psalms|Psalm]] [[s:la:The Old Testament (Vulgate)/Psalmi#83|83]] (in the [[Septuagint]] numbering), which corresponds with [[s:en:Bible (King James)/Psalms#84|Psalm 84]] in the [[Masoretic Text|Masoretic]] numbering used in most English-language translations.&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5584495 Ancient Psalms Found Preserved in Irish Bog] – NPR&lt;/ref&gt; Due to confusion regarding differences in numbering the Psalms, some news sites implied that the Psalter was open at the [[s:en:Bible (King James)/Psalms#83|Masoretic Psalm 83]]. That psalm contains such lines as "They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance"; this reference to the attempted destruction of [[Israel]] connected the find in some people's minds with the contemporaneous [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]]. The matter was clarified by the director of the [[National Museum of Ireland]], who pointed out the difference in [[Septuagint]] vs. [[Masoretic]] numbering and that the displayed psalm contains no reference to the destruction of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/front/2006/0728/1153813832813.html Museum plays diplomatic role on psalm's 'warning to Israel' – Irish Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
The National Museum of Ireland consulted with specialists in archaeological conservation and book conservation about the best way to conserve the psalter, and received partly conflicting advice. Ultimately a multi-phase conservation plan was determined. The first phase involved non-destructive examination of the psalter in the form in which it was discovered – e.g., photography, MRI scanning, and examination of the binding by book-binding specialists. In the second phase, experiments were done on 18th century parchments to determine the best way of drying waterlogged parchment. The most effective method involved soaking the parchment in ethanol to replace the water, placing it between blotting sheets, and vacuum-packing it. In the third phase, this technique was tested on small fragments of the psalter, and found to be effective. Conservators then began applying this method to larger sections of the psalter, and found they could consistently achieve shrinkage of only 2–5%, against 75% on a small fragment that was air-dried.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.ie/GetAttachment.aspx?id=432d9d81-909c-4921-a86c-0992c01b4194 The Faddan More Psalter: a progress update] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615153450/http://www.museum.ie/GetAttachment.aspx?id=432d9d81-909c-4921-a86c-0992c01b4194 |date=15 June 2011 }}, by John Gillis and Anthony Read

'''Immunodermatology''' studies [[skin]] as an organ of [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] in health and disease. Several areas have special attention, such as photo-immunology (effects of [[Ultraviolet|UV]] light on skin defense), [[inflammation|inflammatory]] diseases such as [[Hidradenitis suppurativa]], [[allergy|allergic]] contact [[dermatitis]] and [[atopic eczema]], presumably [[autoimmune]] skin diseases such as [[vitiligo]] and [[psoriasis]], and finally the [[immunology]] of [[microbial]] skin diseases such as [[retrovirus]] infections and [[leprosy]]. New therapies in development for the [[Immunosuppressant|immunomodulation]] of common immunological skin diseases include [[Biomolecule|biologicals]] aimed at neutralizing [[Tumor necrosis factor-alpha|TNF-alfa]] and [[chemokine receptor]] inhibitors.

'''Inconnu Art Group''' (later the '''Inconnu Independent Art Group''') is the name of a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] group of maverick [[fine art]]ists from the [[communism|communist]] and postcommunist eras. The original members were Bokros Péter, Molnár Tamás, Csécsei Mihály, Mészáros Bánk, Letenyei József, Sipos Mihály, Kopács Kovács Miklós, and Morva Ibolya. The foundation date of the group is unknown, but as Péter Bokros remembers (in 2005), they started their common activities in 1978, [[Cegléd]], but the name "inconnu" came later.

They  took part in (often illegal) exhibitions and performances in the eighties; and were considered as an important part of the Hungarian democratic opposition both in Hungary and in abroad. From 1979 they were subject to serious manhunt by the Hungarian authorities, and they were continuously followed and eyed by secret agents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galantai.hu/festo/1982/820614.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Post-Communism==
After 1994 some members became active again and continued &amp;ndash; in their words &amp;ndash; their "[[anticommunism|anti-communist]]" drive, now against the (post-communist socialist) governments (led by Hungarian Socialist Party, MSzP).{{fact|date=January 2014}} Other members created independent art and to explore the "rubberized horror of global powers".{{fact|date=January 2014}}

[[Image:ILL Grenoble soleil.jpg|thumb|right|Institut Laue-Langevin]]
[[File:ILL members map.svg|thumb|right|ILL members]]
The '''Institut Laue–Langevin''' ('''ILL''') is an internationally financed scientific facility, situated on the [[Polygone Scientifique]] in [[Grenoble]], [[France]]. It is one of the world centres for research using [[neutron]]s. Founded in 1967 and honouring the [[physicist]]s [[Max von Laue]] and [[Paul Langevin]], the ILL provides one of the most intense neutron sources in the world and the most intense continuous neutron flux in the world in the moderator region: 1.5×10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; neutrons per second per cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, with a thermal power of 58.3&amp;nbsp;MW. 

The ILL neutron scattering facilities provide an indispensable analytical tool for the analysis of the structure of novel conducting and magnetic materials for future electronic devices, the measurement of stresses in mechanical materials, and investigations into how complex molecular assemblies behave, particularly in a biological environment. The ILL also tackles questions relating to the fundamental properties of matter.

== History ==
[[Image:Institut Laue Langevin inside reactor hall.jpg|thumb|right|Inside the reactor hall]]
The institute was founded by [[France]] and [[Germany]], with the [[United Kingdom]] becoming the third major partner in 1973. These partner states provide, through [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]], the bulk of its funding. Ten other countries have since become partners. Scientists of institutions in the member states may apply to use the ILL facilities, and may invite scientists from other countries to participate. Experimental time is allocated by a scientific council involving ILL users. The use of the facility and travel costs for researchers are paid for by the institute. Commercial use, for which a fee is charged, is not subject to the scientific council review process. Over 750 experiments are completed every year, in fields including [[magnetism]], [[superconductivity]], [[materials engineering]], and the study of [[liquid]]s, [[colloid]]s and biological substances. 

The high-flux [[research reactor]] produces neutrons through fission in a specially designed, compact-core fuel element.  [[Neutron moderators]] cool the neutrons to useful wavelengths, which are then directed at a suite of instruments and used to probe the structure and behaviour of many forms of matter by elastic and inelastic [[neutron scattering]], and to probe the fundamental physical properties of the [[neutron]].  Nothing goes to waste: [[Fission products]] and [[gamma rays]] produced by nuclear reactions in the reactor core are also used by specialised instruments, which forms an important part of the instrument suite.

An ambitious modernisation programme was launched in 2000, through the design of new neutron infrastructure and the introduction of new instruments and instrument upgrades. The first phase has already resulted in 17-fold gains in performance. The second phase has started in 2008, it comprises the building of 5 new instruments, the upgrade of 4 others, and the installation of 3 new neutron guides.

== EPN Science Campus ==
{{Science with neutrons}}
The ILL shares its site, the 'epn science campus',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epn-campus.eu/ epn-campus.eu]&lt;/ref&gt; with other institutions including the [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] (ESRF) and the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBL) and the [[Unit for Viral Host Cell Interactions]] (UVHCI). The French Institut de Biologie Structurale (IBS) has joined the campus in 2013.

== Members ==
The ILL is governed by its Associates, the founding countries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An international partnership for science|url=http://www.ill.eu/about/what-is-the-ill/an-international-partnership/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications research ==
In summer 2016, using an imaging technique neutron radiation, the facilities of the Institut Laue–Langevin demonstrate that a molecule called ectoine is used by [[Halomonas titanicae]] near the wreck of [[RMS Titanic]] to survive the osmotic pressure that salt water causes on their membranes. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laboratoryequipment.com/news/2016/09/extremophile-bacteria-will-eat-away-wreck-titanic-2030 laboratoryequipment.com, September 6, 2016, Extremophile Bacteria’ Will Eat Away Wreck of the Titanic by 2030.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and recognitions ==
The physicist [[Duncan Haldane]] who worked at the institute from 1977 to 1981 received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2016 with [[Michael Kosterlitz]] and [[David J. Thouless]] for their work on the transitions of topological phases in the material.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/science/nobel-prize-physics-topology.html nytimes October 4, 2016, 3 Who Studied Unusual States of Matter Win Nobel Prize in Physics.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ill.eu/fr/presse-et-infos/infos/congratulations-to-the-2016-nobel-prize-laureates/ ill.eu October 4, 2016, Congratulations to the 2016 Physics Nobel Prize laureates !]
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rudolf Mossbauer]], Nobel Prize in Physics in 1961, succeed to [[Heinz Maier-Leibnitz]] in 1972 as the director of the institute.

The '''Institute for Sales and Account Management (ISAM)''' is a Dutch knowledge institute that was founded in 1996 as part of the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]]. ISAM conducts research in the field of [[neuroeconomics]]; a science in which [[economics]], [[psychology]], and [[neuroscience]] are combined.

Serving as an example is the research into the brain activity of salespeople, which can be detected through the use of fMRI scans. [[Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (fMRI) is a technique that can trace the location in the brains where someone is processing information at the moment that he or she is faced with a stimulus (e.g. interaction with a client). Thus, with the help of an fMRI scanner both the conscious as well as the unconscious brain processes can be traced. This study has been realized in cooperation with the [[Erasmus MC]] (medical center) and the [[University of Michigan]]. It has been published in the Journal of Marketing Research.

All knowledge that is acquired through ISAM research, is transferred to the (inter)national business world by means of postgraduate education programmes in the field of sales and account management.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

An '''invasive species''' is a species that is not native to a specific location (an [[introduced species]]), and that has a tendency to spread to a degree believed to cause damage to the environment, human economy or human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Ecosystem Consequences of Biological Invasions |author=Joan G.

The term as most often used applies to introduced species (also called "non-indigenous" or "non-native") that adversely affect the [[habitat]]s and [[bioregion]]s they invade economically, environmentally, or ecologically. Such invasive species may be either plants or animals and may disrupt by dominating a region, [[Wilderness|wilderness areas]], particular habitats, or [[wildland–urban interface]] land from loss of natural controls (such as [[Predation|predators]] or [[herbivore]]s). This includes non-native invasive plant species labeled as '''exotic pest plants''' and '''invasive exotics''' growing in native [[plant community|plant communities]].&lt;ref&gt;Exotic Pest Plant Council.

The term is also used by land managers, botanists, researchers, horticulturalists, conservationists, and the public for [[noxious weed]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cal-ipc.org/ip/inventory/pdf/Inventory1999.pdf Exotic Pest Plant Council]. p. 1. accessed 4/10/2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kudzu|kudzu vine]] (''Pueraria lobata''), [[Cortaderia jubata|Andean pampas grass]] (''Cortaderia jubata''), and [[Centaurea solstitialis|yellow starthistle]] (''Centaurea solstitialis'') are examples. An alternate usage broadens the term to include indigenous or "native" species along with ''non-native'' species, that have colonized natural areas (p.&amp;nbsp;136).&lt;ref name=neutral/&gt; [[Deer]] are an example, considered to be overpopulating their native zones and adjacent suburban gardens, by some in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] and [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific Coast]] regions of the United States.&lt;ref name="Rachael E."&gt;{{cite journal |last=Urbanek |first=Rachael E. |author2=K.R.

A nonadverse example is the common goldfish (''[[Carassius auratus]]''), which is found throughout the United States, but rarely achieves high densities (p.&amp;nbsp;136).&lt;ref name=neutral/&gt; Notable examples of invasive species include [[European rabbit]]s, [[grey squirrel]]s, [[domestic cat]]s, [[carp]] and ferrets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krishna|first=Neal|last2=Krishna|first2=Vandana M.|last3=Krishna|first3=Ryan N.|last4=Krishna|first4=Sampath|date=February 2018|title=The Invasiveness of the Genus Sylvilagus in Massachusetts and the Resulting Increase in Human Allergen Sensitization to Rabbits|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=141|issue=2|pages=AB236|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2017.12.747|issn=0091-6749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dispersal and subsequent proliferation of species is not solely an anthropogenic phenomenon. There are many mechanisms by which species from all Kingdoms have been able to travel across continents in short periods of time such as via floating rafts, or on wind currents. Charles Darwin performed many experiments to better understand long distance seed dispersal, and was able to germinate seeds from insect frass, faeces of waterfowl, dirt clods on the feet of birds, all of which may have traveled significant distances under their own power, or be blown off course by thousands of miles.

Invasion of long-established ecosystems by organisms from distant bio-regions is a natural phenomenon, which has likely been accelerated via hominid-assisted migration although this has not been adequately directly measured.

The definition of "native" is controversial in that there is no way to precisely determine nativity. For example, the ancestors of Equus ferus (modern horses) evolved in North America and radiated to Eurasia before becoming locally extinct. Upon returning to North America in 1493 during their hominid-assisted migration, it is debatable as to whether they were native or exotic to the continent of their evolutionary ancestors.

==Causes==
Scientists include species and ecosystem factors among the mechanisms that, when combined, establish invasiveness in a newly introduced species.

===Species based mechanisms===
While all species compete to survive, invasive species appear to have specific traits or specific combinations of traits that allow them to outcompete [[native species]]. In some cases, the competition is about rates of growth and reproduction. In other cases, species interact with each other more directly.

Researchers disagree about the usefulness of traits as invasiveness markers. One study found that of a list of invasive and noninvasive species, 86% of the invasive species could be identified from the traits alone.&lt;ref name="kolar"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kolar |first=C.S. |author2=D.M. Lodge |year=2001 |title=Progress in invasion biology: predicting invaders|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume=16 |issue=4 |pages=199–204 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02101-2 |pmid=11245943}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found invasive species tended to have only a small subset of the presumed traits and that many similar traits were found in noninvasive species, requiring other explanations.&lt;ref name="kolar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="theb"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thebaud |first=C. |author2=A.C.

Typically, an introduced species must survive at low population densities before it becomes invasive in a new location.&lt;ref name="tilm"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Tilman|first=D. |year=2004

| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0403458101
| pmid = 15243158 |issue= 30 |pmc= 503710}}&lt;/ref&gt; At low population densities, it can be difficult for the introduced species to reproduce and maintain itself in a new location, so a species might reach a location multiple times before it becomes established. Repeated patterns of human movement, such as ships sailing to and from ports or cars driving up and down highways offer repeated opportunities for establishment (also known as a high [[propagule pressure]]).&lt;ref name="verl"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Verling|first=E. |author2=G.M. Ruiz|author3=L.D. Smith|author4= B. Galil|author5= A.W. Miller|author6= K.R.

An introduced species might become invasive if it can outcompete native species for resources such as [[nutrient]]s, light, physical space, water, or food. If these species evolved under great [[Competition (biology)|competition]] or [[predation]], then the new environment may host fewer able competitors, allowing the invader to proliferate quickly. Ecosystems in which are being used to their fullest capacity by native species can be modeled as [[zero-sum]] systems in which any gain for the invader is a loss for the native. However, such [[unilateral]] competitive superiority (and extinction of native species with increased populations of the invader) is not the rule.&lt;ref name="stoh"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stohlgren |first=T.J. |author2= D. Binkley |year=1999 |title=Exotic plant species invade hot spots of native plant diversity |journal=Ecological Monographs |volume=69 |pages=25–46 |doi=10.1890/0012-9615(1999)069[0025:EPSIHS]2.0.CO;2|last3=Chong |first3=Geneva W. |last4=Kalkhan |first4=Mohammed A. |last5=Schell |first5=Lisa D. |last6=Bull |first6=Kelly A. |last7=Otsuki |first7=Yuka |last8=Newman |first8=Gregory |last9=Bashkin |first9=Michael |last10=Son |first10=Yowhan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sax"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sax |first= D.F. |author2= S.

An invasive species might be able to use resources that were previously unavailable to native species, such as deep water sources accessed by a long [[taproot]], or an ability to live on previously uninhabited soil types. For example, barbed goatgrass (''[[Aegilops triuncialis]]'') was introduced to [[California]] on [[serpentine soil]]s, which have low water-retention, low nutrient levels, a high [[magnesium]]/[[calcium]] ratio, and possible [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]] toxicity. Plant populations on these soils tend to show low density, but goatgrass can form dense stands on these soils and crowd out native species that have adapted poorly to serpentine soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huenneke |first=L. |author2=S.

Invasive species might alter their environment by releasing chemical compounds, modifying [[abiotic]] factors, or affecting the behaviour of herbivores, creating a positive or negative impact on other species. Some species, like ''[[Bryophyllum daigremontianum|Kalanchoe daigremontana]]'', produce [[allelopathy|allelopathic compounds]], that might have an inhibitory effect on competing species, and influence some soil processes like carbon and nitrogen mineralization.&lt;ref name="HERRERAFERRER-PARIS2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=HERRERA|first1=Ileana|last2=FERRER-PARIS|first2=José R.|last3=BENZO|first3=Diana|last4=FLORES|first4=Saúl|last5=GARCÍA|first5=Belkis|last6=NASSAR|first6=Jafet M.|title=An Invasive Succulent Plant (Kalanchoe daigremontiana) Influences Soil Carbon and Nitrogen Mineralization in a Neotropical Semiarid Zone|journal=Pedosphere|volume=28|issue=4|year=2018|pages=632–643|issn=1002-0160|doi=10.1016/S1002-0160(18)60029-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other species like ''[[Stapelia gigantea]]'' [[ecological facilitation|facilitates]] the recruitment of seedlings of other species in arid environments by providing appropriate microclimatic conditions and preventing herbivory in early stages of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herrera|first1=Ileana|last2=Ferrer-Paris|first2=José R.|last3=Hernández-Rosas|first3=José I.|last4=Nassar|first4=Jafet M.|title=Impact of two invasive succulents on native-seedling recruitment in Neotropical arid environments|journal=Journal of Arid Environments|date=2016|volume=132|pages=15–25|doi=10.1016/j.jaridenv.2016.04.007|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301927334|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples are ''[[Centaurea solstitialis]]'' (yellow starthistle) and ''Centaurea diffusa'' ([[diffuse knapweed]]). These [[Eastern Europe]]an [[noxious weed]]s have spread through the [[Western United States|western]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast states]]. Experiments show that [[8-hydroxyquinoline]], a chemical produced at the root of ''C. diffusa'', has a negative effect only on plants that have not co-evolved with it. Such co-evolved native plants have also evolved defenses. ''C. diffusa'' and ''C. solstitialis'' do not appear in their native habitats to be overwhelmingly successful competitors. Success or lack of success in one habitat does not necessarily imply success in others. Conversely, examining habitats in which a species is less successful can reveal novel weapons to defeat invasiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hierro |first=J.L. |author2=R.M. Callaway |year=2003 |title=Allelopathy and exotic plant invasion |journal=Plant and Soil |volume=256 |issue=1 |pages=29–39 |doi=10.1023/A:1026208327014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vivan"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Vivanco|first=J.M. |last2=Bais |first2=H.P. |last3=Stermitz |first3=F.R. |last4=Thelen |first4=G.C. |last5=Callaway |first5=R.M. |year=2004 |title=Biogeographical variation in community response to root allelochemistry: Novel weapons and exotic invasion |journal=Ecology Letters |volume=7|issue=4 |pages= 285–292 |doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2004.00576.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in fire regimens are another form of facilitation. ''[[Bromus tectorum]]'', originally from Eurasia, is highly fire-adapted. It not only spreads rapidly after burning but also increases the frequency and intensity (heat) of fires by providing large amounts of dry [[detritus]] during the fire season in western North America. In areas where it is widespread, it has altered the local fire regimen so much that native plants cannot survive the frequent fires, allowing ''B. tectorum'' to further extend and maintain dominance in its introduced range.&lt;ref name="Brooks 2004 677–688"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brooks |first=M.L. |last2=D'Antonio |first2=C.M. |last3=Richardson |first3=D.M. |last4=Grace |first4=J.B. |last5=Keeley |first5=J.E. |last6=DiTomaso |first6=J.M. |last7=Hobbs |first7=R.J. |last8=Pellant |first8=M. |last9=Pyke |first9=D. &lt;!--exactly 9 authors--&gt; |year=2004 |title=Effects of invasive alien plants on fire |journal=BioScience |issue=7 |pages=677–688 |doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2004)054[0677:EOIAPO]2.0.CO;2 |volume=54|url=https://naldc.nal.usda.gov/naldc/download.xhtml?id=42480&amp;content=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facilitation also occurs where one species physically modifies a habitat in ways that are advantageous to other species. For example, [[zebra mussel]]s increase habitat complexity on lake floors, providing crevices in which [[invertebrate]]s live. This increase in complexity, together with the nutrition provided by the waste products of mussel [[filter feeder|filter-feeding]], increases the density and diversity of [[Benthic zone|benthic]] invertebrate communities.&lt;ref name="silv"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Silver Botts |first=P. |last2=Patterson |first2=B.A. |last3=Schlosser |first3=D. |year=1996 |title=Zebra mussel effects on benthic invertebrates: Physical or biotic?|journal=Journal of the North American Benthological Society |volume= |issue=15 |pages= 179–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecosystem-based mechanisms===
In [[ecosystem]]s, the amount of available resources and the extent to which those resources are used by organisms determines the effects of additional species on the ecosystem. In stable ecosystems, equilibrium exists in the use of available resources. These mechanisms describe a situation in which the ecosystem has suffered a disturbance, which changes the fundamental nature of the ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byers |first=J.E. |year=2002 |title=Impact of non-indigenous species on natives enhanced by anthropogenic alteration of selection regimes |journal=Oikos |volume=97 |issue=3 |pages=449–458 |doi=10.1034/j.1600-0706.2002.970316.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When changes such as a [[forest fire]] occur, normal succession favors native [[grass]]es and [[forb]]s. An introduced species that can spread faster than natives can use resources that would have been available to native species, squeezing them out. [[Nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]] are often the limiting factors in these situations.&lt;ref name="Davis 2000 528–534"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Davis|first=M.A. |last2=Grime |first2=J.P. |last3=Thompson |first3=K. |year=2000 |title=Fluctuating resources in plant communities: A general theory of invisibility |journal=Journal of Ecology |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=528–534 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2745.2000.00473.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every species occupies a ''[[Ecological niche|niche]]'' in its native ecosystem; some species fill large and varied roles, while others are highly specialized. Some invading species fill niches that are not used by native species, and they also can create new niches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Ecology|last=Fath|first=Brian D.|publisher=Elsevier Science; 1 edition|year=2008|isbn=978-0444520333|location=Amsterdam, The Netherlands|pages=1089}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this type can be found within the ''[[Lampropholis delicata]]'' species of skink.

Ecosystem changes can alter species' distributions. For example, [[edge effect]]s describe what happens when part of an ecosystem is disturbed as when land is cleared for agriculture. The boundary between remaining undisturbed habitat and the newly cleared land itself forms a distinct habitat, creating new winners and losers and possibly hosting species that would not thrive outside the boundary habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alverson|first=William S.|last2=Waller|first2=Donald M.|last3=Solheim|first3=Stephen L.|date=1988|title=Forests Too Deer: Edge Effects in Northern Wisconsin|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=2|issue=4|pages=348–358|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.1988.tb00199.x|jstor=2386294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One interesting finding in studies of invasive species has shown that introduced populations have great potential for rapid adaptation and this is used to explain how so many introduced species are able to establish and become invasive in new environments. When bottlenecks and founder effects cause a great decrease in the population size and may constrict genetic variation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xu|first=Cheng-Yuan|last2=Tang|first2=Shaoqing|last3=Fatemi|first3=Mohammad|last4=Gross|first4=Caroline L.|last5=Julien|first5=Mic H.|last6=Curtis|first6=Caitlin|last7=van Klinken|first7=Rieks D.|date=2015-09-01|title=Population structure and genetic diversity of invasive Phyla canescens: implications for the evolutionary potential|journal=Ecosphere|language=en|volume=6|issue=9|pages=1–21|doi=10.1890/ES14-00374.1|issn=2150-8925}}&lt;/ref&gt; the individuals begin to show additive variance as opposed to epistatic variance.

Adaptation then proceeds to respond to the selective pressures of the new environment. These responses would most likely be due to temperature and climate change, or the presence of native species whether it be predator or prey.&lt;ref name="Eunmi 2002 386-391"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Lee |first= Carol Eunmi | title= Evolutionary genetics of invasive species |journal= Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution |volume= 17 |issue= 8 |pages= 386–391 | doi = 10.1016/s0169-5347(02)02554-5 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adaptations include changes in morphology, physiology, phenology, and plasticity.

Rapid adaptive evolution in these species leads to offspring that have higher fitness and are better suited for their environment.

This is key in adaptive evolution because the main goal is how to best be suited to the ecosystem that the species has been introduced. The ability to accomplish this as quickly as possible will lead to a population with a very high fitness. Pre-adaptations and evolution after the initial introduction also play a role in the success of the introduced species. If the species has adapted to a similar ecosystem or contains traits that happen to be well suited to the area that it is introduced, it is more likely to fare better in the new environment. This, in addition to evolution that takes place after introduction, all determine if the species will be able to become established in the new ecosystem and if it will reproduce and thrive.

==Ecology==
===Traits of invaded ecosystems===
In 1958, Charles S. Elton&lt;ref name="elton"&gt;{{cite book |last= Elton|first=C.S. |others=Foreword by Daniel Simberloff |title=The Ecology of Invasions by Animals and Plants |origyear=1958 |year=2000 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-20638-7 |page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that ecosystems with higher [[species diversity]] were less subject to invasive species because of fewer available niches. Other ecologists later pointed to highly diverse, but heavily invaded ecosystems and argued that ecosystems with high species diversity were more susceptible to invasion.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stohlgren |first=T.J. |last2=Binkley |first2=D. |last3=Chong |first3=G.W. |last4=Kalkhan |first4=M.A. |last5=Schell |first5=L.D. |last6=Bull |first6=K.A. |last7=Otsuki |first7=Y. |last8=Newman |first8=G. |last9=Bashkin |first9=M. |last10=Son |first10=Y. |year=1999 |title=Exotic plant species invade hot spots of native plant diversity |journal=Ecological Monographs |volume=69 |pages=25–46 |doi=10.1890/0012-9615(1999)069[0025:EPSIHS]2.0.CO;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This debate hinged on the [[Scale (spatial)|spatial scale]] at which invasion studies were performed, and the issue of how diversity affects susceptibility remained unresolved as of 2011. Small-scale studies tended to show a negative relationship between diversity and invasion, while large-scale studies tended to show the reverse. The latter result may be a side-effect of invasives' ability to capitalize on increased resource availability and weaker species interactions that are more common when larger samples are considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Byers |first=J.E. |author2=E.G.

Invaded ecosystems may have experienced disturbance, typically human-induced.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Such a disturbance may give invasive species a chance to establish themselves with less competition from natives less able to adapt to a disturbed ecosystem.&lt;ref name="tilm"/&gt;

===Vectors===
Non-native species have many ''[[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]s'', including biogenic vectors,&lt;!--what is a biogenic vector?--&gt; but most invasions are associated with human activity. Natural [[Range (biology)|range]] extensions are common in many species, but the rate and magnitude of human-mediated extensions in these species tend to be much larger than natural extensions, and humans typically carry specimens greater distances than natural forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cassey |first= P |author2=T.M.

An early human vector occurred when prehistoric humans introduced the [[Pacific rat]] (''Rattus exulans'') to Polynesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Matisoo-Smith |first=E. |author2=R.M.

[[File:EriocheirSinensis1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chinese mitten crab]] (''Eriocheir sinensis'')]]
Vectors include plants or seeds imported for [[horticulture]]. The [[pet trade]] moves animals across borders, where they can escape and become invasive. Organisms stow away on transport vehicles.

The arrival of invasive [[propagule]]s to a new site is a function of the site's invasibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leung |first=B. |author2=N.E. Mandrak  |year=2007 |title= The risk of establishment of aquatic invasive species: joining invasibility and propagule pressure |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B]] |volume=274 |pages=2733–2739|doi= 10.1098/rspb.2007.0841 |pmid=17711834 |issue=1625 |pmc=2275890}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Species have also been introduced intentionally. For example, to feel more "at home," American colonists formed "Acclimation Societies" that repeatedly imported birds that were native to Europe to North America and other distant lands. In 2008, U.S. postal workers in Pennsylvania noticed noises coming from inside a box from Taiwan; the box contained more than two dozen live beetles. [[Agricultural Research Service]] entomologists identified them as [[rhinoceros beetle]], [[hercules beetle]], and [[Phalacrognathus muelleri|king stag beetle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/jan10/insects0110.htm |title=Our Invaluable Invertebrate Collections |publisher=Ars.usda.gov |accessdate=2011-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because these species were not native to the U.S., they could have threatened native ecosystems.&lt;!--were they actually invasive or just non-native?--&gt; To prevent exotic species from becoming a problem in the U.S., special handling and permits are required when living materials are shipped from foreign countries. [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] programs such as [[Smuggling Interdiction and Trade Compliance]] (SITC) attempt to prevent exotic species outbreaks in America.

Many invasive species, once they are dominant in the area, are essential to the ecosystem of that area. If they are removed from the location it could be harmful to that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zavaleta|first1=Erika|last2=Hobbs|first2=Richard|last3=Mooney|first3=Harold|title=Viewing invasive species removal in a whole-ecosystem context|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|date=August 2001|volume=16|issue=8|page=458|url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/parry/invasivesseminar_readings/Zavaleta_etal_2001.pdf|accessdate=21 October 2017|doi=10.1016/s0169-5347(01)02194-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economics plays a major role in exotic species introduction. High demand for the valuable [[Chinese mitten crab]] is one explanation for the possible intentional release of the species in foreign waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marine Pollution and Climate Change|last=Seinfeld|first=John H.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==== Within the Aquatic Environment ====
The development of maritime trade has rapidly affected the way marine organisms are transported within the ocean. Two ways marine organisms are transported to new environments are hull fouling and ballast water transport. In fact, Molnar et al. 2008 documented the pathways of hundreds of marine invasive species and found that shipping was the dominant mechanism for the transfer of invasive species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Molnar|first=Jennifer L|last2=Gamboa|first2=Rebecca L|last3=Revenga|first3=Carmen|last4=Spalding|first4=Mark D|date=2008|title=Assessing the global threat of invasive species to marine biodiversity|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|language=en|volume=6|issue=9|pages=485–492|doi=10.1890/070064|issn=1540-9295}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 1010 Discharging ballast water.jpg|thumb|Cargo ship de-ballasting]]
Many marine organisms have the capacity to attach themselves to vessel hulls. Therefore, these organisms are easily transported from one body of water to another and are a significant risk factor for a biological invasion event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Drake|first=John|date=2007|title=Hull fouling is a risk factor for intercontinental species exchange in aquatic ecosystems|journal=Aquatic Invasions|volume=2|issue=2|pages=121–131|doi=10.3391/ai.2007.2.2.7|issn=1818-5487}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, controlling for vessel hull fouling is voluntary and there are no regulations currently in place to manage hull fouling. However, California and New Zealand have announced more stringent control for vessel hull fouling within their respective jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gard.no/web/updates/content/24305557/biofouling-moves-up-the-regulatory-agenda.|title=Biofouling moves up the regulatory agenda - GARD|website=www.gard.no|language=en|access-date=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other main vector for the transport of non-native aquatic species is ballast water. [[Ballast water discharge and the environment|Ballast water]] taken up at sea and released in port by transoceanic vessels is the largest vector for non-native aquatic species invasions.&lt;sup&gt;[[Invasive species#cite%20note-MolnarGamboa2008-43|[47]]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Xu|first=Jian|last2=Wickramarathne|first2=Thanuka L.|last3=Chawla|first3=Nitesh V.|last4=Grey|first4=Erin K.|last5=Steinhaeuser|first5=Karsten|last6=Keller|first6=Reuben P.|last7=Drake|first7=John M.|last8=Lodge|first8=David M.|date=2014-08-24|title=Improving management of aquatic invasions by integrating shipping network, ecological, and environmental data: data mining for social good|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2623330.2623364|publisher=ACM|pages=1699–1708|doi=10.1145/2623330.2623364|isbn=9781450329569}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it is estimated that 10,000 different species, many of which are non-indigenous, are transported via ballast water each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Streftaris|first=N|last2=Zenetos|first2=Argyro|last3=Papathanassiou|first3=Enangelos|date=2005|title=Globalisation in marine ecosystems: The story of non-indigenous marine species across European seas|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/253862066|journal=Oceanography and Marine Biology|volume=43|pages=419–453|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these species are considered harmful and can negatively impact their new environment. For example, freshwater [[zebra mussel]]s, native to the [[Black Sea|Black]], [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Sea of Azov|Azov seas]], most likely reached the [[Great Lakes]] via ballast water from a transoceanic vessel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Zebra mussels outcompete other native organisms for oxygen and food, such as algae. Although the zebra mussel invasion was first noted in 1988, and a mitigation plan was successfully implemented shortly thereafter, the plan had a serious flaw or loophole, whereby ships loaded with cargo when they reached the [[St. Lawrence Seaway|Seaway]] were not tested because their ballast water tanks were empty. However, even in an empty ballast tank, there remains a puddle of water filled with organisms that could be released at the next port (when the tank is filled with water after unloading the cargo, the ship takes on ballast water which mixes with the puddles and then everything including the living organisms in the puddles is discharged at the next port).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.jsonline.com/news/wisconsin/98880204.html/|title=Noxious cargo|access-date=2018-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current regulations for the Great Lakes rely on ‘salinity shock’ to kill freshwater organisms left in ballast tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.glc.org/wp-content/uploads/GLC-BW-Reg-Summary-11.14.16.pdf|title=Status of Ballast Water Discharge Regulations in the Great Lakes Region|last=Great Lake Commission|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though ballast water regulations are in place to protect against potentially invasive species, there exists a loophole for organisms in the 10-50 micron size class. For organisms between 10 and 50 microns, such as certain types of phytoplankton, current regulations allow less than 10 cells per milliliter be present in discharge from treatment systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dco.uscg.mil/Portals/9/DCO%20Documents/5p/5ps/NVIC/2018/NVIC-01_18.pdf|title=Ballast Water Management for Control of Non-Indigenous Species in Waters of the United States|last=USCG|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discharge gets released when a ship takes on cargo at a port so the discharged water is not necessarily the same as the receiving body of water. Since many species of phytoplankton are less than 10 microns in size and reproduce asexually, only one cell released into the environment could exponentially grow into many thousands of cells over a short amount of time. This loophole could have detrimental effects to the environment. For example, some species in the genus ''Pseudo-nitzschia'' are smaller than 10 microns in width and contain domoic acid, a neurotoxin. If toxic ''Pseudo-nitzschia'' spp. are alive in ballast discharge and get released into their “new environment” they could cause domoic acid poisoning in shellfish, marine mammals and birds.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trainer|first=Vera L.|last2=Bates|first2=Stephen S.|last3=Lundholm|first3=Nina|last4=Thessen|first4=Anne E.|last5=Cochlan|first5=William P.|last6=Adams|first6=Nicolaus G.|last7=Trick|first7=Charles G.|date=2012|title=Pseudo-nitzschia physiological ecology, phylogeny, toxicity, monitoring and impacts on ecosystem health|journal=Harmful Algae|volume=14|pages=271–300|doi=10.1016/j.hal.2011.10.025|issn=1568-9883|hdl=1912/5118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, human deaths related to domoic acid poisoning have been prevented because of stringent monitoring programs that arose after a domoic acid outbreak in Canada in 1987.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ballast water regulations need to be more rigorous to prevent future ramifications associated with the potential release of toxic and invasive phytoplankton.

Another important factor to consider about marine invasive species is the role of environmental changes associated with climate change, such as an increase in ocean temperature. There have been multiple studies suggesting an increase in ocean temperature will cause range shifts in organisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Occhipinti-Ambrogi|first=Anna|date=2007|title=Global change and marine communities: Alien species and climate change|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|volume=55|issue=7–9|pages=342–352|doi=10.1016/j.marpolbul.2006.11.014|pmid=17239404|issn=0025-326X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rahel|first=Frank J.|last2=Olden|first2=Julian D.|date=2008|title=Assessing the effects of climate change on aquatic invasive species|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=22|issue=3|pages=521–533|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00950.x|issn=1523-1739|pmid=18577081}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could have detrimental effects on the environment as new species interactions emerge. For example, Hua and Hwang proposed that organisms in a ballast tank of a ship traveling from the temperature zone through tropical waters can experience temperature fluctuations as much as 20&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hua|first=J.|last2=Hwang|first2=W.H.|date=2012|title=Effects of voyage routing on the survival of microbes in ballast water|journal=Ocean Engineering|volume=42|pages=165–175|doi=10.1016/j.oceaneng.2012.01.013|issn=0029-8018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further examine the effects of temperature on organisms transported on hulls or in ballast water, Lenz et al. (2018) carried out study where they conducted a double heat stress experiment. Their results suggest that heat challenges organisms face during transport may enhance the stress tolerance of species in their non-native range by selecting for genetically adapted genotypes that will survive a second applied heat stress, such as increased ocean temperature in the founder population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lenz|first=Mark|last2=Ahmed|first2=Yasser|last3=Canning-Clode|first3=João|last4=Díaz|first4=Eliecer|last5=Eichhorn|first5=Sandra|last6=Fabritzek|first6=Armin G.|last7=da Gama|first7=Bernardo A.

Since some studies have suggested increased temperature tolerance of “hijackers” on ships’ hulls or in ballast water, it is necessary to develop more comprehensive fouling and ballast water management plans in an effort to prevent against future possible invasions as environmental conditions continue to change around the world.

===Impacts of wildfire and firefighting===
Invasive species often exploit disturbances to an ecosystem ([[wildfire]]s, roads, foot trails) to colonize an area. Large wildfires can sterilize soils, while adding a variety of nutrients.&lt;ref name="Davis 2000 528–534"/&gt;  In the resulting free-for-all, formerly entrenched species lose their advantage, leaving more room for invasives. In such circumstances plants that can regenerate from their roots have an advantage. Non-natives with this ability can benefit from a low intensity fire burns that removes surface vegetation, leaving natives that rely on seeds for propagation to find their niches occupied when their seeds finally sprout.&lt;ref name="Brooks 2004 677–688"/&gt;

Wildfires often occur in remote areas, needing fire suppression crews to travel through pristine forest to reach the site. The crews can bring invasive seeds with them. If any of these stowaway seeds become established, a thriving colony of invasives can erupt in as few as six weeks, after which controlling the outbreak can need years of continued attention to prevent further spread. Also, disturbing the soil surface, such as cutting firebreaks, destroys native cover, exposes soil, and can accelerate invasions. In suburban and [[wildland-urban interface]] areas, the vegetation clearance and brush removal ordinances of municipalities for [[Defensible space (fire control)|defensible space]] can result in excessive removal of native shrubs and perennials that exposes the soil to more light and less competition for invasive plant species.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Fire suppression vehicles are often major culprits in such outbreaks, as the vehicles are often driven on back roads overgrown with invasive plant species. The undercarriage of the vehicle becomes a prime vessel of transport. In response, on large fires, washing stations "decontaminate" vehicles before engaging in suppression activities.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} Large wildfires attract firefighters from remote places, further increasing the potential for seed transport.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Effects==
[[File:Gator and Python.jpg|thumb|right|An [[American alligator]] attacking a [[Burmese python in Florida]]; the [[Burmese python]] is an invasive species which is posing a threat to many indigenous species, including the alligator]]

===Ecological===
Land clearing and human habitation put significant pressure on local species. Disturbed habitats are prone to invasions that can have adverse effects on local ecosystems, changing ecosystem functions. A species of wetland plant known as {{okina}}ae{{okina}}ae in Hawaii (the indigenous ''[[Bacopa monnieri]]'') is regarded as a [[Pest (organism)|pest]] species in artificially manipulated water bird refuges because it quickly covers shallow mudflats established for endangered Hawaiian stilt (''[[black-winged stilt|Himantopus mexicanus knudseni]]''), making these undesirable feeding areas for the birds.

Multiple successive introductions of different non-native species can have interactive effects; the introduction of a second non-native species can enable the first invasive species to flourish. Examples of this are the introductions of the [[amethyst gem clam]] (''Gemma gemma'') and the European green crab (''[[Carcinus maenas]]''). The gem clam was introduced into California's [[Bodega Bay|Bodega Harbor]] from the East Coast of the United States a century ago. It had been found in small quantities in the harbor but had never displaced the native clam species (''Nutricola'' spp.). In the mid-1990s, the introduction of the European green crab, found to prey preferentially on the native clams, resulted in a decline of the native clams and an increase of the introduced clam populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grosholz |first= E.D. |year= 2005 |title=Recent biological invasion may hasten invasional meltdown by accelerating historical introductions|journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |volume=102 |pages=1088–1091 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0308547102 |pmid=15657121 |issue=4 |pmc=545825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Waterberg Biosphere|Waterberg]] region of South Africa, cattle grazing over the past six centuries has allowed invasive scrub and small trees to displace much of the original [[grassland]], resulting in a massive reduction in [[Fodder|forage]] for native bovids and other grazers. Since the 1970s, large scale efforts have been underway to reduce invasive species; partial success has led to re-establishment of many species that had dwindled or left the region. Examples of these species are [[giraffe]], [[blue wildebeest]], [[impala]], [[kudu]] and [[white rhino]].

Invasive species can change the functions of ecosystems. For example, invasive plants can alter the fire regime (cheatgrass, ''[[Drooping Brome|Bromus tectorum]]''), nutrient cycling (smooth cordgrass ''[[Spartina alterniflora]]''), and hydrology (''[[Tamarix]]'') in native ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mack |first= R. |author2=D.

===Geomorphological===
Primary geomorphological effects of invasive plants are bioconstruction and bioprotection. For example, Kudzu [[Pueraria montana]], a vine native to Asia was widely introduced in the southeastern USA in the early 20th century to control soil erosion.  While primary effects of invasive animals are bioturbation, bioerosion, and bioconstruction.  For example, invasion of Chinese mitten crab [[Eriocheir sinensis]] have resulted in higher bioturbation and bioerosion rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fei |first= S. |author2=J. Philips |author3=M. Shouse|year=2015 |title=Biogeomorphic Impacts of Invasive Species |journal=[[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics]] |volume=45 |pages=69–87 |doi=10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-120213-091928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic===
Some invaders cause negative benefits towards the economy of the local area. For example, in the Great Lakes Region the [[sea lamprey]] is an invasive species that acts as a predator. In its original habitat, the sea lamprey used co-evolution to act as a parasite without killing the host organism. However, in the Great Lakes Region, this co-evolutionary link is non existent, so the sea lamprey acts as a predator, and can consume up to 40 pounds of fish in its 12-18  month feeding period.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glfc.org/sea-lamprey.php|title=Great Lakes Fishery Commission - Sea Lamprey|website=www.glfc.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea lampreys prey on all types of large fish such as lake trout and salmon. The sea lampreys' destructive effects towards large fish negatively affects the fishing industry and has helped collapse the population of some economy dependent species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Economic opportunities====
Some invasions offer potential commercial benefits. For instance, [[silver carp]] and [[common carp]] can be harvested for human food and exported to markets already familiar with the product, or processed into [[pet food]]s, or [[mink]] feed. [[Water hyacinth]] can be turned into fuel by [[methane digesters]],&lt;ref name = wolv&gt;''Energy from vascular plant wastewater treatment systems – Eichhornia crassipes, Spirodela lemna, Hydrocotyle ranunculoides, Pueraria lobata, [[biomass]] harvested for fuel production''.

Duke.&lt;/ref&gt; and other invasive plants can also be harvested and utilized as a source of [[bioenergy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Biomass of invasive plant species as a potential feedstock for bioenergy production|first1=Koenraad|last1=Van Meerbeek|first2=Lise|last2=Appels|first3=Raf|last3=Dewil|first4=Annelies|last4=Calmeyn|first5=Pieter|last5=Lemmens|first6=Bart|last6=Muys|first7=Martin|last7=Hermy|date=1 May 2015|journal=Biofuels, Bioprod. Bioref.|volume=9|issue=3|pages=273–282|doi=10.1002/bbb.1539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Benefits=====
Although most people focus on the negative effects of invasive and non-native species, they can actually be harmless or even beneficial in some cases. Ecosystems thrive because of biodiversity and some need non-native species in order to succeed. There are four major ways that non-natives can be very beneficial for an ecosystem. The first is that they can provide a suitable habitat or food source for other organisms. In areas where a native has become extinct or reached a point that it cannot be restored, non-native species can fill their role. A good example of this is the Tamarisk, a non-native woody plant, and the Southwestern Willow Flycatcher, an endangered bird. 75% of Southwestern Willow Flycatcher were found to nest in these plants and their success was the same as the flycatchers that had nested in native plants. The removal of Tamarisk would be detrimental to Southwestern Willow Flycatcher as their native nesting sites are unable to be restored. The second way that non-native species can be beneficial is that they act as catalysts for restoration. This is because the presence of non-native species increases the heterogeneity and biodiversity in an ecosystem. This increase in heterogeneity can create microclimates in sparse and eroded ecosystems, which then promotes the growth and reestablishment of native species. Another benefit of non-native species is that they can act as a substitute for an existing ecosystem engineer. In many cases, non-native species can be introduced to fill a niche that had previously been occupied by a native species. Many non-native species have similar characteristics and functions and can keep an ecosystem functioning properly without collapse. An example of this is the Aldabra giant tortoises, which were introduced on several small islands and have successfully taken over the roles of herbivore and seed disperser. The last benefit of non-native species is that they provided ecosystem services. There are many examples of this. The major one being pollinators. The American Honey bee was introduced in the rainforest to pollinate fragmented landscapes that native species cannot. Also, non-native species can function as biocontrol agents to limit the effects of invasive species. Such as the use of non-native species to control agricultural pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SCHLAEPFER|first=MARTIN A.|last2=SAX|first2=DOV F.|last3=OLDEN|first3=JULIAN D.|date=2011-02-22|title=The Potential Conservation Value of Non-Native Species|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=25|issue=3|pages=428–437|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2010.01646.x|pmid=21342267|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-native species can have other benefits. [[Chesapeake Bay#Depletion of oysters|Asian oysters]], for example, filter water pollutants better than native{{clarify|reason=native to where?|date=September 2012}} oysters. They also grow faster and withstand disease better than natives. Biologists are currently considering releasing this [[mollusk]] in the [[Chesapeake Bay]] to help restore oyster stocks and remove pollution. A recent study by the [[Johns Hopkins School of Public Health]] found the Asian oyster could significantly benefit the bay's deteriorating water quality.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Pelton, ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'', May 26, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- does the asian threaten the local?--&gt; Additionally, some species have invaded an area so long ago that they have found their own beneficial niche in the environment, a term referred to as [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalisation]]. For example, ''[[Lasioglossum leucozonium|L. leucozonium]]'', shown by population genetic analysis to be an invasive species in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Successful Biological Invasion despite a Severe Genetic Load|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2007-09-12|issn = 1932-6203|pmc = 1964518|pmid = 17848999|volume = 2|issue = 9|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0000868|first = Amro|last = Zayed|first2 = Şerban A.|last2 = Constantin|first3 = Laurence|last3 = Packer|pages=e868}}&lt;/ref&gt; has become an important pollinator of [[Rubus|caneberry]] as well as [[Cucurbitaceae|cucurbit]], [[apple trees]], and blueberry bushes.&lt;ref name="An Assessment of Non-Apis Bees as Fruit and Vegetable Crop Pollinators in Southwest Virginia"&gt;Adamson, Nancy Lee.

=====Invasivorism=====
''See also [[:Category:Edible invasive species]]''

Invasive species are flora and fauna whose introduction into a habitat disrupts the native eco-system. In response, Invasivorism is a movement that explores the idea of eating invasive species in order to control, reduce, or eliminate their populations. Chefs from around the world have begun seeking out and using invasive species as alternative ingredients. [[Miya's]] of [[New Haven]], [[Connecticut]] created the first invasive species menu in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/invasive-species-menu-of-a-world-class-chef/|title=Invasive Species Menu of a World-Class Chef|journal=Scientific American|volume=309|issue=3|pages=40–43|date=September 1, 2013|author= Bun Lai |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0913-40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeptics point out that once a foreign species has entrenched itself in a new place—such as the Indo-Pacific lionfish that has now virtually taken over the waters of the Western Atlantic, Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico—eradication is almost impossible. Critics argue that encouraging consumption might have the unintended effect of spreading harmful species even more widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/world-on-a-plate/2015/feb/06/cooking-cant-solve-the-invasive-threat|title=Cooking can't solve the threat of invasive species|author=Emma Bryce|date=6 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=16 October 2017|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A dish that features whole fried invasive lionfish at Fish Fish of Miami, Florida.jpg|thumb|A dish that features whole fried invasive lionfish at Fish Fish of Miami, Florida]]
Proponents of invasivorism argue that humans have the ability to eat away any species that it has an appetite for, pointing to the many animals which humans have been able to hunt to extinction—such as the [[Dodo]] bird, the [[Caribbean monk seal]], and the [[passenger pigeon]]. Proponents of invasivorism also point to the success that Jamaica has had in significantly decreasing the population of [[lionfish]] by encouraging the consumption of the fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/invasive-lionfish-kings-caribbean-may-met-match-011600208.html|title=Invasive Lionfish, the Kings of the Caribbean, May Have Met Their Match|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Costs====
Economic costs from invasive species can be separated into direct costs through production loss in agriculture and forestry, and management costs. Estimated damage and control cost of invasive species in the U.S. alone amount to more than $138&amp;nbsp;billion annually.&lt;ref name="pimental"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pimentel |first= D. |last2= R. |first2= Zuniga  |last3= Morrison |first3= D |year= 2005 |title=Update on the environmental and economic costs associated with alien-invasive species in the United States |journal=Ecological Economics |volume=52 |issue= 3|pages=273–288 |url=|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2004.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic losses can also occur through loss of recreational and tourism revenues.&lt;ref name="simb"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simberloff |first=D. |year=2001 |title=Biological invasions - How are they affecting us, and what can we do about them? |journal=Western North American Naturalist |volume= 61 |pages=308–315}}&lt;/ref&gt; When economic costs of invasions are calculated as production loss and management costs, they are low because they do not consider environmental damage; if monetary values were assigned to the extinction of species, loss in biodiversity, and loss of [[ecosystem services]], costs from impacts of invasive species would drastically increase.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt; The following examples from different sectors of the economy demonstrate the impact of biological invasions.

It is often argued that the key to reducing the costs of invasive species damage and management is early detection and rapid response,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=2008–2012 National Invasive Species Management Plan.|last=|first=|publisher=National Invasive Species Council, Department of the Interior|year=2008|isbn=|location=Washington, DC.|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that incurring an initial cost of searching for and finding an invasive species and quickly controlling it, while the population is small, is less expensive that managing the invasive population when it is widespread and already causing damage. However, an intense search for the invader is only important to reduce costs in cases where the invasive species is (1) not frequently reintroduced into the managed area and (2) cost effective to search for and find.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Nyrop|first2=Jan P.|last3=Ellner|first3=Stephen P.|date=2016-06-01|title=The economic benefit of time-varying surveillance effort for invasive species management|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|language=en|volume=53|issue=3|pages=712–721|doi=10.1111/1365-2664.12617|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plant industry====
Weeds reduce yield in agriculture, though they may provide essential nutrients. Some deep-rooted weeds can "mine" nutrients (see [[dynamic accumulator]]) from the subsoil and deposit them on the topsoil, while others provide habitat for beneficial insects or provide foods for pest species. Many weed species are accidental introductions that accompany seeds and imported plant material. Many introduced weeds in pastures compete with native forage plants, threaten young cattle (e.g., leafy spurge, ''[[Euphorbia esula]]'') or are unpalatable because of thorns and spines (e.g., [[yellow starthistle]]). Forage loss from invasive weeds on pastures amounts to nearly [[US$]]1&amp;nbsp;billion in the U.S. alone.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt; A decline in pollinator services and loss of fruit production has been caused by [[Western honeybee|honey bees]] infected by the invasive [[varroa mite]]. Introduced rats (''[[Rattus rattus]]'' and ''[[Rattus norvegicus|R. norvegicus]]'') have become serious pests on farms, destroying stored grains.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt;

Invasive plant pathogens and insect vectors for plant diseases can also suppress agricultural yields and nursery stock.  Citrus greening is a bacterial disease vectored by the invasive Asian citrus psyllid (ACP).  Because of the impacts of this disease on citrus crops, citrus is under quarantine and highly regulated in areas where ACP has been found.&lt;ref&gt;2013. "Citrus Greening."

Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aquaculture====
[[Aquaculture]] is a very common vector of species introductions – mainly of species with economic potential (e.g., ''[[Oreochromis niloticus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Azevedo-Santos|first= V.M. |author2=O.

====Forestry====

====Tourism and recreation====
Invasive species can impact outdoor recreation, such as fishing, hunting, hiking, wildlife viewing, and water-based activities. They can damage a wide array of environmental services that are important to recreation, including, but not limited to, water quality and quantity, plant and animal diversity, and species abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eiswerth |first=M.E. |year=2005 |title=Input-output modeling, outdoor recreation, and the economic impacts of weeds |journal=Weed Science |volume=53 |pages=130–137 |doi=10.1614/WS-04-022R |last2=Darden |first2=Tim D. |last3=Johnson |first3=Wayne S. |last4=Agapoff |first4=Jeanmarie |last5=Harris |first5=Thomas R.|url=http://www.bioone.org/doi/10.1614/WS-04-022R |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eiswerth states, "very little research has been performed to estimate the corresponding economic losses at spatial scales such as regions, states, and watersheds".

===Health===
Encroachment of humans into previously remote ecosystems has exposed exotic diseases such as [[HIV]]&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt; to the wider population. Introduced birds (e.g. pigeons), rodents and insects (e.g. mosquito, flea, louse and [[tsetse fly]] pests) can serve as vectors and reservoirs of human afflictions. The introduced Chinese mitten crabs are carriers of [[Paragonimus westermani|Asian lung fluke]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Aquatic invasive species.

For instance, pesticides applied to treat a particular pest species could pollute soil and surface water.&lt;ref name="pimental" /&gt;

===Biodiversity===
{{Main|Biodiversity}}

Biotic invasion is considered one of the five top drivers for global [[biodiversity loss]] and is increasing because of tourism and [[globalization]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} This may be particularly true in inadequately regulated [[fresh water]] systems, though [[quarantine]]s and [[ballast water]] rules have improved the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Invasive species may drive local native species to extinction via [[Competition (biology)|competitive]] exclusion, [[Ecological niche|niche]] displacement, or [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]isation with related native species. Therefore, besides their economic ramifications, alien invasions may result in extensive changes in the structure, composition and global distribution of the biota of sites of introduction, leading ultimately to the homogenisation of the world's fauna and flora and the loss of biodiversity.&lt;ref name="Odendaal 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Odendaal | first1 = L.

Hybrids resulting from invasive species interbreeding with native species can incorporate their genotypes into the gene pool over time through introgression. Similarly, in some instances a small invading population can threaten much larger native populations. For example, ''Spartina alterniflora'' was introduced in the San Francisco Bay and hybridized with native ''Spartina foliosa.'' The higher pollen count and male fitness of the invading species resulted in [[introgression]] that threatened the native populations due to lower pollen counts and lower viability of the native species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12469817|title=Anttila CK, King RA, Ferris C, Ayres DR, Strong DR.

== Invasive exotic diseases ==
History is rife with the spread of exotic diseases, such as the introduction of [[smallpox]] into the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] by the Spanish, where it obliterated entire [[Population history of indigenous peoples of the Americas|populations of indigenous civilizations]] before they were ever even seen by Europeans.

Problematic exotic disease introductions in the past century or so include the [[chestnut blight]] which has almost eliminated the [[American chestnut]] tree from its forest habitat.  Responses to increase the population of the American chestnut include creating blight resistant trees that can be reintroduced. This displays both the positive and negative aspects of introduced species.

Another example is the [[Dutch elm disease]], which has severely reduced the [[American elm]] trees in forests and cities.

Diseases may also be vectored by invasive insects such as the [[Diaphorina citri|Asian citrus psyllid]] and the bacterial disease [[Citrus greening disease|citrus greening]].&lt;ref&gt;2013. "Pest Alert: Citrus Greening." Clemson University Invasive Species Program. http://www.clemson.edu/public/regulatory/plant_industry/invasive_exotic_programs/Pest%20Alerts/citrus_greening.html. Accessed 24 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

But in recent years some argue that some introduced species may have a positive ecological impact on an environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/02/110211095555.htm|title=Invasive plants can create positive ecological change|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the study of invasive species can be done within many subfields of biology, the majority of research on invasive organisms has been within the field of [[ecology]] and [[geography]] where the issue of biological invasions is especially important. Much of the study of invasive species has been influenced by [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton's]] 1958 book ''The Ecology of Invasion by Animals and Plants'' which drew upon the limited amount of research done within disparate fields to create a generalized picture of biological invasions.&lt;ref name=IE&gt;{{cite book|last=Lockwood|first=Julie L.|title=Invasion Ecology|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|page=7|url=http://www.planta.cn/forum/files_planta/invasion_ecology1_208.pdf|author2=Martha F. Hoopes |author3=Michael P. Marchetti |accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lowry&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23404636|year=2012|last1=Lowry|first1=E|last2=Rollinson|first2=EJ|last3=Laybourn|first3=AJ|last4=Scott|first4=TE|last5=Aiello-Lammens|first5=ME|last6=Gray|first6=SM|last7=Mickley|first7=J|last8=Gurevitch|first8=J|title=Biological invasions: A field synopsis, systematic review, and database of the literature|volume=3|issue=1|pages=182–96|doi=10.1002/ece3.431|pmc=3568853|journal=Ecology and Evolution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies on invasive species remained sparse until the 1990s when research in the field experienced a large amount of growth which continues to this day.&lt;ref name=Lowry/&gt; This research, which has largely consisted of field observational studies, has disproportionately been concerned with [[terrestrial plant]]s.&lt;ref name=Lowry/&gt; The rapid growth of the field has driven a need to standardize the language used to describe invasive species and events. Despite this, little standard terminology exists within the study of invasive species which itself lacks any official designation but is commonly referred to as "Invasion ecology" or more generally "Invasion biology".&lt;ref name=IE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lowry/&gt; This lack of standard terminology is a significant problem, and has largely arisen due to the interdisciplinary nature of the field which borrows terms from numerous disciplines such as agriculture, zoology, and pathology, as well as due to studies on invasive species being commonly performed in isolation of one another.&lt;ref name=IE/&gt;

In an attempt to avoid the ambiguous, subjective, and pejorative vocabulary that so often accompanies discussion of invasive species even in scientific papers, Colautti and MacIsaac proposed a new nomenclature system based on [[biogeography]] rather than on [[taxa]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite journal| last=Colautti| first=Robert I. |author2=Hugh J. MacIsaac |title=A neutral terminology to define 'invasive' species| journal=Diversity and Distributions| year=2004 |url=http://planet.botany.uwc.ac.za/nisl/Invasives/Assignment1/ColauttiandMacIsaac.pdf| volume=10 |pages=135–141 |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-09-01 |doi=10.1111/j.1366-9516.2004.00061.x| issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By discarding taxonomy, human health, and economic factors, this model focused only on ecological factors. The model evaluated individual populations rather than entire species. It classified each population based on its success in that environment. This model applied equally to indigenous and to introduced species, and did not automatically categorize successful introductions as harmful.

=== Introduced species on islands ===
Perhaps the best place to study problems associated with introduced species is on islands. Depending upon the isolation (how far an island is located from continental biotas), native island biological communities may be poorly adapted to the threat posed by exotic introductions. Often this can mean that no natural [[predator]] of an introduced species is present, and the non-native spreads uncontrollably into open or occupied [[ecological niche|niche]].

An additional problem is that birds native to small islands may have become flightless because of the absence of predators prior to introductions and cannot readily escape the danger brought to them by introduced predators. The tendency of [[rail (bird)|rail]]s in particular to evolve flightless forms on islands making them vulnerable  has led to the disproportionate number of extinctions in that family.

The field of [[island restoration]] has developed as a field of [[conservation biology]] and [[ecological restoration]], a large part of which deals with the eradication of invasive species.

==== New Zealand ====
{{Main|Invasive species in New Zealand}}
In [[New Zealand]] the largest commercial crop is ''[[Pinus radiata]]'', the [[California native plants|native Californian]] Monterey pine tree, which grows as well in New Zealand as in [[California]]. However, the pine forests are also occupied by [[deer]] from [[North America]] and [[Europe]]. They are exotic species and have thrived in the New Zealand environment. The pines are seen as beneficial while the deer are regarded as serious pests.

Common [[gorse]], originally a hedge plant in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], was introduced to New Zealand for the same purpose. Like the Monterey pine, it has shown a favour to its new climate. It is, however, regarded as a noxious plant that threatens to obliterate native plants in much of the country and is hence routinely eradicated, though it can also provide a nursery environment for native plants to reestablish themselves.

[[Rabbit]]s, introduced as a food source by sailors in the 1800s, have become a severe nuisance to farmers, notably in the South Island. The [[myxomatosis]] [[virus]] was illegally imported and illegally released, but it had little lasting effect upon the rabbit population other than to make it more resistant to the virus.

Cats, brought later by Europeans, have had a devastating effect upon the native birdlife, particularly as many New Zealand birds are flightless. Feral cats and dogs which were originally brought as pets are also known to kill large numbers of birds. A recent (2006) study in the South Island has shown that even domestic cats with a ready supply of food from their owners may kill hundreds of birds in a year, including natives.

[[Sparrows]], which were brought to control insects upon the introduced [[grain]] crops, have displaced native birds as have [[rainbow lorikeet]]s and [[cockatoos]] (both from Australia) which fly free around areas west of [[Auckland]] City such as the [[Waitakere Ranges]].

In much of New Zealand, the Australian [[black swan]] has effectively eliminated the existence of the previously introduced [[mute swan]].

Two notable varieties of spiders have also been introduced: the [[white tail spider]] and the [[redback spider]]. Both may have arrived inside shipments of fruit. Until then,  the only spider (and the only venomous animal) dangerous to humans was the native [[katipo]], which is very similar to the redback and  interbreed with the more aggressive Australian variety.

==== South Georgia Island ====

In 2018, the [[South Georgia Island]] was declared free of invasive [[rodent]]s after a multi-year extermination effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/05/rat-begone-record-eradication-effort-rids-sub-antarctic-island-invasive-rodents|title=Rat begone: Record eradication effort rids sub-Antarctic island of invasive rodents|last=Warren|first=Matt|date=2018-05-08|work=Science|access-date=2018-05-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-to-exterminate-rats-on-an-island&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jack M. Sasson''', now retired, taught most recently as Mary Jane Werthan Professor of [[Jewish Studies]] and [[Hebrew Bible]] at [[Vanderbilt Divinity School]] and before that as a Professor of [[Classics]] at [[Vanderbilt University]].&lt;ref name="faculty"&gt;[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/divinity/facultypages/jsasson.php Vanderbilt Divinity School Faculty Pages]&lt;/ref&gt;  His research focuses primarily on [[Assyriology]] and [[Hebrew Scriptures]], writing on the archives from eighteenth century BCE found at [[Mari, Syria]], by the [[Euphrates]], near the modern-day Syria-Iraq border as well as on [[biblical studies]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Aleppo, Syria]], on October 1, 1941, Sasson immigrated to the [[United States]] in 1955 after a significant stay in [[Lebanon]] where he attended the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] schools.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web |author=Lew Harris |date=28 August 2000 |title=Syrian-born divinity professor discovers America as the land of opportunity |work=Vanderbilt Register |url=https://news.vanderbilt.edu/archived-news/register/articles/index-id=4369.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In America, Sasson enrolled in [[Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn, New York)|Abraham Lincoln High School]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]], and then [[Brooklyn College]], which later became a constituent school of the [[City University of New York]] college system.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; He received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in history in 1962 from [[Brooklyn College]].&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

Immediately after completing his undergraduate education, Sasson accepted a scholarship to pursue his graduate studies at [[Brandeis University]]. At Brandeis, he focused first on [[Islamic Studies]], earning an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in Mediterranean Studies in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in Biblical Studies and Archaeology'', 2nd ed., 1993, 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, however, he earned his doctorate in [[Ancient Near Eastern]] Studies in 1966, writing his dissertation under [[Cyrus Gordon]].&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

Sasson taught at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], moving up the rank and becoming a full professor of Religious Studies in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Klebba, Caryn E. ''Directory of American Scholars 2002''. 10th ed., vol. 4, 437.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Sasson was appointed to the prestigious [[William R. Kenan Chair]] in Religious Studies where he remained until joining the faculty of [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

Sasson was president of the [[American Oriental Society]] from 1996 to 1997 and of the [http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/IAA/ International Association for Assyriology] from 2005 to 2009.&lt;ref name="faculty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;[http://people.vanderbilt.edu/~jack.m.sasson/curriculum_vitae.htm Jack M.

The '''Lalemand Behaviour Scale''' is a [[secondary prevention|secondary prevention strategy]] used to recognise and diffuse episodes of [[challenging behaviour]]. The Scale is a dynamic tool that provides healthcare employees with a quick method to assess five different levels of behaviour, recognise the second level message associated to that behaviour, and identify appropriate management strategies.

==History==
Developed in 1977, by American [[Kurk Lalemand]], the scale is a practice-based tool used by healthcare employees in America, Canada and the United Kingdom (UK). The Lalemand Behaviour Scale is a core component of the [[Non-Abusive Psychological and Physical Intervention]] (NAPPI) training programme. NAPPI training is accredited with the [[British Institute of Learning Disabilities]] (BILD), under the [[Physical Intervention Accreditation Scheme]] (PIAS).

The Scale is extremely versatile, delivered as part of a full programme, or as a stand-alone tool to employees in a variety of settings, e.g. residential care, domiciliary agencies and schools. Service users can also benefit by using the tool to communicate a preferred strategy to manage their episodes of challenging behaviour and (if required) consent to [[Restrictive Physical Intervention]] (RPI).

In 2009–2010, over 10,000 healthcare and school employees were taught this tool within the UK.

==Description==
The Lalemand Behaviour Scale is a dynamic tool that is not intended to label or diagnose, nor is it intended to be a precise, scientific instrument. It provides a relatively objective method to assess an individual's behaviour when it becomes challenging. This enables employees to respond in an appropriate manner that will make everyone safer.

The scale is a secondary prevention strategy used to gauge the effectiveness of an employee's management of an individual's challenging behaviour. Effective management will stop the challenging behaviour escalating and result in de-escalation. At times employees have to respond to [[self-injurious behaviour]] (SIB), which requires a response that is neither too intrusive, e.g. restraining an individual who is being uncooperative, nor too indecisive, e.g. failing to set limits for a person who is being destructive. Employees need a method to match their response to the level of behaviour that they observe.

==Language==
One of the problems that employees face when working with people who are challenging, is how to describe behaviour. Euphemisms such as, "kicking off" or "losing it" are frequently used. Such imprecise language can cause problems as employees do not communicate clearly to each other, supervisors or other professionals. The result is an overall lack of consistency in documentation and reporting of incidents. The Lalemand Behaviour Scale provides employees with a more objective language.

'''Language acquisition by deaf children''' parallels the development of any children acquiring spoken language as long as there is full access to language from birth.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Despite limited access to spoken language, communication and language exposure are fundamental to deaf infants' general cognitive development and their engagement with their surroundings. While a growing number of deaf children in the developed world receive hearing aids and/or cochlear implants to support spoken language acquisition&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bradham|first1=Tamala|last2=Jones|first2=Julibeth|title=Cochlear implant candidacy in the United States: Prevalence in children 12 months to 6 years of age|journal=International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology|date=July 2008|volume=72|issue=7|pages=1023–1028|doi=10.1016/j.ijporl.2008.03.005|pmid=18433884|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165587608001274|accessdate=27 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; there are Deaf communities around the world that use signed languages.

== Early stages (birth to 12 months) ==
The general stages of [[language acquisition]] are the same whether the language is spoken or signed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sign language : An international handbook|last=Pfau|first=Roland|last2=Steinbach|first2=Markus|last3=Woll|first3=Bencie|publisher=De Gruyter Mouton|others=|year=2012|isbn=9783110204216|location=Berlin|pages=647|oclc=812574063}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are certain unique features of sign language acquisition due to the visual/manual [[Modality (semiotics)|modality]] and these differences can help to distinguish between universal aspects of language acquisition and aspects that may be affected by early experience.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The very earliest linguistic tasks facing newborns are perceptual.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; Babies need to determine what basic linguistic elements are used in their native language to create words (their [[Phonetics|phonetic]] inventory).

== Methods ==
=== Pedagogy ===

Language acquisition strategies for signing deaf children are different than those appropriate for hearing children, or for deaf children who successfully use hearing aids and/or cochlear implants. For parents with deaf children who do not use amplification (hearing aids or cochlear implants), [[joint attention]] (an important component to language development) can be problematic. Hearing children can watch their environment and listen to an adult comment on it. However, children who do not hear have to switch their visual attention back and forth between stimuli. 

Strategies for nonverbal communication include using facial expressions and body language to show emotion and reinforce the child's attention to their caregiver. To attract and direct a deaf child's attention, caregivers can break his line of gaze using hand and body movements, touch, and pointing to allow language input. In order to make language salient,{{clarify|reason=salient language?|date=February 2018}} parents should use short, simple sentences so that the child's attention doesn’t have to be divided for too long. Finally, to reduce the need for divided attention, a caregiver can position themselves and objects within the child's visual field so that language and the object can be seen at the same time.

=== Speech and oral methods ===

For deaf children who use listening and spoken language as their primary mode of communication, their families will often participate in [[Auditory-verbal therapy]], a means of enhancing the innate language and listening skills of deaf children. Most children who receive appropriate amplification before the age of 18 months and receive appropriate auditory-verbal instruction will follow language-learning trajectories of their peers who have typical hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Niparko |first1=John |author1link=John Niparko |last2=Tobey |first2=Emily |last3=Thal |first3=Donna |title=Spoken Language Development in Children Following Cochlear Implantation |journal=JAMA |date=April 21, 2010 |volume=303 |issue=15 |pages=1498–1506 |doi=10.1001/jama.2010.451|pmid=20407059 |pmc=3073449 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Signing and manual methods ===

==== ASL (American sign language) ====

[[ASL]] employs signs made by moving one's hands along with one's facial expressions and body language. Some studies indicate that if a deaf child learns sign language, he or she will be less likely to learn spoken languages because they will lose motivation.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} However, Humphries insists that there is no evidence for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humphries|first=Tom|last2=Kushalnagar|first2=Poorna|last3=Mathur|first3=Gaurav|last4=Napoli|first4=Donna Jo|last5=Padden|first5=Carol|last6=Rathmann|first6=Christian|last7=Smith|first7=Scott R.|date=2012-01-01|title=Language acquisition for deaf children: Reducing the harms of zero tolerance to the use of alternative approaches|journal=Harm Reduction Journal|volume=9|pages=16|doi=10.1186/1477-7517-9-16|issn=1477-7517|pmc=3384464|pmid=22472091}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Manually coded English ====

[[Manually coded English]] is any one of a number of different representations of the English language that uses manual signs to encode English words visually. Although MCE uses signs, it is not a language like ASL; it is an [[encoding]] of English that uses hand gestures to make English visible in a visual mode. Most types of MCE use signs borrowed or adapted from American Sign Language, but use English sentence order and grammatical construction.

Numerous systems of manually encoded English have been proposed and used with greater or lesser success. 
Methods such as [[Signed English]], [[Signing Exact English]],&lt;ref name="Kong-2008"&gt;Kong, W. W., &amp; Ranganath, S. (2008). Signing exact english (see): Modeling and recognition. Pattern Recognition, 41(5), 1638-1652.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linguistics of Visual English]], and others use signs borrowed from ASL along with various grammatical marker signs, to indicate whole words, or meaning-bearing [[morphemes]] like ''-ed'' or ''-ing''.

Because MCE systems are encodings of English which follow English word order and sentence structure, it's possible to sign MCE and speak English at the same time.  This is a technique that is used in order to teach deaf children the structure of the English language not only through the sound and lip-reading patterns of spoken English, but also through manual patterns of signed English. Because of the close connection between the two, it is easier for hearing people to learn MCE than ASL.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==== Cued speech ====

[[Cued Speech]] is a hybrid, oral/manual system of communication used by some deaf or hard-of-hearing people. It is a technique that uses handshapes near the mouth ("cues") to represent phonemes that can be challenging for some deaf or hard-of-hearing people to distinguish from one another through speechreading ("lipreading") alone. It is designed to help receptive communicators to observe and fully understand the speaker.

Cued speech is not a signed language, and it does not have any signs in common with ASL. It is a kind of augmented speechreading, making speechreading much more accurate and accessible to deaf people. The handshapes by themselves have no meaning; they only have meaning as a cue in combination with a mouth shape, so that the mouth shape 'two lips together' plus one handshape might mean an 'M' sound, the same shape with a different cue might represent a 'B' sound, and with a third cue might represent a 'P' sound.

Some research shows a link between lack of phonological awareness and reading disorders, and indicate that teaching cued speech may be an aid to phonological awareness and literacy.&lt;ref name=Ostrander-1998&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.syr.edu/~clostran/literacy.html |dead-url=yes |title=The Relationship Between Phonological Coding And Reading Achievement In Deaf Children: Is Cued Speech A Special Case? |first1=Carolyn |last1=Ostrander |date=1998 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113162758/web.syr.edu/~clostran/literacy.html |archivedate=2007-11-13 |accessdate=2018-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fingerspelling ====

Another manual encoding system used by the deaf and which has been around for more than two centuries is [[fingerspelling]]. Fingerspelling is a system that encodes letters and not words or morphemes, so is not a manual encoding of English, but rather an encoding of the alphabet. As such, it is a method of spelling out words one letter at a time using 26 different handshapes. In the United States and many other countries, the letters are indicated on one hand&lt;ref&gt;Carmel, Simon (1982). ''International hand alphabet charts.'' [[National Association of the Deaf (United States)]]; 2nd edition. (June 1982). {{ISBN|0-9600886-2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and go back to the deaf school of the [[Abbe de l'Epee]] in Paris.  Since fingerspelling is connected to the alphabet and not to entire words, it can be used to spell out words in any language that uses the same alphabet; so it is not tied to any one language in particular, and to that extent, it is analogous to other letter-encodings, such as [[Morse code]], or [[Semaphore]].  The [[Rochester Method]] relies heavily on fingerspelling, but it is slow and has mostly fallen out of favor.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Hybrid methods ===

Hybrid methods use a mixture of aural/oral methods as well as some visible indicators such as hand shapes in order to communicate in the standard spoken language by making parts of it visible to those with hearing loss.{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}

=== Literacy ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}

==== Reading ====

According to Goldin-Meadow, reading requires two essential abilities: familiarity with a language and understanding the mapping between that language and the written word. However, reading is possible if deaf children learn ASL. Once they have acquired ASL, deaf children learn how to map between sign language and print so that they can learn English. Several techniques are used to help bridge the gap between ASL and spoken language or the "translation process" such as sandwiching and chaining.

Sandwiching consists of alternating between saying the word and signing it. Chaining consists of finger spelling a word, pointing to the spoken language version of the word and using pictorial support. Although chaining is not widely used, it creates an understanding between the visual spelling of a word and the sign language spelling of the word. This helps the child become bilingual in both ASL and spoken language.

The deaf child's social context is crucial for nurturing his or her capacity to read. Research shows that deaf children born to deaf parents are usually better readers than deaf children born to hearing parents.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} This is because deaf parents provide a strong social and emotional network and may immediately have access to the necessary resources for their child. Deaf parents already anticipate the needs of their child, having been through the same experience, as opposed to a hearing parent.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

== Cochlear implants==
A [[cochlear implant]] is placed surgically inside the cochlea, which is the part of the inner ear that converts sound to neural signals. There is much debate regarding the linguistic conditions under which deaf children acquire spoken language via cochlear implantation. Some studies have concluded that long-term use of sign language impedes the development of spoken language and reading ability in deaf and hard of hearing children, and that using sign language is not at all advantageous, and can be detrimental to language development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geers|first=A.

===Ethics and language acquisition===

Cochlear implants have been the subject of a heated debate between those that believe deaf children should receive the implants and those that do not. Members of the Deaf Community believe this is an important ethical problem. They strongly advocate that sign language is their first or native language just as any other spoken language is for a hearing person. They do not see deafness as a deficiency in any way, but rather a normal human trait amongst a variety of different ones. One issue on the ethical perspective of implantation is the possible side effects that may present themselves after surgery (the body may physically reject the implant; for some reason, there may not be any benefit, or very little gained; the internal component may need to be replaced causing the need for another surgery), even in some cases lessening listening capabilities, losing residual hearing or hearing sounds differently. While the surgery presents one positive solution, these side effects are not often taken into account but are significant and need to be afforded more attention. However, complications from cochlear implant surgery is a rare event, with some centers showing less than a three percent failure rate.{{cite web|url=https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/239926.php|title=Cochlear Implant Failure Rate Generally Low}}

== Relationship between language acquisition and other domains of development ==

=== Cognitive development ===
Early exposure to language facilitates language acquisition, regardless of whether or not that exposure is native or non-native, as well as many other domains of development, such as cognitive development, including executive functioning skills. Executive functioning skills are extremely important, as these are the skills that guide learning and behavior&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Matthew L.|last2=Eigsti|first2=Inge-Marie|last3=Bortfeld|first3=Heather|last4=Lillo-Martin|first4=Diane|date=2016-09-13|title=Auditory Deprivation Does Not Impair Executive Function, But Language Deprivation Might: Evidence From a Parent-Report Measure in Deaf Native Signing Children|url=https://academic.oup.com/jdsde/article/22/1/9/2744719|journal=Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education|language=en|volume=22|issue=1|pages=9–21|doi=10.1093/deafed/enw054|pmid=27624307|pmc=5189172|issn=1081-4159}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These skills include self-regulation, inhibition, emotional control, working memory, and planning and organization, which contribute to overall social, emotional and academic development for children. Early access to a language, such as sign language, from birth supports the development of these cognitive skills and abilities in Deaf and hard of hearing children, and supports their development in this area&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2003-12-01|title=Age constraints on first versus second language acquisition: Evidence for linguistic plasticity and epigenesis|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093934X03001378|journal=Brain and Language|language=en|volume=87|issue=3|pages=369–384|doi=10.1016/S0093-934X(03)00137-8|issn=0093-934X|last1=Mayberry|first1=Rachel I.|last2=Lock|first2=Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

However, late exposure to language and delayed language acquisition can inhibit or delay the cognitive development of deaf and hard of hearing children, and impact these skills. This late exposure to language, or lack thereof, can be defined as language deprivation (see [[Language deprivation in deaf and hard of hearing children]]). This experience is the result of a lack of exposure to natural human language, whether that be spoken or signed language, during the critical language period&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;. Approximately 90% of Deaf children are born to hearing parents, and 95% of those Deaf children experience language deprivation to some degree&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;. Language Deprivation has been found to impair deaf children’s cognitive development, specifically their executive functioning skills, and working memory, causing deficits in critical executive functioning skills and overall cognitive development.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marshall|first=Chloë|last2=Jones|first2=Anna|last3=Denmark|first3=Tanya|last4=Mason|first4=Kathryn|last5=Atkinson|first5=Joanna|last6=Botting|first6=Nicola|last7=Morgan|first7=Gary|date=2015|title=Deaf children's non-verbal working memory is impacted by their language experience|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|language=English|volume=6|pages=527|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00527|pmid=25999875|pmc=4419661|issn=1664-1078}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is not deafness that causes these deficits, but late language acquisition that influences the cognitive development and abilities of deaf people.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

=== Social-emotional development ===
&lt;p&gt;Having an acquired language means an individual has had full access to at least one spoken or signed language.Typically, if a person has had this full access to language and has been able to acquire it, then being able to enter into a realm of social and emotional becomes plausible. Being able to communicate using is critical for those still developing their social skills&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://watermark.silverchair.com/140.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAZ4wggGaBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGLMIIBhwIBADCCAYAGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMFh5pQJvI5m7dR_GxAgEQgIIBUQWnPtWmmWaPBeEiz0cUJNT8WZgv874iQ6cl-7oN1u8Ktoi4ri0FwtVMhiNbIFiEu7aR1pI_jcWOV6ZYOY55gnxEP0sk3npoEW_faTEwZtE3Gjsc9rHx5OWwUf6rjKwY7eZ4CeyyfNus6W-WQm93NtINR4pEV8GRPV3A3h2yfj0x-ifP4_PSjXOJ6Z_f-YOgP2wGMSZMeC-DqQ8msacRllYRbbF0sVeDJjg-Owxo-r2DdGtEc3UTPRAEftiOi1Psp-bpIcF-tlfyUtXOnUkOKH6YiIh2ba9Sly2SSmfCYal2oUZsVCpZ-qE67_3uUN5CrPmso9eCCCDKJqol9LvkU_9P_Lqib3R8sAErjQoetJk70-HfjrgDKd4idBF3NvrgTI1y6udZw187mJin7tRM4OJSMmF85OqfvBACkU179KmsMSX48QVP51b5GszvMPSOUX8|title=Parental Involvement in Deaf Children's Education Programs as a Predictor of Child's Language, Early Reading, and Social- Emotional Development|last=Calderon|first=Rosemary|date=2000|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There is also evidence to suggest that language acquisition can play a critical role in developing [[Theory of mind|Theory of Mind]], or developing the understanding of false beliefs in language&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schick|first=Brenda|last2=de Villiers|first2=Peter|last3=de Villiers|first3=Jill|last4=Hoffmeister|first4=Robert|date=2007-03|title=Language and Theory of Mind: A Study of Deaf Children|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=78|issue=2|pages=376–396|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01004.x|pmid=17381779|issn=0009-3920|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.8685}}&lt;/ref&gt;. For children who have been deprived of this access or have not yet fully acquired a language, social development can be hindered, which in turn can affect one’s emotional development as well.&lt;/p&gt;The lack of socialization can significantly impact a child’s emotional well-being. A child’s first experience with social communication typically begins at home, but deaf and hard of hearing children in particular who are born to hearing parents tend to struggle with this interaction, due to the fact that they are a “minority in their own family"&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ME5q-42NojgC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=social+emotional+development+%22deaf+children%22,+Moores,+2001#v=onepage&amp;q=social%20emotional%20development%20%22deaf%20children%22,%20Moores,%202001&amp;f=false|title=Oxford Handbook of Deaf Studies, Language, and Education|last=NEWSOM|first=CAROL|last2=Newsom|first2=Professor of Old Testament Carol A.|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195149975|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Parents who have a Deaf child typically do not know a signed language, the logistical problem can become how to give that child a full language. If deaf and hard of hearing children are not developing their social skills at home, by the time they enter school, they can be behind in this development. All of this can lead to struggles with proper emotional development. It can be hard on a child who was not given a language early to try and express their emotions appropriately. The problem is not with the deaf child, but instead, not giving a deaf or hard of hearing child the necessary language access from birth that other children receive&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ME5q-42NojgC&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=emotional+deaf+children+#v=onepage&amp;q=emotional%20deaf%20children&amp;f=false|title=Oxford Handbook of Deaf Studies, Language, and Education|last=NEWSOM|first=CAROL|last2=Newsom|first2=Professor of Old Testament Carol A.|date=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195149975|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There are theories to suggest that language acquisition is a predictor of how a child can develop Theory of Mind and without a full language, this skill becomes null. Theory of Mind can be an indicator of social and cognitive development. Without language acquisition, Deaf children can become behind in Theory of Mind and the skills that coincide, which can lead to further social and emotional delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schick|first=Brenda|last2=de Villiers|first2=Peter|last3=de Villiers|first3=Jill|last4=Hoffmeister|first4=Robert|date=2007-03|title=Language and Theory of Mind: A Study of Deaf Children|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=78|issue=2|pages=376–396|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01004.x|pmid=17381779|issn=0009-3920|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.8685}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic development ===
Second language acquisition is also highly affected by early language exposure&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kroll et al.|date=2015|title=Bilingualism, Mind, and Brain|url=|journal=Annual Review of Linguistics|volume=1|pages=377–394|via=Annual Reviews|pmid=28642932|pmc=5478196|doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-124937}}&lt;/ref&gt;. More exposure in an accessible language leads to better performance in the second language upon entering school&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Providing deaf and hard of hearing children with the most language exposure possible from birth promotes both first and second language acquisition. This means giving students the opportunity to develop language at home and in social environments early on supports the child's language acquisition in American Sign Language as well as printed English&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;. There is extensive research regarding the correlation between proficiency in ASL and proficiency in English literacy skills&lt;ref name=":42"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cummins|first=Jim|date=2006|title=The Relationship between American Sign Language Proficiency and English Academic Development: A Review of the Research|url=|journal=Research Gate|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.{{Verify source|date=May 2018}}. Deaf students with higher ASL proficiency tend to have higher English reading and writing scores&lt;ref name=":42" /&gt;. There is also research to support that the development of a second language also improves proficiency in the student's first language&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

According to Hrastinski &amp; [[Ronnie Wilbur|Wilbur]] (2016), American Sign Language proficiency is the single most contributing factor to Deaf student’s academic achievement, particularly in reading literacy and math.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://watermark.silverchair.com/env072.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAaMwggGfBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggGQMIIBjAIBADCCAYUGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMS3camrsCwizIKhRSAgEQgIIBVpFuCm23QV_wHVAF3qVgbdg62eoEq1JZsJzomxbO32RncjGo5NWdeLlsU9FuynA2gSKh0AmiGnxZbZZTlHY_7pXQ-hiftLjL9eDTOfd3ZjUbfJmfcS15UDVJ1MTCiBrZukQfXeLsILvWEB4vfub0AoAbauMv9_DJI_g_gwToj0mPihM_xeoxSZ8-ol7ZoHV8nHQ_2B88eVr-zbdCzQvcPSfuAFVi-6a1o_G0R1AFAXIdoCpkobHaTGZNZpWS2LYyjZu6ROohCwka4zTyQm3bZUH4cavd5Eex0uGq67odjR3Q3wWsUB2KnmIfYC0ZBBRhBZl0UDp7glaYAeXhKXQVAm4HsR5VdFOAVUCKF-c9zY_wLIX07ANiGjyQJRBbDYl8gs0Bau5w4oD77V_WYsbZZcbJedA2IjGAVtcZUmBJioWxxHKSeEbIZAdBpwfmLGUkgl-GTlbmUw|title=Academic Achievement of Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Students in an ASL/English Bilingual Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Deaf and hard of hearing children who have higher levels of American Sign Language proficiency and those who have higher proficiency in a second language (e.g., English) are those who were exposed to American Sign Language during the critical period of language.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The [[ecclesiastical]] words most commonly [[abbreviate]]d at all times are [[proper name]]s, [[title]]s (official or customary), of persons or [[corporation]]s, and words of frequent occurrence. A list of those used in [[Roman Republic]]an and early [[Roman Empire|Imperial]] times may be seen in [[James Chidester Egbert, Jr.]]'s ''[[Latin Inscriptions]]'' ([[New York City]], 1896), 417–459.

The [[Jewish]] scribes and [[Talmudic]] scholars also had frequent recourse to abbreviations. Between the seventh and ninth centuries the ancient [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] system of abbreviations gave way to a more difficult one that gradually grew up in the monastic houses and in the chanceries of the new [[Germanic peoples|Teutonic]] kingdoms. [[Merovingian]], [[Lombardic language|Lombard]], and [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] scripts offer each their own abbreviations, not to speak of the unique scotica manus or libri scottice scripti ([[Irish language|Irish]] hand, or books written in the medieval Irish hand). Eventually such productive centres of technical manuscripts as the [[Papal Chancery]], the theological schools of [[Paris]] and [[Oxford]], and the civil-law school of [[Bologna]] set the standards of abbreviations for all [[Europe]].

Medieval manuscripts abound in abbreviations, owing in part to the abandonment of the [[uncial]], or [[quasi]]-uncial, and the almost universal use of the cursive, hand. The medieval writer inherited a few from [[Christian]] antiquity; others he invented or adapted, in order to save time and parchment. They are found especially in manuscripts of scholastic theology and canon law, annals and chronicles, the Roman law, and in administrative documents, civil and privileges, bulls, rescripts. They multiplied with time, and were never so numerous as on the eve of the discovery of printing; many of the early printed books offer this peculiarity, together with other characteristics of the manuscript page.

The development of printing brought about the abandonment of many abbreviations, while it suggested and introduced new ones a process also favoured by the growth of ecclesiastical legislation, the creation of new offices, etc. There was less medieval abbreviation in the text of books much used on public occasions, e.g. missals, antiphonaries, Bibles; in one way or another the needs of students seem to have been the chief cause of the majority of medieval abbreviations. The means of abbreviation were usually full points or dots (mostly in Roman antiquity), the semicolon (eventually conventionalized), lines (horizontal, perpendicular, oblong, wavy curves, and commas). Vowel-sounds were frequently written not after, but over, the consonants. Certain letters, like p and q, that occur with extreme. frequency, e.g. in prepositions and terminations, became the source of many peculiar abbreviations; similarly, frequently recurring words like et (and), est (is). Habit and convenience are today the principal motives for using abbreviations. Most of those in actual use fall under one or other of the following heads: [[Administration (business)|Administrative]], [[Liturgical]], [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]], and [[Chronological]].

==Administrative==
The first class of abbreviations includes those used in the composition of [[Pontifical]] documents. They were once very numerous, and lists of them may be seen in the works quoted below (e.g. [[Quantin]], [[Prou]]). It may be well to state at once that since 29 December 1878, by order of [[Leo&amp;nbsp;XIII]], the great papal documents ([[Litterae Apostolicae]]) are no longer written in the old [[goths|Gothic]] hand known as bollatico; all abbreviations, with the exception of a few obvious ones, like S.R.E., were abolished by the same authority ([[Acta Sanctae Sedis]], XI, 465–467). In the transaction of ordinary business the [[Roman Congregations]] are wont to use certain brief and pithy formulas (e.g. Negative = "[[Yes and no|No]]"; Negative et amplius = "No with emphasis"). They are not, correctly speaking, abbreviations. For a list of these see [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|Canon law]]. This class includes also the abbreviations for the names of most sees. The full [[Latin]] titles of all existing (Latin) dioceses may be seen in the Roman annual, "[[Gerarchia Cattolica]]", a complete list of the Latin names of all known dioceses (extant or extinct) is found in the large folio work of the [[Count|Comte]] de [[Mas Latrie]], "Trésor de chronologie, d'histoire et de géographie" (Paris, 1884). For the same purpose the reader may also consult the episcopal catalogues of the [[Benedictine]] [[Pius Bonifacius Gams]], "[[Series Episcoporum Ecclesiae Catholicae]]" ([[Ratisbon]], 1873–86), and the [[Franciscan]] [[Conrad Eubel]], ''[[Hierarchia Catholica Medii Ævi]]'' ([[Münster]], 1898–1902). Under this general heading may be included all abbreviated forms of addresses in ordinary intercourse, whether of individuals or of members of religious orders, congregations, institutes, to which may be added the forms of addresses usual for members of [[Catholic]] lay societies and the [[Papal]] orders of merit. (See [[Catholic societies]], [[orders of merit]].) The abbreviations of the titles of [[Roman Congregations]], and of the individual canonical ecclesiastical authorities, belong also to this class.

==Liturgical==
A second class of abbreviations includes those used in the description of [[liturgical]] acts or the directions for their performance, e.g. the [[Holy Mass]], the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] ([[Breviary]]), the ecclesiastical devotions, etc. Here may also be classed the abbreviated forms for the name of [[God]], [[Jesus Christ]], and the [[Holy Ghost]]; also for the names of the [[Blessed Virgin]], the saints, etc.; likewise abbreviations used in the administration of the [[Sacraments]], mortuary epitaphs, etc. (to which class belong the numerous [[Catacomb]] inscriptions); finally some miscellaneous abbreviations like those used in the publication of documents concerning beatification and canonization.

==Scholastic==
In the third class belong scholastic abbreviations, used to designate honorific titles acquired in the schools, to avoid the repetition of lengthy titles of books and reviews, or to facilitate reference to ecclesiastical and civil legislation.

==Chronological==
In the fourth class of abbreviations belong all such as are used to describe the elements of the year, civil or ecclesiastical.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6169">'''Medical Missions for Children''' is an independent, non-profit organization that works to improve health outcomes for our world's most critically ill children by providing individual [[telemedicine]] consultations and implementing education programs focused on narrowing the knowledge gap between healthcare providers in the United States and those in the developing world.  MMC focuses on "transferring medical knowledge from those who have it to those who need it" using a state-of-the-art communications infrastructure in order to touch the lives of more than one million critically ill children each year.

==About==
Medical Missions for Children was founded in 1999 by Frank and Peg Brady.  Its Global Telemedicine and Teaching Network - GTTN - currently serves over 100 countries throughout Latin America/Caribbean, Africa, North America, Asia/Pacific, Eastern Europe/Central Asia and the Middle East.

MMC is located on the campus of [[St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center]] in [[Paterson, New Jersey]]. It is a major stakeholder in [[List of tallest buildings in Paterson|The Hamiltonian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Hamiltonian |publisher=Garret Mountain Associates |date= |url=http://www.gmanj.com/home.html |accessdate=2014-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141121171821/http://www.gmanj.com/home.html |archivedate=2014-11-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a 14-story hotel and conference center projected to open in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | title = Medical Missions for Children Hilton Doubletree   | publisher = Emporis   | date =    | url = http://www.emporis.com/building/medical-missions-for-children-hilton-doubletree-paterson-nj-usa   | accessdate = 2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web      | last = Prochilo   | first = Dan   | title = Developer predicts $150M Paterson hotel will be 'very, very busy'   | publisher = Emporis   | date = August 11, 2014   | url = http://www.fios1news.com/newjersey/node/33976#.VIgKLt77-8U   | accessdate = 2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   | last = Ma   | first = Myles   | title = $100 million Paterson hotel to break ground in October   | publisher = The Star-Ledger   | date = August 7, 2014   | url = http://www.nj.com/passaic-county/index.ssf/2014/08/100_million_paterson_hotel_to_break_ground_in_october.html   | accessdate = 2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Malinconico   | first = Joe   | title = Paterson hotel project at hospital gets $105 million in state funding   | publisher = NorthJersey.com   | date = December 10, 2013   | url = http://www.northjersey.com/news/paterson-hotel-project-at-hospital-gets-105-million-in-state-funding-1.653635   | accessdate = 2014-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Global Telemedicine and Teaching Network==
The Global Telemedicine and Teaching Network (GTTN) comprises several programs:
*The Medical Broadcasting Channel - A 24/7/365 channel airing medical programming via satellite broadcast, [[Internet2]], and IPTV Networks.
*The Telemedicine Outreach Program -  a network of 27 tier-one mentoring hospitals in the United States and Europe linking to hospitals and institutions in more than 100 countries.

This Medical Missions for Children/Paterson, NJ (MMC) should not be confused with Medical Missions for Children (MMFC), a 501(3)(c) charity based in Woburn, MA that sends 13-15 surgical, medical and dental missions around the world each year to care for impoverished children who suffer from cleft deformities, microtia (absence of ear), head and neck abnormalities and severe, untreated burn injuries

==Television Programs==
MMC currently produces four healthcare series, several of which have been broadcast on the [[New Jersey Network]], the predecessor to NJTV, New Jersey's affiliate of [[PBS]].

==The ''Giggles'' Children's Theater==
Located at St. Joseph's Children's Hospital, the ''Giggles'' Children's Theater (''Giggles'') draws its curtains twice each week to bring the healing powers of laughter through the performing arts to hospitalized children in Paterson.  Each performance is broadcast live on the hospital's closed-circuit TV system so that no child is excluded due to sickness or incapacity. Each performance is also recorded and rebroadcast so that 10 shows per week are offered on the hospital's Giggles TV channel.

In April 2007 a second ''Giggles'' theater opened at The Children's Inn located at the campus of the [[National Institutes of Health]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22123">[[Music]] has been used in [[psychological operations]]. The term '''music torture''' is sometimes used by critics of the practice of playing [[loud music]] incessantly to prisoners or people besieged.

The [[United Nations]] and the [[European Court of Human Rights]] have banned the use of loud music in [[interrogation]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The term [[torture]] is sometimes used to describe the practice. While it is acknowledged by US interrogation experts that it causes discomfort, it has also been characterized by them as causing no "long-term effects".&lt;ref name=BbcMusicTorture20030523&gt;

Music and sound have been usually used as part of a combination of interrogation methods, today recognized by international bodies as amounting to torture.&lt;ref&gt;UN Committee Against Torture 1997 "Concluding observations: Israel. 09/05/1997."  {{cite web |url=http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/1B3ED23212DCBE3B05256547005C47FA |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728224401/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/1B3ED23212DCBE3B05256547005C47FA |archivedate=2014-07-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attacking all senses without leaving any visible traces, they have formed the basis of the widely discussed torture in [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo]] and [[Abu Ghraib prison|Abu Ghraib]]. They were, however, devised much earlier in the 1950s and early 1960s, as a way to counter so-called Soviet "brainwashing".&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Alfred W (2006). ''A Question of Torture.

"Detainees have reported being routinely subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment during arrest and detention. Many have told Amnesty International that they were tortured and ill-treated by US and UK troops during interrogation. Methods often reported include prolonged sleep deprivation; beatings; prolonged restraint in painful positions, sometimes combined with exposure to loud music; prolonged hooding; and exposure to bright lights. Virtually none of the allegations of torture or ill-treatment has been adequately investigated by the authorities."

=== [[Greece]] ===
According to recent research, the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74|Greek military Junta]] (1967–1974) used the above-mentioned combination of interrogation techniques, including music. This took place in the headquarters of the Special Interrogation Unit of Greek Military Police (EAT/ESA), Athens. New interviews with survivors, held there in 1973, talk about the use of songs, popular hits of the time: these were played loudly and repeatedly from loudspeakers as the detainee had to stand without rest, food, drink or sleep.&lt;ref&gt;Papaeti Anna (2013). “Music, Torture, Testimony: Reopening the Case of the Greek Military Junta (1967–74).” the world of music (special issue): Music and Torture | Music and Punishment 2:1(2013), guest edited by M. J. Grant and Anna Papaeti, pp. 73–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==

In the book ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' by [[Anthony Burgess]] and the subsequent [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|film]] based upon it, a rebellious teenager is subjected to brutal experimental brain-washing techniques that cause him to feel physical pain if he has similar violent thoughts to those that sent him to jail in the first place; as an accidental side-effect, he has the same response if he hears [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]].  Later, a man tortures him by locking him in a room where the symphony is played loudly.

In ''[[Back to the Future]]'', Marty used music made by [[Van Halen]] to scare his dad, George McFly, awake, implying that since that kind of music did not exist in that time, it would scare him.

In ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', a helicopter squadron plays classical music, [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Ride of the Valkyries]]'', over loudspeakers on-board their helicopters while attacking a Viet Cong village, as a form of psychological warfare.

In [[Woody Allen]]'s early film ''[[Bananas (film)|Bananas]]'', a prisoner is tortured by being tied up in a room while operetta, featuring an annoying coluratora soprano, is played over and over on a cheap record-player. 

In ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', Mimi played "[[Panama (song)|Panama]]" by Van Halen repeatedly to drive Drew and friends from his house.

In an episode of the U.S. television show ''[[Burn Notice]]'' Sam Axe plays loud music to a prisoner to break his will.

In the film ''[[The Men Who Stare at Goats (film)|The Men Who Stare at Goats]]'', a take-off of the [[Barney &amp; Friends]] ending song "I Love You" is played in the cells of Iraqi detainees as a form of torture.

In the TV series ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'', [[Grindcore]] is used to keep a prisoner awake.

In ''Power Rangers Megaforce'', Emma sings a song to help the rangers defeat Dischord.

In the series 'Lost', [[drum and bass]] music is used to keep an islander's boyfriend awake and indoctrinated and tortured.

In one episode of 'The Flash' Cisco plays 'Never Gonna Give You Up' on repeat to Hartley get him to reveal information they need.

Public awareness of the use of this technique is widespread enough that it can be used in satirical attacks on popular culture:

Zero dB is an initiative against music torture set up by legal charity [[Reprieve (organisation)|Reprieve]], which represents over thirty prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. Zero dB aims to stop torture music by encouraging widespread condemnation of the practice and by calling on governments and the UN to uphold and enforce the Convention Against Torture and other relevant treaties. The initiative is backed by the Musicians Union which is calling on British musicians to voice their outrage against the use of music to torture.

Musicians and the wider public are making their own silent protests against music torture which are being shown on Zero dB. A series of silent protests and actions are planned through 2009. Participating musicians will include minutes of silence in their concerts to draw their audience's attention to the USA's use of deafening music against captives.

According to the ''Associated Press'' [[FBI]] agents stationed at Guantanamo Bay reported that the use of deafening music was common.&lt;ref name=AP2008-12-09/&gt;
According to the ''Associated Press''
Guantanamo Bay spokesmen [[Commander]] [[Pauline Storum]]:

|}

Among the musicians united in their objections were [[Christopher Cerf (musician and television producer)|Christopher Cerf]], a composer for the children's show [[Sesame Street]], and [[Tom Morello]]
of [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Audioslave]].&lt;ref name=AP2008-12-09/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27277">[[Nature]] has two inter-related meanings in [[philosophy]]. On the one hand, it means the set of all things which are natural, or subject to the normal working of the [[Physical law|laws of nature]]. On the other hand, it means the [[essence|essential properties]] and [[cause]]s of individual things.

How to understand the meaning and significance of nature has been a consistent theme of discussion within the history of [[Western Civilization]], in the [[philosophy|philosophical]] fields of [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]], as well as in [[theology]] and [[science]]. The study of natural things and the regular laws which seem to govern them, as opposed to discussion about what it means to be natural, is the area of [[natural science]].

The word "nature" derives from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:natura#Latin|nātūra]]'', a philosophical term derived from the verb for [[birth]], which was used as a translation for the earlier ([[pre-Socratic]]) [[ancient Greek|Greek]] term ''[[Physis|phusis]]'', derived from the verb for natural growth.
Already in classical times, philosophical use of these words combined two related meanings which have in common that they refer to the way in which things happen by themselves, "naturally", without "interference" from human deliberation, divine intervention, or anything outside what is considered normal for the natural things being considered.

Understandings of nature depend on the subject and age of the work where they appear. For example, [[Aristotle]]'s explanation of natural properties differs from what is meant by natural properties in modern philosophical and scientific works, which can also differ from other scientific and conventional usage.

==Classical nature and Aristotelian metaphysics==
{{main|Physis}}
The [[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]] (from ''ta phusika'' "the natural [things]") is [[Aristotle]]'s principal work on nature. In [[Physics (Aristotle)#Book II|Physics II]].1, Aristotle defines a nature  as "a source or cause of being moved and of being at rest in that to which it belongs primarily".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' 192b21&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, a nature is the principle within a natural raw material that is the source of tendencies to change or rest in a particular way unless stopped. For example, a rock would fall unless stopped. Natural things stand in contrast to artifacts, which are formed by human artifice, not because of an innate tendency. (The raw materials of a bed have no tendency to become a bed.) In terms of Aristotle's theory of [[four causes]], the word natural is applied both to the innate potential of matter cause and the forms which the matter tends to become naturally.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' 193b21&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Leo Strauss]],&lt;ref&gt;"Progress or Return" in An Introduction to Political Philosophy: Ten Essays by Leo Strauss. (Expanded version of Political Philosophy: Six Essays by Leo Strauss, 1975.) Ed. Hilail Gilden. Detroit: Wayne State UP, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; the beginning of Western philosophy involved the "discovery or invention of nature" and the "pre-philosophical equivalent of nature" was supplied by "such notions as 'custom' or 'ways'". In ancient Greek philosophy on the other hand, Nature or natures are ways that are "really universal" "in all times and places". What makes nature different is that it presupposes not only that not all customs and ways are equal, but also that one can "find one's bearings in the cosmos" "on the basis of inquiry" (not for example on the basis of traditions or religion). To put this "discovery or invention" into the traditional terminology, what is "by nature" is contrasted to what is "by convention". The concept of nature taken this far remains a strong tradition in modern western thinking. [[Science]], according to Strauss' commentary of Western history is the contemplation of nature, while [[technology]] was or is an attempt to imitate it.&lt;ref&gt;Strauss and Cropsey eds. History of Political Philosophy, Third edition, p.209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Going further, the philosophical concept of nature or natures as a special type of causation -  for example that the way particular humans are is partly caused by something called "human nature" is an essential step towards [[Aristotle]]'s teaching concerning [[Causality|causation]], which became standard in all Western philosophy until the arrival of modern science.
[[File:Aristotle.jpg|right|thumb|Aristotle]]
Whether it was intended or not, Aristotle's inquiries into this subject were long felt to have resolved the discussion about nature in favor of one solution. In this account, there are four different types of cause:
* The [[material cause]] is the "raw material" - the matter which undergoes change. One of the causes of a statue being what it is might be that it is bronze. All meanings of the word nature encompass this simple meaning.
* The [[efficient cause]] is the motion of another thing, which makes a thing change, for example a chisel hitting a rock causes a chip to break off. This is the way which the matter is forming into a form so that it become substance like what Aristotle said that a substance must have a form and matter in order to call it substance. This is the motion of changing a single being into two. This is the most obvious way in which cause and effect works, as in the descriptions of modern science. But according to Aristotle, this does not yet explain that of which the motion is, and we must "apply ourselves to the question whether there is any other cause per se besides matter".&lt;ref&gt;Metaphysics 995b, translated by Hugh Tredennick. Greek: μάλιστα δὲ ζητητέον καὶ πραγματευτέον πότερον ἔστι τι παρὰ τὴν ὕλην αἴτιον καθ᾽ αὑτὸ ἢ οὔ&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[formal cause]] is the form or idea which serves as a template towards which things develop - for example following an approach based upon Aristotle we could say that a child develops in a way partly determined by a thing called "human nature". Here, nature is a cause.
* The [[final cause]] is the aim towards which something is directed. For example, a human aims at something perceived to be good, as Aristotle says in the opening lines of the [[Nicomachean Ethics]].

The formal and final cause are an essential part of Aristotle's "[[Metaphysics]]" - his attempt to go beyond nature and explain nature itself. In practice they imply a human-like consciousness involved in the causation of all things, even things which are not man-made. Nature itself is attributed with having aims.&lt;ref&gt;As for example [[Aristotle Politics]] 1252b.1: "Thus the female and the slave are by nature distinct (for nature makes nothing as the cutlers make the Delphic knife, in a niggardly way, but one thing for one purpose; for so each tool will be turned out in the finest perfection, if it serves not many uses but one"&lt;/ref&gt;

The artificial, like the [[conventional]] therefore, is within this branch of Western thought, traditionally contrasted with the natural. [[Technology]] was contrasted with [[science]], as mentioned above. And another essential aspect to this understanding of causation was the distinction between the [[Accident (philosophy)|accidental]] properties of a thing and the [[Substance theory|substance]] - another distinction which has lost favor in the modern era, after having long been widely accepted in medieval Europe.

To describe it another way, Aristotle treated organisms and other natural wholes as existing at a higher level than mere matter in motion. Aristotle's argument for formal and final causes is related to a doctrine about how it is possible that people know things: "If nothing exists apart from individual things, nothing will be intelligible; everything will be sensible, and there will be no knowledge of anything—unless it be maintained that sense-perception is knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Metaphysics 999b, translated by Hugh Tredennick. Greek: εἰ μὲν οὖν μηδέν ἐστι παρὰ τὰ καθ᾽ ἕκαστα, οὐθὲν ἂν εἴη νοητὸν ἀλλὰ πάντα αἰσθητὰ καὶ ἐπιστήμη οὐδενός, εἰ μή τις εἶναι λέγει τὴν αἴσθησιν ἐπιστήμην.&lt;/ref&gt; Those philosophers who disagree with this reasoning therefore also see [[knowledge]] differently from Aristotle.

Aristotle then, described nature or natures as follows, in a way quite different from modern science...

{{Quotation|"'''Nature'''" means:&lt;br&gt; '''(a)''' in one sense, the genesis of growing things — as would be suggested by pronouncing the υ of '''φύσις'''&lt;ref&gt;''Phusis'' is the Greek word for Nature, and Aristotle is drawing attention to the similarity it has to the verb used to describe natural growth in a plant, ''phusei''. Indeed the first use of the word involves a plant: ὣς ἄρα φωνήσας πόρε φάρμακον ἀργεϊφόντης ἐκ γαίης ἐρύσας, καί μοι '''φύσιν''' αὐτοῦ ἔδειξε. "So saying, Argeiphontes [=Hermes] gave me the herb, drawing it from the ground, and showed me its nature." Odyssey 10.302-3 (ed. A.T. Murray).&lt;/ref&gt; long—and&lt;br&gt; '''(b)''' in another, that immanent thing from which a growing thing first begins to grow.&lt;br&gt; '''(c)''' The source from which the primary motion in every natural object is induced in that object as such. All things are said to grow which gain increase through something else by contact and organic unity (or adhesion, as in the case of embryos). Organic unity differs from contact; for in the latter case there need be nothing except contact, but in both the things which form an organic unity there is some one and the same thing which produces, instead of mere contact, a unity which is organic, continuous and quantitative (but not qualitative). Again, "nature" means &lt;br&gt;'''(d)''' the primary stuff, shapeless and unchangeable from its own potency, of which any natural object consists or from which it is produced; e.g., bronze is called the "nature" of a statue and of bronze articles, and wood that of wooden ones, and similarly in all other cases. For each article consists of these "natures," the primary material persisting. It is in this sense that men call the elements of natural objects the "nature," some calling it fire, others earth or air or water, others something else similar, others some of these, and others all of them. Again in another sense "nature" means&lt;br&gt; '''(e)''' the substance of natural objects; as in the case of those who say that the "nature" is the primary composition of a thing, or as [[Empedocles]] says: ''Of nothing that exists is there nature, but only mixture and separation of what has been mixed''; nature is but a name given to these by men. Hence as regards those things which exist or are produced by nature, although that from which they naturally are produced or exist is already present, we say that they have not their nature yet unless they have their form and shape. That which comprises both of these exists by nature; e.g. animals and their parts. And '''nature is both the primary matter''' (and this in two senses: either primary in relation to the thing, or primary in general; e.g., in bronze articles the primary matter in relation to those articles is bronze, but in general it is perhaps water—that is if all things which can be melted are water) '''and the form or essence''', i.e. the end of the process, of generation. Indeed from this sense of "nature," by an extension of meaning, every essence in general is called "nature," because the nature of anything is a kind of essence. From what has been said, then, the primary and proper sense of "nature" is the essence of those things which contain in themselves as such a source of motion; for the matter is called "nature" because it is capable of receiving the nature, and the processes of generation and growth are called "nature" because they are motions derived from it. And nature in this sense is the source of motion in natural objects, which is somehow inherent in them, either potentially or actually.|Metaphysics 1014b-1015a, translated by Hugh Tredennick, emphasis added.&lt;ref&gt;Greek, with emphasis added as a guide: '''φύσις''' λέγεται ἕνα μὲν τρόπον ἡ τῶν '''φυομένων''' γένεσις, οἷον εἴ τις ἐπεκτείνας λέγοι τὸ υ, ἕνα δὲ ἐξ οὗ '''φύεται''' πρώτου τὸ '''φυόμενον''' ἐνυπάρχοντος: ἔτι ὅθεν ἡ κίνησις ἡ πρώτη ἐν ἑκάστῳ τῶν '''φύσει''' ὄντων ἐν αὐτῷ ᾗ αὐτὸ  [20]  ὑπάρχει: '''φύεσθαι''' δὲ λέγεται ὅσα αὔξησιν ἔχει δι᾽ ἑτέρου τῷ ἅπτεσθαι καὶ συμπεφυκέναι ἢ προσπεφυκέναι ὥσπερ τὰ ἔμβρυα: διαφέρει δὲ σύμφυσις ἁφῆς, ἔνθα μὲν γὰρ οὐδὲν παρὰ τὴν ἁφὴν ἕτερον ἀνάγκη εἶναι, ἐν δὲ τοῖς συμπεφυκόσιν ἔστι τι ἓν τὸ αὐτὸ ἐν ἀμφοῖν ὃ ποιεῖ ἀντὶ τοῦ  [25]  ἅπτεσθαι συμπεφυκέναι καὶ εἶναι ἓν κατὰ τὸ συνεχὲς καὶ ποσόν, ἀλλὰ μὴ κατὰ τὸ ποιόν. ἔτι δὲ φύσις λέγεται ἐξ οὗ πρώτου ἢ ἔστιν ἢ γίγνεταί τι τῶν φύσει ὄντων, ἀρρυθμίστου ὄντος καὶ ἀμεταβλήτου ἐκ τῆς δυνάμεως τῆς αὑτοῦ, οἷον ἀνδριάντος καὶ τῶν σκευῶν τῶν χαλκῶν ὁ χαλκὸς ἡ  [30]  φύσις λέγεται, τῶν δὲ ξυλίνων ξύλον: ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἄλλων: ἐκ τούτων γάρ ἐστιν ἕκαστον διασωζομένης τῆς πρώτης ὕλης: τοῦτον γὰρ τὸν τρόπον καὶ τῶν φύσει ὄντων τὰ στοιχεῖά φασιν εἶναι φύσιν, οἱ μὲν πῦρ οἱ δὲ γῆν οἱ δ᾽ ἀέρα οἱ δ᾽ ὕδωρ οἱ δ᾽ ἄλλο τι τοιοῦτον λέγοντες, οἱ δ᾽  [35]  ἔνια τούτων οἱ δὲ πάντα ταῦτα. ἔτι δ᾽ ἄλλον τρόπον λέγεται ἡ φύσις ἡ τῶν φύσει ὄντων οὐσία, οἷον οἱ λέγοντες τὴν φύσιν εἶναι τὴν πρώτην σύνθεσιν, ἢ ὥσπερ Ἐμπεδοκλῆς λέγει ὅτι "φύσις οὐδενὸς ἔστιν ἐόντων, ἀλλὰ μόνον μῖξίς τε διάλλαξίς τε μιγέντων ἔστι, φύσις δ᾽ ἐπὶ τοῖς ὀνομάζεται ἀνθρώποισιν.

It has been argued, as will be explained below, that this type of theory represented an oversimplifying diversion from the debates within Classical philosophy, possibly even that Aristotle saw it as a simplification or summary of the debates himself. But in any case the theory of the four causes became a standard part of any advanced education in the [[Middle Ages]].

==Modern science and laws of nature: trying to avoid metaphysics==
[[File:Democritus by Agostino Carracci.jpg|thumb|right|A Renaissance imagined representation of Democritus, the laughing philosopher, by [[Agostino Carracci]]]]

In contrast, Modern Science took its distinctive turn with [[Francis Bacon]], who rejected the four distinct causes, and saw Aristotle as someone who "did proceed in such a spirit of difference and contradiction towards all antiquity: undertaking not only to frame new words of science at pleasure, but to confound and extinguish all ancient wisdom". He felt that lesser known Greek philosophers such as [[Democritus]] "who did not suppose a [[mind]] or [[reason]] in the frame of things", have been arrogantly dismissed because of Aristotelianism leading to a situation in his time wherein "the search of the physical causes hath been neglected, and passed in silence".&lt;ref&gt;Bacon ''[[Advancement of Learning]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/advancementlea00bacouoft#page/90/mode/2up/search/democritus II.VII.7] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531191702/http://www.archive.org/stream/advancementlea00bacouoft |date=2013-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

And so Bacon advised...

{{Quotation|Physic doth make inquiry, and take consideration of the same natures : but how? Only as to the material and efficient causes of them, and not as to the forms. For example; if the cause of whiteness in snow or froth be inquired, and it be rendered thus, that the subtile intermixture of air and water is the cause, it is well rendered ; but, nevertheless, is this the form of whiteness? No; but it is the efficient, which is ever but ''vehiculum formæ''. This part of metaphysique I do not find laboured and performed...|Francis Bacon, ''[[Advancement of Learning]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/advancementlea00bacouoft#page/88/mode/2up/search/whiteness II.VII.6]}}

[[File:Francis Bacon.jpg|thumb|left|Francis Bacon]]
In his ''[[Novum Organum]]'' Bacon argued that the only forms or natures we should hypothesize are the "simple" (as opposed to compound) ones such as the ways in which [[heat]], [[Motion (physics)|movement]], etc. work. For example, in aphorism 51 he writes:

{{Quotation|51. The human understanding is, by its own nature, prone to abstraction, and supposes that which is fluctuating to be fixed. But it is better to dissect than abstract nature; such was the method employed by the school of Democritus, which made greater progress in penetrating nature than the rest. It is best to consider matter, its conformation, and the changes of that conformation, its own action, and the law of this action or motion, for forms are a mere fiction of the human mind, unless you will call the laws of action by that name.}}

Following Bacon's advice, the scientific search for the formal cause of things is now replaced by the search for "[[natural law|laws of nature]]" or "[[law of physics|laws of physics]]" in all scientific thinking. To use Aristotle's well-known terminology these are descriptions of [[efficient cause]], and not [[formal cause]] or [[final cause]]. It means modern science limits its hypothesizing about non-physical things to the assumption that there are regularities to the ways of all things which do not change.

These general laws, in other words, replace thinking about ''specific'' "laws", for example "''human'' nature". In modern science, human nature is part of the same general scheme of cause and effect, obeying the same general laws, as all other things. The above-mentioned difference between accidental and substantial properties, and indeed knowledge and opinion, also disappear within this new approach that aimed to avoid metaphysics.

As Bacon knew, the term "laws of nature" was one taken from medieval [[Aristotelianism]]. St Thomas of Aquinas for example, defined law so that nature really was legislated to consciously achieve aims, like human law: "an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community and promulgated".&lt;ref&gt;Summa Theologiae I-II Q90, A4&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, roughly contemporary with Bacon, Hugo [[Grotius]] described the law of nature as "a rule that [can] be deduced from fixed principles by a sure process of reasoning".&lt;ref&gt;''[[On the Law of War and Peace]]'', Proleg. 40&lt;/ref&gt; And later still, Montesquieu was even further from the original legal metaphor, describing laws vaguely as "the necessary relations deriving from the nature of things".&lt;ref&gt;The [[Spirit of the Laws]], opening lines&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Thomas Hobbes (portrait).jpg|thumb|right|Thomas Hobbes]]
One of the most important implementors of Bacon's proposal was [[Thomas Hobbes]], whose remarks concerning nature are particularly well-known. His most famous work, ''[[Leviathan (Hobbes book)|Leviathan]]'', opens with the word "Nature" and then parenthetically defines it as "the art whereby [[God]] hath made and governes the world". Despite this pious description, he follows a Baconian approach. Following his contemporary, [[Descartes]], Hobbes describes life itself as mechanical, caused in the same way as [[clockwork]]:

{{Quotation | For seeing life is but a motion of Limbs, the beginning whereof is in some principall part within; why may we not say, that all Automata (Engines that move themselves by springs and wheeles as doth a watch) have an artificiall life?}}

On this basis, already being established in [[natural science]] in his lifetime, Hobbes sought to discuss politics and human life in terms of "laws of nature". But in the new modern approach of Bacon and Hobbes, and before them [[Machiavelli]] (who however never clothed his criticism of the Aristotelian approach in medieval terms like "laws of nature"),&lt;ref&gt;[[The Prince]] 15:- "...since my intent is to write something useful to whoever understands it, it has appeared to me more fitting to go directly to the effectual truth of the thing than to the imagination of it. And many have imagined republics and principalities that have never been seen or known to exist in truth; for it is so far from how one lives to how one should live that he who lets go of what is done for what should be done learns his ruin rather than his preservation. For a man who wants to make a profession of good in all regards must come to ruin among so many who are not good. Hence it is necessary to a prince, if he wants to maintain himself, to learn to be able not to be good, and to use this and not use it according to necessity."&lt;/ref&gt; such laws of nature are quite different to human laws: they no longer imply any sense of better or worse, but simply how things really are, and, when in reference to laws of ''human'' nature, what sorts of human behavior can be most relied upon.

=="Late modern" nature==
[[File:Rousseau.jpg|right|thumb|Jean-Jacques Rousseau: a civilized man, but a person who questioned whether civilization was according to human nature.]]
Having disconnected the term "law of nature" from the original medieval metaphor of human-made law, the term "law of nature" is now used less than in early modern times.

To take the critical example of human nature, as discussed in ethics and politics, once early modern philosophers such as Hobbes had described human nature as whatever you could expect from a mechanism called a human, the point of speaking of human nature became problematic in some contexts.

In the late 18th century, [[Rousseau]] took a critical step in his [[Second Discourse]], reasoning that [[human nature]] as we know it, [[Rationality|rational]], and with [[language]], and so on, is a result of historical accidents, and the specific up-bringing of an individual. The consequences of this line of reasoning were to be enormous. It was all about the question of nature. In effect it was being claimed that human nature, one of the most important types of nature in Aristotelian thinking, did not exist as it had been understood to exist.

==The survival of metaphysics==

The approach of modern science, like the approach of Aristotelianism, is apparently not universally accepted by all people who accept the concept of nature as a reality which we can pursue with reason.

Bacon and other opponents of Metaphysics claim that all attempts to go beyond nature are bound to fall into the same errors, but Metaphysicians themselves see differences between different approaches.

[[Immanuel Kant]] for example, expressed the need for a Metaphysics in quite similar terms to Aristotle.

{{Quotation|...though we cannot know these objects as things in themselves, we must yet be in a position at least to think them as things in themselves; otherwise we should be landed in the absurd conclusion that there can be appearance without anything that appears.|''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' pp. Bxxvi-xxvii}}

As in Aristotelianism then, Kantianism claims that the human mind must itself have characteristics which are beyond nature, metaphysical, in some way. Specifically, Kant argued that the human mind comes ready-made with ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' programming, so to speak, which allows it to make sense of nature.

==The study of nature without metaphysics==

Authors from [[Nietzsche]] to [[Richard Rorty]] have claimed that science, the study of nature, can and should exist without metaphysics. But this claim has always been controversial. Authors like Bacon and Hume never denied that their use of the word "nature" implied metaphysics, but tried to follow Machiavelli's approach of talking about what works, instead of claiming to understand what seems impossible to understand.

'''Philosophy of psychology''' refers to the many issues at the theoretical foundations of modern [[psychology]]. 

==Overview==
Some of the issues studied by the philosophy of psychology are [[epistemological]] concerns about the [[methodology]] of psychological investigation. For example:
* What is the most appropriate methodology for psychology: [[mentalism (psychology)|mentalism]], [[behaviorism]], or a compromise?
* Are self-reports a reliable data-gathering&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = R. Stewart Ellis | publisher = Kettering University | title = Research data gathering techniques | year = 2010 |url = https://paws.kettering.edu/~ellis/mycourse/ssci201/r-d-g-t-good-bad.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; method?
* What conclusions can be drawn from [[null hypothesis]] tests?
* Can first-person experiences (emotions, desires, beliefs, etc.) be measured objectively?

Other issues in philosophy of psychology are philosophical questions about the nature of mind, [[brain]], and [[cognition]], and are perhaps more commonly thought of as part of [[cognitive science]], or [[philosophy of mind]], such as:
* What is a [[cognitive module]]?
* Are humans [[rationality|rational]] creatures?
* What psychological phenomena come up to the standard required for calling it [[knowledge]]?
* What is [[innate]]ness?

Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[evolutionary psychology]], and [[artificial intelligence]], for example questioning whether psychological phenomena can be explained using the methods of [[neuroscience]], [[evolutionary theory]], and computational modeling, respectively. Although these are all closely related fields, some concerns still arise about the appropriateness of importing their methods into psychology. Some such concerns are whether psychology, as the study of individuals as information processing systems (see [[Donald Broadbent]]), is autonomous from what happens in the brain (even if psychologists largely agree that the brain in some sense causes behavior (see [[supervenience]])); whether the mind is "hard-wired" enough for evolutionary investigations to be fruitful; and whether computational models can do anything more than offer possible implementations of cognitive theories that tell us nothing about the mind (Fodor &amp; Pylyshyn 1988).

Philosophy of psychology is a relatively young field because "scientific" psychology—that is, psychology that favors experimental methods over [[introspection]]—came to dominate psychological studies only in the late 19th century. One of philosophy of psychology's concerns is to evaluate the merits of the many different schools of psychology that have been and are practiced. For example, [[cognitive psychology]]'s use of internal mental states might be compared with [[behaviorism]], and the reasons for the widespread rejection of behaviorism in the mid-20th century examined.

Topics that fall within [[philosophy of mind]] go back much farther. For example, questions about the very nature of mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between [[mind-body dualism|dualism]] and [[monism]] have been discussed in philosophy for many centuries.

Related to philosophy of psychology are philosophical and epistemological inquiries about [[clinical psychiatry]] and [[psychopathology]]. Philosophy of psychiatry is mainly concerned with the role of values in psychiatry: derived from philosophical [[value theory]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], values-based practice is aimed at improving and humanizing clinical decision-making in the highly complex environment of mental health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Fulford KWM, Stanghellini G. |title=The Third Revolution: Philosophy into Practice in Twenty-first Century Psychiatry |journal=Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=5–14 |year=2008 |url=http://www.crossingdialogues.com/fulford.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophy of psychopathology is mainly involved in the epistemological reflection about the implicit philosophical foundations of [[psychiatric]] classification and evidence-based psychiatry. Its aim is to unveil the constructive activity underlying the description of mental phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Aragona M |title=Il mito dei fatti.

The '''Remote Sensing Center''' (RSC) at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]] was established to bring together a range of capabilities and expertise to address problems of military and intelligence importance, as well as environmental and civil concerns.  It is specialized in a variety of [[remote sensing]] technologies designed to enable people to look beyond the range of human vision in range or in spectral perception.

== Mission ==

Members of the RSC come from the [[physics]], electrical and computer engineering, computer science, [[meteorology]], and [[oceanography]] departments.  They are collaborating to develop new remote sensing systems, as well as use and exploit current systems in air and space.  It is part of a larger activity in the [[Monterey Bay]] area that provides expertise in topical areas outside the technical disciplines available at NPS.

The Naval Postgraduate School, and specifically the Remote Sensing Center, has the ability to handle classified data, as well as access to a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) that is fully equipped with comms, storage, and processing capabilities.  The RSC has pre-established cooperative research with government, academia, and industry in the remote sensing sector ranging from local to international partners.  Highly experienced military officers, intelligence analysts, and faculty are a critical part of the NPS research staff.

==Projects==

=== Lidar ===
''[[Lidar]]'' (LIght raDAR) works as an optical analog to [[radar]] in the visible spectrum of light with advantages related to the smaller wavelengths of the laser pulse.  Lidar ranges in wavelength from ultra-violet (0.3-0.45&amp;nbsp;µm) to visible (0.45-0.70&amp;nbsp;µm) to the infrared (1-15&amp;nbsp;µm).  Lidar can detect much smaller particles than radar in the atmosphere (which cannot detect things smaller than cloud particles), and thus can be used for aerosol detection.

The raw form of data is a set of x,y,z coordinate points.  With recent advances, resolution has improved dramatically.  Raw data can be processed to remove unwanted areas or features.  Outputs such as topographic maps with contour lines can also be derived from lidar.  Programs to manipulate lidar data include ENVI, [[ERDAS IMAGINE]], [[ArcInfo]], and [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]] ArcView (with 3D analyst ext.)  One useful derivation of lidar data is the DEM ([[Digital Elevation Model]]). DEMs are displayed in a raster format with a matrix.  The DEM has a specified cell size that corresponds to the earth’s surfaces.  The cell contains the average elevation of the points within it. 

The Remote Sensing Center is planning research projects that undertake the modeling and testing of analytical processing and using more fieldwork to obtain ground-truth measurements.  Projects have been completed and are currently underway in terrain classification including [[Elkhorn Slough]] and hidden trail identification.  Other future projects include a collaboration with the MOdeling, Virtual Environments, and Simulation (MOVES) institute on lidar standards for data structure and visualization tools and modeling new lidar analysis tools.

=== Spectral Imagery Analysis ===

Spectral imagery measures the spectral character of materials within the visible range and beyond.  Two objects may appear visually identical but may be distinguished through examination of their spectral properties.  Computer software can use a color scheme to make them visible.

A subset of spectral imagery, [[hyperspectral imaging]] data, is produced when "solar electromagnetic energy reflected from the earth's surface is dispersed into many contiguous narrow spectral bands by an airborne spectrometer" (Stefanou, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;2). Our current research and projects include environmental mapping, target detection, and change detection.

The Remote Sensing Center works with airborne and satellite systems including [[IKONOS]]/[[Quickbird]] [[multispectral imagery]] (MSI), and airborne hyperspectral imaging (HSI) systems including [[AVIRIS]], HYDICE, CASI, and HYMAP.  Classification and analysis, including atmospheric compensation is performed using standard industry research tools; notably ENVI and ERDAS Imagine.  The RSC has acquired a [[polarimetry|polarimetric]] camera for expanding experimentation in the visible spectrum.

==Intelligence==
The Remote Sensing Center benefits from the secure facilities at NPS.  Having the ability to process classified data with an on-site, fully equipped Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility (SCIF) allows students and faculty to pursue lines of research and work with technologies unavailable to the public.

The sustained efforts of fully funded graduate students, both military and civilian with an average of eight to ten years of field experience, have conducted research in an array of topics related to remote sensing.

*Current projects include:
:Helicopter Brownout (terrain classification) using National Technical Means (NTM)
:Maritime Domain Awareness (ASW)
:Snow/Ice study with UCSB using NTM

==Degree Programs==
The Remote Sensing Research and Education Program (RS-REP) is an interdisciplinary program to promote Remote Sensing technical education and research advancement to ensure that the Intelligence Community is fully supported for technology evolution.  The curriculum is in hiatus as of 2017.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12989">[[Thomas P. Hughes]],&lt;ref name="hughes"&gt;Hughes, T. P. (1983). Networks of power: Electrification in western society, 1880-1930. USA: The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in his {{According to whom|seminal book,|date=July 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Kranzberg, "History &amp; Technology: Kranzberg's Laws" ''Society for the History of Technology'', 1986&lt;/ref&gt; ''Networks of power: Electrification in western society, 1880-1930'', introduces the concept in the analysis of technological systems, whereby the reverse salient refers to a component of the system that, due to its insufficient development, prevents the technological system in its entirety achieving its targeted development.

==Technological systems and their evolution==
Technological systems may refer to a [[hierarchy|hierarchically]] nested structure of technological parts, whereby the [[system]] is seen as a composition of [[interdependence|interdependent]] sub-systems that are themselves systems comprising further sub-systems.&lt;ref name="tushman and murmann"&gt;[[Tushman, M.L.]] &amp; Murmann, J.P. 1998, "Dominant Designs, Technology Cycles, and Organizational Outcomes", Research in Organizational Behavior, vol. 20, pp. 231-266.&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, the holistic system as well as its properties is seen to be [[:wikt:synthesized|synthesized]] through the sub-systems that constitute it. Technological systems may also be seen as [[sociotechnical systems|socio-technical systems]] that contain, in addition to technical sub-systems, social sub-systems, such as the creators and users of [[technology]], as well as overseeing regulatory bodies. In both perspectives, technological systems are seen to be goal-seeking, therefore evolving towards objectives.&lt;ref name="sahal"&gt;Sahal, D. 1981, Patterns of Technological Evolution, Addison-Wesley, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; proposes that technological systems pass through certain phases during the system’s evolution. The first of these phases sees the invention and development of the system, owed greatly to the efforts of inventors and [[entrepreneur]]s, such as [[Thomas Edison]] in the development of the electric technological system. The second stage is the era of technological transfer from one region or society to others, for example, the dissemination of Edison’s electric system from New York City to other cities such as London and Berlin. The third phase of systemic evolution is marked by a period of system growth and expansion when the technological system strives to improve its performance, for instance with respect to economic outcomes or [[Output (economics)|output]] efficiency. In this phase, the system is dependent on the satisfactory evolution of all its components’ performances. The development of the technological systems is therefore reliant on the reciprocated and interdependent cause and effect [[Process (science)|processes]] amongst social and technical components, and may be described as [[coevolution|co-evolutionary]], where the balanced co-evolution of system components carries significance in establishing desired system progress. Subsequently, a sub-system which evolves at a sufficient pace contribute positively to the collective development, while a sub-system which does not develop sufficiently prevents the technology system achieving its targeted development. Hughes names these problematic sub-systems reverse salients.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hughes2"&gt;Hughes, T.P. 1987, "The Evolution of Large Technological Systems" in The Social Construction of Technological Systems, eds. W.E. Bijker, T.P. Hughes &amp; T.P. Pinch, The MIT Press, USA, pp. 51-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse salients in technological system evolution==
A reverse salient is the inverse of a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] that depicts the forward protrusion along an object’s profile or a line of battle.&lt;ref name="hughes2" /&gt; Hence, reverse salients are the backward projections along similar, continuous lines. The reverse salient subsequently refers to the sub-system that has strayed behind the advancing performance frontier of the system due to its lack of sufficient performance. In turn, the reverse salient hampers the progress or prevents the fulfillment of potential development of the collective system. In line with the socio-technical standpoint, reverse salients can be technical elements such as [[electric motor|motors]] and [[capacitor]]s of an electric system, or social elements such as organizations or productive units.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;

Because reverse salients limit system development, the further development of the system lies in the correction of the reverse salient, where correction is attained through incremental or radical [[innovation]]s. The reverse salient denotes a focusing device, in the words of [[Nathan Rosenberg]],&lt;ref name="rosenberg"&gt;Rosenberg, N. (1969). The direction of technological change: Inducement mechanisms and focusing devices. Economic Development and Cultural Change, 18, 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; for technological system [[Stakeholder theory|stakeholders]], which strive to remove it through innovation. It is possible that the reverse salient is not able to be corrected within the bounds of the existing technological system through [[innovation|incremental innovations]]. Consequently, [[innovation|radical innovations]] may be needed to correct the reverse salient. However, radical innovations can lead to the creation of new and different technological systems, as witnessed in the emergence of the [[alternating current]] system that overcame the problem of low cost electricity distribution, which the [[direct current]] system could not.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;

Hence, the reverse salient is a useful concept for analyzing technological system evolution,&lt;ref name="dedehayir"&gt;Dedehayir, O. 2009, "[http://www.jiem.org/index.php/jiem/article/view/125 Bibliometric study of the reverse salient concept]", ''[[Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management]]'', Vol 2, No 3.&lt;/ref&gt; because often the analysis of technological systems centers on the factors that limit system development. More than technical components, these factors may also be social components. Subsequently, reverse salients may be more applicable in certain contexts to denote system performance hindrance than similar or overlapping concepts such as [[wikt:bottleneck|bottleneck]] and technological imbalance or disequilibrium.&lt;ref name="rosenberg2"&gt;Rosenberg, N. (1976). Perspectives on technology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reverse salient refers to an ''extremely complex situation in which individuals, groups, material forces, historical influences, and other factors have idiosyncratic, causal forces, and in which accidents as well as trends play a part. On the contrary, the disequilibrium concept suggests a relatively straightforward abstraction of physical science''.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; Additionally, while the reverse salient and bottleneck concepts share similarities and have been used interchangeably in particular contexts, the reverse salient often refers to the sub-system that not only curbs the performance or output of the collective system but also requires correction because of its limiting affect. This is not necessarily the case with bottlenecks, which are ''geometrically too symmetrical''&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; and therefore do not represent the complexity of system evolution. For instance, a particular system’s output performance may be compromised due to a bottleneck sub-system but the bottleneck will not require improvement if the system’s present output performance is satisfactory. If, on the other hand, a higher level of performance would be required of the same system, the bottleneck may emerge as a reverse salient that holds the system back from attaining that higher output performance.

==Reverse salient examples==
While numerous studies illustrate technological systems that have been hampered by reverse salients, the most seminal work in this field of study is that of Hughes,&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; who gives a historical account of the development of Edison’s direct-current electric system. In order to supply electricity within a defined region of distribution, sub-systems such as the [[Electrical generator|direct current generator]] were identified as reverse salients and corrected. The most notable limitation of the direct-current system was, however, its low voltage transmission distance, and the resulting cost of distributing electricity beyond a certain range. To reduce costs, Edison introduced a three-wire system to replace the previously installed two-wire alternative and trialed different configuration of generators, as well as the usage of storage batteries. These improvements however did not correct the reverse salient completely. The satisfactory resolution of the problem was eventually provided by the radical innovation of the alternating current system.

Since Hughes' seminal work, other authors have also provided examples of reverse salients in different technological systems. In the [[ballistic missile]] technological development, where the systemic objective has been to increase missile accuracy, [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|MacKenzie]]&lt;ref name="mackenzie"&gt;MacKenzie, D. (1987). Missile accuracy: A case study in the social processes of technological change. In W. E. Bijker, T. P. Hughes &amp; T. J. Pinch (Eds.), The social construction of technological systems (pp. 195-222). USA: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has identified the [[gyroscope]] sub-system as a technical reverse salient. Takeishi and Lee&lt;ref name="takeishi"&gt;Takeishi, A., &amp; Lee, K. (2005). Mobile music business in japan and korea: Copyright management institutions as a reverse salient. Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 14, 291-306.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that [[copyright|music copyright]] managing institutions have acted as a social reverse salient in the evolution of the [[mobile music]] technology system in Japan and Korea, where the objective was to proliferate mobile music throughout the end-user market. And further, Mulder and Knot,&lt;ref name="mulder"&gt;Mulder, K., &amp; Knot, M. (2001). PVC plastic: A history of systems development and entrenchment. Technology in Society, 23, 265-286.&lt;/ref&gt; see the development of the PVC ([[polyvinyl chloride]]) plastic technology system to have been sequentially hampered by several states of reverse salience, including: difficulty to process PVC material, quality of manufactured products, health concerns for individuals exposed to effluent from PVC manufacturing facilities, and finally the [[carcinogen]]ic nature of vinyl chloride.

==Analytical measure of reverse salience==
The magnitude of reverse salience emerges as an informative [[parameter]] in technological systems analysis as it signifies not only the technological disparity between sub-systems but also the entire system’s limited level of performance. Notwithstanding its importance, the literature studying technological system evolution has remained limited in terms of analytical tools that measure the state of reverse salience. Dedehayir and Mäkinen&lt;ref name="dedehayir makinen"&gt;[http://www.jotmi.org/index.php/GT/article/view/art87/158 Dedehayir, O. &amp; Mäkinen, S.J. 2008, "Dynamics of Reverse Salience as Technological Performance Gap: An Empirical Study of the Personal Computer Technology System", Journal of Technology Management and Innovation, vol. 3, no. 3, pp. 55-66.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="citer"&gt;[http://tta.mediacabinet.fi/en/research/citer/?id=82 CITER]&lt;/ref&gt; have subsequently proposed an [[Absolute value|absolute]] ''[http://www.jotmi.org/index.php/GT/article/view/art87/158 performance gap]'' measure of reverse salience magnitude. This measure evaluates the technological performance differential between the salient sub-system (i.e. the advanced sub-system) and the reverse salient sub-system at a particular point in time. In turn, by evaluating a series of performance differentials over time, the performance gap measure helps reflect the dynamics of change in the evolving technological system through changing reverse salience magnitude.

==Origin of term==
According to Thomas Hughes, the  name "reverse salient" was inspired by the Verdun [[Salient (military)|salient]] during the [[Battle of Verdun]], which he claimed his history professor in college referred to as a "reverse salient". He described it as a backward bulge in the advancing line of a [[military front]].&lt;ref name="American Heritage"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1985/6/1985_6_65.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the same as a [[Salient (military)|salient]]; moreover, "reverse salient" is not a military term in general usage.

}}'''Simon Dinnerstein''' (born February 16, 1943) is an American artist best known for ''The Fulbright Triptych''.

==Early life==
Dinnerstein was born in [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]], [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1943 to pharmacist Louis and homemaker Sarah Dinnerstein. One of two children, his older brother [[Harvey Dinnerstein]] is also an artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Simon and Simone Dinnerstein In Conversation: An Interview with Robin Quivers at the German Consulate of New York|url=http://vimeo.com/37105837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Dinnerstein holds a Bachelor of Arts in History from the [[City College of New York]]. He studied painting and drawing at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] Art School with Louis Grebenak, [[David Levine]], and Richard Mayhew.&lt;ref name=Dantzic&gt;{{cite book|last=Dantzic|first=Cynthia Maris|title=100 New York Painters|date=November 2006|publisher=Schiffer Publishing|isbn=978-0764325434|pages=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the faculty at the [[New School for Social Research]], [[Parsons School of Design]], and [[New York City Technical College]]. He lectures widely and has lectured at [[Pennsylvania State University]].&lt;ref name=Chronology&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology of Simon Dinnerstein|url=http://www.simondinnerstein.com/chronology.html|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and influences==
Dinnerstein's art is mostly in the [[figurative art|figurative]] style,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mertens|first=Richard|title=Essential Realities: Simon Dinnerstein Draws the Essence of Art from the Commonplace|newspaper=The Concord Monitor|date=October 25, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Folk art|folk]], [[expressionistic]], and [[surrealistic]] influences,&lt;ref name=Messer&gt;{{cite book|last=Messer|first=Thomas M.|title=The Art of Simon Dinnerstein|date=November 1990|publisher=The University of Arkansas Press|location=Foreword|isbn=978-1557281425}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Roberta|title=Rediscovered at the Altar of Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/12/arts/design/simon-dinnerstein-the-fulbright-triptych-review.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|accessdate=17 May 2014|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hagler&gt;{{cite web|last=Hagler|first=Elana|title=Pursuing Humanity: An Interview with Simon Dinnerstein|url=http://paintingperceptions.com/contemporary-realism/pursuing-humanity-an-interview-with-simon-dinnerstein|publisher=Painting Perceptions|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; possessing a "[[narrative]]"&lt;ref name=Messer /&gt; and "[[psychological]] edge".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Proctor|first=Roy|title=Exploring the Edge: No Slave to Fashion, Artist Draws Us Into Other States of Mind|newspaper=Richmond Times-Dispatch|date=August 20, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He uses a variety of media, [[pencils]], [[charcoal]], and [[oil paint]]s. Dinnerstein renders [[still-life]]'s, but most of his work involves [[portrait painting|portraiture]] or [[human figure]]s. He often "paints the figure in unexpected juxtaposition with [[landscape]] or interior elements,"&lt;ref name=Dantzic /&gt; of which Dinnerstein says,

&lt;blockquote&gt;What interests me is the ability of [[Degas]], [[Balthus]], [[Lucien Freud]] and [[Antonio Lopez Garcia]]…to deal with the figure…to create art…rich in scale, yet abstract adventurous, experimental…deeply human…a combination of modernism and tradition of skill medium and…a fresh, personal response to the human form in art…Hopefully my work speaks to these issues.&lt;ref name=Dantzic /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dinnerstein draws on diverse sources for inspiration: Northern European art ([[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Hieronymus Bosch]]&lt;ref name=Hagler /&gt;&lt;ref name="vimeo.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Triptych: An Evening of Painting and Music: Simon Dinnerstein &amp; Robert Sirota|url=http://vimeo.com/92970548|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Mexican art ([[Frida Kahlo]], [[Diego Rivera]]&lt;ref name=Davenport /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McLeod|first=Deborah|title=Bodies of Work: From Visceral Portraits to Romanticized Nymphs, Simon Dinnerstein's Retrospective at the Marsh Gallery Shows a Stylistic Niche through Every Turn of the Artist's Evolution |url=http://www.styleweekly.com/richmond/from-visceral-portraits-to-romanticized-nymphs-simon-dinnersteins-retrospective-at-the-marsh-gallery-shows-a-stylistic-niche-through-every/Content?oid=1386808 |accessdate=17 May 2014|newspaper=Richmond Style Weekly|date=September 1, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as literature ([[D.

Dinnerstein's most notable painting, ''The [[Fulbright]] Triptych'', was started in [[Germany]] in 1971&lt;ref name=Dinnerstein /&gt; while he served as a [[Fulbright Scholar]] in Graphics. It was completed in 1974.&lt;ref name="vimeo.com"/&gt;  A largely autobiographical work,&lt;ref name="Introduction: Simon Dinnerstein's Family Romance"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boime|first=Albert|title=The Art of Simon Dinnerstein|date=November 1990|publisher=The University of Arkansas Press|isbn=978-1557281425}}&lt;/ref&gt; it combines stark realism&lt;ref name=Messer /&gt; with American figurative tradition to produce a secular rendering of the usually religious form, the [[triptych]].

Writer [[Jonathan Lethem]] commented: "Simon Dinnerstein's 'The Fulbright Triptych' is one of those singular and astonishing works of art which seem to imply a description of the whole world merely by insisting on a scrupulous gaze at one perfect instant."&lt;ref name=Slager/&gt; The oil-on-wood painting consists of three panels approximately 14 feet wide, depicting a graphic artist's studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dinnerstein|first=Simon|title=The Fulbright Triptych|url=http://www.simondinnerstein.com/the_fulbright_triptych.html|accessdate=17 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three figures, representing the Dinnerstein family, occupy the outer panels. The central panel consists of the artist's desk,  engraving tools, a copper disk of the commissioned Fulbright engraving project, and an outward view in perspective of Hessisch Lichtenau (near to [[Kassel]]).&lt;ref name=Dinnerstein /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Russell|first=John|title=In Dinnerstein's Painting, An Echo Chamber|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 8, 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Plants, photographs, old master's paintings,  children's grade school writing, and an exit visa from Russia, appear tacked to the wall of the studio.&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dinnerstein /&gt;&lt;ref name="Introduction: Simon Dinnerstein's Family Romance"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=André|first=Michael|title=Simon Dinnerstein (Staempfli)|journal=Art News|date=March 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Triptych" is noted for its symmetry, meticulous detail,&lt;ref name=Messer /&gt; mixture of textures, and sense of space.

Widely praised, with each viewer bringing a different sensibility and interpretation of the work, the painting is the subject of numerous essays, articles, and books, including "The Suspension of Time: Reflections of Simon Dinnerstein's The Fulbright Triptych" edited by Daniel Slager, published 2011. Among the many who have commented on the painting are art critic [[John Russell (art critic)|John Russell]], [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] director [[Thomas M. Messer]], art historian [[Albert Boime]], artist [[George Tooker]], writer [[Anthony Doerr]], composer [[George Crumb]], poet [[Dan Beachy-Quick]], actor [[John Turturro]], and [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Jhumpa Lahiri]].

[[File:GCDickens-one-man-show.jpg|thumb|right|[[Gerald Charles Dickens (actor)|Gerald Dickens]] in solo performance of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'']]
A '''solo performance''', sometimes referred to as a '''one-man show''' or '''one-woman show''', features a single person telling a story for an audience, typically for the purpose of entertainment. This type of performance comes in many varieties, including autobiographical creations, comedy acts, novel adaptations, vaudeville, poetry, music, and dance.&lt;ref name="ExtAnth"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://users.erols.com/jobonney/index.htm|title=Extreme Exposure: An Anthology of Solo Performance Texts from the Twentieth Century|last=Bonney|first=Jo|author2=Anthology|date=1 February 1999|publisher=Theatre Communications Group; 1st edition|isbn=1-55936-155-7|editor=Jo Bonney|edition=1st|pages=450|chapter=preface xiii|accessdate=28 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traits of solo performance ==
Solo performance is used to encompass the broad term of a single person performing for an audience. Some key traits of solo performance can include the lack of the [[fourth wall]] and audience participation or involvement. Solo performance does not need to be written, performed, and produced by a single person-- a solo performance production may utilize directors, writers, designers, and composers to bring the piece to life on a stage. An example of this collaboration is [[Eric Bogosian]] in the published version of his show ''Wake Up And Smell the Coffee'', by [[Theatre Communications Group]], [[New York City]]. &lt;ref&gt;Bonney, Jo. ''Extreme Exposure: an Anthology of Solo Performance Texts from the Twentieth Century''. Theatre Communications Group, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It is assumed that individuals have told stories in front of other members of their tribe or society for thousands of years. They would have [[Speech communication|orally]] passed down many of today's [[Mythology|myths]] and [[legend]]s in this manner.&lt;ref name="ExtAnth" /&gt; So it is a style of performance that has been with us for generations developing through theatrical people such as [[Greek people|Greek]] [[Monologists]], the strolling [[Minstrels]] of [[Medieval England]] and the French [[Troubadors]].

[[Edgar Allan Poe]] both lectured and recited poetry as a platform performer between 1843 and 1849; his performances stand as a paradigm of the solo performance hybrid simply called "the lecture-recital". The reading tours of [[Charles Dickens]] in Britain and America between 1858 and 1870 created a sensation. His American tour of 1867–68 was unparalleled until the arrival of the Beatles in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gentile|first=John S. |year=1989|title= Cast of One. One-Person Shows from the Chautauqua Platform to the Broadway Stage| publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]| isbn=978-0252015847 |pages= 10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solo performance enjoyed an unprecedented artistic and commercial vogue in the United States during the second half of the nineteenth century (John S. Gentile Calls it the golden age of platform performance). Literary historians often associate the [[Victorian era|Victorian period]] with the highest development of the dramatic monologue as a poetic form. There were several discussions about the importance and distinction between the literary monologue and the performance monologue during the nineteenth century, however, this discussions confirms a continuous interchange between literature and performance, which may at times appear competitive but is more often productive. By the time the United States entered the 20th century, the number and variety of professional solo performances presented throughout the country had grown large.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, pages 61–64.&lt;/ref&gt; This renaissance of solo performance also created ripples in the larger sense of American theatre; after this "boom" of the one man show had passed, the presentational style seeped into popular theatre productions such as ''Amadeus'', ''Equus'', and ''Evita'' among others, modeling a combination of representational theatricality and presentational, direct-address style.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, pages 194–195.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1960s, the term [[performance art]] became popular and involved any number of performance acts or [[happenings]], as they were known. Many performers, like [[Laurie Anderson]], developed through these happenings and are still performing today.

==Types and Examples of Solo Performance ==
The backgrounds of solo performers over the decades range from [[vaudeville]], comedy, poetry, music, the [[visual arts]], [[magic (illusion)|magic]], [[cabaret]], [[theatre]] and [[dance]].&lt;ref name="ExtAnth" /&gt;

Solo performers include [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Andy Kaufman]], Rod Maxwell, [[Lord Buckley]], [[Eric Bogosian]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Jade Esteban Estrada]], [[Eddie Izzard]], [[John Leguizamo]], [[Marga Gomez]], [[Anna Deavere Smith]], [[Bill Hicks]], [[Brother Blue]] and [[Lenny Bruce]].&lt;ref name="ExtAnth" /&gt;

Several performers have presented solo shows in tribute to famous personalities. The blueprint for this type of show may have been drafted by [[Hal Holbrook]], who has performed as [[Mark Twain]] in his solo show, ''[[Mark Twain Tonight]]'', more than 2,000 times since 1954. Examples since that time include [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]] in the [[Emily Dickinson]] biography, ''[[The Belle of Amherst]]''; [[Tovah Feldshuh]] as Golda Meir in ''[[Golda's Balcony]]''; [[Frank Gorshin]] as [[George Burns]] in ''[[Say Goodnight, Gracie|Say Goodnight Gracie]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=13425 Ibdb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Rupert Holmes]]; [[Ed Metzger]] in his solo show, performing since 1978, ''[[Albert Einstein: The Practical Bohemian]]''; Metzger in another solo performance, ''[[Hemingway: On the Edge]]''; [[Henry Fonda]] as [[Clarence Darrow]] in ''Darrow'', and [[Tom Dugan (American actor)|Tom Dugan]] as [[Simon Wiesenthal]] in ''Wiesenthal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=Stoudt, Charlotte|title=Theater review: 'Nazi Hunter – Simon Wiesenthal' at Theatre 40|date=26 May 2011|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2011/05/theater-review-nazi-hunter-simon-wiesenthal-at-theatre-40.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few actors adapted entire novels for the stage including [[Patrick Stewart]] who played all 43 parts in his version of ''[[A Christmas Carol (play)|A Christmas Carol]]'', which played three times on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and at[[The Old Vic]] in [[London]]; actor [[Gerald Charles Dickens (actor)|Gerald Charles Dickens]] played 26 characters in his performances from the same work; and [[Jack Aranson]] starred in a solo, 13-character production of ''[[Moby Dick]]''.

Solo performance may be personal, autobiographical creations. This ranges from the intensely confessional but comedic work of [[Spalding Gray]], the semi-autobiographical ''[[A Bronx Tale (play)|A Bronx Tale]]'' by [[Chaz Palminteri]], or [[Holly Hughes (performance artist)|Holly Hughes]]' solo piece ''World without End,'' in which she attempts to make sense of her relationship with her mother who had died. Another example of this is ''In The Body of the World,'' written and performed by [[Eve Ensler]] in 2018.

Still other shows may rally around a central theme, such as pop culture in Pat Hazel's ''The Wonderbread Years'', relationships in Robert Dubac's ''The Male Intellect'', the history of the New York City transit system in [[Mike Daisey]]'s ''Invincible Summer'', or fighting the system in [[Patrick Combs]]' ''Man 1, Bank 0''. these themes could also be centered around a certain topic such as a political or social issue.&lt;ref name="ExtAnth" /&gt; [[Tim Miller (performance artist)|Tim Miller]] explores the topic of gay culture and society surrounding the LGBTQ community in his production of ''My Queer Body''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://hemisphericinstitute.org/hemi/en/modules/item/2636-tim-miller-body|title=My Queer Body (1992)|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karen Finley]] expressed her frustration with the standards women are held to and the issues surrounding them such as rape and abortion in her solo piece titled ''We Keep Our Victims Ready''.&lt;ref&gt;Neely, Kent. "Theatre Journal." ''Theatre Journal'', vol. 42, no. 4, 1990, pp. 495–497. ''JSTOR'', JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/3207728.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, solo shows are simply traditional plays written by playwrights for a cast of one. Examples: ''[[Shirley Valentine]]'' by [[Willy Russell]], ''[[I Am My Own Wife]]'' by [[Doug Wright]], ''[[The Blonde, the Brunette and the Vengeful Redhead]]'' by Robert Hewett and ''[[Topless (stage play)|Topless]]'' by [[Miles Tredinnick]]. A performer of shows of this type is [[Chris Harris (actor)|Chris Harris]], whose performances in the genre include ''Kemp's Jig'', ''That's The Way To Do It!'', ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]'', ''Beemaster'', '''Arris Music 'All'' and ''A Night at the Pantomime''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Harris|work=Chrisharrisproductions.co.uk|url=http://www.chrisharrisproductions.co.uk/one%20man%20shows.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been many British comedians who have moved away from performing pure stand-up comedy in recent years. The shows that appear annually at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] can involve stories of [[pathos]] and the use of technological equipment such as [[Image projector|projector]]s. Examples include [[Howard Read]], who has performed with the animated character [[Little Howard]] which was projected with the aid of computers and [[Dave Gorman]], who has performed several shows described as "documentary comedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hudson|first=Ben|title=Dead Funny: Posthumous liveness in mediatized stand-up comedy performance.|url=https://www.academia.edu/7110762/Dead_Funny_Posthumous_liveness_in_mediatized_stand-up_comedy_performance|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solo performance in Film==
The First full-length talking film who showed only a single character was Sofi, a 1968 film starring [[Tom Troupe]]. The film was based on "[[Diary of a Madman (short story)|Diary of a Madman]]" by [[Gogol]].
In the [[21st century]] the "solo performance" had a rejuvenation period. with films like [[Locke (film)|Locke]], [[All Is Lost]] and [[Buried (film)|Buried]]. The characteristics were different from the previous one character films that were made - mainly by location and style. Sofi and works like [[Give 'em Hell, Harry!]], were still studio filmed theater pieces. The 21th century films were mostly shot on location and were much more stylized with their cinematic expression and camera usage. Most recently films by [[Marcus Tell]] showed ongoing characteristics of one character films. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/list/ls059718934/|title=One actor movies|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sphaerotilus natans''''' is an aquatic [[periphyton]] organism associated with polluted water.  It forms colonies commonly known as "sewage fungus", but later identified as tightly sheathed filamentous [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;Fair, Geyer &amp; Okun p.32-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology==
Straight or smoothly curved filaments 1.5&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter and 100 to more than 500&amp;nbsp;µm in length are formed by rod-shaped cells with clear [[septum|septa]] growing within a long, tubular sheath.  An adhesive basal element at one end of the filament can aid attachment to solid surfaces.&lt;ref name="aem"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pellegrin |first1=Véronique  |last2=Juretschko |first2=Stefan  |last3=Wagner |first3= Michael |last4=Cottenceau  |first4=Gilles |year=1999 |title=Morphological and Biochemical Properties of a Sphaerotilus sp.

''S. natans'' stores reserves of [[beta-Hydroxybutyric acid|poly- ''beta'' -hydroxybutyrate]] as internal globules making up 30 to 40% of the dry weight of a colony.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;   Gram and Neisser staining reactions are negative.&lt;ref name="ebs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebsbiowizard.com/resources/micro-gallery/sphaerotilus-natans/|title=Sphaerotilus natans|publisher=Environmental Business Specialists LLC|accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
''S. natans'' requires dissolved simple [[sugar]]s or [[organic acid]]s as a food supply, but needs less [[phosphorus]] than many competing organisms and can tolerate low [[oxygen]] concentrations.&lt;ref name="ebs"/&gt;  Capability to deposit elemental [[sulfur]] intracellularly in the presence of [[hydrogen sulfide]] is believed to be a detoxifying mechanism.  ''S. natans'' requires either [[cobalamin]] or [[methionine]] as a trace nutrient.&lt;ref name="nih"/&gt;  ''S. natans'' filaments can aid development of a periphyton [[biofilm]] trapping suspended particles and stabilizing colonies of other organisms including ''[[Klebsiella]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas]]''.&lt;ref name="aem"/&gt;

==Significance==
''Sphaerotilus natans'' is often associated with a buoyant floc (or "bulking sludge") causing poor solids separation in [[activated sludge]] [[clarifier]]s of [[Sewage treatment#Secondary treatment|secondary sewage treatment]].&lt;ref name="h55"/&gt;  Metal surfaces covered with ''S. natans'' may experience accelerated [[corrosion]] if the slime creates a barrier causing differential oxygen concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;Betz pp.288&amp;289&lt;/ref&gt;  ''S. natans'' slimes may reduce quality of paper produced by [[paper mill]]s using recycled water streams.&lt;ref name="aem"/&gt;

The '''Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA)''' study was a [[National Science Foundation]]-funded research project designed to quantify the heat transfer processes that occur between the [[ocean]] and the [[atmosphere]] over the course of a year in the [[Arctic Ocean]], where the [[sun]] is above the [[horizon]] from [[spring (season)|spring]] through [[summer]] and below the horizon the rest of the time. The study was designed to provide data for use in [[global climate model]]s, which scientists use to study [[global climate change]].&lt;ref name ="Perovich"&gt;

==Background==
Ice reflects sunlight more readily than open water. Snow-covered sea ice reflects about 80% of the incident sunlight. Seasonal changes in the Arctic result in clear skies and radiational cooling from snow-covered sea ice in the constantly dark arctic winter. In spring, with the return of sunlight, melt pools begin to form and increase the rate of heat absorption from the sun. In the summer, during constant daylight, clouds form which reflect light to the sky, but impede heat flow from the ocean. In order to quantify these effects over a large portion of earth's area—the Arctic Ocean—required a large-scale scientific data-gathering and analysis effort over the span of a year.&lt;ref name ="Perovich"/&gt; Consequently, the [[National Science Foundation]], together with other sponsors,&lt;ref&gt;Primary sponsorship came from the NSF Arctic System Science Program, under grants from the Office of Polar Programs (Division of Ocean Sciences and Division of Atmospheric Sciences), with additional support from the Office of Naval Research and the Japan Marine Science and Technology Center.&lt;/ref&gt; funded a study to better quantify these processes.&lt;ref name="Uttal"&gt;

==Ice Station SHEBA==
[[File:Ice Station SHEBA-CRREL.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Ice station SHEBA base, ''[[CCGS Des Groseilliers|Canadian Coast Guard Ship Des Groseilliers]]'' (right) with ''[[CCGS Louis S. St-Laurent]]''.]]
The scientific party traveled aboard the [[CCGS Des Groseilliers|Canadian Coast Guard Ship Des Groseilliers]] to the Arctic Ocean. It arrived at a location on 2 October 1997 where the plan was to allow the ship to become frozen in the [[pack ice]] and be the base for scientific observations. Those observations included measurements of the oceanic and atmospheric processes from the water beneath the ice, near the ship, to the top of the atmosphere. Measurements included:  
* Radiative fluxes: longwave and shortwave
* Heat flux: turbulent fluxes of latent and sensible heat
* Cloud height, thickness and other properties
* Processes of energy exchange in the boundary layers of the atmosphere and ocean
* Snow depth and ice thickness
* Ocean salinity, temperature, and currents
The ship remained stationary with respect to the ice for one year, leaving on 11 October 1998. It became known as "Ice Station SHEBA."&lt;ref name ="Perovich"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ice Station SHEBA" is a reference to the novel, ''[[Ice Station Zebra (novel)|Ice Station Zebra]],'' or [[Ice Station Zebra|film]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
[[File:Summer Arctic Melt Pond-SHEBA.JPG|thumb|right|300px|SHEBA researchers taking data in a melted area of the Arctic Ocean ice pack.]]
The scientists found clouds to be common at the ship's location throughout the year. In the midwinter, there was reportedly overcast 40% of the time and in the summer the sky was continually overcast. Air temperature was 0.6&amp;nbsp;°C lower than the regional climatological average temperature. With no sun in the winter, the net flow of heat (flux) was from the surface of the ocean to the sky, marked with large differences in flux with changes in cloud cover. In April the flux changed toward solar warming of the surface of the sea, which reached a maximum in July when sunlight was strongest and the ice developed melt ponds which were much darker than snow and could absorb sunlight more efficiently.&lt;ref name ="Perovich"/&gt;

The scientists also measured the net change in mass of the ice and snow pack at 100 sites. They noted a wide variability of change over the region surrounding the ship. They determined that, with the waning sunlight of fall, the temperature in the ice dropped such that, by November, it was generating new growth at the bottom of the ice pack. From these observations, they identified five phases of change in heat budget:&lt;ref name ="Perovich"/&gt;
* Dry snow
* Melting snow
* Pond formation
* Pond evolution
* Fall freeze-up.

==Modeling==
The experimental results allowed meaningful modeling of the seasonal heat budget processes occurring through the Arctic Ocean sea ice and atmosphere. The scope of the model was the column from below the ice pack through the top of the atmosphere. The scientists realized that key to the model was correctly characterizing the changing reflectivity or [[albedo]] of the ice surface, owing to changes in snow pack and ice melting. Cloud cover was key to describing how much energy reached or escaped the ocean surface.&lt;ref name="Perovich"/&gt;

===Ocean processes===

The model incorporated the observation that solar radiation is the dominant heat source to the surface. It accounted for the change in open ocean from a 5% maximum in June and the changes in albedo. Approximately 8% of incoming solar radiation was absorbed into the ocean through the ice.&lt;ref name ="Perovich"/&gt;

===Atmosphere processes===
The scientists were able to define parameters for near-surface turbulence that characterize the degree to which air movement can cool or warm the surface of the ice, seasonally. In summer, the surface becomes rougher and slows down air flow. The [[lidar]] cloud measurements and balloonsonde temperature and turbulence data allowed scientific characterization of the role of the atmosphere above the ice in promoting or inhibiting the warming or cooling of the ocean surface.&lt;ref name ="Perovich"/&gt;

The '''teleological''' or '''physico-theological argument''', also known as the '''argument from design''', or '''intelligent design argument''' is an argument for the [[existence of God]] or, more generally, for an intelligent creator based on perceived evidence of [[intelligent design|deliberate design]] in the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |title=teleological argument |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/teleological_argument}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Francisco J. Ayala]] (2006), Review article of "The Blasphemy of Intelligent Design: Creationism's Trojan Horse. The Wedge of Intelligent Design" by Barbara Forrest; Paul R. Gross ''History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences'', Vol. 28, No. 3, pp. 409–421, {{JSTOR|23334140}}.: "The argument from design to demonstrate God's existence, now called the 'Intelligent Design' argument (ID) is a two-tined argument. The first prong asserts that the universe, humans, as well as all sorts of organisms, in their wholes, in their parts, and in their relations to one another and to their environment, appear to have been designed for serving certain functions and for certain ways of life. The second prong of the argument is that only an omnipotent Creator could account for the perfection and purposeful design of the universe and everything in it."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.princeton.edu/~grosen/puc/phi203/design.html |title=The Argument from Design |publisher= [[Princeton University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The earliest recorded versions of this argument are associated with [[Socrates]] in [[ancient Greece]], although it has been argued that he was taking up an older argument.&lt;ref name=comp&gt;Ahbel-Rappe, S. and Kamtekar, R., ''A Companion to Socrates'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009, p. 45. "Xenophon attributes to Socrates what is probably the earliest known natural theology, an argument for the existence of the gods from observations of design in the physical world."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007) agrees (p.&amp;nbsp;86), and cites other recent commentators who agree, and argues in detail that the argument reported by Xenophon and Plato is "at any rate the antecedent" of the argument from design (p.&amp;nbsp;213). He shows that the Stoics frequently paraphrased the account given by Xenophon.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]], his student, and [[Aristotle]], Plato's student, developed complex approaches to the proposal that the cosmos has an intelligent cause, but it was the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] who, under their influence, "developed the battery of creationist arguments broadly known under the label 'The Argument from Design{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="Sedley 2007, page xvii"&gt;Sedley 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abrahamic religion]]s have used the teleological argument in many ways, and has a long association with them. In the [[Middle Ages]], Islamic theologians such as [[Al-Ghazali]] used the argument, although it was rejected as unnecessary by [[Quran]]ic literalists, and as unconvincing by many [[Islamic philosophers]]. Later, the teleological argument was accepted by [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] and included as the fifth of his "[[Quinque viae|Five Ways]]" of proving the existence of God. In early modern England clergymen such as [[William Turner (naturalist)|William Turner]] and [[John Ray]] were well-known proponents. In the early 18th century, [[William Derham]] published his ''Physico-Theology'', which gave his "demonstration of the being and attributes of God from his works of creation".&lt;ref&gt;Derham, W., ''Physico-Theology'', 1713&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[William Paley]], in his 1802 ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]'' published a prominent presentation of the design argument with his version of the [[watchmaker analogy]] and the first use of the phrase "argument from design".&lt;ref name="Oxford English Dictionary"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary'' under "Design", substantive number 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

From its beginning, there have been numerous criticisms of the different versions of the teleological argument, and responses to its challenge to the claims against non-teleological natural science. Especially important were the general logical arguments made by [[David Hume]] in his ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]'', published 1779, and the explanation of biological complexity given in [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[Origin of Species]]'', published in 1859.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.be/books?id=Zp5pAgAAQBAJ The Oxford Handbook of Natural Theology], p.&amp;nbsp;3, for example: "Between them, so the story goes, Hume, Darwin and Barth pulled the rug out from underneath the pretensions of natural theology to any philosophical, scientific, or theological legitimacy".&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1960s, Paley's arguments, including the words "[[intelligent design]]", have been influential in the development of a [[creation science]] movement, especially the form known as the [[intelligent design movement]], which not only uses the teleological argument to argue against the modern scientific understanding of [[evolution]], but also makes the claim that supposed flaws in evolutionary science justify removing it from the educational curriculum.&lt;ref name="SM 07" /&gt;

Also starting already in classical Greece, two approaches to the teleological argument developed, distinguished by their understanding of whether the natural order was literally created or not. The non-creationist approach starts most clearly with Aristotle, although many thinkers, such as the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]], believed it was already intended by Plato. This approach is not creationist in a simple sense, because while it agrees that a cosmic intelligence is responsible for the natural order, it rejects the proposal that this requires a "creator" to physically make and maintain this order. The Neoplatonists did not find the teleological argument convincing, and in this they were followed by medieval philosophers such as [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]]. Later, [[Averroes]] and Thomas Aquinas considered the argument acceptable, but not necessarily the best argument.

Contemporary defenders of the teleological argument are [[Antony Flew]], [[Richard Swinburne]] and [[John Lennox]].

== History ==

While the concept of an intelligence behind the natural order is ancient, a rational argument that concludes that we can know that the natural world has a designer, or a creating intelligence which has human-like purposes, appears to have begun with [[classical philosophy]].&lt;ref name=comp /&gt; Religious thinkers in [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] also developed versions of the teleological argument. Later, variants on the argument from design were produced in [[Western philosophy]] and by [[Christian fundamentalism]].

=== Classical philosophy ===

====Socrates and the pre-Socratics====
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Plato and [[Aristotle]], depicted here in ''[[The School of Athens]]'', both developed philosophical arguments addressing the universe's apparent order (''[[logos]]'')]]

The argument from intelligent design appears to have begun with [[Socrates]], although the concept of a cosmic intelligence is older and [[David Sedley]] has argued that Socrates was developing an older idea, citing [[Anaxagoras of Clazomenae]], born about 500 BC, as a possible earlier proponent.&lt;ref name=mcpherr/&gt;&lt;ref name=ahbel/&gt;&lt;ref name=sed/&gt; The proposal that the order of nature showed evidence of having its own human-like "intelligence" goes back to the origins of Greek natural philosophy and science, and its attention to the orderliness of nature, often with special reference to the revolving of the heavens. Anaxagoras is the first person who is definitely known to have explained such a concept using the word "''[[nous]]''" (which is the original Greek term that leads to modern English "intelligence" via its Latin and French translations). Aristotle reports an earlier philosopher from [[Clazomenae]] named [[Hermotimus of Clazomenae|Hermotimus]] who had taken a similar position.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' I.4.[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Aristot.+Met.+1.984b 984b].&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst [[Pre-Socratic philosophers]] before Anaxagoras, other philosophers had proposed a similar intelligent ordering principle causing life and the rotation of the heavens. For example [[Empedocles]], like [[Hesiod]] much earlier, described cosmic order and living things as caused by a cosmic version of [[love]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}} Chapter X.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pythagoras]] and [[Heraclitus]] attributed the cosmos with "[[reason]]" (''[[logos]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Presocratic Philosophers|edition=second|last1=Kirk|last2=Raven|last3=Schofield|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1983}}. See pages 204 and 235.&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''[[Philebus]]'' 28c [[Plato]] has Socrates speak of this as a tradition, saying that "all philosophers agree—whereby they really exalt themselves—that mind (''nous'') is king of heaven and earth. Perhaps they are right." and later states that the ensuing discussion "confirms the utterances of those who declared of old that mind (''nous'') always rules the universe".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhileb.%3Apage%3D28 28c] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0174%3Atext%3DPhileb.%3Apage%3D30 30d]. Translation by Fowler.&lt;/ref&gt;

Xenophon's report in his ''[[Memorabilia (Xenophon)|Memorabilia]]'' might be the earliest clear account of an argument that there is evidence in nature of intelligent design.&lt;ref name=ahbel&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GKewlVwJ9rgC&amp;pg=PA27|page=27|title=Socrates: A Guide for the Perplexed| first=Sara |last=Ahbel-Rappe|isbn=9780826433251|date=2009-08-30}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The word traditionally translated and discussed as "design" is ''[[wikt:γνώμη|gnōmē]]'' and Socrates is reported by Xenophon to have pressed doubting young men to look at things in the market, and consider whether they could tell which things showed evidence of ''gnōmē'', and which seemed more to be by blind chance, and then to compare this to nature and consider whether it could be by blind chance.&lt;ref name=mcpherr&gt;{{citation|title=The Religion of Socrates| first=Mark |last= McPherran|year=1996|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nWfQx1CjZl0C&amp;pg=PA274&amp;dq=socrates+religion+%22intelligent+design%22#v=onepage&amp;q=socrates%20religion%20%22intelligent%20design%22&amp;f=false|publisher=The Pennsylvania State University Press| isbn=978-0271040325 }}, pp. 273–275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sed&gt;{{citation|title=Creationism and Its Critics in Antiquity|first=David|last=Sedley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgRuJEfzUG8C|year=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520934368}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In Plato's ''[[Phaedo]]'', Socrates is made to say just before dying that his discovery of Anaxagoras' concept of a cosmic ''nous'' as the cause of the order of things, was an important turning point for him. But he also expressed disagreement with Anaxagoras' understanding of the implications of his own doctrine, because of Anaxagoras' [[materialism|materialist]] understanding of [[Causality|causation]]. Socrates complained that Anaxagoras restricted the work of the cosmic ''nous'' to the beginning, as if it were uninterested and all events since then just happened because of causes like air and water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DPhaedo%3Apage%3D97 97]-[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170%3Atext%3DPhaedo%3Apage%3D98 98]. Also see Ahbel Rappe.&lt;/ref&gt; Socrates, on the other hand, apparently insisted that the demiurge must be "loving", particularly concerning humanity. (In this desire to go beyond Anaxagoras and make the cosmic ''nous'' a more active manager, Socrates was apparently preceded by [[Diogenes of Apollonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcoltxt|Ahbel-Rappe|2009}}, {{harvcoltxt|McPherran|1996|p=290}} and {{harvcoltxt|Kirk|Raven| Schofield|1983}}, chapter XVI.&lt;/ref&gt;)

====Plato and Aristotle====
Plato's ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]'' is presented as a description of someone who is explaining a "likely story" in the form of a myth, and so throughout history commentators have disagreed about which elements of the myth can be seen as the position of Plato.&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;132.&lt;/ref&gt; Sedley nevertheless calls it "the creationist manifesto" and points out that although some of Plato's followers denied that he intended it, in classical times writers such as Aristotle, Epicurus, the Stoics and Galen all understood Plato as proposing the world originated in an "intelligent creative act".&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;133.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato has a character explain the concept of a "[[demiurge]]" with supreme wisdom and intelligence as the creator of the cosmos in his work .

Plato's teleological perspective is also built upon the analysis of ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' order and structure in the world that he had already presented in ''[[Republic (dialogue)|The Republic]]''. The story does not propose creation ''[[ex nihilo]]''; rather, the demiurge made order from the chaos of the cosmos, imitating the eternal Forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/plato/ | title=Plato | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=April 21, 2005 | accessdate=November 12, 2011 | last1=Brickhouse | first1=Thomas | last2=Smith | first2=Nicholas D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hankinson|Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought}}

Plato's student and friend Aristotle (c. 384 – 322 BC), continued the Socratic tradition of criticising natural scientists such as [[Democritus]] who sought (as in modern science) to explain everything in terms of matter and chance motion. He was very influential in the future development of classical creationism, but was not a straightforward "creationist" because he required no creation interventions in nature, meaning he "insulated god from any requirement to intervene in nature, either as creator or as administrator".&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;204.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of direct intervention by a creator it is "scarcely an exaggeration to say that for Aristotle the entire functioning of the natural world, as also the heavens, is ultimately to be understood as a shared striving towards godlike [[actuality]]".&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;171.&lt;/ref&gt; And whereas the myth in the ''Timaeus'' suggests that all living things are based on one single paradigm, not one for each species, and even tells a story of "devolution" whereby other living things devolved from humans, it was Aristotle who presented the influential idea that each type of normal living thing must be based on a fixed paradigm or form for that species.&lt;ref name=sed/&gt;

Aristotle felt that biology was a particularly important example of a field where materialist natural science ignored information which was needed in order to understand living things well. For example birds use wings for the purpose of flight.&lt;ref name="HistAnimI2"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/history_anim.1.i.html#223 |title=History of Animals |author=Aristotle |at=I 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore the most complete explanation in regard to the natural, as well as the artificial, is for the most part teleological.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum1985"&gt;{{cite book |first=M.C. |last=Nussbaum |year=1985 |title=Aristotle's de Motu Animalium |series=Princeton paperbacks |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-02035-8 |lccn=77072132 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ISD05P7TcOAC&amp;lpg=PA60&amp;pg=PA60 |page=60,66,69–70,73–81,94–98,101}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, proposals that species had changed by chance survival of the fittest, similar to what is now called "[[natural selection]]", were already known to Aristotle, and he rejected these with the same logic.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PhysI2"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.1.i.html#130 |title=Physics|author=Aristotle |at=I 2 (¶15)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PartsAnimI1"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/parts_animals.1.i.html#100 |title=Parts of Animals |author=Aristotle |at=I 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross2004"&gt;{{cite book |first=D. |last=Ross |first2=J.L. |last2=Ackrill |year=2004 |title=Aristotle |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-32857-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=651Bg2-8xsEC&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;pg=PA80 |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HullRuse2007"&gt;{{cite book |first=D.L. |last=Hull |first2=M. |last2=Ruse |year=2007 |title=The Cambridge Companion to the Philosophy of Biology |series=Cambridge Companions to Philosophy |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-61671-3 |lccn=2006025898 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZOgg-x4UyIC&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;pg=PA174 |page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; He conceded that monstrosities (new forms of life) could come about by chance,&lt;ref name="PhysII8a"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html#530 |title=Physics|author=Aristotle |at=II 8 &amp;nbsp;(¶2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PhysII8b"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html#585 |title=Physics|author=Aristotle |at=II 8 &amp;nbsp;(¶5)}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he disagreed with those who ascribed all nature purely to chance&lt;ref name="PhysII8c"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html#604 |title=Physics|author=Aristotle |at=II 8 &amp;nbsp;(¶8)}}&lt;/ref&gt; because he believed science can only provide a general account of that which is normal, "always, or for the most part".&lt;ref name="PhysII8"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/physics.2.ii.html#522 |title=Physics|author=Aristotle |at=II 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between what is normal, or by nature, and what is "accidental", or not by nature, is important in Aristotle's understanding of nature. As pointed out by Sedley, "Aristotle is happy to say (''Physics'' II 8, 199a33-b4) without the slightest fear of blasphemy, crafts make occasional mistakes; therefore, by analogy, so can nature".&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007), p.&amp;nbsp;186.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle the changes which happen by nature are caused by their "[[formal cause]]s", and for example in the case of a bird's wings there is also a [[final cause]] which is the purpose of flying. He explicitly compared this to human technology:
{{quotation|If then what comes from art is for the sake of something, it is clear that what come from nature is too [...] This is clear most of all in the other animals, which do nothing by art, inquiry, or deliberation; for which reason some people are completely at a loss whether it is by intelligence or in some other way that spiders, ants, and such things work. [...] It is absurd to think that a thing does not happen for the sake of something if we do not see what sets it in motion deliberating. [...] This is most clear when someone practices medicine himself on himself; for nature is like that.|Aristotle, Physics, II 8.&lt;ref&gt;Sachs translation (1998), ''Aristotle's physics; a guided study'', 2nd ed., pages 67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The question of how to understand Aristotle's conception of nature having a purpose and direction something like human activity is controversial in the details. [[Martha Nussbaum]] for example has argued that in his biology this approach was practical and meant to show nature only being analogous to human art, explanations of an organ being greatly informed by knowledge of its essential function.&lt;ref name="Nussbaum1985"/&gt; Nevertheless, Nussbaum's position is not universally accepted. In any case, Aristotle was not understood this way by his followers in the Middle Ages, who saw him as consistent with monotheistic religion and a teleological understanding of all nature. Consistent with the medieval interpretation, in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'' and other works Aristotle clearly argued a case for their being one highest god or "[[prime mover theory|prime mover]]" which was the ultimate cause, though specifically not the material cause, of the eternal forms or natures which cause the natural order, including all living things. And he clearly refers to this entity having an [[active intellect|intellect]] that humans somehow share in, which helps humans see the true natures or forms of things without relying purely on sense perception of physical things, including living species. This understanding of nature, and Aristotle's arguments against materialist understandings of nature, were very influential in the Middle Ages in Europe. The idea of fixed species remained dominant in biology until Darwin, and a focus upon biology is still common today in teleological criticisms of modern science.

====Roman era====
It was the [[Stoicism|Stoics]] who "developed the battery of creationist arguments broadly known under the label 'The Argument from Design{{'"}}.&lt;ref name="Sedley 2007, page xvii"/&gt; Cicero (c. 106 – c. 43 BC) reported the teleological argument of the Stoics in ''De Natura Deorum (On the Nature of the Gods)'' Book II, which includes an early version of the watchmaker analogy, which was later developed by William Paley. He has one of the characters in the dialogue say:
{{Quotation|When you see a sundial or a water-clock, you see that it tells the time by design and not by chance. How then can you imagine that the universe as a whole is devoid of purpose and intelligence, when it embraces everything, including these artifacts themselves and their artificers?|Cicero|''De Natura Deorum''|II.34}}

Another very important classical supporter of the teleological argument was [[Galen]], whose compendious works were one of the major sources of medical knowledge until modern times, both in Europe and the medieval Islamic world. He was not a Stoic, but like them he looked back to the Socratics and was constantly engaged in arguing against atomists such as the Epicureans. Unlike Aristotle (who was however a major influence upon him), and unlike the Neoplatonists, he believed there was really evidence for something literally like the "demiurge" found in Plato's ''Timaeus'', which worked physical upon nature. In works such as his ''On the Usefulness of Parts'' he explained evidence for it in the complexity of animal construction. His work shows "early signs of contact and contrast between the pagan and the Judaeo-Christian tradition of creation", criticizing the account found in the Bible. "Moses, he suggests, would have contented himself with saying that God ordered the eyelashes not to grow and that they obeyed. In contrast to this, the Platonic tradition's Demiurge is above all else a technician." Surprisingly, neither Aristotle nor Plato, but Xenophon are considered by Galen, as the best writer on this subject. Galen shared with Xenophon a scepticism of the value of books about most speculative philosophy, except for inquiries such as whether there is "something in the world superior in power and wisdom to man". This he saw as having an everyday importance, a usefulness for living well. He also asserted that Xenophon was the author who reported the real position of Socrates, including his aloofness from many types of speculative science and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Sedley (2007) ''Epilogue''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Galen's connection of the teleological argument to discussions about the complexity of living things, and his insistence that this is possible for a practical scientist, foreshadows some aspects of modern uses of the teleological argument.

===Medieval philosophy and theology===

====Late classical Christian writers====
As an appeal to [[general revelation]], [[Paul the Apostle]] (AD 5–67), argues in [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 1:18–20{{Bibleref2c-nb|Ro|1:18–20}}, that because it has been made plain to all from what has been created in the world, it is obvious that there is a God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Christian philosophy as natural theology |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/115240/Christianity/67536/Christian-philosophy-as-natural-theology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marcus Minucius Felix]] (c. late 2nd to 3rd century), an Early Christian writer, argued for the existence of God based on the analogy of an ordered house in his ''The Orders of Minucius Felix'': "Supposing you went into a house and found everything neat, orderly and well-kept, surely you would assume it had a master, and one
much better than the good things, his belongings ; so in this house of the universe, when throughout
heaven and earth you see the marks of foresight, order and law, may you not assume that the lord and
author of the universe is fairer than the stars themselves or than any portions of the entire world ?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Octavius of Minucius Felix | publisher=OrthodoxEbook | author=Marcus Minucius Felix | year=2010 | pages=359–361 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8OZqxbh23sQC&amp;lpg=PA360&amp;dq=Marcus%20Minucius%20Felix%20ordered%20house&amp;pg=PA359#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustine of Hippo]] (AD 354–430) in [[The City of God]] mentioned the idea that the world's "well-ordered changes and movements", and "the fair appearance of all visible things" was evidence for the world being created, and "that it could not have been created save by God".&lt;ref&gt;Augustine of Hippo, ''City of God'', Book XI, Chapter 4. "the world itself, by its well-ordered changes and movements, and by the fair appearance of all visible things, bears a testimony of its own, both that it has been created, and also that it could not have
been created save by God, whose greatness and beauty are unutterable and invisible."&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Islamic philosophy ====
Early Islamic philosophy played an important role in developing the philosophical understandings of God among Jewish and Christian thinkers in the Middle Ages, but concerning the teleological argument one of the lasting effects of this tradition came from its discussions of the difficulties which this type of proof has. Various forms of the argument from design have been used by Islamic theologians and philosophers from the time of the early [[Mutakallimun]] theologians in the 9th century, although it is rejected by fundamentalist or literalist schools, for whom the mention of God in the Qu'ran should be sufficient evidence. The argument from design was also seen as an unconvincing sophism by the early Islamic philosopher [[Al-Farabi]], who instead took the "emanationist" approach of the Neoplatonists such as Plotinus, whereby nature is rationally ordered, but God is not like a craftsman who literally manages the world. Later, [[Avicenna]] was also convinced of this, and proposed instead a cosmological argument for the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Avicenna |first=Lenn Evan |last=Goodman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=779JPlxYtGoC&amp;pg=PA63| page=63| publisher= Cornell university press| year=1992|isbn=978-0801472541 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The argument was however later accepted by both the Aristotelian philosopher [[Averroes]] (Ibn Rushd) and his great anti-philosophy opponent [[Al-Ghazali]]. Averroes' term for the argument was ''Dalīl al-ˁināya'', which can be translated as "argument from providence". Both of them however accepted the argument ''because'' they believed it is explicitly mentioned in the [[Quran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Kitāb al-Dalīl al-Kabīr| editor-first= Binyāmîn |editor-last=Abrahamov |chapter=Introduction| first=Binyāmîn |last=Abrahamov |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SYqKHJFAhr8C |year=1990| publisher=Brill| isbn= 978-9004089853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, like Aristotle, the Neoplatonists, and Al-Farabi, Averroes proposed that order and continual motion in the world is caused by God's intellect. Whether Averroes was an "emanationist" like his predecessors has been a subject of disagreement and uncertainty. But it is generally agreed that what he adapted from those traditions, agreed with them about the fact that God does not create in the same way as a craftsman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Averroes and the metaphysics of causation | publisher=SUNY Press | author=Kogan, Barry S. | year=1985 | pages=240–243 | isbn=978-0-88706-063-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lAyv0Ayy-R0C&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=teleological%20argument%20averroes&amp;pg=PA240#v=snippet&amp;q=teleological%20argument&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Catarina Carriço Marques de Moura Belo ''[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b4Nii9xOmTYC Chance and Determinism in Avicenna and Averroës]''. See for example p.&amp;nbsp;194.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact then, Averroes treated the teleological argument as one of two "religious" arguments for the existence of God. The principal demonstrative proof is, according to Averroes, Aristotle's proof from motion in the universe that there must be a first mover which causes everything else to move.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlos Fraenkel]] "Philosophical Religions from Plato to Spinoza: Reason, Religion, and Autonomy", p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2wYgAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199 199].&lt;/ref&gt; Averroes' position that the most logically valid proof should be physical rather than metaphysical (because then metaphysics would be proving itself) was in conscious opposition to the position of Avicenna. Later Jewish and Christian philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas were aware of this debate, and generally took a position closer to Avicenna.

====Jewish philosophy====
An example of the teleological argument in [[Jewish philosophy]] appears when the medieval Aristotelian philosopher [[Maimonides]] cites the passage in [[Isaiah]] 40:26, where the "Holy One" says: "Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things, that bringeth out their host by number:"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+40%3A26&amp;version=AKJV King James Version of the Bible]
&lt;/ref&gt; However, Barry Holtz calls this "a crude form of the argument from design", and that this "is only one possible way of reading the text". He asserts that "Generally, in the biblical texts the existence of God is taken for granted."&lt;ref&gt;Holtz, B., ''Back to the Sources'', Simon and Schuster, 2008, p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maimonides also recalled that [[Abraham]] (in the [[midrash]], or explanatory text, of [[Genesis Rabbah]] 39:1) recognized the existence of "one transcendent deity from the fact that the world around him exhibits an order and design".&lt;ref name=Koch/&gt; The [[midrash]] makes an analogy between the obviousness that a building has an owner, and that the world is looked after by God. Abraham says "Is it conceivable that the world is without a guide?"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/RabbaGenesis/midrashrabbahgen027557mbp#page/n359/mode/2up ''Genesis Rabbah'', 39:1]
&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these examples, the 19th century philosopher [[Nachman Krochmal]] called the argument from design "a cardinal principle of the Jewish faith".&lt;ref name=Koch&gt;Harris, J.M., ''Nachman Krochmal: Guiding the Perplexed of the Modern Age'', NYU Press, 1991, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American orthodox rabbi, [[Aryeh Kaplan]], retells a legend about the 2nd century AD [[Rabbi Meir]]. When told by a philosopher that he did not believe that the world was created by God, the rabbi produced a beautiful poem that he claimed had come into being when a cat accidentally knocked over a pot of ink, "spilling ink all over the document. This poem was the result." The philosopher exclaims that would be impossible: "There must be an author. There must be a scribe." The rabbi concludes, "How could the universe ... come into being by itself? There must be an Author. There must be a Creator."&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, A., ''The Aryeh Kaplan Anthology: Illuminating Expositions on Jewish Thought and Practice by a Revered Teacher'', Volume 1, Mesorah Publications, 1991, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Thomism ====
[[File:St-thomas-aquinas.jpg|thumb|upright|The fifth of Thomas Aquinas' proofs of God's existence was based on teleology]]

Thomas Aquinas (1225–1274), whose writings became widely accepted within Catholic western Europe, was heavily influenced by Aristotle, Averroes, and other Islamic and Jewish philosophers. He presented a teleological argument in his ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. In the work, Aquinas presented five ways in which he attempted to prove the existence of God: the ''[[quinque viae]]''. These arguments feature only ''a posteriori'' arguments, rather than literal reading of holy texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Thought of Thomas Aquinas | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Davies, Brian | year=1992 | page=30, footnote 30 | isbn=978-0-19-152044-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TxrDzeKU2VsC&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=aquinas%20teleological%20argument%20aristotle&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q=aquinas%20teleological%20argument%20aristotle&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He sums up his teleological argument as follows:

{{Quote|The fifth way is taken from the governance of the world. We see that things which lack knowledge, such as natural bodies, act for an end, and this is evident from their acting always, or nearly always, in the same way, so as to obtain the best result. Hence it is plain that they achieve their end, not fortuitously, but designedly. Now whatever lacks knowledge cannot move towards an end, unless it be directed by some being endowed with knowledge and intelligence; as the arrow is directed by the archer. Therefore, some intelligent being exists by whom all natural things are directed to their end; and this being we call God. |St Thomas Aquinas|''Summa Theologica: Article 3, Question 2)''&lt;ref name="Himma"&gt;Himma, Kenneth Einar (2006).

Aquinas notes that the existence of [[final cause]]s, by which a cause is directed toward an effect, can only be explained by an appeal to intelligence. However, as natural bodies aside from humans do not possess intelligence, there must, he reasons, exist a being that directs final causes at every moment. That being is what we call God.&lt;ref name="Himma" /&gt;

==== Newton and Leibniz ====
[[Isaac Newton]] affirmed his belief in the truth of the argument when, in 1713, he wrote these words in an appendix to the second edition of his [[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;This most elegant system of the sun, planets, and comets could not have arisen without the design and dominion of an intelligent and powerful being.&lt;ref&gt;Newton, I., quoted in Huyssteen, JWV. (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Science and Religion'', Macmillan, 2003, p. 621.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;This view, that "God is known from his works", was supported and popularized by Newton's friends [[Richard Bentley]], [[Samuel Clarke]] and [[William Whiston]] in the [[Boyle lectures]], which Newton supervised.&lt;ref&gt;Leshem, A., ''Newton on Mathematics and Spiritual Purity'', Springer, 2003, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Newton wrote to Bentley, just before Bentley delivered the first lecture, that:&lt;blockquote&gt;when I wrote my treatise about our Systeme I had an eye upon such Principles as might work with considering men for the beliefe [sic] of a Deity, and nothing can rejoice me more than to find it useful for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Leshem, A., ''Newton on Mathematics and Spiritual Purity'', Springer, 2003, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The German philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] disagreed with Newton's view of design in the teleological argument. In the [[Leibniz–Clarke correspondence]], Samuel Clarke argued Newton's case that God constantly intervenes in the world to keep His design adjusted, while Leibniz thought that the universe was created in such a way that God would not need to intervene at all. As quoted by Ayval Leshem, Leibniz wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;According to [Newton's] doctrine, God Almighty wants [i.e. needs] to wind up his watch from time to time; otherwise it would cease to move. He had not it seems, sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion&lt;ref&gt;Leshem, A., ''Newton on Mathematics and Spiritual Purity'', Springer, 2003, pp. 21–22.[https://books.google.com/books?id=fD-qvJp0Q5kC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=argument+from+design+%22Samuel+Clarke%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=h_xkU8jdEc7vOa7pgfAL&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=argument%20from%20design%20%22Samuel%20Clarke%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Leibniz considered the argument from design to have "only moral certainty" unless it was supported by his own idea of [[pre-established harmony]] expounded in his [[Monadology]].&lt;ref&gt;Pomerlaeau, ''Western Philosophies Religion'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 1998, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote that "The proof from the pre-established harmony is a particular form of the so-called physico-theological proof, otherwise known as the argument from design." According to Leibniz, the universe is completely made from individual substances known as [[monad (philosophy)|monads]], programmed to act in a predetermined way.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'': "monads are basic substances that make up the universe but lack spatial extension and hence are immaterial. Each monad is a unique, indestructible, dynamic, soullike entity whose properties are a function of its perceptions and appetites."&lt;/ref&gt; Russell wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;In Leibniz's form, the argument states that the harmony of all the monads can only have arisen from a common cause. That they should all exactly synchronize, can only be explained by a Creator who pre-determined their synchronism.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, B., ''A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of Leibniz,'', Routledge, 2005, First published 1900, p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== British empiricists ====

The 17th-century [[Dutch people|Dutch]] writers [[Lessius]] and [[Grotius]] argued that the intricate structure of the world, like that of a house, was unlikely to have arisen by chance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = James|last= Franklin | title = The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal| publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | year = 2001| location = Baltimore| pages = 244–5| isbn = 978-0-8018-6569-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The empiricist [[John Locke]], writing in the late 17th century, developed the Aristotelian idea that, excluding geometry, all science must attain its knowledge ''a posteriori'' - through sensual experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Cambridge companion to Locke | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Claiborne Chappell, Vere | year=1994 | pages=161–164 | isbn=978-0-521-38772-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f28fFbiohXMC&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=locke%20a%20priori&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q=locke%20a%20priori&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Locke, Anglican Irish Bishop [[George Berkeley]] advanced a form of [[idealism]] in which things only continue to exist when they are perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Berkeley's Idealism: A Critical Examination | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Dicker, Georges | year=2011 | page=260 | isbn=978-0-19-538146-7 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=XBqQXI3JGeEC&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;dq=teleological%20argument%20berkeley&amp;pg=PA260#v=onepage&amp;q=teleological%20argument%20berkeley&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; When humans do not perceive objects, they continue to exist because God is perceiving them. Therefore, in order for objects to remain in existence, God must exist omnipresently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/berkeley/ | title=George Berkeley | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=November 17, 2011 | author=Downing, Lisa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Hume, in the mid-18th century, referred to the teleological argument in his ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]''. Here, he appears to give his support to the argument from design. John Wright notes that "Indeed, he claims that the whole thrust of his analysis of causality in the Treatise supports the Design argument", and that, according to Hume, "we are obliged 'to infer an infinitely perfect Architect.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;Wright, JP., in Traiger, S., ''The Blackwell Guide to Hume's Treatise'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, later he was more critical of the argument in his ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''. This was presented as a dialogue between Hume and "a friend who loves sceptical paradoxes", where the friend gives a version of the argument by saying of its proponents, they "paint in the most magnificent colours the order, beauty, and wise arrangement of the universe; and then ask if such a glorious display of intelligence could come from a random coming together of atoms, or if chance could produce something that the greatest genius can never sufficiently admire."&lt;ref&gt;Pomerleau, WP., ''Twelve Great Philosophers: A Historical Introduction to Human Nature'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1997, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume also presented arguments both for and against the teleological argument in his ''[[Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion]]''. The character Cleanthes, summarizing the teleological argument, likens the universe to a man-made machine, and concludes by the principle of similar effects and similar causes that it must have a designing intelligence:
{{quotation|Look round the world: contemplate the whole and every part of it: You will find it to be nothing but one great-machine, subdivided into an infinite number of lesser machines, which again admit of subdivisions to a degree beyond what human senses and faculties can trace and explain. All these various machines, and even their most minute parts, are adjusted to each other with an accuracy, which ravishes into admiration all men who have ever contemplated them. The curious adapting of means to ends, throughout all nature, resembles exactly, though it much exceeds, the productions of human contrivance; of human design, thought, wisdom, and intelligence. Since therefore the effects resemble each other, we are led to infer, by all the rules of analogy, that the causes also resemble; and that the Author of Nature is somewhat similar to the mind of man; though possessed of much larger faculties, proportioned to the grandeur of the work which he has executed. By this argument ''a posteriori,'' and by this argument alone, do we prove at once the existence of a Deity, and his similarity to human mind and intelligence.&lt;ref name="Hume1779" /&gt;}}
On the other hand, Hume's sceptic, Philo, is not satisfied with the argument from design. He attempts a number of refutations, including one that arguably foreshadows Darwin's theory, and makes the point that if God resembles a human designer, then assuming divine characteristics such as omnipotence and omniscience is not justified. He goes on to joke that far from being the perfect creation of a perfect designer, this universe may be "only the first rude essay of some infant deity... the object of derision to his superiors".&lt;ref name="Hume1779"&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Hume |year=1779 |title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion |edition=The Second |location=London |publisher=[[Sine nomine|s.n.]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7dbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA111 |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Derham's natural theology ====
Starting in 1696 with his ''Artificial Clockmaker'', [[William Derham]] published a stream of teleological books. The best known of these are ''Physico-Theology'', 1713; ''Astro-Theology'', 1714; and ''Christo-Theology'', 1730. ''Physico-Theology'', for example, was explicitly subtitled "A demonstration of the being and attributes of God from his works of creation". A [[Natural theology|natural theologian]], Derham listed scientific observations of the many variations in nature, and proposed that these proved "the unreasonableness of infidelity". At the end of the section on Gravity for instance, he writes: "What else can be concluded, but that all was made with manifest Design, and that all the whole Structure is the Work of some intelligent Being; some Artist, of Power and Skill equivalent to such a Work?"&lt;ref&gt;Derham, W., ''Physico-Theology'', 1713, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, of the "sense of sound" he writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For who but an intelligent Being, what less than an omnipotent and infinitely wise God could contrive, and make such a fine Body, such a Medium, so susceptible of every Impression, that the Sense of Hearing hath occasion for, to empower all Animals to express their Sense and Meaning to others.&lt;ref&gt;Derham, W., ''Physico-Theology'', 1713, pp. 131–132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Derham concludes: "For it is a Sign a Man is a wilful, perverse Atheist, that will impute so glorious a Work, as the Creation is, to any Thing, yea, a mere Nothing (as Chance is) rather than to God.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/Physico_theology_Or_A_Demonstration_of_t.html?id=6Tm2CZLTl0wC Derham, W., ''Physico-Theology'', 1713, p. 328]&lt;/ref&gt; A.S. Weber writes that Derham's ''Physico-Theology'' "directly influenced" William Paley's later work.&lt;ref&gt;Weber, AS., ''Nineteenth-Century Science: An Anthology'', Broadview Press, 2000, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The power, and yet the limitations, of this kind of reasoning is illustrated in microcosm by the history of [[La Fontaine's Fables|La Fontaine's]] fable of [[The Acorn and the Pumpkin]], which first appeared in France in 1679. The light-hearted anecdote of how a doubting peasant is finally convinced of the wisdom behind creation arguably undermines this approach.&lt;ref&gt;Peter France, "The poet as a teacher" in ''Poetry in France: metamorphoses of a muse'', Edinburgh U 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;138&lt;/ref&gt; However, beginning with [[Anne Finch, Countess of Winchilsea|Anne Finch]]'s conversion of the story into a polemic against atheism, it has been taken up by a succession of moral writers as presenting a valid argument for the proposition that "The wisdom of God is displayed in creation".&lt;ref&gt;''Anecdotes and Examples illustrating the Catholic catechism'', New York 1904, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=--ELAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=%22the%20acorn%20and%20the%20pumpkin%22&amp;pg=PA39#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20acorn%20and%20the%20pumpkin%22&amp;f=false pp.&amp;nbsp;39–40]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Watchmaker analogy ====
[[File:WilliamPaley.jpg|thumb|[[William Paley]] popularized the "watchmaker analogy" used by earlier [[natural theology|natural theologians]], making it a famous teleological argument.]]
{{main|Watchmaker analogy}}

The [[watchmaker analogy]], framing the teleological argument with reference to a timepiece, dates at least back to the Stoics, who were reported by Cicero in his ''[[De Natura Deorum]]'' (II.88), using such an argument against [[Epicureans]], whom, they taunt, would "think more highly of the achievement of [[Archimedes]] in making a model of the revolutions of the firmament than of that of nature in creating them, although the perfection of the original shows a craftsmanship many times as great as does the counterfeit".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=De natura deorum| url= https://archive.org/details/denaturadeorumac00ciceuoft| year=1933| publisher= London W. Heinemann}}, translated by H. Rackham. This is discussed at Sedley p.&amp;nbsp;207.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used by [[Robert Hooke]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hooke | first = Rober |title = Micrographia | publisher = Courier Dover Publications | year = 2003 |page = 2 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=0DYXk_9XX38C | isbn = 978-0-486-49564-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Voltaire]], the latter of whom remarked:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
The Universe troubles me, and much less can I think
That this clock exists and should have no clockmaker.&lt;ref&gt;Translation from ''Aristotle to Darwin and Back Again: A Journey in Final Causality, Species, and Evolution'' Etienne Gilson Ignatius Press, 2009 p. 126. Original: "L'univers m'embarrasse, et je ne puis songer Que cette horloge existe, et n'ait point d'horloger"; {{cite book | last = Voltaire | authorlink =Voltaire | title = Les cabales,: oeuvre pacifique | publisher = Oxford University, s. n., 1772  | location = | page = 9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ai8HAAAAQAAJ&amp;dq=Les%20Cabales%20Oeuvre%20Pacifique&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q=point%20d%27horloger&amp;f=false | doi = | isbn = 978-1-165-51896-8 | year = 1772}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William Paley]] presented his version of the watchmaker analogy at the start of his ''Natural Theology'' (1802).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Paley|1809|p=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=A142&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=7 1].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[S]uppose I found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place, I should hardly think … that, for anything I knew, the watch might have always been there. Yet why should not this answer serve for the watch as well as for [a] stone [that happened to be lying on the ground]?… For this reason, and for no other; namely, that, if the different parts had been differently shaped from what they are, if a different size from what they are, or placed after any other manner, or in any order than that in which they are placed, either no motion at all would have been carried on in the machine, or none which would have answered the use that is now served by it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[Alister McGrath]], Paley argued that "The same complexity and utility evident in the design and functioning of a watch can also be discerned in the natural world. Each feature of a biological organism, like that of a watch, showed evidence of being designed in such a way as to adapt the organism to survival within its environment. Complexity and utility are observed; the conclusion that they were designed and constructed by God, Paley holds, is as natural as it is correct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Darwinism and the Divine: Evolutionary Thought and Natural Theology | author = McGrath, AE. | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons | year =  2011 | page = 94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural theology strongly influenced British science, with the expectation as expressed by [[Adam Sedgwick]] in 1831 that truths revealed by science could not conflict with the moral truths of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, E. Janet (1995), ''Charles Darwin: vol. 1 Voyaging'', London: Jonathan Cape, {{ISBN|1-84413-314-1}}, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; These natural philosophers saw God as the first cause, and sought secondary causes to explain design in nature: the leading figure Sir [[John Herschel]] wrote in 1836 that by analogy with other [[Physical law|intermediate causes]] "the origination of fresh species, could it ever come under our cognizance, would be found to be a natural in contradistinction to a miraculous process".&lt;ref name=hersch&gt;Wyhe, John van. (2007) ''Mind the gap: Did Darwin avoid publishing his theory for many years?''. Notes and Records of the Royal Society 61: 177–205. p. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A544&amp;pageseq=21 197]&lt;br /&gt;Babbage, Charles (1838) ''The Ninth Bridgewater Treatise''. 2nd edn. London: John Murray. pp. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=A25&amp;pageseq=232 225–227]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a theology student, [[Charles Darwin]] found Paley's arguments compelling. However, he later developed his theory of [[evolution]] in his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', which offers an alternate explanation of biological order. In his autobiography, Darwin wrote that "The old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1958|pp=[http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=61 59], [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F1497&amp;pageseq=89 87].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin struggled with the [[problem of evil]] and of suffering in nature, but remained inclined to believe that nature depended upon "designed laws" and commended [[Asa Gray]]'s statement about "Darwin's great service to Natural Science in bringing back to it Teleology: so that, instead of Morphology versus Teleology, we shall have Morphology wedded to Teleology."&lt;ref name="SMiles"&gt;Miles, Sara Joan, "[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/2001/PSCF9-01Miles.html Charles Darwin and Asa Gray Discuss Teleology and Design]," ''PSCF'' (2001) 53: 196–201.&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin owned he was "bewildered" on the subject, but was "inclined to look at everything as resulting from designed laws, with the details, whether good or bad, left to the working out of what we may call chance":
&lt;blockquote&gt;But I own that I cannot see, as plainly as others do, &amp; as I shd wish to do, evidence of design &amp; beneficence on all sides of us. There seems to me too much misery in the world. I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent &amp; omnipotent God would have designedly created the Ichneumonidae with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of caterpillars, or that a cat should play with mice. Not believing this, I see no necessity in the belief that the eye was expressly designed.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. ''More Letters of Charles Darwin'', ed. Francis Darwin, (New York: D. Appleton and Company, 1903), p. 252. Quoted in Miles, Sara Joan, "[http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/2001/PSCF9-01Miles.html Charles Darwin and Asa Gray Discuss Teleology and Design]," ''PSCF'' (2001) 53: 196–201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Recent proponents===

====Probabilistic arguments====
In 1928 and 1930, [[Frederick Robert Tennant|F. R. Tennant]] published his ''Philosophical Theology'', which was a "bold endeavour to combine scientific and theological thinking".&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Article on Tennant, Frederick Robert.&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed a version of the teleological argument based on the accumulation of the probabilities of each individual biological adaptation. "Tennant concedes that naturalistic accounts such as evolutionary theory may explain each of the individual adaptations he cites, but he insists that in this case the whole exceeds the sum of its parts: naturalism can explain each adaptation but not their totality."&lt;ref name=Rout/&gt; The ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' notes that "Critics have insisted on focusing on the cogency of each piece of theistic evidence – reminding us that, in the end, ten leaky buckets hold no more water than one." Also, "Some critics, such as [[John Hick]] and D.H. Mellor, have objected to Tennant's particular use of probability theory and have challenged the relevance of any kind of probabilistic reasoning to theistic belief."&lt;ref name=Rout&gt;Craig, E., ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy", Taylor &amp; Francis, 1998, Entry for "Tennant, Frederick Robert (1866–1957)."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Richard Swinburne]]'s "contributions to philosophical theology have sought to apply more sophisticated versions of probability theory to the question of God's existence, a methodological improvement on Tennant's work but squarely in the same spirit".&lt;ref name=Rout/&gt; He uses [[Bayesian probability]] "taking account not only of the order and functioning of nature but also of the 'fit' between human intelligence and the universe, whereby one can understand its workings, as well as human aesthetic, moral, and religious experience".&lt;ref name=EB&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'', entry on "Christian philosophy".&lt;/ref&gt; Swinburne writes: "the existence of order in the world confirms the existence of God if and only if the existence of this order in the world is more probable if there is a God than if there is not. ... the probability of order of the right kind is very much greater if there is a God, and so that the existence of such order adds greatly to the probability that there is a God."&lt;ref&gt;Swinburne, R., ''The Existence of God'', Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; Swinburne acknowledges that his argument by itself may not give a reason to believe in the existence of God, but in combination with other arguments such as [[cosmological argument]]s and evidence from [[mystical experience]], he thinks it can.

While discussing Hume's arguments, [[Alvin Plantinga]] offered a probability version of the teleological argument in his book ''[[God and Other Minds]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every ''contingent'' object such that we know whether or not it was the product of intelligent design, ''was'' the product of intelligent design.

The universe is a contingent object.

So probably the universe is designed.&lt;ref&gt;Plantinga, A., ''God and Other Minds: A Study of the Rational Justification of Belief in God'', Cornell University Press, 1990, p.&amp;nbsp;104.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  
Following Plantinga, Georges Dicker produced a slightly different version in his book about [[Bishop Berkeley]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A. The world ... shows amazing teleological order.

B. All Objects exhibiting such order ... are products of intelligent design.

C. Probably the world is a result of intelligent design.

D. Probably, God exists and created the world.&lt;ref&gt;Dicker, G., ''Berkeley's Idealism: A Critical Examination'', Oxford University Press, 2011 p.&amp;nbsp;262. [https://books.google.com/books?id=5yVwAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=plantinga+++%22argument+from+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vqVWU-zUOIOrhAe36ICwBA&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=plantinga%20%20%20%22argument%20from%20design%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' has the following criticism of such arguments:&lt;blockquote&gt; It can of course be said that any form in which the universe might be is statistically enormously improbable as it is only one of a virtual infinity of possible forms. But its actual form is no more improbable, in this sense, than innumerable others. It is only the fact that humans are part of it that makes it seem so special, requiring a transcendent explanation.&lt;ref name=EB/&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Fine-tuned Universe ====
{{Main|Fine-tuned Universe}}
A modern variation of the teleological argument is built upon the concept of the [[fine-tuned Universe]]: According to the website ''Biologos'': "Fine-tuning refers to the surprising precision of nature's physical constants, and the beginning state of the Universe. To explain the present state of the universe, even the best scientific theories require that the physical constants of nature and the beginning state of the Universe have extremely precise values."&lt;ref name="biologos.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://biologos.org/questions/fine-tuning |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141221081439/http://biologos.org/questions/fine-tuning |archivedate=2014-12-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the fine-tuning of the Universe is the apparent delicate balance of conditions necessary for human life. In this view, speculation about a vast range of possible conditions in which life cannot exist is used to explore the probability of conditions in which life can and does exist. For example, it can be argued that if the force of the [[Big Bang]] explosion had been different by 1/10 to the sixtieth power or the [[strong interaction|strong interaction force]] was only 5% different, life would be impossible.&lt;ref name="Himma2009"/&gt;Renowned physicist Stephen Hawking estimates that "if the rate of the universe's expansion one second after the Big Bang had been smaller by even one part in a hundred thousand million million, the universe would have re-collapsed into a hot fireball due to gravitational attraction."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1086/323074|title=Constraints on the Long‐Range Properties of Gravity from Weak Gravitational Lensing|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=560|issue=2|pages=539–543|year=2001|last1=White|first1=Martin|last2=Kochanek|first2=C. S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of a teleological argument, the intuition in relation to a fine-tuned universe would be that God must have been responsible, if achieving such perfect conditions is so improbable.&lt;ref name="biologos.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Himma2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/design | title=Design Arguments for the Existence of God | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=12 April 2009 | accessdate=November 19, 2011 | author=Himma, Kenneth Einar}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in regard to fine-tuning, [[Kenneth Einar Himma]] writes: "The mere fact that it is enormously improbable that an event occurred... by itself, gives us no reason to think that it occurred by design ... As intuitively tempting as it may be..."&lt;ref name="Himma2009"/&gt; Himma attributes the "Argument from Suspicious Improbabilities", a formalization of "the fine-tuning intuition" to [[George N. Schlesinger]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;To understand Schlesinger's argument, consider your reaction to two different events. If John wins a 1-in-1,000,000,000 lottery game, you would not immediately be tempted to think that John (or someone acting on his behalf) cheated. If, however, John won three consecutive 1-in-1,000 lotteries, you would immediately be tempted to think that John (or someone acting on his behalf) cheated. Schlesinger believes that the intuitive reaction to these two scenarios is epistemically justified. The structure of the latter event is such that it… justifies a belief that intelligent design is the cause… Despite the fact that the probability of winning three consecutive 1-in-1,000 games is exactly the same as the probability of winning one 1-in-1,000,000,000 game, the former event… warrants an inference of intelligent design.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Himma considers Schlesinger's argument to be subject to the same vulnerabilities he noted in other versions of the design argument: &lt;blockquote&gt;While Schlesinger is undoubtedly correct in thinking that we are justified in suspecting design in the case [of winning] three consecutive lotteries, it is because—and only because—we know two related empirical facts about such events. First, we already know that there exist intelligent agents who have the right motivations and causal abilities to deliberately bring about such events. Second, we know from past experience with such events that they are usually explained by the deliberate agency of one or more of these agents. Without at least one of these two pieces of information, we are not obviously justified in seeing design in such cases… [T]he problem for the fine-tuning argument is that we lack both of the pieces that are needed to justify an inference of design. First, the very point of the argument is to establish the fact that there exists an intelligent agency that has the right causal abilities and motivations to bring the existence of a universe capable of sustaining life. Second, and more obviously, we do not have any past experience with the genesis of worlds and are hence not in a position to know whether the existence of fine-tuned universes are usually explained by the deliberate agency of some intelligent agency. Because we lack this essential background information, we are not justified in inferring that there exists an intelligent Deity who deliberately created a universe capable of sustaining life.&lt;ref name="Himma2009" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Creation science and intelligent design ====
{{Main|Intelligent design}}
A version of the argument from design is central to both [[creation science]] and [[Intelligent design]],&lt;ref name="SM 07" /&gt; but unlike Paley's openness to [[deism|deistic]] design through God-given laws, proponents seek scientific confirmation of repeated miraculous interventions in the history of life, and argue that their [[theistic science]] should be taught in science classrooms.&lt;ref name="PM 09"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Padian | first1 = K. | last2 = Matzke | first2 = N. | doi = 10.1042/bj20081534 | title = Darwin, Dover, 'Intelligent Design' and textbooks | journal = Biochemical Journal | volume = 417 | issue = 1 | pages = 29–42 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19061485| pmc = }} [http://www.biochemj.org/bj/417/0029/4170029.pdf .pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching of [[evolution]] was effectively barred from United States public school curricula by the outcome of the 1925 [[Scopes Trial]], but in the 1960s the [[National Defense Education Act]] led to the [[Biological Sciences Curriculum Study]] reintroducing the teaching of evolution. In response, there was a resurgence of [[creationism]], now presented as "creation science", based on biblical literalism but with Bible quotes optional. ("Explicit references to the Bible were optional: Morris's 1974 book ''Scientific Creationism'' came in two versions, one with Bible quotes, and one without."&lt;ref name="SM 07" /&gt;)

A 1989 survey found that virtually all literature promoting creation science presented the design argument, with [[John D. Morris]] saying "any living thing gives such strong evidence for design by an intelligent designer that only a willful ignorance of the data (II Peter 3:5) could lead one to assign such intricacy to chance." Such publications introduced concepts central to intelligent design, including ''[[irreducible complexity]]'' (a variant of the watchmaker analogy) and ''[[specified complexity]]'' (closely resembling a fine-tuning argument). The [[United States Supreme Court]] ruling on ''[[Edwards v. Aguillard]]'' barred the teaching of "Creation Science" in public schools because it breached the [[Separation of church and state in the United States|separation of church and state]], and a group of creationists rebranded Creation Science as "intelligent design" which was presented as a scientific theory rather than as a religious argument.&lt;ref name="SM 07"&gt;

Scientists disagreed with the assertion that intelligent design is scientific, and its introduction into the science curriculum of a [[Pennsylvania]] school district led to the 2005 ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'' trial, which ruled that the "intelligent design" arguments are essentially religious in nature and not science.&lt;ref name="Pigliucci2010"/&gt; The court took evidence from theologian [[John F. Haught]], and ruled that "ID is not a new scientific [[argument]], but is rather an old religious argument for the existence of God. He traced this argument back to at least Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century, who framed the argument as a syllogism: Wherever complex design exists, there must have been a designer; nature is complex; therefore nature must have had an intelligent designer." "This argument for the existence of God was advanced early in the 19th century by Reverend Paley": "The only apparent difference between the argument made by Paley and the argument for ID, as expressed by defense expert witnesses Behe and Minnich, is that ID's 'official position' does not acknowledge that the designer is God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court

Proponents of the [[intelligent design movement]] such as [[Cornelius G. Hunter]], have asserted that the methodological [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] upon which science is based is religious in nature.&lt;ref&gt;"Science's Blind Spot: The Unseen Religion of Scientific Naturalism". Grand Rapids, MI: Brazos Press, (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; They commonly refer to it as 'scientific materialism' or as 'methodological materialism' and conflate it with 'metaphysical naturalism'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/barbara_forrest/naturalism.html Methodological Naturalism and Philosophical Naturalism]: Clarifying the Connection (2000), [[Barbara Forrest]], Retrieved 2007-05-20.&lt;/ref&gt; They use this assertion to support their claim that modern science is atheistic, and contrast it with their preferred approach of a revived [[natural philosophy]] which welcomes supernatural explanations for natural phenomena and supports [[Theistic realism|theistic science]]. This ignores the distinction between science and religion, established in Ancient Greece, in which science can not use supernatural explanations.&lt;ref name="Pigliucci2010"&gt;{{cite book |first=Massimo |last=Pigliucci |year=2010 |title=Nonsense on Stilts: How to Tell Science from Bunk |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-66786-7 |lccn=2009049778 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aC8Baky2qTcC&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;pg=PA177 |page=177 |quote=[E]ven back in Aristotle's time, a fundamental assumption of doing things scientifically is that the supernatural is out: no explanations that invoke non-natural causes are allowed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelligent design advocate and [[biochemist]] [[Michael Behe]] proposed a development of Paley's watch analogy in which he argued in favour of intelligent design. Unlike Paley, Behe only attempts to prove the existence of an intelligent designer, rather than the God of classical theism. Behe uses the analogy of a mousetrap to propose [[irreducible complexity]]: he argues that if a mousetrap loses just one of its parts, it can no longer function as a mousetrap. He argues that irreducible complexity in an object guarantees the presence of intelligent design. Behe claims that there are instances of irreducible complexity in the natural world and that parts of the world must have been designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Arguing About Gods | publisher=Cambridge University Press | author=Oppy, Graham | year=2006 | pages=187–189 | isbn=978-0-521-86386-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DlVtfUxPD14C&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;vq=188&amp;dq=arguing%20about%20gods&amp;pg=PA187#v=snippet&amp;q=behe&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This negative argument against step by step evolution ignores longstanding evidence that evolution proceeds through [[exaptation|changes of function]] from preceding systems. The specific examples Behe proposes have been shown to have simpler [[Homology (biology)|homologues]] which could act as precursors with different functions. His arguments have been rebutted, both in general and in specific cases by numerous scientific papers{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}. In response, Behe and others, "ironically, given the absence of any detail in their own explanation, complain that the proffered explanations lack sufficient detail to be empirically tested."&lt;ref name="SM 07" /&gt;

==== "Third way" proposal ====

[[University of Chicago]] [[genetics|geneticist]] [[James A. Shapiro]], writing in the [[Boston Review]], states that advancements in genetics and molecular biology, and "the growing realization that cells have molecular computing networks which process information about internal operations and about the external environment to make decisions controlling growth, movement, and differentiation", have implications for the teleological argument. Shapiro states that these "[[natural genetic engineering]]" systems, can produce radical reorganizations of the "genetic apparatus within a single cell generation".&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;Shapiro, James, The Third Way, http://new.bostonreview.net/BR22.1/shapiro.html{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shapiro suggests what he calls a 'Third Way'; a non-creationist, non-Darwinian type of evolution:
{{quote|What significance does an emerging interface between biology and information science hold for thinking about evolution? It opens up the possibility of addressing scientifically rather than ideologically the central issue so hotly contested by fundamentalists on both sides of the Creationist-Darwinist debate: Is there any guiding intelligence at work in the origin of species displaying exquisite adaptations ...&lt;ref name=Shapiro /&gt;}}
In his book, ''Evolution: A View from the 21st Century'', Shapiro refers to this concept of "natural genetic engineering", which he says, has proved troublesome, because many scientists feel that it supports the intelligent design argument. He suggests that "function-oriented capacities [can] be attributed to cells", even though this is "the kind of teleological thinking that scientists have been taught to avoid at all costs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution: A View from the 21st Century|last=Shapiro|first=James|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2011|pages=136–137}}[https://books.google.com/books?id=T7-UgI_kgT8C&amp;dq=shapiro+creationism&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

===Classical===
The original development of the argument from design was in reaction to atomistic, explicitly non-teleological understandings of nature. Socrates, as reported by Plato and Xenophon, was reacting to such natural philosophers. While less has survived from the debates of the Hellenistic and Roman eras, it is clear from sources such as [[Cicero]] and [[Lucretius]], that debate continued for generations, and several of the striking metaphors used to still today such as the unseen watchmaker, and the [[infinite monkey theorem]], have their roots in this period. While the Stoics became the most well-known proponents of the argument from design, the atomistic counter arguments were refined most famously by the [[Epicurus|Epicureans]]. On the one hand, they criticized the evidence for there being evidence of an intelligent design to nature and the logic of the Stoics. On the defensive side, they were faced with the challenge of explaining how un-directed chance can cause something which appears to be a rational order. Much of this defence revolved around arguments such as the infinite monkey metaphor. Democritus had already apparently used such arguments at the time of Socrates, saying that there will be infinite planets, and only some having an order like the planet we know. But the Epicureans refined this argument, by proposing that the actual number of types of atoms in nature is small, not infinite, making it less coincidental that after a long period of time, certain orderly outcomes will result.&lt;ref name=sed/&gt;

These were not the only positions held in classical times. A more complex position also continued to be held by some schools, such as the Neoplatonists, who, like Plato and Aristotle, insisted that Nature did indeed have a rational order, but were concerned about how to describe the way in which this rational order is caused. According to Plotinus for example, Plato's metaphor of a craftsman should be seen only as a metaphor, and Plato should be understood as agreeing with Aristotle that the rational order in nature works through a form of causation unlike everyday causation. In fact, according to this proposal each thing already has its own nature, fitting into a rational order, whereby the thing itself is "in need of, and directed towards, what is higher or better".&lt;ref&gt;Riccardo Chiaradonna, "Plotinus' account of demiurgic causation and its philosophical background", in ''Causation and Creation in Late Antiquity'' edited by Anna Marmodoro, Brian D. Prince, [https://books.google.be/books?id=7Wt2BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA31 p.&amp;nbsp;31].&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Hume===
[[File:David Hume.jpg|thumb|David Hume outlined his criticisms of the teleological argument in his ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion''.]]
Louis Loeb writes that [[David Hume]], in his ''Enquiry'', "insists that inductive inference cannot justify belief in extended objects". Loeb also quotes Hume as writing:&lt;blockquote&gt;It is only when two species of objects are found to be constantly conjoined, that we can infer the one from the other ... If experience and observation and analogy be, indeed, the only guides which we can reasonably follow in inference of this nature; both the effect and cause must bear a similarity and resemblance to other effects and causes ... which we have found, in many instances, to be conjoined with another ... [The proponents of the argument] always suppose the universe, an effect quite singular and unparalleled, to be the proof of a Deity, a cause no less singular and unparalleled.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Loeb notes that "we observe neither God nor other universes, and hence no conjunction
involving them. There is no observed conjunction to ground an inference either
to extended objects or to God, as unobserved causes."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=6ECxW_2tAf0C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=%22insists+that+inductive%22+hume&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cLTzU-nZDYWf7AaRvoCIBw&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22insists%20that%20inductive%22%20hume&amp;f=false Loeb, LE., in Radcliffe, ES (ed.), ''A Companion to Hume'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010, p. 118.]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Hume also presented a criticism of the argument in his ''Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion''. The character ''Philo'', a religious sceptic, voices Hume's criticisms of the argument. He argues that the design argument is built upon a faulty analogy as, unlike with man-made objects, we have not witnessed the design of a universe, so do not know whether the universe was the result of design. Moreover, the size of the universe makes the analogy problematic: although our experience of the universe is of order, there may be chaos in other parts of the universe.&lt;ref name="IEP Hume"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/hume | title=David Hume (1711–1776) | publisher=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy | date=June 30, 2011 | accessdate=November 24, 2011 | author=Fiesar, James}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philo argues:
{{Quote|A very small part of this great system, during a very short time, is very imperfectly discovered to us; and do we thence pronounce decisively concerning the origin of the whole?|David Hume|Dialogues 2&lt;ref name="IEP Hume" /&gt;}}
Philo also proposes that the order in nature may be due to nature alone. If nature contains a principle of order within it, the need for a designer is removed. Philo argues that even if the universe is indeed designed, it is unreasonable to justify the conclusion that the designer must be an omnipotent, omniscient, benevolent God – the God of classical theism.&lt;ref name="IEP Hume" /&gt; It is impossible, he argues, to infer the perfect nature of a creator from the nature of its creation. Philo argues that the designer may have been defective or otherwise imperfect, suggesting that the universe may have been a poor first attempt at design.&lt;ref name="God Hypothesis"&gt;{{cite book | title=The God Hypothesis and Other Theories of the Universe | publisher=Infinity Publishing | author=Auerbach, Albert A. | year=2001 | pages=59–60 | isbn=978-0-7414-0245-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OtDSNNPjpRwC&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=teleological%20argument%20from%20ignorance&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=teleological%20argument%20from%20ignorance&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume also pointed out that the argument does not necessarily lead to the existence of one God: “why may not several deities combine in contriving and framing the world?” (p.&amp;nbsp;108).&lt;ref name="Hume1779" /&gt;

[[Wesley C. Salmon]] developed Hume's insights, arguing that all things in the universe which exhibit order are, to our knowledge, created by material, imperfect, finite beings or forces. He also argued that there are no known instances of an immaterial, perfect, infinite being creating anything. Using the probability calculus of [[Bayes Theorem]], Salmon concludes that it is very improbable that the universe was created by the type of intelligent being theists argue for.&lt;ref&gt;Wesley C. Salmon, "Religion and Science: A New Look at Hume's Dialogues", Philosophical Studies, 33 (1978), 143–176.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nancy Cartwright (philosopher)|Nancy Cartwright]] accuses Salmon of [[begging the question]]. One piece of evidence he uses in his probabilistic argument – that atoms and molecules are not caused by design – is equivalent to the conclusion he draws, that the universe is probably not caused by design. The atoms and molecules are what the universe is made up of and whose origins are at issue. Therefore, they cannot be used as evidence against the theistic conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF00571885 |jstor=4319204|title=Comments on Wesley Salmon's 'Science and Religion ...'|journal=Philosophical Studies|volume=33|issue=2|pages=177–183|year=1978|last1=Cartwright|first1=Nancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immanuel Kant===
Referring to it as the physico-theological proof, [[Immanuel Kant]] discussed the teleological argument in his [[Critique of Pure Reason]]. Even though he referred to it as "the oldest, clearest and most appropriate to human reason", he nevertheless rejected it, heading section VI with the words, "On the impossibility of a physico-theological proof".&lt;ref&gt;Buroker, JV., ''Kant's 'Critique of Pure Reason': An Introduction'', Cambridge University Press, p.&amp;nbsp;279.[https://books.google.com/books?id=2DaHzDGjR48C&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=kant+%22argument+from+design%22+criticism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZS5UU-qhB-nH7AaNsYHwAg&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22argument%20from%20design%22%20&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kant, I, ''Critique of Pure Reason'', in Guyer, P. and Wood, AW.(Trans.), CUP, 1998, p. 578.&lt;/ref&gt; In accepting some of Hume's criticisms, Kant wrote that the argument "proves at most intelligence only in the arrangement of the 'matter' of the universe, and hence the existence not of a 'Supreme Being', but of an 'Architect{{'"}}. Using the argument to try to prove the existence of God required "a concealed appeal to the [[Ontological argument]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rabitte, E., in Tweyman, S, (ed.), ''David Hume: Critical Assessments'', Volume 5, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1995, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Does not prove the existence of God ===
[[File:D'après Nicolas de Largillière, portrait de Voltaire (Institut et Musée Voltaire) -001.jpg|thumb|[[Voltaire]] argued that, at best, the teleological argument could only indicate the existence of a powerful, but not necessarily all-powerful or all-knowing, intelligence.]]

In his ''Traité de métaphysique'' [[Voltaire]] argued that, even if the argument from design could prove the existence of a powerful intelligent designer, it would not prove that this designer is God.&lt;ref name=Voltaire&gt;{{cite book | author = Voltaire | authorlink = Voltaire | others = trans.

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] questioned the existence of God, rejecting all rational arguments for God's existence (including the teleological argument) on the grounds that reason is inevitably accompanied by doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Words of Wisdom: Philosophy's Most Important Quotations And Their Meanings | publisher=Quercus | author=Southwell, Gareth | isbn=978-1-78087-092-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u9JWTes9fH0C&amp;lpg=PT325&amp;dq=S%C3%B8ren%20Kierkegaard%20%22teleological%20argument%22&amp;pg=PT325#v=onepage&amp;q=S%C3%B8ren%20Kierkegaard%20%22teleological%20argument%22&amp;f=false | date=2011-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed that the argument from design does not take into consideration future events which may serve to undermine the proof of God's existence: the argument would never finish proving God's existence.&lt;ref name="Kierkegaard"&gt;Søren Kierkegaard, ''Philosophical Fragments'' (1844).&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'', Kierkegaard writes:

{{Quotation|The works of God are such that only God can perform them. Just so, but where then are the works of the God? The works from which I would deduce his existence are not directly and immediately given. The wisdom in nature, the goodness, the wisdom in the governance of the world – are all these manifest, perhaps, upon the very face of things? Are we not here confronted with the most terrible temptations to doubt, and is it not impossible finally to dispose of all these doubts? But from such an order of things I will surely not attempt to prove God's existence; and even if I began I would never finish, and would in addition have to live constantly in suspense, lest something so terrible should suddenly happen that my bit of proof would be demolished.|Søren Kierkegaard|Philosophical Fragments&lt;ref name="Kierkegaard" /&gt;}}

=== Argument from improbability ===
[[Richard Dawkins]] is harshly critical of intelligent design in his book ''[[The God Delusion]].'' In this book, he contends that an appeal to intelligent design can provide no explanation for biology because it not only [[begs the question]] of the designer's own origin but raises additional questions: an intelligent designer must itself be far more complex and difficult to explain than anything it is capable of designing.&lt;ref name="dawkins2006"/&gt; He believes the chances of life arising on a planet like the Earth are many orders of magnitude less probable than most people would think, but the [[anthropic principle]] effectively counters skepticism with regard to improbability. For example Astronomer [[Fred Hoyle#Rejection of chemical evolution|Fred Hoyle]] suggested that potential for life on Earth was no more probable than a [[Boeing 747]] being assembled by a hurricane from the scrapyard. Dawkins argues that a one-time event is indeed subject to improbability but once under way, natural selection itself is nothing like random chance. Furthermore, he refers to his counter argument to the argument from improbability by that same name:&lt;ref name="dawkins2006"/&gt;

{{quotation|The argument from improbability is the big one. In the traditional guise of the argument from design, it is easily today's most popular argument offered in favour of the existence of God and it is seen, by an amazingly large number of theists, as completely and utterly convincing. It is indeed a very strong and, I suspect, unanswerable argument—but in precisely the opposite direction from the theist's intention. The argument from improbability, properly deployed, comes close to proving that God does ''not'' exist. My name for the statistical demonstration that God almost certainly does not exist is the Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit.

The creationist misappropriation of the argument from improbability always takes the same general form, and it doesn't make any difference ... [if called] 'intelligent design' (ID). Some observed phenomenon—often a living creature or one of its more complex organs, but it could be anything from a molecule up to the universe itself—is correctly extolled as statistically improbable. Sometimes the language of information theory is used: the Darwinian is challenged to explain the source all the information in living matter, in the technical sense of information content as a measure of improbability or 'surprise value'… However statistically improbable the entity you seek to explain by invoking a designer, the designer himself has got to be at least as improbable. God is the Ultimate Boeing 747.

... The whole argument turns on the familiar question 'Who made God?'... A designer God cannot be used to explain organized complexity because any God capable of designing anything would have to be complex enough to demand the same kind of explanation in his own right. God presents an infinite regress from which he cannot help us to escape. This argument… demonstrates that God, though not technically disprovable, is very very improbable indeed.&lt;ref name="dawkins2006"/&gt;|Richard Dawkins|The God Delusion}}

Dawkins considered the argument from improbability to be "much more powerful" than the teleological argument, or argument from design, although he sometimes implies the terms are used interchangeably. He paraphrases St. Thomas' teleological argument as follows: "Things in the world, especially living things, look as though they have been designed. Nothing that we know looks designed unless it is designed. Therefore there must have been a designer, and we call him God."&lt;ref name="dawkins2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |year=2006 |title=The God Delusion |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Co. |isbn=978-0-618-68000-9 |lccn=2006015506 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yq1xDpicghkC&amp;pg=PA103 |pages=103, 136–138, 162–166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Edward Feser]] has accused Dawkins of misunderstanding the teleological argument, particularly Aquinas' version.&lt;ref&gt;Feser, Edward, ''The Last Superstition'', St. Augustine Press 2008, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aei.org/publication/the-new-philistinism/ | title=The New Philistinism| date=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A flawed argument===
[[George H. Smith]], in his book ''Atheism: The Case Against God'', points out what he considers to be a flaw in the argument from design:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now consider the idea that nature itself is the product of design. How could this be demonstrated? Nature… provides the basis of comparison by which we distinguish between designed objects and natural objects. We are able to infer the presence of design only to the extent that the characteristics of an object differ from natural characteristics. Therefore, to claim that nature as a whole was designed is to destroy the basis by which we differentiate between artifacts and natural objects.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, GH., ''Atheism: The Case Against God'', Prometheus Books, 2003, p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Perception of purpose in biology ===
{{main|Teleology in biology}}

The [[philosophy of biology|philosopher of biology]] [[Michael Ruse]] has argued that Darwin treated the structure of organisms as if they had a purpose: "the organism-as-if-it-were-designed-by God picture was absolutely central to Darwin's thinking in 1862, as it always had been."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Darwin and Design: Does Evolution Have a Purpose? | publisher=Harvard University Press | author=Ruse, Michael | year=2003 | pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to this as "the metaphor of design ... Organisms give the appearance of being designed, and thanks to Charles Darwin's discovery of natural selection we know why this is true." In his review of Ruse's book, R.J. Richards writes, "Biologists quite routinely refer to the design of organisms and their traits, but properly speaking it's ''apparent'' design to which they refer – an 'as if' design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://home.uchicago.edu/~rjr6/articles/Richards%20on%20Ruse.pdf | title=Michael Ruse's Design for Living | author=Richards, Robert J. | journal=Journal of the History of Biology | year=2004 | volume=37 | pages=25–38 | doi=10.1023/b:hist.0000020388.99933.5b}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Foley (academic)|Robert Foley]] refers to this as "the illusion of purpose, design, and progress". He adds, "there is no purpose in a fundamentally causative manner in evolution but that the processes of selection and adaptation give the illusion of purpose through the utter functionality and designed nature of the biological world."&lt;ref&gt;Foley, RA., in Morris, SC., ''The Deep Structure of Biology: Is Convergence Sufficiently Ubiquitous to Give a Directional Signal'', Templeton Foundation Press, 2008 p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Richard Dawkins suggests that while biology can at first seem to be purposeful and ordered, upon closer inspection its true function becomes questionable. Dawkins rejects the claim that biology serves any designed function, claiming rather that biology only mimics such purpose. In his book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', Dawkins states that animals are the most complex things in the known universe: "Biology is the study of complicated things that give the appearance of having been designed for a purpose." He argues that natural selection should suffice as an explanation of biological complexity without recourse to divine provenance.&lt;ref name="Dawkins1986"&gt;{{cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |year=1986 |title=The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe without Design |publisher=Norton |isbn=978-0-393-31570-7 |lccn=96229669 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPpaZnZMDG0C&amp;pg=PA1 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, theologian [[Alister McGrath]] has pointed out that the fine-tuning of carbon is even responsible for nature's ability to tune itself to any degree.&lt;blockquote&gt;[The entire biological] evolutionary process depends upon the unusual chemistry of carbon, which allows it to bond to itself, as well as other elements, creating highly complex molecules that are stable over prevailing terrestrial temperatures, and are capable of conveying genetic information (especially DNA). ... Whereas it might be argued that nature creates its own fine-tuning, this can only be done if the primordial constituents of the universe are such that an evolutionary process can be initiated. The unique chemistry of carbon is the ultimate foundation of the capacity of nature to tune itself.&lt;ref name="biologos.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McGrath|first1=Alister E.|title=A fine-tuned universe: the quest for God in science and theology|date=2009|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, KY.|isbn=978-0664233105|page=176|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proponents of [[intelligent design]] creationism, such as [[William A. Dembski]] question the philosophical assumptions made by critics with regard to what a designer would or would not do. Dembski claims that such arguments are not merely beyond the purview of science: often they are tacitly or overtly theological while failing to provide a serious analysis of the hypothetical objective's relative merit. Some critics, such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]] suggest that any purported 'cosmic' designer would only produce optimal designs, while there are numerous biological criticisms to demonstrate that such an ideal is manifestly untenable. Against these ideas, Dembski characterizes both Dawkins' and Gould's argument as a rhetorical [[straw man]].&lt;ref name="Dembski2004"/&gt; He suggests a principle of [[constrained optimization]] more realistically describes the best any designer could hope to achieve:

{{quotation|Not knowing the objectives of the designer, Gould was in no position to say whether the designer proposed a faulty compromise among those objectives… In criticizing design, biologists tend to place a premium on functionalities of individual organisms and see design as optimal to the degree that those individual functionalities are maximized. But higher-order designs of entire ecosystems might require lower-order designs of individual organisms to fall short of maximal function.&lt;ref name="Dembski2004"&gt;{{cite book |first=William A. |last=Dembski |year=2004 |title=The Design Revolution: Answering the Toughest Questions About Intelligent Design |publisher=InterVarsity Press |isbn=978-0-8308-3216-3 |lccn=2003020589 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sKVqpXqE0VwC&amp;pg=PA58 |pages=58–59, 61}}&lt;/ref&gt;|William A. Dembski|[[The Design Revolution]]: Answering the Toughest Questions About Intelligent Design}}

===Fideism===
[[Fideism|Fideists]] may reject attempts to prove God's existence. For example, Calvinist theologian [[Karl Barth]] held that God can be known only through Jesus Christ, as revealed in scripture[https://www.hoddereducation.co.uk/media/Documents/RS/1-3_Arguments_for_the_existence_of_God_The_cosmological_argument.pdf], and that any such attempts should be considered idolotry.

=== Other criticisms ===
The teleological argument assumes that one can infer the existence of intelligent design merely by examination, and because life is reminiscent of something a human might design, it too must have been designed. However, considering "snowflakes and crystals of certain salts", "[i]n no case do we find intelligence". "There are other ways that order and design can come about" such as by "purely physical forces".&lt;ref&gt;Cornman, JW, Lehrer, K, Pappas, GS, ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Philosophical_Problems_and_Arguments.html?id=cRHegYZgyfUC Philosophical Problems and Arguments: An Introduction]'', Hackett Publishing, 1992, pp. 245–256.&lt;/ref&gt;

The design claim can be challenged as an [[argument from analogy]]. Supporters of design suggest that natural objects and man-made objects have many similar properties, and man-made objects have a designer. Therefore, it is probable that natural objects must be designed as well. However, proponents must demonstrate that all the available evidence has been taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;Cornman, JW, Lehrer, K, Pappas, GS, ''Philosophical Problems and Arguments: An Introduction'', Hackett Publishing, 1992, p. 239.
https://books.google.com/books/about/Philosophical_Problems_and_Arguments.html?id=cRHegYZgyfUC
&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Rust argues that, when speaking of familiar objects such as watches, "we have a basis to make an inference from such an object to its designer". However, the "universe is a unique and isolated case" and we have nothing to compare it with, so "we have no basis for making an inference such as we can with individual objects. ... We have no basis for applying to the whole universe what may hold of constituent elements in the universe."&lt;ref&gt;Rust, E., ''Religion, Revelation and Reason'', Mercer University Press, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AcSw6GDlLVwC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=criticism+%22teleological+argument%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nUBRU9_IJMfxPOvkgNgN&amp;ved=0CFoQ6AEwBzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=criticism%20%22teleological%20argument%22&amp;f=false 96].&lt;/ref&gt;

Most professional biologists [[Level of support for evolution#Scientific support|support]] the [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary synthesis]], not merely as an alternative explanation for the complexity of life but a better explanation with more supporting evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interacademies.net/10878/13901.aspx IAP Statement on the Teaching of Evolution] Joint statement issued by the national science academies of 67 countries, including the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Royal Society]] (PDF file)&lt;/ref&gt; Living organisms obey the same physical laws as inanimate objects. Over [[Geologic time scale|very long periods of time]] self-replicating structures arose and later formed [[DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, PJ., ''Biology: The Dynamic Science, Volume 1'', 2008, Cengage Learning, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar discussions in other civilizations==

===Hinduism===
[[Nyaya]], the Hindu school of logic, had a version of the argument from design. P.G. Patil writes that, in this view, it is not the complexity of the world from which one can infer the existence of a creator, but the fact that "the world is made up of parts". In this context, it is the Supreme Soul, [[Ishvara]], who created all the world.

The argument is in five parts:
# The ... world ... has been constructed by an intelligent agent.
# On account of being an effect.
# Each and every effect has been constructed by an intelligent agent, just like a pot.
# And the world is an effect.
# Therefore, it has been constructed by an intelligent agent.&lt;ref&gt;Patil, PG., ''Against a Hindu God: Buddhist Philosophy of Religion in India'', Columbia University Press, 2013, Chapter 2.[https://books.google.com/books?id=z88GAfvNGH0C&amp;pg=PT65&amp;dq=buddhism+%22argument+from+design%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uTNVU8_fJcHT7Aa4hYGACw&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=buddhism%20%22argument%20from%20design%22&amp;f=false] In a note, the author says that the Nyaya argument has been called a "cosmo-teleological argument".&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other Hindu schools, such as [[Samkhya]], deny that the existence of God can ever be proved, because such a creator can never be perceived. [[Krishna Mohan Banerjee]], in his ''Dialogues on the Hindu Philosophy'', has the Samkhya speaker saying, "the existence of God cannot be established because there is no proof. ... nor can it be proved by Inference, because you cannot exhibit an analogous instance."&lt;ref&gt;Banerjea, KM., ''Dialogues on the Hindu Philosophy Comprising the Nyaya, the Sankhya, the Vedanta'', Thacker Spink, 1861, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buddhist criticism of Hindu Nyaya logic===
[[Buddhism]] denies the existence of a creator god, and rejects the Nyaya syllogism for the teleological argument as being "logically flawed". Buddhists argue that "the 'creation' of the world cannot be shown to be analogous to the creation of a human artifact, such as a pot."&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, RR., ''Is Enlightenment Possible?: Dharmakīrti and RGyal Tshab Rje on Knowledge, Rebirth, No-self and Liberation'', Snow Lion Publications, 1993, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confucianism===
The 18th century German philosopher [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] once thought that [[Confucius]] was a godless man, and that "the ancient Chinese had no natural religion, since they did not know the creator of the world". However, later, Wolff changed his mind to some extent. "On Wolff's reading, Confucius's religious perspective is thus more or less the weak deistic one of Hume's Cleanthes".&lt;ref&gt;Van Norden, BW., ''Confucius and the Analects'', Oxford University Press, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taoism===
The Taoist writings of the 6th century BC philosopher [[Laozi]], also known as Lao Tzu, have similarities with modern naturalist science. B. Schwartz notes that, in [[Taoism]], "The processes of nature are not guided by a teleological consciousness ... the tao [dao] is not consciously providential.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz, B., Quoted in Lai, K., ''An Introduction to Chinese Philosophy'', Cambridge University Press, 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;79.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Time Machine''''' is a [[science fiction]] novella by [[H. G. Wells]], published in 1895 and written as a [[Frame story|frame narrative]]. The work is generally credited with the popularization of the concept of [[time travel]] by using a vehicle that allows an operator to travel purposely and selectively forwards or backwards in time. The term "time machine", coined by Wells, is now almost universally used to refer to such a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pilkington |first1=Ace G. |title=Science Fiction and Futurism: Their Terms and Ideas |date=2017 |publisher=McFarland |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Time Machine'' has been adapted into three [[feature film]]s of the same name, as well as two [[television]] versions, and a large number of [[comic book]] adaptations. It has also indirectly inspired many more works of [[fiction]] in many media productions.

==History==
Wells had considered the notion of time travel before, in a short story titled "[[The Chronic Argonauts]]" (1888). This work, published in his college newspaper, was the foundation for ''The Time Machine''.

Wells frequently stated that he had thought of using some of this material in a series of articles in the ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'' until the publisher asked him if he could instead write a [[serial novel]] on the same theme. Wells readily agreed and was paid [[Pound sterling|£]]100 (equal to about £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|100|1895|r=-3}}}} today) on its publication by [[Heinemann (book publisher)|Heinemann]] in 1895, which first published the story in serial form in the January to May numbers of ''The New Review'' (newly under the nominal editorship of [[W. E. Henley]]).&lt;ref name="jrhamm04"/&gt; [[Henry Holt and Company]] published the first book edition (possibly prepared from a different manuscript)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.ucr.edu/news_item.html?action=page&amp;id=2256 |department=UCR Newsroom |title=Rare edition of "The Time Machine" acquired |publisher=University of California, Riverside |date=2010-02-09 |access-date=2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 7&amp;nbsp;May 1895; Heinemann published an English edition on 29&amp;nbsp;May.&lt;ref name="jrhamm04"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hammond |first1=John R. |title=H. G. Wells's The Time Machine: A Reference Guide |date=2004 |publisher=Praeger |location=Westport, CT |isbn=0313330077}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two editions are different textually and are commonly referred to as the "Holt text" and "Heinemann text", respectively. Nearly all modern reprints reproduce the Heinemann text.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The story reflects Wells's own [[socialist]] political views, his view on life and abundance, and the contemporary angst about [[industrial relations]]. It is also influenced by [[Ray Lankester]]'s theories about social degeneration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mikejay.net/articles/man-of-the-year-million/ |title=Man Of The Year Million |publisher=Mikejay.net |accessdate=2010-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shares many elements with [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]]'s novel ''[[Vril|Vril, the Power of the Coming Race]]'' (1871).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3-xlc8edbEC&amp;pg=PR46&amp;lpg=PR46&amp;dq=%22references+to+the+Sphinx,+the+buildings,+the+underground+machines%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_VWqsE0mmR&amp;sig=gR-gJJXjMXDO91yZ-LE2XAkp2fk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=u78fUZiiMofAhAfdjoCIBw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22references%20to%20the%20Sphinx%2C%20the%20buildings%2C%20the%20underground%20machines%22&amp;f=false |title=The Coming Race |authors=Edward Bulwer-Lytton, David Seed |via=Google Books |access-date=2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other science fiction works of the period, including [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward|Looking Backward: 2000-1887]]'' (1888) and the later film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927),  dealt with similar themes.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Based on Wells' personal experiences and childhood, the working class literally spent a lot of their time underground. His own family would spend most of their time in a dark basement kitchen when not being occupied in their father's shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/kent/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_9373000/9373313.stm |title=HG Wells' letter goes on display in Sevenoaks |publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, his own mother would work as a housekeeper in a house with underground tunnels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/03/movies/film-wells-s-future-is-forever-recurring.html |department=Film |title=Wells's Future is Forever Recurring |newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the staff and servants lived in underground quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.no/books?id=mR3_3vVoI1sC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=%22rigid+hierarchical+structure+of+staff+and+servants,+and+the+sharp+contrast+between+life+above+and+below+stairs%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WOp7X2i9qA&amp;sig=KP7hCx82IO7IPbJAMFDo2CBf9A4&amp;hl=no&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjbrJS52J_cAhUlAZoKHalnARsQ6AEwAHoECAAQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22rigid%20hierarchical%20structure%20of%20staff%20and%20servants%2C%20and%20the%20sharp%20contrast%20between%20life%20above%20and%20below%20stairs%22&amp;f=false |title=H.

This work is an early example of the [[Dying Earth (subgenre)|Dying Earth subgenre]]. The portion of the novella that sees the Time Traveller in a distant future where the sun is huge and red also places ''The Time Machine'' within the realm of [[eschatology]], i.e. the study of the end times, the end of the world, and the ultimate destiny of humankind.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

[[File:Two complete science adventure books 1951win n4.jpg|thumb|right|''The Time Machine'' was reprinted in ''[[Two Complete Science-Adventure Books]]'' in 1951]]
The book's [[protagonist]] is a [[Victorian era|Victorian]] English [[scientist]] and gentleman [[inventor]] living in [[Richmond, Surrey|Richmond]], [[Surrey]], and identified by a narrator simply as the ''Time Traveller''. The narrator recounts the Traveller's lecture to his weekly dinner guests that time is simply a fourth [[dimension]] and demonstrates a tabletop model machine for travelling through the fourth dimension. He reveals that he has built a machine capable of carrying a person through time, and returns at dinner the following week to recount a remarkable tale, becoming the new narrator.

In the [[frame story|new narrative]], the Time Traveller tests his device. At first he thinks nothing has happened but soon finds out he went five hours into the future. He continues forward and sees his house disappear and turn into a lush garden. The Time Traveller stops in [[Anno Domini|A.D.]] 802,701, where he meets the [[Eloi]], a society of small, elegant, childlike adults. They live in small communities within large and futuristic yet slowly deteriorating buildings, and having a [[plant-based diet|fruit-based diet]]. His efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline.  They appear happy and carefree, but fear the dark and in particular fear moonless nights.  Observing them, he finds that they give no response to mysterious nocturnal disappearances. (Perhaps they had become traumatized and would not discuss it.) He speculates that they are a peaceful society.

Returning to the site where he arrived, the Time Traveller is shocked to find his time machine missing and eventually concludes that it has been dragged by some unknown party into a nearby structure with heavy doors, locked from the inside, which resembles a Sphinx. Luckily, he had removed the machine's levers before leaving it (the time machine being unable to travel through time without them). Later in the dark, he is approached menacingly by the [[Morlock]]s, [[ape]]-like [[caveman|troglodytes]] who live in darkness underground and surface only at night. Exploring one of many "wells" that lead to the Morlocks' dwellings, he discovers the machinery and industry that makes the above-ground paradise of the Eloi possible. He alters his theory, speculating that the human race has evolved into two species: the leisured classes have become the ineffectual Eloi, and the downtrodden [[working class]]es have become the brutal light-fearing Morlocks.

Deducing that the Morlocks have taken his time machine, he explores the Morlock tunnels, learning that due to a lack of any other means of sustenance, they feed on the Eloi.  His revised analysis is that their relationship is not one of lords and servants but of livestock and ranchers. The Time Traveller theorizes that intelligence is the result of and response to danger; with no real challenges facing the Eloi, they have lost the spirit, intelligence, and physical fitness of humanity at its peak.

Meanwhile, he saves an Eloi named [[Weena (The Time Machine)|Weena]] from drowning as none of the other Eloi take any notice of her plight, and they develop an innocently affectionate relationship over the course of several days. He takes Weena with him on an expedition to a distant structure that turns out to be the remains of a museum, where he finds a fresh supply of matches and fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks, whom he must fight to get back his machine. He plans to take Weena back to his own time. Because the long and tiring journey back to Weena's home is too much for them, they stop in the forest for the night. They are then overcome by Morlocks in the night, whereby Weena faints. The Traveller escapes when a small fire he had left behind them to distract the Morlocks catches up to them as a forest fire; Weena and the pursuing Morlocks are lost in the fire and the Time Traveller is devastated over his loss.

The Morlocks open the Sphinx and use the time machine as bait to capture the Traveller, not understanding that he will use it to escape. He reattaches the levers before he travels further ahead to roughly 30&amp;nbsp;million years from his own time. There he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth: Menacing reddish crab-like creatures slowly wandering the blood-red beaches chasing enormous [[butterflies]], in a world covered in simple lichenous vegetation. He continues to make jumps forward through time, seeing Earth's rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out.

Overwhelmed, he goes back to the machine and returns to his own time, arriving at the laboratory just three hours after he originally left. He arrives late to his own dinner party, whereupon, after eating, the Time Traveller relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors, producing as evidence two strange white flowers Weena had put in his pocket. 

The original narrator then takes over and relates that he returned to the Time Traveller's house the next day, finding him preparing for another journey and promising to return in a short time. However, the narrator reveals that he has waited three years before writing and stating the Time Traveller has not returned from his journey.

==Deleted text==
A section from the eleventh chapter of the serial published in ''New Review'' (May 1895) was deleted from the book. It was drafted at the suggestion of Wells's editor, [[William Ernest Henley]], who wanted Wells to "oblige your editor" by lengthening the text with, among other things, an illustration of "the ultimate degeneracy" of humanity. "There was a slight struggle," Wells later recalled, "between the writer and W. E. Henley who wanted, he said, to put a little 'writing' into the tale. But the writer was in reaction from that sort of thing, the Henley interpolations were cut out again, and he had his own way with his text."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hammond |first1=John R. |title=H.

The deleted text recounts an incident immediately after the Traveller's escape from the Morlocks.  He finds himself in the distant future of an unrecognisable Earth, populated with furry, hopping herbivores resembling [[kangaroo]]s.  He stuns or kills one with a rock, and upon closer examination realises they are probably the descendants of humans / Eloi / Morlocks. A gigantic, centipede-like [[arthropod]] approaches and the Traveller flees into the next day, finding that the creature has apparently eaten the tiny humanoid.

==Scholarship==
Significant scholarly commentary on ''The Time Machine'' began from the early 1960s, initially contained in various broad studies of Wells's early novels (such as Bernard Bergonzi's ''The Early H.G. Wells: A Study of the Scientific Romances'') and studies of utopias/dystopias in science fiction (such as Mark R. Hillegas's ''The Future as Nightmare: H.G. Wells and the Anti-Utopians''). Much critical and textual work was done in the 1970s, including the tracing of the very complex publication history of the text, its drafts, and unpublished fragments.

===Academic publications===
A further resurgence in scholarship came around the time of the novella's centenary in 1995, and a major outcome of this was the 1995 conference and substantial anthology of academic papers, which was collected in print as ''H.G. Wells’s Perennial Time Machine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |conference=H.G. Wells’s ''Time Machine'' centenary conference, 1995 |title=H.G. Wells’s Perennial Time Machine: Selected Essays from the Centenary Conference, "The Time Machine: Past, Present, and Future" |publisher=University of Georgia Press |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This publication then allowed the development of a guide-book for academic study at Master's and Ph.D. level: ''H.G. Wells's The Time Machine: A Reference Guide''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=H.G. Wells's The Time Machine: A reference guide |publisher=Praeger |year=2004 |last1=Hammond |first1=John R. |location=Westport, CT |isbn=0313330077}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The scholarly journal ''The Wellsian'' has published around twenty articles on ''The Time Machine'', and a U.S. academic journal ''The Undying Fire'', devoted to H.G. Wells studies, has published three articles since its inception in 2002. Richard Wasson explores the use in ''The Time Machine'' of [[myth]] and [[Mythologies (book)#exnomination|ex-nomination of class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wasson |first=Richard |title=Myth and the ex-nomination of class in ''The Time Machine'' |journal=[[The Minnesota Review]] |volume=15 |pages=112–122 |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |date=Fall 1980 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/427124 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subtext of the names ''Eloi'' and ''Morlock''===
The name ''[[Eloi]]'' is the Hebrew plural for Elohim, or lesser gods, in the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Time Machine: An invention – A critical text of the 1895 London first edition |last=Stover |first=Leon |publisher=McFarland &amp; Company |year=1996 |isbn=0786401249 |location=Jefferson, NC |pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wells' source for the name ''morlock'' is less clear. It may refer to the [[Ancient Canaanite religion|Canaanite]] god [[Moloch]] associated with child sacrifice. The name [[Morlock]] may be a play on ''mollocks'' – what miners might call themselves – or a Scots word for rubbish,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or a reference to the [[Morlacchi]] community in Dalmatia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.nz/books?id=u5tUbUyXtToC&amp;dq |article=The rise and fall of 'Morlacchismo': South Slavic identity in the mountains of Dalmatia |last=Wolff |first=Larry |title=Yugoslavia and Its Historians: Understanding the Balkan Wars of the 1990s |publisher=Stanford University Press |year=2003 |editor-last=Naimark |editor-first=Norman |pages=49 |editor-last2=Case |editor-first2=Holly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbols===
''The Time Machine'' can be read as a symbolic novel. The time machine itself can be viewed as a symbol, and there are several symbols in the narrative, including the Sphinx, flowers, and fire.

* The statue of the Sphinx is the place where the Morlocks hide the time machine and references the Sphinx in the story of [[Oedipus]] who gives a riddle that he must first solve before he can pass.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Science Fiction Before 1900: Imagination Discovers Technology |last=Alkon |first=Paul K. |publisher=Twayne Publishers |year=1994 |isbn=0805709525 |location=New York |pages=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sphinx appeared on the cover of the first London edition as requested by Wells and would have been familiar to his readers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

* The white flowers can symbolize Weena's devotion and innocence and contrast with the machinery of the time machine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; They are the only proof that the Time Traveller's story is true.

* Fire symbolizes civilization: the Time Traveller uses it to ward off the Morlocks, but it escapes his control and turns into a forest fire.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Adaptations==
=== Radio and audio ===
====''Escape'' radio broadcasts====
The CBS radio anthology ''[[Escape (radio program)|Escape]]'' adapted ''The Time Machine'' twice, in 1948 starring [[Jeff Corey]], and again in 1950 starring [[Lawrence Dobkin]] as the traveller. In both episodes, a script adapted by Irving Ravetch was used. The Time Traveller was named '''Dudley''' and was accompanied by his skeptical friend Fowler as they traveled to the year 100,080.

====1994 Alien Voices audio drama====
In 1994, an audio drama was released on cassette and CD by Alien Voices, starring [[Leonard Nimoy]] as the Time Traveller (named '''John''' in this adaptation) and [[John de Lancie]] as David Filby. John de Lancie's children, Owen de Lancie and [[Keegan de Lancie]], played the parts of the Eloi. The drama is approximately two hours long and is more faithful to the story than several of the film adaptations. Some changes are made to reflect modern language and knowledge of science.

==== 7th Voyage ====
In 2000, Alan Young read ''The Time Machine'' for 7th&amp;nbsp;Voyage Productions, Inc., in 2016 to celebrate the 120th Anniversary of H.G. Wells' novella.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lucas |first1=Clyde |title=The Time Machine Alan Young |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3630388/ |date=28 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2009 BBC Radio 3 broadcast====
[[Robert Glenister]] starred as the Time Traveller, with [[William Gaunt]] as [[H. G. Wells]] in a new 100-minute radio dramatisation by Philip Osment, directed by [[Jeremy Mortimer]] as part of a BBC Radio Science Fiction season. This was the first adaptation of the novella for British radio. It was first broadcast on 22&amp;nbsp;February 2009 on [[BBC Radio 3]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00hr4hq |department=BBC Radio 3 – Drama on 3 |title=The Time Machine |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=2009-08-30 |accessdate=2015-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later published as a 2-CD BBC audio book.

The other cast members were:
*Donnla Hughes as Martha
*Gunnar Cauthery as Young H. G. Wells
*[[Stephen Critchlow]] as Filby, friend of the young Wells
*Chris Pavlo as Bennett, friend of the young Wells
*Manjeet Mann as Mrs. Watchett, the Traveller's housemaid
*Jill Crado as Weena, one of the Eloi and the Traveller's partner
*[[Robert Lonsdale]], Inam Mirza, and [[Dan Starkey (actor)|Dan Starkey]] as other characters

The adaptation retained the nameless status of the Time Traveller and set it as a true story told to the young Wells by the time traveller, which Wells then re-tells as an older man to the American journalist, Martha, whilst firewatching on the roof of [[Broadcasting House]] during [[the Blitz]]. It also retained the deleted ending from the novella as a recorded message sent back to Wells from the future by the traveller using a prototype of his machine, with the traveller escaping the anthropoid creatures to 30&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;AD at the end of the universe before disappearing or dying there.

====Big Finish====
On 5&amp;nbsp;September 2017, [[Big Finish Productions]] released an adaptation of ''The Time Machine''. This adaptation was written by [[Marc Platt (writer)|Marc Platt]], and starred [[Ben Miles]] as the Time Traveller.

Platt explained in an interview that adapting The Time Machine to audio was not much different to writing Doctor Who, and that he can see where some of the roots of early Doctor Who came from.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bigfinish.com/news/v/out-now-hg-wells-the-time-machine |title=Out Now: H.G. Wells' ''The Time Machine''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film adaptations ===

==== 1949 BBC teleplay ====
The first visual adaptation of the book was a live teleplay broadcast from [[Alexandra Palace]] on 25 January 1949 by the [[BBC]], which starred [[Russell Napier]] as the Time Traveller and Mary Donn as Weena. No recording of this live broadcast was made; the only record of the production is the script and a few black and white still photographs. A reading of the script, however, suggests that this teleplay remained fairly faithful to the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cornell |first1=Paul |last2=Day |first2=Martin |last3=Topping |first3=Keith |title=The Classic British Telefantasy Guide |page=7 |date=30 July 2015 |publisher=Orion Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-575-13352-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1960 film====
{{main|The Time Machine (1960 film)}}

In 1960, the novella was made into an American [[science fiction film]], also known promotionally as ''H.G. Wells' The Time Machine''. The film starred [[Rod Taylor]], [[Alan Young]], and [[Yvette Mimieux]]. The film was produced and directed by [[George Pal]], who also filmed a 1953 version of Wells' ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]''.  The film won an Academy Award for [[time-lapse]] photographic effects showing the world changing rapidly.

In 1993, Rod Taylor hosted ''[[Time Machine: The Journey Back]]'' reuniting him with Alan Young and Whit Bissell, featuring the only sequel to Mr. Pal's classic film, written by the original screenwriter, David Duncan. In the special were [[Academy Award]]-winners special effect artists [[Wah Chang]] and [[Gene Warren]].

====1978 television film====
{{main|The Time Machine (1978 film)}}
[[Sunn Classic Pictures]] produced a television film version of ''The Time Machine'' as a part of their "[[Classics Illustrated]]" series in 1978. It was a modernization of the Wells' story, making the Time Traveller a 1970s scientist working for a fictional US [[defence contractor]], "the Mega Corporation". Dr. '''Neil Perry''' ([[John Beck (actor)|John Beck]]), the Time Traveller, is described as one of Mega's most reliable contributors by his senior co-worker Branly (Whit Bissell, an alumnus of the 1960 adaptation).  Perry's skill is demonstrated by his rapid reprogramming of an off-course missile, averting a disaster that could destroy [[Los Angeles]]. His reputation secures a grant of $20 million for his time machine project. Although nearing completion, the corporation wants Perry to put the project on hold so that he can head a military weapon development project.  Perry accelerates work on the time machine, permitting him to test it before being forced to work on the new project.

====2002 film====
&lt;!-- This section about a U.S.-produced film whose setting was moved to the U.S. uses a different English variant. --&gt;
{{main|The Time Machine (2002 film)}}
The 1960 film was [[The Time Machine (2002 film)|remade]] in 2002, starring [[Guy Pearce]] as the Time Traveller, a mechanical engineering professor named Alexander Hartdegen, [[Mark Addy]] as his colleague David Filby, [[Sienna Guillory]] as Alex's ill-fated fiancée Emma, [[Phyllida Law]] as Mrs. Watchit, and [[Jeremy Irons]] as the Uber-Morlock. Playing a quick cameo as a shopkeeper was [[Alan Young]], who featured in the 1960 film. (H.G. Wells himself can also be said to have a "cameo" appearance, in the form of a photograph on the wall of Alex's home, near the front door.)

The film was directed by Wells's great-grandson [[Simon Wells]], with an even more revised plot that incorporated the ideas of [[paradox]]es and changing the past. The place is changed from Richmond, Surrey, to downtown [[New York City]], where the Time Traveller moves forward in time to find answers to his questions on 'Practical Application of Time Travel;' first in 2030 New York, to witness an orbital lunar catastrophe in 2037, before moving on to 802,701 for the main plot. He later briefly finds himself in 635,427,810 with toxic clouds and a world laid waste (presumably by the Morlocks) with devastation and Morlock artifacts stretching out to the horizon.

It was met with generally negative  reviews and earned $56 million before VHS/DVD sales. The Time Machine used a design that was very reminiscent of the one in the Pal film but was much larger and employed polished turned brass construction, along with rotating glass reminiscent of the [[Fresnel lens]]es common to lighthouses. (In Wells's original book, the Time Traveller mentioned his 'scientific papers on optics'). Hartdegen becomes involved with a female Eloi named Mara, played by [[Samantha Mumba]], who essentially takes the place of Weena, from the earlier versions of the story. &lt;!-- Mara may be either the 2002 film counterpart to Weena or a distinct character. We'd like to see reliable sources one way or the other. --&gt; In this film, the Eloi have, as a tradition, preserved a "stone language" that is identical to English. The Morlocks are much more barbaric and agile, and the Time Traveller has a direct impact on the plot.

=== Derivative work ===
====''Time After Time'' (1979 film)====
{{main|Time After Time (1979 film)}}
In ''Time After Time'', H.G. Wells invents a time machine and shows it to some friends in a manner similar to the first part of the novella. He does not know that one of his friends is Jack The Ripper. The Ripper, fleeing police, escapes to the future (1979), but without a key which prevents the machine from remaining in the future. When it does return home, Wells follows him in order to protect the future (which he imagines to be a utopia) from the Ripper. In turn, the film inspired a 2017 [[Time After Time (TV series)|TV series]] of the same name.

===Comics===
''Classics Illustrated'' was the first to adapt ''The Time Machine'' into a [[comic book]] format, issuing an American edition in July 1956.

The Classics Illustrated version was published in French by ''Classiques Illustres'' in Dec 1957, and ''Classics Illustrated'' Strato Publications (Australian) in 1957, and ''Kuvitettuja Klassikkoja'' (a Finnish edition) in November 1957.  There were also ''Classics Illustrated'' Greek editions in 1976, Swedish in 1987, German in 1992 and 2001, and a Canadian reprint of the English edition in 2008.

In 1976, [[Marvel Comics]] published a new version of ''The Time Machine'', as #2 in their ''[[Marvel Classics Comics]]'' series, with art by [[Alex Niño]]. (This adaptation was originally published in 1973 by [[Pendulum Press]] as part of their ''Pendulum Now Age Classics'' series; it was colorized and reprinted by Marvel in 1976.) From April 1990, [[Eternity Comics]] published a three-issue miniseries adaptation of ''The Time Machine'', written by [[Bill Spangler]] and illustrated by [[John Ross (artist)|John Ross]] — this was collected as a trade paperback [[graphic novel]] in 1991.

==Sequels by other authors==
{{uncited section|date=September 2018}}

Wells's novella has become one of the cornerstones of science-fiction literature. As a result, it has spawned many offspring. Works expanding on{{cn|date=September 2018}}&lt;!--currently this reads as original research, we need evidence that critics have stated these are expansions on ''The Time Machine''--&gt; Wells's story include:

* ''La Belle Valence'' by Théo Varlet and André Blandin (1923) in which a squadron of [[World War I]] soldiers find the Time Machine and are transported back to the Spanish town of [[Valencia]] in [[Valencia#Golden Age of Valencia|the 14th century]]. Translated by [[Brian Stableford]] as ''Timeslip Troopers'' (2012).

* ''Die Rückkehr der Zeitmaschine'' (1946) by [[Egon Friedell]] was the first direct sequel. It dwells heavily on the technical details of the machine and the time-paradoxes it might cause when the time machine was used to visit the past. This culminates in Westminster Abbey being used as a butcher shop of human beings by the Morlocks in the 20th century, and a total disruption and collapse of the time stream. There the hero and Merlin must find — and destroy — the Time Machine, to restore the time stream and history.  The 24,000-word German original was translated into English by Eddy C. Bertin in the 1940s and eventually published in paperback as ''The Return of the Time Machine'' (1972, DAW).
*''The Hertford Manuscript'' by [[John Middleton Murry, Jr.|Richard Cowper]], first published in 1976. It features a "manuscript", which reports the Time Traveller's activities after the end of the original story. According to this manuscript, the Time Traveller disappeared, because his Time Machine had been damaged by the Morlocks without him knowing it. He only found out when it stopped operating during his next attempted time travel. He found himself on 27&amp;nbsp;August 1665, in [[London]] during the outbreak of the [[Great Plague of London]]. The rest of the novel is devoted to his efforts to repair the Time Machine and leave this time period before getting infected with the disease. He also has an encounter with [[Robert Hooke]]. He eventually dies of the disease on 20 September 1665. The story gives a list of subsequent owners of the manuscript until 1976. It also gives the name of the Time Traveller as Robert James Pensley, born to James and Martha Pensley in 1850 and disappearing without trace on 18&amp;nbsp;June 1894.

* ''[[The Space Machine]]'' by [[Christopher Priest (novelist)|Christopher Priest]], first published in 1976. Because of the movement of planets, stars, and galaxies, for a time machine to stay in one spot on Earth as it travels through time, it must also follow the Earth's trajectory through space. In Priest's book, a travelling salesman damages a Time Machine similar to the original, and arrives on [[Mars]], just before the start of the invasion described in ''[[The War of the Worlds]]''. H.G. Wells appears as a minor character.

* ''[[Morlock Night]]'' by [[K. W. Jeter]], first published in 1979. A [[steampunk]] fantasy novel in which the Morlocks, having studied the Traveller's machine, duplicate it and invade Victorian London.

* ''Time Machine II'' by [[George Pal]] and Joe Morhaim, published in 1981. The Time Traveller, named George, and the pregnant Weena try to return to his time, but instead land in the London Blitz, dying during a bombing raid. Their newborn son is rescued by an American ambulance driver and grows up in the United States under the name Christopher Jones. Sought out by the lookalike son of James Filby, Jones goes to England to collect his inheritance, leading ultimately to George's journals, and the Time Machine's original plans. He builds his own machine with 1970s upgrades and seeks his parents in the future.  Pal also worked on a detailed synopsis for a third sequel, which was partly filmed for a 1980s U.S. TV special on the making of Pal's film version of ''The Time Machine'', using the original actors. This third sequel, the plot of which does not seem to fit with Pal's second, opens with the Time Traveller enjoying a happy life with Weena, in a future world in which the Morlocks have died out. He and his son return to save Filby in [[World War I]].  This act changes the future, causing the nuclear war not to happen.  He and his son are thus cut off from Weena in the far future. The Time Traveller thus has to solve a dilemma — allow his friend to die, and cause the later death of millions, or give up Weena forever.

* ''The Man Who Loved Morlocks'' (1981) and ''The Truth about Weena'' (1998) are two different sequels, the former a novel and the latter a short story, by [[David Lake (writer)|David J. Lake]]. Each of them concerns the Time Traveller's return to the future. In the former, he discovers that he cannot enter any period in time he has already visited, forcing him to travel into the further future, where he finds love with a woman whose race evolved from Morlock stock. In the latter, he is accompanied by Wells and succeeds in rescuing Weena and bringing her back to the 1890s, where her political ideas cause a peaceful revolution.

* ''[[The Time Ships]]'', by [[Stephen Baxter (author)|Stephen Baxter]], first published in 1995. This sequel was officially authorised by the Wells estate to mark the centenary of the original's publication. In its wide-ranging narrative, the Traveller's desire to return and rescue Weena is thwarted by the fact that he has changed history (by telling his tale to his friends, one of whom published the account). With a Morlock (in the new history, the Morlocks are intelligent and cultured), he travels through the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]] as increasingly complicated timelines unravel around him, eventually meeting mankind's far future descendants, whose ambition is to travel back to the birth of the universe, and modify the way the multiverse will unfold. This sequel includes many nods to the prehistory of Wells's story in the names of characters and chapters.

* ''The Steam Man of the Prairie and the Dark Rider Get Down: A Dime Novel'' by [[Joe R. Lansdale]], first published in ''[[The Long Ones]]'' (1999). In this story, the Time Traveller accidentally damages the space-time continuum and is transformed into the vampire-like Dark Rider.

* The 2003 short story "On the Surface" by [[Robert J. Sawyer]] begins with this quote from the Wells original: "I have suspected since that the Morlocks had even partially taken it [the time machine] to pieces while trying in their dim way to grasp its purpose." In the Sawyer story, the Morlocks develop a fleet of time machines and use them to conquer the same far future Wells depicted at the end of the original, by which time, because the sun has grown red and dim and thus no longer blinds them, they can reclaim the surface of the world.

* The Time Traveller and his machine appear in the story ''[[Allan and the Sundered Veil]]'' by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]], which acts as a prequel to ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One]]''. The Time Traveller shares an adventure with fellow literary icons [[Allan Quatermain]], [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]], and [[Randolph Carter]].

* David Haden's novelette ''The Time Machine: A Sequel'' (2010) is a direct sequel, picking up where the original finished. The Time Traveller goes back to rescue Weena but finds the Eloi less simple than he first imagined, and time travel far more complicated.

* Simon Baxter's novel ''The British Empire: Psychic Battalions Against the Morlocks'' (2010) imagines a [[steampunk]]/[[cyberpunk]] future in which the [[British Empire]] has remained the dominant world force until the Morlocks arrive from the future.

* [[Hal Colebatch]]'s ''Time-Machine Troopers'' (2011) (Acashic Publishers) is twice the length of the original. In it, the Time Traveller returns to the future world about 18 years after the time he escaped from the Morlocks, taking with him [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]], the real-world founder of the Boy Scout movement. They set out to teach the Eloi self-reliance and self-defence against the Morlocks, but the Morlocks capture them. H.G. Wells and [[Winston Churchill]] are also featured as characters.

*Paul Schullery's ''The Time Traveller's Tale: Chronicle of a Morlock Captivity'' (2012) continues the story in the voice and manner of the original Wells book. After many years' absence, the Time Traveller returns and describes his further adventures. His attempts to mobilize the Eloi in their own defense against the Morlocks failed when he was captured by the Morlocks. Much of the book is occupied with his deeply unsettling discoveries about the Morlock / Eloi symbiosis, his gradual assimilation into Morlock society, and his ultimately successful attempt to discover the true cause of humanity's catastrophic transformation into two such tragic races.

* The ''[[Great Illustrated Classics]]'' in 1992 published an adaptation of Wells' novella that adds an extra destination to the Time Traveller's adventure: Stopping in 2200&amp;nbsp;AD on his way back home, he becomes caught up in a civil war between factions of a [[technocratic]] society that was established to avert ecological catastrophe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6730">A '''thought collective''', a term originated in German as "''Denkkollektiv''" by the Polish and Israeli physician [[Ludwik Fleck]], is a community of researchers who interact collectively towards the production or elaboration of knowledge using a shared framework of cultural customs and knowledge acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2016/entries/fleck/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Sady|first=Wojciech|date=2016|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1935 book ''[[Entstehung und Entwicklung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache; Einführung in die Lehre vom Denkstil und Denkkollektiv]],'' Fleck identified the scientific production of knowledge as primarily a social process that hinges upon prior discoveries and practices in a way that constrains and preconditions new ideas and concepts. He termed this shared collection of preexisting knowledge a "''Denkstil''" or '''thought style''' and formulated a comparative epistemology of science using these two ideas.

== ''Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact'' ==
[[Ludwik Fleck]], a Polish and Israeli physician and biologist working during the 20th century, developed an idea of scientific knowledge creation as being primarily a social practice dependent on the cultural and historical practices within which researchers find themselves. He elaborated this idea with a series of examples in the 1935 essay ''Entstehung und Entwicklung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache'', together with a book of the same name, however, his ideas went largely unnoticed until Thomas Kuhn's rediscovery of them in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Fleck, Ludwik. Entstehung Und Entwicklung Einer Wissenschaftlichen Tatsache: Einführung in Die Lehre Vom Denkstil Und Denkkollectiv. Basel: B. Schwabe, 1935. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Within the text, Fleck uses the identification of syphilis in the late-1800s and early-1900s as an example of a scientific fact that was supremely conditioned by the historical and social context in which it was discovered. He likens the statement that a scientific fact has been ascertained to a statement of the type "'someone recognizes something,'" a statement meaningless without further context. He continues the example to state that just as the sentence "'Town A is situated to the left of town B'" is incomplete without an observational reference frame, such as "'to someone walking on the road from town C to town B,'" so too is a scientific discovery incomplete without considerations of the social practices that condition it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact|last=Fleck|first=Ludwik|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1979|isbn=0226253244|editor-last=Merton|editor-first=Robert K.|location=Chicago|pages=38–50|translator-last=Bradley|translator-first=Fred|translator-last2=Trenn|translator-first2=Thaddeus J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fleck's goal for this discussion was to situate the discovery of new scientific facts, a form of epistemological cognition, within the greater environment of knowledge that encompasses them. He promotes with the idea of the ''"Denkkollektiv"'' the tenant that any discovery is an interaction between at least three things, namely the discovered phenomenon, the discoverer, and the existing pool of knowledge from which they draw. By interacting socially in their production of knowledge, researchers produce common concepts and practices that they use to discuss and debate one another's ideas and discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;Brorson, Stig, and Hanne Andersen. “Stabilizing and Changing Phenomenal Worlds: Ludwik Fleck and Thomas Kuhn on Scientific Literature.” ''Journal for General Philosophy of Science / Zeitschrift Für Allgemeine Wissenschaftstheorie'', vol. 32, no. 1, 2001, pp. 109–129., www.jstor.org/stable/25171193.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stump, David. “The Role of Skill in Experimentation: Reading Ludwik Fleck's Study of the Wasserman Reaction as an Example of Ian Hacking's Experimental Realism.” ''PSA: Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association'', vol. 1988, 1988, pp. 302–308., www.jstor.org/stable/192997.&lt;/ref&gt; These common concepts and practices both provide a shared language of science within which they can communicate, and consequently limit the possibilities of thought that the researchers can have. Under the influence of a particular "thought style," the common concepts and practices previously mentioned, a community of researchers "shares joint attributes of problems and judgments considered as evident, joint methods to acquire knowledge, and agrees in the determination of meaningless questions."&lt;ref&gt;Forstner, Christian. “The Early History of David Bohm's Quantum Mechanics Through the Perspective of Ludwik Fleck's Thought-Collectives.” ''Minerva'', vol. 46, no. 2, 2008, pp. 215–229., www.jstor.org/stable/41821460.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this conception of the production of scientific knowledge, the ideas, concepts, and theories of these researchers are permanently conditioned by their present "thought style" and cannot be considered independently of them.

As a result of his formulation of the thought style and thought collective concepts, Fleck attempted to situate the individual scientific discoverer within the system of individuals that compromise the community of interacting researchers. To this end, he maintained that the individual's only contribution to the production of new knowledge is the determination of results that follow from established conceptual preconditions. As he states, "the preconditions correspond to active linkages and constitute that portion of cognition belonging to the collective."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ascertaining of scientific knowledge as such is a result of connections between concepts and ideas that are laid out by the community of researchers, laying the groundwork from which individual researchers can draw their conclusions. Just as a soccer player makes little progress in a game without their interactions among a cooperating team, an individual researcher is lost without the thought collective that shapes their approach to scientific practice. Extending this analogy, ideas and concepts exchange between individuals in the thought collective like passes in a soccer match, each time gaining new directions and a change in momentum. With the greater collective and style of practice taken into account, scientific discoveries can be considered as communal social products influenced by the particular milieu that surrounds them.

'''The Graduate School of Education and Information Studies (GSE&amp;IS)''' is one of the professional graduate schools at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. Located in [[Los Angeles, California]], the school combines two distinguished departments whose research and doctoral training programs are committed to expanding the range of knowledge in [[education]], [[information science]], and associated disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/ "Welcome to GSE&amp;IS"] UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies. Retrieved January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1881, the school is the oldest unit at [[UCLA]], having been founded as a [[normal school]] prior to the establishment of the university. It was incorporated into the [[University of California]] in 1919. The school offers a wide variety of doctoral and master's degrees, including the [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], [[M.Ed.]], [[Master of Library and Information Science|M.L.I.S.]], [[Ed.D.]], and [[Ph.D.]], as well as professional certificates and credentials in education and information studies. It also hosts visiting scholars and a number of research centers, institutes, and programs.

Both of its departments have consistently ranked highly among graduate schools of education and Master's of Library and Information Science by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' in every year in which the magazine has published such rankings. ''U.S. News and World Report'' does not rank doctoral programs in information studies, but the information studies faculty consistently ranks among the most productive and highly cited faculty in its field, according to a standard quadrennial peer-reviewed study by professors within that field.&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, Denice and Budd, John. "Scholarly Productivity of U.S. LIS Faculty." ''Library &amp; Information Science Research'' 28.3 (Autumn 2006):374-389, in which UCLA ranks as the 4th most productive and 3rd most highly cited faculty. John Budd is a professor in the School of Information Science and Learning Technologies, [[University of Missouri]].In 2000 Budd published rankings in ''[[Library Journal]]'' 70.2 (April 2000):230; UCLA ranked 8th and 3rd respectively. In 1996 Budd published rankings in ''[[The Library Quarterly]]'' 6.1 (1996):1-20; UCLA ranked 1st and 2nd respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; GSE&amp;IS faculty are members of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucla.edu/facultyhonors/art_sci.html UCLA Members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Institute of Medicine]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucla.edu/facultyhonors/iom.html UCLA Members of the Institute of Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucla.edu/facultyhonors/advance-science.html UCLA Members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science]&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Academy of Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucla.edu/facultyhonors/na_education.html UCLA Members of the National Academy of Education]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Because of the school's size, GSE&amp;IS is located in three buildings on the UCLA campus in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California]]. Moore Hall primarily houses the school's administration and education faculty. Built in 1930 and designed by [[George W. Kelham]], Moore Hall is among the most architecturally significant buildings at UCLA, an example of the school's original [[Romanesque Revival]] style. During the campus' expansion during the 1950s, the [[modernist]] architect [[Kemper Nomland]] refurbished Moore Hall. The building was again refurbished by the Los Angeles-based architectural firm Robert Englekirk &amp; Associates in 1993. Moore Hall is located directly south of [[Powell Library]], adjacent to [[Bruin Walk]], Kerkhoff Hall and Ackerman Union, in the middle of campus.&lt;ref name="UCLA Buildings"&gt;[http://www.aim.ucla.edu/prof02/bldgs.pdf UCLA Buildings]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mathematical Sciences Building (popularly known as "Math Sciences") houses some of the school's research centers, programs, and institutes, in addition to the administrative and faculty offices of the Mathematical Sciences. The building was built in 1957 and designed by Stanton &amp; Stockwell in the mid-century [[modernist]] style. The Mathematical Sciences Building is located in the middle of campus, directly south of Moore Hall, at the north-west corner of the Court of Sciences.&lt;ref name="UCLA Buildings"/&gt; The GSE&amp;IS Building primarily houses the information studies faculty and computer and research labs. Built in 1991, the building is located in the northern part of the UCLA campus, off [[Sunset Boulevard]], directly adjacent to the [[Charles E. Young Research Library]], UCLA's main research library.&lt;ref&gt;[http://space.admin.ucla.edu/space_plsql/pkg_gui.home?body=pkg_gui.campus%3Fp_loc_id=366 GSEIS Building]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies can trace its history back to a state legislative act in 1881 that established a "southern branch" of the [[California State Normal School]] in [[Los Angeles]]. When it opened in 1882 (on what is now the site of the Central Library of the [[Los Angeles Public Library]] system), its primary responsibility was teacher training. The Department of Education was established in 1894. The school was renamed the Los Angeles State Normal School in 1914, and in 1917 the school was moved to a larger site on [[Vermont Avenue]] (on what is now the site of [[Los Angeles City College]]). The new facility included an [[elementary school]] where teachers-in-training could practice their teaching technique on children. That same year Ernest Carroll Moore (for whom Moore Hall is named) was appointed its director. The [[University of California]] opened its [[Southern Branch of the University of California|southern branch]] in 1919 by replacing the Los Angeles State Normal School with the University's Teachers College. A southern branch of the College of Letters and Science, which enrolled considerably fewer students than the Teachers College, was also established as part of the campus. Moore became director of the southern campus (later [[Provost (education)|provost]]) and [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the Teachers College, a position he held until 1939. The campus moved to its current location in [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood, Los Angeles]] in 1929.&lt;ref name="sunsite.berkeley.edu"&gt;Los Angeles: Schools and Colleges.

[[File:Moore Hall West Side.jpg|thumb|240px|left|Moore Hall west side entrance]]
In 1930 Los Angeles City Librarian Everett R. Perry proposed to the president of the [[University of California]] the establishment of a library school on the Los Angeles campus of the University. By 1935 the School of Librarianship was opened at the University's campus at Berkeley (now the [[UC Berkeley School of Information]]), which was later suspended through [[World War II]]. UCLA University Librarian [[Lawrence Clark Powell]], among other Los Angeles leaders, resumed the prewar interest in a library school at UCLA. The [[Regents of the University of California]] approved the establishment of the school in 1958. Powell (for whom [[Powell Library]] is named) resigned his position as University Librarian to become [[Dean (education)|dean]] of the new school. The school was established with collaboration from the School of Librarianship at Berkeley. The two schools initially created a single alumni association and doctoral students took courses, when appropriate, at either campus.&lt;ref name="sunsite.berkeley.edu"/&gt; From its inception the school hired faculty from other disciplines, namely mathematician [[Robert M. Hayes]]. With innovation in [[information technology]] after [[World War II]], library programs became increasingly multidisciplinary, effectively providing a disciplinary home for the interdisciplinary study of [[information science]]. Many library schools have since been repositioned as [[information schools]], schools of information science, or schools of library and information science. ''See the [[Information science#History|history of information science]].''

The School of Education and the School of Library and Information Science were incorporated into the Graduate School of Education and Information Studies in 1994. UCLA is the only major research university in the country that combines these two areas of study into a single school or college.&lt;ref name="GSE&amp;IS Facts"&gt;[http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/news/facts.html GSE&amp;IS Facts]&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2014, Dean Marcelo Suárez-Orozco became the inaugural Wasserman Dean of Education &amp; Information Studies. The Wasserman Endowed Deanship of Education &amp; Information Studies is made possible by the Wasserman Foundation. It marks a historic milestone for the graduate school and the university as it establishes the very first endowed deanship at UCLA. “This gift from the Wasserman Foundation reflects its investment in both UCLA and Dean Marcelo Suárez-Orozco as transformative leaders in education for greater Los Angeles and beyond,” UCLA Chancellor Gene Block stated.

==Departments==

===Department of Education===

Consistently ranked within the top ten [[Graduate School|graduate]] [[School of Education|schools of education]] by ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'',&lt;ref name="GSE&amp;IS Facts"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/grad/rankings/edu/brief/edurank_brief.php "Top Education Programs"] ''U.S. News and World Report.'' Retrieved January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the Department of Education is committed to understanding and improving education practice in a diverse society. The Department of Education is UCLA's oldest unit, since UCLA was founded as a [[normal school]] for the training of teachers. Divisions within the Department of Education include Urban Schooling, Student Affairs, Educational Leadership, Higher Education and Organizational Change, Human Development and Psychology (formerly Psychological Studies in Education), Social Research Methodology, Social Sciences and Comparative Education, among others. The program offers both a [[Masters degree|Masters]] (awarded after one year of study) and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] program. The department is especially known for its research in the study of student testing and assessment, teacher and continuing education and development - particularly in urban, multi-ethnic environments, early childhood development, and issues of access, equity and quality facing higher education.&lt;ref name="GSE&amp;IS Facts"/&gt; The department is home to [[National Center for Research on Evaluation, Standards, and Student Testing]] (CRESST), the [[Higher Education Research Institute]] (HERI), [[The Civil Rights Project/Proyecto Derechos Civiles]] (CRP/PDC), the UC All Campus Consortium On Research and Diversity (UC ACCORD), and the Center for International and Development Education (CIDE), among others.

===Department of Information Studies===

Accredited by the [[American Library Association]] and a founding member of the [[I-Schools]] caucus, the Department of Information Studies ranks the 4th most productive and 3rd most highly cited faculty in the latest Budd survey of "Scholarly Productivity of U.S. LIS Faculty" (as measured per capita of faculty).&lt;ref&gt;Adkins, Denice and Budd, John. "Scholarly Productivity of U.S. LIS Faculty." ''Library &amp; Information Science Research'' 28.3 (Autumn 2006):374-389. John Budd is a professor in the School of Information Science and Learning Technologies, [[University of Missouri]]. In 2000 Budd published rankings in ''[[Library Journal]]'' 70.2 (April 2000):230; UCLA ranked 8th and 3rd respectively. In 1996 Budd published rankings in ''[[The Library Quarterly]]'' 6.1 (1996):1-20; UCLA ranked 1st and 2nd respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'' ranks the Master's of Library Science program among the top 13 in the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/grad/library.html "Top Programs in Library and Information Studies"] ''U.S. News and World Report.'' Retrieved December 7, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly, the Department of Information Studies examines the application, communication, processing, representation and social consequences of technology. It also studies the structure, behavior, and interactions of natural and engineered computational systems. Traditionally, it is concerned with the gathering, manipulation, classification, storage, and retrieval of recorded knowledge. The central notion is the transformation and dissemination of information - whether by computation or communication, whether by organisms or artifacts. In this sense, it is more or less a merge of artificial intelligence, cognitive science, computing science, and related fields. The UCLA Department of Information Studies is regarded for its cultural studies and social justice approach to Information Studies.

The department offers an undergraduate program in [[Information Science|Information Studies]]; the [[Masters degree|Masters]] in [[Library and Information Science]] (awarded after two years of study), which has three focus areas: Library Studies, Archival Studies, and [[Informatics (academic field)|Informatics]]; the [[PhD]] in [[Information Science|Information Studies]]; and the Moving Image Archive Studies [[Master of Arts|M.A.]], an inter-departmental program jointly sponsored by the [[UCLA Film and Television Archive]], and the Department of Film, Television and Digital Media in the [[UCLA School of Theater Film and Television]]. The department is home to the California Center for the Book, a division of the [[Center for the Book]], the Center for Information as Evidence, and the California Rare Book School, among many other institutes, programs, and research centers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gseis.ucla.edu/research/ "Research at GSE&amp;IS."] UCLA Graduate School of Education and Information Studies. Retrieved January 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The program is known for having a diverse teaching faculty who come from many countries around the world. There are also many adjunct faculty members who teach at the school which adds some vocational instruction to the highly theoretical program.

== History ==
===Origins===
The University of Agriculture, Faisalabad ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|جامعہ زرعيه فيصل آباد}}}}), (formally: ''Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute''), is a [[university]] in the city of [[Faisalabad]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]]. It was established in 1906&lt;ref name=uaf&gt;http://uaf.edu.pk/faculties/agri/agri_history.html, History and Faculties of the University of Agriculture, [[Faisalabad]], Retrieved 15 Aug 2016&lt;/ref&gt; as the first major institution of higher agricultural education in the [[Punjab (British India)|undivided Punjab]].

At independence in 1947, Pakistan was a predominantly agricultural country. In spite of subsequent [[industrialization]] and development, [[agriculture]] remains central to its [[economy]]. After independence, the [[Government of Pakistan]] appointed the National Commissions on Food and Education to reform the existing [[agrarian system]] and to formulate measures for developing better agricultural potential. The commissions made a plea for the establishment of an agricultural university for research and education. It was established by upgrading the former Punjab Agricultural College and Research Institute in 1961. It was the first university built by the British Empire in 1906 with the foundation stone laying ceremony by Sir Louis Dane, the then Lieutenant and Governor of the Punjab.

The 1,950-acre campus represents both history and the present era. The new campus is lush green with a conglomeration of monolithic blocks built in modern style. The old campus is reminiscent of traditional Muslim architecture. The main campus is situated in the centre of the city (12&amp;nbsp;km northeast of the [[Faisalabad International Airport]]), about 2&amp;nbsp;km away from city centre/ clock tower.

UAF owns and operates major cultural assets such as the [[Zoology Museum]], [[UAF Art Gallery]], [[University Library]] 

The university's [[Faculty (division)|faculty]] employs more than 800 teachers.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The university has boys and girls hostels. It accommodates over 5,000 students and approximately 3,000 day scholars. Premier hostels are Jinnah Hostel (named after the founder of Pakistan [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]]), [[Muhammad Iqbal|Iqbal]] Hall, [[Fatima Jinnah]] Hostel and [[Haley Hall]].

==Organisation and administration==
===Faculties and departments===
UAF is organised into faculties of Agriculture, Agricultural Engineering and Technology, Food Nutrition and Home Economics, Social sciences, Animal Husbandry, Food Sciences, Biotechnology, Biochemistry, Plant and Animal Breeding, Veterinary Science, Doctor of Pharmacy, Mathematics, Statistics and Sciences. A community college is on the main [[campus]] in [[Faisalabad]]. The College of Veterinary Sciences at [[Lahore]] was affiliated and is now a distinct entity known as the [[University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences|University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Lahore]] (UVAS).

These units offer programmes leading to bachelor's, master's, and doctorate degrees in agriculture and allied fields. [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan|HEC]] ranks the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad as the best in the agriculture/veterinary field in Pakistan. The University of Agriculture [[Faisalabad]] ranked number 4 among the top 10 universities in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hec.gov.pk/english/universities/Documents/Ranking_Doc%20(2015).pdf, Ranking 2015- Overall Top 10 Higher Education Institutions, ranking table listings by the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]] (HEC), a [[Government of Pakistan]] governing body, Retrieved 15 Aug 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faculty of Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology, established in 1963, with its constituent departments of Agricultural Economics, Farm Management, Agricultural Marketing, Cooperation and Credit and Rural Sociology, has now been functioning for over 51 years in the University of Agriculture, Faisalabad. It has endeavored to keep abreast with requirements in terms of academic programmes/activities over these years. However, looking at the likely shape of agricultural development, the direction and quality of research and the make-up of trained manpower output in the discipline of agricultural social sciences, the future trends need to be looked into seriously so as to be able to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

A perusal of the functioning of the constituent departments of the faculty showed that over the years the programmes of some of the departments had become less demanding in academic and research output in line with the present day requirements. Especially under WTO set up, where there has been a shift from subsistence agriculture to commercial agriculture putting further pressure to shift the emphasis to resource management strategy. Therefore, there was a strong need for a meaningful restructuring and fine tuning of the faculty to meet the challenges of the emerging requirements of the economy in the coming years.

Keeping in view this need of time, the Faculty was restructured in 2012. The name of faculty was changed to Faculty of Social Sciences. The departments of Agricultural Economics, Development Economics, and Environmental &amp; Resource Economics were merged into a new institute, Institute of Agricultural &amp; Resource Economics (IARE). Professor Dr. Muhammad Ashfaq is the first director of IARE, having served from June 2012.

Institute of Agricultural and Resource Economics now offers degree programs serving the needs of society:
* BSc (Hons) Agricultural &amp; Resource Economics (4 years)

The [[Visigoths]] entered [[Hispania]] (modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) in 415, and they rose to be the dominant people there until the [[Moors|Moorish]] invasion of 711 brought their kingdom to an end.

This period in [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] art is dominated by their style. '''Visigothic art''' is generally considered in the [[English language|English]]-speaking world to be a strain of [[Migration art]], while the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking worlds generally classify it as [[Pre-Romanesque]].

Branches of Visigothic art include their [[architecture]], their crafts (especially jewellery), and even their [[Visigothic script|script]].

==Visigothic architecture==

The only remaining examples of their architecture from the 6th century are the church of [[San Cugat del Vallés]] in [[Barcelona]], the hermitage and church of [[Santa Maria de Lara]] in Burgos, [[Saint Frutuoso Chapel]] in ([[Braga]]), the [[Igreja de São Gião|church of São Gião]] in ([[Nazaré (Portugal)|Nazaré]]) and the few remnants of the church at [[Cabeza de Griego]], [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]]. However, their style developed over the next centuries, though the prime remaining examples of it are mostly rural and often run-down. Some of the characteristics of their architecture are:
* Generally [[basilica]]n in layout, sometimes a [[Greek cross]] plan or, more rarely, a combination of the two. The spaces are highly compartmentalised.
* Horseshoe [[arch]]es without [[Keystone (architecture)|keystones]].
* A rectangular, exterior [[apse]].
* Use of [[column]]s and pillars with Corinthian [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] of unique design.
* [[Barrel vault]]s with [[cupola]]s at the crosses.
* Walls of [[ashlar]] blocks, occasionally alternating with Roman brickwork.
* Decoration commonly of animal or plant motifs.

Exemplars include:
* [[Church of San Juan Bautista, Baños de Cerrato|Church of San Juan Bautista]] in [[Baños de Cerrato]] ([[province of Palencia]])
* [[Crypt of San Antolín (Palencia)|Crypt of San Antolín]] in the [[cathedral of Palencia]] ([[province of Palencia]])

The '''Wolfram Demonstrations Project''' is an organized, open-source&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~econed/issues/v40_1/2.htm Interactive Economic Models from the Wolfram Demonstrations Project] Journal of Economic Education.&lt;/ref&gt; collection of small (or medium-size) interactive programs called Demonstrations, which are meant to visually and interactively represent ideas from a range of fields. It is hosted by [[Wolfram Research]], whose stated goal is to bring computational exploration to the widest possible audience.  At its launch, it contained 1300 demonstrations&lt;ref&gt;[http://cerncourier.com/cws/product/P000002568 The Wolfram Demonstrations Project] CERN Courier June 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but has grown to over 10,000. The site won a [[Parents' Choice Award]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parents-choice.org/product.cfm?product_id=24826&amp;StepNum=1 The Wolfram Demonstrations Project] Parents Choice&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- May 2012--&gt;

==Technology==
The Demonstrations run in ''[[Mathematica]]'' 6 or above and in ''[[CDF Player|Wolfram CDF Player]]'' which is a free modified version of Wolfram's ''Mathematica'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maa.org/editorial/mathgames/mathgames_05_02_07.html Math Games] MAA Online, May 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and available for Windows, Linux and Macintosh&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificcomputing.com/Adventures-with-the-Wolfram-Demonstrations-Project.aspx Adventures with the Wolfram Demonstrations Project] John Wass, Scientific Computing&lt;/ref&gt; and can operate as a web browser plugin.

They typically consist of a very direct user interface to a graphic or visualization, which dynamically recomputes in response to user actions such as moving a slider, clicking a button, or dragging a piece of graphics. Each Demonstration also has a brief description of the concept.

Demonstrations are now easily embeddable into any website or blog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaurov|first=Vitaliy|title=Add a Wolfram Demonstration to Your Site in One Easy Step|url=http://blog.wolfram.com/2012/04/24/add-a-wolfram-demonstration-to-your-site-in-one-easy-step/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each Demonstration page includes a snippet of JavaScript code in the Share section of the sidebar.

==Topics==
The website is organized by topic: for example, science,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencebase.com/science-blog/molecular-wolfram-demonstrations.html Molecular Wolfram Demonstrations] ScienceBase&lt;/ref&gt; mathematics, computer science, art, biology, and finance. They cover a variety of levels, from elementary school mathematics to much more advanced topics such as quantum mechanics and models of biological organisms.  The site is aimed at both educators and students, as well as researchers who wish to present their ideas to the broadest possible audience.

==Process==
Wolfram Research's staff organizes and edits the Demonstrations, which may be created by any user of ''Mathematica'', then freely published&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientific-computing.com/education/archives/29 Throwing beanbags in Mathematica 6], Scientific Computing, May 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and freely downloaded. The Demonstrations are open-source, which means that they not only demonstrate the concept itself but also show how to implement it.

==Alternatives==
The use of the web to transmit small interactive programs is reminiscent of [[Sun Microsystems|Sun's]] [[Java applet]]s, [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]]'s [[Adobe Flash|Flash]], and the open-source [[Processing (programming language)|processing]]. However, those creating Demonstrations have access to the algorithmic and visualization capabilities of ''Mathematica'' making it more suitable for technical demonstrations. 

The Demonstrations Project also has similarities to user-generated content websites like [[Wikipedia]] and [[Flickr]].  Its business model is similar to Adobe's [[Adobe Acrobat|Acrobat]] and Flash strategy of charging for development tools but providing a free reader.{{fact|date=April 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32513">Women are often under-represented in the fields of engineering, both in academia and in the profession of engineering, yet many have contributed to the diverse fields of engineering historically and currently.&lt;ref name="MentorNet 2003"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK36356/|title=The Underrepresentation of Women in Engineering and Related Sciences: Pursuing Two Complementary Paths to Parity|last=MentorNet|date=2003|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of organizations and programs have been created to understand and overcome this tradition of gender disparity. Some have decried this gender gap, saying that it indicates the absence of potential talent.&lt;ref name="MentorNet 2003"/&gt; Though the gender gap as a whole is narrowing, there is still a growing gap with minority women compared to their white counterparts.&lt;ref name="MentorNet 2003"/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of women in engineering}}
The history of women as designers and builders of machines and structures predates the development of engineering as a trade. Prior to the creation of the term "[[engineer]]" in the 11th century, women had contributed to the technological advancement of societies around the globe, including [[Hypatia]] of Alexandria (350 or 370–415 AD), who is credited with the invention of the [[hydrometer]]. By the 19th century, women who participated in engineering work often had academic training in mathematics or science. [[Ada Lovelace]] was privately schooled in mathematics before beginning her collaboration with [[Charles Babbage]] on his [[analytical engine]] that would earn her the designation of the "first computer programmer." In the early years of the 20th century, greater numbers of women began to be admitted to engineering programs, but they were generally looked upon as anomalies by the men in their departments.

The first University to award an engineering's bachelor's degree for women was [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Elizabeth Bragg was the recipient of a bachelor's degree in [[civil engineering]] in 1876, becoming the first female engineer in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="SWE"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Society of Women Engineers Blog|title=History of Women Engineers|url=http://alltogether.swe.org/2016/03/women-in-engineering-history/|website=All Together Society Of Women Engineers|publisher=Society of Women Engineers|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 19th century, it was very rare for women to earn bachelor's degree in any field because they did not have the opportunity to enroll in universities due to gender disparities. Some universities started to admit women to their colleges by the early 1800s and by the mid-1800s they started to admit them into all academic programs including engineering.&lt;ref name="SWE" /&gt;{{Women in society sidebar}}

The entry of the United States into [[World War II]] created a serious shortage of engineering talent in that country as men were drafted into the armed forces. To address the shortage, initiatives like [[General Electric Corporation|GE]] on-the-job engineering training for women with degrees in mathematics and physics and the [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation|Curtiss-Wright]] Engineering Program among others created new opportunities for women in engineering.  [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation|Curtiss-Wright]] partnered with [[Cornell]], [[Penn State]], [[Purdue]], the [[University of Minnesota]], the [[University of Texas]], [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], and [[Iowa State University]] to create an engineering curriculum that lasted ten months and focused primarily on aircraft design and production.&lt;ref name="Bix"&gt;Bix, Amy Sue, "'Engineeresses' Invade Campus: Four decades of debate over technical coeducation." ''IEEE Technology and Society Magazine,'' Vol. 19 Nr. 1 (Spring 2000), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, since the female representation in the engineering field, there were barely public attacks on women. Chiefly, these attacks were kept quiet inside institutions due to the fact that women did not pressure aggressively to shift the [[gender pay gap|gender gap]] between men and women in the engineering field. Another reason why these “attacks” were kept private is due to how men believed that it was impossible for engineering to stop being a male-dominated field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bix|first1=Amy Sue|title=Girls coming to tech! : a history of American engineering education for women|date=2013|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262019545|pages=14–43|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=773eea71-2e88-4f93-bd10-b06fb8ced6d5%40sessionmgr103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=691931&amp;db=nlebk|ref=Girls Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's roles in the workforce, specifically in engineering fields changed greatly during the Post–World War II period. As women started to marry at later ages, have fewer children, divorce more frequently and stopped depending on [[Breadwinner model|male breadwinners]] for economic support, they started to become even more active in the engineering labor force despite the fact that their salaries were less than men's.&lt;ref name="Power Status Stereotypes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yang|first1=Juemei|title=The impact of power status on gender stereotypes, sexism, and gender discrimination toward women in the workplace and the career identity development of women|date=2016|publisher=The University of North Dakota|location=The University of North Dakota|pages=1–20|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women also played a crucial role in programming the [[ENIAC]] from its construction during the [[World War II]] period through the next several decades. Originally recruited by the Army in 1943, female ENIAC programmers made considerable advancements in [[Computer programming|programming]] techniques, such as the invention of breakpoints, now a standard debugging tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abbate|first1=Janet|title=Recoding Gender: Women's Changing Participation in Computing|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/recoding-gender|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the wartime shortage of engineers, women also made inroads in engineering fields due to the gradual increase in public universities admitting female students. For example, [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] began to admit women engineering students in 1952, while the [[École Polytechnique]] in Paris, a premier French engineering institution, began to admit female students in 1972.

==Factors contributing to lower female participation==
===Gender stereotypes===

[[Stereotype threat]] may contribute to the under-representation of women in engineering. Because engineering is a traditionally male-dominated field, women may be less confident about their abilities, even when performing equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ruff|first2=Chloe|last3=Paretti|first3=Marie C.|date=2013|title=The impact of engineering identification and stereotypes on undergraduate women’s achievement and persistence in engineering|journal=Social Psychology of Education An International Journal|last1=Jones|first1=Brett D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a young age, girls do not express the same level of interest in engineering as boys, possibly due in part to [[gender stereotypes]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite paper|last=Hill|first=Catherine|last2=Corbett|first2=Christine|last3=St. Rose|first3=Andresse|year=2010|title=Why So Few?: Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED509653.pdf|publisher=[[AAUW]]|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also significant evidence of the remaining presence of [[implicit bias]] against female engineers, due to the belief that men are mathematically superior and better suited to engineering jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women who persist are able to overcome these difficulties, enabling them to find fulfilling and rewarding experiences in the engineering profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bilimoria|first2=Diana|last3=Perelli|first3=Sheri|date=2013|title=Why they stay: women persisting in US engineering careers|journal=Career Development International|volume=18.2|pages=139–154|last1=Buse|first1=Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Due to this [[gender bias]], women's choice in entering an engineering field for college is also highly correlated to the background and exposure they have had with [[mathematics]] and other science courses during high school. Most women that do choose to study engineering have significant experience with regarding themselves better at these types of courses and as a result, think they are capable of studying in a male-dominated field.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell" /&gt;

Women's [[self-efficacy]] is also a contributor to the [[gender stereotype]] that plays a role in the underrepresentation of women in engineering.  Women's ability to think critically that they can be successful and perform accomplishments is correlated to the choices they have when choosing a college career. Women that show high self-efficacy personalities are more prone to choose to study in the engineering field. Self-efficacy is also correlated to gender roles because men often present higher self-efficacy than women, which can also be a cause to why when choosing a major, most women opt to not choose the engineering major.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blaisdell|first1=Stephanie|title=Factors In The Underrepresentation Of Women In Science and Engineering: A Review Of The Literature|journal=Penn State University|date=1994|pages=167–168|url=https://journals.psu.edu/wepan/article/viewFile/57727/57415|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower rates of female students in engineering degree programs===
Over the past few years 40 percent of women are leaving the engineering field, there are many factors leading to why they don't go into engineering because of women being judged about going into a difficult major such as engineering, working in difficult workplace conditions. According to the Society of Women Engineers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/female-engineers_n_5668504.html|title=40 Percent Of Female Engineers Are Leaving The Field. This Might Be Why.|last=Adams|first=Rebecca|date=2014-08-12|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; one in four female leave the field after a certain age.

Women are under-represented in engineering education programs as in the workforce (see [[Women in engineering#Statistics|Statistics]]). Enrollment and graduation rates of women in post-secondary engineering programs are very important determinants of how many women go on to become engineers. Because undergraduate degrees are acknowledged as the "latest point of standard entry into scientific fields", the under-representation of women in undergraduate programs contributes directly to under-representation in scientific fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Programs for Undergraduate Women in Science and Engineering: Issues, Problems, and Solutions |journal=Gender &amp; Society |first=Mary |last=Fox|first2=Gerhard |last2=Sonnert |first3=Irina |last3=Nikiforova | year=2011| volume=25 | issue=5| page=591 | doi=10.1177/0891243211416809}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the United States, women who hold degrees in science, technology, and engineering fields are less likely than their male counterparts to have jobs in those fields.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This degree disparity varies across engineering disciplines. Women tend to be more interested in the engineering disciplines that have societal and humane developments, such as agricultural and [[environmental engineering]]. They are therefore well-represented in environmental and [[biomedical engineering]] degree programs, receiving 40-50% of awarded degrees in the U.S. (2014–15), women are far less likely to receive degrees in fields like [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[Electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[computer engineering]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoder|first=Brian L.|year=2015|title=Engineering by the Numbers|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/engineering_by_the_numbers.pdf|journal=|publisher=American Society for Engineering Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="franzway" /&gt;

A study made by the [[Harvard Business Review]] discussed the reasons why the rates of women representation in the engineering field are still low. The study discovered that rates of female students in engineering programs are continuous because of the collaboration aspects in the field. The results of the study chiefly determined how women are treated differently in group works in which there are more male than female members and how male members “excluded women from the real engineering work”. Aside from this, women in this study also described how professors treated female students differently “just because they were women”.&lt;ref name="HBR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Silbey|first1=Susan S.|title=Why Do So Many Women Who Study Engineering Leave the Field?|url=https://hbr.org/2016/08/why-do-so-many-women-who-study-engineering-leave-the-field|website=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that fewer women enroll in engineering programs across the nation, the representation of women in STEM-based careers can potentially increase when college and university administrators work on implementing mentoring programs and work-life policies for women. 
Research shows that these rates have a hard time increasing since women are judged as less competent than men to perform supposedly “masculine jobs”.&lt;ref name="Eric" /&gt;

=== Engineering culture ===
[[File:2009 Bay Area Maker Faire - Jeri.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Autodidacticism|Autodidact]] computer chip designer and inventor, [[Jeri Ellsworth]], at the [https://makerfaire.com/bay-area/ Bay Area "Maker Faire"] in 2009.|alt=Jeri Ellsworth]]Another possible reason for lower female participation in engineering fields is the prevalence of values "associated with the male [[gender role]]" in workplace culture.&lt;ref name="franzway" /&gt;  For example, some women in engineering have found it difficult to re-enter the workforce after a period of absence. Because men are less likely to take time off to raise a family, this disproportionately affects women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evetts|first1=Julia|title=Women and management in engineering: The 'glass ceiling' for|journal=Women in Management Review|date=1993|volume=8.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males are also associated with taking leadership roles in the workplace. By holding a position of power over the women, they may create an uncomfortable environment for them. For example, lower pay, more responsibilities, less appreciation as compared to men.

[[Communication]] is also a contributing factor to the divide between men and women in the workplace. A male to male communication is said to be more direct,&lt;ref name=Dutta&gt;Dutta, Debalina1. "Sustaining The Pipeline: Experiences Of International Female Engineers In U.S. Graduate Programs." Journal of Engineering Education 104.3 (2015): 326-344. Education Source.&lt;/ref&gt;
but when a man explains a task to a woman, they tend to talk down, or “dumb down” terms. This comes from the [[stereotype]] that men are more qualified than women for engineering, causing men to treat women as inferiors instead of equals.

Part of the [[Male privilege|male dominance]] in the engineering field is explained by their perception towards engineering itself. A study in 1964 found that both women and men believed that engineering was in fact masculine.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blaisdell|first1=Stephanie|title=Factors In The Underrepresentation Of Women In Science And Engineering: A Review Of The Literature|journal=Penn State University|date=1994|pages=169–170|ref=https://journals.psu.edu/wepan/article/viewFile/57727/57415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The masculinity dominating engineering majors and fields proves the issues that men themselves believe that they “naturally” excel in fields related to mathematics and sciences while women “naturally” excel in linguistics and liberal arts. In the past few decades, women's representation in the workforce in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] fields, specifically engineering, has significantly improved. In 1960 women made up around 1% of all the engineers and by the year 2000 women have made up 11% of all engineers.&lt;ref name="Eric"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill, Ph.D.|first1=Catherine|last2=Corbett|first2=Christiane|last3=St. Rose, Ed.D.|first3=Andresse|title=Why So Few?: Women In Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED509653|website=ERIC Institute of Education Sciences|publisher=AAUW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several colleges and universities nationwide want to decrease the [[gender pay gap|gender gap]] between men and women in the engineering field by recruiting more women into their programs. The strategies used for recruiting more female undergraduate students are: increasing women's exposure to stem-courses during high school, planting the idea of positivism relating gender from the engineering culture, producing a more female-friendly environment inside and outside the classroom.  These strategies have helped institutions encourage more women to enroll in engineering programs as well as other [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]-based majors. 
For universities to encourage women to enroll in their [[graduate programs]], institutions have to emphasize the importance of recruiting women, emphasize the importance of STEM education in the undergraduate level, offer financial aid, and develop more efficient methods for recruiting women to their programs.&lt;ref name="Recruiting"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Committee on the Guide to Recruiting and Advancing Women Scientists and Engineers in Academia, Committee on Women in Science and Engineering, and National Research Council|title=To Recruit and Advance : Women Students and Faculty in U.S. Science and Engineering|date=2006|publisher=National Academic Press|pages=26-26|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Females are underrepresented as both graduate students in engineering and working engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www7.nationalacademies.org/cwse/S_E_stats.pdf |title=Data on Women in S&amp;E |page=4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819125228/http://www7.nationalacademies.org/cwse/S_E_stats.pdf |archivedate=August 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.nationalacademies.org/pga/cwsem/index.htm|title=Committee on Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine|publisher=Committee on Women in Science, Engineering, and Medicine|accessdate=10 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of bachelor's degrees awarded to women dropped from 20.4% in 2003, down to 17.8% in 2009, and back up to 18.9% in 2012.&lt;ref name="Yoder"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yoder|first1=Brian|title=Engineering by the Numbers|url=http://www.asee.org/papers-and-publications/publications/11-47.pdf|website=ASEE|publisher=American Society for Engineering Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women's underrepresentation in the engineering workforce varies by field. In the year 2008 women [[Mechanical Engineers]] made up 6.7%, [[Electrical engineering|Electrical]] and [[Electronic engineering|Electronics]] made 7.7%, [[Aerospace engineering|Aerospace]] and [[Civil engineering|Civil]] made 10.4%, [[Chemical engineering|Chemical]] made 13.1% and [[Computer engineering|Computer]] and [[Software engineer|Software Engineers]] made up 20.9% of the workforce. These values are even more outnumbered while quantifying the number of women who hold [[doctorates]].&lt;ref name="Eric" /&gt;

The percentage of [[master's degrees]] awarded to women has not changed much from 2003 (22.3%) to 2012 (23.1%).&lt;ref name="Yoder" /&gt; The percentage of doctoral degrees awarded to women in engineering increased from 11.6% in 1995, to 17.4% in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf06308/pdf/tab2.pdf | title=Table 2. Doctorates awarded to women, by field of study: 1995–2004| publisher=National Science Foundation|accessdate=10 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 21.1% in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Jaschik,
[http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2010/09/14/doctorates Women Lead in Doctorates], ''Inside Higher Ed,'' September 14, 2010 (accessed June 18, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; then to 22.2% in 2012.&lt;ref name=Yoder /&gt;

Since 1997, the percentage of Asian females enrolling in engineering majors has risen from about 30% to 34% but somehow also dropped in 2002. African American females have increased their representation in engineering from 21% to 33% in the same time frame. Mexican American (Chicana) and Puerto Rican females have had an increase in their representation from 25% to 31%. Even if ethnicities are included in these statistics, men from all ethnicities still outnumber the proportion of women who enroll in engineering bachelor programs.&lt;ref name="Recruiting" /&gt;

There is a significant drop-off rate regarding the number of women who earn a bachelor's degree and the women who afterward enroll in graduate school. Over the last 35 years, women have been more likely than men to enroll in graduate school right after receiving their bachelor's degree. Women who do not enroll in a graduate program right after earning their bachelor's degree tend to be caregivers who face work-family conflicts in the context of family women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Committee on the Guide to Recruiting and Advancing Women Scientists and Engineers in Academia|last2=Committee on Women in Science and Engineering|last3=National Research Council|title=To Recruit and Advance : Women Students and Faculty in U.S. Science and Engineering|pages=14–47|ref=Recruiting}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The workforce remains the area of lowest representation for women. In 2009, women comprised 48% of the total workforce, but only 14% of the engineering workforce.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Australia===
Only 14% of engineers in [[Australia]] are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robogals.org/about/who-what-why/|title=Who, What, Why|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Robogals|accessdate=10 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retention of female engineers is also disproportionally low; in 2006, 62.6% of qualified male engineers were employed in engineering professions, as opposed to 47.1% of qualified female engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaspura|first=Andre|year=2014|title=THE ENGINEERING PROFESSION: A STATISTICAL OVERVIEW|url=http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/sites/default/files/shado/Resources/the_engineering_profession_a_statistical_overview_11th_ed._october_2014.pd|journal=|publisher=Engineers Australia|volume=11|pages=117|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Though women tend to make up more than half of the undergraduate population in [[Canada]], the number of women in engineering is disproportionately low.&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/career-advice/why-more-women-arent-becoming-engineers/article1216432/|title=Why more women aren't becoming engineers |last=Myers|first=Jennifer|date=9 Nov 2010|accessdate=24 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in 2001, 21 percent of students in engineering programs were female, by 2009, this had fallen to 17 percent.&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt; One commentator attributed this drop to a number of factors, such as the failure of higher education programs to explain how engineering can improve others' lives, a lack of awareness of what engineers do, and discomfort of being in a male-dominated environment and the perception that women must adapt to fit in.&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt;

In the 1990s, undergraduate enrollment of women in engineering fluctuated from 17 to 18%, while in 2001, it rose to 20.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/e/pr_women.cfm|title=Women in Engineering|publisher=Engineers Canada|accessdate=30 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 17.7% of students in undergraduate engineering were women.&lt;ref name="Canada1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/files/w_report_enrolment_eng.pdf|title=Canadian Engineers for Tomorrow: Trends in Engineering Enrolment and Degrees Awarded 2006 to 2010|publisher=Engineers Canada|accessdate=30 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female undergraduate enrollment was highest in 2010 in [[Environmental engineering|environmental]], [[Biosystems engineering|biosystems]], and [[geological engineering]].&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt;

The number of women enrolled in undergraduate, graduate, and doctoral engineering programs tends to vary by province, with the highest number in [[Saskatchewan]],  [[Alberta]], and [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt;

On average, 11% of engineering faculty are women and the percentage of leadership roles held by women is an average of 9%.&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt; The [[University of Toronto]] has the highest female faculty rate in Canada at 17% and [[École Polytechnique de Montréal]],  [[University of British Columbia]], and [[Dalhousie University]] all have a female faculty rate of 13%.&lt;ref name="Canada1" /&gt;

In 2011, the INWES Education and Research Institute (ERI) held a national workshop, Canadian Committee of Women in Engineering (CCWE+20), to determine ways of increasing the number of women in the engineering field in Canada.&lt;ref name="ccwe20"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uottawa.ca/media/media-release-2376.html|title=Canada needs more women engineers—how do we get there?|date=26 Jul 2011|accessdate=24 May 2013|publisher=University of Ottawa}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCWE+20 identified a goal of increasing women's interest in engineering by 2.6 percent by 2016 to a total of 25 percent through more incentives such as through collaboration and special projects.&lt;ref name="ccwe20" /&gt; The workshop identifies early education as one of the main barriers in addition to other factors, such as: "the popular culture of their generation, the guidance they receive on course selection in high school and the extent to which their parents, teachers, and counselors recognize engineering as an appropriate and legitimate career choice for women."&lt;ref name="ccwe20" /&gt; The workshop report compares enrollment, teaching, and professional statistics from the goals identified in 1997 compared to the actual data from 2009, outlining areas of improvement (see table, right).
