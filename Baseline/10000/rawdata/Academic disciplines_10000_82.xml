Regulations that define and limit the [[concentration]] of [[pollutant]]s in the ambient air or in gaseous [[Air pollutants|emission]]s to the ambient air are issued by various national and state (or provincial) [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|environmental protection]] and [[United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration|occupational health and safety]] agencies.

Such regulations involve a number of different expressions of concentration.  Some express the concentrations as ppmv ([[parts per million]] by volume) and some express the concentrations as  mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (milligrams per cubic meter), while others require adjusting or correcting the concentrations to reference conditions of moisture content, [[oxygen]] content or [[carbon dioxide]] content. This article presents methods for converting concentrations from ppmv to mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (and vice versa) and for correcting the concentrations to the required reference conditions.

All of the concentrations and concentration corrections in this article apply only to air and other gases. They are not applicable for liquids.

==Converting air pollutant concentrations==

The conversion equations depend on the temperature at which the conversion is wanted (usually about 20 to 25&amp;nbsp;°C).  At an ambient sea level atmospheric pressure of 1 [[atmosphere (unit)|atm]] (101.325 [[Pascal (unit)|kPa]] or [[Bar (unit)|1.01325 bar]]), the general equation is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{ppmv} = \mathrm{mg}/\mathrm{m}^3\cdot \frac{(0.082057338\cdot T)}{M}&lt;/math&gt;

and for the reverse conversion:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{mg}/\mathrm{m}^3 = \mathrm{ppmv}\cdot \frac{M}{(0.082057338\cdot T)}&lt;/math&gt;

{| class="wikitable" border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
|align=right| '''mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''
|align=left|= milligrams of pollutant per cubic meter of air at sea level atmospheric pressure and '''''T'''''

|}

Notes:
* 1 atm = absolute pressure of 101.325 kPa or 1.01325 [[bar (unit)|bar]]
* mol = [[mole (unit)|gram mole]] and kmol = 1000&amp;nbsp;gram moles
* Pollution regulations in the United States typically reference their pollutant limits to an ambient temperature of 20 to 25&amp;nbsp;°C as noted above. In most other nations, the reference ambient temperature for pollutant limits may be 0&amp;nbsp;°C or other values.
* Although ppmv and mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; have been used for the examples in all of the following sections, concentrations such as ppbv (i.e., parts per billion by volume), volume percent, mole percent and many others may also be used for gaseous pollutants.
*[[Atmospheric particulate matter|Particulate matter]] (PM) in the atmospheric air or in any other gas cannot be expressed in terms of  ppmv, ppbv, volume percent or mole percent. PM is most usually (but not always) expressed as mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of air or other gas at a specified temperature and pressure.
* For gases, volume percent = mole percent
* 1 volume percent = 10,000 ppmv (i.e., parts per million by volume) with a million being defined as 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;.
* Care must be taken with the concentrations expressed as ppbv to differentiate between the British billion which is 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; and the USA billion which is 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; (also referred to as the long scale and short scale billion, respectively).

==Correcting concentrations for altitude==

Air pollutant concentrations expressed as mass per unit volume of atmospheric air (e.g., mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, µg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, etc.) at sea level will decrease with increasing [[altitude]]. The concentration decrease is directly proportional to the pressure decrease with increasing altitude. Some governmental regulatory jurisdictions require industrial sources of air pollution to comply with sea level standards corrected for altitude. In other words, industrial air pollution sources located at altitudes well above sea level must comply with significantly more stringent air quality standards than sources located at sea level (since it is more difficult to comply with lower standards). For example, [[New Mexico]]'s Department of the Environment has a regulation with such a requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.complextransformationspeis.com/eis0236/vol4/v4c3.htm Draft Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for Stockpile Stewardship and Management] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828074108/http://www.complextransformationspeis.com/eis0236/vol4/v4c3.htm |date=2008-08-28 }}(See section 03.05 of the EIS which involves the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] in New Mexico)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blm.gov/pgdata/etc/medialib/blm/nm/field_offices/socorro/socorro_planning/socorro.Par.77588.File.dat/Final_Air_Quality_Impact_Analysis.pdf Air Quality Impact Analysis] (Developed for the [[United States Bureau of Land Management]], Socorro Field Office, New Mexico)&lt;/ref&gt;

The change of atmospheric pressure with altitude (&lt;20&amp;nbsp;km) can be obtained from this equation:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atec.army.mil/publications/Mil-Std-810F/Mil-Std-810F.pdf United States Department of Defense MIL-STD-810F], 1 January 2000. (See: Annex A, page 520.2A5 )&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;P_\mathrm h = P\,\cdot\bigg(\frac{288 - 6.5 h}{288}\bigg)^{5.2558}&lt;/math&gt;

Given an air pollutant concentration at sea-level atmospheric pressure, the concentration at higher altitudes can be obtained from this equation:

:&lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm h = C\,\cdot\bigg(\frac{288 - 6.5 h}{288}\bigg)^{5.2558}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
!align=right| '''h'''
|align=left|= altitude, in km
|-
!align=right| '''''P'''''
|align=left|= atmospheric pressure at sea level
|-
!align=right| '''''P'''''&lt;sub&gt;'''h'''&lt;/sub&gt;
|align=left|= atmospheric pressure at altitude '''h'''
|-
!align=right| '''''C'''''&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp;
|align=left|= Air pollutant concentration, in mass per unit volume at sea level atmospheric pressure and specified temperature T
|-
!align=right| '''''C'''''&lt;sub&gt;'''h'''&lt;/sub&gt;
|align=left|= Concentration, in mass per unit volume at altitude '''h''' and specified temperature T
|}

As an example, given an air pollutant concentration of 260&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at sea level, calculate the equivalent pollutant concentration at an altitude of 2800 meters:

:'''''C'''''&lt;sub&gt;'''h'''&lt;/sub&gt; = 260 × [ { 288 - (6.5)(2.8) } / 288]&lt;sup&gt; 5.2558&lt;/sup&gt; = 260 × 0.71 = 185 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

Note:
* The above equation for the decrease of air pollution concentrations with increasing altitude is applicable only for about the first 10&amp;nbsp;km of altitude in the [[troposphere]] (the lowest atmospheric layer) and is estimated to have a maximum error of about 3 percent. However, 10&amp;nbsp;km of altitude is sufficient for most purposes involving air pollutant concentrations.

==Correcting concentrations for reference conditions==

Many environmental protection agencies have issued regulations that limit the concentration of pollutants in gaseous [[Emission standards|emissions]] and define the reference conditions applicable to those concentration limits.  For example, such a regulation might limit the concentration of [[Nitrogen oxide|NOx]] to 55 ppmv in a dry combustion [[exhaust gas]] (at a specified reference temperature and pressure) corrected to 3 volume percent [[Oxygen|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in the dry gas.  As another example, a regulation might limit the concentration of total particulate matter to 200&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of an emitted gas (at a specified reference temperature and pressure) corrected to a dry basis and further corrected to 12 volume percent [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in the dry gas.

Environmental agencies in the USA often use the terms "dscf" or "scfd" to denote a "standard" cubic foot of dry gas.  Likewise, they often use the terms "dscm" or "scmd" to denote a "standard" cubic meter of gas. Since there is no universally accepted set of "standard" temperature and pressure, such usage can be and is very confusing. It is strongly recommended that the reference temperature and pressure always be clearly specified when stating gas volumes or gas flow rates.

===Correcting to a dry basis===

If a gaseous emission sample is analyzed and found to contain water vapor and a pollutant concentration of say 40 ppmv, then 40 ppmv should be designated as the "wet basis" pollutant concentration.  The following equation can be used to correct the measured "wet basis" concentration to a "[[dry basis]]" concentration:

:&lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm{dry\, basis} = \frac{C_\mathrm{wet\, basis}}{1 - w}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
!align=right|'''''C'''''
|align left|= Concentration of the air pollutant in the emitted gas
|-
!align=right|'''''w''''' 
|align=left|= fraction of the emitted exhaust gas, by volume, which is water vapor
|}

As an example, a wet basis concentration of 40 ppmv in a gas having 10 volume percent water vapor would have a:

:'''''C'''''&lt;sub&gt;'''dry basis'''&lt;/sub&gt; = 40 ÷ ( 1 - 0.10 ) = 44.4 ppmv.

===Correcting to a reference oxygen content===

The following equation can be used to correct a measured pollutant concentration in a dry emitted gas with a measured O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content to an equivalent pollutant concentration in a dry emitted gas with a specified reference amount of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name=Lewandowski&gt;{{cite book|author=David A. Lewandowski|title=Design of Thermal Oxidation Systems for Volatile Organic Compounds|edition=1st|publisher=CRC Press|year=1999|isbn=1-56670-410-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm r = C_\mathrm m\cdot\frac{(20.9 - \mathrm{reference\,volume\, \%\, O_2})}{(20.9 - \mathrm {measured\,volume\, \%\, O_2})}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
!align=right| '''''C'''''&lt;sub&gt;'''r'''&lt;/sub&gt;
|align=left|= corrected concentration of a dry gas with a specified reference volume % O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
!align=right| '''''C'''''&lt;sub&gt;'''m'''&lt;/sub&gt;
|align=left|= measured concentration in a dry gas having a measured volume % O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

As an example,  a measured NOx concentration of 45 ppmv in a dry gas having 5 volume % O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is:

:45 × ( 20.9 - 3 ) ÷ ( 20.9 - 5 ) = 50.7 ppmv of NOx

when corrected to a dry gas having a specified reference O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content of 3 volume %.

Note:
* The measured gas concentration '''''C'''''&lt;sub&gt;'''m'''&lt;/sub&gt; must first be corrected to a dry basis before using the above equation.

===Correcting to a reference carbon dioxide content===

The following equation can be used to correct a measured pollutant concentration in an emitted gas (containing a measured CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content) to an equivalent pollutant concentration in an emitted gas containing a specified reference amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name=Lewandowski/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_\mathrm r = C_\mathrm m\cdot\frac {(\mathrm{reference\,volume\,\%\,CO_2})}{(\mathrm{measured\,volume\,\%\,CO_2})}&lt;/math&gt;

{| border="0" cellpadding="2"
|-
|align=right|where:
|&amp;nbsp;
|-
!align=right| '''''C'''''&lt;sub&gt;'''r'''&lt;/sub&gt;
|align=left|= corrected concentration of a dry gas having a specified reference volume % CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|-
!align=right| '''''C'''''&lt;sub&gt;'''m'''&lt;/sub&gt;
|align=left|= measured concentration of a dry gas having a measured volume % CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|}
 
As an example, a measured particulates concentration of 200&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in a dry gas that has a measured 8 volume % CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is:

:200 × ( 12 ÷ 8 ) = 300 mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

when corrected to a dry gas having a specified reference CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content of 12 volume %.

'''Argus retinal prosthesis''', also known as a '''bionic eye''', is an electronic [[retinal implant]] manufactured by the [[United States|American]] company Second Sight Medical Products. It is used as a [[visual prosthesis]] to improve the vision of people with severe cases of [[retinitis pigmentosa]]. The Argus II version of the system was approved for marketing in the [[European Union]] in March 2011, and it received approval in the US in February 2013 under a [[humanitarian device exemption]].  The Argus II system costs about US$150,000, excluding the cost of the implantation surgery and training to learn to use the device.

==Medical use==
The Argus II is specifically designed to treat people with [[retinitis pigmentosa]].&lt;ref name=Chuang2014rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chuang|first1=AT|last2=Margo|first2=CE|last3=Greenberg|first3=PB|title=Retinal implants: a systematic review|journal=The British Journal of Ophthalmology|date=July 2014|volume=98|issue=7|pages=852–6|pmid=24403565|doi=10.1136/bjophthalmol-2013-303708}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device was approved with data from a single-arm [[clinical trial]] that enrolled thirty people with severe retinitis pigmentosa; the longest follow-up on a trial subject was 38.3 months.&lt;ref name=Chuang2014rev/&gt; People in the trial received the implant in only one eye and tests were conducted with the device switched on, or switched off as a control.&lt;ref name=NICEinterventionalRev/&gt; With the device switched on, about 23% of the subjects had improvements in their [[visual acuity|ability to see]]; all had been at 2.9 or higher on the [[LogMAR chart|LogMAR scale]] and improvements ranged from just under 2.9 to 1.6 LogMAR – the equivalent of 20/1262 reading ability.&lt;ref name=Chuang2014rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=NICEinterventionalRev/&gt;{{rp|18}} 96% of the subjects were better able to identify a white square on a black computer screen; 57% were more able to determine the direction in which a white bar moved across a black computer screen. With the device switched on, about 60% were able to accurately walk to a door that was 20 feet away, as opposed to only 5% with the device switched off; 93% had no change in their perception of light.&lt;ref name=NICEinterventionalRev/&gt;{{rp|18}}

==Side effects==
Among the thirty subjects in the clinical trial, there were nine serious adverse events recorded, including lower than normal [[intraocular pressure]], erosion of the [[conjunctiva]], [[wound dehiscence|reopening of the surgical wound]], [[endophthalmitis|inflammation inside the eye]], and [[retinal detachments]].&lt;ref name=Chuang2014rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=NICEinterventionalRev/&gt;{{rp|19}}  There is also a risk of bacterial infection from the implanted cables that connect the implant to the signal processor.&lt;ref name=Chuang2014rev/&gt;

==Surgical procedure==
The implantation procedure takes several hours, with the person receiving the implant under [[general anaesthesia]]. The surgeon [[Vitrectomy|removes the vitreous humor]] and any membranes on the retina where the implant will be placed. The implant is attached to the surface of the retina with a tack. The cables connecting the implant to the processor are run through the [[pars plana]], a region near where the [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] and [[sclera]] touch.&lt;ref name=NICEinterventionalRev&gt;[https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ipg519/evidence/insertion-of-an-epiretinal-prosthesis-for-retinitis-pigmentosa-overview2 "IPG519: Interventional procedure overview of insertion of an epiretinal prosthesis for retinitis pigmentosa"]. [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] Interventional Procedures Programme. Updated December 2014. Retrieved 4 September 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Device==
The Argus implant's primary external element is a [[digital camera]] mounted on eyeglass frames, which obtains images of the user's surroundings; signals from the camera are transmitted wirelessly to a computerised image processor. The processor is in turn connected by cables to the implant itself, which is surgically implanted on the surface of the person's retina and tacked into place. The implant consists of 60 [[electrode]]s, each 200 [[micron]]s in diameter.&lt;ref name=Chuang2014rev/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/02/15/fda-clears-argus-ii-bionic-eye-for-sale-in-the-us-video/|title=FDA clears Argus II 'bionic eye' for sale in the US (video)|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=15 February 2013|accessdate=17 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The implant's manufacturer, Second Sight Medical Products, was founded in [[Sylmar]], California, in 1998, by Alfred Mann, Samuel Williams, and Gunnar Bjorg.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald D. White. [http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-stock-spotlight-eyes-20150316-story.html "With 'bionic eye' booming, Second Sight is on analysts' radar"]. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. 16 March 2015.

The '''Bio21 Institute of Molecular Science and Biotechnology''', abbreviated as the '''Bio21 Institute''', is an Australian scientific research [[research institute|institute]] focuses on the study of basic science and applied biotechnology. The Bio21 Institute is based at the [[University of Melbourne]] on [[Flemington Road, Melbourne|Flemington Road]] in {{VICcity|Parkville}}, [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

The Institute is managed by the University of Melbourne and is supported by funding from the Victorian Government.

==History==
Established in 2002 and officially opened in 2005, the research centre conducts interdisciplinary learning and houses research groups specializing in biochemistry, cell biology, chemistry, and other life sciences. Bio21 accommodates over 500 research scientists, students and industry participants, making it one of the largest biotechnology research centres in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bio21.unimelb.edu.au/about-bio21 |title=About Bio21 |date=2015 |accessdate=13 September 2016 |website=www.bio21.unimelb.edu.au |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095837/http://www.bio21.unimelb.edu.au/about-bio21 |archivedate=2 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=September 2016}}

In September 2006, Bio21 formed a partnership with Australian-based global bio-pharmaceutical company [[CSL Limited]]. 50 scientists from CSL were relocated to participate in activities at the Bio21. The goal of the partnership was for Bio21 to gain the expertise of industry professionals and for CSL to gain access to state-of-the-art equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CSL scientists move to Melbourne Uni |work=NineMSN |agency=[[Australian Associated Press|AAP]] |date=2006 |url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=65820 |accessdate=1 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920095034/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=65820 |archivedate=20 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=Rebecca |title=Bio21 Inst to host CSL scientists |journal=UniNews |volume=15 |number=17 |publisher=[[University of Melbourne]] |date=2006 |url=http://uninews.unimelb.edu.au/news/3671/ |accessdate=1 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912023818/http://uninews.unimelb.edu.au/news/3671/ |archivedate=12 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bride service''' has traditionally been portrayed in the [[Anthropology|anthropological]] literature as the service rendered by the [[bridegroom]] to a bride's family as a [[bride price]] or part of one (see [[dowry]]). Bride service and [[bride wealth]] models frame anthropological discussions of [[kinship]] in many regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;

Rather than seeing affinity in terms of a "compensation" model whereby individuals are exchanged as [[Object (philosophy)|object]]s, Dean’s (1995) research on Amazon bride service among the [[Urarina]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dean |first=Bartholomew |url=http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07 |title=Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia |location=Gainesville |publisher=University Press of Florida |date=2009 |isbn=978-0-8130-3378-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates how differentially situated subjects negotiate the politics of [[marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dean |first=Bartholomew |title=Forbidden fruit: infidelity, affinity and bride service among the Urarina of Peruvian Amazonia |journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute |volume=1 |number=1 |date=March 1995 |pages=87–110 |url=https://www.academia.edu/24961221}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Example==
An example of bride service occurs in the [[Hebrew Bible]], {{bibleverse||Genesis|29:16-29|NIV}}, when [[Jacob]] labored for [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] for fourteen years to marry [[Rachel]]. Originally the deal was seven years, but Laban tricked Jacob by giving him [[Leah]] on their wedding day, so Jacob had to work another seven years to obtain the girl he had originally fallen in love with, Rachel.

==Overview==
The Chile Pepper Institute is a research institute and is the only international organization that is devoted to the research, resource and education of chile peppers. The institute helps and promotes the iconic and famous [[New Mexico chile|state vegetable of New Mexico]]. CPI is located in Las Cruces, New Mexico, on the campus of New Mexico State University, and research is conducted at the Fabian Garcia Horticultural Center, where it also showcase 100-200 varieties of chile pepper from around the world. Paul W. Bosland is the current director and the co-founder of The Chile Pepper Institute, who is also a professor of horticulture at New Mexico State University, where he leads the chile breeding and genetics research program.&lt;ref name=BoslandBio&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul W.

[[Image:Dec SYSTEM BUILDING BLOCKS 1103.jpg|thumb|[[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]'s original products were individual modules, like these System Building Blocks 1103 hex-inverter cards (both sides).]]
A '''computer module''' is a selection of independent electronic circuits packaged onto a [[circuit board]] to provide a basic function within a [[computer]]. An example might be an [[Inverter (logic gate)|inverter]] or [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flop]], which would require two or more [[transistor]]s and a small number of additional supporting devices. Modules would be inserted into a chassis and then wired together to produce a larger logic unit, like an adder.

== History ==
Modules were the basic building block of most early computer designs, until they started being replaced by [[integrated circuit]]s in the 1960s, which were essentially an entire module packaged onto a single [[computer chip]]. Modules with discrete components continued to be used in specialist roles into the 1970s, notably high-speed designs like the [[CDC 8600]], but advances in chip design led to the disappearance of the discrete-component module in the 1970s.

It differs from traditional gene knockout because it targets specific genes at specific times rather than being deleted from beginning of life. Using the conditional gene knockout technique eliminates many of the side effects from traditional [[gene knockout]]. In traditional gene knockout, embryonic death from a gene [[mutation]] can occur, and this prevents scientists from studying the gene in adults. Some tissues cannot be studied properly in isolation, so the gene must be inactive in a certain tissue while remaining active in others. With this technology, scientists are able to knockout genes at a specific stage in development and study how the knockout of a gene in one tissue affects the same gene in other tissues.&lt;ref name="germline"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clarke|first1=Alan|title=Manipulating the germline: its impact on the study of carcinogenesis|journal=Carcinogenesis|date=21 March 2000|volume=21|issue=3|pages=435–441|pmid=10688863|doi=10.1093/carcin/21.3.435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cre"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhang|first1=Jian|last2=Zhao|first2=Jing|title=Conditional gene manipulation: Cre-ating a new biological era|journal=J Zheijang Univ Sci B|date=July 2012|volume=13|issue=7|pages=511–524|pmc=3390709|doi=10.1631/jzus.b1200042|pmid=22761243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
[[File:Conditional_Knockout_Mouse.jpg|frame|Diagram showing how to generate a conditional knockout mouse: A mouse containing the Cre gene and a mouse containing the lox gene were bred to generate a conditional knockout for a particular gene of interest. The mice do not naturally express Cre recombinase or lox sites, but they have been engineered to express these gene products to create the desirable offspring.]]
The most commonly used technique is the Cre-lox recombination system. The Cre recombinase enzyme specifically recognizes two lox (loci of recombination) sites within DNA and causes [[Genetic recombination|recombination]] between them. During recombination two strands of DNA exchange information. This recombination will cause a deletion or inversion of the genes between the two lox sites, depending on their orientation. An entire gene can be removed to inactivate it.&lt;ref name="zebrafish" /&gt;&lt;ref name="germline" /&gt; This whole system is inducible so a chemical can be added to knock genes out at a specific time. Two of the most commonly used chemicals are tetracycline, which activates transcription of the Cre recombinase gene and tamoxifen, which activates transport of the Cre recombinase protein to the nucleus.&lt;ref name="cre" /&gt; Only a few cell types express Cre recombinase and no mammalian cells express it so there is no risk of accidental activation of lox sites when using conditional gene knockout in mammals. Figuring out how to express Cre-recombinase in an organism tends to be the most difficult part of this technique.&lt;ref name="germline" /&gt;

==Uses==
The conditional gene knockout method is often used to model human diseases in other mammals.&lt;ref name="mouse" /&gt; It has increased scientists’ ability to study diseases, such as cancer, that develop in specific cell types or developmental stages.&lt;ref name="cre" /&gt; It is known that mutations in the BRCA1 gene are linked to breast cancer. Scientists used conditional gene knockout to delete the BRCA1 [[allele]] in mammary gland tissue in mice and found that it plays an important role in tumour suppression.&lt;ref name="germline" /&gt;

A specific gene in mouse brain thought to be involved in the onset of [[Alzheimer's disease]] which codes for the enzyme [[cyclin-dependent kinase 5]] (Cdk5) was knocked out. Such mice were found to be 'smarter' than normal mice and were able to handle complex tasks more intelligently compared to 'normal' mice bred in the laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.outsourcing-pharma.com/Preclinical-Research/Increased-intelligence-through-genetic-engineering |title=Increased intelligence through genetic engineering |accessdate=2015-05-30 |date=2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knockout Mouse Project (KOMP)==
Conditional gene knockouts in mice are often used to study human diseases because many genes produce similar phenotypes in both species. The goal of KOMP is to create knockout mutations in the embryonic stem cells for each of the 20,000 protein coding genes in mice.&lt;ref name="mouse" /&gt; The genes are knocked out because this is the best way to study their function and learn more about their role in human diseases. Some alleles in this project cannot be knocked out using traditional methods and require the specificity of the conditional gene knockout technique. Other combinatorial methods are needed to knockout the last remaining alleles. Conditional gene knockout is a time-consuming procedure and there are additional projects focusing on knocking out the remaining mouse genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guan|first1=Chunmei|last2=Ye|first2=Chao|last3=Yang|first3=Xiaomei|last4=Gao|first4=Jiangang|title=A Review of Current Large-Scale Mouse Knockout Efforts|journal=Genesis|date=2010|volume=48|issue=2|pages=73–85|doi=10.1002/dvg.20594|pmid=20095055}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KOMP projected was started in 2006 and is still ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gondo|first1=Y|title=Trends in large-scale mouse mutagenesis: from genetics to functional genomics.|journal=Nat.

'''Schluckbildchen'''; from [[Germany|German]], which means literally "swallowable pictures", are small notes of paper that have a [[sacred]] image on them with the purpose of being swallowed. They were used as a religious practice in the [[traditional medicine|folk medicine]] throughout the eighteenth to twentieth century, and were believed to possess curative powers. Frequently found in the "spiritual [[medicine chest|medicine chests"]] of devout believers at that time, by swallowing them they wished to gain these curative powers. They are to be distinguished from ''Esszettel''; from [[Germany|German]], meaning "edible notes of paper", the latter only having text written on them.

==Variations==

===''Esszettel''===
''Esszettel'' had either [[adage]]s, names of [[saint]]s, [[prayer]]s or [[bible]] verses written on them, usually in the shortened form of [[sigil (magic)|sigils]]. Occasionally, red paper was used. In [[Holstein]], for example, feverish people were given slips saying ''„Fieber bleib aus / [[Nomen nescio|N.N.]] ist nicht zu Haus“'' (fever stay away, N.N. is not at home). In Protestant regions like [[Württemberg]], [[East Frisia]], [[Oldenburg]] or [[Hamburg]], people symbolically consumed their own illness by eating a paper note that had their name, date of birth or some kind of phrase written on it. The slip was then stuck into a piece of bread or fruit, and the sick person ate it.&lt;ref name="richter-43"&gt;Richter, Sp. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Handwritten or printed ''Esszettel''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rheintaler.ch/lokales/rheintal/rt-or/Hilfreiche-Fresszettel-im-Ortsmuseum;art164,1271328 „Fresszettel“ im Ortsmuseum Rüthi-Büchel, St. Gallen, Schweiz]&lt;/ref&gt; were even used to cure animals, from  illnesses like rage disease or numbness (also called ''Fresszettel''). The [[Sator square]] was thought to help against [[Rabies]]. In the [[Upper Bavaria]]n region of ''Isarwinkel'' farmers treated their livestock with ''Esszettel'' to cure [[anthrax]].

Unfortunately, there are not many remains of such ''Esszettel'' today, one of the reasons lying in the fact that the church institutions had mostly seen ''Esszettel'' as pure [[superstition]]. Hints as to how they looked like can be found in literature, where triangle shaped ''Esszettel'' are mentioned, those not only with the purpose of being swallowed, though. The triangle shaped ''Esszettel'' had words or phrases printed on them that were repeated over and over, losing one or two letters with each repetition. That way, the sick person wished to overcome the illness bit by bit.&lt;ref name="richter-43" /&gt;

''Esszettel'' that have survived to the present day are usually remains of mass-produced stock which were sold on [[pilgrimage]] markets. These types of ''Esszettel'' were printed on stamp-like sheets of paper. They were either labeled identically or varied in a certain pattern. The latter version was called ''Lukaszettel'', and one of the printing plates used to print ''Lukaszettel'' has been preserved. Sometimes, ''Esszettel'' were printed on both sides, the back page complementing the front page. These are considered to be the oldest types of ''Esszettel''.

===''Schluckbildchen''===

''Schluckbildchen'' had a square, rectangular or round shape and a feed size of 5 to 20&amp;nbsp;mm. So they were the smallest form of devotional art design. Small pictures of the 19th century were partly bigger, like the version that was produced in [[Einsiedeln]] (32x22 mm). 
Also ''Schluckbildchen'' were produced on light sheets of paper; one sheet could hold 130 pieces. Both possible were series of one theme as well as different themes which would always have the same style.
''Schluckbildchen'' can be detected after the [[middle age]].&lt;ref&gt;Adolph Franz: ''Die kirchlichen Benediktionen im Mittelalter.'' Bd. 2, S. 454, Anm. 2. Freiburg/Br. 1909. Zitiert in Christoph Kürzeder: ''Als die Dinge heilig waren. Gelebte Frömmigkeit im Zeitalter des Barock.'' S. 130. Schnell &amp; Steiner, Regensburg 2005, {{ISBN|3-7954-1769-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to the 19th century [[copper engraving printings]] were most likely, including some notes (for example in [[Mariazell]]) which were produced with a [[woodcarving technique]]. Later, [[colour printing]] was used; in the 20th century also [[photomechanical]] reproduction of old artworks.

''Schluckbildchen'' often show the [[Virgin Mary]] as a [[picture of mercy]] in a specific [[pilgrimage location]], sometimes other saints or portrayals from Christian iconography, like the [[Nomen sacrum]] or [[Titulus INRI]]. Usually, under the theme an inscription is placed naming the location of pilgrimage or the saint that is portrayed. Frequently, someone made the effort also to put on details of the devotional art design. The symmetry of the rectangular, triangular, diamond-shaped, round or elliptical-shaped frame elements concentrated the effect of the picture on the central theme. Also effects like rays of light as well as the floating on clouds put emphasise on the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]] character of the picture.&lt;ref&gt;Schneegass, S. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

==Producer and sales==

''Esszettel'' were sold not only by merchants in pilgrimage locations, but also by [[charlatan]]s. It is passed on that a charlatan was travelling through Saxony in 1898, who gave ''Sympathiezettelchen'' (litaeral translation: sympathy notes) that were written in unreadable words, for an optional prize from 0.30 up to one Deutsche Mark to ill people to eat. ''Esszettel'' were also prescribed by a Saxon quack in 1913, known under the name “the Reinsdorf miner”.

In former times, ''Schluckbildchen'' were sold in all pilgrimage locations. Producers were (among others):
*F. Gutwein, Augsburg
*[[Johann Michael Söckler|J. M. Söckler]], Munich
*F. Pischel, Linz
*Jos. Nowohradsky, Graz
*Frères [[Benziger]], Einsiedeln.

''Brandzettel'' (literal translation: notes of fire), which were used for the recovery of animals, were available at [[Franciscan]] in [[Tölz]]. ''Schluckbildchen'' were from time to time a flourishing business of some monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Margarete Ruff: ''Zauberpraktiken als Lebenshilfe: Magie im Alltag vom Mittelalter bis heute,'' S. 154. Campus, Frankfurt/Main 2003, {{ISBN|3-593-37380-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of the seventies in the 19th century, “Schluckbildchen” were still sold in Mariazell, [[Naples]], and [[Sata Maria del Carmine]] in [[Florence]]. ''Schluckbildchen'' of [[Our Dear Virgin of Everlasting Aid]] were sold from Rome to the whole world.&lt;ref&gt;Richter, Sp. 44&lt;/ref&gt;  Ethnologist Dominik Wunderlin, department manager at the [[Museum der Kulturen Basel]], reported in 2005 that a woman`s monastery in Bavaria, which was not named in that connection, was still giving away ''Schluckbildchen'' at the entrance gate.&lt;ref&gt;Dominik Wunderlin: [http://www.hauszumdolder.ch/referat_d_wunderlin/ Volksfrömmigkeit in der Vergangenheit. Exemplarisch dargestellt an Objekten der Sammlung Dr. Edmund Müller]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
As the terms ''Schluckbildchen'' and ''Esszettel'' suggest, their main medical purpose was of spiritual nature, also called “gratia medicinalis” during the [[Baroque]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Brückner: ''Eßzettel.'' In ''Lexikon für Theologie und Kirche.'' Bd.&amp;nbsp;3, Sp.&amp;nbsp;894. Herder, Freiburg 1993, {{ISBN|3-451-22003-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''paper pills'' were either soaked in water, dissolved or added to dishes, in order to then be swallowed by the sick person. The ingestion of little pictures can be seen as a primitive and unmediated form of taking possession of the embodiment of the saint's curative power (or whoever was depicted). Both the ritual effort that was made to grasp the true meaning of the cult image, but also the memory of the pilgrimage adventure the sick person associated with the ''Schluckbildchen'', increased the miraculous effect. That held true despite the fact that many ''Schluckbildchen'' were hard to decipher and written in poor Latin. What remains unclear until today is the question, whether or not the consumption of ''Schluckbildchen'' was in any way connected to the practices of the [[Eucharist]] or the [[Sacramental bread]].

In rarer cases, ''Schluckbildchen'' were used as letters of protection or as religious [[amulet]]s common at that time (e.g. [[Wettersegen]] or [[Breverl]]). Furthermore, they were used as decorations for gingerbread and other pastries.

If nothing else was at hand, even holy images used in [[Anglican devotions|devotions]] were swallowed; either as a whole or torn apart and soaked in water. Lastly, it was quite common to eat images taken from [[calendar of saints|Calendars of saints]].

''Schluckbildchen'' were used in either practices of [[organized religion]] and [[folk religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Lenz Kriss-Rettenbeck: ''Bilder und Zeichen religiösen Volksglaubens.'' S. 45. [[Callwey Verlag]], München 1963&lt;/ref&gt; On August 3, 1903, the Roman [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] announced that as long as there were no superstitious practices involved, the use of ''Esszettel'' was officially granted.&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Schmidt: ''Frömmigkeit auf Abwegen'' (=Morus-Kleinschriften, Nr. 32), S. 7. Morus-Verlag, Berlin 1955. Zitiert bei Richter, Sp. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Eduard Stemplinger]] on the other hand, on July 29 the same congregation had already decided that swallowing water-soaked paper notes with Madonna images printed on them in order to heal illnesses certainly did not count as  superstition.&lt;ref name="stemplinger"&gt;Eduard Stemplinger: ''Antike und moderne Volksmedizin'' (= Das Erbe der Alten 2; 10), S. 65. Dieterich, Leipzig 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resembling objects==

''Esszettel'' were known as ''Fieberzettel'' (literal translation: fever notes) already in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]]. In Carolingian [[Indiculus superstitionum]], there was talk about a consumption of an image of deity which was baked in bread. In late Roman medicine the ash of burnt papyrus sheets („charta combusta“) was used as an ingredient for ointment and for orally and rectally applied medicine. Those notes were supposed to have a healing effect both labelled and unlabelled.

Resembling qualities to the ''Esszettel'' also has “fever altar bread” which was given away by the [[minorities]] in the end of the 18th century. [[Wafe]] was also used as healing medicine in the turn of the 15th century as it was described in the poem ''Bluemen der tugent'' by the Tyrolese Hans Vintler: ''„Vil di wellen auf oblat schreiben / und das Fieber damit vertreiben“.''

Further examples are the [[grated clay Madonna]] , which were common up to the 20th century, and from which you grated the surface to eat. For the same purpose water was used, with which relics and resembling objects were cleaned.&lt;ref name="stemplinger" /&gt; Also the “protecting notes”, which were known in the [[Thirty Years` War]] as [[art from Passau]], were also swallowed while facilitating ritual rules.

[[A printing plate]], which was found in the second decade of the 19th century in Eastern [[Mongolia]], proves that also in that culture “eating notes” were used.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walther Heissig]]: ''Heilung durch Zettelschlucken.'' In Walther Heissig, Claudius C. Müller (Hrsg.): ''Die Mongolen.'' Bd.&amp;nbsp;2. Pinguin-Verlag, Innsbruck 1989, {{ISBN|3-7016-2297-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In small squares from approx. 34x29 mm the printing plate contains several Tibetan spells that enclose also the connected purpose. Apparently, it originated from Tibetan [[Lamaistic]] folk medicine and was probably used by a Lamaistic migrant medical practitioner. Depending on the indication those notes had several instructions for use, e.g. “Eat when having flu” or “Eat nine when having stomach ache”.

From [[Uganda]] it is known that in the end of the 1990s followers of a famous Christian [[charismatic]] preacher and magic healer soaked his photographs in water and drank from it in order to swallow up parts of his healing power.&lt;ref&gt;Heike Behrend: ''Photo Magic: Photographs in Practices of Healing and Harming in East Africa.'' Journal of Religion in Africa 33, 22 (August 2003): 129–145, {{ISSN|0022-4200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first scene, a marriage is celebrated between [[Marguerite of Valois]], sister to Charles IX, and Henry of Navarre, king of Navarre, future [[Henry IV of France]]. Soon after, [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]], leader of the Calvinist French [[Huguenot]] faction, is shot to death by a man in the hire of [[Henry I, Duke of Guise]], leader of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]], an event which precipitates the [[St Bartholomew's Day Massacre]] in August 1572.

===Philip II===

[[William Shakespeare]] wrote ''[[The Life and Death of King John]]'' (1596), ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' (1599), ''[[Henry VI, part 1]]'' (1592), ''[[Henry VI, part 2]]'' (1591), and ''[[Henry VI, part 3]]'' (1591),&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, William. Complete works (6th ed). New York: Longman, 2008. http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/&lt;/ref&gt; based on events during the reigns of [[John of England]], king from 1199 to 1216, [[Henry V of England]], king from 1413 to 1422, [[Henry VI of England]], king from 1422 to 1461 and from 1470 to 1471, [[Philip II of France]], king from 1180 to 1223, [[Charles VI of France]], king from 1380 to 1422, and [[Charles VII of France]], king from 1422 to 1461.

In the first scene of ''King John'', [[John of England]] receives a message from [[Philip II of France]], demanding that he abdicate his throne to his nephew, [[Arthur I of Brittany]], believed to be the rightful heir. When John refuses, war is declared. But to obtain a stronger claim to his throne and to appease the French (act 2, scene 1), John agrees to a marriage contract between [[Blanche of Castile]], his niece, and [[Louis the Lion]], Philip's son (1200). In 1203, John captures Arthur, who eventually dies (act 4, scene 3).

As a part of the [[Hundred Years' War]], 1337–1453, the English forces invade France, besieging [[Harfleur]] (1415), act 3, scene 1, and defeat the French at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] (1415). In the final scene, the king marries [[Catherine of Valois]] (1420), daughter to King Charles VI.

===Charles VII===

In act 5 scene 6, Joan of Arc is condemned to be burnt alive, but no mention is made of her trial (1431). In the first scene of ''Henry VI part 2'', King Henry VI of England marries [[Margaret of Anjou]] in 1445, of the [[House of Valois]], niece to King Charles VII, arranged by the marquis of Suffolk, [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk]] as a way to influence the young king through her. In the marriage contract, the English lose the duchy of Anjou and the county of Maine and no dowry is given ([[Treaty of Tours]], 1445). In the final scene, the Yorkists are victorious after the [[First Battle of St Albans]] (1455) during the [[War of the Roses]]. In the first scene of ''Henry VI part 3'', the Yorkists confront the supporters of Henry VI, who discuss whether the king should accept the issue of the duke of York as king. Queen Margaret refuses to accept that her son, Edward, be disinherited. With her principal commander, [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset]], she fights successfully for a while the Yorkists but is eventually defeated by them, whereby the son of [[Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York]], is proclaimed [[King Edward IV of England]] and she sent away to France (1461).

'''Garbology''' is the study of modern refuse and [[Waste|trash]] as well as the use of trash cans, compactors and various types of trash can liners. As an academic discipline it was pioneered at the [[University of Arizona]] and long directed by [[William Rathje]]. The project started in 1973, originating from an idea of two students for a class project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Witold|last= Rybczynski|authorlink= |title=We Are What We Throw Away  |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6DA163CF936A35754C0A964958260&amp;n=Top/Features/Books/Book%20Reviews&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=garbage%20dump%20archaeology&amp;st=cse |quote=Since 1973, a group of anthropologists at the University of Arizona has been conducting a series of systematic archeological digs, minutely sifting, classifying and recording the contents of more than 14 tons of excavated material. The site of their investigation, however, has not been ancient burial grounds or prehistoric settlements, but urban landfills -- in other words, garbage dumps. |work=[[New York Times]] |date=July 5, 1992 |accessdate=2009-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a major source of information on the nature and changing patterns in modern refuse, and thereby, human society.

Industries wishing to demonstrate that discards originating with their products are (or are not) important in the trash stream are avid followers of this research, as are municipalities wishing to learn whether some parts of the trash they collect has any salable value.

The studies of garbology and [[archaeology]] often overlap, because [[fossilization|fossilized]] or otherwise time-modified trash preserved in [[midden]]s is quite often the only remnant of ancient populations that can be found. For those who did not leave [[building]]s, [[writing]], [[tombs]], [[trade]] goods, or [[pottery]], refuse and trash are likely to be the only possible sources of information. In addition, ancient garbage sometimes contains information available in no other way, such as food remains, [[pollen]] traces of then local [[plant]]s, and broken tools.

''Garbology'' is also used as an overtechnical term for [[waste management]], with refuse workers called ''garbologists'', first seen in Australia in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |title=garbology |edition=2nd |year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Scanlan, John A. |title=On garbage |publisher=Reaktion Books |location=London |year=2005 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ramkfpqq9dIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cad=0#PPT197,M1 196] |isbn=1-86189-222-5 |oclc=56652219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===University of Arizona===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2013}}

A. J. Weberman invented the word garbology in 1971 when he went through Bob Dylan's trash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/16/nyregion/the-answers-my-friend-are-written-in-this-book.html|title=The Answers My Friend, Are Written in This Book|first=Colin|last=Moynihan|date=12 November 2017|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Rathje's start of his ecologically oriented garbology [[excavations]] began in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=William |last=Rathje |authorlink= |author2=Cullen Murphy  |title=Archeology of Garbology  |asin=B002KE5U9U}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rathje was hoping to find more information regarding what the landfills contained as well as to examine how garbage reacts in its [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. During the time that Rathje was starting his projects many misconceptions began and the nation became more conscious of what they were throwing away. Many [[United States|Americans]] started thinking the landfills were filled with their "most commonly used items"; fast food containers, disposable diapers, and Styrofoam. Rathje thinks this assumption derives from the fact that these items are often the most colorful and easy to spot. The industrial trash was not correctly accounted for before Rathje's project. According to charts before Rathje the amount of [[building]] material in the land fills was zero.

He started by [[surveying]] different areas of the country to better understand what types of garbage survives under different [[climates]]. He found there was little difference between the sites because the garbage is compacted. The California landfills did have less paper than those in Illinois. [[Recycling]] is thought to be the cause of the paper difference between states. Rathje's research uncovered some other misconceptions about [[landfill]]s. In particular, it was revealed that the rate of natural [[biodegradation]] is far slower than had been assumed (e.g., in capacity planning). It was found that the plastic bottles that were crushed at the top were able to be re-inflated easier than those that were at the bottom because of a new system of bottle making called light-weighting. This is the process of using less plastic in bottles to conserve material and save money. Light-weighting is not limited to plastic alone; this process is used for aluminum and paper as well. Rathje also found that Americans were wrong about what they thought they threw away most. When combined, the three most infamous types of trash—diapers, fast food containers, and Styrofoam—amounted to less than three percent of the landfill's waste. Rathje found that [[plastic]] was 20-24 percent of waste and [[paper]] alone was 40 percent of the waste found in landfills. Thirteen percent of this paper waste was from [[newspapers]]. Rathje states the irony of this fact in his book. He talks about how newspapers are usually the ones that report things such as waste and [[pollution]] and it is these same newspapers clogging the landfills. Rathje discusses the rate of closing landfills and how for every six small landfills closed one large landfill opens. At the time he [[published]] his book he predicted that in the next five years 50 percent of the landfills open at the time would close. He determined this from his findings. In an effort for states to prevent their area becoming a large landfill often states [[ship]] their trash to other states. States such as [[Michigan]] are taking measures to prevent their state from being the landing spot for the nation's trash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecocenter.org/press/releases/20040203.php|title=Press|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michigan has found that in the past years most of their rise in trash rates are because of trash imports from [[Canada]].

===Present-day studies===
Garbology today is used to assess waste and figure out new ideas for waste management. Edward Humes&lt;ref&gt;Humes, E. (2012) Garbology: Our dirty love affair with trash. Avery, 288 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; estimated that the average US citizen produces 93 tons of refuse in his or her lifetime.

Scientists are currently studying the floating mass of plastic trash in the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rd.com/your-america-inspiring-people-and-stories/quick-study-where-our-garbage-goes/article148805.htmlww.cnn.com/2009/TECH/science/08/04/pacific.garbage.patch/&lt;/ref&gt; This affected area is twice the size of Texas. The scientists study the effect of the trash on the [[marine life]], and how to solve the rising problem. Another current study is the process of changing waste into [[energy]]. As both become a rising problem the methane in landfills has the potential to be used to generate small amounts of [[electricity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124233937494621157 | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Climate Change: Garbage Gets Fresh Look as Source of Energy | first=Jeffrey | last=Ball | date=May 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garbology is also what the community of [[Holden Village]] has called its communal sorting, separating, and disposal of landfill, recycling, and compostable items.  Holden Village is a ministry of the Lutheran Church in the Cascade Mountains of Washington and has utilized the term for over a decade.  It reflects both the community's commitment to sustainable practices and a care for creation.  Holden hires a full-time "Garbologist" who leads groups of community members in the sorting of the village waste.

===Green cities===
[[Portland, Oregon]] consistently rates at the top of every list of sustainability, green buildings, recycling rates, clean transportation, energy efficiency, and eco businesses. Portland is considering implementing [[anaerobic digesters]] and [[plasma gasification]] that would efficiently decompose garbage.&lt;ref&gt;Humes, E. (2012) Garbology: Our dirty love affair with trash. Avery, 250 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Copenhagen]], Denmark is the most efficient city in the world with garbage. 3 to 4 percent of the city's waste ends up in landfills. When compared to the 69 percent of the US's average, this is a very small percentage. Trash is largely incinerated and in the process used to generate electricity. Six out of ten Danish homes are heated this way.&lt;ref&gt;Humes, E. (2012) Garbology: Our dirty love affair with trash. Avery, 255 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigative uses===
Another use of garbology is as an investigative [[tool of law enforcement]], [[corporate espionage]], or other types of investigations. This not only includes physical sorting of papers from a rubbish bin but also analysis of files found in a computer's [[recycle bin]]. The FBI ran "trash covers" against various organizations deemed subversive in the early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SAC (Special Agent in Charge ), Washington Field Office)|url=http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/366921-responsive-documents.html#p323|title=FOI Request FBI files on Richard Feynman Requested by Michael Morisy on March 12, 2012 for the Federal Bureau of Investigation of United States of America and fulfilled on March 21, 2012|quote=Through means of a trash cover on the Press Department of the Soviet Embassy [...] on 1/13/55 found a penciled rough draft letter|date=1955-01-26|accessdate=2012-06-08|page=1(323)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Trinity Foundation (Dallas)|Trinity Foundation]] used such measures to demonstrate that the organization of the crooked televangelist [[Robert Tilton]] discarded prayer requests it received after removing the money inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/content/printVersion/288193/|title=The Cult of Ole|first=Glenna|last=Whitley|date=3 August 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries garbology is illegal unless it is being used by the country's intelligence services. However [[journalists]] continue to use it to investigate the stories they produce.

===In the school system===

Garbology has the potential to teach us more sustainable methods when it comes to managing our waste. Our lack of knowledge has resulted in many [[recyclable]] items being thrown out on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Molander|first=Stephanie|author2=Lenihan, Jessica|title=Ways to Waste: The Garbology of Post Consumer Refuse in the UBC Okanagan Cafeteria|date=April 2007|pages=22, 23|url=https://circle.ubc.ca/bitstream/handle/2429/22870/Garbology%20of%20Post-consumer%20Refuse_2.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has negative effects on the environment and the health of the human population. [[Landfills]] continue to be filled up with unnecessary items that are taking up valuable space.&lt;ref name=Newspaper&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Don|title=Landfills filling up with recyclables|url=http://www.yorkregion.com/article/1230265--landfills-filling-up-with-recyclables|accessdate=March 18, 2012|newspaper=York Region|date=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to make a change, it is essential that we learn the necessary facts. In response, many schools have incorporated garbology into the [[curriculum]]. Not only have garbology studies been found in universities, but in primary and secondary schools as well. The general focus has been on the three concepts of [[Reduce, Reuse, Recycle|reduce, reuse, and recycle]].&lt;ref name="Hanna 2003 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanna|first=Arlene|title=Lessons Learned Through Garbology|journal=The Nebline|date=August 2003|volume=16|issue=8|pages=1|url=http://m.today.duke.edu/2011/04/garbology|accessdate=February 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lincoln Public Schools]] have made it a priority to teach their students the importance of garbology while making use of the previous three concepts. They have placed a particular focus on the younger grades, primarily grade two classes. Arlene Hanna, the extension associate and coordinator of enrichment programs in [[Lancaster County, Nebraska|Lancaster County]], states that the "students learn how to identify garbage as natural or manufactured, to describe how garbage impacts the environment and to describe ways to reduce, reuse and recycle." She later reveals that they have seen positive outcomes from parents such as "children checking the codes on plastic bottles at home."&lt;ref name="Hanna 2003 1"/&gt; A large responsibility is put upon younger generations to make a change as they have the strongest potential for creating a better future. The lessons learned in garbology programs are essential in achieving [[sustainability]]. There is nothing more effective than "learning by doing."&lt;ref name="Hanna 2003 1"/&gt;

Metro High School in [[Columbus, Ohio]], is a secondary school which has been recognized for its garbology program. The most unusual aspect of this program is that it is intertwined between all of the student's courses and not just one in particular. Their program uses methods that include videos and graphing which the students then reflect on through assignments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Metro High School|title=What are Metro High School Students Doing About Garbage?|url=http://www.pastfoundation.org/2006Garbology/|publisher=Metro High School|accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Through social media===

Over the years, [[social media]] have become a leading source for information. Garbology Kids, a series of books written by Sabbithry Persad, has created a Facebook group and Twitter account focused on waste management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabbithry|first=Persad|title=Garbology Kids|url=http://garbologykids.com/|publisher=Firewater Media Group|accessdate=March 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The social media sites focus primarily on teaching kids lessons about sustainable waste methods by offering useful sources and activities. Many of the sources offer important information focusing on how to sort garbage, while the activities include crafts which use recycled materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garbology|first=Kids|title=Garbology Kids|url=https://twitter.com/garbologykids|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their main goal is to "offer fun and interesting way[s] to learn about waste generation and waste management for the earth and future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garbology Kids|title=Garbology Kids|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/Garbology-Kids/133920093336919|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=March 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Genopolitics''' is the study of the genetic basis of political behavior and attitudes. It combines [[behavior genetics]], [[psychology]], and [[political science]] and it is closely related to the emerging fields of [[neuropolitics]] (the study of the neural basis of political behavior and attitudes) and political physiology (the study of biophysical correlates of political attitudes and behavior).

In 2008, ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' reported on the increase in academicians' recognition of and engagement in genopolitics as a discrete field of study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Monastersky |first=Richard |date=September 19, 2008 |work=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]] |title=The Body Politic: Biology May Shape Political Views |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Biology-May-Shape-Political/1173}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[New York Times Magazine]]'' included genopolitics in its "Eighth Annual Year in Ideas" for the same year, noting that the term was originally coined by [[James H. Fowler|James Fowler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/magazine/14Ideas-Section2-B-t-007.html |last=Biuso |first=Emily |title=Genopolitics |newspaper=New York Times Magazine |date=December 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of genopolitics have argued that it is "a fundamentally misguided undertaking", and that it is inconsistent with evidence in the fields of [[genetics]], [[neuroscience]], and [[evolutionary psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Charney |first=Evan |last2=English |first2=William |date=May 2013 |title=Genopolitics and the Science of Genetics |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/genopolitics-and-the-science-of-genetics/3743ED789015701CDD2F256F78A91B85 |journal=American Political Science Review |language=en |volume=107 |issue=2 |pages=382–395 |doi=10.1017/S0003055413000099 |issn=0003-0554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twin studies of political attitudes==
Psychologists and behavior geneticists began using twin studies in the 1980s to study variation in social attitudes, and these studies suggested that both genes and environment played a role. In particular, [[Nick Martin (scientist)|Nick Martin]] and his colleagues published an influential [[twin study]] of social attitudes in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'' in 1986.

However, this early work did not specifically analyze whether or not political orientations were heritable, and political scientists remained mostly unaware of the heritability of social attitudes until 2005.  In that year, the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' published a reanalysis of political questions on Martin's social attitude survey of twins in that the suggested liberal and conservative ideology is heritable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/production/action/cjoGetFulltext?fulltextid=307695 |title=Are Political Orientations Genetically Transmitted? |journal=American Political Science Review |volume=99 |pages=153–167 |year=2005 |last=Alford |first=John |author2=Carolyn Funk |author3=John Hibbing  |format=PDF |issue=2 |doi=10.1017/s0003055405051579}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article sparked considerable debate between critics, the authors and their defenders.&lt;ref name=Charney08-1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Charney|first=Evan|title=Genes and Ideologies|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=June 2008|volume=6|issue=2|pages=299–319|doi=10.1017/S1537592708080626|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFH08-1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alford|first=John R.|author2=Funk, Carolyn L. |author3=Hibbing, John R. |title=Beyond Liberals and Conservatives to Political Genotypes and Phenotypes|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=June 2008|volume=6|issue=2|pages=321–328|doi=10.1017/S1537592708080638|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1030&amp;context=poliscifacpub}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hannagan08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hannagan|first=Rebecca J.|author2=Hatemi, Peter K.|title=The Threat of Genes: A Comment on Evan Charney's "Genes and Ideologies"|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=June 2008|volume=6|issue=2|pages=329–335|doi=10.1017/S153759270808064X|url=http://ussc.edu.au/ussc/assets/media/docs/publications/04_Hannagan_Hatemi_PoP_2008.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charney08-2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Charney |first=Evan |date=June 2008 |title=Politics, Genetics, and "Greedy Reductionism" |url=http://www.sanford.duke.edu/research/papers/Perpectives-GeneticsJune2008.pdf#page=37 |journal=Perspectives on Politics |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=337–343 |doi=10.1017/S1537592708080651 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308002322/http://www.sanford.duke.edu/research/papers/Perpectives-GeneticsJune2008.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beckwith08&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beckwith|first=Jon|author2=Morris, Corey A.|title=Twin Studies of Political Behavior: Untenable Assumptions?|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=December 2008|volume=6|issue=4|pages=785–791|doi=10.1017/S1537592708081917|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/morris-singer/files/perspectives_on_politics.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AFH08-2&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alford|first=John R.|author2=Funk, Carolyn L. |author3=Hibbing, John R. |title=Twin Studies, Molecular Genetics, Politics, and Tolerance: A Response to Beckwith and Morris|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=December 2008|volume=6|issue=4|pages=793–797|doi=10.1017/S1537592708081929|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&amp;context=poliscifacpub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twin studies of political behavior==
Initial twin studies suggested that predispositions toward espousal of certain political ideas are heritable, but they said little about political behavior (patterns of voting and/or activism) or predispositions toward it. A 2008 article published in the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'' matched publicly available voter registration records to a [[twin registry]] in Los Angeles, analyzed self-reported [[voter turnout]] in the [[National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health]] (Add Health), and studied other forms of [[political participation]]. In all three cases, both genes and environment contributed significantly to variation in political behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genetic Variation in Political Participation |last=Fowler |first=James H. |author2=Laura A. Baker |author3=Christopher T. Dawes  |journal=American Political Science Review |url=http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/genetic_basis_of_political_cooperation.pdf |issue=2 |volume=102 |pages=233–248 |date=May 2008 |doi=10.1017/S0003055408080209 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional studies showed that genes did not play a direct role in the choice of a political party, supporting a core finding in the study of American politics that the choice to be a Democrat or a Republican is largely shaped by parental socialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Genetics of Voting: An Australian Twin Study |journal=Behavior Genetics |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=435–448 |year=2007 |last=Hatemi |first=Peter K. |pmid=17221311 |author2=Sarah E.

==Gene association studies==

===Candidate genes===
Scholars therefore recently turned their attention to specific genes that might be associated with political behaviors and attitudes. In the first-ever research to link specific genes to political phenotypes, a direct association was established between voter turnout and monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and a gene–environment interaction between turnout and the serotonin transporter (5HTT) gene among those who frequently participated in religious activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Two Genes Predict Voter Turnout |last=Fowler |first=James H. |author2=Christopher T. Dawes |journal=Journal of Politics |date=July 2008 |url= http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/two_genes_predict_voter_turnout.pdf |issue=3 |volume=70 |pages=579–594 |format=PDF |doi=10.1017/S0022381608080638}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other research scholars have also found an association between voter turnout and a dopamine receptor (DRD2) gene that is mediated by a significant association between that gene and the tendency to affiliate with a political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Partisanship, Voting, and the Dopamine D2 Receptor Gene |last=Dawes |first=Christopher T. |author2=James H. Fowler |url=http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/partisanship_voting_and_drd2.pdf | doi = 10.1017/S002238160909094X |year=2008 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=Please state specific conclusion of study, i.e., relationship between specific gene variant and specific ideology.|date=November 2015}} More recent studies show an interaction between friendships and the dopamine receptor (DRD4) gene that is associated with political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Friendships Moderate an Association Between a Dopamine Gene Variant and Political Ideology |last=Settle |first=Jaime E. |author2=Christopher T. Dawes |author3=Peter K. Hatemi |author4=Nicholas A. Christakis |author5=James H. Fowler  |url=http://jhfowler.ucsd.edu/friends_drd4_and_political_ideology.pdf |year=2008 |format=PDF}}{{clarify|reason=Please state specific conclusion of study, i.e., relationship between specific gene variant and specific ideology.|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this work is preliminary and needs replication, it suggests that neurotransmitter function has an important effect on political behavior.

The candidate genes approach to genopolitics received substantial criticism in a 2012 article, published in the ''[[American Political Science Review]]'', which argued that many of the candidate genes identified in the above research are associated with innumerable traits and behaviors. The degree to which these genes are associated with so many outcomes thus undermines the apparent important of evidence linking a gene to any particular outcome.&lt;ref&gt;Charney, Evan, and English, William. (2012). Candidate Genes and Political Behavior. American Political Science Review 106(1):1-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Linkage analysis===
Employing a more general approach, researchers used genome-wide [[Genetic linkage|linkage]] analysis to identify chromosomal regions associated with political attitudes assessed using scores on a liberalism-conservativism scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Genome-Wide Analysis of Liberal and Conservative Political Attitudes|last=Hatemi|first=P. K.|journal=The Journal of Politics|issue=1|volume=73|pages=271–285|url=http://www.vipbg.vcu.edu/~nathan/publications/Hatemi2011.pdf|date=January 2011|doi=10.1017/S0022381610001015|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their analysis identified several significant linkage peaks and the associated chromosomal regions implicate a possible role for NMDA and glutamate related receptors in forming political attitudes. However, this role is speculative as linkage analysis cannot identify the effect of individual genes.

===Other explanations===
Associations between genetic markers and political behavior are often assumed to predict a causal connection between the two. Scholars have little incentive to be skeptical of this presumed causal link. Yet it is possible that a confounding factor exists which makes the genetic relationship with politics purely correlative. For instance work on Irish parties, which shows some evidence of a genetic basis for the otherwise inexplicable distinction between the historically two main parties there, is also and more easily explained by socialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Byrne|first1=Kevin P.|title=Politics with Hidden Bases: Unearthing the Deep Roots of Party Systems|journal=BJPIR|date=2012|volume=14|pages=613–629|doi=10.1111/j.1467-856X.2011.00478.x|url=http://www.kevinbyrne.org/pubs/ByrneOMalley2012.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''German Institute for Economic Research''' ({{lang-de|Deutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung}}) or more commonly '''DIW{{nbsp}}Berlin''' is one of the leading economic research institutes in Germany. It is an independent, non-profit academic institution which is involved in basic research and policy advice. DIW Berlin was founded in 1925 as the Institute for Business Cycle Research and was later renamed.

DIW Berlin presents its research results in science journals, within the scope of national and international scientific events as well as at workshops, symposia and colloquia. The research results provide a basis for the exchange of ideas among experts and other relevant groups. Current economic and structural data, forecasts and advice as well as services in the area of quantitative economics are provided to decision makers in economics and policy and the broad public. DIW Berlin endues a target group specific range of publications, events and data sources. Furthermore, the research results often meet with a major response in the news media.

== Leadership and bodies ==
The legal status of DIW Berlin is that of a registered association. The association's bodies are the Members, the Board of Trustees, the Executive Board and the Scientific Advisory Board. To date, there are 185 employees, 102 of them being researchers.

=== Executive board ===

'''Service departments'''
* Communication
* Information Technology
* Library
* Management Services
* Office Management
* Legal Department and Human Resources

=== Research departments ===
The institute is divided into ten research departments, which are:
 
* The '''Department of Macroeconomics''' focuses on the empirical and theoretical analysis of aggregate economic developments as well  as national and international economic policy.
* The '''Department Forecasting and Economic Policy''' uses modern macroeconomic methods to analyze economic policy issues. Economic forecasting is a key component of the department’s work.
* The Department of '''International Economics''' focuses on monetary and financial issues affecting the global economy. It concentrates on two key activities: examining international financial markets in terms of their economic functionality and analyzing the contribution of financial development to the goal of shared growth in developing and emerging countries.
* The '''Department of Energy, Transportation and Environment''' researches different strategies of sustainable development in energy, transportation and the environment in order to formulate sound policy recommendations.
* The '''Department Climate Policy''' uses empirical and theoretical methods to explore Germany and Europe’s transition to sustainable energy—for example, by analyzing policies related to energy efficiency in buildings as well as the shift to sustainable, climate-friendly power production.
* The '''Department of Competition and Consumers''' aims to produce robust evidence of how society and markets function. Its research combines approaches from industrial economics with behavioral and experimental economics, thus enabling a comprehensive analysis of strategic interactions, market allocations, and human behavior.
* The '''Department of Firms and Markets''' analyzes firms’ strategic behavior and its impact on efficiency, productivity, and growth as well as the institutional and political environment in which firms operate.
* The '''Department of Public Economics''' analyzes how financial, fiscal, and social policies influence economic decisions made by individuals, households, and companies.
* The '''Department of Education and Family''' explores education and family-related issues primarily from a microeconomic perspective. One key question is the extent to which it is possible to fully develop the human potential of a country’s economy.
* The '''Socio-Economic Panel Study''' (SOEP) is a research-based infrastructure facility at DIW Berlin funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and state governments. The SOEP is one of the world's largest and longest-running surveys of individuals and private households. Numerous studies based on SOEP data examine mechanisms behind the distribution of social resources.

== Graduate Center ==
Since 2006 the Graduate Center (GC) of DIW Berlin offers about 15 scholarships per year for PhD positions in economics in cooperation with Berlin's largest universities: [[Free University of Berlin]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], and [[Technical University of Berlin]]. The Graduate Center is located within the DIW building in the center of Berlin. The academic research of students focuses on applied topics. The four-year program is divided into two parts: while students receive academic training in economics and related social sciences during the first year, in years two to four on-the-job training in DIW research projects leads them to complete their doctoral theses. The application period is between January and March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.100305.en/about_us/graduate_center/graduate_center.html Homepage of DIW Graduate Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Co-operations ==
A broad range of predominantly external Research Directors, Research Professors and Research Affiliates research along with the employees of DIW Berlin. They co-operate for a specific time, perform cross sectional tasks, care about scientific surveys (such as diploma thesis, dissertations) and release important pulses for the institute.

== Financing ==
More than half of the Institute's budget is derived from public grants, which DIW Berlin receives as research funding from the State of Berlin and the Federal Government in equal parts. This sum is supplemented by income from projects, research contracts with third parties, trustee memberships and donations.
Because of its financial structure DIW Berlin is member of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community|Leibniz Association]] (WGL).

== Publications ==
Dissemination of information is fundamental to DIW Berlin. As a leading economic research institute, it seeks to supply the wider public with up-to-date economic and structural data, forecasts, research reports, and services in the field of quantitative economics. Research results are presented in the Institute's own publications and in publications edited in co-operation with the Institute.

=== Economic situation forecasts ===
Forecasts about current and future trends in Germany, EU and world economy are published on a regular basis by DIW Berlin.

=== Publications ===
'''Wochenbericht'''

Readily available, condensed information on current economic policy issues. Published weekly in German (Wochenbericht des DIW Berlin).

'''DIW Economic Bulletin'''

The DIW Economic Bulletin is a DIW Berlin online publication. At irregular intervals selected articles of the Wochenbericht are being published online in English..

'''Quarterly Journal of Economic Research'''

Each issue concentrates on a topic relevant to the current economic policy debate. It includes detailed information on research findings and their methodological basis.

'''Discussion papers'''

The papers are presenting pre-publications of research results.

'''DIW Berlin: Policy Advice Compact'''
DIW Berlin furnishes opinions for the Federal Government of Germany, the Commission of the European Union, the Ministries of Federal and State Governments, political parties, interest groups and associations, and the social partners. In the series “DIW Berlin: Policy Advice Compact” these research reports will be published.

'''Applied Economics Quarterly''' (Konjunkturpolitik)

Applied Economics Quarterly is an international journal publishing empirical research on issues with relevance for all areas of economic policy. AEQ is published four times a year in English.

=== Events ===
'''Industrial Conference'''

The Industrial Conference is the traditional institutionalised forum for exchange between the DIW Berlin and the business sector. Since October 1960, the forum has met twice a year - May and November.
Approximately one hundred representatives of enterprises, business associations and economic sciences participate regularly. Since the Federal Government moved to Berlin, the conference has been attracting increasing numbers of participants from politics. The conference understands itself to be a platform for dialogs on different viewpoints and opinions.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

'''Lunchtime Meetings'''

The Berlin Lunchtime Meetings are a joint series of monthly expert talks hosted by the [[Center of Economic Policy Research]] (CEPR), the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin) and the Institute for the Study of Labour (IZA). The seminars serve as a platform for leading European and international researchers to address important policy issues, and as a forum for debate and discussion among researchers, policy makers and the private sector.

== History ==
'''1925''' In July 1925 Ernst Wagemann founds DIW Berlin, which is originally called Institute for Business Cycle Research, and becomes the first President.

'''1928''' In the context of the Quarterly Journal of Economic Research, Arthur Hanau publishes his dissertation „The phenomenon of cyclical development” and becomes head of the agricultural market research in Germany. Using his concept of the „[[Pork cycle|Pork Cycle]]“ is still a popular way of explaining students of economics the relationship between demand and supply.

'''1933–1945''' During the Nazi Regime, Ernst Wagemann is removed from his office. He is questioned several times by the Gestapo and even arrested for a while in 1942. By the end of 1943, the Institute for Business Cycle Research, now renamed in German Institute for Economic Research, is partially relocated to Feldberg, Mecklenburg.

'''1945''' Prof. Dr. Ferdinand Friedensburg takes on being the President of the German Institute for Economic Research until 1968. Now, after the war, the main focus of economic research lies upon economic issues within the city of Berlin.

'''1950''' The first Wochenbericht after the war is published, covering a detailed report about „Germany´ s economic situation at the end of 1945”.

'''1956''' The German Institute for Economic Research moves into its new building in Koenigin-Luise-Straße.

'''1960''' For the first time, the so-called “Grundlinien der Wirtschaftsentwicklung”, forecasts about current and future trends in Germany, EU and world economy, are published. They are referring to the year of 1961.

'''1968''' Dr. Klaus Dieter Arndt becomes new President of the German Institute for Economic Research.

'''1972''' Newly established departments are the Department of Transportation, the Department of Public Finance and the Department of Money and Capital Markets.

'''1975''' Dr. Karl Koenig takes on being new the President of the German Institute for Economic Research.

'''1979''' The German Institute for Economic Research publishes the Wochenbericht „Eine mittelfristige Strategie zur Wiedergewinnung der Vollbeschaeftigung“, proposing strategies for re-establishing full employment in Germany. Taking this report into account, the federal government derives a programme for future investment in year 1977-1980, one of the very few programmes which consequence is a noticeable drop in German unemployment rates. Prof. Dr. [[Hans-Jürgen Krupp]] becomes new President of the German Institute for Economic Research.

'''1989''' The [[Socio-Economic Panel|Socio-Economic Panel Study]] (SOEP) is now part of the German Institute for Economic Research. The main focus of the service institution SOEP is on basic research and scientific services. The Socio-Economic Panel regularly surveys 10,000 private households in a representative longitudinal study. The data acquired is analysed within and outside the German Institute for Economic Research, the results are then used for the analysis of income and labour force developments.

'''1990''' The German Institute for Economic Research clearly disapproves a monetary union with the former GDR. In the case of a monetary union, the only way for the GDR to compensate their difference in productivity would be a significant decrease of the wage level. A unification of wage levels would lead to mass dismissals and enormous business shutdowns. The GDR people would become welfare recipients of the Federal Republic of Germany.

'''1994''' On behalf of [[Greenpeace]], the German Institute for Economic Research analyses the economic consequences of an ecological fiscal reform. The model of [[ecotax]], short for ecological taxation, has been enacted in Germany by means of three laws in the following years.

'''2000''' Prof. Dr. Klaus F. Zimmermann becomes new President of the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin). From now on, there are seven Research Departments. Thus, DIW Berlin is able to react flexible to new respective current economic and social political topics. Main focus of economic research is now lying upon information society and competition, public economics and innovation. The Institute also aims at increasing its number of international cooperations and its participation in research networks worldwide.

'''2003''' DIW Berlin publishes its first Konjunkturprognose (Economic Barometer), an up-to-date indicator of Germany’s economic trends.

'''2006''' With the founding of the DIW Graduate Center, the Institute dedicates itself to furthering the careers of young scientists.

'''2007''' DIW Berlin relocates from Berlin-Dahlem to Mohrenstraße in Berlin-Mitte, marking a return to the city’s government district.

'''2013''' Prof. Marcel Fratzscher becomes new President of the German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.diw.de/sixcms/detail.php?id=diw_01.c.415093.de|title=DIW Berlin: Marcel Fratzscher neuer Präsident des DIW Berlin|last=Berlin|first=DIW|date=2007-03-01|website=www.diw.de|language=de|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2016''' The [http://www.berlin-econ.de/ Berlin Economics Research Associates]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berlin-econ.de/|title=BERA - Berlin Economics Research Associates|last=Berlin|first=DIW|website=www.berlin-econ.de|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (BERA), a postdoctoral program funded by the Leibniz Association to promote the careers of young scientists, is established at DIW Berlin.

'''Gluconasturtiin''' ('''phenethylglucosinolate''') is one of the most widely distributed [[glucosinolate]]s in the [[cruciferous vegetables]], mainly in the roots, and is probably one of the plant compounds responsible for the natural pest-inhibiting properties of growing crucifers, such as cabbage, mustard or rape, in rotation with other crops. This effect of gluconasturtiin is most likely due to its degradation by the plant enzyme [[myrosinase]] into [[phenethyl isothiocyanate]], which is toxic to many organisms.

Gluconasturtiin is named from its occurrence in [[watercress]] (''Nasturtium officinale''). Among the vegetables, it is also found in [[horseradish]] (''Armoracia rusticana'') along with [[sinigrin]]. Both compounds elicit a [[pungent]] taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} RICHARD H. Arômes alimentaires [http://www.cnrs.fr/chimie/communication/images/images-chimietous/minidossiers/cours%20aromes_hubert%20richard.pdf PDF Document] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214074448/http://www.cnrs.fr/chimie/communication/images/images-chimietous/minidossiers/cours%20aromes_hubert%20richard.pdf |date=February 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one investigation of horseradish roots, sinigrin concentration represented 83% and gluconasturtiin 11% of the extracted glucosinolates.&lt;ref&gt; XIAN LI, KUSHAD MM (2004) Correlation of glucosinolate content to myrosinase activity in horseradish (Armoracia rusticana).''

A '''gospel harmony''' is an attempt to compile the [[canonical gospels]] of the [[Christian]] [[New Testament]] into a single account.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; This may take the form either of a single, merged [[narrative]], or a tabular format with one column for each gospel, technically known as a '''synopsis''', although the word ''harmony'' is often used for both.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt;

Harmonies are constructed for a variety of purposes: to provide a straightforward devotional text for parishioners, to create a readable and accessible piece of literature for the general public,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Averitt|first1=Neil|title=The Single Gospel|date=2015|publisher=Wipf and Stock|isbn=978-1-4982-2158-0|pages=xix-xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; to establish a scholarly [[Chronology of Jesus|chronology of events]] in the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|life of Jesus]] as depicted in the canonical gospels, or to better understand how the accounts relate to each other.&lt;ref name=Cox18/&gt;

Among academics, the construction of harmonies has always been favoured by more conservative scholars.{{who?|date=August 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} Students of [[higher criticism]] see the divergences between the gospel accounts as reflecting the construction of traditions by the [[Early centers of Christianity|early Christian communities]].&lt;ref name=Cox1&gt;{{Citation | first = Steven L | last = Cox | year = 2007 | title = Harmony of the Gospels | publisher = B&amp;H | ISBN = 0-8054-9444-8 | pages = 1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Among modern academics, attempts to construct a single story have largely been abandoned in favour of laying out the accounts in [[Parallel passage|parallel columns for comparison]], to allow critical study of the differences between them.&lt;ref name="Christianity, Vol 2005 page 39"&gt;{{Citation | title = The Encyclopedia of Christianity | volume = 4 | publisher = Eerdmans | year = 2005 | page = 39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
A gospel harmony is an attempt to collate the Christian canonical gospels into a single account.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; Harmonies are constructed by some writers in order to make the gospel story available to a wider audience, both religious and secular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Averitt|first1=Neil|title=The Single Gospel|date=2015|publisher=Wipf and Stock|isbn=978-1-4982-2158-0|pages=xix-xx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harmonies can be studied by scholars to establish a coherent chronology of the events depicted in the four canonical gospels in the [[Life of Jesus in the New Testament|life of Jesus]], to better understand how the accounts relate to each other, and to critically evaluate their differences.&lt;ref name=Cox18/&gt;&lt;ref name="Christianity, Vol 2005 page 39"/&gt;

The terms ''harmony'' and ''synopsis'' have been used to refer to several different approaches to consolidating the canonical gospels.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt;  Technically, a "harmony" weaves together sections of scripture into a single narrative, merging the four gospels. There are four main types of harmony: ''radical'', ''synthetic'', ''sequential'' and ''parallel''.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; By contrast, a "synopsis", much like a parallel harmony, justaposes similar texts or accounts in parallel format, synchronized by time, while preserving their individual identity, usually in columns.&lt;ref name=Cox3&gt;Steven L. Cox, 2007 ''Harmony of the Gospels'' B&amp;H Publishing {{ISBN|0-8054-9444-8}} pages 3–4&lt;/ref&gt; Harmonies may also take a visual form and be undertaken to create narratives for artistic purposes, as in the creation of picture compositions depicting the life of Christ.&lt;ref name=corby/&gt;

The oldest approach to harmonizing consists of merging the stories into a single narrative, producing a text longer than any individual gospel.&lt;ref name=Cox18&gt;Steven L. Cox, 2007 ''Harmony of the Gospels'' B&amp;H Publishing {{ISBN|0-8054-9444-8}} page 18&lt;/ref&gt; This creates the most straightforward and detailed account, and one that is likely to be most accessible to non-academic users, such as lay churchgoers or people who are reading the gospels as a work of literature or philosophy.

There are, however, difficulties in the creation of a consolidated narrative. As [[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]] points out, it is impossible to construct a single account from the four gospels without changing at least some parts of the individual accounts.&lt;ref name="John Barton 2013 page 59"&gt;John Barton, ''The Old Testament: Canon Literature and Theology Collected Essays of John Barton'' (Ashgate Publishing, 2013) page 59.&lt;/ref&gt; 

One challenge with any form of harmonizing is that events are sometimes described in a different order in different accounts – the [[Synoptic Gospels]], for instance, describe Jesus overturning tables in the Temple at Jerusalem in the last week of his life, whereas the Gospel of John records a counterpart event only towards the beginning of Jesus's ministry. Harmonists must either choose which time they think is correct, or conclude that separate events are described. Lutheran theologian [[Andreas Osiander]], for instance, proposed in ''Harmonia evangelica'' (1537) that Jesus must have been crowned with thorns twice, and that there were three separate episodes of [[Jesus and the money changers|cleansing of the Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Graham N. Stanton|Graham Stanton]], ''Gospel Truth? New Light on Jesus and the Gospels'' (HarperCollins, 1995) page 8; [[John S. Kloppenborg|John S. Kloppenborg Verbin]], "Is There a New Paradigm?", in Horrell, Tuckett (eds), ''Christology, Controversy, and Community: New Testament Essays in Honour of David R. Catchpole'' (BRILL, 2000), page 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, commentators have long noted that the individual gospels are not written in a rigorously chronological format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Christological  Catechism (quoting Augustine)|last=Fitzmyer|first=Joseph A.|publisher=Paulist Press|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title="Introduction to Matthew," in The Expositor's Bible Commentary vol. VIII|last=Carson|first=D,A.|publisher=Zondervan|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=38-39}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that an event can be described as falling at two different times and still be the same event, so that the substantive details can be properly brought together in a harmony, although the harmonist will still have the task of deciding which of the two times is more probable.

A less common but more serious difficulty arises if the gospels diverge in their substantive description of an event.  An example is the incident involving the centurion whose servant is healed at a distance. In the Gospel of Matthew the centurion comes to Jesus in person;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Matthew|8:8–9|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the Luke version he sends Jewish elders.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Luke|7:6–8|NRSV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since these accounts are clearly describing the same event, the harmonist must decide which is the more accurate description or else devise a composite account.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Allan Powell]], ''Jesus as a Figure in History: How Modern Historians View the Man from Galilee'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1998), page 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Gregg |last=Zegarelli |title=ONE: The Unified Gospel of Jesus |publisher=OUG Press |year=2006|isbn=978-0978990602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern academic view, based on the broadly accepted principle that Matthew and Luke were written using Mark as a source, seeks to explain the differences between the texts in terms of this process of composition. For example, Mark describes John the Baptist as preaching the forgiveness of sins, a detail which is dropped by Matthew, perhaps in the belief that the forgiveness of sins was exclusive to Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Watson (theologian)|Francis Watson]], "Must the Gospels Agree?" in Stuart G. Hall, ''Jesus Christ Today: Studies of Christology in Various Contexts'' (Walter de Gruyter, 2009) page 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern popularizing view, on the other hand, while acknowledging these difficulties, deemphasizes their importance. This view suggests that the divergences in the gospels are a relatively small part of the whole, and that the accounts show a great deal of overall similarity.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; The divergences can therefore be sufficiently discussed in footnote in the course of a consolidated narrative, and need not stand in the way of conveying a better overall view of the life of Jesus&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; or of making this material more accessible to a wider readership.

To illustrate the concept of parallel harmony, a simple example of a "synopsis fragment" is shown here, consisting of just four episodes from the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]].&lt;ref&gt;Steven L. Cox, Kendell H Easley, 2007 ''Harmony of the Gospels'' {{ISBN|0-8054-9444-8}} pages 207–211&lt;/ref&gt; A more comprehensive parallel harmony appears in a section below.

==Early Church and Middle Ages==
[[Image:LondonCanonTables.JPG|upright|thumb|250px|A 6–7th-century use of the [[Eusebian Canons]] to organize the contents of the gospels in the [[London Canon Tables]].]]
[[Tatian]]'s influential ''[[Diatessaron]]'', which dates to about AD 160, was perhaps the very first harmony.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aune190/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Westminster Dictionary of New Testament and Early Christian Literature'' by David Edward Aune (Nov 30, 2003) {{ISBN|0664219179}} pages 127 and 211&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Diatessaron'' reduced the number of verses in the four gospels from 3,780 to 2,769 without missing any event of teaching in the life of Jesus from any of the gospels.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt; Some scholars believe Tatian may have drawn on one or more noncanonical gospels.&lt;ref&gt;Bart Ehrman, Zlatko Plese, ''The Apocryphal Gospels: Texts and Translations'' (Oxford University Press, 2011) page 231.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gospel of the Ebionites]], composed about the same time, is believed to have been a gospel harmony.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Cameron, ''The Other Gospels: Non-canonical Gospel Texts'' (Westminster John Knox Press, 1982) page 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations based on the ''Diatessaron'' continued to appear in the Middle Ages, e.g. Codex Sangallensis (based on the 6th century [[Codex Fuldensis]]) dates to 830 and has a Latin column based on the [[Vulgate]] and an [[Old High German]] column that often resembles the ''Diatessaron'', although errors frequently appear within it.&lt;ref name=RobS28/&gt; The Liege harmony in the [[Limburgish language|Limburg dialect]] (Liege University library item 437) is a key [[Western Church|Western]] source of the ''Diatessaron'' and dates to 1280, although published much later.&lt;ref name=RobS28/&gt;&lt;ref name=Krans188/&gt; The two extant recensions of the Diatessaron in Medieval Italian are the single manuscript Venetian from the 13th or 14th century and the 26 manuscript Tuscan from the 14–15th century.&lt;ref name=RobS28&gt;''Tatian and the Jewish Scriptures'' by Robert F. Shedinger (Jan 1, 2002) {{ISBN|9042910429}} pages 28–32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Krans188&gt;''Patristic and Text-Critical Studies'' by Jan Krans and Joseph Verheyden (Dec 31, 2011) {{ISBN|9004192891}} pages 188–190&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 3rd century [[Ammonius of Alexandria (Christian)|Ammonius of Alexandria]] developed the forerunner of modern synopsis (perhaps based on the ''Diatessaron'') as the [[Ammonian Sections]] in which he started with the text of Matthew and copied along parallel events.&lt;ref name=Cox3/&gt;&lt;ref name=Erwin41&gt;''Encyclopedia Christianity: v. 4'' by Erwin Fahlbusch (1 Jul 2004) {{ISBN|0802824161}} page 41&lt;/ref&gt; There are no extant copies of the harmony of Ammonius and it is only known from a single reference in the letter of [[Eusebius]] to Carpianus.&lt;ref name=Erwin41/&gt; In the letter Eusebius also discusses his own approach, i.e. the [[Eusebian Canons]] in which the texts of the gospels are shown in parallel to help comparison among the four gospels.&lt;ref name=Erwin41/&gt;

In the 5th century, [[Augustine of Hippo]] wrote extensively on the subject in his book ''[[Harmony of the Gospels (Augustine)|Harmony of the Gospels]]''.&lt;ref name=Lancel &gt;''Augustine through the ages: an encyclopedia'' by John C. Cavadini 1999 {{ISBN|0-8028-3843-X}} page 132&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine viewed the variations in the gospel accounts in terms of the different focuses of the authors on Jesus: Matthew on royalty, Mark on humanity, Luke on priesthood and John on divinity.&lt;ref name=Tuckett38 &gt;''Christology, Controversy and Community'' by David G. Horell and Christopher M. Tuckett (8 Aug 2000) {{ISBN|9004116796}} pages 37–40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clement of Llanthony]]'s ''[[Unum ex Quatuor]]'' (''One from Four'') was considered an improvement on previous canons at the time,{{sfnp|Smalley|1981|p=250}} although modern scholars sometimes opine that no major advances beyond Augustine emerged on the topic until the 15th century.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt; Throughout the [[Middle Ages]] harmonies based on the principles of the ''Diatessaron'' continued to appear, e.g. the Liege harmony by Plooij in [[Middle Dutch]], and the Pepysian harmony in [[Middle English]].&lt;ref name=Krans188/&gt;&lt;ref name=Erwin41/&gt; The Pepysian harmony (Magdalene college, Cambridge, item Pepys 2498) dates to about 1400 and its name derives from having been owned by [[Samuel Pepys]].&lt;ref name=Krans188/&gt;

==15th–20th centuries==
[[File:Branteghem Gospel harmony Antwerp 1537.JPG|upright|thumb|250px|The cover of Branteghem's 1537 visual gospel harmony, [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref name=Celeste2/&gt;]]
In the 15th and the 16th centuries some new approaches to harmony began to appear, e.g. [[Jean Gerson]] produced a harmony which gave priority to the [[Gospel of John]].&lt;ref name=Erwin41/&gt;. [[Cornelius Jansen (Bishop of Ghent)]] also published his harmony (1549), focusing on the four gospels and even referring to the Acts of the Apostles.&lt;ref&gt;François, W. (2012). Augustine and the Golden Age of Biblical Scholarship in Louvain (1550-1650). In: Gordon B., McLean M. (Eds.), bookseries: Library of the Written Word, vol: 20, Shaping the Bible in the Reformation: Books, Scholars and Their Readers in the Sixteenth Century. Leiden: Brill, 235-289, on  252.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand [[John Calvin]]'s approach focused on the three synoptic Gospels, and excluded the Gospel of John.
&lt;ref&gt;''John Calvin And the Printed Book'' by Jean François Gilmont (Nov 30, 2005) {{ISBN|1931112568}} page 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Harmony of the Gospels: Matthew, Mark, and Luke'' by John Calvin, David W. Torrance,(Jul 17, 1995) {{ISBN|0802808026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By this time visual representations had also started appearing, for instance, the 15th-century artist [[Lieven de Witte]] produced a set of about 200 woodcut images that depicted the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' in terms of a "pictorial gospel harmony" which then appeared in Willem van Branteghem's harmony published in [[Antwerp]] in 1537.&lt;ref name=corby&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=C8vYRVoqzf4C&amp;pg=PA398#v=snippet&amp;q=gospel%20harmony&amp;f=false Seeing Beyond the Word: Visual Arts and the Calvinist Tradition]'' by Paul Corby Finney 1999 {{ISBN|080283860X}} page 398&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Celeste2/&gt; The importance of imagery is reflected in the title of Branteghem's well known work: ''The Life of Jesus Christ Skillfully Portrayed in Elegant Pictures Drawn from the Narratives of the Four Evangelists''&lt;ref name=Celeste2&gt;''The Authority of the Word: Reflecting on Image and Text in Northern Europe, 1400–1700'' by Celeste Brusati, Karl A. E. Enenkel and Walter S. Melion (Nov 2011) {{ISBN|9004215158}} pages 2–6&lt;/ref&gt;

The 16th century witnessed a major increase in the introduction of gospel harmonies. In this period the ''parallel column structure'' became widespread, partly in response to the rise of [[biblical criticism]].&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt; This new format was used to emphasize the trustworthiness of the gospels. It is not clear who produced the very first parallel harmony, but [[Gerhard Mercator]]'s 1569 system is a well-known example.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sandy35&gt;''What Have They Done to the Bible?: A History of Modern Biblical Interpretation'' by John Sandys-Wunsch (20 Aug 2005) {{ISBN|0814650287}} page 35&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of content and quality, [[Johann Jacob Griesbach]]'s 1776 synopsis was a notable case.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sandy35/&gt;

At the same time, the rise of modern biblical criticism was instrumental in the decline of the traditional apologetic gospel harmony. The Enlightenment writer, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], observed:

{{quote|Oh that most excellent Harmony, which can only reconcile two contradictory reports, both stemming from the evangelists, by inventing a third report, not a syllable of which is to be found in any individual evangelist!&lt;ref&gt;Gotthold Ephraim Lessing Werke, 8.51-52, cited in [[Francis Watson (theologian)|Francis Watson]], ''Gospel Writing: A Canonical Perspective'' (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2013), page 80.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

W. G. Rushbrooke's 1880 ''Synopticon'' is at times considered a turning point in the history of the synopsis, as it was based on [[Markan priority]], i.e. the assumption that the Gospel of Mark was the first to be written.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt; Thirteen years later, [[John Broadus]] used historical accounts to assign priorities in his harmony, while previous approaches had used feasts as the major milestones for dividing the life of Christ.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt;

Towards the end of the 19th century, after extensive travels and study in the Middle East, [[James Tissot]] produced a set of [[commons:Life of Jesus|350 watercolors which depicted]] the [[Life of Christ in art|life of Christ]] as a visual gospel harmony.&lt;ref name=Dolkart70/&gt; Tissot synthesized the four gospels into a singular narrative with five chapters: "the Holy Childhood, the Ministry, Holy Week, the Passion, and the Resurrection". He also made portraits of each of the [[four evangelists]] to honor them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/brooklynmuseum-o4548-saint-luke-saint-luc |title=James Tissot: Saint Luke (Saint Luc) (1886) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Brooklyn Museum |format= |accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the ''Synopsis of the Four Gospels'' by [[Kurt Aland]]&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Aland, 1982 ''Synopsis of the Four Gospels'' United Bible Societies {{ISBN|0-8267-0500-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; came to be seen by some as "perhaps the standard for an in-depth study of the Gospels."&lt;ref name=Cox6&gt;Steven L. Cox, Kendell H Easley, 2007 ''Harmony of the Gospels'' {{ISBN|0-8054-9444-8}} pages 6–8&lt;/ref&gt; A key feature of Aland's work is the incorporation of the full text of the Gospel of John.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt; [[John Bernard Orchard]]'s synopsis (which has the same title)&lt;ref&gt;John Bernard Orchard, 1983 ''Synopsis of the Four Gospels'' T&amp;T Clark Publishers {{ISBN|0-567-09331-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; was of note in that it took the unusual approach of abandoning [[Markan priority]] and assuming the synopics were written in this order: Matthew, Luke, Mark.&lt;ref name=Cox6/&gt;

The following table is an example of a parallel harmony, based on the [[list of key episodes in the Canonical Gospels]]. The order of events, especially during the ministry period, has been the subject of speculation and scholarly debate. While this harmony compares the work of several scholars, other harmonies may differ substantially on the placement of some events. The episode structure within the table is based on Edward Robinson's ''A Harmony of the Gospels in Greek''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=William Newcome |editor=Edward Robinson |title=A harmony of the Gospels in Greek, in the general order of Le Clere &amp; Newcome, with Newcome's notes: Printed from the text and with the various readings of Knapp |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_harmony_of_the_Gospels_in_Greek_in_the.html?id=04bNAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Gould and Newman |year=1834}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8435">'''Günter Ropohl''' (14 June 1939 in [[Cologne]], Germany – 28 January 2017) was a German philosopher of technology.

== Biography ==
Günter Ropohl studied [[mechanical engineering]] and philosophy at [[Stuttgart]] University, where he was a scholar of the philosopher [[Max Bense]]. After his PhD ([[Dr.-Ing.]]) in 1970, he wrote his [[Habilitation]] thesis in Philosophy und Sociology at [[Karlsruhe University]] 1978 under the supervision of [[Hans Lenk (philosopher)|Hans Lenk]]. His work dealt with the [[systems theory]] of "[[Technik]]" (engl. ''technique''), leading to the concept of [[general technology]].&lt;ref&gt;published under the title ''Eine Systemtheorie der Technik'' 1979, 2nd. ed. under the title ''Allgemeine Technologie'', 1999, 3rd ed. 2009, open source: [http://digbib.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/volltexte/1000011529]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1979, Ropohl became Professor at the [[Universität Karlsruhe (TH)]]. Soon after, in 1981, he became Professor for [[Allgemeine Technologie]] (general technology) and [[philosophy of technology]] at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]], Germany (until 2004). In the 1980s, he visited his colleague and friend [[Carl Mitcham]] in the United States. From 1983 to 1991, i.e. during the period of the [[Cold War]], he was course director and visiting lecturer at the Inter-University Centre Dubrovnik ([[Croatia]]). In 1988, he was invited as visiting professor at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]], Rochester NY.
Ropohl was an honorary member of the German Engineering Association ([[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI]]), due to his interdisciplinary engagement for the philosophy of technology. He was co-editor of an anthology of the ''classics'' in the philosophy of technology in a Continental-European tradition.&lt;ref&gt;* Hubig, Ch., Huning, A. and Ropohl, G. (Eds.), ''Nachdenken über Technik. Die Klassiker der Technikphilosophie'', Berlin 2000. 3rd ed. 2013 (to be translated into English and Chinese in the next years).&lt;/ref&gt; Ropohl published 15 monographs, (co-)edited another 15 books and published more than 180 articles. He died on 28 January 2017 at the age of 77.&lt;ref&gt;[http://netzwerk-rauchen.de/component/content/article/1-aktuelle-nachrichten/975-guenter-ropohl-verstorben.html Günter Ropohl verstorben] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

A central concept in his work was [[sociotechnical systems]], i.e. he regarded techniques as societal structures. Ropohl was a critic of the systems theory of [[Niklas Luhmann]] and voted for the recognition of [[material culture]]. His definition of (''German'') "Technik" included a) the [[utility]], b) artificiality and c) [[Function (engineering)|functionality]]. In the focus of his work is the combination of technique as [[Document|artefact]] and [[Action theory (philosophy)|action]], whereas [[knowledge]] insinuates the meta-concept of [[technology]]. Therefore, he differentiated between [[engineering sciences]] and [[technical sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Günter Ropohl, ''Eine Systemtheorie der Technik'', 1979, p. 34f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ropohl was well known in the German-speaking academia for his writings on the concepts of ''Technik'' and ''Technologie'', the [[ethics of technology]], [[technology assessment]], professional ethics for engineers and on the societal need for educating towards technology literacy.

He received a [[Festschrift]] with contributions from academic scholars, focusing on his work and related discourses, both on his 65th and 75th birthday (edited by [[Nicole C. Karafyllis]], see literature), including a complete list of his publications from the late 1960s to 2014.

Since reports of the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) began to emerge in the [[United States]] in the 1980s, the HIV epidemic has frequently been linked to [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and other [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM) by epidemiologists and medical professionals. The first official report on the virus was published by the [[Center for Disease Control]] (CDC) on June 5, 1981 and detailed the cases of five young gay men who were hospitalised with serious infections.&lt;ref&gt;CDC (1981, 5th June) 'Pheumocystis Pneumonia - Los Angeles', MMWR, Vol. 30.                        No. 21. https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/june_5.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, The New York Times reported that 41 homosexuals had been diagnosed with [[Kaposi’s Sarcoma]], and eight had died less than 24 months after the diagnosis was made.&lt;ref&gt;The New York Times (1981, 3rd July) "Rare cancer seen in 41 homosexuals" https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/03/us/rare-cancer-seen-in-41-homosexuals.html?&amp;pagewanted=2&lt;/ref&gt; By 1982, the condition was referred to in the medical community as ([[Gay-related immune deficiency]] (GRID), "gay cancer," and "gay compromise syndrome."&lt;ref&gt;Oswald, G.A, et al (1982) 'Attempted immune stimulation in the "gay compromise syndrome"'. BMJ, 1982 October 16; 285(6348): 1082.&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until July 1982 that the term [[Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome]] (AIDS) was suggested to replace GRID,&lt;ref&gt;Grmek, M.D. (1990) 'History of AIDS: Emergence and origin of a modern pandemic', New Jersey: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and even then it was not until September that the CDC first used the AIDS acronym in an official report.&lt;ref&gt;MMWR Weekly (1982) 'Current Trends Update on Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) – United States', September 24, 31(37); 507-508, 513-514.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now well understood that HIV does not only affect the [[gay community]] but can also infect anybody, regardless of sex, ethnicity, or [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="UNAIDS"&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 AIDS epidemic update |publisher=Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and World Health Organization |date=November 2009 |url=http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/epidemiology/2009aidsepidemicupdate |accessdate=September 28, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928011837/http://www.unaids.org/en/dataanalysis/epidemiology/2009aidsepidemicupdate/ |archivedate=September 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, HIV still severely affects MSM across the globe.  MSM are only a small percentage of the U.S. population, but they are consistently the population group most affected by the HIV/AIDS virus and are the largest proportion of American citizens with an AIDS diagnosis who have died.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"&gt;Center for Disease Control. “HIV among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM)” (2010). Department of Health and Human Services.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations estimates that 2 to 20% of MSM are infected with HIV, depending on the region they live in.&lt;ref name="data.unaids.org"&gt;Men who have sex with men, HIV prevention and care” Geneva, November 2005. UNAIDS. http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2006/jc1233-msm-meetingreport_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Men who have sex with men}}
Men who have sex with men (abbreviated as '''MSM''', also known as '''males who have sex with males''') are [[male|male person]]s who engage in sexual activity with members of the same sex, regardless of how they personally identify themselves. Many MSM choose not to (or cannot for other reasons) identify as [[homosexual]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNAIDS: Men who have sex with men |publisher=UNAIDS |url=http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/briefingnote/2006/20060801_policy_brief_msm_en.pdf |accessdate=October 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320001221/http://www.unaids.org/en/media/unaids/contentassets/dataimport/pub/briefingnote/2006/20060801_policy_brief_msm_en.pdf |archivedate=March 20, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the label excludes men who identify as gay or bisexual, but who have never had sex with another man, including many gay teenagers.

The terms MSM and women who have sex with women (WSW) have been used in medical scholarship since at least 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Rebecca M. and Ilan H. Meyer. “The Trouble With “MSM” and "WSW”: Erasure of the Sexual-Minority Person in Public Health Discourse.” Am J Public Health. (2005) 95: 1144–1149.&lt;/ref&gt; But, the term has been attributed to Glick ''et al.'', because their usage in a 1994 study solidified the concept in medical terminology.&lt;ref name="Young Meyer"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Young RM, Meyer IH |title=The trouble with "MSM" and "WSW": erasure of the sexual-minority person in public health discourse |journal=Am J Public Health |volume=95 |issue=7 |pages=1144–1149 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15961753 |pmc=1449332 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2004.046714 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Glick M, Muzyka BC, Salkin LM, Lurie D |title=Necrotizing ulcerative periodontitis: a marker for immune deterioration and a predictor for the diagnosis of AIDS |journal=J.

===Demographics===
Determining the number of men who have ever had sex with another man is difficult worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that at least 3% and as high as 16% of men have had sex at least once with a man. Their estimate includes victims of sexual abuse in addition to men who regularly or voluntarily have sex with men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

UNAIDS. http://data.unaids.org/pub/Report/2006/jc1233-msm-meetingreport_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates about the U.S. population of MSM vary. The Center for Disease Control estimates that men who have sex with men represent about 2% of the American population.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"/&gt; A 2005 study estimates that among U.S. men aged 15 to 44, an estimated 6% of have engaged in oral or anal sex with another man at some point in their lives, and about 2.9% have had at least one male partner in the previous 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Of these men, 71% are White, 15.9% are Hispanic, and 8.9% are black. The percentage of men who were MSM varied by state, with the lowest percentage in South Dakota (3.3%) and the highest in the District of Columbia (13.2%).  However, the same study found that 57% of men who have sex with men identify as bisexual or straight.&lt;ref&gt;Lieb, S., Fallon, S., Friedman, S., Thompson, D., Gates, G., Liberti, T., &amp; Malow, R.

==HIV infection rates==

The HIV virus affects the human [[immune system]] and, if left untreated can eventually lead to [[Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome]] (AIDS).&lt;ref name="pmid11396444"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sepkowitz KA |title=AIDS—the first 20 years |journal=N.

The CDC reported  that in 2009 that male-to-male sex (MSM)  accounted for 61% of all new HIV infections in the U.S. and that those who had a history of recreational [[drug injection]] accounted for an additional 3% of new infections. Among the approximately 784,701 people living with an HIV diagnosis, 396,810 (51%) were MSM. About 48% of MSM living with an HIV diagnosis were white, 30% were black, and 19% were Hispanic or Latino. Although the majority of MSM are white,  non-whites accounted for 54% of new infections HIV related MSM infections in 2008.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"/&gt;

In 2010  the CDC reported that MSM represented approximately 4 percent of the male population in the United States but male-to-male sex accounted for 78 percent  of new HIV infections among men and 63 percent of all new infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DECEMBER 2012 2 HIV Infections by Route  of Transmission|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/docs/2012/hiv-infections-2007-2010.pdf|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men overall accounted for 76% of all adults and adolescents living with HIV infection at the end of 2010 in the United States, and 80% (38,000) of the estimated 47,500 new HIV infections.  69% of men  living with HIV were gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men.  39% (14,700) of new HIV infections in US men were in blacks, 35% (13,200) were in whites, and 22% (8,500) were in Hispanics/Latinos.  The rate of estimated new HIV infections among black men (per 100,000) was 103.6—six and a half times that of white men (15.8) and more than twice the rate among Hispanic/Latino men (45.5) as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV Among Men in the United States|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/men/index.html|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CDC (2015) reported  that gay and bisexual men accounted for 82% (26,375 out of 1,242,000 adults and adolescents) of HIV diagnoses among males and 67% of all diagnoses in the United States, while six percent (2,392) of HIV diagnoses were attributed to injection drug use (IDU) and another 3% (1,202) to male-to-male sexual contact plus IDU.  Heterosexual contact accounted for 24% (9,339) of all HIV diagnoses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV in the United States: At A Glance|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/overview/ataglance.html|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among all gay and bisexual men with HIV infection classified as AIDS in the United States in 2015, African Americans accounted for the highest number (3,928; 39%), followed by whites (3,096; 31%) and Hispanics/Latinos (2,430; 24%). At the end of 2014, 508,676 gay and bisexual men were living with diagnosed HIV infection (53% of everyone living with diagnosed HIV in the US). Of gay and bisexual men living with diagnosed HIV, 157,758 (31%) were African American, 212,558 (42%) were white, and 109,857 (22%) were Hispanic/Latino. From 2005 to 2014 diagnoses among African American gay and bisexual men increased 22% but has increased less than 1% between 2010 and 2014. HIV diagnoses among African American gay and bisexual men aged 13 to 24 increased 87% between 2005 and 2014, but with diagnoses declining 2% between 2010 and 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HIV Among African American Gay and Bisexual Men|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/msm/bmsm.html|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A 2010 study estimated that for every 100,000 MSM, 692 will be diagnosed with HIV. This makes MSM 60 times more likely to contract the virus than other men and 54 times more likely than women.&lt;ref&gt;Purcell, D.W., C Johnson, A Lansky, J Prejean, R Stein, P Denning, Z Gaul, H Weinstock, J Su, &amp; N Crepaz.

Since its height in 1993-1994 the death rate due to HIV  has fallen more than 9 other leading causes of death, yet as of 2013 HIV continues to be one of the 10  leading causes of death among persons 25-44, especially among men, African Americans and in the South.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mortality Slide Series|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pdf/library/slidesets/cdc-hiv-epa5-mortality-slides-2013.pdf|website=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|publisher=U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also as regards HIV relation to mortality, a study  in the [[United Kingdom]]   reported that in 2008 the overall mortality rate among the HIV-diagnosed  population aged 15–59 years remained more than five times higher than that in the general population. However, as the study acknowledges  data  on  the  impact  of  HIV/AIDS  on  mortality among  gay and bisexual men as well as  among other populations, is very limited, and  methods to use  this are  problematic.&lt;ref name="wiley.com"&gt;Wiley Online Library: [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/hiv.12045/pdf Ten-year mortality trends among persons diagnosed with HIV infection in England and Wales in the era of antiretroviral therapy: AIDS remains a silent killer - Simmons - 2013 - HIV Medicine - Wiley Online Library], accessdate: April 2, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors==
A 2007 study analyzing two large population surveys found that "the majority of gay men had similar numbers of unprotected sexual partners annually as straight men and women."&lt;ref name=MedicalNews&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/82330.php Sexual Behavior Does Not Explain Varying HIV Rates Among Gay And Straight Men]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goodreau SM, Golden MR |title=Biological and demographic causes of high HIV and sexually transmitted disease prevalence in men who have sex with men |journal=Sex Transm Infect |volume=83 |issue=6 |pages=458–462 |date=October 2007 |pmid=17855487 |pmc=2598698 |doi=10.1136/sti.2007.025627}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2006 study found that men who reported 4 or more male sexual partners were at increased risk of HIV infection. Study participants who reported amphetamine or heavy alcohol use before sex were more likely to have HIV or other sexually transmitted infections.&lt;ref name="BA Koblin. 2006"&gt;BA Koblin. “Risk factors for HIV infection among men who have sex with men” (2006) AIDS, 20. 731-739.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Kaiser Family Foundation study indicated that fewer Americans view HIV as a top health priority today compared to ten years ago. In 1996, 25% of Americans viewed HIV as an “urgent problem” to their community but in 2009, only 17% listed it as “urgent.” The percentage of 18- to 29-year-olds that were personally concerned about contracting the virus dropped from 28% in 1995 to 17% in 2009 &lt;ref&gt;Kaiser Family Foundation. (2009) “2009 Survey of Americans on HIV/AIDS: summary of findings on the domestic epidemic.”&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in 6 major U.S. cities found that only one in 4 teenage men who have sex with men believed they were personally at risk for contracting the HIV virus.&lt;ref&gt;MacKellar DA, Valleroy LA, Secura GM, et al. (2007) Perceptions of lifetime risk and actual risk for acquiring HIV among young men who have sex with men. AIDS Behav:263-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unprotected anal intercourse===

The HIV virus is more easily transmitted through unprotected [[anal intercourse]] than through unprotected [[vaginal intercourse]] &lt;ref&gt;http://www.avert.org/men-sex-men.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and men who report unprotected receptive anal intercourse are at increased risk of contracting the HIV virus.&lt;ref name="BA Koblin. 2006"/&gt; Generally, the receptive partner is at greater risk of contracting the HIV virus because the lining of the rectum is thin and may allow the virus to enter the body through semen exchange. The insertive partner is also at risk because STIs can enter through the [[urethra]] or through small cuts, abrasions, or open sores on the penis. Also, condoms are more likely to break during anal sex than during vaginal sex. Thus, even with a condom, anal sex can be risky.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/resources/qa/qa22.htm Center for Disease Control; "Can I get HIV from anal sex?"]&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 study of HIV positive men found men who had unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) in the past year were put at risk for contracting the virus. The study found that men who reported engaging in UAI had increased from 30% in 1996 to 42% in 2000. Almost half of all men who participated in UAI in 1996-1997 said that they had not known the HIV status of their partner &lt;ref&gt;Dodds, J.P., D.E. Mercey, J.V. Parry &amp; A.M. Johnson. (2004) Increasing risk behaviour and high levels of undiagnosed HIV infection in a community sample of homosexual men. Sex Transm Infect; 80:236-240&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that risk factors for HIV infection are anal intercourse with a man in the past 12 months, having unstable housing, and having inhaled [[alkyl nitrites]] (“poppers”).&lt;ref&gt;Mimiaga, M., Reisner, S., Cranston, K., Isenberg, D., Bright, D., Daffin, G., Bland, S., &amp; Driscoll, M. (2009). Sexual mixing patterns and partner characteristics of black msm in Massachusetts at increased risk for HIV infection and transmission. Journal of Urban Health, 86(4), 602-623.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study on the prevalence of unprotected anal intercourse among HIV-diagnosed MSM found that majority protected their partners during sexual activity, but a sizeable number of men continue to engage in sexual behaviors that place themselves and others at risk for HIV infections.&lt;ref&gt;Crepaz, Nicole, Marks, Gary; Liau, Adrian; Mullins, Mary M; Aupont, Latrina W; Marshall, Khiya J; Jacobs, Elizabeth D; Wolitski, Richard J; (2009) “Prevalence of unprotected anal intercourse among HIV-diagnosed MSM in the United States: a meta-analysis”, AIDS, 80, 23:1617-1629&lt;/ref&gt;

===Condom fatigue===
Although HIV transmission rates fell throughout the 1990s, they hit a plateau at the end of the decade. The increasing rates of sexually transmitted diseases in major cities in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom led to reports in the gay and mainstream media of [[condom fatigue]] and "AIDS optimism" as causes of the new "laxness" in safe sex practices.&lt;ref name="Adam, Barry D. 2005"&gt;Adam, Barry D., Winston Husbands, James Murray, and John Maxwell. (2005): AIDS optimism, condom fatigue, or self-esteem? Explaining unsafe sex among gay and bisexual men, Journal of Sex Research, 42:3, 238-248&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by research on the tendency of couples (heterosexual or homosexual) to use [[condoms]] less over time.&lt;ref&gt;Appleby, P., Miller, L., &amp; Rothspan, S. (1999). The paradox of trust for male couples. Personal Relationships, 6, 81-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bochow, M. (1998). The importance of contextualizing research. In M. Wright, B. R. S.

Interpretations of condom use and nonuse among young Norwegian gay men. Medical Anthropology Quarterly, 15(1), 58-83.&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2010 study found that gay and bisexual men choose to have unprotected sex for a variety of reasons and cannot be generalized. [[Erectile dysfunction]], mental health problems and [[Mood disorder|depression]], lack of communication or intimacy, and a [[subculture]] of unprotected sex were all listed as reasons why men had sex without condoms voluntarily.&lt;ref name="Adam, Barry D. 2005"/&gt;

==Prevention==
In the late 1980s the first direct advocacy groups for people with HIV/AIDS were created. Notably, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power ([[ACT UP]]) formed at the [[Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual &amp; Transgender Community Center]] in New York in the wake of the antiretroviral drug [[Zidovudine|AZT]] to petition better access to drugs as well as cheaper prices, public education about AIDS and the prohibition of AIDS-related discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;ACT UP New York: Capsule History - 1988, [http://www.actupny.org/documents/cron-88.html Actupny.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) published a paper in 2005 offering specific policy solutions for alleviating the spread of the HIV virus in the MSM population for specific regions around the world. They pointed to “a profound lack of knowledge” and stigma about sexual identity as worldwide barriers to preventing transmission and encouraging those infected to seek treatment. The UNAIDS program has recommended that the South African government implement “sex positive” policies to reduce societal stigma around homosexuality and promote the use of water-based lubricants. Particularly in Morocco, the program has advocated distributing condoms in prisons. In recent years, the Chinese government has begun to acknowledge the sexuality of its constituents. According to UNAIDS, the “Government has made significant progress in recognizing the issue of male-to-male sexual health and HIV.” In Latin America, outreach to rural areas is critical to ensuring care to all individuals. The United Nations also emphasizes a focus on LGBT populations that are most vulnerable in Latin American nations. In Jamaica, as in many countries across the globe, homosexuality is outlawed so there are unique challenges to HIV prevention in the MSM community. The UN is trying to implement community-based strategies in Jamaica while still ensuring the anonymity of the people served. In Norway, UNAIDS has observed an increasing number of MSM who have untreated sexually transmitted infections, and their emphasis is on promoting condom use within the gay community. Despite Canada’s “liberal and progressive” reputation on the world stage, HIV-related stigma is still related to the gay community. The United Nations believes the United States needs to recognize [[sexual education]] as a fundamental human right. Additionally, better research on MSM in the U.S. would positively affect funding for HIV prevention and treatment programs.&lt;ref name="Geneva 2005"/&gt;

Studies have shown that although there is a large market for vaginal microbicides in developing nations, rectal microbicides are stigmatized and less researched. No microbicide has yet been proven to effectively protect against the risks of unprotected anal intercourses, but advocates believe greater funding for research is needed since condom usage rates are so low. However, stigma and homophobia would potentially be barriers to individuals buying the product. The authors mention this is especially a concern in Caribbean countries where HIV prevalence is high but homosexuality is still illegal and highly stigmatized (See [[HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean]].) &lt;ref&gt;

===Access to testing===
UNAIDS has observed “sero-selection” (choosing a partner based on their HIV status) becoming increasingly prevalent in partner choice and transmission in the United States.&lt;ref name="data.unaids.org"/&gt; A 2008 CDC study found that one in five (19%) of MSM in major U.S. cities were infected with HIV and almost half (44%) were unaware of their infection.&lt;ref name="Disease Control 2010"/&gt; Many HIV-infected individuals do not seek treatment until late in their infection (an estimated 42% do not seek treatment until they begin to experience signs of illness.) Furthermore, a significant portion of individuals who are tested for HIV never return for their test results. Studies have advocated for funding and implementation of HIV tests that can be administered outside medical settings since 2003. Home testing is considered especially important because 8%-39% of partners tested in studies of partner counseling and referral services (PCRS) were found to have a previously undiagnosed HIV infection that their partner was unaware of.&lt;ref&gt;R. S. Janssen, M.D., I. M. Onorato, M.D., R. O. Valdiserri, M.D., T. M. Durham, M.S., W. P. Nichols, M.P.A., E. M. Seiler, M.P.A., H. W. Jaffe, M.D. “Advancing HIV Prevention: New Strategies for a Changing Epidemic -- United States, 2003” (2003) The Body Pro: HIV Resource for Health Professionals.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, OraQuick, the first rapid HIV home-testing kit, went on sale for $40. The test is nearly 100% accurate when it predicts HIV-negative results for HIV-negative individuals. However, for HIV-positive individuals that are not yet producing the antibodies detected by the test, it produces a false negative 93% of the time. Although the manufacturer, OraSure Technologies, is not advertising the test for use for selection of partners,  experts have suggested that it may prevent unprotected sexual contact with partners that lie about or are unaware of their HIV status.&lt;ref name="Donald G. 2012"&gt;McNeil Jr., Donald G. “Another Use for Rapid Home H.I.V. Test: Screening Sexual Partners.” The New York Times. October 5th, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent study examined how the OraQuick test would identify the behavior of 27 self-identified gay men who frequently had unprotected sex with acquaintances. The researchers gave each participant 16 tests to use over the course of three months. 101 potential partners were tested, and 10 were positive. None of the participants had sex with someone who tested positive.  23 other potential partners refused testing and left the encounter. 2 men admitted they were HIV-positive. Most participants said they would continue using home tests after the study ended to test potential partners on their own. The researchers considered home testing to be an effective prevention method for high-risk groups.&lt;ref&gt;Carballo-Dieguez, Alex, Timothy Frasca, Ivan Balan, Mobolaji Ibitoye, and Curtis Dolezal. “Use of a Rapid HIV Home Test Prevents HIV Exposure in a High Risk Sample of Men Who Have Sex With Men.” AIDS and Behavior. Volume 16, Number 7 (2012), 1753-1760.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the test’s $40 cost is considered a major deterrent to commonplace partner testing.

'''Health geography''' is the application of geographical information, perspectives, and methods to the study of [[health]], [[disease]], and [[health care]].

== Overview ==

The study of health geography has been influenced by repositioning medical geography within the field of [[social geography]] due to a shift towards a social model in health care, rather than a medical model&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Rethinking the health consequences of social class and social mobility. Social Science &amp; Medicine. 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2017.11.037 &lt;/ref&gt;. This advocates for the redefinition of health and health care away from prevention and treatment of illness only to one of promoting well-being in general.  Under this model, some previous illnesses (e.g., mental ill health) are recognized as behavior disturbances only, and other types of medicine (e.g., complementary or [[alternative medicine]] and [[traditional medicine]]) are studied by the [[medicine]] researchers, sometimes with the aid of health geographers without [[medical education]]. This shift changes the definition of care, no longer limiting it to spaces such as hospitals or doctor's offices. Also, the social model gives priority to the intimate encounters performed at non-traditional spaces of medicine and healthcare as well as to the individuals as [[health consumerism|health consumers]].&lt;ref name= "Philo2"&gt;Philo, Chris (2009). "Health and Health Care". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al ''The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition)''. Oxford:Blackwell. pp.325-326&lt;/ref&gt;

This alternative methodological approach means that medical geography is broadened to incorporate philosophies such as [[Political Economy#Current approaches|Marxian political economy]], [[structuralism]], [[interactionism|social interactionism]], [[humanism]], [[feminism]] and [[queer theory]].&lt;ref name= "Philo"&gt;Philo, Chris (2009). "Medical Geography". In Gregory, Derek; Johnston, Ron; Pratt, Geraldine et. al ''The Dictionary of Human Geography (Fifth Edition)''. Oxford:Blackwell. pp.451-453&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The relationship between space and health dates back to [[Hippocrates]], who stated that "airs, waters, places" all played significant roles impacting human health and history.&lt;ref name= "Philo" /&gt; A classic piece of research in health geography was done in 1854 as [[Broad Street cholera outbreak|a cholera outbreak]] gripped a neighborhood in [[London]]. Death tolls rang around the clock and the people feared that they were being infected by vapors coming from the ground. [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] predicted that if he could locate the source of the disease, it could be contained. He drew maps demonstrating the homes of people who had died of cholera and the locations of water pumps. He found that one pump, the public pump on Broad Street, was central to most of the victims. He concluded that infected water from the pump was the culprit.  He instructed the authorities to remove the handle to the pump, making it unusable. As a result, the number of new cholera cases decreased.

==Areas of study==
Health geography is considered to be divided into two distinct elements. The first of which is focused on geographies of disease and ill health, involving [[descriptive research]] quantifying disease frequencies and distributions, and [[Analytic and enumerative statistical studies|analytic research]] concerned with finding what characteristics make an individual or [[population]] susceptible to disease. This requires an understanding of [[epidemiology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ocaña-Riola |first=Ricardo |year=2010 |title=Common errors in disease mapping |journal=Geospatial Health |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=139–54 |pmid=20503184 |url=http://www.geospatialhealth.unina.it/fulltext.php?f=pdf&amp;ida=90 |doi=10.4081/gh.2010.196}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second component of health geography is the geography of health care, primarily facility location, accessibility, and utilization.  This requires the use of [[spatial analysis]] and often borrows from [[behavioral economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/1353-8292(95)00002-4 | title=Coming out: exposing social theory in medical geography | journal=Health | date=1995 | volume=1 | issue=1 | pages=5–14 | first=Andréa | last=Litva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Geographies of disease and ill health ===
Hsenting health risks, from [[natural disaster]]s, to interpersonal [[violence]], [[stress (biology)|stress]], and other potential dangers.&lt;ref name="Philo2" /&gt;

=== Geography of health care provision ===
[[File:Coverage by Type of Health Insurance- 2008 and 2009p25.pdf|thumb]]
Although healthcare is a public good, it is not equally available to all [[individuals]]. Demand for public services is continuously increasing. People need advance knowledge and the latest prediction technology, that health geography offers. The latest example of such technology is Telemedicine. Many people in the United States are not able to access proper healthcare because of inequality in health insurance and the means to afford medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2016/02/money-quality-health-care-longer-life/|title=The costs of inequality: Money = quality health care = longer life|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2017-02-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobility and Disease Tracking

With the advent of mobile technology and its spread, it is now possible to track [[individual mobility]]. By correlating the movement of individuals through tracking the devices using access towers or other tracking systems, it is now possible to determine and even control disease spread. While [[privacy law]]s question the legality of tracking individuals, the commercial mobile service providers are using covert techniques or obtaining government waivers to allow permission to track people .

'''IEC 61131''' is an [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standard for [[programmable logic controller|programmable controllers]]. It was known as IEC 1131 before the change in numbering system by IEC. The parts of the IEC 61131 standard are prepared and maintained working group 7, programmable control systems, of subcommittee SC 65B of [[List of IEC technical committees|Technical Committee]] TC65 of the [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]].

==Sections of IEC 61131==
Standard ''IEC 61131'' is divided into several parts:&lt;ref&gt;[https://webstore.iec.ch/searchform&amp;q=61131 All parts available for "IEC 61131"], IEC Webstore&lt;/ref&gt;
* Part 1: General information. It is the introductory chapter; it contains definitions of terms that are used in the subsequent parts of the standard and outlines the main functional properties and characteristics of PLCs.
* Part 2: Equipment requirements and tests - establishes the requirements and associated tests for programmable controllers and their peripherals.  This standard prescribes: the normal service conditions and requirements (for example, requirements related with climatic conditions, transport and storage, electrical service, etc.); functional requirements (power supply &amp; memory, digital and analog [[I/O]]s); functional type tests and verification (requirements and tests on environmental, vibration, drop, free fall, I/O, power ports, etc.) and [[electromagnetic compatibility]] (EMC) requirements and tests that programmable controllers must implement.  This standard can serve as a basis in the evaluation of safety programmable controllers to [[IEC 61508]].

== History and mission ==
[[File:Yale Law School in the Sterling Law Building.jpg|thumb|Yale Law School in the Sterling Law Building]]
The ISP was founded by Yale Law Professor [[Jack Balkin]] in 1997 and celebrated its 15th year in 2012. It now hosts a number of initiatives, including the Abrams Institute for Freedom of Expression, the Knight Law and Media Program, and the Thomson Reuters Initiative on Law and Technology. The center is housed on the fourth floor of 40 Ashmun Street in New Haven.

ISP fellows from around the globe come to pursue research and produce scholarship, in the form of books, articles in academic journals and popular publications, blog posts, and policy documents. Yale ISP faculty and fellows have also conducted major public policy reviews of current issues in technology and law, and written amicus briefs for cases appearing before the Supreme Court and US Courts of Appeal.

==Projects and initiatives==

===Access to Knowledge===

For several years, the ISP has collaborated on A2K projects with partner institutions in Egypt, Brazil, and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isp.yale.edu/access-knowledge/ Access to Knowledge]&lt;/ref&gt; This work has involved several workshops and conferences organized by ISP fellows, and culminated in a series of books, including ''Access to Knowledge in India: New Research on Intellectual Property''&lt;ref name="A2K in India"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=R_-0-KVs5C0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Access+to+Knowledge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wsQgVM6-NMGUgwSd-oHgAQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Access%20to%20Knowledge%22&amp;f=false], Access to Knowledge in India: New Research on Intellectual Property, London: Bloomsbury Press.&lt;/ref&gt; edited by [[Ramesh Subramarian]] and [[Lea Shaver]], and ''Access to Knowledge in Brazil: New Research on Intellectual Property''&lt;ref name="A2K in Brazil"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fEP2smsHVCwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Access+to+Knowledge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wsQgVM6-NMGUgwSd-oHgAQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Access%20to%20Knowledge%22&amp;f=false], Access to Knowledge in Brazil: New Research on Intellectual Property, London: Bloomsbury Press.&lt;/ref&gt; edited by [[Lea Shaver]].

===Floyd Abrams Institute for Freedom of Expression===

The Institute's mission is both practical and scholarly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isp.yale.edu/node/4938/ Floyd Abrams Institute for Freedom of Expression]  &lt;/ref&gt;It includes a clinic for Yale Law students to engage in litigation, draft model legislation, and advise lawmakers and policy makers on issues of media freedom and informational access. It promotes scholarship and law reform on emerging questions concerning both traditional and new media. The Institute also holds scholarly conferences and events at Yale on First Amendment issues and on related issues of access to information, Internet and media law, telecommunications, privacy, and intellectual property. The Abrams Institute fellow for 2014-2015 is [[Jonathan Manes]].

The Abrams Institute is a Partnering Organization in Free Speech Week, a yearly non-partisan week-long celebration of Freedom of Speech and Expression.

===Knight Law and Media Program===

The program includes courses related to law and media; writing workshops; speakers, conferences and events; and career counseling and support for summer internships. The Program's director is Professor Jack Balkin. The Law School received a grant from [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation]] to support many of these efforts through the Knight Law and Media Scholars Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isp.yale.edu/node/4939/ Knight Law and Media Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Fall 2014, the [[Tow Center for Digital Journalism]] at [[Columbia Journalism School]] and the Information Society Project of [[Yale Law School]] have partnered to present this series of 5 lectures as part of the larger Journalism After Snowden project. Journalism After Snowden, funded by The Tow Foundation and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation is a yearlong series of events, research projects and writing from the Tow Center for Digital Journalism in collaboration with Columbia Journalism Review.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.knightfoundation.org/press-room/press-release/columbia-universitys-journalism-after-snowden-init/&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers have included [[Ethan Zucherman]], [[James Bamford]],&lt;ref&gt;http://isp.yale.edu/event/journalism-after-snowden-lecture-dr-james-bamford&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jil Abramson]].&lt;ref&gt;http://isp.yale.edu/event/journalism-after-snowden-jill-abramson&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign Affairs in the Internet Age ===

The initiative studies the ways that foreign policy affects Internet governance, and the ways that the Internet has changed how foreign policy is conducted. It represents a collaboration between the Information Society Project (ISP) and scholars of international law and politics at Yale Law School.&lt;ref&gt; [http://isp.yale.edu/foreign-affairs-internet-age/ Foreign Affairs in the Internet Age]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yale faculty members [[Jack Balkin]], [[David Grewal]], [[Oona Hathaway]], and [[Amy Kapczynski]] lead this initiative. FAIA works collaboratively with Yale Law students and co-sponsors events with the Yale Law National Security Group and the Yale Journal of Law and Technology.

=== Thomson Reuters Initiative on Law and Technology ===

The [[Thomson Reuters]] Initiative on Law and Technology supports ISP's "ideas" lunches, and the Thomson Reuters ISP Speaker Series on Information Law and Information Policy. Topics have included copyright and net neutrality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isp.yale.edu/node/4936/ Thomson Reuters Initiative on Law and Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://foxct.com/2014/11/11/the-fight-over-how-you-use-the-internet-just-went-to-a-whole-new-level/&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, the Yale Law School Information Society Project hosted a conference on Innovation Law Beyond IP. Attendees included [[Mark Lemley]], [[Amy Kapczynski]], [[Yochai Benkler]], [[Lisa Larrimore Ouellette]], [[John Golden]], [[Hannah Wiseman]], [[Rebecca Eisenberg]], [[Michael Abramowicz]], [[Sean Pager]], [[Jessica Silbey]], [[Pamela Samuelson]], [[Barton Beebe]], [[Ian Ayres]], [[Brett Frischmann]], Mark McKenna, [[Bryan Choi]], [[Frank Pasquale]], [[Tal Zarsky]], [[Julie Cohen]], [[Margot Kaminski]], [[Michael Burstein]], [[Bhaven Sampat]], [[Brian Wright (lawyer)|Brian Wright]], [[Jonathan Masur]], [[Dan Burk]], [[Liza Vertinsky]], [[Roger Ford]], Sean O'Connor, Jim Bessen, Talha Syed, Arti Rai, [[Orly Lobel]], [[Mario Biagioli]], [[Rochelle C. Dreyfuss]], [[Ann Bartow]], Kiel Brennan-Marquez, [[Nicholson Price]], [[David Grewal]], and [[Jack Balkin]].&lt;ref name="Balkanization"&gt;[http://balkin.blogspot.com/2014/04/lingering-thoughts-about-innovation-law.html], Lingering Thoughts About the "Innovation Law Beyond IP" Conference by Michael Abramowicz in Balkanization.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Program for the Study of Reproductive Justice ===

The ISP's Program for the Study of Reproductive Justice (PSRJ) serves as a national center for academic research and development of new ideas to promote justice with respect to reproductive health issues, provide a supportive environment for young scholars interested in academic or advocacy careers focusing on reproductive rights and justice issues; and provide opportunities for communication between the academic and advocacy communities. [[Pricilla Smith]] is the program director of PSRJ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isp.yale.edu/node/4941/ Program for the Study of Reproductive Justice]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic===

The Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic (MFIA) is dedicated to increasing government transparency, defending the essential work of news gatherers, and protecting freedom of expression through [[impact litigation]], direct legal services, and policy work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isp.yale.edu/media-freedom-and-information-access-clinic/ Media Freedom and Information Access Clinic]&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:FOIA 2013.png|thumb|FOIA Boot Camp 2013]]

The clinic was established in 2009 by a group of Yale Law School students and, since then, has provided pro bono representation to clients on a diverse array of matters touching on issues of transparency, free speech, and press freedom. Clients include independent journalists, news organizations, public interest as well as advocacy organizations, activists, and researchers.  The practice is focused in the state and federal courts of Connecticut and New York, although the clinic has represented clients in many other parts of the country as well.

The clinic is co-taught by [[Jack Balkin]], Knight Professor of Constitutional Law and the First Amendment; David Schulz, Abrams Visiting Clinical Lecturer at Yale Law School and Partner at Levine, Sullivan, Koch &amp; Schulz LLP; and [[Jonathan Manes]], Abrams Clinical Fellow and Clinical Lecturer in Law. Schulz and Manes serve as supervising attorneys on the clinic's cases.

Every year, the clinic hosts a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|FOIA]] bootcamp.

MFIA is part of the Abrams Institute for Freedom of Expression, which is affiliated with and administered by the Information Society Project at Yale Law School.

=== Visual Law Project ===

The Yale Visual Law Project produces short documentary films on legal issues to advance public debate. Films include:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4858">An '''Institute of International Studies''' or '''Institute for International Studies''' is a type of [[research center]] that focuses on [[international studies]], [[international relations]], or [[area studies]]. It is often, though not always, part of a [[University|university or college]] where it is often affiliated with, and sometimes funded by, a university's [[Public policy school|public policy, public administration, or international relations school]], a degree-granting institution. These centers may also provide geographic areas of specializations, offer internship or study-abroad opportunities, and/or give support services to university students.

One of the earliest centers for international studies was founded in 1935 at [[Yale University]]. The Yale Institute for International Studies sought to establish a central point of contact for teaching and research on international affairs, societies, and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MacMillan Center expands commitment to graduate education with conference travel grants |url=https://macmillan.yale.edu/news/macmillan-center-expands-commitment-graduate-education-conference-travel-grants |website=Yale MacMillan Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s, it was renamed the Concilium on International and Area Studies, and later became the Yale Center for International and Area Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=https://macmillan.yale.edu/overview/history |website=Yale MacMillan Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars felt that scholars at the institute conducted too much research as individuals rather than in groups. Eight of these scholars moved to [[Princeton University]] where they founded the [[Center of International Studies]] in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Studies, The Center of, |url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/center_international_studies.html |website=A Princeton Companion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutes similar to those at Yale and Princeton soon emerged in the 1950s at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

'''Juhani Uolevi Pallasmaa''' (born 14 September 1936 in [[Hämeenlinna]], Finland) is a [[Finnish people|Finnish]] architect and former professor of architecture and dean at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]]. Among the many academic and civic positions he has held are those of Director of the Museum of Finnish Architecture 1978-1983, and head of the Institute of Industrial Arts, [[Helsinki]]. He established his own architect's office – Arkkitehtitoimisto Juhani Pallasmaa KY – in 1983 in Helsinki. From 2001 to 2003, he was  Raymond E. Maritz Visiting Professor of Architecture at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], and in 2013 he received an honorary doctorate from that university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://samfoxschool.wustl.edu/news/8941 Honorary WUSTL Degrees for 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010-2011, Pallasmaa served as Plym Distinguished Professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/juhani-pallasmaa-plym-distinguished-professor-in-architecture-2010-2011/oclc/810280328 WorldCat record for "Juhani Pallasmaa: Plym distinguished professor in architecture 2010-2011"]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012-2013 he was scholar in residence at [[Frank Lloyd Wright|Frank Lloyd Wright's]] [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taliesin.edu/faculty.html Taliesin Faculty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101071306/http://www.taliesin.edu/faculty.html |date= 1 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pallasmaa has also lectured widely in Europe, North and South America, Africa and Asia.

His exhibitions of Finnish architecture, planning and visual arts have been displayed in more than thirty countries and he has written numerous articles on cultural philosophy, [[environmental psychology]] and theories of architecture and the arts. Many of his articles are first featured in ''ARK'' (''The Finnish Architectural Review'').

Among Pallasmaa's many books on architectural theory is ''The Eyes of the Skin – Architecture and the Senses'', a book that has become a classic of architectural theory and is required reading on courses in many schools of architecture around the world.

A selection of essays written by Pallasmaa, from the early years to more recent ones, has been translated into English and collated together in the book ''Encounters – Architectural Essays'' (Helsinki, 2005), edited by Peter MacKeith. The book was shortlisted for the [[RIBA]] 2005 International Book Award.

In 2006 Pallasmaa turned 70, and the occasion was marked by the publication of the book ''Archipelago. Essays on Architecture'', edited by Peter MacKeith. The collection contains essays by 23 authors, all with some connection to Pallasmaa or MacKeith. They include: Karsten Harries, [[Daniel Hoffman|Dan Hoffman]], [[Steven Holl]], [[Colin St. John Wilson]] and [[Daniel Libeskind]].

Pallasmaa is a member of the [[Finnish Association of Architects]], and an honorary [[Fellow of the American Institute of Architects|Fellow]] of the [[American Institute of Architects]].  During the spring of 2010, Pallasmaa, along with American playwright Leigh Fondakowski, was an Imagine Fund Distinguished Visiting Chair at the [[Institute for Advanced Study at University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121210122720/http://ias.umn.edu/2010/04/05/imagine-fund-chairs-april-2010/ Imagine Fund Chairs]&lt;/ref&gt; Pallasmaa was jury member for the 2014 [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pritzkerprize.com/about/jury-bios Pritzker Architecture Prize 2014 Jury Members]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural career==
[[File:Pallasmaa Kamppi.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Kamppi Center]], Helsinki, 2003-06]]
[[File:Itis 2014 sisältä 06.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Itäkeskus]] Shopping Centre, Helsinki, 1989-91]]

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Moduli 225, model industrial summer house, 1969-1971.jpg|thumb|200px|Moduli 225 industrially-produced summer house (with Kristian Gullichsen), 1969-71.]] --&gt;
In terms of architectural production, the work Juhani Pallasmaa has undergone a shift during his career. His early career is characterised by concerns with rationalism, standardization and prefabrication. This was partly due to the influence of his mentor Professor Aulis Blomstedt, who was very much concerned with proportional systems and standardization. Pallasmaa's first key work demonstrating these principles was the Moduli 225 (with [[Kristian Gullichsen]]), an industrial-produced summer house, 1969-1971, of which around six were built in Finland. However, the key models for this type of architecture were both Japanese architecture and the refined abstractions of [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]. In Finland this type of architecture is referred to as "constructivism" - with only a family resemblance to the avant-gardist [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivism]] - and at that time, the late 1950s and 1960s, stood in opposition to the work of [[Alvar Aalto]], who was increasingly seen in his home country as an idiosyncratic individualist. But the interest in Japan also contained the seeds for Pallasmaa's later concerns; materiality and a phenomenology of experience. It was after returning from teaching in Africa that Pallasmaa turned away from pure constructivism, and took up his concerns with psychology, culture, and [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]]. His concern for details and small works such as exhibition design has sometimes earned him the label "jewel-box architect". 2006 saw the completion of his largest ever work, the [[Kamppi Center]], incorporating the main  bus station, a shopping centre and housing in central Helsinki, though the work was split up into different sections involving various architects, and overall design was under the control of architects Helin &amp; Co.

'''Land recycling''' is the reuse of abandoned, vacant, or underused properties for [[redevelopment]] or repurposing.

Land recycling aims to ensure the reuse of [[developed land]] as part of: new developments; [[decontamination|cleaning up]] contaminated properties; reuse and/or making use of used land surrounded by development or nearby infrastructure. End-uses from land recycling may include: mixed-use, residential, commercial, or industrial developments; and/or [[Public space|public open space]] such as [[urban open space]] use by [[urban park]]s, [[community garden]]s; or larger [[open space reserve]]s such as [[regional park]]s.

Since many abandoned and underutilized properties lie within economically distressed and disadvantaged communities, land recycling often benefits and stimulates re-investment in historically under-served areas. The real or perceived presence of [[xenobiotic]] [[hazardous substance]]s from historical previous uses or ''in situ'' [[land pollution]], causing [[soil contamination]] and [[groundwater pollution]], may complicate the redevelopment of such properties. Such environmentally distressed properties, with site cleanup and mitigation considerations, are commonly referred to as [[brownfield]]s.

==Synonyms==
Other commonly used terms can relate to or serve as synonyms of land recycling:

* '''[[Infill|Infill development]]''': development that takes place within existing communities, making maximum use of the existing [[infrastructure]] instead of building on previously undeveloped land; 
* '''[[Sustainable development]]''': Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs; and
* '''[[Brownfield land|Brownfield development]]''': development of [[real property]] for which its reuse may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a [[dangerous goods|hazardous substance]], pollutant or contaminant.

==Benefits==

The US Government [[Accountability Office]] estimates that there are over 450,000 brownfields and almost {{convert|15|e6acre|km2}} of potentially contaminated properties across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Brownfield Redevelopment: Stakeholders Report That EPA's Program Helps to Redevelop Sites, but Additional Measures Could Complement Agency Efforts
GAO-05-94; December 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; These sites sit idle and neglected, serving as desolate eyesores within their communities. By putting these barren infill sites to use, land recycling revitalizes communities, promotes [[sustainable development]], and preserves precious [[land resource|resources]]. The social, economic, environmental, and other benefits of land recycling include:

* Social and economic [[revitalization]]
* Sustainability
* An alternative to [[urban sprawl|sprawl]]
* Direction of [[economic development|development]] to urban cores
* Addressing [[climate change]]{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Social and economic revitalization===

Land recycling helps clean up and revitalize inner cities by returning abandoned, idle, or underused sites to productive use, bolstering [[community spirit]], creating jobs and boosting local tax-revenues.

The re-use of land revitalizes communities and renews economic activity, particularly in under-served urban areas. Abandoned, idled, and vacant properties often lie in former industrial and commercial areas, typically in urban and historically disadvantaged areas. These sites can be community eyesores, negatively impacting social and economic development, and often human and [[environmental health]]. The failure to redevelop brownfields in particular translates into potentially more exposure to toxics and the loss of economic and housing benefits that can come from appropriate redevelopment.

By putting these properties to new and productive use, land recycling encourages growth of [[business]]es and services in such areas, helping to break up concentrations of [[poverty]], creating jobs, and stimulating additional private investment and local tax-revenue. An abandoned, well-situated, factory site can be cleaned up and redeveloped into a much-needed mixed-use development with a grocery store, senior housing, and access to public transportation. The addition of neighborhood-serving retail, affordable housing, or a clean public park in a disadvantaged community can boost local spirit and improve overall quality of life.

===Sustainability===
[[Sustainability]] involves meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.

Land recycling expresses an inherently sustainable idea, based on the same common-sense as recycling an aluminum can. Like other natural resources, land represents a shared investment that should be reused and recycled, rather than [[land consumption|consumed]] and abandoned after use. [[Recycling paper]] saves trees, reusing land saves land.

By encouraging the recycling rather than the consumption of land, land recycling promotes [[smart growth]] and responsible, sustainable patterns of development. A 2001 study by George Washington University shows that for every acre of brownfield redeveloped, {{convert|4.5|acre|m2}} of undeveloped land is conserved.
[http://www.gwu.edu/~eem/Brownfields/project_report/chapters-html.htm#chapter5 Public Policies and Private Decisions Affecting the Redevelopment of Brownfields: An Analysis of Critical Factors, Relative Weights and Areal Differentials]. As most brownfields and other abandoned sites are typically situated in urban areas, they tap into existing nearby infrastructure, limiting the need to build new roads, gridlines, and amenities, thereby reducing further land consumption. Each infill development prevents sprawl into open space, forests and agricultural land, preserving acres of undeveloped land.

===An alternative to sprawl===
Land recycling increases density in urban areas, by reducing [[urban sprawl]] and unplanned, low-density, [[automobile]]-dependent developments.

Sprawl development scatters housing, public transit, jobs and other amenities farther apart, demanding more frequent use of cars for travel. The increase in vehicle-miles traveled (VMTs) produces a range of health and environmental problems, including air pollution and increased greenhouse gas emissions, and increased incidence of traffic jams and asthma. This results in a lower quality of life for residents, ever-increasing commute times, and the health implications of smog.

By moving new jobs, economic opportunities and community amenities farther from established populations, sprawl development can cripple once-thriving cities. This trend takes a toll on the socio-economic health of urban communities as growth retreats from the urban center.

Rather than take advantage of existing infrastructure such as roads, public transit, and public works, building sprawl projects abandons these resources and demands further consumption of land and resources.

Land recycling offers an intelligent alternative to sprawl development. It reuses vital infrastructure and public resources and creates compact, full-service neighborhoods that reduce [[vehicle use]] and [[carbon dependence]]. Rebuilding in urban neighborhoods generates reinvestment in vibrant economic and cultural centers, rather than drawing away much-needed resources. Compact, urban development through land recycling is essential to sustainable development and is key to managing rapid population growth across the United States and beyond. As daily commute times decrease, the general quality of life improves as residents have more time to enjoy the world around them.

===Directing development to urban cores===
Redirecting population growth and growth of businesses to already urbanized areas is integral to fostering sustainable communities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Applying sustainable principles to land use and growth management requires that growth be redirected from scattered fringe areas back to our urban cores, where people, services and infrastructure already exist. Building up our urban areas positively increases population density, providing the critical mass to support local services from coffee shops to grocery stores, public transit to libraries and symphony halls. Land recycling provides opportunities for urban renewal and to build truly livable communities: efficient, compact, vibrant urban neighborhoods integrated with public transit systems, which offer a mix of uses as well as affordable housing.

===Addressing climate change===
Land recycling effectively curbs [[greenhouse gas|greenhouse-gas]] emissions by encouraging smart, compact growth that reduces [[vehicle dependence]]. Redevelopment within an urban core reduces commuting distances and therefore average vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by creating residential, office, and other amenities within close proximity. Since transportation alone accounts for a third of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted in the United States, land recycling offers a key tool in any fight against climate change.  A recent Urban Land Institute study found that compact urban developments reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled (VMTs) by 20 to 40 percent &lt;ref&gt;Urban Land Institute.  Growing Cooler: The Evidence of Urban Development and Climate Change.  Available at  {{cite web|url=http://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224212241/http://smartgrowthamerica.org/gcindex.html |archivedate=2010-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; because users are closer to amenities and can more easily rely on public transportation. Smart urban planning is therefore crucial to maximizing energy savings and overall reduction of greenhouse gases.

{{As of | 2009}} the green movement has started to emphasize the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) Green Building Rating System, a certification system that rewards the design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings. LEED certification signifies incorporation of smart building design and technology to reduce energy use and minimize waste. However, even if a building is energy-efficient, the energy required to travel to and from a LEED certified site may well exceed the energy saved through energy-efficient features. LEED certified buildings and other developments best benefit climate change when they reuse infill sites and access existing resources.

==Challenges==
While land recycling has great economic and environmental benefits, without the right tools, skills, and knowledge, reusing land can produce certain challenges.  Obstacles to redevelopment may include lack of funding and increased scrutiny. These can particularly impede projects on brownfields, which carry the stigma of contamination. Because of these concerns, the perceived ease of developing on open land, or [[greenfield land|greenfields]], remains alluring to many. Factors that hinder land recycling include:

* market factors
* environmental-liability risks
* uncertainty and cost
* complicated/confusing regulatory requirements
* difficulty in obtaining project financing
* the lure of greenfields

===Market factors===
As the saying goes, in [[real estate]] only three things matter: location, location, location. Because idled and underused infill sites are often located in distressed urban areas concerns arise about crime, safety, and access to quality education and services. These and other market factors frequently pull development to open land near traditionally desirable communities and away from urban infill sites.

====Greenfields competition====
Brownfields and infill sites must compete with attractive, undeveloped suburban and rural land, also called [[greenfield land]]. When considering the real or perceived risks and costs of land recycling, a greenfield development may seem more economically sensible as the immediate costs are typically less than developing on an infill or brownfield site. However, it is important to consider the long-term economic gain of land recycling and the added social and environmental rewards of sustainable development.

===Brownfields===
As defined by the US Environmental Protection Agency, a [[brownfield]] site is “real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant”. In other words, brownfield sites comprise abandoned, idled, or underused industrial and commercial facilities where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by real or perceived environmental contamination.

====Uncertainty and costs====
Assessing whether or not a site is contaminated can be a costly process that deters land reuse. Potential purchasers are often unwilling or unable to risk an investment in a site assessment for a property that may require cleanup they cannot afford. Even if a site has been purchased, concerns over cleanup costs may further stall redevelopment. Uncertainty over time, cost or a high price for cleanup leaves many brownfield sites in development limbo.

====Project financing====
Obtaining private front-end financing for brownfield cleanup can be a difficult process{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}. Since financing is more readably available for development on greenfields, infill and brownfield sites are often passed over.

===Environmental-liability risks===
Although recent changes in some country's federal laws provide some liability relief to new purchasers of contaminated properties, the law remains very complex and many state laws still have strict liability covering real property. Thus, in many cases, any current or past property owner can potentially be legally and financially liable regardless of who is responsible for contamination. This liability web continues to throw a chill on many brownfield projects even in the presence of regulatory reforms designed to encourage redevelopment. A common belief among many brownfield owners is that it is less risky and cheaper to abandon or “mothball” a facility than to conduct a site assessment that could trigger large cleanup costs and potential liability.

====Regulatory requirements====
The potentially complex process of successfully redeveloping an infill site, particularly a brownfield, can challenge land recycling interest and proposals.  Understanding and complying with federal, state, and local legal and regulatory requirements can be daunting for some property owners and developers. Guidance from legal specialists and environmental cleanup consultants is often needed to design, develop, and guide a project through the process of regulatory requirements and permitting approvals.

Jordan''' is the [[Andrew Mellon]] Professor of Christian Thought at [[Harvard Divinity School]] and Professor of the Studies of Women, Gender, and Sexuality in the [[Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences]]. His focus is on [[European philosophy]], [[gender studies]], and [[sexuality]]. Much of his early work related to Catholic teachings of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. In recent years, he has more specifically focused on religious doctrine and its relation to [[LGBT]] issues.

In addition to his scholarship and classroom teaching, Jordan has discussed sexual and religious issues to audiences that range from college lectureships to [[National Public Radio]], the ''[[New York Times]]'', and [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2009/10/28/harvard-professor-seeks-gay-term-in-bible/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.emory.edu/EMORY_REPORT/erarchive/2002/July/erJuly.22/7_22_02profile.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2012/3/23/jordan-hds-professor/]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12669">The '''Mechanostat''' is a term describing the way in which mechanical loading influences bone structure by changing the mass (amount of bone) and architecture (its arrangement) to provide a structure that resists habitual loads with an economical amount of material.  As changes in the skeleton are accomplished by the processes of formation ([[bone growth]]) and resorption (bone loss), the mechanostat models the effect of influences on the skeleton by those processes, through their effector cells, osteocytes, osteoblasts and osteoclasts. The term was invented by [[Harold Frost]] an orthopaedic surgeon and researcher and described extensively in articles referring to Frost and Webster Jee's ''Utah Paradigm of Skeletal Physiology''&lt;ref name="Frost1"&gt;Frost H.M.: ''Defining Osteopenias and Osteoporoses: Another View (With Insights From a New Paradigm)'', Bone 1997, Vol. 20, No. 5, 385–391, {{PMID|9145234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frost2"&gt;Frost H.M.: ''The Utah Paradigm of Skeletal Physiology Vol. 1'', ISMNI, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frost3"&gt;Frost H.M.: ''The Utah Paradigm of Skeletal Physiology Vol. 2'', ISMNI, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frost4"&gt;Frost H.M.: ''The Utah paradigm of skeletal physiology: an overview of its insights for bone, cartilage and collagenous tissue organs'', J Bone Miner Metab. 2000; 18:305–316, {{PMID|11052462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frost5"&gt;Frost H.M., Schoenau E.: ''The muscle-bone unit in children and adolescents: an overview'', 2000, J. Pediatr Endorcrinol Metab 13:571–590, {{PMID|10905381}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s. The Mechanostat is often defined as a practical description of [[Wolff's law]] described by [[Julius Wolff (surgeon)|Julius Wolff]] (1836–1902), but this is not completely accurate.  Wolff wrote his treatises on bone after images of bone sections were described by Culmann and von Meyer, who suggested that the arrangement of the struts (trabeculae) at the ends of the bones were aligned with the stresses experienced by the bone.  It has since been established that the static methods used for those calculations of lines of stress were inappropriate for work on what were in effect curved beams, a finding described by Lance Lanyon, a leading researcher in the area as "a triumph of a good idea over mathematics".  While Wolff pulled together the work of Culmann and von Meyer, it was the French scientist Roux, who first used the term "functional adaptation" to describe the way that the skeleton optimized itself for its function, even though Wolff is credited by many for that. 

According to the Mechanostat, bone growth and bone loss is stimulated by the local mechanical elastic deformation of bone. The reason for the elastic deformation of bone is the peak forces caused by muscles (e.g. measurable using [[mechanography]]). The Adaptation (feed-back [[control loop]]) of bone according to the maximum forces is considered to be a lifelong process. Hence bone adapts its mechanical properties according to the needed mechanical function – bone mass, bone geometry and hence bone [[Strength of materials|strength]] (see also [[Stress-strain index]], SSI) is adapted according to the everyday usage / needs. "maximal force" in this context is a simplification of the real input to bone that initiates adaptive changes.  While the magnitude of a force (the weight of a load for example) is an important determinant of its effect on the skeleton, it is not the only one.  The rate of application of force is also critical.  Slow application of force over several seconds is not experienced by bone cells as a stimulus, but they are sensitive to very rapid application of forces (such as impacts) even of lower magnitude.  High frequency vibration of bone at very low magnitudes is thought to stimulate changes but the research in the area is not completely unequivocal.  It is clear that bones respond better to loading/exercise with gaps between individual events so that two loads separated by 10 seconds of rest are a more potent stimulus than 10 loads within the same 10 second period.   

Due to this control loop, there is a linear relationship in the healthy body between muscle cross sectional area (as a surrogate for typical maximum forces the muscle is able to produce under physiological conditions) and the bone cross sectional area (as a surrogate for bone strength).&lt;ref name="Schoenau2"&gt;Schoenau E., NeuC.M., Beck B., Manz F., Rauch F.: ''Bone Mineral content per Muscle Cross-Sectional Area as an Index of the Functional Muscle-Bone Unit'', J Bone Mineral Res, Vol.17, S.1095–1101, 2002, {{PMID|12054165}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schiessl1"&gt;Schießl H., Frost H.M., Jee W.S.S.: ''Estrogen and BoneMuscle Strength and Mass Relationships'', Bone, Vol.22, S.1–6, 1998, {{PMID|9437507}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These relations are of immense importance especially for bone loss situations like in [[osteoporosis]], since an adapted training utilizing the needed maximum forces on the bone can be used to stimulate bone growth and hence prevent or help to minimize bone loss. An example for such an efficient training is [[vibration training]] or [[whole body vibration]].

== Modeling and remodeling ==
Frost defined four regions of elastic bone deformation which result in different consequences on the control loop: 
 [[Image:UtahParadigm.jpg|thumb|350px|Mechanostat: Modeling- and Remodeling Thresholds]]
*'''Disuse:'''&lt;br&gt; Strain &lt; circa 800μStrain: Remodeling (bone adaptation and bone repair) Bone mass and bone strength is reduced.
*'''Adapted State:'''&lt;br&gt; strain between ca. 800μStrain and ca. 1500μStrain: Remodeling (bone repair) Bone mass and bone strength stays constant (homeostasis: bone resorption=bone formation)
*'''Overload:'''&lt;br&gt; Strain &gt; circa 1500μStrain: Modeling (bone growth) bone mass and bone strength is increased
*'''Fracture:'''&lt;br&gt; Strain &gt; circa 15000μStrain: maximum elastically deformation exceeded – bone fracture.

According to this a typical bone, e.g. the [[tibia]] has a security margin of about 5 to 7 between typical load (2000 to 3000 μStrain) and fracture load (about 15000μStrain).

The comments above are all one part of the way the skeleton responds to loading, because the different bones of the skeleton have a range of habituial strain environments (encompassing magnitude, rate, frequency rest periods etc) and they are not uniform.  The numbers in the table are theoretical only and may reflect the response of the centre of a long bone under specific circumstances.  Other parts of the same bone and other bones in the same individual experience different loading and adapt to them despite different thresholds between disuse, maintenance and adaptive formation.  Furthermore bone structure is controlled by a complex series of different influences such as calcium status the effects of hormones, age, diet, sex, disease, and pharmaceuticals.  A bone experiencing what would in some circumstances be seen as a stimulus to form more material could either be maintained at a constant level where circulating calcium was low, or the same loading could merely temper the amount of resorption experienced in an old person with a bone wasting disease.   

== Unit: Strain ''E''==
The elastic deformation of bone is measured in ''μStrain''.&lt;ref name="Frost2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frost3"/&gt; 1000μStrain = 0.1% change of length of the bone.
*Strain ''E'' at length ''l'' and change of length Δ''l'': &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{\Delta l}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

It has to be considered that bone strength is highly dependent on geometry and direction of the acting forces in relation to this geometry. The fracture load for axial forces of the tibia for example is about 50 to 60 times the body weight. The fracture load for forces perpendicular to the axial direction is about 10 times lower.

Different type of bones can have different modelling and remodelling thresholds. The modeling threshold of the tibia is about 1500 μStrain (0.15% change of length), the modelling threshold for parts of the bone of the skull is quite different. Some parts of the skull such as the lower jaw (mandible) experience significant forces and strains during chewing, but the dome of the cranium for example must remain present and strong to protect the brain even if it does not experience what would be seen as stimulating strains.  In one study where the strains were measured in the skull of a live human (Hillam et al J.Biomech2016) it was shown that strains in the skull never exceeded 1/10 of the peak strain in the tibia of the same individual, with similar differences in strain rates.  This suggests that either bones of the skull are very sensitive to extremely low strains, or that the "genetic baseline" amount of bone in the skull in what is effectively disuse is not modified by the effects of loading.  Whether the skulls of boxers are thicker than normal individuals is an intriguing question that has not been answered.
 
Since the physical material properties of bone (as a material) are not altered in the different bone types of the body, this difference in modelling threshold results in an increased bone mass and bone strength and hence in an increased safety factor (relation between fracture load and typical loads) for the skull compared to the tibia. A lower modeling threshold means that the same typical daily forces result in a ‘thicker’ and hence stronger bone at the skull.

==Examples==
Typical examples of the influence of maximum forces and the resulting elastic deformations on bone growth or bone loss are extended flights of [[astronauts]] and [[cosmonauts]] as well as patient with [[paraplegia]] due to an accident.  Extended periods in free fall do not lead to loss of bone from the skull, providing support to the idea that its bone is maintained by a genetic not a mechanical influence.  (Skull bone often increases in long term space flights, something thought to be related to fluid shifts within the body.) 
For example, a patient in a  wheel chair who is using his arms but due to his paraplegia not his legs will suffer massive muscle and bone loss only in his legs due to the lack of usage of the legs. However the muscles and bones of the arms which are used every day will stay the same or might even be increased depending on the usage.&lt;ref name="Eser1"&gt;Eser P. et al.: ''Relationship between duration of paralysis and bone structure: a pQCT Study of spinal cord injured individuals'', Bone, Vol.34, S.869–880, 2004, {{PMID|15121019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same effect can be observed for long flight Astronauts or Cosmonauts.&lt;ref name="Blottner1"&gt;Blottner D., Salanova M., Püttmann B., Schiffl G., Felsenberg D., Buehring B., Rittweger J.: ''Human skeletal muscle structure and function preserved by vibration muscle exercise following 55 days of [[bed rest]]'', Eur J. Appl Physiol, 2006, Vol. 97, S. 261–271, {{DOI|10.1007/s00421-006-0160-6}} {{PMID|16568340}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they still use their arms in an almost normal manner due to the lack of gravity in space there are no maximum forces induced on the bones of the legs.  On earth, long term players of racquet sports experience similar effects, where the dominant arm can have 30% more bone than the other due to the asymmetric applications of force.

Harold Frost applied the Mechanostat model not only to skeletal tissues but also to fibrous collagenous connective tissues, such as ligaments, tendons and fascia.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Harold "New targets for fascial, ligament and tendon research: A perspective from the Utah paradigm of skeletal physiology" J Musculoskel Neuron Interact 2003; 3(3):201–209&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Harold "The physiology of cartilagenous, fibrous, and bony tissue. C.C. Thomas, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; He described their adaptational responsiveness to strain in his "stretch-hypertrophy rule": 
:"Intermittent stretch causes collagenous tissues to hypertrophy until the resulting increase in strength reduces elongation in tension to some minimum level".&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Harold "The physiology of cartilagenous, fibrous, and bony tissue. C.C. Thomas, 1972, page 176&lt;/ref&gt; 
Similar to the responsiveness of bony tissues this adaptational response occurs only if the mechanical strain exceeds a certain threshold value. Harold Frost proposed that for dense collagenous connective tissues the related threshold value is around 4% strain elongation.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Harold "Does the anterior cruciate have a modeling threshold? A case for the affirmative". J Musculoskel Neuron Interact 2001; 2(2):131–136&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''''{{Lang|de|Musikalisches Würfelspiel}}''''' (German for "musical dice game") was a system for using [[dice]] to randomly '[[generative music|generate]]' [[music]] from [[music composition|precomposed]] options. These 'games' were quite popular throughout Western Europe in the 18th century. Several different [[game]]s were devised, some that did not require dice, but merely 'choosing a [[random]] [[number]].'

The earliest example is [[Johann Philipp Kirnberger]]'s ''{{Lang|de|Der allezeit fertige Menuetten- und Polonaisencomponist}}'' (German for "The Ever-Ready Minuet and Polonaise Composer") (1757 [1st edition; revised 2nd 1783]).&lt;ref name="Algorithmic"&gt;Nierhaus, Gerhard (2009). ''Algorithmic Composition: Paradigms of Automated Music Generation'', pp. 36 &amp; 38n7. {{ISBN|9783211755396}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples by well known composers include [[C. P. E. Bach]]'s ''{{Lang|de|Einfall, einen doppelten Contrapunct in der Octave von sechs Tacten zu machen, ohne die Regeln davon zu wissen}}'' (German for "A method for making six bars of double counterpoint at the octave without knowing the rules") (1758) and [[Maximilian Stadler]]'s ''{{Lang|fr|Table pour composer des minuets et des Trios à la infinie; avec deux dez à jouer}}'' (French for "A table for composing minuets and trios to infinity, by playing with two dice") (1780).&lt;ref name="Algorithmic" /&gt;

In the early 20th century the Kaleidacousticon System, using arbitrarily combinable [[playing card]]s, was unsuccessfully marketed in the Boston area as a [[parlour game]].&lt;ref&gt;Nierhaus (2009), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetics==
According to Lawrence Zbikowski, "In truth, chance played little part in the success of the music produced by such games. Instead, what was required of the compilers...[was] a little knowledge about how to put the game together and an understanding of the formal design of waltzes, etc."&lt;ref&gt;Zbikowski, Lawrence M. (2002). ''Conceptualizing Music: Cognitive Structure, Theory, and Analysis'', pp. 142–143. {{ISBN|9780195187977}}. Quoted in Berkowitz, Aaron (2010). ''The Improvising Mind: Cognition and Creativity in the Musical Moment'', p. 65. {{ISBN|9780199590957}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stephen Hedges, "The 'galant' middle class in Europe was playing with mathematics. In this atmosphere of investigation and cataloguing, a systematic device that would seem to make it possible for anyone to write music was practically guaranteed popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Hedges, Stephen A. (1978). "Dice Music in the Eighteenth Century", pp. 184–185, ''Music and Letters 59'': 180–87. Quoted in Berkowitz (2010), p. 65n60.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Leonard Meyer]], "Eighteenth-century composers constructed musical dice games while nineteenth century composers did not. ... [W]hat constrained the choice of figures [in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century music] were the claims of taste, coherent expression and propriety, given the genre of work being composed, rather than the inner necessity of a gradually unfolding, underlying process [as in nineteenth century music]".&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Leonard (1989). ''Style and Music: Theory, History, and Ideology'', p. 193. {{ISBN|9780226521527}}.&lt;/ref&gt; See: [[musical development]].

The way these games work may be understood in analogy to [[generative grammar|sentence construction]].
 1 The cow   ran    past    the field.
 2 The pig   walked through the yard.
 3 The sheep ran    into    the marsh.
One rolls one&lt;!--three sided--&gt; die for each word and selects the word from the appropriate column according to the number. Thus if one rolls 1 2 3 1 2 3 one is given, "The pig ran past the marsh." Each progression is essentially the same, there may be more or less choices for different slots, and the choices offered for each slot are slight [[variation (music)|variations]] rather than being entirely different.

== Alleged musikalisches Würfelspiel ==

The most well-known was published in 1792, by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s publisher [[Nikolaus Simrock]] in Berlin ([[Köchel catalogue|K.]] 294d or K. Anh. C 30.01). The game was attributed to Mozart, but this attribution has not been authenticated.&lt;ref&gt;Cope, David (1996). ''Experiments in Musical Intelligence'', p. 7. Madison, Wisconsin: A–R Editions, Inc. {{ISBN|978-0895793379}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The dice rolls randomly selected small sections of music, which would be patched together to create a musical piece. This game is capable of producing 11&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;45,949,729,863,572,161 different yet similar waltzes.&lt;ref&gt;Zbikowski (2002), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Some measures have only one possibility no matter what the roll of the dice (measure 8/16) while other measures have a different possibility for each roll (measure 1/16).&lt;ref&gt;Berkowitz (2010), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mozart's manuscript K. 516f, written in 1787, consisting of numerous two-[[bar (music)|bar]] fragments of music, appears to be some kind of game or system for constructing music out of two-bar fragments, but contains no instructions and there is no evidence that dice were involved.

The titles of the supposed Mozart compositions are:&lt;ref name="Algorithmic" /&gt;
*''{{Lang|de|Anleitung zum Componieren von Walzern so viele man will vermittelst zweier Würfel, ohne etwas von der Musik oder Composition zu verstehen}}'' (German for "Instructions for the composition of as many waltzes as one desires with two dice, without understanding anything about music or composition")
*''{{Lang|de|Anleitung zum Componieren von Polonaisen...}}'' (German for "Instructions for the composition of polonaises...")

[[Robert Xavier Rodríguez]] composed his ''Musical Dice Game'' for string orchestra based on K. 516f.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.schirmer.com/default.aspx?tabid=2420&amp;state_2874=2&amp;workid_2874=25473 Robert Xavier Rodríguez: Musical Dice Game]", Schirmer.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

The attribution of [[Joseph Haydn]]'s ''{{Lang|it|Gioco filarmonico o sia maniera facile per comporre un infinito numero de minuetti e trio anche senza sapere il contrappunto}}'' (Italian for "The game of harmony, or an easy method for composing an infinite number of minuet-trios, without any knowledge of counterpoint") has also not been authenticated.&lt;ref name="Algorithmic" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15112">'''Neural facilitation''', also known as '''paired pulse facilitation''' ('''PPF'''), is a phenomenon in [[neuroscience]] in which postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) ([[End-plate potential|EPPs]], [[Excitatory postsynaptic potential|EPSPs]] or [[Inhibitory postsynaptic potential|IPSPs]]) evoked by an impulse are increased when that impulse closely follows a prior impulse. PPF is thus a form of short-term [[synaptic plasticity]]. The mechanisms underlying neural facilitation are exclusively pre-synaptic; broadly speaking, PPF arises due to increased presynaptic {{chem|Ca|2+}} concentration leading to a greater release of neurotransmitter-containing [[synaptic vesicle]]s.&lt;ref name = Zucker&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zucker | first1=Robert S. | last2=Regehr| first2= Wade G. |title=Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity | journal=Annu.

==Mechanisms==

===Overview===

{{chem|Ca|2+}} plays a significant role in transmitting signals at [[chemical synapses]]. [[Voltage-dependent calcium channel|Voltage-gated {{chem|Ca|2+}} channels]] are located within the presynaptic terminal. When an [[action potential]] invades the presynaptic membrane, these channels open and {{chem|Ca|2+}} enters. A higher concentration of {{chem|Ca|2+}} enables [[synaptic vesicles]] to fuse to the presynaptic membrane and release their contents ([[neurotransmitters]]) into the [[synaptic cleft]] to ultimately contact receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. The amount of neurotransmitter released is correlated with the amount of {{chem|Ca|2+}} influx. Therefore, short-term facilitation (STF) results from a build up of {{chem|Ca|2+}} within the [[presynaptic terminal]] when action potentials propagate close together in time.&lt;ref name = Purves&gt;{{cite book | last = Purves | first = Dale | last2 = Augustine | first2 = George J. | last3 = Fitzpatrick | first3 = David | last4 = Hall | first4 = William C. | last5 = LaMantia | first5 = Anthony-Samuel | last6 = While | first6 = Leonard E. | title = Neuroscience | publisher = Sinauer | edition = 5th| year = 2012 | location = Sunderland, MA | isbn = 978-0-87893-695-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facilitation of excitatory post-synaptic current (EPSC) can be quantified as a ratio of subsequent EPSC strengths.  Each EPSC is triggered by pre-synaptic calcium concentrations and can be approximated by:

EPSC = k([{{chem|Ca|2+}}]&lt;sub&gt;presynaptic&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = k([{{chem|Ca|2+}}]&lt;sub&gt;rest&lt;/sub&gt; + [{{chem|Ca|2+}}]&lt;sub&gt;influx&lt;/sub&gt; + [{{chem|Ca|2+}}]&lt;sub&gt;residual&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;

Where k is a constant.

Facilitation = EPSC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; / EPSC&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = (1 + [{{chem|Ca|2+}}]&lt;sub&gt;residual&lt;/sub&gt; / [{{chem|Ca|2+}}]&lt;sub&gt;influx&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; - 1

===Experimental evidence===
Early experiments by Del Castillo &amp; Katz in 1954 and Dudel &amp; Kuffler in 1968 showed that facilitation was possible at the neuromuscular junction even if transmitter release does not occur, indicating that facilitation is an exclusively presynaptic phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Del Castillo | first1=J | last2=Katz | first2=B | title=Statistical factors involved in neuromuscular facilitation and depression | journal=J.

Physiol. | volume=155 | year=1961 | pages=530–542 | pmid=13724751 | pmc=1359873 | issue=3 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1961.sp006645 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Katz and Miledi proposed the '''residual {{chem|Ca|2+}} hypothesis.''' They attributed the increase in neurotransmitter release to residual or accumulated {{chem|Ca|2+}} ("active calcium") within the axon membrane that remains attached to the membrane's inner surface.&lt;ref name = katz&gt;{{Citation | last1=Katz | first1=B | last2=Miledi | first2=R | title=The role of calcium in neuromuscular facilitation | journal=J. Physiol. | volume=195 | year=1968 | pages=481–492 | pmid=4296699 | issue=2 | pmc=1351674 | doi=10.1113/jphysiol.1968.sp008469 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Katz and Miledi manipulated the {{chem|Ca|2+}} concentration within the presynaptic membrane to determine whether or not residual {{chem|Ca|2+}} remaining within the terminal after the first impulse caused an increase in neurotransmitter release following the second stimulus.

During the first nerve impulse, {{chem|Ca|2+}} concentration was either significantly below or nearing that of the second impulse. When {{chem|Ca|2+}} concentration was approaching that of the second impulse, facilitation was increased. In this first experiment, stimuli were presented in intervals of 100&amp;nbsp;ms between the first and second stimuli. An absolute [[refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] was reached when intervals were about 10&amp;nbsp;ms apart.

To examine facilitation during shorter intervals, Katz and Miledi directly applied brief [[depolarizing]] stimuli to nerve endings. When increasing the depolarizing stimulus from 1-2&amp;nbsp;ms, neurotransmitter release greatly increased due to accumulation of active {{chem|Ca|2+}}. Therefore, the degree of facilitation depends on the amount of active {{chem|Ca|2+}}, which is determined by the reduction in {{chem|Ca|2+}} conductance over time as well as the amount of  removed from axon terminals after the first stimulus. Facilitation is greatest when the impulses are closest together because {{chem|Ca|2+}} conductance would not return to baseline prior to the second stimulus. Therefore, both {{chem|Ca|2+}} conductance and accumulated {{chem|Ca|2+}}  would be greater for the second impulse when presented shortly after the first.

In the [[Calyx of Held]] synapse, short term facilitation (STF) has been shown to result from the binding of residual {{chem|Ca|2+}} to neuronal {{chem|Ca|2+}}  sensor 1 (NCS1). Conversely, STF has been shown to decrease when {{chem|Ca|2+}} chelators are added to the synapse (causing [[chelation]]) which reduce residual {{chem|Ca|2+}}. Therefore, "active {{chem|Ca|2+}}" plays a significant role in neural facilitation.&lt;ref name=Xu&gt;{{Citation | last1=Jianhua  | first1=Xu | last2=Liming | first2= He| last3=Ling-Gang | first3= Wu | title=Role of Ca2+ channels in short-term synaptic plasticity | journal= Current Opinion in Neurobiology| volume=17 | issue=3 | year=2007 | pages=352–9 | doi=10.1016/j.conb.2007.04.005 |pmid=17466513 |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959-4388(07)00059-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the synapse between [[Purkinje cells]], short-term facilitation has been shown to be entirely mediated by the facilitation of {{chem|Ca|2+}} currents through the [[voltage-dependent calcium channels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Díaz-Rojas|first1=Françoise|last2=Sakaba|first2=Takeshi|last3=Kawaguchi|first3=Shin-Ya|title=Ca(2+) current facilitation determines short-term facilitation at inhibitory synapses between cerebellar Purkinje cells.|journal=Journal of Physiology|date=Nov 15, 2015|volume=593|issue=22|pages=4889–904|doi=10.1113/JP270704|pmid=26337248|pmc=4650412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to other forms of short-term synaptic plasticity==

=== Augmentation and potentiation ===
Short-term synaptic enhancement is often differentiated into categories of '''facilitation''', '''[[synaptic augmentation|augmentation]]''', and '''[[post-tetanic potentiation|potentiation]]''' (also referred to as '''post-tetanic potentiation''' or '''PTP''').&lt;ref name = Zucker /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last = Thomson
 | first = Alex M.
 | title = Facilitation augmentation and potentiation at central synapses
 | journal = Trends in Neurosciences
 | volume = 23
 | issue = 7
 | pages = 305–312
 | year = 2000 |pmid=10856940  |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0166-2236(00)01580-0
 | doi=10.1016/s0166-2236(00)01580-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; These three processes are often differentiated by their time scales: facilitation usually lasts for tens of milliseconds, while augmentation acts on a time scale on the order of seconds and potentiation has a time course of tens of seconds to minutes. All three effects increase the probability of neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic membrane, but the underlying mechanism is different for each. Paired-pulse facilitation is caused by the presence of residual {{chem|Ca|2+}}, augmentation likely arises due to increased action of the presynaptic protein munc-13, and post-tetanic potentiation is mediated by presynaptic activation of protein kinases.&lt;ref name = Purves /&gt; The type of synaptic enhancement seen in a given cell is also related to variant dynamics of {{chem|Ca|2+}} removal, which is in turn dependent upon the type of stimuli; a single action potential leads to facilitation, while a short tetanus generally causes augmentation and a longer tetanus leads to potentiation.&lt;ref name = Zucker /&gt;

=== Short-term depression (STD) ===
Short-term depression (STD) operates in the opposite direction of facilitation, decreasing the amplitude of PSPs. STD occurs due to a decrease in the readily releasable pool of vesicles (RRP) as a result of frequent stimulation. The inactivation of presynaptic {{chem|Ca|2+}} channels after repeated action potentials also contributes to STD.&lt;ref name=Xu /&gt; Depression and facilitation interact to create short-term plastic changes within neurons, and this interaction is called the '''dual-process theory of plasticity'''. Basic models present these effects as additive, with the sum creating the net plastic change (facilitation - depression = net change). However, it has been shown that depression occurs earlier on in the stimulus-response pathway than facilitation, and therefore plays into the expression of facilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prescott|first=Steven|title=Interactions between Depression and Facilitation within Neural Networks: Updating the Dual-Process Theory of Plasticity|journal=Learning &amp; Memory|date=May 2012|volume=19|issue=5|pages=446–466|doi=10.1101/lm.5.6.446|doi-broken-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many synapses exhibit properties of both facilitation and depression. In general, however, synapses with low initial probability of vesicle release are more likely to exhibit facilitation, and synapses with high probability of initial vesicle release are more likely to exhibit depression.&lt;ref name = "SynapticComputation" /&gt;

==Relation to information transmission==

===Synaptic filtering===
Because the probability of vesicle release is activity-dependent, synapses can act as dynamic filters for information transmission.&lt;ref name="SynapticComputation" /&gt; Synapses with a low initial probability of vesicle release act as [[high-pass filters]]: because the release probability is low, a higher-frequency signal is needed to trigger release, and the synapse thus selectively responds to high-frequency signals. Likewise, synapses with high initial release probabilities serve as [[low-pass filters]], responding to lower-frequency signals. Synapses with an intermediate probability of release act as [[band-pass filters]] that selectively respond to a specific range of frequencies. These filtering characteristics may be affected by a variety of factors, including both PPD and PPF, as well as chemical [[neuromodulator]]s. In particular, because synapses with low release probabilities are more likely to experience facilitation than depression, high-pass filters are often converted to band-pass filters. Likewise, because synapses with high initial release probabilities are more likely to undergo depression than facilitation, it is common for low-pass filters to become band-pass filters, as well. Neuromodulators, meanwhile, may affect these short-term plasticities. In synapses with intermediate release probabilities, properties of the individual synapse will determine how the synapse changes in response to stimuli. These changes in filtration affect information transmission and encoding in response to repeated stimuli.&lt;ref name = "SynapticComputation" /&gt;

===Sound-source localization===
In humans, [[sound localization]] is primarily accomplished using information about how the intensity and timing of a sound vary between each ear. Neuronal computations involving these interaurual intensity differences (IIDs) and [[interaural time difference]]s (ITDs) are typically carried out in different pathways in the brain.&lt;ref name=macleod&gt;{{cite journal| last = MacLeod | first = KM | title= Short-term synaptic plasticity and intensity coding |journal= Hearing Research|year=2011|volume=279| issue = 1–2 |pages=13–21 | doi=10.1016/j.heares.2011.03.001| pmid = 21397676 | pmc = 3210195 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Short-term plasticity likely assists in differentiating between these two pathways: short-term facilitation dominates in intensity pathways, while short-term depression dominates in temporal pathways. These different types of short-term plasticity allow for different kinds of information filtration, thus contributing to the division of the two kinds of information into distinct processing streams.

The filtering capabilities of short-term plasticity may also assist with encoding information related to amplitude modulation.&lt;ref name = macleod /&gt; Short-term depression can dynamically adjust the gain on high-frequency inputs, and may thus allow for an expanded high-frequency range for AM. A mixture of facilitation and depression may also assist in AM coding by leading to rate filtering.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20589">[[Wide area network|Online communication]] between [[home]] and [[school]] is the use of [[digital telecommunication]] to convey information and ideas between [[teacher]]s, [[student]]s, [[Parent-teacher conference|parent]]s, and school [[Academic administration|administrators]].  As the use of [[e-mail]] and the [[Internet access|internet]] becomes even more widespread, these tools become more valuable and useful in education for the purposes of increasing [[learning]] for students, and [[facilitation (business)|facilitating]] [[conversation]]s between students, parents, and schools.&lt;ref name=sup7/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup8/&gt;

== Overview ==

Online communication emphasizes 21st century skills, [[self-directed learning]], [[self-advocacy]], global awareness, and thinking skills for learners.&lt;ref name="Watson, J. 2009"&gt;Watson, J., Gemin, B., &amp; International Association for K-12 Online, L. (2009). Management and Operations of Online Programs: Ensuring Quality and Accountability. Promising Practices in Online Learning. International Association for K-12 Online Learning&lt;/ref&gt;  Utilizing online communication methods, schools help students develop [[Netiquette]], and technical and [[computer skills]].&lt;ref name="Watson, J. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup3/&gt;  In addition, teachers can provide parents with frequent information about school programs and their children's progress through automated e-mails, official [[website]]s and [[learning management system]]s.&lt;ref name=sup8/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup11/&gt; This communication can be achieved either [[synchronization|synchronously]] or [[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]]ly, providing greater time flexibility.&lt;ref name=sup11/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup9/&gt;

With online communication, learning may occur outside traditional school hours as students participate in collaborative activities, like reading and responding to [[Peer group|peer]] posts in online forums, [[experiment]]s, group [[project]]s, research papers, and current events assignments.&lt;ref name=sup4/&gt;   In addition, online communication can connect a wide range of individuals and increase the diversity of [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]s that learners are exposed to.&lt;ref name="Watson, J. 2009"/&gt;

However, not all parents, students, or teachers have access to unlimited [[internet access]] or the digital technology necessary to participate in online communication, and it may be costly to initially implement the [[information technology]], [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]], and [[software]].&lt;ref name=sup1/&gt;  Furthermore, schools must provide [[Student orientation|orientation]] to the online environments and [[technical support]] to ensure that all potential [[User (telecommunications)|user]]s are ready to participate.&lt;ref name=sup3/&gt;  Teachers will also need to spend additional time online as active participants in the communication activities (e.g. act as the [[Forum moderator#Moderators|moderator]]s of discussions).&lt;ref name="Watson, J. 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup4/&gt;  In addition, the immediacy of online communication can lead to students and parents' unreasonable expectations that teachers be 'on-call' at all times.&lt;ref name=sup1&gt;Southern Regional Education Board (2003). Essential Principles of High-Quality Online Teaching: Guidelines for Evaluating K-12 Online Teachers.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online communication between parents and school ==

Online communication between parents and schools are online methods that serve as a [[Computing platform|platform]] for parents and teachers to exchange ideas.  For teachers and administrators, online communication makes it easier to reach the parents and build the partnerships with parents.Online communication allows parents to receive real-time information about their child’s performance and activities at school, and flexible opportunities to ask questions and provide information to teachers and school administrators.

In this recent time of technology and modern educational sector, there are many ways to get instant connectivity with your university or college teachers. In the online education process the communication is playing a major role for both teachers and students. There are many online universities and colleges who offer their education services online and they create a good communication path where all the student and the teacher took participation to discuss with every other and this will also help to get problem resolve very early. For  those professional employees who stop their studies and start doing work. With the online education colleges and universities now they have an opportunity to get complete their education and complete their academic profile by having a higher degree on their resume. If you have a years of work experience in any field, but your employer doesn’t recognize you just because of your degree then there is a good news for you that the online universities also giving you the chance for apply your degree on the basis of your work experience.

=== Benefits ===

Creating [[Mode (literature)|mode]]s for online communication can increase parent participation in their children's education, which in turn increases students’ interest in their learning.  Online communication increases parents’ understanding of classroom [[Procedure (term)|procedures]], [[Philosophy|philosophies]] and [[Policy|policies]].  Parents then feel more involved in their child's school and more connected to the teacher.  In general, online communication improves parents’ attitudes toward conferencing with teachers and administrators.&lt;ref name=sup13/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup15/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup17/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup23/&gt;

This style of communication allows for more asynchronous communication and greater flexibility.  With online communication, parents can initiate conversations and express concerns to teachers and school officials easily.  In addition, informal communication through online [[Online chat|chat]]ting or [[Internet forum|forum]]s can reduce parents’ [[anxiety]] of meeting face-to-face with teachers and/or school officials.  When possible, online communication can also offer comfort through anonymity.&lt;ref name=sup13/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup15/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup17/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup23/&gt;

=== Challenges ===

Though most of the time, teachers and parents want to establish communication, there are some challenges that teacher and parents need to face together.  The most common challenges involve parent’s ability to use the [[software]], their access to consistent [[internet access]] and [[language barrier]]s.  There may be financial costs incurred by the school, if they provide [[training]] or [[translation]] to parents in order to make online communication more inclusive.&lt;ref name=sup13/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup15/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup23/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup24/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup24/&gt;

== Online communication between students and teachers ==

Online communication between teachers and students facilitates the exchange of ideas and [[e-learning]]. Online communication allows students to access learning materials beyond school hours and develop relationships with peers and teachers.&lt;ref name=sup31/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup32/&gt;

=== Benefits ===

The creation of [[Web 2.0]] and [[social networks]] means that knowledge is now [[collective]] and readily available online for students to access and contribute to.&lt;ref name=sup31/&gt; Promoting online communication between teachers and students creates opportunities for students to receive feedback and assistance from teachers and peers outside the regular school day and classroom.  Student can e-mail or post questions, add their opinions to peer-discussions, and check official websites for pertinent information.

Through online learning communities of teachers and peers, students can build relationships with other users and establish a sense of both [[connectedness]] and belonging.  Some students, who are less likely to participate in face-to discussions, are more likely to participate in [[online discussion]]s and activities.  This online communication enhances the strength of the relationships between students and both their peers and teachers.

=== Challenges ===

Student can demonstrate [[antipathy]] towards online communication or peer [[interdependency]] in internet forums.  In order to be productive, online communication between students and teachers requires [[trust (social sciences)|trust]], [[interactivity]], common expectations and shared goals.  Some students expect teachers to be on-call 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, placing unreasonable expectations upon teachers.&lt;ref name=sup28/&gt; In addition, most students spend participate in online communication from home, which means that parent's help is often required, but may not be available.  Finally, students may lack the technical skills or access to the technology necessary to involve themselves in online communication.

=== Role of teachers ===

Teachers have great responsibility in the establishment of online communication and [[communities]] with students, because of their leadership position.  Several of their in-class characteristics must extend into the online environment, such as their ability to guide student behavior and learning.  With online communication, teachers must model and demonstrate appropriate Netiquette throughout their persistent involvement.  Teachers should also encourage their classes to evolve into [[learning communities]] in which group processes have the power to influence the behavior of individuals.&lt;ref name=sup31/&gt; These online environments should foster a sense of [[openness]], friendliness, and [[Trust (social sciences)|trust]], so that [[problem solving]] becomes a group function.&lt;ref name=sup31/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup34/&gt;

=== Examples ===

Teachers and students can e-mail questions and answers to each other about course content and assignments.  Schools and teachers can maintain official websites with important information about events, assignments, and resources that students can utilize outside class.&lt;ref name=sup25/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup33/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup45/&gt;

Both students and teachers can post messages in online forums as a part of homework assignments.  In this way they can present different points of view that they don't have any chance to present in the classroom.

Online [[study group]]s  allow students to maintain relationships with their peers from a distance.  These study groups can be created within a classroom’s [[Social-networking sites|social networking site]], allowing users to connect with each other directly, beyond typical chat rooms and forums.

Teachers can develop [[virtual tour]]s, [[virtual education]], and virtual learning environment for their students in [[Multi-User Virtual Environment|multi-user virtual environment]]s (MUVE).

== Technology and tools ==

The most widely used online communication tool is e-mail between teachers, which provides opportunities for asynchronous communication, instantaneous distribution to a mass audience, mobile access, and file exchange.&lt;ref name=sup39/&gt;&lt;ref name=sup40/&gt;  Teacher-created websites provide online access to administrative information, calendars, [[Hyperlink|link]]s, [[blog]]s, etc.  Internet forums allow learners and teachers to articulate ideas, give and receive feedback, reflect on the perspectives of others, and receive clarification of concepts.&lt;ref name=sup37/&gt;  [[List of social networking websites|social networking site]]s are used for focused and open communication between users.  Blogs allow individuals to express their ideas in greater detail and with [[multimedia]].

===Course Management Systems (CMS)===
{{See also|Learning management system|Virtual learning environment}}

Various course management systems are designed specifically for facilitating online communication in education.  Effective course management software tends to include more information, widgets, functions, and customization options than teacher-created websites.

Most course management systems include:
* class information: calendar, [[syllabus]], details of prerequisites, assessment information, and a [[FAQ]]
* a notice board with up-to-date course information
* learning materials: course content, copies of visual aids, reading materials and links to community resources
* assessment opportunities: [[self-assessment]], [[Self- and Peer-Assessment|peer-assessment]], and formal assessment
* communication support: e-mail, [[threaded discussion]]s, and a chat room
* differentiated access rights for teachers, administrators, and students
* document authoring tools
* administrative tools:  student [[Tracking (education)|tracking]] capabilities, [[statistics]], and [[report]]s

Notable CMS Software include:
&lt;!--Entries should have a Wikipedia article, based on multiple independent sources.--&gt;
* [[Chamilo]]
* [[Claroline]]
* [[eFront]]
* [[ILIAS]]
* [[JoomlaLMS]] (a LMS based on Joomla platform)
* [[LAMS]] (Learning Activity Management System)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22050">In [[markup language]]s and the [[digital humanities]], '''overlap''' occurs when a document has two or more structures that interact in a non-[[hierarchical]] manner.
A document with overlapping markup cannot be represented as a [[tree (graph)|tree]].
This is also known as '''concurrent markup'''.
Overlap happens, for instance, in [[poetry]], where there may be a [[meter (poetry)|metrical]] structure of [[foot (prosody)|feet]] and lines; a linguistic structure of sentences and quotations; and a physical structure of volumes and pages and editorial annotations.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem types}}

== History ==

[[File:Frankenstein.1831.inside-cover.jpg|thumb|right|The structural differences between multiple editions of ''[[Frankenstein]]'' have been analysed with overlapping techniques.{{sfn|Piez|2014}}]]

The problem of non-hierarchical structures in documents has been recognised since 1988; resolving this problem against the dominant paradigm of text as a single hierarchy (an ''ordered hierarchy of content objects'' or ''OHCO'') was initially thought to be merely a technical issue, but has, in fact, proven much more difficult.{{sfn|Renear|Mylonas|Durand|1993}}
In 2008, [[Jeni Tennison]] identified markup overlap as "the main remaining problem area for markup technologists".{{sfn|Tennison|2008}}

== Properties and types ==

A distinction exists between schemes that allow non-contiguous overlap, and those that allow only contiguous overlap. Often, 'markup overlap' strictly means the latter.
Contiguous overlap can always be represented as a linear document with milestones (typically co-indexed start- and end-markers), without the need for fragmenting a (logical) component into multiple physical one. Non-contiguous overlap may require document fragmentation. Another distinction in overlapping markup schemes is whether elements can overlap with other elements of the same kind (''self-overlap'').{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem types}}

A scheme may have a ''privileged'' hierarchy.
Some [[XML]]-based schemes, for example, represent one hierarchy directly in the XML document tree, and represent other, overlapping, structures by another means;
these are said to be ''non-privileged''.

== Approaches and implementations ==

{{harvtxt|DeRose|2004|loc=Evaluation criteria}} identifies several criteria for judging solutions to the overlap problem: readability and maintainability, tool support and compatibility with XML, possible validation schemes, and ease of processing.

[[Tag soup]] is, strictly speaking, not overlapping markup—it is malformed [[HTML]], which is a non-overlapping language, and may be ill-defined.
Some [[web browsers]] attempted to represent overlapping start and end tags with non-hierarchical [[Document Object Model]]s (DOM), but this was not standardised across all browsers and was incompatible with the innately hierarchical nature of the DOM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ln.hixie.ch/?count=1&amp;start=1037910467 | title =  Tag Soup: How UAs handle &amp;lt;x&gt; &amp;lt;y&gt; &amp;lt;/x&gt; &amp;lt;/y&gt; | author = [[Ian Hickson]] | date = 2002-11-21 | accessdate = 2017-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://hsivonen.fi/soup-dom/ | title = Tag Soup: How Mac IE 5 and Safari handle &amp;lt;x&gt; &amp;lt;y&gt; &amp;lt;/x&gt; &amp;lt;/y&gt; | author = Henri Sivonen | date = 2003-08-16 | accessdate = 2017-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[HTML5]] defines how processors should deal with such mis-nested markup in the HTML syntax and turn it into a single hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = HTML5 (Proposed Recommendation) § 8.2.8 An introduction to error handling and strange cases in the parser | author = [[W3 Consortium]] | date = 16 September 2014 | url = http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#an-introduction-to-error-handling-and-strange-cases-in-the-parser | accessdate = 2014-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
With [[XHTML]] and [[SGML]]-based HTML, however, mis-nested markup is a strict error and makes processing by standards-compliant systems impossible.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.1. Non-SGML Notations}}
The HTML standard defines a [[paragraph]] concept which can cause overlap with other elements and can be discontiguous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = HTML Standard § 3.2.5.4 Paragraphs | url = https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#paragraphs | accessdate = 2017-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SGML]], which early versions of HTML were based on, has a feature called CONCUR that allows multiple independent hierarchies to co-exist without privileging any.
[[Document type definition|DTD]] validation is only defined for each individual hierarchy with CONCUR. Validation across hierarchies is not defined by the standard. CONCUR could not support self-overlap, and it interacted poorly with some of SGML's abbreviatory features.
This feature was poorly supported by tools and saw very little actual use;
using CONCUR to represent document overlap was not a recommended use case, according to a commentary by the standard's editor.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.2. CONCUR}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|log=SGML CONCUR}}

=== Within hierarchical languages ===

There are several approaches to representing overlap in a non-overlapping language.{{sfn|Di Iorio|Peroni|Vitali|2009}}
The [[Text Encoding Initiative]], as an XML-based markup scheme, cannot directly represent overlapping markup.
All four of the below approaches are suggested.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative}}
The [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] is another XML-based scheme, designed to mark up the [[Bible]].
It uses empty milestone elements to encode non-privileged components.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = OSIS Users Manual (OSIS Schema 2.1.1) | first = Patrick | last = Durusau | url = http://img.forministry.com/7/7B/7BB51FB8-84B3-4FF3-939ED473FA90A632/DOC/OSIS2_1UserManual_06March2006_-_with_O%27Donnell_edits.PDF | date = 2006 | accessdate = 2014-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To illustrate these approaches, marking up the sentences and lines of a fragment of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] will be used as a running example. Where there is a privileged hierarchy, the lines will be used.

==== Multiple documents ====
''Multiple documents'', which provide different internally consistent hierarchies. The advantage of this approach is that each document is simple and can be processed with existing tools, but requires maintenance of redundant content and it can be difficult to cross-reference between different views.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=20.1 Multiple Encodings of the Same Information}} With multiple documents, the overlap can be analysed with [[data comparison]] and [[delta encoding]] techniques, and, in an XML context, specific XML tree differencing algorithms are available.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009}}{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016}}

Example, with lines marked up:
&lt;source lang=xml&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,&lt;/line&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;Who prays continually for Richmond's good.&lt;/line&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;So much for that.—The silent hours steal on,&lt;/line&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;And flaky darkness breaks within the east.&lt;/line&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

With sentences marked up:
&lt;source lang=xml&gt;
  &lt;sentence&gt;I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,
  Who prays continually for Richmond's good.&lt;/sentence&gt;
  &lt;sentence&gt;So much for that.&lt;/sentence&gt;&lt;sentence&gt;—The silent hours steal on,
  And flaky darkness breaks within the east.&lt;/sentence&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Milestones ====
''Milestones'' are empty elements that mark the beginning and end of a component. These can be used to embed a non-privileged structure within a hierarchical language, and can only represent contiguous overlap. Existing tools will also not understand the meaning of the milestone elements and so cannot easily process or validate the non-privileged structure.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=20.2 Boundary Marking with Empty Elements}}{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.4. Milestones}} The markup being near the content is an advantage for maintainability and readability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=TEI-style milestones}} [[CLIX (markup)|CLIX]] {{harv|DeRose|2004}} is an example of such an approach.

Example:
&lt;source lang=xml&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;&lt;sentence-start /&gt;I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,&lt;/line&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;Who prays continually for Richmond's good.&lt;sentence-end /&gt;&lt;/line&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;&lt;sentence-start /&gt;So much for that.&lt;sentence-end /&gt;&lt;sentence-start /&gt;—The silent hours steal on,&lt;/line&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;And flaky darkness breaks within the east.&lt;sentence-end /&gt;&lt;/line&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Punctuation]] and [[Space (punctuation)|inter-word spaces]] have been identified as a type of milestone-style 'crypto-overlap' or 'pseudo-markup', as the boundaries of words, clauses, sentences and the like do not necessarily align with the formal markup boundaries hierarchically.{{sfn|Birnbaum|Thorsen|2015}}{{sfn|Haentjens Dekker|Birnbaum|2017}}

==== Joins ====
''Joins'' are pointers within a privileged hierarchy to other components of the privileged hierarchy, which may be used to reconstruct a non-privileged component akin to following a [[linked list]]. A single non-privileged element is ''segmented'' into several ''partial'' elements within the privileged hierarchy; the partial elements themselves do not represent a single unit in the non-privileged hierarchy, which can be misleading and make processing difficult.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=20.3 Fragmentation and Reconstitution of Virtual Elements}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Segmentation}} While this approach can support some discontiguous structures, it is not able to re-order elements.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.5. Fragmentation}} A slightly different approach can, however, express re-ordering by expressing the join away from the content, at the cost of directness and maintainability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Joins}}

Example:
&lt;source lang=xml&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;&lt;sentence id="a"&gt;I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,&lt;/sentence&gt;&lt;/line&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;&lt;sentence continues="a"&gt;Who prays continually for Richmond's good.&lt;/sentence&gt;&lt;/line&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;&lt;sentence id="b"&gt;So much for that.&lt;/sentence&gt;&lt;sentence id="c"&gt;—The silent hours steal on,&lt;/sentence&gt;&lt;/line&gt;
  &lt;line&gt;&lt;sentence continues="c"&gt;And flaky darkness breaks within the east.&lt;/sentence&gt;&lt;/line&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Stand-off markup ====
''Stand-off markup'' is similar to using joins, except that there is no privileged hierarchy: each part of the document is given a label (or might be referred to by an offset), and the document is constructed by pointing to the content from markup that 'stands off' from the content (possibly in an entirely different file), and might contain no content itself. Validation of stand-off markup is very challenging.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.6. Standoff Markup}} In addition, maintenance is a problem.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|log=Standoff markup}}

Example:
&lt;source lang=xml&gt;
  &lt;span id="a"&gt;I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span id="b"&gt;Who prays continually for Richmond's good.&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span id="c"&gt;So much for that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id="d"&gt;—The silent hours steal on,&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span id="e"&gt;And flaky darkness breaks within the east.&lt;/span&gt;
  ...
  &lt;line contents="a" /&gt;
  &lt;line contents="b" /&gt;
  &lt;line contents="c d" /&gt;
  &lt;line contents="e" /&gt;
  &lt;sentence contents="a b" /&gt;
  &lt;sentence contents="c" /&gt;
  &lt;sentence contents="d e" /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== New languages ===

Another approach is to design an entirely new markup language.
These forego the tool support in existing languages for a less complicated semantic model and more convenient syntax.

* [[LMNL]] is a non-hierarchical markup language first described in 2002 by [[Jeni Tennison]] and [[Wendell Piez]], annotating ranges of a document with properties and allowing self-overlap. CLIX, which originally stood for 'Canonical LMNL In XML', provides a method for representing any LMNL document in a milestone-style XML document.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=CLIX and LMNL}} It also has another XML serialisation, xLMNL.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite conference | first = Wendell | last = Piez | date = August 2012 | title = Luminescent: parsing LMNL by XSLT upconversion | conference = Balisage: The Markup Conference 2012 | location = Montréal | doi = 10.4242/BalisageVol8.Piez01 | url = http://www.balisage.net/Proceedings/vol8/html/Piez01/BalisageVol8-Piez01.html | accessdate = 2014-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[MECS]] was developed by the [[University of Bergen]]'s [[Wittgenstein Archive]]. However, it had several problems: it allowed some non-sensical documents of overlapping elements, it could not support self-overlap, and it did not have the capacity to define a DTD-like grammar.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.7. MECS}} The theory of [[General Ordered-Descendant Directed Acyclic Graph]]s (GODDAGs), while not strictly a markup language itself, is a general data model for non-hierarchical markup. ''Restricted GODDAGs'' were designed specifically to match the semantics of MECS; general GODDAGs may be non-contiguous and need a more powerful language.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000}} [[TexMECS]] is a successor to MECS, which has a formal grammar and is designed to represent every GODDAG and nothing that is not a GODDAG.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = TexMECS: An experimental markup meta-language for complex documents | first1 = Claus | last1 = Huitfeldt | first2 = C M | last2 = Sperberg-McQuen | url = http://mlcd.blackmesatech.com/mlcd/2003/Papers/texmecs.html | date = 2003 | accessdate = 2014-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[XCONCUR]] (previously MuLaX) is a melding-together of XML and SGML's CONCUR, and also contains a validation language, XCONCUR-CL, and a [[Simple API for XML|SAX]]-like API.{{sfn|Hilbert|Schonefeld|Witt|2005}}{{sfn|Witt|Schonefeld|Rehm|Khoo|2007}}{{sfn|Schonefeld|2008}}
* Marinelli, Vitali and Zacchiroli provide algorithms to convert between restricted GODDAGs, ECLIX, LMNL, parallel documents in XML, contiguous stand-off markup and TexMECS.{{sfn|Marinelli|Vitali|Zacchiroli|2008}}

=== Graph-based formalisms ===

Rather than grounding markup information in a tree, standoff XML employs a data model based on directed graphs.{{sfn|Ide|Suderman|2007}}
As an alternative to traditional markup, such graph-based data models can be represented with formalisms originally developed for generalised directed [[multigraph]]s, most notably the [[Resource Description Framework|Resource Description Framework (RDF)]].{{sfn|Cassidy|2010|log=cassidy}}{{sfn|Chiarcos|2012|log=POWLA}}
EARMARK is an early [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]/[[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] representation that encompasses GODDAGs.{{sfn|Di Iorio|Peroni|Vitali|2009}}

RDF provides different linearizations, including an XML format that can be modeled to mirror conventional standoff XML, and a linearization that lets RDF be expressed in XML attributes ([[RDFa]]). But while it is semantically equivalent to standoff XML, it does not require special-purpose technology for storing, parsing and querying. Multiple interlinked RDF files representing a document or a corpus may constitute an example of [[Linguistic Linked Open Data]].

{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2015}}
'''Participatory budgeting''' (PB) is a process of democratic [[deliberation]] and decision-making, in which ordinary people decide how to allocate part of a [[municipal]] or public [[budget]]. Participatory budgeting allows [[citizen]]s to identify, discuss, and prioritize public spending projects, and gives them the power to make real decisions about how money is spent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://theconversation.com/the-citizen-budgets-of-africa-make-governments-more-transparent-58275|first=Usman W.|last=Chohan|title=The 'citizen budgets' of Africa make governments more transparent| website=The Conversation|date=2016-04-20|access-date=2016-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PB processes are typically designed to involve those left out of traditional methods of public engagement, such as low-income residents, non-citizens, and youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/who-we-are/mission-approach/|title=Mission &amp; Approach| website=Participatory Budgeting Project|date=2012-09-20|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive case study of eight municipalities in Brazil analyzing the successes and failures of participatory budgeting has suggested that it often results in more equitable public spending, greater government [[Transparency (humanities)|transparency]] and accountability, increased levels of [[public participation]] (especially by marginalized or poorer residents), and democratic and citizenship learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.psupress.org/books/titles/978-0-271-03252-8.html |title= Participatory Budgeting in Brazil |work= PSUpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frameworks of PB differentiate variously throughout the globe in terms of scale, procedure, and objective. PB, in its conception, is often contextualized to suit a region's particular conditions and needs. Thus, the magnitudes of PB vary depending on whether it is carried out at a municipal, regional, or provincial level. In many cases, PB has been legally enforced and regulated; however, some are internally arranged and promoted. Since the original invention in Porto Alegre, Brazil, in 1988, PB has manifested itself in a myriad of designs, with variations in methodology, form, and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porto de Oliveira|first1=Osmany|title=Internatioanl Policy Diffusion and Participatory Budgeting: Ambassadors of Participation, International Institutional and Transnational Networks|date=January 10, 2017|publisher=Springer Nature|location=Cham, Switzerland|isbn=978-3-319-43337-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; PB stands as one of several democratic innovations such as [[Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform (British Columbia)|British Columbia's Citizens' Assembly]], encompassing the ideals of a [[participatory democracy]].&lt;ref name="Palgrave Macmillan"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Röcke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9 |doi=10.1057/9781137326669}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, PB has been implemented in nearly 1,500 municipalities and institutions around the world.&lt;ref name="Palgrave Macmillan"/&gt;

==Procedure==
Most broadly, all participatory budgeting schemes allow citizens to deliberate with the goal of creating either a concrete financial plan (a budget), or a recommendation to elected representatives. In the Porto Alegre model, the structure of the scheme gives subjurisdictions (neighborhoods) authority over the larger political jurisdiction (the city) of which they are part. Neighborhood budget committees, for example, have authority to determine the citywide budget, not just the allocation of resources for their particular neighborhood. There is, therefore, a need for mediating institutions to facilitate the aggregation of budget preferences expressed by subjurisdictions.

According to the World Bank Group, certain factors are needed for PB to be adopted: "[...]strong mayoral support, a civil society willing and able to contribute to ongoing policy debates, a generally supportive political environment that insulates participatory budgeting from legislators' attacks, and financial resources to fund the projects selected by citizens."&lt;ref name="Shah2007p24"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|page=24|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are generally two approaches through which PB formulates: top-down versus bottom-up. The adoption of PB has been required by the federal government in nations such as Peru, while there are cases where local governments initiated PB independent from the national agenda such as Porto Alegre. With the bottom-up approach, NGO's and local organizations have played crucial roles in mobilizing and informing the community members.&lt;ref name="Shah2007p24" /&gt;

PB processes do not adhere to strict rules, but they generally share several basic steps:&lt;ref name="Shah2007p26"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|page=26|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The municipality is divided geographically into multiple districts.
* Representatives of the divided districts are either elected or volunteered to work with government officials in a PB committee.
* The committees are established with regularly scheduled meetings under a specific timeline to deliberate. 
* Proposals, initiated by the citizens, are dealt under different branches of public budget such as recreation, infrastructure, transportation, etc.
* Participants publicly deliberate with the committee to finalize the projects to be voted on.
* The drafted budget is shared to the public and put for a vote. 
* The municipal government implements the top proposals.
* The cycle is repeated on an annual basis.

== History ==
[[File:Esquina democrática.jpg|thumb|right|Participatory budgeting has been practiced in [[Porto Alegre]] since 1989.]]

Participatory Budgeting was first developed in the 1980s by the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Brazilian Workers' Party]], drawing on the party's stated belief that electoral success is not an end in itself but a spring board for developing radical, participatory forms of democracy. While there were several early experiments (including the public budgeting practices of the [[Brazilian Democratic Movement]] in municipalities such as [[Pelotas]] &lt;ref name="Shah2007p92"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Participatory Budgeting|last=Shah|first=Anwar|publisher=The World Bank|year=2007|isbn=978-0-8213-6923-4|doi=10.1596/978-0-8213-6923-4|pages=92|url=http://hdrnet.org/498/1/br_27_56.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the first full participatory budgeting process was implemented in 1989, in the city of [[Porto Alegre|Porto Alegre, Brazil]], a capital city of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, and a busy industrial, financial, and service center, at that time with a population of 1.2 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Making a People's Budget in Porto Alegre. NACLA Report On The Americas|last=Wainwright|first=H.|publisher=|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=36(5), 37–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial success of PB in Porto Alegre soon made it attractive to other municipalities. By 2001, more than 100 cities in Brazil had implemented PB, while in 2015, thousands of variations have been implemented in the Americas, Africa, Asia and Europe.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title =How Participatory Budgeting Travels the Globe|issue = 2|url = http://www.publicdeliberation.net/jpd/vol8/iss2/art8/|journal = Journal of Public Deliberation|volume = 8|accessdate = 2015-11-17|date = 2012-12-30|last1 = Ganuza|first1 = Ernesto|last2 = Baiocchi|first2 = Gianpaolo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Porto Alegre===

In its [[Constitution of Brazil#Title 1|first Title]], the [[History of the Constitution of Brazil#Citizen Constitution .281988 .E2.80.93 present.29|1988 Constitution of Brazil]] states that "All power originates from the people, who exercise it by the means of elected representatives or directly, according to the terms of this Constitution." The authoring of the Constitution was a reaction to the previous twenty years of [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]], and the new Constitution sought to secure individual liberty while also decentralizing and democratizing ruling power, in the hope that authoritarian dictatorship would not reemerge.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://pas.sagepub.com/content/26/4/511.short|title = From Clientelism to Cooperation: Local Government, Participatory Policy, and Civic Organizing in Porto Alegre, Brazil|last = Abers|first = Jessica|date = 1998|journal = Politics &amp; Society|doi = 10.1177/0032329298026004004|pmid = |access-date = 15 November 2015|pages = 511–537|volume=26|issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil's contemporary [[political economy]] is an outgrowth of the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese empire's]] patrimonial capitalism, where "power was not exercised according to rules, but was structured through personal relationships".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Participatory Budgeting in Porto Alegre: Social Innovation and the Dialectical Relationship of State and Civil Society|url = http://usj.sagepub.com/content/42/11/2023|journal = Urban Studies|date = 2005-10-01|issn = 0042-0980|pages = 2023–2036|volume = 42|issue = 11|doi = 10.1080/00420980500279828|first = Andreas|last = Novy|first2 = Bernhard|last2 = Leubolt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the [[Athenian democracy|Athenian ideal of democracy]], in which all citizens participate directly and decide policy collectively, Brazil's government is structured as a [[republic]] with [[Representative democracy|elected representatives]]. This institutional arrangement has created a separation between the state and [[civil society]], which has opened the doors for [[clientelism]]. Because the law-making process occurs behind closed doors, elected officials and bureaucrats can access state resources in ways that benefit certain 'clients', typically those of extraordinary social or economic relevance. The influential clients receive policy favors, and repay elected officials with votes from the groups they influence. For example, a neighborhood leader represents the views of shop owners to the local party boss, asking for laws to increase foot traffic on commercial streets. In exchange, the neighborhood leader mobilizes shop owners to vote for the political party responsible for the policy. Because this patronage operates on the basis of individual ties between patron and clients, true decision-making power is limited to a small network of party bosses and influential citizens rather than the broader public.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Participatory Budgeting in Porto Alegre: Toward a Redistributive Democracy|url = http://pas.sagepub.com/content/26/4/461|journal = Politics &amp; Society|date = 1998-12-01|issn = 0032-3292|pages = 461–510|volume = 26|issue = 4|doi = 10.1177/0032329298026004003|first = BOAVENTURA de SOUSA|last = Santos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, [[Olívio Dutra]] won the mayor's seat in Porto Alegre. In an attempt to encourage popular participation in government and redirect government resources towards the poor, Dutra institutionalized the PT's organizational structure on a citywide level. The result is one example of what we now know as Participatory Budgeting.

=== Outcomes ===
A [[World Bank]] paper suggests that participatory budgeting has led to direct improvements in facilities in Porto Alegre. For example, [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] and water connections increased from 75% of households in 1988 to 98% in 1997. The number of [[school]]s quadrupled since 1986.{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003|p=2}}

The high number of participants, after more than a decade, suggests that participatory budgeting encourages increasing citizen involvement, according to the paper. Also, Porto Alegre's health and education budget increased from 13% (1985) to almost 40% (1996), and the share of the participatory budget in the total budget increased from 17% (1992) to 21% (1999).{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003|p=3}} In a paper that updated the World Bank's methodology, expanding statistical scope and analyzing Brazil's 253 largest municipalities that use participatory budgeting, researchers found that participatory budgeting reallocates spending towards health and sanitation. Health and sanitation benefits accumulated the longer participatory budgeting was used in a municipality. Participatory budgeting does not merely allow citizens to shift funding priorities in the short-term – it can yield sustained institutional and political change in the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://cps.sagepub.com/content/47/10/1442.full?keytype=ref&amp;siteid=spcps&amp;ijkey=qPmuzabskSFkQ |title= Improving Social Well-Being Through New Democratic Institutions |accessdate=September 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper concludes that participatory budgeting can lead to improved conditions for the [[Poverty|poor]]. Although it cannot overcome wider problems such as [[unemployment]], it leads to "noticeable improvement in the accessibility and quality of various [[public welfare]] amenities".{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003|p=1}}

Based on Porto Alegre more than 140 (about 2.5%) of the 5,571 municipalities in Brazil have adopted participatory budgeting.{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003}}{{Page needed |date=October 2015}}

==Implementation &amp; Policy Diffusion==
As of 2015, over 1,500 instances of PB have been implemented across the five continents.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; While the democratic spirit of PB remains the same throughout the world, institutional variations abound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Budgets for the People|url = https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2015-03-11/budgets-people|journal = Foreign Affairs|accessdate = 2015-11-17|date = 2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the Dominican Republic, Bolivia, Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Peru have implemented participatory budgeting in all local governments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.watsonblogs.org/participatorybudgeting/historypb.html |title=History|work= The Participatory Budgeting Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of towns and cities in [[Portugal]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], and [[Spain]] have also initiated participatory budgeting processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | language = de | title = Volumen zwei: Endbericht Bürgerhaushalt Europa 5 |trans-title = Volume two | format = PDF | place = [[Germany|DE]] | publisher = Bürgerhaushalt Europa | url = http://www.buergerhaushalt-europa.de/documents/Volumen_zwei_Endbericht_Buergerhaushalt_Europa5.pdf}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]], participatory budgeting has been implemented with public housing, neighbourhood groups, and a public schools, in the cities of [[Toronto]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontohousing.ca/participatory_budgeting|title= Participatory Budgeting – Working together, making a difference | publisher = Toronto Community Housing}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guelph]], [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = PB Hamilton, Ontario | url = http://pbhamont.ca/ | place = [[Canada|CA]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[West Vancouver]]. Since its emergence in Porto Alegre, participatory budgeting has spread to hundreds of [[Latin America]]n cities, and dozens of cities in [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[North America]]. In some cities, participatory budgeting has been applied for school, university, and public housing budgets. In France, the Region [[Poitou-Charentes]] is notable for launching participatory budgeting in its secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Poitou-Charentes' participatory budget in the high schools | type = wiki | contribution-url = http://www.participedia.net/wiki/Poitou-Charentes%27_participatory_budget_in_the_highschools | title = Participedia}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  These international approaches differ significantly, and they are shaped as much by their local contexts as by the Porto Alegre model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Participatory budgeting | publisher = CFE | url = http://www.cfe.org.uk/uploaded/files/Participatory%20Budgeting.pdf | format = PDF | place = [[United Kingdom|UK]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
Participatory budgeting in [[Porto Alegre]] occurs annually, starting with a series of neighborhood, regional, and citywide assemblies, where residents and elected budget delegates identify spending priorities and vote on which priorities to implement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{Cite journal | date = December 31, 2002 |url= http://www.yesmagazine.org/article.asp?ID=562 |title = Porto Alegre's Budget Of, By, and For the People | first = David | last = Lewit |journal= Yes! Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Porto Alegre spends about 200 million dollars per year on construction and services, this money is subject to participatory budgeting.  Annual spending on fixed expenses, such as debt service and pensions, is not subject to public participation. Around fifty thousand residents of Porto Alegre now take part in the participatory budgeting process (compared to 1.5 million city inhabitants), with the number of participants growing year on year since 1989. Participants are from diverse economic and political backgrounds.&lt;ref name= autogenerated2 /&gt;

The participatory budgeting cycle starts in January and assemblies across the city facilitate maximum participation and interaction. Each February there is instruction from city specialists in technical and system aspects of city budgeting. In March there are plenary assemblies in each of the city's 16 districts as well as assemblies dealing with such areas as transportation, health, education, sports, and economic development.  These large meetings—with participation that can reach over 1,000—elect delegates to represent specific neighborhoods. The mayor and staff attend to respond to citizen concerns. In the following months, delegates meet weekly or biweekly in each district to review technical project criteria and district needs. City department staff may participate according to their area of expertise. At a second regional plenary, regional delegates prioritize the district's demands and elect 42 councillors representing all districts and thematic areas to serve on the Municipal Council of the Budget. The main function of the Municipal Council of the Budget is to reconcile the demands of each district with available resources, and to propose and approve an overall municipal budget.  The resulting budget is binding, though the city council can suggest, but not require changes. Only the Mayor may veto the budget, or remand it back to the Municipal Council of the Budget (this has never happened).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

=== Argentina ===
The city of Rosario&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rosario.gov.ar/web/gobierno/presupuestos/presupuesto-participativo/resultados-del-presupuesto-participativo-2018|title=Resultados del Presupuesto Participativo 2018|website=Sitio de la Municipalidad de Rosario|language=es|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Argentina mixed participatory budgeting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.citizenlab.co/blog/civic-engagement/participatory-budgeting/what-if-citizens-set-city-budgets-with-participatory-budgeting/|title=What if citizens set the city budgets? - CitizenLab|website=www.citizenlab.co|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an approach called ‘gender budgeting’. In practice it means taking appropriate actions to involve more women in the participatory budgeting process, and to make all participants more sensitive of gender issues and the impact of the participatory budgeting projects on these issues.

===United States of America &amp; Canada===
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2018}}

The first recorded Participatory Budgeting process in the United States of America is in the [[Rogers Park, Chicago|Rogers Park]] neighborhood of [[Chicago]], Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 2010-05-27 | url = http://permaculture.org.au/2010/05/27/chicagos-1-3-million-experiment-in-democracy/|title= Chicago's $1.3 Million Experiment in Democracy | place = [[Australia|AU]] | publisher = The Permaculture Research Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = Yes Magazine | date = April 10, 2010 | title = Chicago's $1.3 Million Experiment in Democracy; For the First Time in the US, the City's 49th Ward Lets Taxpayers Directly Decide How Public Money is Spent | url = http://www.yesmagazine.org/people-power/chicagos-1.3-million-experiment-in-democracy| last1 = Lerner | first1 = Josh }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Led by the ward's Alderman, Joe Moore, Chicago's 49th Ward is undertaking this process&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ward49.com/participatory-budgeting/ |title= Participatory budgeting | place = Chicago | publisher = 49th Ward|accessdate= April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Alderman's "Menu Money."  Menu Money is a yearly budgeted amount each of Chicago's 50 wards receives for use on capital expenses. This money in other wards is typically allocated at the complete discretion of a ward's Alderman. Since 2011 more examples have been occurring in the US, in [[New York City]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://pbnyc.org/ |title=Participatory budgeting in New York City |accessdate=April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now [[Participatory budgeting in Vallejo, California|citywide in Vallejo, California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Public policy | url = http://publicpolicy.pepperdine.edu/davenport-institute/incommon/index.php/2012/04/city-wide-pb-in-vallejo-ca/ | publisher = Pepperdine | title= Participatory budgeting city wide in Vallejo, CA |accessdate= April 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently in [[Greensboro, NC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.greensboro-nc.gov/index.aspx?page=4796 | publisher = City of Greensboro| title= City of Greensboro NC: Participatory Budgeting |accessdate= December 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Boston, the first youth-led participatory budgeting process in the US allows teens to decide how to spend $1 million of the city's budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://youth.boston.gov/youth-lead-the-change/|title=Participatory Budgeting Boston|last=|first=|date=|website=Youth Lead the Change|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Municipal Processes ====

===== Cambridge, Massachusetts =====
Cambridge's first PB occurred in 2014-2015, with $528,000 allocated towards the implementation of six winning projects. Winning projects included one hundred healthy trees, twenty laptops for a community center, bilingual books for children learning english, a public bathroom in Central Square, bike report stations, and free public wifi in six outdoor locations.

===== New York City =====
New York City's Participatory Budgeting process (PBNYC) is the largest in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://council.nyc.gov/html/pr/092115launch.shtml|title=Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito and New York City Council Launch 2015-2016 Participatory Budgeting Cycle|last=|first=|date=|website=New York City Council|publisher=|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process began in 2011-2012 as a pilot program in four City Council districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.participatorybudgeting.org/about-participatory-budgeting/examples-of-participatory-budgeting/|title=Examples of PB|last=|first=|date=|website=Participatory Budgeting Project|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its sixth year (2016-2017), PBNYC has grown to include 31 of the city's 51 districts. Community members in each district decide how to spend at least $1 million of their City Council member's discretionary funds.&lt;ref name="Participate"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://labs.council.nyc/pb/participate/|title=Participate|website=New York City Council|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PBNYC cycles run from early fall through the spring. Districts hold neighborhood meetings to collect ideas for community improvement projects. Idea collection is focused particularly on hard-to-reach communities, such as immigrants with limited English proficiency, youth, senior citizens, and public housing residents. Volunteers then research community needs and work with city agencies to turn ideas into concrete proposals. The proposals are put to a community vote, which is open to any resident of the district over the age of 14. City agencies implement the winning projects.&lt;ref name="Participate"/&gt;

==== Housing Complex Processes ====

===== Toronto (Canada) =====
In Toronto Community Housing, PB is part of a broader "tenant participation system." PB has been a part of Toronto Community Housing since 2001. This inspired the launch of a three-year pilot of PB at the ward-level in Toronto, beginning in 2015. In the months of May and June 2018 the city will begin debating what to do with PB at the municipal-level, following annual evaluations of the pilot. Thirty-seven projects have been voted for through the entirety of the three-year pilot process, comprising a total of $1.8 million in residents directly allocating funds towards projects.

===== New York City =====
Citing the case of Toronto, Community Voices Heard (CVH) has called for PB within the [[New York City Housing Authority]] (NYCHA). As part of a platform for democratizing and improving access to public housing, CVH has advocated for developing a kind of participatory system tied together by PB. CVH also advocates for a gradual increase of money being allocated through PB as residents become increasingly familiarized with the process.

===== Los Angeles =====
As part of a broader platform for pushing greater investment and public housing, in early 2014 the LA Human Right to Housing collective began advocating for the use of PB in the [[Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles]] (HACLA). This was in response to a budget corruption scandal in November 2012 in HACLA.According to the Collective, nearly one-hundred residents mobilized to demand PB at a HACLA Agency Plan hearing in August 2014. In response, HACLA launched a "values driven participatory budgeting process" developed and coordinated by a consultant. This was a six-week process, consisting of "resident consultation" that fed into decisions ultimately made by administration and management. Participatory elements of the process were "a resident survey" and "resident review of site specific budgets." The Collective regarded both the design and distribution of the survey to be unsatisfactory. Coupled with a lack of technical support, any kind of resident-focused collective deliberation or evidence of resident influence on the outcome of the process, the Collective deemed the process "participatory in name only."

To counter this, the Collective sought to scale up their campaign for a "true participatory budgeting" process by initiating a Model PB process. The process included a combination of one-on-one and door-to-door outreach with deliberation through meetings and assemblies of residents. The Model PB process resulted in tenants and the Collective deepening their critique of HACLA's PB "in name only" as well as putting forward a number of recommendations to create a "true PB" process.

==== Youth, School, and College Processes ====

===== Greater Boston Area =====
Since 2014 a youth PB process has operated in the city of Boston. Today the process allows persons aged between 12 and 25 years old to decide how to allocate one million dollars.

In 2013-2014 MIT's International Development Group within the school's Department of Urban Studies and Planning conducted an $8,000 PB process. Voting was not over allocating money to specific project proposals, but rather to determining exact allotments to four broad distinct budget categories: field trips, social events, project funding, and cultural event series. To determine precise allotments, "each participant allocated a percentage value of the $8,000 to each category. The average for each category was taken and a preliminary set of results was disclosed." The MIT intra-departmental process provides an example of how PB can be utilized to not only determine the allocation of funds within a specific budget category, but also to determine how funds are distributed across budget categories.

===== Chicago =====
In Spring 2015 Sullivan High School conducted a $25,000 participatory budgeting process. Seventy percent of the student body voted in the process, with the money allocated towards building a new recreation room.

===== New York =====
Within PBNYC youth participation has been semi-formalized in various forms. This includes the youth-led formation of the District 39 PB Youth Committee. District 3 also possesses a PB Youth Committee December 2015, which works in collaboration with an organization called Friends of the High Line. In his State of the City address, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that PB would be launched in every public high school. Each participating school will receive $2,000 for students to allocate through PB. PB has also been launched at various colleges in the City University of New York. These have included Queens College, Brooklyn College, City Tech, Hunter College, and the CUNY Graduate Center.

===== Phoenix =====
Ten high schools allocated $55,000 of district-wide funds in Phoenix through PB.

===== San Antonio =====
In 2013 a $25,000 PB process was launched at Palo Alto Community College. Initially this was only open to faculty and staff. In fall 2015 the process was opened to students as well. The 2018 process expanded the pot of funds from $25,000 to $50,000.

===United Kingdom===

PB in the United Kingdom was initially introduced as part of the 'New Labour' Party's decentralization agenda that aimed to empower the local governments in the first decade of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hazel Blears]], the Labour MP, "[...] played a key role in the inclusion of PB on the national policy agenda[...]," pushing for greater community participation and empowerment in the governmental structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this new political ambiance, the British PB, inspired by Porto Alegre's example, gained traction for implementation, especially through the active engagement of local NGO's and community activists, namely the Community Pride Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt at PB was initiated as a pilot in the city of [[Bradford]] in 2004, and its "procedural model consists of two main steps: the elaboration of project schemes by local community groups and a decision about these schemes by all involved groups during a public meeting."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bradford process, while limited to small funding, helped PB spread to other cities such as [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In addition to the bottom-up activism in local communities, Blears's initiative for PB on the national level helped promote its implementation and diffusion more broadly, and by 2011, there were at least 150 recorded cases of PB, albeit being limited to small funding and designated personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "UK style" of PB, as Anja Rocke puts it, "in form of small grant-spending processes with no secured financial basis and organized at the margins of the political system," failed to gain enough momentum to be established nationally as a formal decision-making procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rocke|first1=Anja|title=Framing Citizen Participation: Participatory Budgeting in France, Germany, and the United Kingdom|date=2014|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=London, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-137-32666-9|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Scotland ====
The [[Scottish Government]] has made a commitment to participatory budgeting, saying "We support PB as a tool for community engagement and for developing participatory democracy in Scotland".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.gov.scot/policies/community-empowerment/participatory-budgeting/|title=Community empowerment: Participatory budgeting - gov.scot|website=beta.gov.scot|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Scottish Government and the [[Convention of Scottish Local Authorities]] have agreed that at least 1% of local government budgets will be subject to participatory budgeting by the end of 2021, potentially amounting to £100million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://news.gov.scot/news/more-choice-for-communities|title=More choice for communities|website=Scottish Government News|language=en|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scottish Government allocates funding for participatory budgeting through the Community Choices Fund, delivered in partnership between the Government, local authorities, communities and third sector organisations.

===== Support and tools =====
There is a national network to support participatory budgeting called the [https://pbscotland.scot/network PB Scotland Network]. Glasgow Community Planning Partnership has worked with What Works Scotland to develop a toolkit to assess the impact of its PB activities and develop an improvement plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whatworksscotland.ac.uk/publications/glasgows-participatory-budgeting-evaluation-toolkit/|title=Glasgow's Participatory Budgeting Evaluation Toolkit {{!}} What Works Scotland|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Review and evaluation =====
A number of analyses and reviews of participatory budgeting in Scotland have been published since 2015, including:

===Republic of Korea===
In 2005, the national government revised its Local Finance Act to promote citizen participation in the local government budgeting process in response to a few of the local governments that initially took a bottom-up approach in experimenting with forms of PB.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Soonhee|title=Participatory Governance and Polcy Diffusion in Local Governments in Korea: Implementation of Participatory Budgeting|date=January 2016|publisher=Korea Development institute|location=Sejong-si, Korea|isbn=979-11-5932-106-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Ministry of Security and Public Administration invested in the nation-wide promotion of PB system diffusion, and under [[Myung Bak Lee|Myung Bak Lee's]] Administration in 2011, the newly revised Local Finance Act required all local governments to adopt PB.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"/&gt;

Before the 2011 decree, approximately 45% of local governments had already been utilizing the PB system, and it took 3 years for the remaining municipalities to fulfill the mandate.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"/&gt; The PB System of [[Seoul Metropolitan Government]] served as the benchmark for other local governments' adoption of PB in those years.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"/&gt; Seoul, city with the world's 4th highest GDP, runs a PB committee of 300 people representing 25 districts. The committee is then split into 11 different budgetary fields such as parks and recreation, culture, environment, and etc. In its first year, Seoul citizens voted and finalized on 223 projects worth 50.3 billion KRW, and most recently in 2017, the PB system finalized 766 projects amounting to 59.3 billion KRW (approximately 55 million USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=참여예산제|url=http://yesan.seoul.go.kr/intro/index.do|website=서울특별시 시민참여예산|publisher=서울특별시청|accessdate=10 March 2018| language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive study of Korea's PB in 2016 suggests that PB in Korea has allocated most of public budget to the following three areas: land/local development, transportation, and culture and tourism. Transparency in budget documents and information sharing has increased since 2011, and the approval rates by local PB committees averaged to approximately 70%. On the other hand, the study also points out that the lack of citizen capacity, inadequate resources for smaller municipalities, and limited representativeness of vested interests as some of the most unresolved challenges in Korea's PB implementation.&lt;ref name="Korea Development institute"/&gt;

===India===

India's experience with PB has been limited despite its 74th Constitutional Amendment, which proposes to the state and local governments the formation of ward committees composed of local citizens to direct ward-level budgets.&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keruwala|first1=Naim|title=Participatory Budgeting in India-The Pune Experiment|journal=The Budget Bulletin|date=June–August 2013|volume=V|url=http://www.nfi.org.in/sites/default/files/newsletter/THE%20BUDGET%20BULLETIN_1.pdf|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such initiative was not implemented, and thus there were only few cities that experimented with PB, which are [[Bangalore]], [[Myso]], [[Pune]], and [[Hiware Bazar]].&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013" /&gt;

Bangalore was the first to implement PB in India in 2001 with the help of a local NGO. Similarly, Pune was able to adopt PB in 2006 with the help of several local NGOs. Pune's PB system was met with a large response from its local citizens, and multiple online and offline workshops were carried out to foster the implementation&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013" /&gt; As a result, Pune has experienced both increased citizen participation and budget allocation, which are directed primarily towards roads, electricity, slum-improvement, and water shortage.&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013" /&gt; Influenced by Pune's PB, Pimpri-Chinchwad, the fifth-most populated city of Maharashtra, also began to adopt the framework soon after.&lt;ref name="Keruwala2013" /&gt;

Hiware Bazar may have served as the most successful example of PB in India. On June 25, 2015, Delhi Deputy chief Minister Manish Sisodia presented the Swaraj Budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Highlights of Swaraj budget presented by deeputy CM SH Manish Sisodia | url = http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/highlights-of-swaraj-budget-presented-by-deputy-cm-sh-manish-sisodia | publisher = Aam Admi party}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Aam Admi Party Swaraj Budget was prepared based on voting from the people of different constituencies. In each constituency three meetings were held; each meeting  was attended by 200–300 residents, and a list of key issues was prepared, which was then voted on to decide the top priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The Times of India | publisher = India Times | url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Aam-aadmi-gives-Swaraj-budget-a-thumbs-up/articleshow/46981634.cms | title = Aam Admi gives Swaraj budget a thumbs up}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/?id=qk6YyKRRIk0C&amp;pg=PT3 |title=Swaraj |work= Books |isbn=9789350299371 |last1=Kejriwal |first1=Arvind |date=2012-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/page/goal-of-swaraj|title=Goal of Swaraj | publisher = Aam Aadmi Party}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the village, once bereft of water, education, and basic needs for life, is now self-sufficient with a high per capita income.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Dhara|first1=Sagar|title=Including People in Governance|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/including-people-in-governance/article6483234.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=2014-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===

For South Africa, the mechanisms for citizen participation is written in its constitution. Each municipality has its budgetary committee formed with representatives from its 'wards' that deal directly with its budgeting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The World Bank Group's research lists [[Mangaung]] and [[Ekurhuleni]] municipalities as representative cases to demonstrate the typical PB process in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, the process for the council is fixed by the mayor, who sets up certain deadlines for the council to deliberate within.&lt;ref name="Participatory Budgeting"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|pages=207–208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, the municipality is divided geographically into 'wards', and  the public budget is drawn with any desired submission from the community through their ward representatives.&lt;ref name="Participatory Budgeting"/&gt; The tentatively accumulated budget plan is then publicized so that any citizens or "stakeholders" can make their final inputs, and the final version is submitted to the national and provincial governments for approval.&lt;ref name="Participatory Budgeting"/&gt;

On a nation-wide level, the South African municipalities, as a result of PB, have witnessed the public budget "shift from infrastructure development to local economic development, a higher priority for citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, PB is being carried out in 284 municipalities, each varying slightly in its process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rate of transparency for the municipal governments has increased because the sub-organization ward committees are able to maintain consistently ongoing communication with the citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the challenges in South African local governance still prevail as a result of the lack of resources and limited capacities assigned to PB. Furthermore, language barriers and cultural differences also provide immediate obstacles for holistic communications between various wards and social groups within the municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shah|first1=Anwar|title=Participatory Budgeting|date=2007|publisher=The World Bank|location=Washington D.C.|isbn=978-0-8213-6924-1|url=https://siteresources.worldbank.org/PSGLP/Resources/ParticipatoryBudgeting.pdf|accessdate=12 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iceland===
The Better Neighbourhoods participatory budgeting project of the wider [[citizen sourcing]] Better Reykjavik project of the City of Reykjavik was established in 2011. Nearly 2 million Euros (300 million ISK) has been allocated each year with over citizen proposed 100 projects funded most years. The project is mostly driven by digital participation with secure electronic voting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.citizens.is/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Better-Neighbourhoods-Participatory-budgeting-in-Reykjavik-2011-2015.pdf|title=Better Neighborhoods 2011 to 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=Citizens Foundation|publisher=|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/754a9442-af7b-11e7-8076-0a4bdda92ca2|title=The world watches Reykjavik's digital democracy experiment|last=|first=|date=|website=Financial Times|publisher=Financial Times|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buenos Aires===
Buenos Aires adopted the PB process in 2001 hoping to emerge a political economy. There were manipulators like people watching the system and third parties forming for or against the PB system. Buenos aires used a system where the communities allocated where the government would take action first by ranking where the cities resources would go. After participation decreased by 50% in the 2005 cycle, PB came to an end and "the new communes" emerged.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Criticism==
Reviewing the experience in Brazil and Porto Alegre a [[World Bank]] paper points out that lack of representation of extremely poor people in participatory budgeting can be a shortcoming. Participation of the very poor and of the young is highlighted as a challenge.{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003|p=5}} What are the insights regarding the opportunities for and barriers to accomplishing the goal of participatory-based budgeting? It takes leadership to flatten the organizational structure and make conscious ethical responsibilities as individuals and as committee members try to achieve the democratic goals means that the press should be present for the public, and yet the presence of the press inhibits the procedural need for robust discussion. Or, while representation is a cornerstone to participatory budgeting, a group being so large has an effect on the efficiency of the group. Participatory budgeting may also struggle to overcome existing [[clientelism]]. Other observations include that particular groups are less likely to participate once their demands have been met and that slow progress of public works can frustrate participants.{{Sfn | Bhatnagar | Rathore | Torres | Kanungo | 2003}}{{Page needed |date=October 2015}}

In Chicago, participatory budgeting has been criticized for increasing funding to recreational projects while allocating less to infrastructure projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2017/04/24/pitfalls-participatory-budgeting|title=The Pitfalls of Participatory Budgeting|last=|first=|date=|work=Chicago Tonight {{!}} WTTW|access-date=2017-12-11|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Physics Instructional Association''' ('''PIRA'''&lt;ref&gt;http://physicslearning2.colorado.edu/pira/&lt;/ref&gt;) is an association of [[physics education]] professionals and enthusiasts.  Members are physics teachers, physics administrators, physics educational support staff and physics students.  Interests cover all aspects of physics education with an emphasis on [[Demonstration (teaching)|demonstrations]], [[laboratory|laboratories]] and outreach.

The association is also responsible for maintaining the Demonstration Classification Scheme (DCS), a standardized scheme for categorization of physics demonstrations.

==Affiliations==
PIRA holds annual meetings during the summer meeting of the [[American Association of Physics Teachers]].  It is sponsored by the Apparatus Committee and annually hosts the Lecture Demonstration Workshop.  PIRA assists or hosts the Physics Demonstrations Show at each summer meeting when the hosting institution requests.

==Demonstration bibliography==
PIRA has continually updated the Demonstration Bibliography since its inception in the 1980s.  It is based on a unique numbering system called the Demonstration Classification Scheme (DCS).&lt;ref&gt;http://physicslearning.colorado.edu/PiraHome/dcs/PIRADCS.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The scheme originated from the demonstrations catalog used at the University of Minnesota.

PIRA has also generated a subset of this list called the PIRA 200.&lt;ref&gt;http://physicslearning2.colorado.edu/pira/resources/pira-200&lt;/ref&gt;  These 200 demonstrations are the recommended basic collection for any physics department.

'''Political history''' is the narrative and analysis of political events, ideas, movements, organs of government, voters, parties and leaders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/hi/DicHist/analytic/anaV.html Politics: The historical development of economic, legal, and political ideas and institutions, ideologies and movements.] In ''The Dictionary of the History of Ideas''.&lt;/ref&gt; It is interrelated to other fields of history, especially [[diplomatic history]], as well as constitutional history and [[public history]].

Political history studies the organization and operation of power in large societies. By focusing on the elites in power, on their impact on society, on popular response, and on the relationships with the elites in other [[social history]], which focuses predominantly on the actions and lifestyles of ordinary people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jsh/39.3/parthasarathi.html/facts.about.me Parthasarathi, Prasannan, "The State and Social History]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[people's history]], which is historical work from the perspective of the common people.

In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with [[social history]] rose from 31% to 41%, and the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Diplomatic dropped from 5% to 3%, economic history from 7% to 5%, and cultural history grew from 14% to 16%. Based on full-time professors in U.S. history departments. [[Stephen H. Haber]], David M. Kennedy, and Stephen D. Krasner, "Brothers under the Skin: Diplomatic History and International Relations," ''International Security,'' Vol. 22, No. 1 (Summer, 1997), pp. 34-43 at p. 4 2; [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2539326 online at JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; In the history departments of British and Irish universities in 2014, of the 3410 faculty members reporting, 878 (26%) identified themselves with [[social history]], and political history came next at 841 (25%) faculty members.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.history.ac.uk/history-online/teachers "History Online:Teachers of History"] accessed 1/21/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political world history ==
{{main|history of political thinking}}

The [[political history of the world]] is the history of the evolution of the political events, ideas, movements, leaders and entities, and the way these elements shape society as a whole; Special importance is their crystallisation into political entities such as republics, empires and so on; and the study of [[Diplomatic history|the international relations between them]].  Together with this descriptive analysis, the [[history of political thinking]] narrates the evolution of the political ideas and philosophy, and goes back to antiquity. Political history, and thus the history of political thinking throughout human existence stretches though up to Medieval period and the Renaissance. In the Age of Enlightenment, political entities expanded from basic systems of self-governance and monarchy to the complex democratic and communist systems that exist of the Industrialied and the Modern Era, in parallel, political systems have expanded from vaguely defined frontier-type boundaries, to the definite boundaries existing today.

==Aspects of political history==
The first "scientific" political history was written by [[Leopold von Ranke]] in Germany in the 19th century.  His methodologies profoundly affected the way historians critically examine sources; see [[historiography]] for a more complete analysis of the methodology of various approaches to history. An important aspect of political history is the study of [[ideology]] as a force for historical change. One author asserts that "political history as a whole cannot exist without the study of ideological differences and their implications."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/cp/vol-02/no-02/author/ Freeman, Joanne B., "Founding Bothers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629093305/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/cp/vol-02/no-02/author/ |date=2007-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of political history typically centre around a single [[nation]] and its political change and development. Some historians identify the growing trend towards narrow specialization in political history during recent decades: "while a college professor in the 1940s sought to identify himself as a "historian", by the 1950s "American historian" was the designation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Jensen]], Historiography of American Political History. In Jack Greene, ed., ''Encyclopedia of American Political History'' (New York: Scribner's, 1984), vol 1. pp 1-25&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s onwards, new movements challenged traditional approaches to political history. The development of [[social history]]  shifted the emphasis away from the study of leaders and national decisions, and towards the role of ordinary people, especially outsiders and minorities. Younger scholars shifted to different issues, usually focused on race, class and gender, with little room for elites. After 1990 social history itself began to fade, replaced with postmodern and cultural approaches that rejected grand narrative.

===United States: The new political history===
Traditional political history focused on major leaders and had long played a dominant role among academic historians in the United States. These studies accounted for about 25% of the scholarly books and articles written by American historians before 1950, and about 33% into the 1960s, followed by diplomacy. The arrival in the 1960s and 1970s of a new interest in [[social history]] led to the emergence of the "new political history" which saw young scholars put much more emphasis on the voters' behavior and motivation, rather than just the politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Allan G. Bogue, "United States: The 'new' political history." ''Journal of Contemporary History'' (1968) 3#1 pp: 5-27. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/259964 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allan G. Bogue, "The new political history in the 1970s." in Michael G. Kammen, ed., ''The Past Before Us: Contemporary Historical Writing in the United States'' (1980) pp: 231-251.&lt;/ref&gt;  It relied heavily on quantitative methods to integrate social themes, especially regarding ethnicity and religion.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Swierenga, "Ethnocultural political analysis: a new approach to American ethnic studies," ''Journal of American Studies'' (1971) 5#1 pp: 59-79.&lt;/ref&gt; The new social science approach was a harbinger of the fading away of interest in Great Men. The eclipse of traditional political approaches during the 1970s was a major shock, though diplomatic history fell even further. It was upstaged by social history, with a race/class/gender model. The number of political articles submitted to the ''Journal of American History'' fell by half from 33% to 15%. Patterson argued that contemporary events, especially the Vietnam War and Watergate, alienated younger scholars away from the study of politicians and their deeds.  Political history never disappeared, but it never recovered its dominance among scholars, despite its sustained high popularity among the reading public.&lt;ref&gt;James T. Patterson,  "The Persistence of Political History" in  Richard S. Kirkendall, ed. ''The Organization of American Historians and the Writing and Teaching of American History'' (2011)  pp 67-74; his statistical estimates appear on pp 70, 72&lt;/ref&gt;  Some political historians made fun of their own predicament, as when [[William Leuchtenburg]] wrote, "the status of the political historians within the profession has sunk to somewhere between that of a faith healer and a chiropractor.  Political historians were all right in a way, but you might not want to bring one home to meet the family."&lt;ref&gt;William Leuchenburg, "The Pertinence of Political History: Reflection on the Significance of the State In America," ''Journal of American History''  (Dec. 1986) 73:585-600 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1902978 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  Others were more analytical, as when Hugh Davis Graham observed:
:The ranks of traditional political historians are depleted, their assumptions and methods discredited, along with the Great White Man whose careers they chronicled.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Davis Graham, "The stunted career of policy history: a critique and an agenda." ''The Public Historian'' (1993): 15-37. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3377943 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
Readman (2009) discusses the historiography of British political history in the 20th century. He describes how British political scholarship mostly ignored 20th century history due to temporal proximity to the recent past, the unavailability of primary sources, and the potential for bias. The article explores how transitions in scholarship have allowed for greater interest in 20th century history among scholars, which include less reliance on archival sources, methodological changes in historiography, and the flourishing of new forms of history such as oral history.&lt;ref&gt;Readman (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In the course of the 1960s, however, some German historians (notably [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] and his cohort) began to rebel against this idea, instead suggesting a "Primacy of Domestic Politics" (''Primat der Innenpolitik''), in which the insecurities of (in this case German) domestic policy drove the creation of foreign policy.  This led to a considerable body of work interpreting the domestic policies of various states and the ways this influenced their conduct of foreign policy.

===France===
The French ''[[Annales School]]'' had already put an emphasis on the role of geography and economics on history, and of the importance of broad, slow cycles rather than the constant apparent movement of the "history of events" of high politics.  It downplayed politics and diplomacy. The most important work of the ''Annales'' school, [[Fernand Braudel]]'s ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'', contains a traditional Rankean diplomatic history of Philip II's Mediterranean policy, but only as the third and shortest section of a work largely focusing on the broad cycles of history in the ''longue durée'' ("long term").  The ''Annales'' were broadly influential, leading to a turning away from political history towards an emphasis on broader trends of economic and environmental change.

===Social history===
{{main|Social history}}
In the 1960s and 1970s, an increasing emphasis on giving a voice to the voiceless and writing the history of the underclasses, whether by using the quantitative statistical methods of [[social history]] or the more postmodern assessments of [[cultural history]], also undermined the centrality of politics to the historical discipline. Leff noted how social historians, "disdained political
history as elitist, shallow, altogether passe, and irrelevant to the drama of everyday lives."&lt;ref&gt;Mark H. Leff, "Revisioning US political history." ''American Historical Review'' (1995) 100#3 pp: 829-853, quote p 829. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2168607 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;


===History of political regimes and institutions===
*MaxRange data is a project that defines and shows in detail the political status and development of institutional regimes of all states in the world from 1789. MaxRange also describes the background, development, external sources and major causes behind all political changes.
MaxRange is a dataset defining level of democracy and institutional structure(regime-type) on a 100-graded scale where every value represents a unique regimetype. Values are sorted from 1-100 based on level of democracy and political accountability. MaxRange defines the value (regimetype) corresponding to all states and every month from 1789 to 2015 and updating. MaxRange is created and developed by Max Range, and is now associated with the university of Halmstad, Sweden &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hh.se/english/schoolofeducationhumanitiesandsocialsciences/research/maxrange.65441985_en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Portraits of Periodical Offering''''' ({{zh|s=职贡图|t=職貢圖|p=Zhígòngtú}}) was a series of official historical paintings (with illustration on each of the portrait) used in the [[China|Chinese]] dynasties. These paintings were official historical documents. The phrase roughly translated to "duty offering pictorial". Throughout Chinese history, kingdoms and tribes conquered by Chinese forces were required to send ambassadors to the imperial court of China periodically and pay tribute with valuable gifts (贡品 ''gongbin'').

Drawings and paintings with short descriptions were used to record the expression of these ambassadors and to a lesser extent to show the cultural aspects of these ethnic groups. These historical descriptions beside the portrait became the equivalent of documents of diplomatic relations with each country. The drawings were reproduced in [[woodblock printing]] after the 9th century and distributed among the bureaucracy in albums. The ''Portraits of Periodical Offering of Imperial Qing'' by Xie Sui (谢遂), completed in 1751, gives verbal descriptions of outlying tribes as far as the island of [[Great Britain|Britain]] in [[Western Europe]].

The ''Portraits of Periodical Offering of Liang'' by the [[Emperor Yuan of Liang|Emperor Yuan of Liang Xiao Yi]], dated to the 6th century, is the earliest surviving of these specially significant paintings. The original of the work was lost, and the only surviving edition of this work was a copy from the 11th century, which is currently preserved at the [[National Museum of China]]. The work originally consisted of twenty five portraits of ambassadors from their respectively country, by the time of [[Song Dynasty]] some portraits were already missing, and the current version consist only about twelve of them.

The envoys from right to left: [[Uar]] ([[Hephthalites]]); [[Persia]]; [[Baekje]]; [[Qiuci]]; [[Wa (Japan)|Wo]] ([[Japan]]); [[Langkasuka]]; Dengzhi (邓至) ([[Qiang people|Qiang]]) ethnic from [[Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture|Ngawa]]; Zhouguke (周古柯), Hebatan (呵跋檀), Humidan (胡密丹), Baiti (白題, of similar Hephthalite stocks), who dwell close to Hephthalite; Mo ([[Qiemo]]).

{{Wide image|Zhigongtu full.jpg|1500px|align-cap=center|The ''Portraits of Periodical Offering of Liang'' with descriptions on the back of each ambassador, 6th-century painting in the [[National Museum of China]].}}

Another notable painting of the series is the ''Portraits of Periodical Offering of Tang'' by painter [[Yan Liben]], depicting foreign envoys with tribute bearers for the [[Tang Dynasty]] arriving at [[Chang'an]] in 631, during the reign of the [[Emperor Taizong of Tang]]. The painting consists of 27 people from various states. The original work was lost, and the only surviving edition was a Song Dynasty copy, which is currently preserved at the [[National Palace Museum]] in Taipei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign Envoys with Tribute Bearers|url=http://tech2.npm.gov.tw/english/dm/painting/b_01.htm|website=National Palace Museum|access-date=2015-04-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916193338/http://tech2.npm.gov.tw/english/dm/painting/b_01.htm|archive-date=2015-09-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Projexity''' is a Canadian company that offers online audience engagement tools to groups, organizations and municipalities. Projexity's tools have predominantly been used by organizations with strong social impact mandates like the David Suzuki Foundation.

Projexity's tools aim to make it easy for the public to submit content such as events and initiatives to organizations directly through their own websites, effectively transforming any website into a dynamic community hub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://projexity.com/ |title=About |publisher=Projexity |date= |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The platform was originally created by designers [[Nicolas Koff]] and [[Marisa Bernstein]], and computer programmer [[Jonathan Koff]] as a means to bring more public engagement and transparency to the often exclusive city building process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/metromorning/episodes/2013/04/04/crowd-sourcing/ |title=Metro Morning &amp;#124; Crowdsourcing |publisher=CBC.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Promulgation''' in the '''canon law''' of the [[Catholic Church]] is the publication of a law by which it is made known publicly, and is required by [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] for the law to obtain legal effect. Universal [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|laws]] are promulgated when they are published in ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'', and unless specified to the contrary, [[vacatio legis|obtain legal force]] three months after promulgation.&lt;ref name=Canon8.1&gt;Canon 8 §1, [[1983 Code of Canon Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; Particular laws are promulgated in various ways but by default take effect one month after promulgation.&lt;ref name=Canon8.2&gt;Canon 8 §2, [[1983 Code of Canon Law]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and nature==
Promulgation is the act by which the legislator manifests to those subject to his jurisdiction the decision that he has made and makes known to them his intention to bind them to the observance of his law.&lt;ref name=Metz41&gt;Metz, René. ''What is Canon Law?'', pg. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without having been promulgated, the canonical law in question has no legal effect, since promulgation is "an essential factor of legislation"&lt;ref&gt;Della Rocca, ''Manual of Canon Law'', pg. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; and "an absolute condition for the effectiveness of a law".&lt;ref name=Metz41/&gt;
{{quote|
For as law is a rational precept, no one can be bound to obey it if it have not been sufficiently made known to him. Ignorance takes away the voluntary ;&lt;ref&gt;Sic (space after "voluntary" and before semicolon).&lt;/ref&gt; and where there is nothing voluntary there can be no fault or punishment.&lt;ref name=Cyclopedia393&gt;Taunton, Ethelred Luke. ''The Law of the Church: A Cyclopedia of Canon Law for English-speaking Countries'' (1906: K. Paul, Trench, Trübner &amp; Company, Limited, 1906), pg. 393. https://books.google.com/books?id=AiS4eZsQyCwC&amp;dq=Taunton,+Cyclopaedia+Canon+law&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 accessed 18 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Promulgation is a "formal and fundamental element"&lt;ref name=Manual70&gt;Della Rocca, Fernando. ''Manual of Canon Law'', pg. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; of canon law. For the purposes of canonical jurisprudence, promulgation is equivalent to publication.&lt;ref name=Manual70/&gt;

Once promulgation takes place, a canonical law acquires its last "essential condition" and takes immediate effect,&lt;ref name=Abbo&amp;Hannan16&gt;Abbo &amp; Hannan, ''Sacred Canons'', pg. 16 (commentary on canon 8, 1917 CIC)&lt;/ref&gt; subject to the ''[[vacatio legis]]'' imposed by universal law, or by the particular legislator issuing a law (see section below).

The nature of promulgation in its relation to the nature of canon law is a matter of discussion among canonical writers. Some canonists hold that promulgation as such "enters the very essence of the law",&lt;ref name=Abbo&amp;Hannan16/&gt; while Abbo &amp; Hannan hold what they assert to be "the more probable opinion that promulgation is merely an extrinsic essential condition ''sine qua non''."&lt;ref name=Abbo&amp;Hannan16/&gt;

==Legal requirements==
{{quote|For sufficient promulgation, the law must be published in such a way that it can come to the notice of the community, although it be not brought specially and singly before the notice of individuals.&lt;ref name=Cyclopedia393/&gt;}}

===Universal &amp; particular law===
A [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|law]] issued by the [[Pope]] (or with his consent in the case of laws issued by an [[ecumenical council]] or [[congregation (Roman Curia)|congregation]]) is promulgated when it is published in ''[[Acta Apostolicae Sedis]]'', and by default has the [[force of law]] three calendar months&lt;ref name=Compendium176&gt;De Meester, ''Juris Canonici Compendium'', v. 1, pg. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; after promulgation.&lt;ref name=Canon8.1/&gt;

{{quote|Pontifical laws and [[apostolic constitution]]s begin to oblige, so far as is ''ex se'', the whole world as soon as they have been solemnly promulgated in [[Diocese of Rome|Rome]] and come to the knowledge of others. It is not necessary that they should be promulgated in every province or [[diocese (Roman Catholic)|diocese]] unless such is stated in the laws themselves.&lt;ref name=Cyclopedia393/&gt;}}

Particular laws, issued by bishops and [[synod|particular council]]s, are promulgated in various ways but, unless specified to the contrary, take effect one calendar month&lt;ref name=Compendium176/&gt;

===''Vacatio legis''===
{{main article|Vacatio legis}}
In principle, a law becomes binding from the time of its promulgation. But because there are often reasons that the immediate efficacy of a law would be detrimental to those upon whom it enjoins, the legislator often orders a delay—''vacatio''—in the law's applicability.&lt;ref&gt;Metz, ''What is Canon Law?'', pg. 42&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[1983 Code of Canon Law|Latin canon law]], the ''vacatio legis'' is three months for universal laws,&lt;ref name="Canon 8 §1"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3.HTM Canon 8 §1]&lt;/ref&gt; and one month for particular laws,&lt;ref name="Canon 8 §2"&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P3.HTM Canon 8 §2]&lt;/ref&gt; unless the law itself establishes a longer or shorter period of time.&lt;ref name="Canon 8 §1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Canon 8 §2"/&gt; The legislator of the law can stipulate a longer or shorter time of ''[[vacatio legis|vacatio]]'' than that which is stipulated generally.&lt;ref name=Manual70/&gt;

===Computation of time===
{{main article|Computation of time}}
Months are computed according to the calendar from the date of publication.&lt;ref name=Manual70/&gt; A "canonical month" (in contradistinction to a "calendar month") is a period of 30 days,&lt;ref&gt;Canon 202 §1, [[1983 Code of Canon Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; while a "calendar month" is a continuous month. The ''[[vacatio legis]]'' is computed according to the calendar; for example, if a law is promulgated on 2 November, and the ''vacatio legis'' is 3 months, then the law takes effect on 2 February.&lt;ref name=Compendium176/&gt; So a universal law has a ''[[vacatio legis]]'' of approximately 90 days—3 months taken according to the calendar—while a particular law has a ''vacatio legis'' of approximately 30 days—1 month taken according to the calendar—unless specified to the contrary.

==History==
{{see also|Legal history of the Catholic Church}}
According to Canon 7 of the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]], ''Lex instituitur cum promulgatur'' ("A law is instituted when it is promulgated").&lt;ref&gt;Canon 7, [[1983 Code of Canon Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; This is an ancient provision in [[Latin Church|Latin-rite]] [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]], dating in its plural form to the [[ecclesiastical Latin|Latin]] formulation of the great twelfth-century [[codification (law)|codifier]] of canon law, [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]]: ''Leges instituuntur cum promulgantur'' ("Laws are instituted when they are promulgated"). The exact same formulation found in Gratian's ''[[Decretum Gratiani|Decretum]]'' was reproduced in the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]],&lt;ref&gt;Canon 8, [[1917 Code of Canon Law]]&lt;/ref&gt; while the Latin plural of the original was modified to its singular form (''Leges'' to ''Lex'', ''instituuntur'' to ''instituitur'', and ''promulgantur'' to ''promulgatur'').

In previous times laws issued by the Holy See were affixed to the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]], the [[Basilica of St. Peter]], the [[Palazzo della Cancelleria|Palace of the Apostolic Chancery]], and in the [[Campo de' Fiori|Campo dei Fiori]]. Since the laws had been posted publicly in the city (Urbi), they were deemed to have been promulgated to the world (Orbi).&lt;ref name=Metz41/&gt; The current method of promulgating universal laws—publishing them in the ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis''—was introduced by Pope Pius X with the apostolic constitution ''Promulgandi'' of 29 September 1908, and was confirmed by the 1917 Code.&lt;ref name=Metz41/&gt;

A recent trend is to promulgate universal laws independently of their publication in the [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis|''Acta Apostolicæ Sedis'']], with the ''Acta'' remaining the source for their official Latin text.&lt;ref name=Coriden30&gt;Coriden, James A., ''et al.'', ''The Code of Canon Law: A Text and Commentary'', pg. 30 (commentary on Canon 8).&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the [[Holy See]] does not give its assent to translations of the [[Latin]] originals (so-called "'authentic' translations"&lt;ref name=Coriden30/&gt;); the Holy See is content to publish the Latin alone, as Latin is the official language of canon law.&lt;ref name=Coriden30/&gt;

==Promulgation in general==
(Lat. ''promulgare,'' to make known, to post in public).
This is the act by which the legislative power makes legislative enactments known to the authorities entrusted with their execution and to the subjects bound to observe them. Philosophically it is a matter of dispute whether promulgation is of the essence of a law. It seems indisputable that the essential element of a law is the will of the legislator, but it is clear that the legislator should make known his will and intention in one way or another. This manifestation is the promulgation of the law, which is not necessarily distinct from the very elaboration of the law, provided that this takes place by external acts-such as the vote of a legislative assembly or by royal sanction. Such is the practice observed in England and in most of the states of the American Union, but, as it was thought too severe, the legislation of various countries requires the promulgation of laws by a special formal act, through which the text of the law is made known to the community, e.g. by publication of this text in an official journal or bulletin of the Government. Previous to this publication the law does not take effect. The promulgation of a law must not be confounded with its publication, the object of the first being to make known the will of the legislator, of the second to spread the knowledge of legislative enactments among subjects bound to observe them.

==Promulgation in canon law==

The Church has long exacted the promulgation of a law by a special act of the authorities: "Leges instituuntur cum promulgantur", a law is not really a law until it has been made known, says Gratian (Decretum Gratiani, pt. I, c. 3, dist. VII). However, no special form is prescribed for acts of ecclesiastical authorities inferior to the pope, even synodal decrees being considered sufficiently promulgated by being read in the synod. The Constitution "Promulgandi" of Pius X (29 September 1908) determined the ordinary method of promulgating pontifical laws, namely by the insertion of the text of the law in the "Acta Apostolica Sedis" (the official publication of the Holy See), after the insertion has been ordered by the secretary or the supreme authority of the congregation or the office through the medium of which the pope has passed the law. A regulation of 5 January 1910, divides the official bulletin of the Holy See into two parts: in the first or official part should be inserted all documents requiring promulgation to have the force of law; the second merely serves to illustrate and supplement the first (Acta Apost. Sedis, 1910, p.&amp;nbsp;36). However, the pope explicitly reserves the right to determine in exceptional cases another method of promulgation. Prior to this law two systems had been chiefly in use in the Church-provincial promulgation, until the end of the thirteenth century, and Roman promulgation. During the first period promulgation often took place in the different ecclesiastical provinces either through special envoys or through the bishops. Nevertheless, it is also a fact that laws binding in one province were also binding in others. During the second period the custom, which became exclusive during the fifteenth century, developed of having the new laws read and posted up by ''cursores'' at Rome only, at the doors of the great basilicas, the Palazzo Cancellaria, the Campo de' fiori, and sometimes at the Capitol. The value of this means of promulgation was disputed in modern times: some claimed that the Church had admitted the arrangements of Novels lxvi and cxvi of Justinian, which required provincial promulgation for some laws; others maintained that in theory publication at Rome was sufficient, but that the popes did not wish to bind the faithful before the laws were made known to them by the bishops; while others appealed to ancient customs, to which the pope should conform. This last theory, made use of by the Gallicans and Febronianists, furnished the State with a pretext for preventing the promulgation of laws which it did not like. A special method of promulgation was also introduced with the express or tacit consent of the Holy See for the decrees of congregations; they were published at the secretariate of the dicasteries from which they emanated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4737">'''Sage writing''' was a [[genre]] of [[creative nonfiction]] popular in the [[Victorian era]]. The concept originates with John Holloway's 1953 book ''The Victorian Sage: Studies in Argument.''

Sage writing is a development from ancient [[wisdom literature]] in which the writer chastises and instructs the reader about contemporary social issues, often utilizing discourses of [[philosophy]], [[history]], [[politics]], and [[economics]] in non-technical ways. Prominent examples of the genre include writings by [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[John Ruskin]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]. Some 20th-century writers, such as [[Joan Didion]] and [[New Journalism|New Journalists]] such as [[Norman Mailer]] and [[Tom Wolfe]], have also been identified as sage writers.

==Characteristic traits==
Holloway constructed the concept as a means to rediscover the value of Victorian writers who had been denigrated by Modernists for their prolixity and moralizing. He wrote "No one, of course, is suggesting that Victorian 'prophetic' literature is an all-sufficing treasury of forgotten wisdom. But by now we can see that the Victorian prophets deserve not embarrassed disregard but respect and thoughtful attention."&lt;ref name = "holl"&gt;Holloway, John. ''The Victorian Sage: Studies in Argument.'' London: Macmillan, 1953, p. 2; p22&lt;/ref&gt;

Holloway identified Thomas Carlyle as the originator of the genre, but traced its origins back to [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]. He argued that Carlyle "wants to state, and to clinch, the basic tenets of a 'Life-Philosophy', of something that will veritably transform men's outlook".&lt;ref name = "holl"/&gt; Carlyle established a model whereby the writer makes non-logical arguments about contemporary social issues, drawing from various forms of modern knowledge and traditional wisdom.

According to [[George Landow (professor)|George Landow]], who developed Holloway's model, sage writing can be distinguished from traditional [[wisdom literature]] in that "Whereas the pronouncements of traditional wisdom literature always take as their point of departure the assumption that they embody the accepted, [[received wisdom]] of an entire society, the pronouncements of the biblical prophet and Victorian sage begin with the assumption that, however traditional their messages may once have been, they are now forgotten or actively opposed by society."&lt;ref&gt;Landow, "The Sage versus the Wisdom Speaker."&lt;/ref&gt; The sage borrows from the [[Old Testament]] [[prophet]]s what Landow identifies as a four-part strategy of "interpretation, attack upon the audience (or those in authority), warning, and visionary promise."&lt;ref&gt;Landow, "The Prophet's Four-Part Pattern."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Sage writing is a development of [[wisdom literature]] drawing much of its energy from the style of [[Old Testament]] [[prophet]]s such as [[Jeremiah]] and [[Isaiah]]; notably, sage writer [[Matthew Arnold]] was once referred to as an "Elegant [[Jeremiah]]".&lt;ref&gt;Landow, "Introduction"&lt;/ref&gt; Landow also lists [[sermon]] writing, [[satire]], and British and [[German Romanticism|German]] [[Romantic poetry]] as formative influences.

'''Satirical ostraca''' are a category of [[Ostracon|ostraca]], (singular: an ''ostracon''), that represent the real world in unrealistic, impossible situations&amp;ndash;a [[satire]]. The common example portrayed which helped create this categorization, are [[animal]]s which take reversed roles, for example a ''vertically&amp;ndash;walking cat, with ducks on the end of [[leash]]es.'' The same role reversals can be seen on [[Satirical papyri]]. This concept is a prevalent feature in absurdist literature, such as in the works of [[Mikhail Bulgakov]].

The '''Scottish Science and Technology Roadshow''' (SCI-FUN), is a non-profit science roadshow for schools run by the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stemdirectories.org.uk/view_scheme.cfm?cit_id=383312 |title=The SCI-FUN Roadshow |publisher=The STEM Directories}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stemscotland.com/page-20081111-115934.html |title=SCI-FUN, the Scottish Science and Technology Roadshow |publisher=STEM Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencelive.net/details.asp?PresenterID=64&amp;Search=sci-fun&amp;PresentationTypeID=0&amp;Company=&amp;AudienceTypeID=0&amp;FreeOfCharge=&amp;SpecialNeeds=&amp;LevelOfExperienceID=0&amp;CRBChecked=&amp;SEAmbassador=&amp;CountiesCoveredID=0&amp;RegionsCoveredID=0&amp;page= |title=The SCI-FUN Roadshow |publisher=Sciencelive |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724054730/http://www.sciencelive.net/details.asp?PresenterID=64&amp;Search=sci-fun&amp;PresentationTypeID=0&amp;Company=&amp;AudienceTypeID=0&amp;FreeOfCharge=&amp;SpecialNeeds=&amp;LevelOfExperienceID=0&amp;CRBChecked=&amp;SEAmbassador=&amp;CountiesCoveredID=0&amp;RegionsCoveredID=0&amp;page= |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iop.org/activity/outreach/resources/mobilscience/projects/page_39623.html |title=Mobile Science Projects around the world |publisher=Institute of Physicis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation states its aim as 'increasing enjoyment of and participation in science and technology-based subjects in Scottish schools' and operates mainly at [[Standard Grade]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=On the road to attract pupils to science fun |url=http://news.scotsman.com/edinburgh/On-the-road-to-attract.5977138.jp |work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] |date=13 January 2010 |accessdate=13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It operates a travelling roadshow which visits schools in Scotland and the north of England, and organises special events such as at the [[Edinburgh International Science Festival]]. Its mode of operation as a travelling roadshow enables SCI-FUN to provide a [[science centre]] experience to pupils in remote areas of Scotland, such as the [[Highlands and Islands]].

==SCI-FUN Roadshow==

The SCI-FUN Roadshow tours secondary schools around Scotland offering a combination of presentations and hands-on exhibits encompassing scientific subjects in the fields of [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[maths]], [[engineering]] and [[technology]]. The Roadshow is presented to S1 and S2 pupils ([[Education in Scotland|11-14 years old]]) with assistance from senior pupils studying sciences at [[Higher (Scottish)|Higher]] or [[Advanced Higher]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pupils shown fun of science |url=http://news.scotsman.com/education/Pupils-shown-fun-of-science.6026274.jp |work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] |date=29 January 2010 |accessdate=30 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010/11 Roadshow includes presentations focusing on the [[senses]] and research, along with a talk encouraging pupils to consider the study of science subjects at [[Standard Grade]].  Current research at the [[University of Edinburgh]] is also covered in collaboration with FUSION; information on research in [[stem cells]], the [[Large Hadron Collider]], the [[Highland midge]] and [[Carbon Capture and Storage]] technology is currently included.  In previous years, talks have discussed [[Climate change]], the [[Stars#Chemical_composition|chemistry of the stars]] and [[:wikt:survival|survival]].

There are around forty-five hands-on exhibits included in the Roadshow to allow pupils to have a go at a number of scientific experiments in a short time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SCI-FUN Roadshow |url=http://www.newbattle.org.uk/News/Newsletters/2010Summer.pdf |work=Newbattle News |date=23 August 2010 |accessdate=13 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721021246/http://www.newbattle.org.uk/News/Newsletters/2010Summer.pdf |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gairlochhigh.wordpress.com/2010/04/07/school-news-2nd-april-2010/ |title=Science events|publisher=Gairloch High School}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A report on the recent Sci-Fun Roadshow compiled by Beck Gillespie and Alex Holden, S6. |url=http://www.lochaber.highland.sch.uk/LHS%20News%2015_Dec%2009.pdf |work=St Ninian's High School Parents' Newsletter |date=March 2010 |accessdate=13 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SCI-FUN Day |url=http://www.st-ninians.e-dunbarton.sch.uk/downloadfile.asp?file=24 |work=News from Lochaber High School |date=December 2009 |accessdate=13 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008222448/http://www.st-ninians.e-dunbarton.sch.uk/downloadfile.asp?file=24 |archivedate=8 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argyll-bute.gov.uk/content/news/general/3271739|title=Sci Fun roadshow rolls into Oban High|publisher=Argyll and Bute Council}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SCI-FUN Primer==

SCI-FUN Primer states its aims as 'explaining to upper primary school children that science is something that is all around them' and is aimed at primary school pupils P6 and P7 (age 9-12). SCI-FUN Primer is based on the hands-on part of the main SCI-FUN Roadshow programme, with activities scaled down so it fits within a classroom environment. This may be hosted by an associated secondary school.

==SCI-FUN at Science Festivals==

===Edinburgh International Science Festival===

SCI-FUN have a presence at the [[Edinburgh International Science Festival]] which is held every year in Edinburgh over the Easter holidays. Elements of the SCI-FUN Roadshow are incorporated into the Science Festival programme, including exhibits and presentations. In 2011, as previous years, SCI-FUN was at Adam House on [[Chambers Street (Edinburgh)|Chambers Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencefestival.co.uk/whats-on/categories/activity/sci-fun-at-discover-science |title=SCI-FUN at Discover Science at the Edinburgh International Science Festival |publisher=Edinburgh International Science Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also presented their Senses show for the general public. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencefestival.co.uk/whats-on/categories/show/the-senses-show |title=The Senses Show |publisher=Edinburgh International Science Festival}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hebridean Science Festival 2011===

SCI-FUN took part in the Hebridean Science Festival in 2011. The festival is run by ESTEEM (Engineering, Science, Technology, Employability, Enterprise, Mathematics), which is based in Stornaway and aims to inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers, technologists and mathematicians from the Western Isles. SCI-FUN ran their usual Roadshow for Hebridean schools, as well as hosting an evening session and a drop-in session for the general public. Other guests at the Hebridean Science Festival include the Astronomer Royal for Scotland Professor [[John Campbell Brown|John C Brown]], [[Johnny Ball]], the [[University of St Andrews]], the [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]], Mr Boom and the Stornoway Astronomical Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hebrideansciencefestival.com/index.aspx |title=Hebridean Science Festival 2011 |publisher=Hebridean Science Festival |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711161244/http://hebrideansciencefestival.com/index.aspx |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Science Festivals===

SCI-FUN has previous attended other Science Festivals around Scotland, including in Shetland and Orkney, and plan to attend more.

==FUSION==

FUSION ''(Focusing on University Science Interpretation and Outreach Needs)'' is the sister group of SCI-FUN that collaborates with research groups within the University to find ways to promote their science to a wider audience. FUSION projects also lead to new topical science materials and exhibits, some of which have already been incorporated within the SCI-FUN Roadshow.

===CCS Interactive===

A major project of FUSION has been to produce the CCS Interactive (Carbon Capture and Storage Interactive) exhibit, with funding from the [[EPSRC]]. The CCS Interactive is a working model of [[Carbon Capture and Storage]] and has been developed alongside the Schools of Engineering and GeoSciences at the University of Edinburgh. The CCS Interactive can be used to demonstrate the process of Carbon Capture and Storage to school and public audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/ViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/G02037X/1 |title=EPSRC grant for the CCSI|publisher=Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carboncapturejournal.com/displaynews.php?NewsID=614|title=The public perception of Carbon Capture and Storage|publisher=Carbon Capture Journal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708120404/http://www.carboncapturejournal.com/displaynews.php?NewsID=614|archivedate=8 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/downloads/news/Global-CCS-Institute-Newsletter-September-2010.pdf|title=Public perception of CCS|publisher=Global CCS Institute}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CCS Interactive consists of a model of a [[fossil fuel]] burning [[power station]] with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; being introduced into the system using a gas cylinder.  There are two carbon capture columns, filled with high surface area [[zeolites]] which CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[adsorbs]] to. Directions of gas flow and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; content of gas emissions are indicated using LEDs, and water vapour is used to simulate the gas emissions from the power station.

==History of SCI-FUN==

SCI-FUN started out as ''FUNdamental Physics'' in the early 1990s. This was a small scale, volunteer-run show focusing on talks about the physical sciences. This was expanded and in 1999 became SCI-FUN in its current form, incorporating the hands-on exhibits about all the sciences and touring the whole of Scotland. A pilot project involved the hiring of equipment from the National Science-Technology Roadshow Trust in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadshow.org |title=National Science-Technology Roadshow Trust|publisher=National Science-Technology Roadshow Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roadshow has evolved over time, increasing collaboration with researchers at the University of Edinburgh and responding to changes in the school curriculum.

==Previous SCI-FUN Projects==

===PP4SS===

Since 2004, Alan Walker from the Department of Physics at the University of Edinburgh has led the PP4SS ''(Particle Physics for Scottish Schools)'' project, funded by the [[PPARC]]. This is a workshop activity aimed at senior secondary school pupils which has been used at school visits, University functions, the Edinburgh International Science Festival and at [[Scottish Parliament]] events. The PP4SS team visited [[CERN]] as part of its 50th Anniversary celebration, along with Professor [[Peter Higgs]] who theorised the existence of the [[Higgs boson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cern50.web.cern.ch/cern50/Welcome.php |title=CERN 50th anniversary|publisher=CERN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LERU===

In 2005 and 2006, SCI-FUN organised and ran the University of Edinburgh's part of the Europe-wide [[LERU]] Kids' University programme. This programme aimed to allow secondary school pupils to experience the University environment at an early stage. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ist-world.org/ProjectDetails.aspx?ProjectId=8c5f026c9212469c898af2118387b433 |title=LERU-Kids-University|publisher=ist world}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work experience placements===

Previously, SCI-FUN has taken on S5 and S6 pupils for work experience placements.  One week work experience places were offered to pupils to either travel out to schools with the Roadshow, or to work in the office developing exhibits or shows.  In the past, pupils have also been offered a chance to apply for a bursary from the [[Nuffield Foundation]] for a six-week placement to work on exhibits for PP4SS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/science-bursaries-schools-and-colleges |title=Science bursaries for schools and colleges |publisher=Nuffield Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Skipper''' is a visualization tool and [[code generator|code/schema generator]] for PHP [[O/R mapper|ORM frameworks]] like [[Doctrine (PHP)|Doctrine2]], [[Doctrine (PHP)|Doctrine]], [[Propel (PHP)|Propel]], and [[CakePHP]], which are used to create [[database abstraction layer]].&lt;ref name="jic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jic.cz/orm-designer |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222032046/http://www.jic.cz/orm-designer |archivedate=2014-02-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phparch"&gt;http://www.phparch.com/2010/05/orm-designer/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phpmagazine"&gt;http://php5.phpmagazine.net/2010/09/orm-designer-reviewed.html{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cheatsheet"&gt;http://www.symfony2cheatsheet.com/#doctrine {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703152651/http://www.symfony2cheatsheet.com/ |date=2014-07-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Skipper is developed by Czech company '''Inventic, s.r.o.''' based in Brno,&lt;ref name="jic"/&gt; and was known as '''ORM Designer''' prior to rebranding in 2014.&lt;ref name="rebrand"&gt;http://blog.skipper18.com/2014/06/press-release-skipper/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
* Generates visual model from the schema definition files&lt;ref name="jic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="phparch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="phpmagazine"/&gt;
* Repetitive import/export of schema definitions in supported formats (XML, YML, PHP annotations)&lt;ref name="jic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="phparch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="phpmagazine"/&gt;
* Schema definition files are automatically generated from the visual model&lt;ref name="jic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="phparch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="phpmagazine"/&gt;
* Visual representation uses [[ER diagram]] extended by concepts of [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|inheritance]] and [[Many-to-many (data model)|many-to-many]]&lt;ref name="jic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="phparch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="phpmagazine"/&gt;
* Supports customization using .xml configuration files and JavaScript&lt;ref name="jic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://help.orm-designer.com/en/extending-orm-attributes |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610104119/http://help.orm-designer.com/en/extending-orm-attributes |archivedate=2014-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://help.orm-designer.com/en/extending-scripts |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223135052/http://help.orm-designer.com/en/extending-scripts |archivedate=2014-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Does not support direct connections to the database&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://help.orm-designer.com/en/mysql-workbench |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419204544/http://help.orm-designer.com/en/mysql-workbench |archivedate=2014-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Crude and simplistic visual representation and menus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stacktrace.dev-krtcs.net/2013/04/05/orm-designer/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221205201/http://stacktrace.dev-krtcs.net/2013/04/05/orm-designer/ |archivedate=2014-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
'''Skipper''' was built on the [[Qt (framework)|Qt framework]]. Import/export of the schema definitions uses [[XSLT|XSL]] transformations powered by [[LibXslt]] library. Imported source files are first converted to XML format: no conversion for XML, simple conversion for YML, creating the [[Abstract Syntax Tree]] and its subsequent conversion to XML for PHP annotations.
The import/export scripts are configured in JavaScript and can be freely customized.&lt;ref name="insides"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.orm-designer.com/2014/01/magic-behind-orm-designer/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426002150/http://blog.orm-designer.com/2014/01/magic-behind-orm-designer/ |archivedate=2014-04-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
'''Skipper''' was created as an internal tool for the web applications developed by Inventic. It was first published as a commercial tool under the name '''ORM Designer''' in 2009.&lt;ref name="internal"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.orm-designer.com/2009/12/new-tool-orm-designer/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223135048/http://blog.orm-designer.com/2009/12/new-tool-orm-designer/ |archivedate=2014-02-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goaleurope"&gt;[http://goaleurope.com/2013/08/21/czech-orm-designer-raises-funding-from-angel-investor/ goaleurope.com/ORM-Designer-raises-funding-from-angel-investor]&lt;/ref&gt;
Application was reworked and optimized in January 2013, and released as '''ORM Designer 2'''.&lt;ref name="insides"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://byznys.ihned.cz/c1-60215550-mladi-programatori-z-brna-zdrazili-svuj-software-trojnasobne-prodeje-zustaly-stejne&lt;/ref&gt;
In May 2013 ORM Designer became part of the South Moravian Innovation Center Incubator program (support program for innovative technological startups).&lt;ref name="goaleurope"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tyinternety.cz/2013/03/12/clanek/do-jic-innovation-parku-se-hlasi-41-firem-nejlepsi-vyberou-rostock-vsiansky-a-berdar/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jic.cz/companies-in-the-jic-innovation-park#inventic&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2014, ORM Designer version 3 was released and rebranded under the name of Skipper&lt;ref name="rebrand"/&gt;

The '''[[Syracuse University]] School of Information Studies''', also known as the '''iSchool''', is a center for research and education in the policy, systems, service, and technology aspects of [[information management]], [[information science]], and [[library science]]. Established in 1896 as the School of Library Science, its name was changed in 1974 to reflect the growing information field.  Syracuse was the first library school to change its name in this way,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Gary|last2=Grudin|first2=Jonathan|year=2009|title=TIMELINES The information school phenomenon|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1487632.1487636#|journal=Interactions|volume=16|issue=2|pages=15–19|doi=10.1145/1487632.1487636}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence its claim as "the ''original'' school for the information age."  Starting in the 1970s, the school began to add new programs focused on information studies that aim to merge technology and management skills with an emphasis on human needs and behavior.

== History ==
The first library science courses were offered at Syracuse University in 1896 at the University’s [[von Ranke]] library, with university librarian Henry Orrin Sibley and his wife as the first and only instructors.  In 1907, the program moved to the University's Carnegie Library, and, in 1908, it received accreditation from the American Library Association. The program eventually split from the College of Liberal Arts in 1915 and began granting graduate degrees in 1934.

The School of Information Studies emerged in 1974 when Dean Robert Taylor suggested the School of Library Science adopt a name that would signal a new direction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Throughout the 1970s, he updated the library science curriculum to keep pace with the changing times. In 1977, the [[Education Resources Information Center]] (ERIC/AE) Clearinghouse was launched at the school.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/e/eric_ae.htm], ERIC Clearinghouse on Adult Education (ERIC/AE) at Syracuse University.&lt;/ref&gt; The country’s first master's degree in information resources management (IRM) was added to the curriculum in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.acm.org/education/education/curric_vols/is2002.pdf|title=IS 2002 Model Curriculum and Guidelines for Undergraduate Degree Programs in Information Systems|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611040945/http://www.acm.org/education/education/curric_vols/is2002.pdf|archivedate=2017-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1980s marked an increase in faculty research and grants that established the School of Information Studies as a leader in the field.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} During this time, the undergraduate program in information management and technology was introduced. In 1983, the school moved from its old home in several large houses on the edge of campus to Huntington Hall. The school's offices and classrooms moved again in 1989 to the Center for Science and Technology, which also housed the Chemistry and Computer Science programs, among others.

The 1990s brought many innovations to the school, including the master's degree program in telecommunications and network management; [[AskERIC]], one of the first [[digital reference services]]; and [[distance learning]] options for graduate study.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Several new research centers opened, including the Convergence Center, the Center for [[Electronic commerce|Digital Commerce]], and the Center for [[Natural Language Processing]].

As the new millennium approached, the school had outgrown its space in the Center for Science and Technology. Dean Raymond von Dran began working toward establishing a new home for the iSchool on campus, announcing his vision for the school's permanent home on the Syracuse University Quad. In 2008, von Dran's vision was realized when the School of Information Studies celebrated the iOpening of a completely redesigned Hinds Hall. The building, with its sleek and modern design, earned the [[American Institute of Architects]] [[Central New York]] Chapter Citation Award that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ischool.syr.edu/newsroom/news.aspx?recid=583|title=Hinds Hall renovations win AIA CNY design award|last=|first=|accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Curriculum ==
The School of Information Studies offers an undergraduate degree, four master's degrees, and two doctoral degrees, as well as several certificates of advanced study.

* The Bachelor of Science in Information Management and Technology focuses on information systems and personal services. It prepares graduates for careers in data administration, database management, systems analysis, web design and development, and consulting.
* The Master of Science in Information Management for Executives is for students with six or more years of appropriate full-time professional experience in the information management field and who demonstrate appropriate professional qualifications may apply into the Master of Science in Information Management: Executive Track.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3063">The [[idiom]] '''tongue-in-cheek''' refers to a humorous or sarcastic statement expressed in a mock serious manner.

==History==
The phrase originally expressed contempt, but by 1842 had acquired its modern meaning.&lt;ref name=owens/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Contrastive metaphor of Korean and English revealed in 'mouth' and 'tongue' expressions |first=H. | last=Chay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Use Your Body |first =I. G. |last= Zoltan |journal=Philologia |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early users of the phrase include [[Sir Walter Scott]] in his 1828 ''[[The Fair Maid of Perth]]''.

The physical act of putting one's [[tongue]] into one's [[cheek]] once signified contempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=From the Horse's Mouth |first=John |last=Ayto |publisher=Oxford University Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BC8_tRvBSvsC&amp; |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-19-954379-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Tobias Smollett]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Roderick Random]],'' which was published in 1748, the eponymous hero takes a coach to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], and on the way, apprehends a [[highwayman]]. This provokes an altercation with a less brave passenger:
{{quote|He looked back and pronounced with a faltering voice, 'O! 'tis very well—damn my blood! I shall find a time.'  I signified my contempt of him by thrusting my tongue in my cheek, which humbled him so much, that he scarce swore another oath aloud during the whole journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ld8kAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA200 |title=The adventures of Roderick Random | first=Tobias George |last=Smollett |year=1780}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The phrase appears in 1828 in ''[[The Fair Maid of Perth]]'' by [[Sir Walter Scott]]: 
{{quote|The fellow who gave this all-hail thrust his tongue in his cheek to some [[:wikt:scapegrace|scapegrace]]s like himself.}}

It's not clear how Scott intended readers to understand the phrase.&lt;ref name=owens&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsok.com/article/3176644/1196722011 |title='Tongue in cheek' is cut-and-dried phrase|date=4 December 2007 |work=The Oklahoman|first=Gene |last= Owens | quote=... Novelist Sir Walter Scott used 'tongue in cheek' as early as 1828 in 'The Fair Maid of Perth,' but it isn't clear what he meant. |publisher= Phrases.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; The more modern [[irony|ironic]] sense appears in the 1842 poem "[[The Ingoldsby Legends]]" by the English clergyman [[Richard Barham]], in which a Frenchman inspects a watch and cries:
{{quote|'' 'Superbe!  Magnifique!' '' / (with his tongue in his cheek)&lt;ref name=owens/&gt;}}

The ironic usage originates with the idea of suppressed mirth&amp;mdash;biting one's tongue to prevent an outburst of laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AEL0XOWn0sEC&amp;pg=PA37 |title=The body language phrasebook |first=Nick |last=Marshallsay |publisher= Collins &amp; Brown |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-84340-304-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13849">In [[archaeology]] a '''typology''' is the result of the [[Categorization|classification]] of things according to their physical characteristics. The products of the classification, i.e. the classes, are also called types. Most archaeological typologies organize portable [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] into types, but typologies of larger structures, including buildings, [[Ancient monument|field monuments]], [[fortification]]s or roads, are equally possible. A typology helps to manage a large mass of archaeological data. According to Doran and Hodson, "this superficially straightforward task has proved one of the most time consuming and contentious aspects of archaeological research".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Doran |first1=J.E. |last2=Hodson |first2=F.R. |year=1975 |title=Mathematics and Computers in Archaeology |place=Edinburgh |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |ISBN=0-85224-250-6 |page=158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical background==
Typology is based on a view of the world familiar from [[Plato]]'s [[metaphysics]] called [[essentialism]]. Essentialism is the idea that the world is divided into real, discontinuous and immutable ‘kinds’. This idea is the basis for most typological constructions, particularly of stone artefacts where essential forms are often thought of as ‘mental templates’, or combinations of traits that are favoured by the maker. Variation in artifact form and attributes is seen as a consequence of the imperfect realization of the template, and is usually attributed to differences in raw material properties or individuals' technical competences.

==History==
Although the principles were not clearly articulated, the application of basic typological techniques can occasionally be found in the work of [[Early modern period|early modern]] [[Antiquarian|antiquaries]]. As early as the 1530s, [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] successfully identified [[Roman brick]]s (under the misleading designation "Briton brykes") at several different sites, distinguishing them from more modern bricks by size and shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=Oliver |title=John Leland and the 'Briton Brykes' |journal=Antiquaries Journal |volume=87 |year=2007 |pages=346–56 |doi=10.1017/s0003581500000949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antiquaries began to recognise in the late 16th century that medieval [[English church monuments|monumental effigies]] represented with their legs crossed were likely to be older than those with straight legs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harris |first=O.D. |title=Antiquarian attitudes: crossed legs, crusaders and the evolution of an idea |journal=Antiquaries Journal |volume=90 |year=2010 |pages=401–40 |doi=10.1017/s0003581510000053}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 17th century, [[John Aubrey]] worked out crude evolutionary sequences based on typological distinctions for medieval architecture, handwriting, shield-shapes and costume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hunter |first=Michael |title=John Aubrey and the Realm of Learning |place=London |year=1975 |pages=156–7, 162–6, 181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Colvin |first=H.M. |chapter=Aubrey’s 'Chronologia Architectonica' |editor-first=John |editor-last=Summerson |title=Concerning Architecture |place=London |year=1968 |pages=1–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Olivia |last=Horsfall Turner |authorlink=Olivia Horsfall Turner |title='The Windows of this Church are of several Fashions': architectural form and historical method in John Aubrey's 'Chronologia Architectonica'|journal=Architectural History |volume=54 |year=2011 |pages=171–93 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The outline of the development of medieval [[Gothic architecture]] was further refined in the 18th century, culminating in the clear sequence of styles published by [[Thomas Rickman]] in 1817.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Frankl |first=P. |title=The Gothic: literary sources and interpretations through eight centuries |place=Princeton |year=1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Watkin |first=D. |title=The Rise of Architectural History |place=London |year=1980 |pages=53–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=M. |title=Thomas Gray’s contribution to the study of medieval architecture |journal=Architectural History |volume=36 |year=1993 |pages=49–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th and early 20th centuries archaeological typologies continued to be constructed using a combination of empirical observation and intuition. According to Eggers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eggers |first=Hans-Jürgen |year=1986 |title=Einführung in die Vorgeschichte |place=München |publisher=Piper Verlag |pages=88–95 |ISBN=3-492-00393-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most archaeologists give [[Oscar Montelius]] the credit for the first serious application of the typological method, but in Eggers' view, his contemporary colleague from Stockholm, Hans Hildebrand made important contributions to the development of the methodology as well. Hildebrand published a fundamental paper on the development of [[fibulae]] in the 1870s using the typological method, whereas Montelius at the same time went to international congresses and published smaller papers on this method.

Another early example is the typology published in 1899 by [[Flinders Petrie]] for the objects (mainly pottery) found in 900 prehistoric Egyptian graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kendall |first=D.G. |year=1971 |chapter=Seriation from abundance matrices |title=Mathematics in the Archaeological and Historical Sciences |editor1-first=F.R. |editor1-last=Hodson |editor2-first=D.G. |editor2-last=Kendall |editor3-first=P. |editor3-last=Tautu |pages=215–252 |place=Edinburgh |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |ISBN=0-85224-213-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This typology formed the basis for his manual [[Seriation (archaeology)|seriation]] of the graves.

==Statistical methods for creating a typology==
With the development of [[statistics|statistical]] techniques and numerical [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] in the 1960s, mathematical methods (including [[Cluster analysis]], [[Principal components analysis]], [[correspondence analysis]] and [[Factor analysis]]) have been used to build typologies. These techniques provide a qualitative way to articulate the degrees of consistency among particular attributes. Correlation coefficients created by these methods help archaeologists discern between meaningful and useless similarities between artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Spaulding, Albert C|title=Statistical Techniques for the Discovery of Artifact Types|date=1953|publisher=American Antiquity|volume=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s [[archaeologist]]s began to use [[phylogenetic]] methods borrowed from [[Cladistics]].

==Ceramic typology==
For cultures that produced pottery, archaeologists invariably spend a great deal of time defining ceramic "types." Each type is a series of attributes which distinguishes one group of pottery (whether whole vessels or potsherds) from all other groups of pottery, such that each type was produced in a single time and place. Ideally, the attributes used to identify types are ones that are identifiable with the naked eye, and are found on small fragments of pottery, so that the sorting of potsherds into types is quick and straightforward. By sorting potsherds in terms of types, archaeologists can examine a series of potsherds (including those lying on a site surface) and quickly suggest when and where the pottery was made. By extension, they can estimate when a prehistoric site was used, whether there are any traded pieces, and so on.

The names assigned to the ceramic types are arbitrary. In United States, the common practice is a two-part name, the first part being an arbitrary geographic reference and the second part providing a brief description of the pottery's most obvious design attributes. Thus, for example, the type "Flagstaff Black-on-white" was first defined using a collection from the vicinity of Flagstaff, Arizona, and its primary design attribute is the use of black paint on a white background.

Non-archaeologists should be aware of the limitations of ceramic typology. All such typologies are abstractions, and fail to describe all of the variability in an artistic tradition. Professional disagreement over specifics is common. Changes in ceramic design did not happen overnight, and archaeological typologies tend to break continua of design evolution into arbitrary (but highly useful) units. Most archaeological dates are approximate.

==Non-archaeological typology as an art form==
In the middle of the twentieth century, German photographers [[Bernd and Hilla Becher]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/026202277X Bernd and Hilla Becher, ''Water Towers'', The MIT Press, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt; raised typology to an art form by photographing countless similar architectural features including water towers, workers' houses and industrial landscapes.

== Types of typologies ==
''There are four main types of typologies that archaeologists organize artifacts into.''

=== Morphological/descriptive typology ===
One class of typology consists of a descriptive or [http://www.archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?terms=typology a morphological] approach. It is based on the physical characteristics and the external features of an artifact. Some examples of  morphological and descriptive typologies would be categorizing artifacts distinctively on their weight, height, color, material, or whichever class the individual decides upon.

==== Projectile point typology ====
An example of morphological/descriptive typology consists of when an archaeologist excavates a site and finds dozens upon dozens of Native American arrowheads. The archaeologist narrows down their classification by organizing the pieces into morphological/descriptive groups. So, the [[projectile point]]s could be sorted by weight, height, color, material, or however the archaeologists prefers. One of the first national typology bases available on the web, [http://www.projectilepoints.net/Search/Search.html The Projectile Points Typology Database] , exhibits how the arrowhead artifacts found are classified among the fifty states by region, state, or nationwide.

In this particular example, the arrowheads are classified by their shape. The categories consist of: notched, stemmed, lanceolate, and other projectile points. Each category may also be narrowed down into subsequent ones.
[[File:ProjPointTerm.jpg|thumb|An example of morphological/descriptive typology. Archaeologist classified these arrowheads based on the projectile point shape.]]

=== Chronological typology ===
This type consists of sequential ordering of archaeological artifacts merely based on form. It involves collecting dates or relative dates that establishes the position in time the artifact lies in to reflect the civilization/events of a current region &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.archaeologywordsmith.com/lookup.php?terms=typology|title = Archaeology Wordsmith|website = www.archaeologywordsmith.com|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Chronology|chronological]] typology is made up of diagnostic artifacts, or relics that suggests a particular event/people occurred during a period of time &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.wvculture.org/shpo/glossary.html|title = Glossary of Archaeology Terms|website = www.wvculture.org|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [https://www.jefpat.org/diagnostic/Post-Colonial%20Ceramics/PaintedWares/index-paintedwares.htm underglaze painted earthenwares] for an example of chronological typology.

=== Functional typology ===
Artifacts organized into this kind of typology are sorted by the use they serve rather than the looks they have or the chronological sequence they possess.  In some cases, the artifacts may not be removed because of the functional purpose they exhibit, and the restoration of the pieces can be more difficult than other types of objects &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.venipedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=Functional_Artifacts|title = Functional Artifacts - Venipedia|website = www.venipedia.org|access-date = 2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stylistic typology ===
This type of classification displays information about the artifact via the object's display. Stylistic typology is not to be confused with classification of certain styles, for that would just entail organizing artifacts based on how they look. This type of typology accounts for information told through the artifact. [[Pottery]] is an example of a stylistic typology because the artifacts provide information on artistic evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=abDhtdHFyCkC|title = Archaeological Typology and Practical Reality: A Dialectical Approach to Artifact Classification and Sorting|last = Adams|first = William Y.|last2 = Adams|first2 = Ernest W.|date = 2007-11-26|publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 9780521048675|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vellum''' is prepared animal skin or "membrane" used as a material for writing on. The term is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''vitulinum'' meaning "made from calf", leading to [[Old French]] ''velin'' for "calfskin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=vellum|title=vellum|publisher=Online Etymological Dictionary|accessdate=2014-08-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904202532/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=vellum|archive-date=2014-09-04|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Parchment]] is another term for this material category.  If vellum is distinguished, it is by vellum being made from calf skin, as opposed to that from other animals,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.archives.gov/preservation/formats/paper-vellum.html | title=Differences between Parchment, Vellum and Paper | website=archives.gov | access-date=2016-06-16 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615030013/http://www.archives.gov/preservation/formats/paper-vellum.html | archive-date=2016-06-15 | dead-url=no | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or otherwise being of higher quality.&lt;ref name="esdaile"&gt;Stokes and Almagno 2001, 114&lt;/ref&gt;  Vellum is prepared as a surface for writing (or printing) to produce scrolls, single pages, [[Codex|codices]] or books. 

Modern scholars and custodians increasingly use only the safe, if confusing, term "membrane".&lt;ref name="esdaile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c&amp;g9"&gt;Clemens and Graham 2007, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on factors such as the method of preparation it may be very hard to determine the animal species involved (let alone its age) without using a laboratory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Anthony |last=Cains |chapter=The surface examination of skin: a binder's note on the identification of animal species used in the making of parchment |title=The Book of Kells: proceedings of a conference at Trinity College Dublin, 6–9 September 1992 |editor-first=Felicity |editor-last=O'Mahony |publisher=Scolar Press |place=Aldershot |year=1994 |isbn=0-85967-967-5 |pages=172–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term avoids the need to distinguish between vellum and parchment.&lt;ref name="esdaile"/&gt;&lt;ref name="c&amp;g9"/&gt;

Vellum is generally smooth and durable, although there are great variations depending on preparation and the quality of the skin. The manufacture involves the cleaning, bleaching, stretching on a frame (a "herse"), and scraping of the skin with a crescent-shaped knife (a "lunarium" or "lunellum"). To create tension, scraping is alternated with wetting and drying. A final finish may be achieved by abrading the surface with [[pumice]], and treating with a preparation of lime or chalk to make it accept writing or printing ink.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Modern "paper vellum" is a made of synthetic plant material, and is called such for its usage and quality similarities. Paper vellum is used for a variety of purposes including tracing, technical drawings, plans and [[blueprint]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Drafting, 60-61&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Japanese_vellum|title=Japanese vellum - CAMEO|website=cameo.mfa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903010241/http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Japanese_vellum|archive-date=2017-09-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.americanstationery.com/blog/how-modern-day-vellum-stationery-is-produced/|title=How Modern Day Vellum Stationery is Produced|date=2011-07-04|work=The Note Pad {{!}} Stationery &amp; Party Etiquette Blog by American Stationery|access-date=2017-09-03|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903010030/http://www.americanstationery.com/blog/how-modern-day-vellum-stationery-is-produced/|archive-date=2017-09-03|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
In Europe, from Roman times, the term "vellum" was used for the best quality of prepared skin, regardless of the animal from which the hide was obtained, [[calfskin|calf]], [[Sheepskin (material)|sheep]], and [[kidskin|goat]] all being commonly used (other animals, including pig, deer, donkey, horse, or camel have been used). Although the term derives from the French for "calf", animal vellum can include hide from virtually any other mammal. The best quality, "uterine vellum",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Houston|first1=Keith|title=The Book: A Cover-to-Cover Exploration of the Most Powerful Object of Our Time|date=2016|publisher=[[W.W. Norton &amp; Company]]|isbn=978-0-393-24479-3|url=https://blog.longreads.com/2016/12/01/hidebound-the-grisly-invention-of-parchment/|accessdate=2 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161202124352/https://blog.longreads.com/2016/12/01/hidebound-the-grisly-invention-of-parchment/|archive-date=2016-12-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was said to be made from the skins of [[stillbirth|stillborn]] or unborn animals, although the term was also applied to fine quality skins made from young animals.&lt;ref name="esdaile"/&gt; There has long been, however, much blurring of the boundaries between these terms. In 1519, [[William Horman]] could write in his ''Vulgaria'': "That stouffe that we wrytte upon, and is made of beestis skynnes, is somtyme called parchement, somtyme velem, somtyme abortyve, somtyme membraan."&lt;ref&gt;William Horman, ''Vulgaria'' (1519), fol. 80v; cited in Ustick 1936, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1936, Lee Ustick explained that:
{{quote|To-day the distinction, among collectors of manuscripts, is that ''vellum'' is a highly refined form of skin, ''parchment'' a cruder form, usually thick, harsh, less highly polished than vellum, but with no distinction between skin of calf, or sheep, or of goat.&lt;ref&gt;Ustick 1936, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

French sources, closer to the original etymology, tend to define ''velin'' as from calf only, while the [[British Standards Institution]] defines parchment as made from the split skin of several species, and vellum from the unsplit skin.&lt;ref&gt;Young, Laura, A., ''Bookbinding &amp; conservation by hand: a working guide'', Oak Knoll Press, 1995, {{ISBN|1-884718-11-6}}, {{ISBN|978-1-884718-11-3}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=G7tUPQdT2hcC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=sheep+vellum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Op-7E6tE48&amp;sig=jX7CogBbfQLEvoXSj1Xz2R5xCRg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hfyOSvfFFc2hjAfb17n8DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=onepage&amp;q=sheep%20vellum&amp;f=false Google books] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118132433/https://books.google.com/books?id=G7tUPQdT2hcC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=sheep+vellum&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Op-7E6tE48&amp;sig=jX7CogBbfQLEvoXSj1Xz2R5xCRg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hfyOSvfFFc2hjAfb17n8DQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=onepage&amp;q=sheep%20vellum&amp;f=false |date=2017-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the usage of modern practitioners of the artistic crafts of writing, illuminating, lettering, and bookbinding, "vellum" is normally reserved for calfskin, while any other skin is called "parchment".&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Johnston|Johnston, E.]] (1906 et seq.) ''Writing, Illuminating, and Lettering''; Lamb, C.M. (ed.)(1956) ''The Calligrapher's Handbook''; and publications of [[Society of Scribes &amp; Illuminators]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacture==

Vellum is a translucent material produced from the skin, often split, of a young animal. The skin is washed with water and lime ([[Calcium hydroxide]]), but not together. It is then soaked in lime for several days to soften and remove the hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Once clear, the two sides of the skin are distinct: the side facing inside the animal and the hair side. The "inside body side" of the skin is usually the lighter and more refined of the two. The hair follicles may be visible on the outer side, together with any scarring made while the animal was alive. The membrane can also show the pattern of the animal's vein network called the "veining" of the sheet.&lt;ref name="Codex"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://codexsinaiticus.org/en/project/conservation_physDesc.aspx |title="Recording the physical features of Codex Sinaiticus". ''Codex Sinaiticus'', in partnership with the British Library |access-date=2012-04-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501201624/http://codexsinaiticus.org/en/project/conservation_physDesc.aspx |archive-date=2012-05-01 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any remaining hair is removed ("scudding") and the skin is dried by attaching it to a frame (a "herse").&lt;ref name="c&amp;g11"&gt;Clemens and Graham 2007, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The skin is attached at points around the circumference with cords; to prevent tearing, the maker wraps the area of the skin to which the cord is to be attached around a pebble (a "pippin").&lt;ref name="c&amp;g11"/&gt; The maker then uses a crescent shaped knife, (a "lunarium" or "lunellum"), to clean off any remaining hairs.

Once the skin is completely dry, it is thoroughly cleaned and processed into sheets. The number of sheets extracted from the piece of skin depends on the size of the skin and the given dimensions requested by the order. For example, the average calfskin can provide three and half medium sheets of writing material. This can be doubled when it is folded into two conjoint leaves, also known as a bifolium. Historians have found evidence of manuscripts where the scribe wrote down the medieval instructions now followed by modern membrane makers.&lt;ref name="daniel"&gt;Thompson, Daniel. "Medieval Parchment-Making". The Library 16, no. 4 (1935).&lt;/ref&gt; The membrane is then rubbed with a round, flat object ("pouncing") to ensure that the ink would adhere well.&lt;ref name="Codex"/&gt;

==Manuscripts==
[[File:Treatises On Natural Science, Philosophy, And Mathematics - Planets.jpg|thumb|right|225px|''A Volume Of Treatises On Natural Science, Philosophy, And Mathematics'' (1300) Ink on vellum.]]

===Preparing manuscripts===
Once the vellum is prepared, traditionally a [[paper quire|quire]] is formed of a group of several sheets. Raymond Clemens and Timothy Graham point out, in their ''Introduction to Manuscript Studies'', that "the quire was the scribe's basic writing unit throughout the Middle Ages".&lt;ref&gt;Clemens and Graham 2007, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Guidelines are then made on the membrane. They note "'pricking' is the process of making holes in a sheet of parchment (or membrane) in preparation of its ruling. The lines were then made by ruling between the prick marks...The process of entering ruled lines on the page to serve as a guide for entering text. Most manuscripts were ruled with horizontal lines that served as the baselines on which the text was entered and with vertical bounding lines that marked the boundaries of the columns".&lt;ref&gt;Clemens and Graham 2007, pp. 15–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage===
Most of the finer sort of medieval manuscripts, whether [[Illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] or not, were written on vellum. Some [[Gandharan Buddhist texts]] were written on vellum, and all [[Sifrei Torah]] (Hebrew: ספר תורה Sefer Torah; plural: ספרי תורה, Sifrei Torah) are written on [[kosher]] [[klaf]] or vellum.

A quarter of the 180 copy edition of [[Johannes Gutenberg]]'s first [[Gutenberg Bible|Bible]] printed in 1455 with [[movable type]] was also printed on vellum, presumably because his market expected this for a high-quality book. Paper was used for most book-printing, as it was cheaper and easier to process through a [[printing press]] and [[bookbinding|bind]].

In art, vellum was used for paintings, especially if they needed to be sent long distances, before [[canvas]] became widely used in about 1500, and continued to be used for drawings, and [[watercolour]]s. [[Old master print]]s were sometimes printed on vellum, especially for presentation copies, until at least the seventeenth century.

[[Limp vellum]] or limp-parchment bindings were used frequently in the 16th and 17th centuries, and were sometimes [[Gilding|gilt]] but were also often not [[embellishment|embellished]]. In later centuries vellum has been more commonly used like leather, that is, as the covering for stiff board bindings. Vellum can be stained virtually any color but seldom is, as a great part of its beauty and appeal rests in its faint grain and hair markings, as well as its warmth and simplicity.

Lasting in excess of 1,000 years&amp;mdash;[[Gregory the Great, Pastoral Care (Troyes, Bibliothèque Municipale, MS 504)]], for example dates from about 600 and is in excellent condition&amp;mdash;animal vellum can be far more durable than paper. For this reason, many important documents are written on animal vellum, such as diplomas. Referring to a diploma as a "sheepskin" alludes to the time when diplomas were written on vellum made from animal hides.

===Modern usage===
British [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] are still printed on vellum for archival purposes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Goat skin tradition wins the day | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | date = 1999-11-02 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/502342.stm | access-date = 2016-02-11 | quote = Acts of Parliament dating back to 1497 recorded on vellum are currently held in the House of Lords Public Record Office | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080409112147/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/502342.stm | archive-date = 2008-04-09 | dead-url = no | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; as are those of the [[Republic of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2FFAQ%2Fdocument1.htm | title = Frequently Asked Questions about the Houses of the Oireachtas - Tithe an Oireachtais | website = [[Oireachtas]] | access-date = 2016-02-11 | quote = Once a Bill has been passed by both Houses, the Taoiseach presents a vellum copy of the Bill, prepared in the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas to the President for signature and promulgation as law. | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/671a1xfLj?url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/viewdoc.asp?fn=%2Fdocuments%2FFAQ%2Fdocument1.htm | archive-date = 2012-04-18 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2016, the UK [[House of Lords]] announced that legislation would be printed on archive paper instead of the traditional vellum from April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hughes | first = Laura | title = Thousand year old tradition of printing Britain's laws on vellum has been scrapped to save just £80,000 | newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 2016-02-09 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/12149181/Thousand-year-old-tradition-of-printing-Britains-laws-on-vellum-has-been-scrapped-to-save-just-80000.html | access-date = 2016-02-11 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160212064333/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/12149181/Thousand-year-old-tradition-of-printing-Britains-laws-on-vellum-has-been-scrapped-to-save-just-80000.html | archive-date = 2016-02-12 | dead-url = no | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Minister for the Cabinet Office|Cabinet Office Minister]] [[Matthew Hancock]] intervened by agreeing to fund the continued use of vellum from the [[Cabinet Office]] budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hughes | first = Laura | title = Vellum should be saved in a bid to 'safeguard our great traditions', says minister | newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 2016-02-14 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/12149181/Thousand-year-old-tradition-of-printing-Britains-laws-on-vellum-has-been-scrapped-to-save-just-80000.html | access-date = 2016-02-15 | quote = Mr Hancock told The Daily Telegraph: 'Recording our laws on vellum is a millennium long tradition, and surprisingly cost effective.

Today, because of low demand and complicated manufacturing process, animal vellum is expensive and hard to find. The only UK company still producing traditional parchment and vellum is William Cowley (established 1870), which is based in [[Newport Pagnell]], [[Buckinghamshire]]. A modern imitation is made of [[cotton]]. Known as paper vellum, this material is considerably cheaper than animal vellum and can be found in most art and drafting supply stores. Some brands of [[writing paper]] and other sorts of paper use the term "vellum" to suggest quality.

Vellum is still used for Jewish scrolls, of the [[Torah]] in particular, for luxury book-binding, [[memorial book]]s, and for various documents in [[calligraphy]].  It is also used on instruments such as the [[banjo]] and the [[bodhran]], although synthetic skins are also available for these instruments.

==Paper vellum==
Modern imitation vellum is made from plasticized rag cotton or fibers from interior tree bark. Terms include: paper vellum, Japanese vellum, and vegetable vellum.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Paper vellum is usually translucent and its various [[Paper size|sizes]] are often used in applications where tracing is required, such as [[architectural plan]]s.  It is more dimensionally stable than a linen or paper sheet, which is frequently critical in the development of large scaled drawings such as [[blueprint]]s. Paper vellum had also become extremely important in hand or chemical reproduction technology for dissemination of plan copies. Like a high-quality traditional vellum, paper vellum could be produced thin enough to be virtually [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] to strong light, enabling a source drawing to be used directly in the reproduction of field-used drawings.&lt;ref&gt;Drafting, 60-61; Yee, Rendow, ''Architectural Drawing: A Visual Compendium of Types and Methods'', 4th edition, 2012, John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|1118310446}}, 781118310441, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hphgl8Tu1HEC&amp;pg=PT1532 google]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
{{refimprove|date=August 2014}}
Vellum is ideally stored in a stable environment with constant temperature and 30%&amp;nbsp;(±&amp;nbsp;5%) [[relative humidity]]. If vellum is stored in an environment with less than 11% relative humidity, it becomes fragile, brittle, and susceptible to [[mechanical stress]]es; if it is stored in an environment with greater than 40% relative humidity, it becomes vulnerable to gelation and to [[mold]] or [[fungus]] growth.&lt;ref&gt;Eric F. Hansen and Steve N. Lee, "The Effects of Relative Humidity on Some Physical Properties of Modern Vellum: Implications for the Optimum Relative Humidity for the Display and Storage of Parchment", ''The Book and Paper Group Annual'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The optimal temperature for the preservation of vellum is {{convert|20|+/-|1.5|°C|°F|sigfig=2}}.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

{{Intelligent Design}}

The '''watchmaker analogy''' or '''watchmaker argument''' is a [[teleological argument]] which states, by way of an [[analogy]], that a design implies a designer. The analogy has played a prominent role in [[natural theology]] and the "argument from design," where it was used to support arguments for the existence of [[God]] and for the [[intelligent design]] of the universe, in both [[Christianity]] and [[Deism]].

[[Sir Isaac Newton]], among other leaders in the scientific revolution, including [[René Descartes]], upheld "that the physical laws he had uncovered revealed the mechanical perfection of the workings of the universe to be akin to a watch, wherein the watchmaker is God."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 1859 publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[scientific theory|theory]] of [[natural selection]] put forward an explanation for complexity and [[adaptation]], which reflects scientific consensus on the origins of biological diversity.&lt;ref name="nap"&gt;"Such controversies as do exist concern the details of the mechanisms of evolution, not the validity of the over-arching theory of evolution, which is one of the best supported theories in all of science." [http://www.nap.edu/books/0309064066/html/25.html Science and Creationism: A View from the National Academy of Sciences, Second Edition] [[United States National Academy of Sciences]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the eyes of some, this provided a counter-argument to the watchmaker analogy: for example, the [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] referred to the analogy in his 1986 book ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' giving his explanation of [[evolution]]. Others, however, consider the watchmaker analogy to be compatible with [[evolutionary creation]], opining that the two concepts are not mutually exclusive. In the 19th century, [[deists]], who championed the watchmaker analogy, held that Darwin's theory fit with "the principle of [[uniformitarianism]]—the idea that all processes in the world occur now as they have in the past" and that [[deistic evolution]] "provided an explanatory framework for understanding species variation in a mechanical universe."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the United States, starting in the 1960s, [[creationism|creationists]] revived versions of the argument to dispute the concepts of evolution and natural selection, and there was renewed interest in the watchmaker argument. The most famous statement of this teleological [[argument]] using the watchmaker analogy was given by [[William Paley]] in his 1802 book ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmcarey.edu/carey/paley/ William Paley - William Carey University]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Scientific revolution===
The [[scientific revolution]] "nurtured a growing awareness" that "there were universal laws of nature at work that ordered the movement of the world and its parts." [[James K. A. Smith]] and [[Amos Yong]] write that in "astronomy, the Copernican revolution regarding the heliocentrism of the solar system, Johannes Kepler's (1571–1630) three laws of planetary motion, and Isaac Newton's (1642–1727) law of universal gravitation—laws of gravitation and of motion, and notions of absolute space and time—all combined to establish the regularities of heavenly and earthly bodies." With such a backdrop, "deists suggested the watchmaker analogy: just as watches are set in motion by watchmakers, after which they operate according to their pre-established mechanisms, so also was the world begun by the God as creator, after which it and all its parts have operated according to their pre-established natural laws. With these laws perfectly in place, events have unfolded according to the prescribed plan."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=James K. A.|title=Science and the Spirit|year=2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-00466-7|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Sir Isaac Newton]], "the regular motion of the planets made it reasonable to believe in the continued existence of God."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garrett|first=Brian|title=What is this thing called Metaphysics?|year=2007|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=0-203-96844-1|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton also upheld the idea that "like a watchmaker, God was forced to intervene in the universe and tinker with the mechanism from time to time to ensure that it continued operating in good working order." Like Newton, [[René Descartes]] viewed "the cosmos as a great time machine operating according to fixed laws, a watch created and wound up by the great watchmaker."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=McMahan|first=David L.|title=The Making of Buddhist Modernism|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-988478-1|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===William Paley===
{{main|William Paley|Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity}}

Watches and timepieces have been used as examples of complicated technology in philosophical discussions. For example, [[Cicero]], [[Voltaire]] and [[René Descartes]] all used timepieces in arguments regarding purpose. The watchmaker analogy, as described here, was used by [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]] in 1686,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jCFmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22the+situation+by+pointing+out%22+watch&amp;dq=%22the+situation+by+pointing+out%22+watch|title=Will and Ariel Durant, the age of Louis XIV (1963)|first=|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1935|isbn=|location=|pages=Section V, FONTENELLE: 1657–1757|quote=|via=|author1=Durant, Will |author2=Durant, Ariel}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was most famously formulated by Paley.

Paley used the watchmaker analogy in his book ''[[Natural Theology or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity|Natural Theology, or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity collected from the Appearances of Nature]]'', published in 1802. In it, Paley wrote that if a [[pocket watch]] is found on a heath, it is most reasonable to assume that someone dropped it and that it was made by at least one watchmaker, not by natural forces:

[[Image:WilliamPaley.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Paley]]]]
{{Quote|In crossing a heath, suppose I pitched my foot against a stone, and were asked how the stone came to be there; I might possibly answer, that, for anything I knew to the contrary, it had lain there forever: nor would it perhaps be very easy to show the absurdity of this answer. But suppose I had found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place; I should hardly think of the answer I had before given, that for anything I knew, the watch might have always been there.&amp;nbsp;... There must have existed, at some time, and at some place or other, an artificer or artificers, who formed [the watch] for the purpose which we find it actually to answer; who comprehended its construction, and designed its use.&amp;nbsp;... Every indication of contrivance, every manifestation of design, which existed in the watch, exists in the works of nature; with the difference, on the side of nature, of being greater or more, and that in a degree which exceeds all computation. |William Paley|Natural Theology (1802)}}

Paley went on to argue that the complex structures of living things and the remarkable adaptations of plants and animals required an intelligent designer. He believed the natural world was the creation of God and showed the nature of the creator. According to Paley, God had carefully designed "even the most humble and insignificant organisms" and all of their minute features (such as the [[wing]]s and [[antenna (biology)|antennae]] of [[earwig]]s). He believed, therefore, that God must care even more for humanity.

Paley recognised that there is great suffering in nature and nature appears to be indifferent to pain. His way of reconciling that with his belief in a [[omnibenevolence|benevolent]] God was to assume that life had more pleasure than pain.''

As a side note, a charge of wholesale [[plagiarism]] from this book was brought against Paley in [[Athenaeum (British magazine)|''The Athenaeum'']] for 1848, but the famous illustration of the watch was not peculiar to Nieuwentyt and had been used by many others before either Paley or Nieuwentyt.

===Joseph Butler===
William Paley taught the works of [[Joseph Butler]] and appears to have built on Butler's 1736 design arguments of inferring a designer from evidence of design. Butler noted: 
"As the manifold Appearances of Design and of final Causes, in the Constitution of the World, prove it to be the Work of an intelligent Mind&amp;nbsp;... The appearances of ''Design'' and of ''final Causes'' in the constitution of nature as really prove this acting agent to be an ''intelligent Designer''...&amp;nbsp;ten thousand Instances of Design, cannot but prove a Designer.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4HFKAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA158&amp;dq=joseph+butler+1740+intelligent+designer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jn1gUZvlJbfJ4AOc9YDgBQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=design&amp;f=false | author = Joseph Butler | title = The Analogy of Religion, Natural and Revealed, to the Constitution and Course of Nature, 3rd Ed. London, MDCCXL (1740) pp 65, 158, 424 | publisher = John and Paul Knapton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jean-Jacques Rousseau===
Rousseau also mentioned the watchmaker theory. He wrote the following in his 1762 book, [[Emile (Rousseau)|Emile]]: &lt;blockquote&gt; I am like a man who sees the works of a watch for the first time; he is never weary of admiring the mechanism, though he does not know the use of the instrument and has never seen its face. I do not know what this is for, says he, but I see that each part of it is fitted to the rest, I admire the workman in the details of his work, and I am quite certain that all these wheels only work together in this fashion for some common end which I cannot perceive. Let us compare the special ends, the means, the ordered relations of every kind, then let us listen to the inner voice of feeling; what healthy mind can reject its evidence? Unless the eyes are blinded by prejudices, can they fail to see that the visible order of the universe proclaims a supreme intelligence? What sophisms must be brought together before we fail to understand the harmony of existence and the wonderful co-operation of every part for the maintenance of the rest? &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5427 ''Emile'', by Jean-Jacques Rousseau 1762]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==
===David Hume===
[[David Hume]] (1711-1776) offered a number of the most memorable philosophical criticisms to Paley's watch analogy before Darwin's theory of evolution had been developed. His criticisms can be separated into three major distinctions:

His first objection is that we have no experience of world-making. Hume highlighted the fact that everything we claim to know the cause of, we have derived the inductions from previous experiences of similar objects being created or seen the object itself being created ourselves. For example, with a watch, we know it has to be created by a watch-maker because we can observe it being made and compare it to the making of other similar watches or objects to deduce they have alike causes in their creation. However, he argues that we have no experience of the universe's creation or any other universe's creations to compare our own universe to and never will; therefore, it would be illogical to infer that our universe has been created by an intelligent designer in the same way  that a watch has.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The second criticism that Hume offers is about the form of the argument as an analogy in itself. An analogical argument claims that because object X (a watch) is like object Y (the universe) in one respect, both are therefore probably alike in another, hidden, respect (their cause, having to be created by an intelligent designer). He points out that for an argument from analogy to be successful, the two things that are being compared have to have an adequate number of similarities that are relevant to the respect that are analogised. For example, a kitten and a lion may be very similar in many respects, but just because a lion makes a "roar", it would not be correct to infer a kitten also "roars": the similarities between the two objects being not similar enough and the degree of relevance to what sound they make being not relevant enough. Hume then argues that the universe and a watch also do not have enough relevant or close similarities to infer that they were both created the same way. For example, the universe is made of organic natural material, but the watch is made of artificial mechanic materials. He claims that in the same respect, the universe could be argued to be more analogous to something more organic such as a vegetable (in which we can observe for ourselves does not need a 'designer' or a 'watchmaker' to be created). Although he admits the analogy of a universe to a vegetable to seem ridiculous, he says that it is just as ridiculous to analogize the universe with a watch.&lt;ref name=HumepartII&gt;{{cite book | title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion | author=Hume, David | authorlink=David Hume | publisher=Social Sciences Publishers | edition=with introduction by Norman Kemp Smith | year=1948 | chapter=Part II}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third criticism that Hume offers is that even if the argument did give evidence for a designer; it still gives no evidence for the traditional 'omnipotent', 'benevolent' (all-powerful and all-loving) God of traditional Christian theism. One of the main assumptions of Paley's argument is that 'like effects have like causes'; or that machines (like the watch) and the universe have similar features of design and so both also have the same cause of their existence: they must both have an intelligent designer. However, Hume points out that what Paley does not comprehend is to what extent 'like causes' extend: how similar the creation of a universe is to the creation of a watch. Instead, Paley moves straight to the conclusion that this designer of the universe is the 'God' he believes in of traditional Christianity. Hume, however takes the idea of 'like causes' and points out some potential absurdities in how far the 'likeness' of these causes could extend to if the argument were taken further as to explain this. One example that he uses is how a machine or a watch is usually designed by a whole team of people rather than just one person. Surely, if we are analogizing the two in this way, it would point to there being a group of gods who created the universe, not just a single being. Another example he uses is that complex machines are usually the result of many years of trial and error with every new machine being an improved version of the last. Also by analogy of the two, would that not hint that the universe could also have been just one of many of God's 'trials' and that there are much better universes out there? However, if that were taken to be true, surely the 'creator' of it all would not be 'all loving' and 'all powerful' if they had to carry out the process of 'trial and error' when creating the universe?&lt;ref name=HumepartV&gt;{{cite book | title=Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion | author=Hume, David | authorlink=David Hume | publisher=Social Sciences Publishers | edition=with introduction by Norman Kemp Smith | year=1948 | chapter=Part V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume also points out there is still a possibility that the universe could have been created by random chance but still show evidence of design as the universe is eternal and would have an infinite amount of time to be able to form a universe so complex and ordered as our own. He called that the 'Epicurean hypothesis'. It argued that when the universe was first created, the universe was random and chaotic, but if the universe is eternal, over an unlimited period of time, natural forces could have naturally 'evolved' by random particles coming together over time into the incredibly ordered system we can observe today without the need of an intelligent designer as an explanation.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

The last objection that he makes draws on the widely discussed [[problem of evil]]. He argues that all the daily unnecessary suffering that goes on everywhere within the world is yet another factor that pulls away from the idea that God is an 'omnipotent' 'benevolent' being.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Charles Darwin===
[[Image:Charles Darwin 1880.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Darwin]] in 1880]]

[[Charles Darwin]]'s theory provided another explanation.

When Darwin [[Charles Darwin's education|completed his studies]] of [[theology]] at [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] in 1831, he read Paley's ''Natural Theology'' and believed that the work gave rational proof of the [[existence of God]]. That was because living beings showed complexity and were exquisitely fitted to their places in a happy world.

Subsequently, on [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|the voyage of the ''Beagle'']], Darwin found that nature was not so beneficent, and the distribution of [[species]] did not support ideas of divine creation.  In 1838, shortly after his return, Darwin [[inception of Darwin's theory|conceived his theory]] that [[natural selection]], rather than divine design, was the best explanation for gradual change in populations over many generations. He  published the theory in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' in 1859, and in later editions, he noted responses that he had received:

{{Quote|It can hardly be supposed that a false theory would explain, in so satisfactory a manner as does the theory of natural selection, the several large classes of facts above specified. It has recently been objected that this is an unsafe method of arguing; but it is a method used in judging of the common events of life, and has often been used by the greatest natural philosophers&amp;nbsp;...

I see no good reason why the views given in this volume should shock the religious feelings of any one. It is satisfactory, as showing how transient such impressions are, to remember that the greatest discovery ever made by man, namely, the law of the attraction of gravity, was also attacked by Leibnitz, "as subversive of natural, and inferentially of revealed, religion." A celebrated author and divine has written to me that "he has gradually learnt to see that it is just as noble a conception of the Deity to believe that He created a few original forms capable of self-development into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of His laws."|Charles Darwin|The Origin of Species (1859)}}

Darwin reviewed the implications of this finding in his autobiography:
{{Quote|Although I did not think much about the existence of a personal God until a considerably later period of my life, I will here give the vague conclusions to which I have been driven. The old argument of design in nature, as given by Paley, which formerly seemed to me so conclusive, fails, now that the law of natural selection has been discovered. We can no longer argue that, for instance, the beautiful hinge of a bivalve shell must have been made by an intelligent being, like the hinge of a door by man. There seems to be no more design in the variability of organic beings and in the action of natural selection, than in the course which the wind blows. Everything in nature is the result of fixed laws.|Charles Darwin|The Autobiography of Charles Darwin 1809–1882. With the original omissions restored.}}

The idea that nature was governed by laws was already common, and in 1833, [[William Whewell]] as a proponent of the [[natural theology]] that Paley had inspired had written that "with regard to the material world, we can at least go so far as this—we can perceive that events are brought about not by insulated interpositions of Divine power, exerted in each particular case, but by the establishment of general laws."&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. R. 1859. ''On the Origin of Species''. London: John Murray, p. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=7 ii].&lt;br&gt; Whewell, William, 1833. ''Astronomy and general physics considered with reference to natural theology''. W. Pickering, London, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HB4HAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA356&amp;vq=But+with+regard+to+the+material+world,&amp;dq=%22Astronomy+and+General+Physics+Considered+with+Reference+to+Natural+Theology&amp;source=gbs_search_s 356]&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin, who spoke of the "fixed laws" concurred with Whewell, writing in his second edition of ''On The Origin of Species'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nagasawa|first=Yujin|title=The Existence of God: A Philosophical Introduction|year=2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=1-136-73746-4|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed by the Creator into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.|Charles Darwin|The Origin of Species (1860)}}

By the time that Darwin published his theory, theologians of [[liberal Christianity]] were already supporting such ideas, and by the late 19th century, their modernist approach was predominant in theology. In science, [[evolution]] theory incorporating Darwin's natural selection became completely accepted.

[[File:Dawkins at UT Austin.jpg|thumb|upright|Richard Dawkins]]

===Richard Dawkins===
In ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] argues that the watch analogy conflates the complexity that arises from living organisms that are able to reproduce themselves (and may cause to become more complex over time) with the complexity of inanimate objects, unable to pass on any reproductive changes (such as the multitude of parts manufactured in a watch). The comparison breaks down because of this important distinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Dawkins|title=The Blind Watchmaker: Why the Evidence of Evolution Reveals a Universe Without Design|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPpaZnZMDG0C|accessdate=15 September 2012|year=1986|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn=978-0-393-31570-7|pages=43–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|BBC Horizon]]'' episode, also entitled ''The Blind Watchmaker'', Dawkins described Paley's argument as being "as mistaken as it is elegant". In both contexts, he saw Paley as having made an incorrect proposal as to a certain problem's solution, but Dawkins did not disrespect him. In his essay ''The Big Bang'', [[Steven Pinker]] discusses Dawkins's coverage of Paley's argument, adding: "Biologists today do not disagree with Paley's laying out of the problem. They disagree only with his solution."

In his book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', Dawkins argues that life was the result of complex biological processes. He makes the argument that the comparison to the lucky construction of a watch is fallacious because proponents of evolution do not consider evolution "lucky". Rather than luck, the evolution of human life is the result of billions of years of natural selection. He concludes that evolution is a fair contestant to replace God in the role of watchmaker.

In addition, he argues that the watchmaker's creation of the watch implies that the watchmaker must be more complex than the watch.
Design is top-down, someone or something more complex designs something less complex.
To follow the line upwards demands that the watch was designed by a (necessarily more complex) watchmaker, the watchmaker must have been created by a more complex being than himself. So the question becomes who designed the designer? 
Dawkins argues that (a) this line continues ad infinitum, and (b) it does not explain anything.

Evolution, on the other hand, takes a bottom-up approach; it explains how more complexity can arise gradually by building on or combining lesser complexity.

In response to such claims, [[Nathan Schneider]] writes, "Paley died decades before ''The Origin of Species'' was published, and ever since his views have been so repeatedly set in opposition to Darwin's that Richard Dawkins titled one of his books on evolution ''The Blind Watchmaker''. A closer look at Paley's own thinking reveals, however, a God who works through the laws of nature, not beyond them like the modern ID theorists' designer. Paley had no objection to species changing over time. It's only in today's highly polarized culture-war climate that we don't bother to notice that one of the forefathers of intelligent design theory might have been perfectly comfortable with evolution."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/nathan-schneider/10-proofs-that-will-change-how-you-think-about-god_b_3392636.html 10 Proofs That Will Change How You Think About God by Nathan Schneider. The Huffington Post. June 6, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Faulty analogy===
Critics have found fault in the watch, or the alternative 'eye', analogy. Biologist [[Peter Richerson]] and anthropologist [[Robert Boyd (anthropologist)|Robert Boyd]] argue that a human could not make a watch alone and so a watch does not have a designer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Richerson &amp; Boyd|2005|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern day==
In the early 20th century, the modernist theology of [[higher criticism]] was contested in the United States by [[biblical literalism|Biblical literalists]], who campaigned successfully against the teaching of evolution and began calling themselves [[creationism|creationists]] in the 1920s. When teaching of evolution was reintroduced into [[public school (government funded)|public schools]] in the 1960s, they adopted what they called ''[[creation science]]'' that had a central concept of design in similar terms to Paley's argument. That idea was then relabeled ''[[intelligent design]]'', which presents the same analogy as an argument against evolution by natural selection without explicitly stating that the "intelligent designer" was God. The argument from the complexity of biological organisms was now presented as the ''[[irreducible complexity]]'' argument,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Scott EC, Matzke NJ |title=Biological design in science classrooms |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=104  |issue= suppl. 1|pages=8669–76 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17494747 |pmc=1876445 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0701505104 |url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17494747 |ref=harv |bibcode=2007PNAS..104.8669S}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most notable proponent of which was [[Michael Behe]], and, leveraging off the verbiage of [[information theory]], the ''[[specified complexity]]'' argument, the most notable proponent of which was [[William Dembski]].

The watchmaker analogy was referenced in the 2005 [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] trial. Throughout the trial, Paley was mentioned several times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day1pm.html Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District Day 1 PM session]&lt;/ref&gt; The defense's expert witness [[John Haught]] noted that both [[Intelligent Design]] and the watchmaker analogy are "reformulations" of the same theological argument.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day5pm.html Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District Day 5 PM session]&lt;/ref&gt;
On day 21 of the trial, Mr. Harvey walked Dr. Minnich through a modernized version of Paley's argument, substituting a cell phone for the watch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/dover/day21am2.html Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District Day 21 AM session]&lt;/ref&gt;
In his ruling, the judge stated that the use of the argument from design by intelligent design proponents "is merely a restatement of the Reverend William Paley's argument applied at the cell level"&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 79 of 139|Ruling, Whether ID Is Science, page 79]] [[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]] 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and that the argument from design is [[Subjectivity|subjective]].&lt;ref&gt;"It is readily apparent to the Court that the only attribute of design that biological systems appear to share with human artifacts is their complex appearance, i.e., if it looks complex or designed, it must have been designed. (23:73 (Behe)). This inference to design based upon the appearance of a "purposeful arrangement of parts" is a completely subjective proposition, determined in the eye of each beholder and his/her viewpoint concerning the complexity of a system."  [[wikisource:Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District/4:Whether ID Is Science#Page 81 of 139|Ruling, Whether ID Is Science, page 81]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water splitting''' is the [[chemical reaction]] in which [[water]] is broken down into [[oxygen]] and [[hydrogen]]:
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Efficient and economical photochemical water splitting would be a technological breakthrough that could underpin a [[hydrogen economy]].  A version of water splitting occurs in [[photosynthesis]], but hydrogen is not produced. No practical version of water splitting has been demonstrated, but the two component reactions (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production) are well known.  The reverse of water splitting is the basis of the [[hydrogen fuel cell]].

== Electrolysis ==
{{Main article|Electrolysis of water}}
[[File:Electrolyser, front, B.jpg|thumb|Electrolyser front with electrical panel in foreground]]
[[Electrolysis of water]] is the decomposition of [[water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) into [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) due to an [[electricity|electric current]] being passed through the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Hauch, A.; Ebbesen, S. D.; Jensen, S. H.; Mogensen, M.|title=Highly Efficient high temperature electrolysis|journal=J. Mater. Chem.|year=2008|volume=18|pages=2331–2340|doi=10.1039/b718822f}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Vion, {{US patent|28793}}, "Improved method of using atmospheric electricity", June 1860.

In [[power to gas]] production schemes, the excess power or off peak power created by wind generators or solar arrays is used for load balancing of the energy grid by storing and later injecting the hydrogen into the natural gas grid.

Production of hydrogen from water is energy intensive. Potential electrical energy supplies include hydropower, wind turbines, or photovoltaic cells. Usually, the electricity consumed is more valuable than the hydrogen produced so this method has not been widely used. In contrast with low-temperature electrolysis, [[high-temperature electrolysis]] (HTE) of water converts more of the initial [[heat]] energy into chemical energy (hydrogen), potentially doubling [[fuel efficiency|efficiency]] to about 50%. Because some of the energy in HTE is supplied in the form of heat, less of the energy must be converted twice (from heat to electricity, and then to chemical form), and so the process is more efficient.

==Water splitting in photosynthesis ==
A version of water splitting occurs in [[photosynthesis]], but the electrons are shunted, not to protons, but to the electron transport chain in [[photosystem II]].  The electrons are used to convert carbon dioxide into sugars.

When photosystem I gets photo-excited, electron transfer reactions gets initiated, which results in reduction of a series of electron acceptors, eventually reducing NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to NADPH and PS I is oxidized. The oxidized photosystem I captures electrons from photosystem II through a series of steps involving agents like plastoquinone, cytochromes and plastocyanine. The photosystem II then brings about water oxidation resulting in evolution of oxygen, the reaction being catalyzed by CaMn&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; clusters embedded in complex protein environment; the complex is known as oxygen evolving complex (OEC).&lt;ref&gt;Yano, J.; Kern, J.; Sauer, K.; Latimer, M. J.; Pushkar, Y.; Biesiadka, J.; Loll, B.; Saenger, W.; Messinger, J.; Zouni, A.; Yachandra, V. K., Where Water Is Oxidized to Dioxygen: Structure of the Photosynthetic Mn(4)Ca Cluster.

[[File:Algae hydrogen production.jpg|frame|An [[algae bioreactor]] for hydrogen production.]]
In [[Biological hydrogen production (Algae)|biological hydrogen production]], the electrons produced by the photosystem are shunted not to a chemical synthesis apparatus but to [[hydrogenase]]s, resulting in formation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  This biohydrogen is produced in an [[bioreactor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/progress08/ii_f_2_melis.pdf DOE 2008 Report 25 %]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photoelectrochemical water splitting==
{{Main article|photoelectrochemical cell|artificial photosynthesis}}
Using electricity produced by [[photovoltaic]] systems potentially offers the cleanest way to produce hydrogen, other than nuclear, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric.  Again, water is broken down into hydrogen and oxygen by electrolysis, but the electrical energy is obtained by a [[photoelectrochemical cell]] (PEC) process.  The system is also named [[artificial photosynthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14441-electrode-lights-the-way-to-artificial-photosynthesis.html Electrode lights the way to artificial photosynthesis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/Energy/21155/?a=f Solar-Power Breakthrough: Researchers have found a cheap and easy way to store the energy made by solar power]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://swegene.com/pechouse-a-proposed-cell-solar-hydrogen.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= del Valle |first= F. |last2= Ishikawa |first2= A. |last3= Domen |first3= K. |date=May 2009|last4= Villoria De La Mano |first4= J.A.|last5= Sánchez-Sánchez|first5= M.C.|last6= González|first6= I.D.|last7= Herreras|first7= S.|last8= Mota|first8= N.|last9= Rivas|first9= M.E. |title= Influence of Zn concentration in the activity of Cd1-xZnxS solid solutions for water splitting under visible light |journal= Catalysis Today |volume= 143 |issue= 1–2 |pages= 51–59 |publisher= |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= 10.1016/j.cattod.2008.09.024 |bibcode= |ref=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photocatalytic water splitting==
{{Main article|Photocatalytic water splitting}}
The conversion of solar energy to hydrogen by means of water splitting process is one of the most interesting ways to achieve clean and renewable energy. However, if this process is assisted by photocatalysts suspended directly in water rather than a photovoltaic or an electrolytic system, the reaction takes place in one step, it therefore can be more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= del Valle |first= F. |date=Jun 2009|last2= Álvarez Galván |first2= M.

==Thermal decomposition of water==
{{Main article|Thermochemical cycle}}
In [[thermolysis]], water molecules split into their atomic components [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. For example, at 2200&amp;nbsp;°C about three percent of all H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are dissociated into various combinations of hydrogen and oxygen atoms, mostly H, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, O, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and OH. Other reaction products like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; remain minor. At the very high temperature of 3000&amp;nbsp;°C more than half of the water molecules are decomposed, but at ambient temperatures only one molecule in 100 trillion dissociates by the effect of heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Int J Hydrogen Energy |volume=26 |year=2001 |pages=185pp |title=Thermochemical hydrogen production: past and present |doi=10.1016/S0360-3199(00)00062-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The high temperatures and material constraints have limited the applications of this approach.

===Nuclear-thermal===
{{see also|NGNP}}
Some prototype [[Generation IV reactor]]s, such as the [[High-temperature engineering test reactor]], operate at 850 to 1000 [[degrees Celsius]], considerably hotter than existing commercial [[nuclear power]] plants. [[General Atomics]] predicts that hydrogen produced in a High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactor ([[HTGR]]) would cost $1.53/[[kilogram|kg]]. In 2003, steam reforming of natural gas yielded hydrogen at $1.40/kg. At {{As of|2005|alt=2005}} gas prices, hydrogen cost $2.70/kg.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}  Hence, just within the United States, a savings of tens of billions of dollars per year is possible with a nuclear-powered supply. Much of this savings would translate into reduced oil and natural gas imports.

One side benefit of a nuclear reactor that produces both [[electricity]] and hydrogen is that it can shift production between the two. For instance, the plant might produce electricity during the day and hydrogen at night, matching its electrical generation profile to the daily variation in demand. If the hydrogen can be produced economically, this scheme would compete favorably with existing [[grid energy storage]] schemes. What is more, there is sufficient hydrogen demand in the [[United States]] that all daily peak generation could be handled by such plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dis.anl.gov/ceeesa/documents/NuclearHydrogen_ANL0530Final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927075457/http://www.dis.anl.gov/ceeesa/documents/NuclearHydrogen_ANL0530Final.pdf |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hybrid thermoelectric [[Copper-chlorine cycle]] is a [[cogeneration]] system using the [[waste heat]] from nuclear reactors, specifically the [[CANDU reactor|CANDU]] [[supercritical water reactor]].&lt;ref name=Naterer&gt;{{cite journal |last=Naterer |first=G. F. |title=Recent Canadian Advances in Nuclear-Based Hydrogen Production and the Thermochemical Cu-Cl Cycle |journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy |volume=34 |issue=7 |pages=2901–2917 |year=2009 |doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2009.01.090 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar-thermal===

The high temperatures necessary to split water can be achieved through the use of [[concentrating solar power]].  [[Hydrosol-2]] is a 100-kilowatt pilot plant at the [[Plataforma Solar de Almería]] in [[Spain]] which uses sunlight to obtain the required 800 to 1,200&amp;nbsp;°C to split water. Hydrosol II has been in operation since 2008. The design of this 100-kilowatt pilot plant is based on a modular concept. As a result, it may be possible that this technology could be readily scaled up to megawatt range by multiplying the available reactor units and by connecting the plant to [[heliostat]] fields (fields of sun-tracking mirrors) of a suitable size.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dlr.de/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-1/86_read-14380/&lt;/ref&gt;

Material constraints due to the required high temperatures are reduced by the design of a membrane reactor with simultaneous extraction of hydrogen and oxygen that exploits a defined thermal gradient and the fast diffusion of hydrogen. With concentrated sunlight as heat source and only water in the reaction chamber, the produced gases are very clean with the only possible contaminant being water. A "Solar Water Cracker" with a concentrator of about 100 m² can produce almost one kilogram of hydrogen per sunshine hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://h2powersystems.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

Its comprehension has been made possible ever since the discovery of water electrolysis by means of the titanium dioxide. [[Artificial photosynthesis]] is a research field that attempts to replicate the natural process of photosynthesis, converting sunlight, water and carbon dioxide into carbohydrates and oxygen. Recently, this has been successful in splitting water into hydrogen and oxygen using an artificial compound called [[Nafion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-08/mu-mtl081408.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[High-temperature electrolysis]] (also HTE or [[steam electrolysis]]) is a method currently being investigated for the production of hydrogen from water with oxygen as a by-product. Other research includes [[thermolysis]] on defective [[carbon]] substrates, thus making hydrogen production possible at temperatures just under 1000&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The [[iron oxide cycle]] is a series of [[Thermochemistry|thermochemical]] processes used to [[Hydrogen production|produce hydrogen]]. The iron oxide cycle consists of two [[chemical reaction]]s whose net reactant is [[water]] and whose net products are [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. All other chemicals are recycled. The iron oxide process requires an efficient source of heat.

The [[sulfur-iodine cycle]] (S-I cycle) is a series of [[Thermochemistry|thermochemical]] processes used to [[Hydrogen production|produce hydrogen]]. The S-I cycle consists of three [[chemical reaction]]s whose net reactant is water and whose net products are [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]]. All other chemicals are recycled. The S-I process requires an efficient source of heat.

More than 352 [[thermochemistry|thermochemical]] cycles have been described for water splitting or [[thermolysis]].,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review06/pd_10_weimer.pdf 353 Thermochemical cycles]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://shgr.unlv.edu/stchNew/source/login.asp UNLV Thermochemical cycle automated scoring database (public)]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cycles promise to produce hydrogen  oxygen from water and heat without using electricity.&lt;ref name="Developmentof"&gt;[http://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/pdfs/review05/pd28_weimer.pdf Development of solar-powered thermochemical production of hydrogen from water]&lt;/ref&gt; Since all the input energy for such processes is heat, they can be more efficient than high-temperature electrolysis. This is because the efficiency of electricity production is inherently limited. Thermochemical production of hydrogen using chemical energy from coal or natural gas is generally not considered, because the direct chemical path is more efficient.

For all the thermochemical processes, the summary reaction is that of the decomposition of water:
:&lt;chem&gt; 2H2O &lt;=&gt;[\stackrel{}\ce{Heat}] {2H2} + O2&lt;/chem&gt;
All other reagents are recycled. None of the thermochemical hydrogen production processes have been demonstrated at production levels, although several have been demonstrated in laboratories.

There is also research into the viability of nanoparticles and catalysts to lower the temperature at which water splits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoptek.com/ Naoptek]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.treehugger.com/files/2008/07/hydrogen-production-breakthrough-from-mit-a-giant-leap.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently [[Metal-Organic Framework]] (MOF)-based materials have been shown to be a highly promising candidate for water splitting with cheap, first row transition metals.;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Das | display-authors = etal   | year = 2013 | title = | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201301327/abstract | journal = Angew.
