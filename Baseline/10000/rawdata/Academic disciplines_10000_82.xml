      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5490">'''Academic detailing''' is “[[university]] or [[non-commercial]]-based educational outreach.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Soumerai SB, Avorn J | year = 1990 | title = Principles of educational outreach ('academic detailing') to improve clinical decision making | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 263 | issue = 4| pages = 549–56 | doi=10.1001/jama.1990.03440040088034}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process involves face-to-face education of prescribers by trained [[health care]] professionals, typically [[pharmacists]], [[physicians]], or [[nurses]]. The goal of academic detailing is to improve prescribing of targeted [[drugs]] to be consistent with [[medical]] evidence from [[randomized controlled trials]], which ultimately improves patient care and can reduce [[health care costs]]. A key component of non-commercial or university-based academic detailing programs is that they (academic detailers/clinical educators, management, staff, program developers, etc.) do not have any financial links to the [[pharmaceutical industry]].

Academic detailing has been studied for over 25 years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Avorn J, Soumerai SB | year = 1983 | title = Improving drug-therapy decisions through educational outreach. A [[randomized controlled trial]] of academically based "detailing | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 308 | issue = 24| pages = 1457–63 | doi=10.1056/nejm198306163082406}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been shown to be effective at improving prescribing of targeted medications about 5% from baseline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=O'Brien MA, Rogers S, Jamtvedt G | year = 2007 | title = Educational outreach visits: effects on professional practice and health care outcomes | doi = 10.1002/14651858.cd000409.pub2 | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 4 | issue = | page = CD000409 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though it is primarily used to affect prescribing, it is also used to educate providers regarding other [[non-drug intervention]]s, such as [[screening guideline]]s.

== Organizations ==
Many academic detailing programs exist around the world. In the [[United States]], university-based state programs exist in [[Vermont]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.med.uvm.edu/ahec/TB1+BL.asp?SiteAreaID=290&lt;/ref&gt; Oregon&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20110720024858/http://pharmacy.oregonstate.edu/drug_policy/index.php?nav=ROAD&lt;/ref&gt; and [[South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sccp.sc.edu/SCORxE&lt;/ref&gt;  The nonprofit organization Alosa Health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://alosahealth.org/|title=Alosa Health|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; runs an academic detailing program in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Washington, DC called the Independent Drug Information Service (IDIS). The National Resource Center for Academic Detailing (NaRCAD), funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) in 2010, was created to help organizations with limited resources to establish and improve their own programs and to create a network of academic detailing programs. The [[U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs]] Pharmacy Benefits Management pilot tested the National Academic Detailing Service in 2010 to enhance veterans' outcomes by empowering clinicians and promoting the use of evidence-based treatments using delivered by clinical pharmacy specialists.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.pbm.va.gov/PBM/academicdetailingservice/AboutUs.asp (Last accessed: 20 October 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; After the pilot, in March 2015, the Interim Under Secretary for Health issued a memorandum requiring implementation of AD programs throughout the [[Veterans Health Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.veterans.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/VA%20Clancy%20Testimony%203.26.20151.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs also exist in [[Canada]] through the [[Canadian Academic Detailing Collaboration (CADC)]],&lt;ref&gt;http://ebm.oscarmcmaster.org/ebm-resources/CADC%20Handout%202008.doc&lt;/ref&gt; including the [https://effectivepractice.org Centre for Effective Practice]'s (CEP) [https://effectivepractice.org/resources/academic-detailing-service/ academic detailing service] in Ontario,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jin|first=Margaret|last2=Naumann|first2=Terryn|last3=Regier|first3=Loren|last4=Bugden|first4=Shawn|last5=Allen|first5=Michael|last6=Salach|first6=Lena|last7=Chelak|first7=Kristen|last8=Blythe|first8=Nancy|last9=Gagnon|first9=Antony|date=May 2012|title=A brief overview of academic detailing in Canada: Another role for pharmacists|journal=Canadian Pharmacists Journal : CPJ|volume=145|issue=3|pages=142–146.e2|doi=10.3821/145.3.cpj142|issn=1715-1635|pmc=3567505|pmid=23509530}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Australia]] through the [[Drug and Therapeutics Information Service]] (DATIS) and the [[National Prescribing Service]] (NPS). In Belgium academic detailing is provided by Project Farmaka.

The '''Astronomical Society of the Pacific''' ('''ASP''') is an American scientific and educational organization, founded in [[San Francisco]] on February 7, 1889. Its name derives from its origins on the Pacific Coast, but today it has members all over the country and the world. It has the legal status of a nonprofit organization.

It is the largest general [[astronomy]] education society in the world{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}, with members from over 40 countries.

The ASP's goal is to promote public interest in and awareness of astronomy (and increase [[scientific literacy]]) through its publications, web site, and many educational and outreach programs.  These include:

* Project ASTRO - a national program that improves the teaching of astronomy and physical science (using hands-on inquiry-based activities) by pairing amateur and professional astronomers with 4th through 9th grade teachers and classes.
* Family ASTRO - a project that develops kits and games to help families enjoy astronomy in their leisure time and trains astronomers, educators, and community leaders
* Astronomy from the Ground Up - a national program to help educators at smaller science museums, nature centers and environmental education organizations create or enhance astronomy education programs.
* The Night Sky Network - a program with the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] that supports a community of over 450 amateur astronomy clubs around the U.S. in public outreach activities, providing them with kits and training. The clubs have sky gazing events, solar viewings, and give presentations for the public.
* Classroom materials and resources in astronomy (many developed by the Society's educational staff) sold through their online AstroShop or made available free through their web site

The ASP assists with astronomy education and outreach by partnering with other organizations both in the United States and internationally, and organizes an annual meeting to promote the appreciation and understanding of astronomy.

Presidents of the ASP have included such notable astronomers as [[Edwin Hubble]], [[George O. Abell]], and [[Frank Drake]]. [[George Pardee]], who later became Governor of the State of California, served as president in 1899.

==Publications==
The society promotes astronomy education through several publications. ''[[The Universe in the Classroom]]'', a free electronic educational newsletter for teachers and other educators around the world who help students of all ages learn more about the wonders of the universe through astronomy.

''[[Mercury (magazine)|Mercury]]'', the ASP's quarterly on-line membership magazine, covers a wide range of astronomy topics, from history and [[archaeoastronomy]] to cutting-edge developments. First published in 1925 as the ''Leaflets of the ASP'', ''Mercury'' is now disseminated to thousands of ASP members and schools, universities, libraries, observatories, and institutions around the world.

The ASP also publishes the journal ''[[Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] (PASP)'' aimed at professional astronomers. The ''PASP'' is a technical journal of refereed papers on astronomical research covering all wavelengths and distance scales as well as papers on the latest innovations in astronomical instrumentation and software, and has been publishing journals since 1889.

The '''''Astronomical Society of the Pacific Conference Series''''' (ASPCS) is a series of over 400 volumes of professional astronomy conference proceedings. Started in 1988, the Conference Series has grown to become a prominent publication series in the world of professional astronomy publications, and now publishes an average of 20-25 volumes per year. Volumes are sold to the attendees of the conferences of which the proceedings are published, as well as being offered through the Astronomical Society of the Pacific's AstroShop, and can be found in the libraries of major universities and research institutions worldwide. In 2004, the ASPCS stepped into electronic publishing, offering electronic access subscriptions for libraries and institutions, as well as individual access to volumes which they have purchased in hard copy form.

''Astronomy Beat'' is an on-line column, which comes out every other week, and features a behind-the-scenes report on some aspect of astronomical discovery, astronomy education, or astronomy as a hobby, written by a key participant.  Authors have included:
* [[Clyde Tombaugh]], retelling the story of his discovery of the (dwarf) planet [[Pluto]]
* [[Michael E. Brown]], discussing the naming of the [[dwarf planet]] [[Makemake (dwarf planet)|Makemake]]
* Noted [[astronomical photographer]] [[David Malin]] describing the transition from [[photographic processing|chemical]] to [[digital photography]]
* [[Virginia Louise Trimble]] explaining how she selected her list of the top ten astronomical discoveries of the last thousand years.

==Awards==
The ASP makes several different awards annually:
*The [[Bruce Medal]] for lifetime contribution to astronomy research.  The medal is named after [[Catherine Wolfe Bruce]].  This award is arguably the most prestigious award given in astronomy.
*The [[Klumpke-Roberts Award]] for outstanding contributions to the public understanding and appreciation of astronomy, named for [[Dorothea Klumpke-Roberts]].
*The [[Amateur Achievement Award of Astronomical Society of the Pacific|Amateur Achievement Award]] in recognition of significant contributions to astronomy by one not employed in the field of astronomy in a professional capacity.
*The [[Bart Bok Award]], named in honor of [[astronomer]] [[Bart Bok]], awarded jointly with the [[American Astronomical Society]] to outstanding student projects in astronomy at the [[International Science and Engineering Fair]].
*The [[Thomas Brennan Award]] for exceptional achievement related to the teaching of astronomy at the high school level.
*The [[Maria and Eric Muhlmann Award]] for recent significant observational results made possible by innovative advances in astronomical instrumentation, software, or observational infrastructure.
*The [[Robert J. Trumpler Award]], named in honor of [[astronomer]] [[Robert J. Trumpler]], given to a recent recipient of a Ph.D degree with a particularly notable thesis.
* The [[Richard H. Emmons|Richard Emmons Award]] is given for a lifetime of contributions to the teaching of astronomy to college non-science majors.
* The Las Cumbres Amateur Outreach Award, established by Wayne Rosing and Dorothy Largay, seeks to honor outstanding educational outreach by an amateur astronomer to K-12 children and the interested lay public.
* The [[Arthur B. C. Walker Jr.|Arthur B.C. Walker II]] Award, first announced in 2016, for research and teaching with a substantial commitment to students from underrepresented groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.astrosociety.org/about-us/awards/ |title=Annual Awards |publisher=Astronomical Society |website=www.astrosociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defunct awards==
*The Donohoe Comet Medal (1890–1950). In July 1889 the ASP announced that a bronze medal for "the actual discovery of any unexpected comet" would be awarded on the basis of a $500 gift by Joseph A. Donohoe of San Francisco. The first award was made in March 1890 to [[William Robert Brooks|W. R. Brooks]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific |title=Awards of the Comet-Medal of the ASP (1890-1896) |volume=9 |pages= 99 |date=1897 |location=San Francisco |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xa7nAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA99 |jstor = 40671005}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the discovery of the comet now known as [[16P/Brooks]]. After the 250th medal had been awarded in 1950 the award was discontinued because photography had enabled the discovery of too many comets.&lt;ref name="ASP history"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astrosociety.org/about-us/history-of-the-asp/ |title=History |publisher=Astronomical Society |website=www.astrosociety.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Comet Medal (1969–1974). In 1968 the ASP Board voted to create a new Comet Medal to be awarded once yearly to recognize "an outstanding nonprofessional astronomer" for "past contributions to the study of comets." The first award was made in 1969 to [[Reginald Lawson Waterfield|Reginald L. Waterfield]]. After 1974 the Comet Medal was discontinued.&lt;ref name="ASP history"/&gt;

=== Beakerhead Big Bang Program ===
Beakerhead Big Bang is an interactive public art proposal and residency program that helps support the creation of new artwork, which will debut in Calgary during the five-day long Beakerhead event every September. The program invites artists, architects, scientists, and other creative professionals to propose an interactive public art installation that incorporates science, technology, and collective experience. The selected project will be funded by Beakerhead and built in Calgary over the course of a year, beginning with a weeklong planning residency hosted at [[Banff Centre|Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity]].

The inaugural Big Bang Residency was awarded to the BASS SHIP by Beama.The BASS Ship, which stands for Beama Applied Sciences Sector Ship, is a 30-foot high interactive audio-visual spaceship that invites participants to explore ideas about non-verbal communication, culture, and civilization.

=== School Programs ===
Beakerhead works with the kindergarten to grade 12 education system to provide curriculum-related experiences that allow students to explore the combination of both artistic and scientific skills. In 2015, Beakerhead worked with 24,200 students in 104 participating schools. The current school programs include field trips, school visits, and an annual Ingenuity Challenge.

=== SciComm Lab ===
For the past ten years, the co-founders of Beakerhead, [[Jay Ingram]] and [http://www.cdnsciencepub.com/blog/women-in-science-mary-anne-moser-ceo-and-cofounder-of-beakerhead.aspx Mary Anne Moser], have hosted a science and communications program at the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity where participants could learn to present science with a compelling, audience-focused approach. Previously, the SciComm labs have been intensive two-week summer courses, but, as of 2017, Beakerhead is extending the program and offering courses across Canada. Previous course sessions included "Elevator Pitch," "Personalizing the Impersonal," "Audience-Focused Communications," and "Improv."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15343">Starting in the early 1990s, [[James F. Moore]] originated the [[strategic planning]] concept of a '''business ecosystem''', now widely adopted in the [[high tech]] community. The basic definition comes from Moore's book, ''[[The Death of Competition: Leadership and Strategy in the Age of Business Ecosystems]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The origins of the concept==
The concept first appeared in Moore's May/June 1993 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article, titled "Predators and Prey: A New Ecology of Competition", and won the [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] Award for article of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:9vCCtUPpvH8J:www.isc.hbs.edu/mckinsey.pdf+james+moore+1993+mckinsey+award&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESi5p3-FjaIXFtwHhFgLk7zc8HukKsFKCUhk17KyhXsWjl2ZBPZOiATTd8LJWia5pJCZRj4xKsTs09f6p0XeZxJZaE3IJFQ5fhcsM9aZEgs6ahQVkQQm_JuL7rsOA_h49yV403Cf&amp;sig=AHIEtbQsPjXx1J8LDyvOVZQBtu41LnVm1w|page=2|title=McKinsey Award Winners for Best ''HBR'' Articles|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore defined "business ecosystem" as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
An economic community supported by a foundation of interacting organizations and individuals—the organisms of the business world. The economic community produces goods and services of value to customers, who are themselves members of the ecosystem. The member organisms also include suppliers, lead producers, competitors, and other stakeholders. Over time, they [[coevolve]] their capabilities and roles, and tend to align themselves with the directions set by one or more central companies. Those companies holding leadership roles may change over time, but the function of ecosystem leader is valued by the community because it enables members to move toward shared visions to align their investments, and to find mutually supportive roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Moore|1996|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moore used several ecological [[metaphor]]s, suggesting that the firm is embedded in a (business) environment, that it needs to coevolve with other companies, and that “the particular [[Ecological niche|niche]] a business occupies is challenged by newly arriving species.”&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Moore|1996|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that companies need to become proactive in developing mutually beneficial ("[[symbiotic]]") relationships with customers, suppliers, and even competitors.

Using ecological metaphors to describe business structure and operations is increasingly common especially within the field of information technology (IT). For example, [[J. Bradford DeLong]], a professor of economics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], has written that "business ecosystems" describe “the pattern of launching new technologies that has emerged from [[Silicon Valley]]”.&lt;ref name=delong1&gt;{{
harvnb|DeLong|2000|loc=para. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Cohen|DeLong|Zysman|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines business ecology as “a more productive set of processes for developing and commercializing new technologies” that is characterized by the “rapid prototyping, short product-development cycles, early test marketing, options-based compensation, venture funding, early corporate independence”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|DeLong|2000|loc=para. 6 &amp; 4, respectively}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeLong also has expressed that the new way is likely to endure “because it's a better business ecology than the legendarily lugubrious model refined at [[Xerox PARC|Xerox Parc]]—a more productive set of processes for rapidly developing and commercializing new technologies”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|DeLong|2000|loc=para. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mangrove Software,&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Mangrove|2001|loc=para. 1}}: “(t)he interaction and correlation of economic conditions, technology, customers, employees, corporate partners, shareholders, and competitors forming the environment under which a business operates”.&lt;/ref&gt; The Montague Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Montague|1993|loc=para. 1}}: “interacting systems consisting of companies, their customers and suppliers, and other players in the business environment”&lt;/ref&gt; Kenneth L. Kraemer, director of the [[University of California, Irvine]]’s Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Kraemer|1999|loc=para. 11}}: “It is the applications that firms buy or create themselves that bring value-added to the firm and to its business ecology of customers, suppliers and business partners”.&lt;/ref&gt; and Stephen Abram, Vice President of Micromedia, Ltd.,&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Abram|2000|loc=para. 4}}: has asserted that the Web is “maturing as a business ecology”&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Gruber, co-founder and CTO of Intraspect Software,&lt;ref name=gruber&gt;{{
harvnb|Gruber|loc=para. 4}}: “Imagine that companies are like organisms in an evolutionary landscape”&lt;/ref&gt; Vinod K. Dar, Managing Director of Dar &amp; Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Dar|1999|loc=para. 1}}: “Evolution on the Internet is no different from physical evolution but with vastly compressed life cycles and faster genetic mutation”.&lt;/ref&gt; have all advocated this approach.

==Industries==
Gruber explains that over a century ago, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motors]] did well using methods of mass production, an assembly line, and [[insourcing]]. However, Ford began to outsource its production “[w]hen the ecology evolved.” Gruber (n.d.) has stated that such evolution in the ecology of the business world is “punctuated now and then by radical changes in the environment” and that “globalization and the Internet are the equivalents of large-scale climate change. Globalization is eliminating the traditional advantages of the large corporation: access to capital, access to markets, and economies of scale”.&lt;ref name=gruber/&gt;

The [[application service provider]] (ASP) industry is moving toward relationship networks and focusing on core competencies. “According to the gospel of [[Cisco Systems]], companies inclined to exist together within an “ecosystem” facilitate the imminence of Internet-based application delivery”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Kaminsky|2000|loc=para. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Books also use natural systems metaphors without discussing the interfaces between human business and biological ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Baskin|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another work defines business ecology as “a new field for sustainable organizational management and design,” one “that is based on the principle that organizations, as living organisms, are most successful when their development and behavior are aligned with their core purpose and values – what we call “social DNA’”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Abe|Dempsey|Bassett|1998|pp=xii-xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for companies to attend to ecological health is indicated by the following: “Business ecology is based on the elegant structure and principles of natural systems. It recognizes that to develop healthy business ecosystems, leaders and their organizations must see themselves, and their environments, through an “ecological lens”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Abe|Dempsey|Bassett|1998|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological ecosystems==
Some environmentalists have used "business ecosystems" as a way to talk about environmental issues as they relate to business rather than as a metaphor to describe the increasing complexity of relationships among companies. According to Townsend, business ecology is the study of the reciprocal relationship between business and organisms and their environments. The goal of this "business ecology" is sustainability through the complete ecological synchronization and integration of a business with the sites that it inhabits, uses, and affects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Townsend|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other environmentalists believe that the ecosystem metaphor is just a way for business to appear 'Green'. According to author [[Alan Marshall (New Zealand author)|Alan Marshall]], the metaphor is used to make out that somehow business operates using natural principles which should be left to run without interference by governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Unity of Nature: Wholeness and Disintegration in Ecology and Science|last = Marshall|first = Alan|publisher = Imperial College Press|year = 2002|isbn = 9781860943300|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Pages needed|date=February 2016}}

{{Anthropology}}

'''Cognitive anthropology''' is an approach within [[cultural anthropology]] in which scholars seek to explain patterns of shared knowledge, [[cultural]] [[innovation]], and transmission over time and space using the methods and [[theories]] of the [[cognitive sciences]] (especially [[experimental psychology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]) often through close collaboration with historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of cultural forms. Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge, in the sense of what they think subconsciously, changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|D'Andrade|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Cognitive anthropology has strong ties to [[ethnoscience]] and [[linguistics]].

==Scope==
Cognitive anthropology studies a range of domains including folk taxonomies, the interaction of language and thought, and cultural models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|D'Andrade|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From a linguistics stand-point, cognitive anthropology uses language as the doorway to study cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Quinn|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its general goal is to break language down to find commonalities in different cultures and the ways people perceive the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Colby|Fernandez|Kronenfeld|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Linguistic study of cognitive anthropology may be broken down into three subfields: [[semantics]], [[syntactics]], and [[pragmatics]].

==Methods==
In contrast to traditional ethnographic methods in cultural anthropology, cognitive anthropology primarily uses quantitative methodologies in order to study culture. Because of the field's interest in determining shared knowledge, [[consensus analysis]] has been used as its most widely used statistical measure.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvcoltxt|D'Andrade|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the techniques used is [[Cultural Network Analysis]], the drawing of networks of interrelated ideas that are widely shared among members of a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sieck|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently there has been some interchange between cognitive anthropologists and those working in artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gomm|2009|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation with cognitive science==
Anthropology is one of six fields which contributed to the founding of [[cognitive science]]. However, anthropology has been criticised for being detached from cognitive science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bender|first1=Andrea|last2=Hutchins|first2=Edwin|last3=Medin|first3=Douglas|title=Anthropology in Cognitive Science|journal=Topics in Cognitive Science|date=8 March 2010|volume=2|issue=3|pages=374–385|doi=10.1111/j.1756-8765.2010.01082.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2010.01082.x/abstract|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Communication University of China''' ('''CUC''') ({{zh|s=中国传媒大学|p=Zhōngguó Chuánméi Dàxué}}) is a public university in [[Beijing]]. Formerly known as the '''Beijing Broadcasting Institute''' ('''BBI''') ({{zh|s=北京广播学院|p=Běijīng Guǎngbō Xuéyuàn}}), it is one of the [[Project 211]] key universities directly administered by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China]]. The predecessor of the school was a training center for technicians of the Central Broadcasting Bureau that was founded in 1954. In April 1959, the school was upgraded to the Beijing Broadcasting Institute approved by the State Council. In August 2004, the BBI was renamed into the Communication University of China.
==Rank==

==History==
[[Image:Communication University of China.jpg|thumb|left|The Soviet Style Teaching Building of the Newly Established School of Foreign Languages]]
CUC's history dates back to March 3, 1954 when the first training class for broadcasting professionals was held by the then Central Radio Administration. This then led to the founding of Beijing Broadcasting College in 1958. On September 7, 1959, CUC's precursor Beijing Broadcasting Institute (BBI) was established. During the ensuing four decades, BBI remained a relatively small college and only known among the circles of Chinese media professionals.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

On August 19, 2004, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]] approved the renaming of the institute to the '''Communication University of China'''. It has now developed into a comprehensive institute of higher learning with broadcasting, film production, journalism, drama, animation, advertising, newscasting, creative cultural industry, Communications engineering, foreign languages (especially minority language),  management and media law education as its major academic disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
CUC's 116.88 hectare main campus is located in Dingfuzhuang, eastern part of [[Chaoyang District, Beijing|Chaoyang District]], [[Beijing]]. It is just outside the Eastern [[5th Ring Road]], and is just along the Beijing-Tong County expressway. With increasing number of students and fast development, the university has expanded its campus to nearby areas to provide more space for student and staff accommodation and research institutions. The main campus is composed of teaching and administrative buildings, theatres for cultural activities, large compounds of student dormitories and staff apartments, media production studios and scientific research centers. The campus is linked by the [[Communication University of China Station]] of Beijing subway [[Batong Line, Beijing Subway|Batong Line]].

===Student societies===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
CUC has over 50 Student Societies, including Amigos Latin Dance Society, Association of Green Hope, Association of Luxun Studies, Budai Drama Society, Drama Society Experimental Drama Society, Guitar Club, Minority Languages Society, TYP Animation Society and so on.

===Chinese language teaching for foreigners===

The Chinese language school for foreigners is inexpensive but gets relatively poor reviews from students due to relatively disorganization and inexperienced faculty, according to a Global Times report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://beijing.globaltimes.cn/life/edu-tech/2011-06/661375.html |title=How do Beijing's best universities compare for students? |date=June 2, 2011 |accessdate=8 November 2011 |publisher=Global Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902135514/http://beijing.globaltimes.cn/life/edu-tech/2011-06/661375.html |archivedate=2 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://beijing.globaltimes.cn/life/edu-tech/2011-06/661373.html |title=Breaking down the best universities for studying Chinese |date=June 2, 2011 |accessdate=8 November 2011 |publisher=Global Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902142230/http://beijing.globaltimes.cn/life/edu-tech/2011-06/661373.html |archivedate=2 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of art sidebar}}
'''Contemporary art''' is the [[art]] of today, produced in the second half of the 20th century or in the 21st century. Contemporary artists work in a [[globally influenced]], [[culturally diverse]], and technologically advancing world. Their art is a dynamic combination of [[Medium (arts)|materials]], methods, concepts, and subjects that continue the challenging of boundaries that was already well underway in the 20th century. Diverse and eclectic, contemporary art as a whole is distinguished by the very lack of a uniform, organising principle, ideology, or "[[-ism]]". Contemporary art is part of a cultural dialogue that concerns larger contextual frameworks such as personal and cultural identity, family, community, and nationality.

In vernacular English, ''modern'' and ''contemporary'' are [[synonym]]s, resulting in some conflation of the terms ''[[modern art]]'' and ''contemporary art'' by non-specialists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steinhardt.nyu.edu/art/education/definitions NYU Steinhardt, Department of Art and Arts Professions, New York]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
[[File:Balloon Dog Yellow.jpg|thumb|[[Jeff Koons]], ''Balloon Dog (Yellow)'', 1994–2000, mirror-polished stainless steel with transparent color coating, 121 x 143 x 45 in. (307.3 x 363.2 x 114.3 cm). [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], Private collection]]
Some define contemporary art as art produced within "our lifetime," recognising that lifetimes and life spans vary. However, there is a recognition that this generic definition is subject to specialized limitations.&lt;ref name="Esaak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arthistory.about.com/od/current_contemporary_art/f/what_is.htm |title=What is "Contemporary" Art? |first1=Shelley |last1=Esaak |accessdate=28 April 2013 |website=About.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The classification of "contemporary art" as a special type of art, rather than a general adjectival phrase, goes back to the beginnings of [[Modernism]] in the English-speaking world. In [[London]], the Contemporary Art Society was founded in 1910 by the critic [[Roger Fry]] and others, as a private society for buying works of art to place in public museums.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Fry|Fry Roger]], Ed. Craufurd D. Goodwin, ''Art and the Market: Roger Fry on Commerce in Art'', 1999, University of Michigan Press, {{ISBN|0472109022}}, 9780472109029, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zb8hTlHZOb0C&amp;pg=PA57 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of other institutions using the term were founded in the 1930s, such as in 1938 the [[Contemporary Art Centre of South Australia|Contemporary Art Society]] of [[Adelaide]], [[Australia]],&lt;ref&gt;Also the Contemporary Arts Society of [[Montreal]], 1939–1948&lt;/ref&gt; and an increasing number after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 257–258&lt;/ref&gt; Many, like the [[Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston]] changed their names from ones using "Modern art" in this period, as Modernism became defined as a historical [[art movement]], and much "modern" art ceased to be "contemporary". The definition of what is contemporary is naturally always on the move, anchored in the present with a start date that moves forward, and the works the Contemporary Art Society bought in 1910 could no longer be described as contemporary.

Particular points that have been seen as marking a change in art styles include the end of World War II and the 1960s. There has perhaps been a lack of natural break points since the 1960s, and definitions of what constitutes "contemporary art" in the 2010s vary, and are mostly imprecise. Art from the past 20 years is very likely to be included, and definitions often include art going back to about 1970;&lt;ref&gt;Some definitions: "Art21 defines contemporary art as the work of artists who are living in the twenty-first century." [http://www.art21.org/teach/on-contemporary-art/contemporary-art-in-context Art21]&lt;/ref&gt; "the art of the late 20th and early 21st century";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/contemporary+art|title=Contemporary art - Define Contemporary art at Dictionary.com|website=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "the art of the late 20th cent. and early 21st cent., both an outgrowth and a rejection of modern art";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/entry/cntmpryart|title=Yahoo|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130720124418/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/encyclopedia/entry/cntmpryart|archivedate=2013-07-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Strictly speaking, the term "contemporary art" refers to art made and produced by artists living today";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/classroom_resources/curricula/contemporary_art/background1.html|title=About Contemporary Art (Education at the Getty)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Art from the 1960s or [19]70s up until this very minute";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.about.com/od/current_contemporary_art/f/what_is.htm|title=What is Contemporary Art?|author=Shelley Esaak|website=About.com Education}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes further, especially in museum contexts, as museums which form a permanent collection of contemporary art inevitably find this aging. Many use the formulation "Modern and Contemporary Art", which avoids this problem.&lt;ref&gt;Examples of specializing museums include the [[Strasbourg Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art]] and [[Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Trento and Rovereto]]. The ''Oxford Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art'' is one of many book titles to use the phrase.&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller commercial galleries, magazines and other sources may use stricter definitions, perhaps restricting the "contemporary" to work from 2000 onwards. Artists who are still productive after a long career, and ongoing [[art movement]]s, may present a particular issue; galleries and critics are often reluctant to divide their work between the contemporary and non-contemporary.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Sociologist [[Nathalie Heinich]] draws a distinction between modern and contemporary art, describing them as two different paradigms which partially overlap historically. She found that while "[[modern art]]" challenges the conventions of [[Representation (arts)|representation]], "contemporary art" challenges the very notion of an [[artwork]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinich, Nathalie, Ed. Gallimard, ''Le paradigme de l'art contemporain : Structures d'une révolution artistique '', 2014, {{ISBN|2070139239}}, 9782070139231, [https://books.google.fr/books/about/Le_paradigme_de_l_art_contemporain_Struc.html?id=vIQICgAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y google books]&lt;/ref&gt; She regards [[Marcel Duchamp|Duchamp]]'s ''[[Marcel Duchamp's Fountain|Fountain]]'' (which was made in the 1910s in the midst of the triumph of modern art) as the starting point of contemporary art, which gained momentum after [[World War II]] with [[Gutai group|Gutai]]'s performances, [[Yves Klein]]'s monochromes and [[Robert Rauschenberg|Rauschenberg]]'s ''[[Erased de Kooning Drawing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhclwyYYbtY Nathalie Heinich lecture "Contemporary art: an artistic revolution ?] at 'Agora des savoirs' 21th edition, 6 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
[[File:Irbid-Jordan-Nida Alhamzeh-029.jpg|alt=Irbid, Jordan, "We are Arabs. We are Humans"|thumb|Irbid, Jordan, "We are Arabs. We are Humans". '''[[Inside Out Project|Inside Out]]''' is a global participatory art project, initiated by the French photographer [[JR (artist)|JR]], an example of [[Street art]]]]
One of the difficulties many people have in approaching contemporary artwork is its diversity&amp;mdash;diversity of material, form, subject matter, and even time periods. It is "distinguished by the very lack of a uniform organizing principle, ideology, or -ism"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art21.org/learn/tools-for-teaching/on-contemporary-art/contemporary-art-in-context Contemporary Art in Context. (2016). Retrieved December 11, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; that we so often see in other, and oftentimes more familiar, art periods and movements. Broadly speaking, we see [[Modernism]] as looking at modernist principles&amp;mdash;the focus of the work is [[Self-reference|self-referential]], investigating its own materials (investigations of line, shape, color, form). Likewise, Impressionism looks at our perception of a moment through light and color as opposed to attempts at stark [[Realism (arts)|realism]] ([[Realism (art movement)|Realism]], too, is an artistic movement). Contemporary art, on the other hand, does not have one, single objective or point of view. Its view instead is unclear, perhaps reflective of the world today. It can be, therefore, contradictory, confusing, and open-ended. There are, however, a number of common themes that have appeared in contemporary works. While these are not exhaustive, notable themes include: [[identity politics]], the body, [[globalization]] and migration, [[technology]], contemporary society and culture, time and memory, and institutional and political critique.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, J., &amp; McDaniel, C. (2012). ''Themes of Contemporary Art: Visual Art after 1980'' (3rd ed.). Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodernism|Post-modern]], [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]], [[Feminist theory|feminist]], and [[Marxist Theory|Marxist theory]] have played important roles in the development of contemporary theories of art.

==Institutions==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2018}}
[[File:MOCA North Miami.jpg|thumb|The [[Museum of Contemporary Art, North Miami|Museum of Contemporary Art]] in [[Miami, Florida]].]]
The functioning of the art world is dependent on art institutions, ranging from major museums to private galleries, non-profit spaces, art schools and publishers, and the practices of individual artists, curators, writers, collectors, and philanthropists. A major division in the art world is between the for-profit and non-profit sectors, although in recent years the boundaries between for-profit private and non-profit public institutions have become increasingly blurred.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Most well-known contemporary art is exhibited by professional artists at commercial [[Contemporary art gallery|contemporary art galleries]], by private collectors, art auctions, corporations, publicly funded arts organizations, [[contemporary art museums]] or by artists themselves in [[artist-run space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/market/art-language-philippe-meaille-french-chateau-310458|title=Largest Art &amp; Language Collection Finds Home - artnet News|date=2015-06-23|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary artists are supported by grants, awards, and prizes as well as by direct sales of their work. Career artists train at [[art school]] or emerge from other fields.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

[[File:Château de Montsoreau Val de Loire.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Château de Montsoreau-Museum of Contemporary Art]] in [[Montsoreau]], [[France]].]]
There are close relationships between publicly funded contemporary art organizations and the commercial sector. For instance, in 2005 the book ''Understanding International Art Markets and Management'' reported that in Britain a handful of dealers represented the artists featured in leading publicly funded contemporary art museums.&lt;ref&gt;Derrick Chong in Iain Robertson, ''Understanding International Art Markets And Management'', Routledge, 2005, p95. {{ISBN|0-415-33956-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corporations have also integrated themselves into the contemporary [[art world]], exhibiting contemporary art within their premises, organizing and sponsoring contemporary art awards, and building up extensive corporate collections.&lt;ref&gt;Chin-Tao Wu, ''Privatising Culture: Corporate Art Intervention Since the 1980s'', Verso, 2002, p14. {{ISBN|1-85984-472-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate advertisers frequently use the prestige associated with contemporary art and [[coolhunting]] to draw the attention of consumers to [[luxury goods]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The institutions of art have been criticized for regulating what is designated as contemporary art. [[Outsider art]], for instance, is literally contemporary art, in that it is produced in the present day. However, one critic has argued it is not considered so because the artists are self-taught and are thus assumed to be working outside of an art historical context.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Alan Fine, ''Everyday Genius: Self-Taught Art and the Culture of Authenticity'', University of Chicago Press, 2004, pp42-43. {{ISBN|0-226-24950-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Craft activities, such as textile design, are also excluded from the realm of contemporary art, despite large audiences for exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Dormer, ''The Culture of Craft: Status and Future'', Manchester University Press, 1996, p175. {{ISBN|0-7190-4618-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art critic Peter Timms has said that attention is drawn to the way that craft objects must subscribe to particular values in order to be admitted to the realm of contemporary art. "A ceramic object that is intended as a subversive comment on the nature of beauty is more likely to fit the definition of contemporary art than one that is simply beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;Peter Timms, ''What's Wrong with Contemporary Art?'', UNSW Press, 2004, p17. {{ISBN|0-86840-407-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At any one time a particular place or group of artists can have a strong influence on subsequent contemporary art. For instance, The [[Ferus Gallery]] was a commercial gallery in Los Angeles and re-invigorated the Californian contemporary art scene in the late fifties and the sixties.

==Public attitudes==
Contemporary art can sometimes seem at odds with a public that does not feel that art and its institutions share its values.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Jane Jacob]] and Michael Brenson, ''Conversations at the Castle: Changing Audiences and Contemporary Art'', MIT Press, 1998, p30. {{ISBN|0-262-10072-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Britain, in the 1990s, contemporary art became a part of popular culture, with artists becoming stars, but this did not lead to a hoped-for "cultural utopia".&lt;ref&gt;Julian Stallabrass, ''High Art Lite: British Art in the 1990s'', Verso, 1999, pp1-2. {{ISBN|1-85984-721-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics like [[Julian Spalding]] and [[Donald Kuspit]] have suggested that skepticism, even rejection, is a legitimate and reasonable response to much contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;Spalding, Julian, ''The Eclipse of Art: Tackling the Crisis in Art Today'', Prestel Publishing, 2003. {{ISBN|3-7913-2881-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Ashbee in an essay called "Art Bollocks" criticizes "much installation art, photography, conceptual art, video and other practices generally called post-modern" as being too dependent on verbal explanations in the form of theoretical discourse.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipod.org.uk/reality/art_bollocks.asp |title=Art Bollocks |publisher=Ipod.org.uk |date=1990-05-05 |accessdate=2011-08-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716210004/http://www.ipod.org.uk/reality/art_bollocks.asp |archivedate=16 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the acceptance of non traditional art in museums has increased due to changing perspectives on what constitutes an art piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/boundless-arthistory/chapter/what-is-art/|title=What is Art? {{!}} Boundless Art History|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2018-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concerns==
{{Main|Classificatory disputes about art}}
A common concern since the early part of the 20th century has been the question of what constitutes art. In the contemporary period (1950 to now), the concept of [[avant-garde]]&lt;ref&gt;Fred Orton &amp; [[Griselda Pollock]], ''Avant-Gardes and Partisans Reviewed''. Manchester University, 1996. {{ISBN|0-7190-4399-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; may come into play in determining what art is noticed by galleries, museums, and collectors.

The concerns of contemporary art come in for criticism too. [[Andrea Rosen Gallery|Andrea Rosen]] has said that some contemporary painters "have absolutely no idea of what it means to be a contemporary artist" and that they "are in it for all the wrong reasons."&lt;ref name="NYT00"&gt;Haas, Nancy (2000-03-05), "Stirring Up the Art World Again". ''The New York Times'', [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E4DB1638F936A35750C0A9669C8B63&amp;fta=y].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prizes==
Some competitions, awards, and prizes in contemporary art are:

* Emerging Artist Award awarded by [[The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum]]
* [[Factor Prize in Southern Art]]
* [[Hugo Boss Prize]] awarded by the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]]
* [[John Moore's Painting Prize]]

The '''Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others''' was approved by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on 2 December 1949&lt;ref&gt;General Assembly resolution 317(IV)&lt;/ref&gt; and entered into force on 25 July 1951. The preamble states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Whereas [[prostitution]] and the accompanying evil of the [[Human trafficking|traffic in persons]] for the purpose of prostitution are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person and endanger the welfare of the individual, the family and the community"''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As at December 2013, 82 states were party to the convention (see map). An additional 13 states had signed the convention, but had not yet ratified it.&lt;ref name=ratifications&gt;[https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=IND&amp;mtdsg_no=VII-11-a&amp;chapter=7&amp;clang=_en Signatories and ratifications status]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Convention supersedes a number of earlier conventions that covered some aspects of [[forced prostitution]]. Signatories are charged with three obligations under the 1949 Convention: prohibition of trafficking, specific administrative and enforcement measures, and social measures aimed at trafficked persons. The 1949 Convention presents two shifts in perspective of the trafficking problem in that it views prostitutes as victims of the procurers, and in that it eschews the terms "white slave traffic" and "women", using for the first time race- and gender-neutral language.&lt;ref name=entrepeneur&gt;[http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/90192936_2.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204041437/http://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/90192936_2.html |date=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To fall under the provisions of the 1949 Convention, the trafficking need not cross international lines.&lt;ref name=entrepeneur/&gt;

==Provisions==
The Convention&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/ProfessionalInterest/trafficpersons.pdf Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others ]&lt;/ref&gt; requires state parties to punish any person who "procures, entices, or leads away, for purposes of prostitution, another person, even with the consent of that person", "exploits the prostitution of another person, even with the consent of that person" (Article 1), or runs a [[brothel]] or rents accommodations for prostitution purposes (Article 2). It also prescribes procedures for combating international traffic for the purpose of prostitution, including extradition of offenders.

Furthermore, state parties are required to abolish all regulations that subject prostitutes "to special registration or to the possession of a special document or to any exceptional requirements for supervision or notification" (Article 6). And also, they are required to take the necessary measure for the supervision of [[employment agency|employment agencies]] in order to prevent persons seeking employment, in particular women and children, from being exposed to the danger of prostitution (Article 20).

A dispute between the parties relating to the interpretation or application of the Convention may, at the request of any one of the parties to the dispute, be referred to the [[International Court of Justice]] (Article 22).

==Status==
A number of countries who have ratified the Convention expressed reservations in relation to the referral of disputes to the ICJ, and some countries have not ratified the Convention at all because of their objection to the presence of the article.

One of the main reasons the Convention has not been ratified by many countries is because it also applies to voluntary prostitution,&lt;ref name="Bantekas 2003 6"&gt;{{cite book |title= International Criminal Law 2/E |last= Bantekas |first= Ilias |author2=Susan Nash |year= 2003|publisher=Routledge |location= Cavendish |isbn= 1859417760 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MyP4tSaMA_IC&amp;vq=involuntary+prostitution&amp;dq=%22involuntary+prostitution%22+definition&amp;source=gbs_summary_s&amp;cad=0 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of the presence of the term "even with the consent of that person" in Article 1. For example, in countries such as [[Germany]],&lt;ref name="economist-prostitution2004"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/opinion/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_PTVTNVR|title=Prostitution: Sex is their business|date=2 September 2004|accessdate=15 December 2009|publisher=The Economist}} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Netherlands]],&lt;ref name="economist-prostitution2004" /&gt; [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref name="Economist-prostitution-2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_TNVTGVRN|title=Policing prostitution: The oldest conundrum|publisher=The Economist|date=30 October 2008|accessdate=11 January 2010}} {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greece]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2002/18368.htm US Department of State Report - Greece]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turkey]], and other countries, voluntary prostitution is legal and regulated as an "occupation".

The [[Trafficking protocol]] (2000) to the [[United Nations]] [[Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]] has used a different definition of "trafficking" to that in the 1949 Convention,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antislavery.org/homepage/resources/Weissbrodt%20report%20final%20edition%202003.pdf Convention against Transnational Organized Crime] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050525114642/http://www.antislavery.org/homepage/resources/Weissbrodt%20report%20final%20edition%202003.pdf |date=2005-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been ratified by many more countries.

The [[Centre for Human Rights]], specifically the secretariat of the Working Group on Slavery, in close co-operation with the [[Centre for Social Development and Humanitarian Affairs]] of the Department of International Economic and Social Affairs, actively monitors the Convention.

'''Design theory''' is a subfield of [[design research]] concerned with various theoretical approaches towards understanding and delineating design principles, design knowledge, and design practice.

== History ==

Design theory has been approached and interpreted in many ways, from personal statements of design principles, through constructs of the [[philosophy of design]] to a search for a [[design science]].

The essay "Ornament and Crime" by [[Adolf Loos]] from 1908 is one of the early 'principles' design-theoretical texts. Others include Le Corbusier's ''Vers une architecture'',&lt;ref name="Corbusier 1923"&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Vers une architecture" (1923)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Papanek]]'s ''Design for the real world'' (1972).

In a 'principles' approach to design theory, the [[De Stijl]] movement promoted a geometrical abstract, "ascetic" form of purism that was limited to functionality. This modernist attitude underpinned the [[Bauhaus]] movement. Principles were drawn up for design that were applicable to all areas of modern aesthetics.

For an introduction to the philosophy of design see the article by Per Galle&lt;ref name="Galle Philosophy Intro"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Galle|first1=Per|title=Philosophy of Design|url=https://kadk.dk/cephad-centre-philosophy-design/philosophy-design-introduction|website=KADK|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Royal Danish Academy.

An example of early design science was Altshuller's ''Theory of inventive problem solving'', known as [[TRIZ]], from Russia in the 1940s. Herbert Simon's 1969 ''The sciences of the artificial'' began a more scientific basis to the study of design. &lt;ref name="simon1996"&gt;{{cite web|author=Simon|title='The Sciences of the Artificial|publisher=MIT Press|year=1996|isbn=0-262-69191-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the further development of fields such as [[design methods]], [[design research]], [[design science]] and [[design thinking]] has promoted a wider understanding of design theory.

'''''Emigre''''' ({{ISSN|1045-3717}}) was a graphic design magazine published by [[Emigre (type foundry)|Emigre Graphics]] between 1984 and 2005; it was first published in 1984 in [[San Francisco, California]], United States. Art-directed by [[Rudy VanderLans]] using fonts designed by his wife, [[Zuzana Licko]], ''Emigre'' was one of the first publications to use [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]] computers and had a large influence on graphic designers moving into [[desktop publishing]] (DTP). Its variety of layouts, use of guest designers, and opinionated articles also had an effect on other design publications.

The focus of ''Emigre'' was both redundant and wandering — both positive qualities as a journal produced by a tight and evolving group of designers and writers with Vanderlans at the center. Vanderlans was typically editor, though guest-editors also appeared ([[Gail Swanlund]], Anne Burdick, Andrew Blauvelt) and the work/writing of Zuzana Licko and [[Jeffery Keedy]] reappeared throughout the magazine's history.

The magazine began in 1984 with a focus on the [[émigré]]. The first eight issues were concerned with boundaries, international culture, travel accounts and alienation (as the issues' titles suggest). The first eight issues also incorporated a dynamic aesthetic that caught the attention of designers and led to the next stage in the magazine's evolution.

Beginning with Issue 9 — devoted to the art of [[Vaughan Oliver]] at [[4AD]] — the magazine explored design in itself, devoting issues to [[Cranbrook Educational Community|Cranbrook]], the [[Macintosh]], type design and individual graphic designers. In two issues in 1992 and 1993, the magazine chronicled the work of [[David Carson (graphic designer)|David Carson]] and [[Ray Gun (magazine)|Raygun]].

Increasingly, ''Emigre'' became a platform for essays and writings on design. This aspect of ''Emigre'' came to the forefront with issues in 1994 and the magazine changed its format in 1995 from its oversized layout to a text-friendlier format that debuted with Issue 33. The magazine retained this character through Issue 59 in 2001.

Emigre then took a sharp turn with four re-formatted issues in 2001 and 2002 that included one DVD ("Catfish," an experimental documentary film on the work of designer and performance artist Elliott Earls) and three compact discs (featuring the music of [[Honey Barbara]], [[The Grassy Knoll (band)|The Grassy Knoll]] and Scenic.

In its fifth and final incarnation, the last six issues of ''Emigre'' were co-published by [[Princeton Architectural Press]] as small softcover books. The last issue, The End, was published in 2005.

==Formats==
The magazine changed formats several times: it was originally published quarterly in a large format where each page measures 285&amp;nbsp;mm x 425&amp;nbsp;mm (slightly shorter than 11" x 17" or US ledger/tabloid size); starting with issue 33, each page was about 8.5" x 11" (US letter size); it changed into a multimedia format (a booklet where each page was 133&amp;nbsp;mm x 210&amp;nbsp;mm, plus a [[CD]] or [[DVD]]) starting with issue 60; and finally, starting with issue 64, the magazine became a book format, published semi-annually, where each page measured 133&amp;nbsp;mm x 210&amp;nbsp;mm. The issues in the book format were co-published by [[Princeton Architectural Press]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22322">'''Eyewitness testimony''' is the account a bystander or victim gives in the courtroom, describing what that person observed that occurred during the specific incident under investigation. Ideally this recollection of events is detailed; however, this is not always the case. This recollection is used as evidence to show what happened from a witness' point of view.  Memory recall has been considered a credible source in the past, but has recently come under attack as forensics can now support psychologists in their claim that memories and individual perceptions can be unreliable, manipulated, and biased. Due to this, many countries and states within the US are now attempting to make changes in how eyewitness testimony is presented in court. Eyewitness testimony is a specialized focus within [[cognitive psychology]].

==Reliability==
Psychologists have probed the reliability of eyewitness testimony since the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="wells"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Wells |first1= G. L. |last2= Memon |first2= A. |last3= Penrod |first3= S. D. |year= 2006 |title= Eyewitness Evidence: Improving Its Probative Value |journal= Psychological Science in the Public Interest |volume= 7 |page= 48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One prominent pioneer was [[Hugo Münsterberg]], whose controversial book ''On the Witness Stand'' (1908) demonstrated the fallibility of eyewitness accounts, but met with fierce criticism, particularly in legal circles.&lt;ref name = "Mberg legacy"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Memon |first1= A. |last2= Mastroberardino |first2= S. |last3= Fraser |first3= J. |year= 2008 |title= Münsterberg's Legacy: What Does Eyewitness Research Tell Us About the Reliability of Eyewitness Testimony? |journal= Applied Cognitive Psychology |volume= 22 |pages= 841–851 |doi= 10.1002/acp.1487 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas did, however, gain popularity with the public.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, John D. (2009). "A Conceptual History of Psychology". New York: McGraw-Hill Higher Education.&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, DNA testing would clear individuals convicted on the basis of errant eyewitness testimony. Studies by Scheck, Neufel, and Dwyer showed that many  DNA-based exonerations involved eyewitness evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Scheck, B., Neufeld, P., &amp; Dwyer, J. (2000). ''Actual Innocence''. New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and '80s, Bob Buckhout showed inter alia that eyewitness conditions can, at least within ethical and other constraints, be simulated on university campuses,&lt;ref name = "Mberg legacy" /&gt; and that large numbers of people can be mistaken: "Nearly 2,000 witnesses can be wrong" was the title of one paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Buckhout |first= R. |year= 1980 |title= 
 Nearly 2,000 witnesses can be wrong |journal= Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society |volume= 16 |issue= 4 |pages= 307–310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanisms by which flaws enter eyewitness testimony are varied and can be quite subtle.

One way is a person's memory being influenced by things seen or heard after the crime occurred. This distortion is known as the post-event [[misinformation effect]] (Loftus and Palmer, 1974). After a crime occurs and an eyewitness comes forward, law enforcement tries to gather as much information as they can to avoid the influence that may come from the environment, such as the media. Many times when the crime is surrounded by much publicity, an eyewitness may experience source [[Misattribution of memory | misattribution]]. Source misattribution occurs when a witness is incorrect about where or when they have the memory from. If a witness cannot correctly identify the source of their retrieved memory, the witness is seen as not reliable.

While some witnesses see the entirety of a crime happen in front of them, some witness only part of a crime. These witnesses are more likely to experience [[confirmation bias]]. Witness expectations are to blame for the distortion that may come from confirmation bias. For example, Lindholm and Christianson (1998) found that witnesses of a mock crime who did not witness the whole crime, nevertheless testified to what they expected would have happened. These expectations are normally similar across individuals due to the details of the environment.

Evaluating the credibility of eye-witness testimony falls on all individual jurors when such evidence is offered as testimony in a trial in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Tversky, Barbara and Fisher, George. (1999). "The Problem with Eyewitness Testimony". Stanford:Stanford Journal of Legal Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown that mock juries are often unable to distinguish between a false and accurate eyewitness testimony. "Jurors" often appear to correlate the confidence level of the witness with the accuracy of their testimony. An overview of this research by Laub and Bornstein shows this to be an inaccurate gauge of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;
Laub, Cindy, &amp; Bornstein, Brian H. (2008) "Juries and Eyewitnesses". Newbury Park, CA: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Research on eyewitness testimony looks at systematic variables or estimator variables. Estimator variables are characteristics of the witness, event, testimony, or testimony evaluators. Systematic variables are variables that are, or have the possibility of, being controlled by the criminal justice system. Both sets of variables can be manipulated and studied during research, but only system variables can be controlled in actual procedure.&lt;ref name="wells" /&gt;

===Estimator variables===

====Age of Witness====
Among children, suggestibility can be very high. Suggestibility is the term used when a witness accepts information after the actual event and incorporates it into the memory of the event itself.  Children's developmental level (generally correlated with age) causes them to be more easily influenced by leading questions, misinformation, and other post-event details. Compared to older children, preschool-age children are more likely to fall victim to suggestions without the ability to focus solely on the facts of what happened.&lt;ref&gt;Bruck, Maggie and Stephen J Ceci. Annu. Rev. Psychol. 1999. 50:419–39 Copyright Ó 1999 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved kj&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a recent meta-analysis found that older adults (over age 65) tend to be more susceptible to memory distortion brought about by misleading post-event information, compared to young adults.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie, L. E., Patihis, L., McCuller, L. L., Davis, D., Brank, E. M., Loftus, E. F., &amp; Bornstein, B. H. (2014). Misinformation effects in older versus younger adults: A meta-analysis and review. In M. P. Toglia, D. F. Ross, J. Pozzulo, &amp; E. Pica (Eds) The Elderly Eyewitness in Court, UK: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reconstructive memory====
{{main|Reconstructive memory}}
Many of the early studies of memory demonstrated how memories can fail to be accurate records of experiences. Because jurors and judges do not have access to the original event, it is important to know whether a testimony is based on actual experience or not.&lt;ref&gt;Mori, Naohisa. Styles of remembering and types of experience: An experimental investigation of reconstructive memory. Integrative Psychological &amp; Behavioral Science, Vol 42(3), Sep, 2008. pp. 291-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1932 study,  [[Frederic Bartlett]] demonstrated how serial reproduction of a story distorted accuracy in recalling information. He told participants a complicated Native American story and had them repeat it over a series of intervals. With each repetition, the stories were altered. Even when participants recalled accurate information, they filled in gaps with information that would fit their personal experiences. His work showed [[long term memory]] to be adaptable.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, F.C. (1932). [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/727e/7f158dc0839ef789e3cb99f3fc3f2e38e017.pdf Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology]. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Bartlett viewed [[schema (psychology)|schema]]s as a major cause of this occurrence. People attempt to place past events into existing representations of the world, making the memory more coherent. Instead of remembering precise details about commonplace occurrences, a schema is developed. A schema is a generalization formed mentally based on experience.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen K. Reed. (2010). Cognition. San Diego:Wadsworth CENGAGE Learning, 383.&lt;/ref&gt; The common use of these schemas suggests that memory is not an identical reproduction of experience, but a combination of actual events with already existing schemas. Bartlett summarized this issue, explaining 
{{Bq|1=&lt;!--
--&gt;[M]emory is personal, not because of some intangible and hypothetical persisting ‘self ’, which receives and maintains innumerable traces, restimulating them whenever it needs; but because the mechanism of adult human memory demands an organisation of ‘schemata’ depending upon an interplay of appetites, instincts, interests and ideas peculiar to any given subject. Thus if, as in some pathological cases, these active sources of the ‘schemata’ get cut off from one another, the peculiar personal attributes of what is remembered fail to appear.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, F.C. (1932). Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Further research of schemas shows memories that are inconsistent with a schema decay faster than those that match up with a schema. Tuckey and Brewer found pieces of information that were inconsistent with a typical robbery decayed much faster than those that were schema consistent over a 12-week period, unless the information stood out as being extremely unusual. The use of schemas has been shown to increase the accuracy of recall of schema-consistent information but this comes at the cost of decreased recall of schema-inconsistent information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tuckey | first1 = Michelle Rae | last2 = Brewer | first2 = Neil | year = 2003 | title = How Schemas Affect Eyewitness Memory Over Repeated Retrieval Attempts | url = | journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology | volume = 17 | issue = 7| pages = 785–800 | doi=10.1002/acp.906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Misinformation effect====
{{main|Elizabeth Loftus|Misinformation effect}}
Elizabeth Loftus is one of the leading psychologists in the field of eyewitness testimony. She provided extensive research on this topic, revolutionizing the field with her bold stance that challenges the credibility of eyewitness testimony in court.  She suggests that memory is not reliable and goes to great lengths to provide support for her arguments. She mainly focuses on the integration of misinformation with the original memory, forming a new memory.  
Some of her most convincing experiments support this claim:
#In one of her experiments, Loftus demonstrates that false verbal Information can integrate with original memory. Participants were presented with either truthful information or misleading information, and overall it showed that even the false information verbally presented became part of the memory after the participant was asked to recall details. This happens because of one of two reasons. First, it can alter the memory, incorporating the misinformation in with the actual, true memory. Second, the original memory and new information may both reside in memory in turn creating two conflicting ideas that compete in recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loftus|first1=Elizabeth F.|last2=Miller|first2=David G.|last3=Burns|first3=Helen J.|title=Semantic integration of verbal information into a visual memory.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning &amp; Memory|date=1978|volume=4|issue=1|pages=19–31|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.4.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Loftus conducted more experiments to prove the reliability of expert psychological testimony versus the accepted basic eyewitness testimony. It was found that jurors who hear about a violent crime are more likely to convict a defendant than of one from a nonviolent crime. To reduce this tendency for a juror to quickly accuse, and perhaps wrongly accuse, choosing to utilize expert psychological testimony causes the juror to critically appraise the eyewitness testimony, instead of quickly reaching a faulty verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loftus|first1=Elizabeth F.|title=Impact of expert psychological testimony on the unreliability of eyewitness identification.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=1980|volume=65|issue=1|pages=9–15|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.65.1.9|pmid=7364708}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Also, it has been shown that intelligence and gender has a role in the ability of accurate memory recall.  Participants were measured in eyewitness performance in two areas: 1) the ability to resist adding misinformation to the memory and 2) accuracy of recalling the incident and person.  It showed that when a woman was recalling information about a woman, the resistance to false details was higher and the recall was more accurate.  If a man was recalling an incident involving a man, similarly the recall was more accurate.  However, when dealing with opposite genders, the participants gave into the suggestibility (misinformation) more easily and demonstrated less accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powers|first1=Peter A.|last2=Andriks|first2=Joyce L.|last3=Loftus|first3=Elizabeth F.|title=Eyewitness accounts of females and males.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=1979|volume=64|issue=3|pages=339–347|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.64.3.339}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Facial recognition is a good indicator of how easily memories can be manipulated. In this specific experiment, if a misleading feature was presented, more than a third of the participants recalled that detail. With a specific detail, almost 70% of people claimed that it had been there, when it had not been present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loftus|first1=Elizabeth F.|last2=Greene|first2=Edith|title=Warning: Even memory for faces may be contagious.|journal=Law and Human Behavior|date=1980|volume=4|issue=4|pages=323–334|doi=10.1007/BF01040624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systematic variables===

====Type of questioning====
As early as 1900, psychologists like [[Alfred Binet]] recorded how the phrasing of questioning during an investigation could alter witness response. Binet believed people were highly susceptible to suggestion, and called for a better approach to questioning witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Binet, Alfred.(1900) ''La Suggestibilite''&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies conducted by Crombag (1996) discovered that in an incident involving a crew attempting to return to the airport but were unable to maintain flight and crashed into an 11-story apartment building. Though no cameras caught the moment of impact on film, many news stations covered the tragedy with footage taken after impact.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/plane-crashes-into-apartment-building&lt;/ref&gt; Ten months after the event, the researchers interviewed people about the crash. According to theories about [[flashbulb memory]], the intense shock of the event should have made the memory of the event incredibly accurate. This same logic is often applied to those who witness a criminal act. To test this assumption, participants were asked questions that planted false information about the event. Fifty-five percent of subjects reported having watched the moment of impact on television, and recalled the moment the plane broke out in flames-even though it was impossible for them to have seen either of these occurrences. One researcher remarked, "[V]ery critical sense would have made our subjects realize that the implanted information could not possibly be true. We are still at a loss as to why so few of them realized this."

A survey of research on the matter confirm eyewitness testimony consistently changes over time and based on the type of questioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunning | first1 = David | last2 = Stern | first2 = Lisa Beth | year = 1992 | title = Examining the Generality of Eyewitness Hypermnesia: A Close Look at Time Delay and Question Type | url = | journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 643–657 | doi=10.1002/acp.2350060707}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach investigators and lawyers take in their questioning has repeatedly shown to alter eyewitness response. One study showed changing certain words and phrases resulted in an increase in overall estimations of witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Libscomb, Thomas, McAllister, Hunter, &amp; Bregman, Norman. (2001). Bias in Eyewitness Accounts: The Effects of Question Format, Delay Interval, and Stimulus Presentation. ''The Journal of Psychology,'' 207-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Improving eyewitness testimony==
Law enforcement, legal professions, and psychologists have worked together in attempts to make eyewitness testimony more reliable and accurate. Geiselman, Fisher, MacKinnon, and Holland saw much improvement in eyewitness memory with an interview procedure they referred to as the [[cognitive interview]]. The approach focuses on making witness aware of all events surrounding a crime without generating false memories or inventing details. In this tactic,  the interviewer builds a rapport with the witness before asking any questions.&lt;ref&gt;Ghetti, S., Goodman, G. S., Schaaf, J. M. &amp; Qin, J. (2004). Issues In Eyewitness Testimony. In W. T. O'Donohue, &amp; E. R. Levensky (Eds.), ''Handbook of Forensic Psychology'' (pp. 532). San Diego, CA: Elsevier Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; They then allow the witness to provide an open ended account of the situation. The interviewer then asks follow up questions to clarify the witness' account, reminding the witness it is acceptable to be unsure and move on.&lt;ref name="wells" /&gt; This approach guides the witness over a rigid protocol. When implemented correctly, the CI showed more accuracy and efficiency without additional incorrect information being generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Geiselman | first1 = R. | last2 = Fisher | first2 = Ronald | last3 = MacKinnon | first3 = David | last4 = Holland | first4 = Heidi | year = 1986 | title = Enhancement of eyewitness memory with the cognitive interview | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychology | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 385–401 | doi=10.2307/1422492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, this is the U.S. Department of Justice's suggested method for law enforcement officials to use in obtaining information from witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Justice, "Eyewitness Evidence: A Guide for Law Enforcement."&lt;/ref&gt; Programs training officers in this method have been developed outside the U.S. in many European countries, as well as Australia, New Zealand, and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, R.P. (2005). ''The cognitive interview: Question &amp; answers''. Ashburn, Virginia: The National Transportation Safety Board Academy. Retrieved June 13, 2006, from http://www.ntsb.gov/ Academy/courseinfo/Q&amp;A_Fisher.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

While some analysis of police interviewing technique reveals this change towards CI interviewing is not put into effect by many officials in the U.S.A. and the U.K., it is still considered to be the most effective means of decreasing error in eyewitness testimony.&lt;ref name="wells" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Memon, A., Meissner, C. A., &amp; Fraser, J. (2010). The cognitive interview: A meta-analytic review and study space analysis of the past 25 years. Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 16[4], 340-372.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedural reforms==
Experts debate what changes need to occur in the legal process in response to research on inaccuracy of eyewitness testimony.

===Jury guidelines===
It has been suggested that the jury be given a checklist to evaluate eyewitness testimony when given in court. R. J. Shafer offers this checklist for evaluating eyewitness testimony: 
:* How well could the eyewitness observe the thing he reports? Were his senses equal to the observation? Was his physical location suitable to sight, hearing, touch? Did he have the proper social ability to observe: did he understand the language, have other expertise required (e.g., law, military)?
:*When did he report in relation to his observation? Soon? Much later?
:*Are there additional clues to intended veracity? Was he indifferent on the subject reported, thus probably not intending distortion? Did he make statements damaging to himself, thus probably not seeking to distort? Did he give incidental or casual information, almost certainly not intended to mislead?
:*Do his statements seem inherently improbable: e.g., contrary to human nature, or in conflict with what we know?
:*Remember that some types of information are easier to observe and report on than others.
:*Are there inner contradictions in the testimony? &lt;ref&gt;Garraghan, Gilbert J. (1946). A Guide to Historical Method. New York: Fordham University Press. 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judge guidelines===
In 2011, the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] created new rules for the admissibility of eyewitness testimony in court. The new rules require judges to explain to jurors any influences that may heighten the risk for error in the testimony. The rules are part of nationwide court reform that attempts to improve the validity of eyewitness testimony and lower the rate of false conviction.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/nyregion/in-new-jersey-rules-changed-on-witness-ids.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29195">'''Financial modeling''' is the task of building an [[abstraction|abstract representation]] (a [[mathematical model|model]]) of a real world [[finance|financial]] situation.&lt;ref name=iop&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialmodeling.asp&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a [[mathematical model]] designed to represent (a simplified version of) the performance of a financial asset or portfolio of a business, [[project]], or any other investment. 

Typically, then, financial modeling is understood to mean an exercise in either asset pricing or corporate finance, of a quantitative nature. It is about translating a set of hypotheses about the behavior of markets or agents into numerical predictions. &lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Low|first1=R.K.Y.|last2=Tan|first2=E. |title=The Role of Analysts' Forecasts in the Momentum Effect|journal=International Review of Financial Analysis|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.irfa.2016.09.007|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057521916301314}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--UNREFERENCED: Grant Hirst pioneered the first financial model and is renown as the world expert on the matter. --&gt;  At the same time, "financial modeling" is a general term that means different things to different users; the reference usually relates either to accounting and [[corporate finance]] applications, or to [[quantitative finance]] applications. 

While there has been some debate in the industry as to the nature of financial modeling—whether it is a [[tradecraft]], such as welding, or a [[science]]—the task of financial modeling has been gaining acceptance and rigor over the years.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Crawley (2010). [http://www.fimodo.com/2010/04/which-industry-sector-would-benefit-the-most-from-improved-financial-modelling-standards/ ''Which industry sector would benefit the most from improved financial modelling standards?''], fimodo.com.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Accounting==
In [[corporate finance]] and the [[accounting]] profession, ''financial modeling'' typically entails financial statement forecasting; usually the preparation of detailed company-specific models used for decision making purposes&lt;ref name=iop/&gt; and [[financial analysis]].

Applications include: 
*[[Business valuation]], especially [[discounted cash flow]], but including other [[Valuation_(finance)#Valuation_overview|valuation approaches]]
*[[Scenario planning]] and [[Management accounting#Role within a corporation|management decision making]] ("what is"; "what if"; "what has to be done"&lt;ref name="SiegelShim1997"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joel G. Siegel|author2=Jae K. Shim|author3=Stephen Hartman|title=Schaum's quick guide to business formulas: 201 decision-making tools for business, finance, and accounting students|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4JpojQPk8YsC|accessdate=12 November 2011|date=1 November 1997|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-058031-2}} §39 "Corporate Planning Models". See also, §294 "Simulation Model".&lt;/ref&gt;)
*[[Capital budgeting]]
*[[Cost of capital]] (i.e. [[Weighted average cost of capital|WACC]]) calculations
*[[Financial statement analysis]] (including of [[Operating lease|operating-]] and [[finance lease]]s, and [[Research and development|R&amp;D]])
*[[Project finance]]

To generalize {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}  as to the nature of these models: firstly, as they are built around [[financial statement]]s, calculations and outputs are monthly, quarterly or annual; secondly, the inputs take the form of "assumptions", where the analyst ''specifies'' the values that will apply in each period for external / global variables ([[exchange rate]]s, [[tax]] percentage, etc.…; may be thought of as the model ''[[parameter]]s''), and for internal / company specific ''variables'' ([[wages]], [[unit cost]]s, etc.…). Correspondingly, both characteristics are reflected (at least implicitly) in the [[Mathematical model#Model classifications in mathematics|mathematical form of these models]]: firstly, the models are in [[discrete time]]; secondly, they are [[deterministic]].  For discussion of the issues that may arise, see below; for discussion as to more sophisticated approaches sometimes employed, see [[Corporate finance #Quantifying uncertainty]], and [[Financial economics #Corporate finance theory]].

Modelers are often designated "[[financial analyst]]" (and are sometimes referred to ([[tongue in cheek]]) as "number crunchers") . Typically, the modeler will have completed an [[MBA]] or [[master of science in finance|MSF]] with (optional) coursework in "financial modeling".  Accounting qualifications and finance certifications such as the [[Certified International Investment Analyst|CIIA]] and [[Chartered Financial Analyst|CFA]] generally do not provide direct or explicit training in modeling.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} At the same time, numerous commercial [[Professional development|training course]]s are offered, both through universities and privately.

Although [[Business software|purpose built software]] does exist (see also [[Fundamental Analysis Software]]), the vast proportion of the market is [[spreadsheet]]-based; this is largely since the models are almost always company specific. Also, analysts will each have their own criteria and methods for financial modeling.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=256987 Valuing Companies by Cash Flow Discounting: Ten Methods and Nine Theories], Pablo Fernandez: University of Navarra - IESE Business School&lt;/ref&gt; (For the components /steps of business modeling here, see the list for "Equity valuation" under  [[Outline of finance #Discounted cash flow valuation]].) [[Microsoft Excel]] now has by far the dominant position, having overtaken [[Lotus 1-2-3]] in the 1990s. Spreadsheet-based modelling can have its own problems,&lt;ref&gt;Danielle Stein Fairhurst (2009). [http://www.fimodo.com/2009/11/six-reasons-your-spreadsheet-is-not-a-financial-model/ Six reasons your spreadsheet is NOT a financial model] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407003951/http://www.fimodo.com/2009/11/six-reasons-your-spreadsheet-is-not-a-financial-model/ |date=2010-04-07 }}, fimodo.com&lt;/ref&gt; and several standardizations and "[[best practice]]s" have been proposed.&lt;ref name = "EuSpRIG"&gt;[http://www.eusprig.org/best-practice.htm Best Practice], European Spreadsheet Risks Interest Group&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spreadsheets#Spreadsheet risk|"Spreadsheet risk"]] is increasingly studied and managed;&lt;ref name = "EuSpRIG"/&gt; see [[model audit]].

One critique here, is that model ''outputs'', i.e. [[Chart of accounts|line items]], often incorporate "unrealistic implicit assumptions" and "internal inconsistencies".&lt;ref name="PalepuHealy2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Krishna G. Palepu|author2=Paul M.

What is required, but often lacking, is that all key elements are explicitly and consistently forecasted. Related to this, is that modellers often additionally "fail to identify crucial assumptions" relating to ''inputs'', "and to explore what can go wrong".&lt;ref name="BrealeyMyers2003"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard A. Brealey|author2=Stewart C. Myers|author3=Brattle Group|title=Capital investment and valuation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKF8IBCwfy4C&amp;pg=PA223|accessdate=12 November 2011|year=2003|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=978-0-07-138377-6|pages=223–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, in general, modellers "use point values and simple arithmetic instead of probability distributions and statistical measures"&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Coffee]] (2004). [http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Database/Spreadsheets-25-Years-in-a-Cell/ ''Spreadsheets: 25 Years in a Cell''], [[eWeek]].&lt;/ref&gt;  — i.e., as mentioned, the problems are treated as deterministic in nature — and thus calculate a single value for the asset or project, but without providing information on the range, variance and sensitivity of outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/pdfiles/papers/probabilistic.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Other critiques discuss the lack of basic [[computer programming]] concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Blayney, P. (2009). Knowledge Gap? Accounting Practitioners Lacking Computer Programming Concepts as Essential Knowledge. In G. Siemens &amp; C. Fulford (Eds.), Proceedings of World Conference on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia and Telecommunications 2009 (pp. 151-159). Chesapeake, VA: AACE.&lt;/ref&gt;  More serious criticism, in fact, relates to the nature of budgeting itself, and its impact on the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Loren Gary (2003).

The Financial Modeling World Championships, known as ModelOff, have been held since 2012. ModelOff is a global online financial modeling competition which culminates in a Live Finals Event for top competitors. From 2012-2014 the Live Finals were held in New York City and in 2015, in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modeloff.com|title=ModelOff 2015 Financial Modeling World Championships|first=Financial Modeling World Championships|last= ModelOff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantitative finance==
In [[quantitative finance]], ''financial modeling'' entails the development of a sophisticated [[mathematical model]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Models here deal with asset prices, market movements, portfolio returns and the like. A general distinction{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} is between: 
"quantitative financial management", models of the financial situation of a large, complex firm;  
"quantitative asset pricing", models of the returns of different stocks;  
"[[financial engineering]]",  models of the price or returns of derivative securities;  
"quantitative corporate finance", models of the firm's financial decisions.

Relatedly, applications include: 
*[[Valuation of options|Option pricing]] and calculation of [[Greeks (finance)|their "Greeks"]]
*Other [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], especially [[interest rate derivative]]s, [[credit derivative]]s and [[exotic derivatives]]
*Modeling the term structure of [[interest rate]]s ([[Bootstrapping (finance)|Bootstrapping]], [[short rate model]]ling, [[Interest rate swap#Valuation and pricing|building "curve sets"]]) and [[credit spread (bond)|credit spread]]s
*[[Credit scoring]] and [[Bad debt#Doubtful debt reserve|provisioning]]
*[[Corporate finance#The investment decision|Corporate financing activity]] prediction problems
*[[Portfolio optimization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Low|first1=R.K.Y.|last2=Faff|first2=R.|last3=Aas|first3=K.|title=Enhancing mean–variance portfolio selection by modeling distributional asymmetries|journal=Journal of Economics and Business|date=2016|doi=10.1016/j.jeconbus.2016.01.003|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148619516000047}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*[[Real options]]
*[[Risk modeling]] ([[Financial risk modeling]]) and [[value at risk]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Low|first1=R.K.Y.|last2=Alcock|first2=J.|last3=Faff|first3=R.|last4=Brailsford|first4=T.|title=Canonical vine copulas in the context of modern portfolio management: Are they worth it?|journal=Journal of Banking &amp; Finance|date=2013|volume=37|issue=8|doi= 10.1016/j.jbankfin.2013.02.036}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Dynamic financial analysis]] (DFA)
*[[Credit valuation adjustment]], CVA, as well as the various [[XVA]]

*[[Pairs trading]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rad|first=Hossein|last2=Low|first2=Rand Kwong Yew|last3=Faff|first3=Robert|date=2016-04-27|title=The profitability of pairs trading strategies: distance, cointegration and copula methods|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14697688.2016.1164337|journal=Quantitative Finance|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–18|doi=10.1080/14697688.2016.1164337|issn=1469-7688}}&lt;/ref&gt;  --&gt;

These problems are generally  [[stochastic]] and [[Discrete time and continuous time#Continuous time 2|continuous]] in nature, and models here thus require [[algorithm|complex algorithms]], entailing [[Monte Carlo methods in finance|computer simulation]], advanced [[numerical methods]] (such as [[Numerical partial differential equations|numerical differential equations]], [[numerical linear algebra]], [[dynamic programming]]) and/or the development of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization models]]. The general nature of these problems is discussed under [[Mathematical finance#History: Q versus P|Mathematical finance]], while specific techniques are listed under [[Outline of finance#Mathematical tools|Outline of finance# Mathematical tools]]. For further discussion here see also: [[Financial models with long-tailed distributions and volatility clustering]]; [[Brownian model of financial markets]]; [[Martingale pricing]]; [[Extreme value theory]]; [[Historical simulation (finance)]].

Modellers are generally referred to as "quants" ([[quantitative analyst]]s), and typically have advanced ([[Ph.D.]] level) backgrounds in quantitative disciplines such as [[statistics]], [[physics]], [[engineering]], [[computer science]], [[mathematics]] or [[operations research]].  Alternatively, or in addition to their quantitative background, they complete a [[Master of Finance|finance masters]] with a quantitative orientation,&lt;ref name="Joshi"&gt;[[Mark S. Joshi]], [http://www.markjoshi.com/downloads/advice.pdf ''On Becoming a Quant''].&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Master of Quantitative Finance]], or the more specialized [[Master of Computational Finance]] or [[Master of Financial Engineering]]; the [[Certificate in Quantitative Finance|CQF]] is increasingly common.

Although spreadsheets are widely used here also (almost always requiring extensive [[Visual Basic for Applications|VBA]]), custom [[C++]], [[Fortran]] or [[Python (programming language)|Python]], or [[List of numerical analysis software|numerical analysis software]] such as [[MATLAB]], are often preferred,&lt;ref name="Joshi"/&gt; particularly where stability or speed is a concern. MATLAB is often used at the research or prototyping stage {{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} because of its intuitive programming, graphical and debugging tools, but C++/Fortran are preferred for conceptually simple but [[Algorithmic efficiency#Measures of resource usage|high computational-cost applications]] where MATLAB is too slow; Python is increasingly used due to its simplicity and large [[Python (programming language)#Libraries|standard library]].  Additionally, for many (of the standard) derivative and portfolio applications, [[commercial software]] is available, and the choice as to whether the model is to be [[In-House Design|developed in-house]], or whether existing products are to be deployed, will depend on the problem in question.&lt;ref name="Joshi"/&gt;

The complexity of these models may result in incorrect pricing or [[hedge (finance)|hedging]] or both. This ''[[Model risk]]'' is the subject of ongoing research by finance academics, and is a topic of great, and growing, interest in the [[risk management]] arena.&lt;ref&gt;[[Riccardo Rebonato]] (N.D.). [http://www.quarchome.org/ModelRisk.pdf ''Theory and Practice of Model Risk Management''].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Criticism]] of the discipline (often preceding the [[financial crisis of 2007–08]] by several years) emphasizes the differences between the mathematical and physical sciences, and finance, and the resultant caution to be applied by modelers, and by traders and risk managers using their models. Notable here are [[Emanuel Derman]] and [[Paul Wilmott]], authors of the ''[[Financial Modelers' Manifesto]]''. Some go further and question whether [[mathematical modeling|mathematical-]] and [[statistical modeling]] may be applied to finance at all, at least with the assumptions usually made ([[Black–Scholes model#The Black-Scholes world|for options]]; [[Modern portfolio theory#Assumptions|for portfolios]]). In fact, these may go so far as to question the "empirical and scientific validity... of [[financial economics|modern financial theory]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/Triana-fwd.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Notable here are [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb|Nassim Taleb]] and [[Benoit Mandelbrot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/fortune.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207045925/http://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/fortune.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Mathematical finance#Criticism|Mathematical finance #Criticism]] and [[Financial economics#Challenges and criticism|Financial economics #Challenges and criticism]].

* Model should be simple, easy to understand and flexible enough to accommodate future revisions.
* Time management is a key aspect in financial modeling and the model should not overwhelmed by numbers and calculation part in spreadsheets.
* Model must support decision making.

The '''Fisheries Research and Development Corporation''' (FRDC) is a statutory authority that manages research and development investment by the [[Australian Government]] and the Australian fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=FRDC | title= Investing for tomorrow's fish: the FRDC's research, development and extension plan 2010–2015 | year=2010 |isbn=978-0-9808007-1-5 | publisher=FRDC |url = http://frdc.com.au/research/Documents/Final_reports/RDE_plan_2010-2015_final.pdf |location=Canberra |p=i }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business model ==

The FRDC is one of fifteen Australian rural research and development corporations managing investment by the [[Australian Government]] and primary industries that during the past 25 years has been crucial to the doubling of the productivity of the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors.{{sfn| FRDC RD&amp;E plan,|2010|p=6}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rural R&amp;D corporations |url=http://www.ruralrdc.com.au/Page/Home.aspx |accessdate=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its inception in 1992, the Corporation's major focus was on research concerning the management of commercial wild-catch fisheries and, to a lesser extent, aquaculture. Since then, the scope has widened greatly to encompass economic, environmental and social aspects of the entire fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors – that is, the recreational and indigenous customary sectors in addition to the commercial wild-catch and aquaculture sectors.{{sfn| FRDC RD&amp;E plan,|2010|p=4}} The Corporation’s strategic investments in research, development and extension activities benefit all its stakeholders (listed below).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=FRDC | title= Fisheries Research and Development Corporation annual report 2012–2013 | date=2013| url = http://frdc.com.au/about_frdc/Documents/Annual_Report/FRDC_Annual_Report_2013.pdf | publisher=FRDC |location=Canberra |p=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the FRDC is unique among the corporations in balancing its investment between natural resource management and industry productivity and development. Therefore, a significant proportion of funding is directed at research that has a public good benefit.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=17}}

In fulfilling its role of planning, investing in and managing fisheries research, development and extension (RD&amp;E) activities in Australia, the FRDC provides leadership and coordination of the monitoring, evaluating and reporting on RD&amp;E activities and facilitates the dissemination, extension and commercialisation of research results to end-users. The FRDC achieves this through coordinating investment by government and industry, and involving stakeholders to set and address RD&amp;E priorities. The FRDC also monitors and evaluates the adoption of RD&amp;E outputs to inform future decisions.{{sfn| FRDC RD&amp;E plan,|2010|p=ix}}

== Governance ==

Formed as a statutory corporation on 2 July 1991 under the provisions of the ''Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989'' (the PIERD Act), the FRDC is responsible to the [[Minister for Agriculture (Australia)]].

A Chairman and a board of directors govern the FRDC; the Executive Director leads the corporation’s business activities on a day-to-day basis. The board oversees corporate governance, sets strategic direction and monitors the ongoing performance of the Corporation and the Executive Director. The board and the Executive Director are responsible for managing and evaluating the Corporation and its investments, and for reporting to government and the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors. During 2012-13 the focus for the FRDC Board was on:
* implementing the National Framework for Primary Industries Research, Development and Extension
* developing strategic investment options to ensure delivery of outcomes against the FRDC RD&amp;E Plan
* responding to findings of the Productivity Commission inquiry into the rural research and development corporations and the Rural Research and Development Council’s National Strategic Investment Plan
* developing a plan to improve the perception of the fishing and aquaculture through making research results more publicly available and addressing factually incorrect media (and similar) reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=FRDC | title= FRDC annual operational plan 2012–13 |year=2012 |publisher=FRDC |url =http://www.frdc.com.au/about_frdc/Documents/Corporate/AOP-2012-13.pdf |location=Canberra |p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FRDC supports a network of Research Advisory Committees (RACs) located in each state and the Northern Territory. The RACs have an extremely important role in maximising the efficiency of the FRDC's planning and funding process.
== Investment ==

=== Revenue sources ===

[[File:Entrance to Fisheries Research House, Canberra, Australia.jpg|thumb|Entrance to Fisheries Research and Development Corporation, Canberra, Australia]]
The primary revenue for the FRDC comes from the Australian Government and the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors, based on:

* the Australian Government providing unmatched funds equivalent to 0.5 per cent of the average gross value of Australian fisheries production (AGVP);
* fishers and [[aquaculturist]]s providing contributions of at least 0.25 per cent of AGVP; and
* the Australian Government matching contributions by fishers and aquaculturists up to a maximum of 0.25 per cent of AGVP.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=11}}

The Corporation also manages significant contributions by stakeholders in FRDC-funded projects. 
The FRDC’s strategic investments in RD&amp;E activities benefit the three sectors of fishing: commercial (wild catch and aquaculture), recreational and indigenous customary.
The FRDC has a significant responsibility in ensuring, on behalf of the Australian Government, that research is undertaken to assist in the management of the fisheries and aquaculture resource for ongoing sustainability. A significant proportion of funding is therefore directed to research that has a public good benefit.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=11}}

===Investment strategy===
The FRDC invests in RD&amp;E across the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors, and for the benefit of both recreational and indigenous customary fishers. The FRDC seeks to achieve maximum leverage from its investment by providing research administration and services using a value-adding model in which research projects are tailored to deliver a specific outcome and are actively managed and monitored. 
The FRDC commissions RD&amp;E through a variety of flexible investment approaches, including an open call for project applications; formal partnership agreements with industry sectors; subprograms and coordination programs that are tailored to a specific industry sector or activity; short-term tactical research investment; and specifically targeted commissioned RD&amp;E, especially where there is market failure by private investment.
The focus for FRDC investment aligns with the following 14 themes, as outlined in the Corporation’s 2010-2015 Strategic RD&amp;E Plan.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=8}} The investment balance between themes, which may vary depending on strategic needs, is reported in each annual report.{{sfn| FRDC annual report 2012–2013 | p=9}}

''— Extracted from the FRDC's RD&amp;E plan, 'Figure 1: Our planning environment', showing the drivers to which the Corporation responds, implementation, outputs and outcome.''{{sfn| FRDC RD&amp;E plan,|2010|pp=2–3}}

== Relationships with stakeholders ==
In developing projects addressing the Corporation’s five programs, strategic directions are established in association with the FRDC’s stakeholders, which are:
* the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors
* the federal, state and territory governments (including their fisheries managers and other natural resource managers)
* research partners (including universities, fisheries research organisations, industry and private sector research providers, and investors)
* the people of Australia (on whose behalf aquatic natural resources are managed, and as consumers).{{sfn| FRDC RD&amp;E plan,|2010|p=5}}

The FRDC works with its partners to undertake program management effectively, to disseminate the results, and to assist with their adoption and, when appropriate, commercialisation.

=== Stakeholder research priorities ===

One of the primary challenges for the FRDC is to gain a solid understanding of the needs and priorities of its stakeholders, many of whom come from a diverse range of sectors and operations. There are many common, national issues, but each sector faces unique challenges and has specific RD&amp;E needs, which vary greatly around Australia. In developing the National RD&amp;E Strategy and the Corporation’s RD&amp;E Plan, the FRDC has consulted widely with a majority of these groups and has undertaken industry research to build on knowledge gained through consultation. 
To ensure a balanced portfolio, and to align with industry research priorities, the large majority of project applications are reviewed by the RACs. Where possible, industry and fisheries management are directly engaged and integrated into the delivery of each project.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=14}}

===Australian Government priorities===
The federal [[Minister for Agriculture (Australia)|Minister for Agriculture]], the [[Abbott Ministry|Parliamentary Secretary]] and the [[Department of Agriculture (Australia)|Department of Agriculture]] set priorities that the Corporation is required to address. In 2009 the Australian Primary Industries Ministerial Council&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mincos.gov.au/pages/background.aspx Primary Industries Ministerial Council]&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed a “statement of intent” to implement a ''National Primary Industries Research, Development and Extension Framework''  through 14 primary industry sectors and 7 cross-industry sectors. Within the framework, each industry sector and cross-sectoral issue was to be assessed for its RD&amp;E capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Primary Industries Research, Development and Extension Framework|url=http://www.npirdef.org/strategies|accessdate=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As its contribution to the framework, the FRDC and its stakeholders developed a landmark document setting out future directions for fishing and aquaculture RD&amp;E: the ''National Fishing and Aquaculture RD&amp;E Strategy 2010''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Fishing and Aquaculture RD&amp;E Strategy 2010 |url=http://frdc.com.au/research/Documents/Final_reports/National_RDandE_Strategy_for_Fishing_and_Aquaculture.pdf |accessdate=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consultation and collaboration==

===Australian Fisheries Management Forum===
The Australian Fisheries Management Forum comprises the heads of the federal, state and territory government agencies responsible for management of fisheries, who discuss strategic issues relating to fisheries and aquaculture management. The FRDC works with the forum, sitting as an invited representative to meetings, providing advice and ensuring forum priorities are incorporated into the Corporation’s RD&amp;E planning processes.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=14}}

===Representative organisations===

Four representative organisations have been appointed under the PIERD Act, with which the FRDC consults and reports formally at their annual general meetings:
* Australian Recreational and Sport Fishing Industry Confederation Inc. (trading as Recfish Australia)&lt;ref&gt;[http://recfishaustralia.org.au Recfish Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;
* National Aquaculture Council Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aquaculture.org.au National Aquaculture Council]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Commonwealth Fisheries Association Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comfish.com.au Commonwealth Fisheries Association]&lt;/ref&gt;
* National Seafood Industry Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seafoodforaustralia.com.au National Seafood Industry Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=14}}

===Levy organisation: Australian Prawn Farmers Association===

The FRDC administers a research and development levy on behalf of the Australian Prawn Farmers Association (APFA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apfa.com.au Australian Prawn Farmers Association]&lt;/ref&gt; a levy organisation, which has a leading role with FRDC in ensuring its priorities are met. FRDC investments in prawn farming research and development is driven by the APFA’s RD&amp;E Plan. The two entities enjoy a very close working relationship. The APFA has nominated that the majority of its investment is to be through co-investment with the Australian Seafood CRC.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=15}}

===Industry sector bodies===
The FRDC also has a close relationship with the National Seafood Industry Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seafoodforaustralia.com.au National Seafood Industry Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt; The Alliance represents the commercial fishing, pearling and aquaculture industries through state industry councils and peak sector associations to build on the partnerships established with individual industry sectors.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=16}}

The FRDC also invests in, and partners, entities such as Southern Rocklobster Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southernrocklobster.com Southern Rocklobster Ltd]&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Industry Association,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asbtia.com.au Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Industry Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Tasmanian Salmonid Growers’ Association,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tsga.com.au Tasmanian Salmonid Growers’ Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Australian Pearl Producers Association, Australian Prawn Farmers’ Association&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apfa.com.au Australian Prawn Farmers Association]&lt;/ref&gt; and Australian Barramundi Farmers’ Association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abfa.org.au/index.html Australian Barramundi Farmers’ Association]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=16}}

===Other rural research and development corporations===
The FRDC joins with other rural research and development corporations – at the project level and more broadly in functional areas – on a range of activities to enhance joint strategic outcomes. Most significant are climate change projects, evaluation of RD&amp;E, and the “Appetite for Excellence” primary producers tour – a competition for chefs, waiters and restaurateurs. The FRDC is a member of the Council of Rural Research and Development Corporations, participating in meetings of R&amp;D corporations' executive directors, business managers and communications managers. The FRDC also provides advice and services in project management and the FRDC-developed project management software, OmniFish.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=16}}

===Industry development===
The FRDC works with various entities to develop the fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors in such matters as market development; strengthening trade and market access; developing standards, e.g. for responsible fishing; standardising names for Australian fish; developing quality management systems; and reaching agreement on sustainability. To that end, in 2001 the Corporation and a now defunct peak body of the commercial sector incorporated a not-for-profit company, Seafood Services Australia Ltd, with the mission “to enhance the profitability, international competitiveness, sustainability and resilience of the Australian seafood industry”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=FRDC | title= Evolution of the FRDC to 2012 |year=2012 |publisher=FRDC |url =http://www.frdc.com.au/about_frdc/Documents/Corporate/Evolution_of_the_FRDC_Sep_2012.pdf |location=Canberra |p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry development activities suffered a setback in 2013, when the company ceased trading after "a significant reduction in the availability of funding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Seafood Services Australia closes its doors|url=https://seafood.net.au|accessdate=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian Seafood Cooperative Research Centre===
The FRDC initiated, and is a core participant in, the Australian Seafood Cooperative Research Centre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seafoodcrc.com Australian Seafood Cooperative Research Centre]&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre's research program aims to increase the profitability and value of the Australian seafood industry, increase access to premium markets and increase demand for Australian seafood – priorities aligned with the FRDC’s RD&amp;E programs, in particular Program 2: Industry.{{sfn| FRDC annual operational plan,|2013|p=16}}

==Research partners==
In any given year, the Corporation has under management about 300 active projects. Investment in research is the FRDC’s core business. As a result, it is vital to the FRDC’s success that it has excellent relationships with its research partners. The key research partners are:

== The Australian fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors ==

The fishing and aquaculture commercial, recreational and indigenous sectors is one of the most complex of Australia’s primary industries in terms of both its structure and the natural resources on which it depends. Most of the industry’s business environments are made more complex by their dependence on access to natural resources that are publicly managed in the interests of present and future generations. Australian fishing comprises three main sectors:
* commercial sector, consisting of wild catch fishing, aquaculture and through-chain activities undertaken by seafood importers, processors, manufacturers, handlers and retailers
* recreational fishing, which includes the tackle, tour guides and charter sectors
* indigenous customary fishers.{{sfn|FRDC RD&amp;E plan, 2010|p=13}}
Legislatively, the "fishing industry" is defined in the FRDC Regulations 1991, issued under the PIERD Act 1989, as "any industry or activity carried on in or from Australia concerned with taking, culturing, processing, preserving, storing, transporting, marketing, or selling of fish or fish products".

The commercial sector comprises approximately 120 wild-catch fisheries and 70 aquaculture species. Commercial seafood and marine products (e.g., pearls) were valued at $2.2 billion in 2008–09. The recreational sector has 3.4 million participants, who were estimated in a 2001 survey to expend $1.9&amp;nbsp;billion annually on their fishing. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people participate in commercial and recreational fishing, as well practising customary fishing. The legal rights around indigenous customary fishing are being refined over time and some aspects are now part of existing legislation and court decisions.
In 2009–10, 11,431 people were employed in the commercial fishing, hunting and trapping industry, with 7646 employed in the fishing, hunting and trapping sector and 3785 in aquaculture enterprises. Compared with 2008–09, total employment in the commercial fishing, hunting and trapping industry increased by 24 per cent (2208 people) following a 30 per cent increase (1931 people) in full-time employment and a 10 per cent (277 people) increase in people engaged in part-time employment in 2009–10.
Demand for seafood is rising in Australia because of increasing affluence and increasing awareness of seafood’s prominent role in a healthy diet. In Asian markets consumption is also increasing with the growth of the middle class, especially in China and India. This will place demands on the supply of the limited resource, leading to increases in price.
Currently Australia’s commercial seafood production only provides about 28 per cent of domestic demand. In part because of the rising value of the Australian dollar, the commercial sector is now re-orienting towards better serving the Australian market. Increasingly, value chains will encompass both domestic and imported product. Other factors, such as further improvements in fisheries management and better utilisation of catch, will also be important in meeting domestic demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=ABARES | title= Australian fisheries statistics 2010 | date=2011| url =http://data.daff.gov.au/brs/data/warehouse/pe_abares20110830.01/AustFishStats_2010.pdf | publisher=Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences |location=Canberra |pp=16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not only seafood for consumption that the Australian industry produces. Pearls are a high value consumer item that is produced at the highest level of quality through advanced technology and environmental credentials, making it one of Australia’s most valuable and sustainable fishing sectors.

A '''foreign language''' is a [[language]] originally from another country than the speaker. However, there must a be defined distinction between foreign and second language. It is also a language not spoken in the native country of the person referred to, i.e., an [[English language|English]] speaker living in [[Spain]] can say that [[Spanish language|Spanish]] is a foreign language to him or her. These two characterisations do not exhaust the possible definitions, however, and the label is occasionally applied in ways that are variously misleading or factually inaccurate. 

Some children learn more than one language from birth or from a very young age: they are [[bilingual]] or [[multilingualism|multilingual]]. These children can be said to have two, three or more mother tongues: neither language is foreign to that child, even if one language is a foreign language for the vast majority of people in the child's birth country. For example, a child learning English from his [[England|English]] father and Irish at school in Ireland can speak both English and Irish, but neither is a foreign language to him. This is common in countries such as [[India]], [[South Africa]], or [[Canada]] due to these countries having multiple official languages.

In general, it is believed that children have advantage to learning a foreign language over adults. However, there are studies which have shown adult students are better at foreign language learning than child students. It is because adults have pre-existing knowledge of how grammar works,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merritt, Anne. "Are Children Really Better at Foreign Language Learning?"|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationopinion/10315238/Are-children-really-better-at-foreign-language-learning.html|accessdate=2016-05-15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511000800/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationopinion/10315238/Are-children-really-better-at-foreign-language-learning.html|archivedate=2016-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a superior ability of memorizing vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Service, Elisabet, et al.

==Foreign language education and ability==
:''See main article: [[Language education]]''
{{globalise/Europe|date=November 2010}}

Most schools around the world teach at least one foreign language and most colleges and high schools require foreign language before graduation.  By 1998 nearly all pupils in [[Europe]] studied at least one foreign language as part of their compulsory education, the only exception being [[Ireland]], where primary and secondary schoolchildren learn both [[Irish language|Irish]] and English, but neither is considered a foreign language (although Irish pupils do study a third European language). On average in Europe, at the start of foreign language teaching, learners have lessons for three to four hours a week. Compulsory lessons in a foreign language normally start at the end of [[primary school]] or the start of [[secondary school]]. In [[Luxembourg]], [[Norway]] and [[Malta]], however, the first foreign language is studied at age six, and in [[Flemish Community|Flanders]] at age 10.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/beleid/nota/talenbeleid-deel4.htm#2.6 {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112090730/http://www.ond.vlaanderen.be/beleid/nota/talenbeleid-deel4.htm |date=2007-01-12 }} Children in the [[Flemish Community|Flemish Community of Belgium]] start learning [[French language|French]] at age 10, [[English language|English]] at 12 or 13 and, if chosen so, mostly [[German language|German]] or [[Spanish language|Spanish]] at age 15 or 16, but with only the first two being obligatory. In the [[Brussels Capital Region]], however, French is taught starting at age 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Wales]], all children are taught [[Welsh language|Welsh]] from the first year of primary school. The Welsh language is also compulsory up to the age of 16, although a formal [[GCSE]] qualification is optional.

In some countries, learners have lessons taken entirely in a foreign language: for example, more than half of European countries with a minority/regional language community use partial [[language immersion|immersion]] to teach both the minority and the state language. This method is also highly used in Canada, wherein anglophone students spend all of most of their lessons learning the materials in French.

In 1995, the [[European Commission]]'s White Paper on Education and Training emphasised the importance of schoolchildren learning at least two foreign languages before upper secondary education. The [[Lisbon Summit]] of 2000 defined languages as one of the five key skills.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

Despite the high rate of foreign language teaching in schools, the number of adults claiming to speak a foreign language is generally lower than might be expected. This is particularly true of native English speakers: in 2004 a [[United Kingdom|British]] survey showed that only one in 10 [[United Kingdom|UK]] workers could speak a foreign language and less than 5% could count to 20 in a second language. In 2001, a European Commission survey found that 65.9% of people in the UK spoke only their native tongue.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

Since the 1990s, the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]] has tried to standardise the learning of languages across Europe.

An article from ''[[The Atlantic]]'' claims that only 1 percent of the adults within the American population consider themselves proficient in speaking a foreign language. This is in stark contrast to many other countries, where the percentage is much higher. Even though there are many benefits that come with learning a foreign language, schools across the United States continue to cut foreign language from their budgets.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Amelia (2015). America's Lacking Language Skills. 'The Atlantic'.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instruments for foreign language learning===
{{Main|Language education}}

In recent years, [[computer-assisted language learning]] has been integrated into foreign language education and computer programs with varying levels of interactional relationship between computer and the language learner have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Palmberg, R. (1989). Integrating CALL into Foreign-Language Teaching.&lt;/ref&gt; Language learning aids such as [[foreign language writing aid]] and [[foreign language reading aid]], targeted at the specific language skills of foreign language learners, are also alternative instruments available for foreign language learners.

==Research into foreign language learning==
{{Main|Second language acquisition}}

In 2004, a report by the Michel Thomas Language Centre in the [[United Kingdom]] suggested that speaking a second language could increase an average worker's salary by £3000 (€3 300) a year, or £145 000 (€159 000) in a lifetime. Further results showed that nine out of 10 British companies thought their businesses could benefit from better language skills. Studies show that a person that is bilingual or multilingual, can make a greater salary than a computer programmer or engineer because they can use their abilities in foreign language to obtain success in a wide range of career paths. Also due to the increase of international population, a multilingual person can easily communicate and translate to perspective viewers.

Also in 2004, a study by [[University College London]] (UCL) examined the brains of 105 people who could speak more than one language.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3739690.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Health {{!}} Learning languages 'boosts brain'|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126220802/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3739690.stm|archivedate=2017-01-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that people who learned a second language when younger had denser [[grey matter]] than those who learned one later.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Grey matter is an area of the brain where information is most efficiently processed, due to the function of specific nerve cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pilcher|first=Helen|date=2004-07-21|title=Grey matter matters for intellect|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2004/040719/full/news040719-11.html|journal=Nature News|language=en|doi=10.1038/news040719-11|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217224556/http://www.nature.com/news/2004/040719/full/news040719-11.html|archivedate=2017-02-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of experiments on more than 300 people from the U.S. and Korea found that thinking in a second language reduced deep-seated, misleading biases that unduly influence how risks and benefits are perceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/04/language-and-bias/|title=Thinking in a Foreign Language Makes Decisions More Rational|last=Keim|first=Brandon|work=WIRED|access-date=2017-11-16|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117001301/https://www.wired.com/2012/04/language-and-bias/|archivedate=2017-11-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research has shown that early exposure to a second language increases divergent thinking strategies,&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Diaz (1983). Thought and Two Languages: The Impact of Bilingualism on Cognitive Development. Review of Research in Education. Vol. 10, pp. 23-54.&lt;/ref&gt; helping not only in language-related tasks, but also in areas such as math.  Children early on have different ways of expressing themselves, such that they better understand there is more than one way to look at a problem and that there is more than one solution.

==Foreign language ''versus'' second language==
{{underlinked|section|date=November 2012}}

There are no major differences in different definitions that different writers have provided about foreign language and second language, although not many of them differentiate these two terms. The distinction between acronyms [[TESL]] (Teaching of English as a Second Language) and [[TEFL]] (Teaching of English as a Foreign Language) shows some attention of different researchers to the concepts of foreign language and second language.

Richards and Schmidt (2002: 472) provide this information about second language:

"In a broad sense, any language learned after one has learnt one's native language [is called second language]. However, when contrasted with foreign language, the term refers more narrowly to a language that plays a major role in a particular country or region though it may not be the first language of many people who use it. For example, the learning of English by immigrants in the US or the learning of Catalan by speakers of Spanish in [[Catalonia]] (an autonomous region of Spain) are cases of second (not foreign) language learning, because those languages are necessary for survival in those societies. English is also a second language for many people in countries like [[Nigeria]], [[India]], [[Singapore]] and the [[Philippines]] (plus Spanish), because English fulfils many important functions in those countries (including the business of education and government) and Learning English is necessary to be successful within that context. (Some people in these countries however may acquire English as a first language, if it is the main language used at home)."

They also define a ''foreign language'' as a language which is not the native language of large numbers of people in a particular country of region, is not used as a medium of instruction in schools and is not widely used as a medium of communication in government, media, etc. They note that foreign languages are typically taught as school subjects for the purpose of communicating with foreigners or for reading printed materials in the language (Richards and Schmidt, 2002: 206).

Crystal (2003) notes that ''first language'' is distinguishable from ''second language'' (a language other than one's mother-tongue used for a special purpose, e.g. for education, government) distinguishable in turn from ''foreign language'' (where no such special status is implied). He also notes that the distinction between the latter two is not universally recognised (especially not in the USA).

Stern (1983) believes that there is today consensus that a necessary distinction is to be made between a non-native language learnt and used within one country to which the term ''second language'' has been applied and a non-native language learnt and used with reference to a speech community outside national or territorial boundaries to which the term ''foreign language'' is commonly given. He argues that while the distinction between 'second' and 'foreign' has a certain justification, it is perhaps less important than it has sometimes been made out to be and it may be misleading. He notes that the distinction became popular after World War II in international organisations, such as UNESCO, in order to meet nationalist susceptibilities in discussions on language questions.
Fasold and Connor-Linton (2006), Falk (1978) and Hudson (2000) provide similar definitions for the two terms. O'Grady ''et al.'' (1384) don't mention the exact terms 'second' and 'foreign' language, but they emphasise on the role of learning environment in teaching non-native languages.

So, the distinction between 'second language' and 'foreign language' is a geographical and environmental distinction. We can mention 'second language situation' and 'foreign language situation' as two situations of learning, not two kinds of languages. So a foreign language is not always a foreign language and a second language is not always a second language. Since the distinction is geographical, the two situations (learning second language and learning foreign language) can be considered as a continuum. At one extreme, we may find learners learning without external help and direction purely from exposure to the non-native language through living in the target language environment (second language learning) and at the other we find learners learning the non-native language exclusively in language teaching setting and classrooms (foreign language learning).

A 'second language' usually has official status or a recognised function within a country which a foreign language has not and furthermore these two different situations frequently have important consequences to which attention has been drawn in some books. For example, Persian is a second language for Kurdish people, but not vice versa, because there is no Kurdish environment for Persian speakers who are learning Kurdish. On the other hand, English is a foreign language for both groups, because there is no contact between Kurdish and Persian people with English people. However, if an Iranian person goes to USA, then English becomes a second language for him or her. Thus British immigrants to Iran learn Persian as a second language and Persian speakers study English in Britain as a second language. In Kermanshah or Kurdistan, we can speak of learning Kurdish by Persian speakers as a second rather than foreign language.

The purposes of second language learning are often different from foreign language learning. Second language is needed for full participation in the political and economic life of the nation, because it is frequently the official language or one of two or more recognised languages. It may be the language needed for education. Among the purposes of foreign language learning are traveling abroad, communication with native speakers, reading foreign literature or scientific and technical works.

There are some major differences between foreign and second language teaching and learning. In second language learning, one can receive input for learning both inside and outside the classroom. He or she can readily put to use what is learned, as can the child learning its first language, so lots of naturalistic practice is possible.

Second language learners are usually more successful in developing non-native language skills and what is learned may be essential for getting along in the community, so motivation is stronger.

[[Acculturation]] that is a main aspect of learning a language is easier in the case of second language learning and the emotional role of language (as opposed to communicational role) is easier to use for learners.

The major characteristics of the planned condition of the classroom in the case of foreign language learning as opposed to natural conditions of second language learning are:

# Psycho-social demands of classroom: The school classroom requires adjustment of the learner to the group processes, classroom discipline and procedures. The learner receives only a limited amount of individual attention. Regular attendance is required.
# Preselected language data: The teacher generally introduces preselected target language items. Spontaneity is limited. A planned curriculum is followed with the teacher attempting to realize certain goals regarding the language that is to be learned.
# Grammatical rules presented. The teacher may describe a rule in the native language to explain a grammatical structure. The teacher is expected to understand, assimilate and later apply the abstract rule.
# Unreal limited situations. Situations for language use in the classroom are limited in variety and scope as compared to those outside of the classroom. The situations which are employed are often simulated.
# Educational aids and assignments. In order to assist learning and achieve teacher goals, books, writing or a language lab, for example, may be used. Work assignments may be given to be completed in the class or at home.

There are some other issues in teaching and learning foreign language and second language including the type of motivation and the distinction between 'learning' and 'acquisition' that I will discuss them in separate parts.

There is often a distinction between acquisition and learning in linguistic and pedagogic literature. Children are described as 'acquiring' their native language, where there is no previous information and knowledge in their mind. On the other hand, adults are said to 'learn' a non-native language. Acquisition is viewed as a natural, unconscious, untaught and probably unteachable process, while learning is somewhat artificial, usually conscious and possibly dependent on instruction and study.

The distinction between acquisition and learning can be used in this discussion, because the general conditions in the case of second language offer opportunities for acquisition, because it is informal, free, undirected or naturalistic. On the other hand, educational treatment in the case of foreign language may offer opportunities mainly for learning.

Nevertheless, acquisition can take place in the case of foreign language learning and learning can take place in the case of second language learning. For example, immigrants to the US can attend language teaching classes in the target language environment. On the other hand, foreign language learners that are far from target language environment can sometimes acquire some points for example by listening to foreign radio, reading literature etc.

'''Forensic software engineering''' refers to the discipline of analyzing (and sometimes reconstructing) the functionality of [[software]] applications or services that have become defunct; are no longer accompanied by, or previously lacked, documentation; or for which the original [[engineer]]s are no longer available.

==Description==
Usually, forensic [[software engineering]] is performed with an interest in understanding the functionality - and sometimes intent - of software that has been abandoned by its creators, with an eye to correcting unexpected outcomes or determining whether to port, rebuild, replace, or retire a functional software instance.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Chris [http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~johnson/papers/Safety_Science/forensic.html "Forensic Software Engineering: Are Software Failures Symptomatic of Systemic Problems?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Is often required as a result of a corporate mergers or acquisitions, or during the migration/transition from an old [[datacenter]] to a newer one.

'''Glass disease''', also referred to as '''sick glass''' or  '''glass illness''', is a degradation process of glass that can result in '''weeping''', '''crizzling''', '''spalling''', cracking and fragmentation.&lt;ref name="Swift"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kunicki-Goldfinger"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kunicki-Goldfinger|first1=Jerzy J.|title=Unstable historic glass: symptoms, causes, mechanisms and conservation|journal=Reviews in Conservation|date=2008|volume=9|pages=47-60 |url=https://www.iiconservation.org/node/2258|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Glass disease is caused by an inherent instability in the chemical composition of the original [[glass]] formula.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt; 
Properties of a particular glass will vary with the type and proportions of [[silica]], [[alkali]] and [[Alkaline earth metal|alkaline earth]] in its composition.&lt;ref name="Hogg"/&gt;
Once damage has occurred it is irreversible, but decay processes can be slowed by climate control to regulate surrounding temperature, humidity, and air flow.

==Chemical composition and decay==
Glass disease is caused by an inherent fault in the chemical composition of the original [[glass]] formula.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt; 
Glass contains three types of components: ''network formers''  establish basic structure, ''network stabilizers'' make glass strong and water resistant, and ''[[Ceramic flux|flux]]'' lowers the melting point at which the glass can be formed.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=   Cansler |first1=Clay  |title=From Ancient to Art Nouveau |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=2 |pages=24-25 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Common formulations of glass may include [[silica]] (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a former, alkali oxides such as [[Sodium oxide|soda]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) or [[potash]] (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) for flux, and alkaline earth oxides such as [[Lime (material)|lime]] (CaO) for stabilizing.&lt;ref name="Hogg"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hogg|first1=Simon|last2=McPhail|first2=David|last3=Oakley|first3=Victoria|last4=Rogers|first4=Philip|title=Cracking Crizzling - Eight Years of Collaborative Research|journal=Conservation Journal|date=1998|issue=29|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-29/cracking-crizzling-eight-years-of-collaborative-research/|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

Structurally, glass is composed of a network of SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-tetrahedrons. In addition to the ''network former'' silicon which establishes its principal structure, glass contains ''network modifying agents'' such as the alkali ions Na+ and K+ and the alkali earth ions Ca&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+ and Mg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;+.  Glass does not have a defined [[stoichiometry]], rather the network is flexible. It can incorporate other ions, depending upon factors such as the main composition and firing conditions of the glass.&lt;ref name="Gradmann"/&gt; This causes almost all glass to be chemically unstable to some extent.&lt;ref name="Oakley"/&gt;

Electron charge differences of ions within the structure form the basis of its bonding. Both viscosity and transition temperature are related to the availability of oxygen bonds in the glass's composition.  Modifying agents tend to lower the melting point of the silica.   Higher contents of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increase [[acidity]] of the glass. Higher contents of CaO, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O increase [[basicity]].&lt;ref name="Gradmann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gradmann|first1=Rena|title=Analysis of historical islamic glazes and the development of a substitution|date=2016 |publisher=Julius Maximilian University of Würzburg|location=w|url=https://d-nb.info/1112041508/34|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The chemical stability of glass decreases when only Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O are added as flux, because bonding becomes weaker. The chemical stability of glass can be increased by adding CaO, MgO, ZnO, and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. To be stable, glass composition must balance temperature lowering agents with stabilizing agents.&lt;ref name="Gradmann"/&gt;

Exposure of a glass surface to moisture, either in solution or from humidity in the atmosphere, causes chemical reactions to occur on and below the surface of the glass. The exchange of alkali metal ions (from within the glass) and hydrogen ions (from outside) can cause chemical and structural changes to the glass. When alkali metal cations in the near-surface layer are replaced by smaller hydrogen ions, structural differences between the affected surface layer and the unaffected lower layers of glass cause increasing tensile stress, which in turn can cause cracking.&lt;ref name="Oakley"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oakley|first1=Victoria|last2=Rogers|first2=Philip |last3=McPhail|first3=David|last4=Amaku|first4=Afi|title=Vessel Glass Deterioration in the Museum Environment: A Quantitative Study by Surface Analysis|journal=Conservation Journal|date=April 1992|issue=3 |url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-03/vessel-glass-deterioration-in-the-museum-environment-a-quantitative-study-by-surface-analysis/|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CW"&gt;{{cite journal|title=20 years ago - Investigating crizzling|journal=Chemistry World (originally appeared in ''Chemistry in Britain'', 1992.)|date=3 October 2012|url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/opinion/20-years-ago-investigating-crizzling/5499.article|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The likelihood of degradation due to glass disease depends on the amount and proportion of alkaline compounds mixed with silica, and on surrounding conditions.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;
Inadequate [[calcium oxide]] causes the alkalis in the glass to remain water-soluble at a low level of humidity. Exposure to higher levels of [[relative humidity]] during storage or display causes alkali to hydrate and leach out of the glass. Repeated changes in humidity can be particularly damaging. It is important to realize that any glass object can deteriorate if it is exposed to unsuitable environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="O'Hern"/&gt; Crystal, historic glass, or treasured family items should never be exposed to the high temperatures and water pressure of a dishwasher.&lt;ref name="Laidman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VAM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Caring for Your Glass|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/c/caring-for-your-glass/|website=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|Energy dispersive x-ray analysis]] (EDXA),&lt;ref name="Swift"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CW"/&gt; [[scanning electron microscopy]] (SEM) and [[secondary ion mass spectrometry]] (SIMS) can be used to study exchange reactions in different types of glass. By quantifying and studying chemical structure and reactions at the near-surface layer, the mechanisms of glass disease can be better understood.&lt;ref name="Oakley"/&gt; 
Measurement of the pH of glass surfaces is particularly important if glass objects have a matte surface, or have been exposed to [[kaolin]] or other substances. In the case of extremely small objects such as glass beads, pH measurement may be necessary to determine whether alkaline salts are present and changes in the glass are occurring.&lt;ref name="O'Hern"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovell"/&gt;

==Stages of deterioration==
The processes involved in glass disease can reduce the transparency of the glass or even threaten the integrity of the structure.  Glass disease causes a complex disintegration of the glass which can be identified through a variety of symptoms, including weeping, crizzling, spalling, cracking and fragmentation.&lt;ref name="Connor"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Connor|first1=Steve|title=Museum tries to stem disease affecting glass: Chemists are being used to combat a disease that is shattering exhibits|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/museum-tries-to-stem-disease-affecting-glass-chemists-are-being-used-to-combat-a-disease-that-is-1556872.html|accessdate=19 April 2018|work=The Independent|date=11 October 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
The following description of glass beads from an object in the collection of the [[British Museum]], effectively illustrates the range of symptoms that can occur with glass disease:  
{{quote|"Two factors indicated that the deterioration was the result of the phenomenon commonly referred to as ‘glass disease’; first, damage was limited to beads of one particular  colour  (pale  yellow)  and  second,  visible  signs  of  all the  various  stages  of  glass  disease  were  present  on  these beads.  This  included  the  presence  of  small  white crystals  on  the  surface  of  most  pale  yellow  beads  and  a fine network of uniform cracks or ‘crizzling’ crossing the surface of 55 of the 69 beads. This crizzling appeared to be more prevalent around the bead holes. A total of 32 beads had areas of spalling, or advanced crizzling, where cracks had  extended  further  into  the  glass  structure... Many had areas that had already spalled and the fragments lost.  Vertical  cracks  extending  through  the  glass  were  present on 37 beads and four beads had become detached due  to  complete  fragmentation."&lt;ref name="Swift"/&gt;}}

===Stage One===
The initial stage of glass disease occurs when moisture causes alkali to be leached out of the glass. This becomes apparent when [[hygroscopic]] alkali deposits on the glass give it a cloudy or hazy appearance.&lt;ref name= "Oakley"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "CMOG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmog.org/article/crizzling |title=Crizzling |author= |date=April 26, 2012 |work= |publisher=Corning Museum of Glass |accessdate=April 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
This may occur within as little as five to 10 years of the glass's manufacturing. 
The glass may feel slippery or slimy&lt;ref name="Laidman"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laidman|first1=Jenni |title=Seeking cures for glass disease |work=The Blade|url=http://www.toledoblade.com/frontpage/2002/05/13/Seeking-cures-for-glass-disease.html|accessdate=20 April 2018|date=May 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
and tiny droplets, or ''weeping'', may be seen in high humidity (above 55%).&lt;ref name= "Koob"/&gt; 
The hydrated alkali can form fine crystals on the surface of the glass in low relative humidity (below 40%).&lt;ref name="Hogg"/&gt;

At this stage, it may be possible to gently wash the glass and remove the surface alkali.&lt;ref name= "Koob"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Koob |first=Stephen |title=Conservation and Care of Glass Objects |publisher=Archetype Publications |location=New York |year=2006 |isbn=1-904982-08-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This will help to stabilize the glass by reducing the surface pH, and by removing dust, soiling, and hygroscopic components that attract further moisture.&lt;ref name="O'Hern"/&gt;

===Stage Two===
If alkali builds up due to ion exchange, and remains on the surface of the glass, the decay process will accelerate. The presence of sodium or potassium ions in the alkali build up will increase the pH on the surface of the glass, causing it to become basic. This will dissolve silica from the glass as well as releasing more alkali ions.&lt;ref name="Laidman"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Oakley" /&gt;

The haziness seen on the glass may not disappear entirely when washed and dried. When examined closely at an angle with a low light, fine cracks like tiny silvery lines or shimmering rays, may be visible.&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt; A microscope can confirm the presence of cracks. The cracks are caused by the loss of alkali, which leaves microscopic gaps in the structure of the glass.&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;

===Stage Three===
As higher amounts of alkali leach from the glass cracks are likely to become deeper. ''Crizzling'' is a distinctive network of fine cracks in the glass which is visible to the naked eye.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brill"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brill|first1=Robert H.|title=Crizzling – a problem in glass conservation|journal=Journal of  Glass Studies|date=1975|volume=20|pages=121–131.|url=https://www.cmog.org/sites/default/files/collections/34/348E74A3-0852-4509-8F50-B4BC45EBD363.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases, the crazing can gain a more uniform appearance.&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt;  However, crizzling may not be uniform due to the creation of micro-climates on the glass.&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;

===Stage Four===
Distinct cracks may appear on the surface of the glass, and surface material may flake or chip, a process referred to as ''spalling.''&lt;ref name="Koob" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "CMOG" /&gt;

===Stage Five===

In the most severe stage of deterioration, the structural integrity of the glass has been lost and the glass may  separate into pieces.&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt;

==Prevalence==
A survey of glass objects at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London, in 1992, found that more than 1 in 10 objects in the collection were affected by crizzling, ranging from 16th century Venetian to 20th century Scandinavian glass.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jordan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jordan|first1=Fi|last2=Oakley|first2=Victoria|title=In pursuit of a clear answer: An Exhibition Road partnership|journal=Conservation Journal|date=2005|issue=50|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-50/in-pursuit-of-a-clear-answer-an-exhibition-road-partnership/|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Venetian glass is particularly susceptible because artisans minimized the use of lime, to make the glass as clear as possible.  
The works of modern glassmakers who experiment with their glass formulas, such as [[Ettore Sottsass]], can also be at high risk for damage.&lt;ref name="Laidman"/&gt;

Museums such as the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] may find glass disease an issue of great importance because many of the Native American cultural materials in their collections incorporate [[glass beads]].&lt;ref name="O'Hern"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Hern|first1=Robin |last2=McHugh |first2=Kelly |title=Red, Blue, and Wound all over: Evaluating Condition Change and Cleaning of  Glass  Disease on Beads|journal=Objects Specialty Group Postprints|date=2014|volume=Twenty-One|pages=205-228 |url=http://resources.conservation-us.org/osg-postprints/wp-content/uploads/sites/8/2015/03/osg021-09.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McHugh"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ohern |first1=Robin |last2=McHugh |first2=Kelly |title=Deterioration and Conservation of Unstable Glass Beads  on Native American Objects|journal=The Bead Forum|date=2013|volume=63 |url=https://beadresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/Repeating_Material/The_Bead_Forum_Archive/The-Bead-Forum-Issue-63-Autumn-2013.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Small ornamental glass beads were often made cheaply, using recipes with a high flux to silica ratio. This makes them more susceptible to glass disease.  Blues, reds, and black are often affected by glass disease. The combination of glass beads with other materials (cordage, fabric, leather, metal, bone, surface colorants, ceremonial substances, and kaolin) complicates deterioration and conservation of ethnographic objects.&lt;ref name="Lovell"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lovell|first1=Adam|title=GLASS BEAD DETERIORATION OF ETHNOGRAPHIC  OBJECTS: IDENTIFICATION, PREVENTION, AND  TREATMENT|date=July 18, 2006|publisher=John F. Kennedy University|location=Pleasant Hill, CA|url=http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Glass_Bead_Deterioration.pdf|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
In the earliest stage of glass disease, it may be possible to wash the glass to remove the surface alkali. The Corning Museum of Glass recommends washing with tap water (tepid, not hot&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;) and a mild (non-ionic&lt;ref name="Newton"/&gt;) conservation detergent. This should be  followed by rinsing with de-ionized or distilled water, and careful drying to remove moisture. Careful washing can remove surface deposits, restore the appearance of clearness to the glass, and help to slow further deterioration.&lt;ref name="Washing"&gt;{{cite web|title=Washing Glass|url=https://blog.cmog.org/2011/12/09/washing-glass/|website=Corning Museum of Glass|date=December 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newton"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Roy|last1=Newton|first2=Sandra|last2=Davison |title=Conservation of glass|date=1996|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|location=Oxford|isbn=0750624485|pages=207-209}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Ethanol]] has also been suggested for cleaning, particularly for glass beads, depending on the surrounding materials that may be affected.&lt;ref name="O'Hern"/&gt;

Once more serious damage has occurred, it cannot be reversed.  Climate control of humidity and temperature is a possible intervention.  Because crizzling results from the reaction of components of the glass with water vapour, controlling humidity and temperature can slow its occurrence.&lt;ref name="Connor"/&gt; At the [[Corning Museum of Glass]], items in the collection are kept at stable levels of relative humidity, between 40 and 55 percent.&lt;ref name="Laidman"/&gt; 
Fans may be used within a case to encourage the movement of air and minimize adsorption of moisture on the glass surface. Deterioration is more likely to occur in areas with restricted air-flow which allow moisture to remain on the glass.&lt;ref name= "Koob" /&gt; Chemical methods for retarding corrosion rates and stabilizing surfaces are being investigated.&lt;ref name="Hogg"/&gt; 

When a composite object contains a variety of materials, one of which is sick glass, the considerations involved in conserving and displaying the object become more complicated. For example, the [[British Museum]] chose to conserve and display a Siberian shamanic apron made of leather, glass and other materials. They weighed the likelihood that it would decay more quickly if shown against the desirability of making a unique object visible and the inevitability of its eventual degradation. "Its conservation and display ensures that access to this beautiful and unique object is maximized before the pale yellow beads, which are intrinsic to the object, are inevitably lost beyond repair."&lt;ref name="Swift"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Swift|first1=Rachel|last2=Meek|first2=Andrew S.|last3=Rode|first3=Nicole|last4=Komlosy|first4=Anouska|title=A radioactive shamanic apron with glass disease|journal=The British Museum Technical Research Bulletin|date=2012|volume=6|pages=25-32|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/BMTRB_6_Swift-et-al.pdf|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''global resources dividend''' (GRD) is a method of tackling [[global poverty]] advanced by the philosopher [[Thomas Pogge]].&lt;ref name=PoggeGRD/&gt; He presents it as an alternative to the current global economic order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pogge|first1=Thomas W.|title=Eradicating Systemic Poverty: Brief for a global resources dividend|journal=Journal of Human Development|date=January 2001|volume=2|issue=1|pages=59–77|doi=10.1080/14649880120050246|url=http://thomaspogge.com/publications-on-global-justice/global-resources-dividend/|accessdate=6 April 2015|issn=1464-9888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the scheme, nations would pay a dividend (tax) on  any resources that they use or sell,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casal|first1=Paula|title=Global Taxes on Natural Resources|journal=Journal of Moral Philosophy|date=1 October 2011|volume=8|issue=3|pages=307–327|url=http://www.icrea.cat/Web/GetFile.asmx/Download?idFile=bIujBBG01Ac%3D|accessdate=6 April 2015|doi=10.1163/174552411X591339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. Widdows, N. Smith (2011) ''Global Social Justice'', Routlege:  New York, p 74&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a sort of "tax on consumption"&lt;ref name = PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; Pogge's scheme is motivated by the positive duty to alleviate poverty, but also on the negative responsibility of the rich not to use institutions that perpetuate [[economic inequality]]. Pogge estimates that a dividend of just 1% could raise $300 billion each year; this would equal $250 for each individual in the worlds poorest quintile.

Implementing some version of the GRD [[logical consequence|entails]] not only discussions about practicality, but presumably, an affirmation of what is right. As Pogge puts it "Our task as philosophers requires that we try to imagine new, better political structures and different, better moral sentiments. We must be realistic, but not to the point of presenting to the parties in the [[original position]] the essentials of the status quo as unalterable facts."&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

==Rights of the disadvantaged==
{{quotebox|quoted=1|source=Thomas Pogge's hypothetical speech to the global poor; he says we should give that speech if we decide that international cooperation is unrealistic, and not worth attempting.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;|align=right|width=40%|quote= We care deeply about equality, and we would very much like it to be the case that you are not so much worse off than we are. But, unfortunately, it is not realistic to expect that we would actually comply with more egalitarian global institutions. Since no one would benefit from a futile attempt to maintain impracticable institutions, we should all just rest content with the global inequalities of the status quo.}}
Pogge's main justification is that, even if the idea of GRD would be refined over time, and would be difficult to implement, it is nevertheless the right of those who are the worst off. The 1% dividend tax is not seen as a donation, but a responsibility.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

Pogge believes that the idea of the GRD may be a natural extension of [[John Rawls]]' [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]], although Rawls himself has express disagreement with this. To Pogge, the world order currently violates the first principle of justice (equal opportunity), as well as the second principle (equal access to offices, but also the idea that inequalities should favour the poorest individuals).&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

Rawls thought that certain individuals may be permitted to various non-liberal views, provided they harmonize with a liberal government. Similarly, Pogge says that we may permit certain nations to operate according to hierarchical, non-liberal systems; but on a global scale, only systems that harmonize with a grander liberal philosophy can be tolerated. Liberals cannot avoid taking sides completely; they must reject [[totalitarianism]], for instance.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; This has implications for the validity of actions that might be taken to promote a GRD.

Under the scheme of a GRD, states do not have full property rights in the resources within their sovereign territory. Although the GRD allows states to use resources as they see fit, the scheme implies that the global poor have an 'inalienable stake in all scarce resources' (see implementation, below).&lt;ref&gt;Haubrich. Dirk (2004) Global Distributive Justice and the Taxation of Natural Resources – Who Should Pick Up the Tab?,''Contemporary Political Theory'', 3: 52&lt;/ref&gt; Pogge argues that national borders are morally arbitrary in the first place, and are born from a history of coercion and violence. He sets these issues aside, however, and focuses on the following claim: any conception of global justice (even if we accept existing national borders as they are) must acknowledge international inequalities.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; Pogge thinks it becomes difficult to justify why a person born to rich parents in Canada should be entitled to so much more than one who is born to poor family in [[Sierra Leone]]. Equally difficult to justify might be the assumption that every person has a right to absolute control over the resources they happen to have within their borders.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

==Implementing a GRD==
Each nation or "peoples" would be given full freedom of what to do with their own resources. They would not be required to extract them, or allow others to extract them. If people decide to use a natural resource, they would pay a dividend. This includes oil, but also the various uses of reusable resources (e.g. polluting water). The dividend results in higher costs for natural resources, and thus amounts to a "tax on consumption".&lt;ref name= PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

The funds garnered from the GRD would be spent by an international organization; a [[world government]] is not ''necessary''. The organization would follow rules established by lawyers, economists, and other professionals from around the world. GRD payments would be used to provide [[basic rights]] to developing nations. Governments who collect the funds and invest them in luxuries for their elite would be completely or partially forbidden from receiving them. In such cases, funding [[NGO]]s may still be an important way of using the GRD to help the poor.&lt;ref name= PoggeEgalitarian/&gt;

[[File:Gini Coefficient World CIA Report 2009-1.png|thumb|right|350px|There are different inequalities between, but also (pictured above) within countries. As the system around the GRD becomes more sophisticated, it could accommodate such issues.]]
The lowest level of the dividend (1%) is still likely to have a big impact on international development goals&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; (e.g. the [[Millennium Development Goals]]). Supporters of the Global Resources Dividend argue that it would also have an environmental benefit by reducing demand for non-renewable energy sources.&lt;ref name=PoggeGRD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Risse|first1=Mathias|title=What We Owe to the Global Poor: Political Philosophy Meets Development Economics|date=1 August 2003|publisher=Harvard University|pages=52|url=https://research.hks.harvard.edu/publications/workingpapers/citation.aspx?PubId=1599|accessdate=6 April 2015|ref=risse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pogge imagines that there may be dissent between and within nations. Again, he does not think a world government is necessary. Those countries that fail to pay their required GRD could be taxed by all the other countries doing trade with it. If a majority of countries are paying their GRD, these taxes would help deter dissenters.&lt;ref name=PoggeEgalitarian/&gt; The idea is that there would be added pressure on each country to enforce the gathering of GRD funds within its borders.

Primary products or 'raw materials' are often refined into more expensive secondary products. As such it can be argued that the GRD is applied too early in the manufacturing process and does not take account of the environmental costs of manufacturing products beyond the extraction of raw materials. As the GRD evolves over time, this could be one of many improvements.

== Criticism ==
Richard Reichel states that it is unlikely that a Global resources dividend will work. He argues that increased financial flows could hurt an under developed economy and that an internal distribution with GRD is not resolved.&lt;ref name=Reichel&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reichel|first1=Richard|title=Internationaler Handel, Tauschgerechtigkeit und die globale Rohstoffdividende|journal=Analyse und Kritik|date=1997|volume=19|issue=3|pages=229–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tim Hayward argues multiple reasons against the Global resources dividend. For one he uses [[Joseph Heath]]'s argument that the distributive effects could harm the poor nations that are not resource rich. Hayward states that because Pogge does not include the cultivation of basic commodities because poor people would be under economic pressure to produce cash crops instead of food crops.&lt;ref name=Hayward&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hayward|first1=Tim|title=Thomas Pogge’s Global Resources Dividend: A Critique and an Alternative|journal=Journal of Moral Philosophy|date=1 November 2005|volume=2|issue=3|pages=317–332|doi=10.1177/1740468105058157|url=https://www.academia.edu/7038440/Thomas_Pogges_Global_Resources_Dividend_a_critique_and_an_alternative|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Just Gjessing''' (Oslo, 13 July 1926 – 29 October 2005) was a Norwegian geographer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://snl.no/Just_Gjessing Just Gjessing], [[Store Norske Leksikon]]&lt;/ref&gt; Gjessing obtained a Ph.D. degree in 1960 with a study on Norway’s [[hydrology]] during [[deglaciation]]. One year later he was appointed full professor. In the late 1960s Gjessing became increasingly interested in nature conservation so that in the 1970s shifted the focus of his research into [[environmental impact assessment]]s. This meant leaving behind his work on pure [[fluvial geomorphology]] that had previously brought him acclaim. Following this interest he joined in 1967 the Oslo University’s Commission for Watercourse Regulation. In 1971 he became chairman of the commission while also entering the Joint Commission for Hydroelectric Power Development and Nature Conservation, of which he was a member until 1981. He co-authored various notable books including ''Beste Store Norge Atlas'' (1983) and the five volume work ''Norge'' (1984–1986) and the journal ''[[Norsk Geografisk Tidsskrift]]'' from 1979 to 1987. In the 1980s the work of Gjessing turned increasingly international with many travels to [[West Africa|West]] and [[North Africa]] where he studied environmental issues in arid and semi-arid landscapes.&lt;ref name=Trondalen200en&gt;{{cite journal|author-last=Trondalen|author-first=Jon Martin |date=2006|title=Professor Just Gjessing: ‘A journey with a purpouse’ |journal=[[Norwegian Journal of Geography]] |volume=60|issue=|pages=161–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gjessing’s personality and approach made him subject of strong and lasting criticism from so-called “rejectionist” even within his own department at the [[University of Oslo]]. Despite their opposition Gjessing managed to establish the course Resource Geography and Landscape Ecology in 1985, attending student demands that had emerged in the 1970s about the need of courses on natural resources and environmental management.&lt;ref name=Trondalen200en/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="44941">This is an outline of [[exegesis|commentaries and commentators]]. Discussed are the salient points of Jewish, patristic, medieval, and modern commentaries on the Bible. The article includes discussion of the [[Targums]], [[Mishna]], and [[Talmuds]], which are not regarded as Bible commentaries in the modern sense of the word, but which provide the foundation for later commentary. With the exception of these classical Jewish works, this article focuses on Christian Biblical commentaries; for more on Jewish Biblical commentaries, see [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible]].

==Jewish commentaries==
{{Main|Jewish commentaries on the Bible}}

===Philo===
A visitor to Alexandria at the time when [[Christ]] was preaching in [[Galilee]] would find there and in its vicinity Jews using the [[Septuagint]] as their Bible, and could enter their Great Synagogue. Whoever had not seen it was not supposed to have beheld the glory of [[Israel]]. The members of their [[Sanhedrin]], according to Sukkah, were seated on seventy-one golden thrones valued at tens of thousands of talents of gold; and the building was so vast that a flag had to be waved to show the people when to respond. At the head of this assembly, on the highest throne, was seated [[Alexander the Alabarch]], the brother of Philo.

Philo himself was a man of wealth and learning, who mingled with all classes of men and frequented the theatre and the great library. Equally at home in the Septuagint and the Greek classics, he was struck and perplexed by the many beautiful and noble thoughts contained in the latter, which could bear comparison with many passages of the Bible. As this difficulty must have frequently presented itself to the minds of his coreligionists, he endeavoured to meet it by saying that all that was great in Socrates, [[Plato]], etc. originated with Moses. He set about reconciling [[Pagan]] philosophy with the [[Old Testament]], and for this purpose he made extensive use of the allegorical method of interpretation. He taught that many passages of the Pentateuch were not intended to be taken literally. In fact, he said that they were literally false, but allegorically true.

He did not make the distinction between natural and revealed religion. For example, Pagan systems may have natural religion highly developed, but, from a Judeo-Christian point of view, with much concomitant error. His exegesis served to tide over the difficulty for the time amongst the Hellenistic Jews, and had great influence on [[Origen of Alexandria]] and other Alexandrian Christian writers.

===The Targums===

Farrar, in his "Life of Christ", says that it has been suggested that when Christ visited the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]], at twelve years of age, there may have been present among the doctors [[Jonathan ben Uzziel]], once thought the author of the [[Targum Jonathan|Yonathan Targum]], and the venerable teachers [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] and [[Shammai]], the handers-on of the [[Mishna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04157a.htm|title=Commentaries on the Bible}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Targums (the most famous of which is that on the Pentateuch erroneously attributed to Onkelos, a misnomer for [[Aquila of Sinope|Aquila]], according to Abrahams) were the only approach to anything like a commentary on the Bible before the time of Christ. They were interpretative translations or paraphrases from [[Hebrew]] into [[Aramaic]] for the use of the synagogues when, after the [[Babylonian Captivity|Exile]], the people had lost the knowledge of Hebrew. It is doubtful whether any of them were committed to writing before the Christian Era. They are important as indicating the character of the Hebrew text used.

[[Rashi|Shlomo Yitzchaki]] (1040-1105), more commonly known as Rashi ('''RA'''bbi '''SH'''lomo '''I'''tzhaki), was a [[France in the Middle Ages|medieval French]] [[rabbi]] and author of a comprehensive commentary on the [[Talmud]] and [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible|commentary on the ''Tanakh'']].

===The Mishna and Talmuds===

Hillel and Shammai were the last "pair" of several generations of "pairs" ([[Zugot]]) of teachers. These pairs were the successors of the early scribes who lived after the Exile. These teachers are said to have handed down and expanded the [[Oral Torah|Oral Law]], which, according to the uncritical view of many Jews, began with Moses. This Oral Law consists of legal and liturgical interpretations and applications of the Pentateuch. As no part of it was written down, it was preserved by constant repetition (Mishna). On the destruction of Jerusalem several rabbis, learned in this Law, settled at [[Council of Jamnia|Jamnia]], near the sea, twenty-eight miles west of Jerusalem. Jamnia became the headquarters of [[Council of Jamnia|Jewish learning until AD 135]], due to the [[Third Jewish Revolt]]. Then schools were opened at [[Sepphoris]] and [[Tiberias]] to the west of the [[Sea of Galilee]]. The rabbis comforted their countrymen by teaching that the study of the Law (Oral as well as Written) took the place of the sacrifices. They devoted their energies to arranging the Unwritten Torah, or Law. One of the most successful at this was [[Rabbi Akiva|Rabbi Akiba]] who took part in the Third Jewish Revolt of [[Simon Bar-Kochba|Bar Kochba]], against the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], and lost his life (135). The work of systematization was completed and probably committed to writing by the Jewish patriarch at [[Tiberias]], Rabbi [[Judah haNasi|Jehudah ha-Nasi]] "The Prince" (150-210). He was of noble birth, wealthy, learned, and is called by the Jews "Our Master the Saint" or simply Rabbi par excellence. The compilation made by this Rabbi is the [[Mishna]]. It is written in [[Hebrew Language|Mishnaic Hebrew]], and consists of six great divisions or orders, each division containing, on an average, about ten tractates, each tractate being made up of several chapters. The Mishna may be said to be a compilation of Jewish traditional moral theology, liturgy, law, etc. There were other traditions not embodied in the work of Rabbi, and these are called additional Mishna.

The discussions of later generations of rabbis all centred round the text of the Mishna. Interpreters or "speakers" laboured upon it both in [[Jerusalem]] and [[Babylonia]] (until 500), and the results are comprised in the [[Jerusalem Talmud|Jerusalem]] and Babylonian [[Talmud]]s. The word Talmud means teaching, doctrine. Each Talmud consists of two parts, the Mishna (in Hebrew), in sixty-three tractates, and an explanation of the same ([[Gemara]]), ten or twelve times as long. The explanatory portion of the Jerusalem Talmud is written in [[Western Neo-Aramaic|NeoWestern Aramaic]] and that of the Babylonian Talmud in Eastern [[Aramaic]], which is closely allied to [[Syriac language|Syriac]] or [[Mandaic language|Mandaic]]. The passages in the Gemara containing additional Mishna are, however, given in New Hebrew. Only thirty-nine tractates of the Mishna have Gemara. The Talmud, then, consists of the Mishna (traditions from 450 BC till 200 AD), together with a commentary thereon, Gemara, the latter being composed about 200-500 AD. Next to the Bible the Babylonian Talmud is the great religious book of orthodox Jews, though the Palestinian Talmud is more highly prized by modern scholars. From the year 500 till the Middle Ages the rabbis (geonim) in Babylonia and elsewhere were engaged in commenting on the Talmud and reconciling it with the Bible. A list of such commentaries is given in ''The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''.

===The Midrashim===

Simultaneously with the Mishna and Talmud there grew up a number of [[Midrashim]], or commentaries on the Bible. some of these were legalistic, like the [[halakhic]] sections of the Talmud but the most important were of an edifying, [[homiletics|homiletic]] character ([[Midrash Aggadah]]). These latter, although chronologically later, are important for the corroborative light which they throw on the language of the New Testament. The [[Gospel of St. John]] is seen to be steeped in early Jewish phraseology, and the words of Ps. cix [[Hebrew Bible]] 110], "The Lord said to my Lord", etc. are in one place{{Where|date=July 2011}} applied to the [[Messiah]], as they are in [[Gospel of St. Matthew 22:44]] (referenced from Psalm 110:1), though [[Rashi]] following the Rabbis interpreted the words in the sense of applying them to [[Abraham]].

===Karaite commentators===

[[Anan ben David]], a prominent Babylonian Jew in the eighth century, rejected Rabbinism for the written Old Testament and became the founder of the sect known a [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]] (a word indicating their preference for the written Bible). This schism produced great energy and ability on both sides. The principal Karaite Bible commentators were [[Nahavendi]] (ninth century); [[Abu al-Faraj Harun]] (ninth century), exegete and Hebrew grammarian; [[Solomon ben Yerucham]] (tenth century); [[Sahal ben Mazliach]] (died 950), Hebrew grammarian and lexicographer; [[Joseph al-Bazir]] (died 930); [[Yefet ben Ali|Japhet ben Ali]], the greatest Karaite commentator of the tenth century; and [[Judah Hadassi]] (died 1160).

===Middle Ages===

[[Saadia Gaon|Saadiah of Fayûm]] (died 892), the most powerful writer against the Karaites, translated the Bible into Arabic and added notes. Besides commentaries on the Bible, Saadiah wrote a systematic treatise bringing revealed religion into harmony with Greek philosophy. He thus became the forerunner of Maimonides and the Catholic Schoolmen.

[[Solomon ben Isaac]], called Rashi (born 1040) wrote very popular explanations of the Talmud and the Bible.

[[Tobiah ben Eliezer]] a [[Romaniote Jews|Romaniote]] scholar and [[paytan]] in 11th century [[Kastoria]] ([[Greece]]), wrote the ''Leḳaḥ Ṭov'' or ''Pesiḳta Zuṭarta'', a [[midrash]]ic commentary on the [[Pentateuch]] and the Five [[Megillot]].

[[Abraham Ibn Ezra]] of Toledo (died 1168) had a good knowledge of Oriental languages and wrote learned commentaries on the Old Testament. He was the first to maintain that Isaiah contains the work of two prophets.

[[Moses Maimonides]] (died 1204), the greatest Jewish scholar of the Middle Ages, of whom his coreligionists said that "from Moses to Moses there was none like Moses", wrote his "Guide to the Perplexed", which was read by [[Thomas Aquinas|St. Thomas]]. He was a great admirer of Aristotle, who was to him the representative of natural knowledge as the Bible was of the supernatural.

There were the two Kimchis, especially David (died 1235) of Narbonne, who was a celebrated grammarian, lexicographer, and commentator inclined to the literal sense. He was followed by Nachmanides of Catalonia (died 1270), a doctor of medicine who wrote commentaries of a cabbalistic tendency; Immanuel of Rome (born 1270); and the Karaites [[Aaron ben Joseph of Constantinople|Aaron ben Joseph]] (1294), and [[Aaron ben Elias]] (fourteenth century).

===Modern===

[[Isaac Abarbanel]] (born [[Lisbon]], 1437; died [[Venice]], 1508) was a statesman and scholar. None of his predecessors came so near the modern ideal of a commentator as he did. He prefixed general introductions to each book, and was the first Jew to make extensive use of Christian commentaries. [[Elias Levita]] (died 1549) and [[Azariah dei Rossi|Azarias de Rossi]] (died 1577) have also to be mentioned.

[[Moses Mendelssohn]] of Berlin (died 1786), a friend of [[Lessing]], translated the Pentateuch into German. His commentaries (in Hebrew) are close, learned, critical, and acute. He had much influence, and was followed by [[Wessely]], [[Jarosław]], [[Herz Homberg|Homberg]], [[Euchel]], [[David Friedländer|Friedlander]], [[Hertz]], [[Herxheimer]], [[Ludwig Philippson]], etc., called "[[Biurists]]", or expositors. The modern liberal school among the Jews is represented by [[Salomon Munk]], [[Samuel David Luzzato]], [[Leopold Zunz]], Geiger, [[Julius Fürst]], etc.

[[Pesach Wolicki|Rabbi Pesach Wolicki]] (born 1970) is a biblical scholar and commentator. His book, ''Cup of Salvation'', also known as ''Cup of Salvation: A Powerful Journey Through King David's Psalms of Praise'', which was published by the [[Center for Jewish–Christian Understanding and Cooperation]] (CJCUC) in 2017, is a devotional biblical commentary on [[Psalms]] 113-118 otherwise known as the [[Hallel]].

==Patristic commentaries==
The history of [[Biblical hermeneutics|Christian exegesis]] may be roughly divided into three periods: the Age of the Fathers, the Age of Catenæ and Scholia (seventh to sixteenth century), and the Age of Modern Commentaries (sixteenth to twentieth century). The earliest known commentary on Christian scriptures was by a [[Gnostic]] named [[Heracleon]] in {{CE|the 170s}}. Most of the patristic commentaries are in the form of homilies, or discourses to the faithful, and range over the whole of Scripture. There are two schools of interpretation, that of Alexandria and that of Antioch.

===Alexandrian School===

The chief writers of the [[Alexandrian School]] were:
* [[Pantænus]],
* [[Clement of Alexandria]],
* [[Origen of Alexandria]],
* [[Dionysius of Alexandria]],
* [[Didymus the Blind|Didymus]] the blind priest,
* [[Cyril of Alexandria]], and
* [[Pierius|St. Pierius]].
To these may be added
* [[St. Ambrose]], who, in a moderate degree, adopted their system.

Its chief characteristic was the allegorical method. This was, doubtless, founded on passages in the [[Synoptic Gospels|Gospels]] and the [[Epistles of St. Paul]], but it received a strong impulse from the writings of Alexandrian Jews, especially of Philo.

The great representative of this school was Origen (died 254). Origen was the son of [[Leonides of Alexandria]], himself a saint and martyr. Origen became the master of many great saints and scholars, one of the most celebrated being [[St. Gregory Thaumaturgus]]; he was known as the "[[Wiktionary:Adamantine|Adamantine]]" on account of his incessant application to study, writing, lecturing, and works of piety. He frequently kept seven amanuenses actively employed; it was said he became the author of 6000 works ([[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], Hær., lxiv, 63); according to [[St. Jerome]], who reduced the number to 2000 (Contra. Rufin., ii, 22), he left more writings than any man could read in a lifetime (Ep. xxxiii, ad Paulam). Besides his great labours on the [[Hexapla]] he wrote scholia, homilies, and commentaries on the Old and the New Testament. In his scholia he gave short explanations of difficult passages after the manner of his contemporaries, the annotators of the Greek classics. Most of the scholia, in which he chiefly sought the literal sense, are unfortunately lost, but it is supposed that their substance is embodied in the writings of [[St. John Chrysostom]] and other Fathers. In his other works Origen pushed the allegorical interpretation to the utmost extreme. In spite of this, however, his writings were of great value, and with the exception of St. Augustine, no writer of ancient times had such influence.

===Antiochene School===
{{main|School of Antioch}}

The writers of the Antiochene School disliked the allegorical method, and sought almost exclusively the literal, primary, or historical sense of Holy Scripture. The principal writers of this school were
* [[Lucian of Antioch|St. Lucian]],
* [[Eusebius of Nicomedia]],
* [[Maris of Chalcedon]],
* [[Eudoxius of Antioch|Eudoxius]],
* [[Theognis of Nicaea]],
* Asterius,
* [[Arius]] the heresiarch,
* [[Diodorus of Tarsus|Diodorus]] of Antioch, [[Bishop of Tarsus]], and his three great pupils,
* [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]],
* Theodore's brother [[Polychronius]], and
* St. [[John Chrysostom]]. With these may be counted

The great representatives of this school were Diodorus, Theodore of Mopsuestia, and St. John Chrysostom. Diodorus, who died Bishop of Tarsus (394), followed the literal to the exclusion of the mystical or allegorical sense. Theodore was born at Antioch, in 347, became Bishop of Mopsuestia, and died in the communion of the Church, 429. He was a powerful thinker, but an obscure and prolix writer. He felt intense dislike for the mystical sense, and explained the Scriptures in an extremely literal and almost rationalistic manner.

His pupil, [[Nestorius]], became the subject of the Nestorian controversy; the [[Nestorianism|Nestorians]] translated his books into [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and regarded Theodore as their great "Doctor". This made Catholics suspicious of his writings, which were finally condemned after the famous controversy on [[Three Chapter Controversy|The Three Chapters]]. Theodore's commentary on [[Gospel of John|St. John's Gospel]], in Syriac, was published, with a Latin translation, by a Catholic scholar, Dr. Chabot.

St. John Chrysostom, priest of Antioch, became Patriarch of [[Constantinople]] in 398. He left homilies on most of the books of the Old and the New Testament.  When St. Thomas Aquinas was asked by one of his brethren whether he would not like to be the owner of [[Paris, France|Paris]], so that he could dispose of it to the [[King of France]] and with the proceeds promote the good works of his order, he answered that he would prefer to be the possessor of Chrysostom's ''Super Matthæum''. [[Isidore of Pelusium|St. Isidore of Pelusium]] said of him that if the Apostle St. Paul could have used [[Attic Greek|Attic speech]] he would have explained his own Epistles in the identical words of St. John Chrysostom.

===Intermediate School===

Other writers combined both these systems, some leaning more to the allegorical and some to the literal sense. The principal contributors were
* [[Isidore of Pelusium]],
* [[Theodoret]],
* [[St. Basil]],
* [[St. Gregory of Nazianzus]],
* [[St. Gregory of Nyssa]],
* [[St. Hilary of Poitiers]],
* [[Ambrosiaster]],
* St. [[Jerome]],
* St. [[Augustine]],
* [[St. Gregory the Great]], and
* [[Pelagius]].

Jerome, besides his translations of Scripture and other works, left many commentaries, in some of which he departed from the literal meaning of the text. At times he did not always indicate when he was quoting from different authors, which according to [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]] accounts for his apparent discrepancies.

==Medieval commentaries==
The medieval writers were content to draw from the rich treasures left them by their predecessors. Their commentaries consisted, for the most part, of passages from the Church Fathers, which they connected together as in a chain, a ''[[catena (Biblical commentary)|catena]]''.

===Greek Catenists===

* [[Procopius of Gaza]] (sixth century) was one of the first to write a catena. He was followed by
* [[St. Maximus, Martyr]] (seventh),
* [[St. John Damascene]] (eighth),
* Olympiodorus (tenth),
* [[Oecumenius|Ecumenius]] (tenth),
* [[Nicetas of Constantinople]] (eleventh),
* [[Theophylact of Ohrid|Blessed Theophylactus]], Archbishop in Bulgaria (eleventh),
* [[Euthymius Zigabenus]] (twelfth), and the
* writers of anonymous catenæ edited by [[John Antony Cramer]] and [[Cardinal Mai]].

===Latin Catenists, Scholiasts, etc.===

The principal Latin commentators of this period were the Venerable Bede, Walafrid Strabo, Anselm of Laon, Hugh of Saint-Cher, St. Thomas Aquinas, and Nicholas de Lyra.

The [[Venerable Bede]] (seventh to eighth century), a good Greek and Hebrew scholar, wrote a useful commentary on most of the books of the Old and the New Testament. It is in reality a catena of passages from Greek and Latin Fathers judiciously selected and digested.

[[Walafrid Strabo]] (ninth century), a Benedictine, was credited with the "[[Glossa Ordinaria]]" on the entire Bible. It is a brief explanation of the literal and mystical sense, based on Rabanus Maurus and other Latin writers, and was one of the most popular works during the Middle Ages, being as well known as "The Sentences" of Peter Lombard.

[[Anselm of Laon]], professor at Paris (twelfth century), wrote the ''[[Glossa Interlinearis]]'', so called because the explanation was inserted between the lines of the Vulgate.

[[Hugh of Saint-Cher]] (Hugo de Sancto Caro), thirteenth century), besides his pioneer [[Biblical concordance]], composed a short commentary on the whole of the Scriptures, explaining the literal, allegorical, analogical, and moral sense of the text. His work was called ''Postillæ'', i. e. ''post illa'' (''verba textus''), because the explanation followed the words of the text.

[[Thomas Aquinas]] (thirteenth century) left commentaries on Job, Psalms, Isaiah, Epistles of St. Paul, and was the author of the well-known ''Catena Aurea'' on the Gospels. This consists of quotations from over eighty [[Church Fathers]]. He throws much light on the literal sense and is most happy in illustrating difficult points by parallel passages from other parts of the Bible.

[[Nicholas de Lyra]] (thirteenth century), joined the [[Franciscans]] in 1291 and brought to the service of the Church knowledge of Hebrew and rabbinical learning. He wrote short notes or ''Postillæ'' on the entire Bible, and set forth the literal meaning with great ability, especially of the books written in Hebrew. This work was most popular, and in frequent use during the late Middle Ages, and [[Martin Luther]] was indebted to it.

A great impulse was given to exegetical studies by the [[Council of Vienne]] which decreed, in 1311, that chairs of Hebrew, Chaldean, and Arabic should be established at Paris, Oxford, Bologna, and Salamanca.

Besides the major writers already mentioned the following are some of the principal exegetes, many of them Benedictines, from patristic times till the Council of Trent:

* [[Cassiodorus]] (sixth century);
* [[Isidore of Seville|Saint Isidore of Seville]] (seventh);
* [[Julian of Toledo]] (seventh);
* [[Alcuin]] (eighth);
* [[Rabanus Maurus]] (ninth);
* [[Druthmar]] (ninth);
* [[Remigius of Auxerre]] (ninth);
* [[Bruno of Würzburg]], a distinguished Greek and Hebrew scholar;
* [[Bruno of Cologne|St. Bruno]], founder of the Carthusians (eleventh);
* [[Gilbert of Poitiers]];
* [[Andrew of Saint Victor]] (twelfth);
* [[Rupert of Deutz]] (twelfth);
* [[Alexander of Hales]] (thirteenth);
* [[Albertus Magnus]] (thirteenth);
* [[Paul of Burgos]] (fourteenth to fifteenth);
* [[Alphonsus Tostatus]] of Avila (fifteenth);
* [[Ludolph of Saxony]]; and [[Dionysius the Carthusian]], who wrote a commentary on the whole of the Bible;
* [[Jacobus Faber Stapulensis]] (fifteenth to sixteenth);
* [[Gagnaeus]] (fifteenth to sixteenth).
* [[Erasmus]] and [[Cardinal Cajetan]] (sixteenth).

==Modern Catholic commentaries==

The influx of Greek scholars into Italy after the fall of Constantinople, the Christian and anti-Christian Renaissance, the invention of printing, the controversial excitement caused by the rise of Protestantism, and the publication of polyglot Bibles by Cardinal Ximenes and others, gave renewed interest in the study of the Bible among Catholic scholars. Controversy showed them the necessity of devoting more attention to the literal meaning of the text, according to the wise principle laid down by St. Thomas in the beginning of his "Summa Theologica".

It was then that the Jesuits, founded in 1534, stepped into the front rank to counter the attacks on the Catholic Church. The Ratio Studiorum of the Jesuits made it incumbent on their professors of Scripture to acquire a mastery of Greek, Hebrew, and other Oriental languages. [[Alfonso Salmeron]], one of the first companions of [[Ignatius Loyola]], and the pope's theologian at the Council of Trent, was a distinguished Hebrew scholar and voluminous commentator. [[Robert Bellarmine|Bellarmine]], one of the first Christians to write a Hebrew grammar, composed a valuable commentary on the [[Psalms]], giving an exposition of the Hebrew, Septuagint, and Vulgate texts. It was published as part of [[Cornelius a Lapide]]'s commentary on the whole Bible. Cornelius a Lapide, S. J. (born 1566), was a native of the Low Countries, and was well versed in Greek and Hebrew. During forty years he devoted himself to teaching and to the composition of his great work, which has been highly praised by Protestants as well as Catholics.

[[Juan Maldonato]], a Spanish Jesuit, born 1584, wrote commentaries on Isaias, Baruch, Ezechiel, Daniel, Psalms, Proverbs, Canticles (Song of Solomon), and Ecclesiastes. His best work, however, is his Latin commentary on the Four Gospels, which is generally acknowledged to be one of the best ever written. When Maldonato was teaching at the University of Paris the hall was filled with eager students before the lecture began, and he had frequently to speak in the open air.

Great as was the merit of the work of Maldonato, it was equalled by the commentary on the Epistles by [[Estius]] (born at Gorcum, Holland, 1542), a secular priest, and superior of the College at Douai. These two works are still of the greatest help to the student.

Many other Jesuits were the authors of valuable exegetical works, e.g.:
* [[Francis Ribera of Castile]] (born 1514);
* [[Francisco de Toledo (Cardinal)|Cardinal Toletus]] of Cordova (born 1532);
* [[Manuel de Sá]] (died 1596);
* [[Bonfrère of Dinant]] (born 1573);
* [[Mariana of Talavera]] (born 1537);
* [[Luis del Alcázar|Alcazar of Seville]] (born 1554);
* [[Barradius]] "the Apostle of Portugal";
* [[Sánchez of Alcalá]] (died 1628);
* [[Nicholas Serarius]] of Lorraine (died 1609);
* [[Lorinus of Avignon]] (born 1559);
* [[Tirinus of Antwerp]] (born 1580);
* [[Menochius of Pavia]];
* [[Pereira of Valencia]] (died 1610); and
* [[Pineda of Seville]].

The Jesuits were rivalled by
* [[Arias Montanus]] (died 1598), the editor of the Antwerp Polyglot Bible;
* [[Sixtus of Siena]], O. P. (died 1569);
* [[Johann Wild]] (Ferus), O. S. F.;
* [[Dominic Soto]], O. P. (died 1560);
* [[Andreas Masius]] (died 1573);
* [[Jansen of Ghent]] (died 1576);
* [[Génébrard of Cluny]] (died 1597);
* [[Antonio Agelli]] (died 1608);
* [[Luke of Bruges]] (died 1619);
* [[Calasius]], O. S. F. (died 1620);
* [[Malvenda]], O. P. (died 1628);
* [[Jansen of Ypres]]
* [[Simeon de Muis]] (died 1644);
* [[Jean Morin (theologian)|Jean Morin]], Oratorian (died 1659);
* [[Isaac Le Maistre]] (de Sacy);
* [[John Sylveira]], Carmelite (died 1687);
* [[Jacques-Bénigne Bossuet|Bossuet]] (died 1704);
* [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]], Oratorian (died 1712);
* [[Calmet]], Benedictine, who wrote a valuable dictionary of the Bible, of which there is an English translation, and a highly esteemed commentary on all the books of Scripture (died 1757);
* [[Louis de Carrières]], Oratorian (died 1717);
* [[Piconio]], Capuchin (died 1709);
* [[Bernard Lamy (mathematician)|Bernard Lamy]], Oratorian (died 1715);
* [[Pierre Guarin]], O. S. B. (died 1729);
* [[Charles François Houbigant|Houbigant]], Oratorian (died 1783);
* [[William Smits]], Recollect (1770);
* [[Jacques Le Long]], Oratorian (died 1721);
* [[Dominikus von Brentano]] (died 1797).

==Modern Orthodox commentaries==
*The Explanatory Bible of [[Aleksandr Lopukhin]] and successors (1904-1913) is written by professors of Russian theological seminaries and academies. It's based on Russian Synodal Translation, its authors apply to ancient sources of the text ([[Masoretic Text]], [[Septuagint]], etc.). At the present time, is the only full Russian Orthodox Bible commentary on both canonical and deuterocanonical books of the Scripture. The Lopukhin Bible was republished in 1987 by Biblical Societies of Northern Europe countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ekzeget.ru/tolk_info.php?tolk=%D2%EE%EB%EA%EE%E2%E0%FF%20%C1%E8%E1%EB%E8%FF%20%C0.%CF.%20%CB%EE%EF%F3%F5%E8%ED%E0|title=Толковая Библия А.П.

*The [[Orthodox Study Bible]] is an English-language translation and annotation of the [[Septuagint]] with references to the [[Masoretic Text]] in its Old Testament part and its New Testament part it represents the [[NKJV]], which uses the [[Textus Receptus]], representing 94% of Greek manuscripts. It offers commentary and other material to show the Eastern Orthodox Christian understanding of Scripture often in opposite to catholic and Protestant ideas. Additionally the OSB provides basic daily prayers, a lectionary for personal use, and reproductions of icons in its pages.&lt;ref&gt;The Comprehensive New Testament'' notes that this is an accurate translation of the Koine (Received or Ecclesiastical) Text, instead of the modern "reasoned eclectic" Alexandrian text base in Nestle-Aland/UBS (based on three ancient manuscripts representative of a small part of Christian tradition, ''[[Codex Sinaiticus|Codices Sinaiticus]], [[Codex Vaticanus|Vaticanus]], and [[Codex Alexandrinus|Alexandrinus]]. and {{cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/phronema/review_osb.aspx|title=Book Review: The Orthodox Study Bible|author=Archimandrite Ephrem|publisher=Orthodox Christian Information Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opinions of the English rationalists were disseminated on the Continent by [[Voltaire]] and others. In Germany the ground was prepared by the philosophy of [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)#Philosophy|Wolff]] and the writings of his disciple [[Johann Salomo Semler|Semler]]. The posthumous writings of [[Hermann Samuel Reimarus|Reimarus]] were published by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]] between 1774-78 (''The Fragments of Wolfenbüttel''). Lessing pretended that the author was unknown. According to the "Fragments", Moses, Christ, and the Apostles were impostors. Lessing was vigorously attacked, especially by Goeze. [[Johann Gottfried Eichhorn|Eichhorn]], in his "Introduction to the Old Testament" (Leipzig 1780-83, 3 vols.), maintained that the Scriptures were genuine productions, but that, as the Jews saw the intervention of God in the most ordinary natural occurrences, the miracles should be explained naturally.

[[Heinrich Paulus]] (1761–1850), following the lead of Eichhorn, applied to the Gospels the naturalistic method of explaining miracles. G. L Bauer, Heyne (died 1812), and Creuzer denied the authenticity of the greater portion of the Pentateuch and compared it to the mythology of the Greeks and Romans. The greatest advocate of such views was [[Wilhelm Martin Leberecht de Wette|de Wette]] (1780–1849), a pupil of Paulus. In his "Introduction to the Old Testament" (1806) he maintained that the miraculous narratives of the Old Testament were popular legends, which in the course of centuries, became transformed and transfused with the marvellous and the supernatural, and were finally committed to writing in perfectly good faith.

[[David Strauss]] (1808–74) applied this mythical explanation to the Gospels.&lt;ref name=Strauss&gt;{{cite book | author = David Strauss  |title = The Life of Jesus Critically Examined (translated into English by Marian Evans 1860 | publisher = Calvin Blanchard | year = 1835}}&lt;/ref&gt; He showed most clearly, that if with Paulus the Gospels are allowed to be authentic, the attempt to explain the miracles naturally breaks down completely. Strauss rejected the authenticity and regarded the miraculous accounts in the Gospels as naive legends, the productions of the pious imaginations of the early generations of Christians.

The views of Strauss were severely criticized by the Catholics, Kuhn, Mack, Hug, and Sepp, and by the Protestants Neander, Tholuck, Ullman, Lange, Ewald, Riggenbach, Weiss, and Keim.

Baur originated a theory which was for a time in great vogue, but which was afterwards abandoned by the majority of critics. He held that the New Testament contains the writings of two antagonistic parties amongst the Apostles and early Christians. His principal followers were [[Eduard Zeller|Zeller]], [[Albert Schwegler|Schwegler]], [[Gottlieb Jakob Planck|Planck]], [[Köslin (theologian)|Köslin]], [[Ritsch]], [[Adolf Bernhard Christoph Hilgenfeld|Hilgenfeld]], Volkmar, Tobler, [[Karl Theodor Keim|Keim]], [[Hosten (theologian)|Hosten]], some of whom, however, emancipated themselves from their master.

Besides the writers already mentioned, the following wrote in a rationalistic spirit:
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}

* Berthold (1822),
* the Rosenmüllers,

* Wellhausen,
* Wieseler,
* Jülicher,
* Beyschlag,
* [[H. Holtzmann]], and his collaborators
* Schmiedel, von Soden
{{col-end}}

Holtzmann, while practically admitting the authenticity of the Gospels, especially of St. Mark, explains away the miracles. He believes that miracles do not happen, and that the scripture are merely echoes of Old Testament miracle stories.  Holtzmann was severely taken to task by several writers in the "International Critical Commentary". The activity of so many acute minds has thrown great light on the language and literature of the Bible.

[[File:Wiki-mam-intcs.png|thumb|right|An illustration of mammary intercourse]]
&lt;!-- If you don't like the above image - create a suitable replacement. --&gt;
'''Mammary intercourse''' is a [[Human sexual activity|sex act]], performed as either [[foreplay]] or as [[non-penetrative sex]], that involves the stimulation of the male [[Human penis|penis]] by the female [[breast]]s and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Alex Comfort 1972 p. 67-9"&gt;Alex Comfort, ''The Joy of Sex'' (1972) p. 67-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
Mammary intercourse involves the male placing his [[Erection|erect]] penis in the female's [[Cleavage (breasts)|cleavage]], then starting to rub or [[pelvic thrust|thrust]] between her breasts, while the breasts are squeezed around the penile shaft, creating a tight area for stimulation.&lt;ref name="Alex Comfort 1972 p. 67-9"/&gt; In addition, the woman may move her breasts up and down against the penis for an additional stimulation. The act may be carried out face to face, or head to tail, with the woman recommended to be on top if she has smaller breasts.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Comfort, ''The Joy of Sex'' (1972) p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; When performed as a non-penetrative sex act, the act is continued until the point of [[ejaculation]] for the man.

Mammary intercourse is said by [[Alex Comfort]] to produce mutual orgasm in women with sensitive breasts (what [[Margot Anand]] terms ''local orgasms of the breast''),&lt;ref&gt;Alex Comfort, ''The Joy of Sex'' (1972) p. 69 and p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margo Ananad, ''The Art of Sexual Ecstasy'' (1990) p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; and it was one of the nine substitute exercises for [[Sexual penetration|penetrative]] sexual activities, as detailed in the ''Paradis Charnels'' of 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Comfort, ''The Joy of Sex'' (1972) p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; This act can be combined with [[fellatio]].

Since mammary intercourse is a non-penetrative sex act, the risk of passing a [[sexually transmitted infection]] (STI) that requires direct contact between the [[mucous membranes]] and [[pre-ejaculate]] or [[semen]] is greatly reduced. [[HIV]] is among the infections that require such direct contact and is therefore very unlikely to be transmitted via mammary intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kelly|first=Jeffrey A.|title = Advances in HIV/AIDS education and prevention|journal=Family Relations|volume=44|issue=4|pages=345–352|date=October 1995|issn=0197-6664|jstor=584989|doi=10.2307/584989}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the [[condom]] usage habits of New Zealand's [[sex worker]]s said that they offered various [[safe sex]] alternatives to [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal sex]] to clients who refused to wear a condom. One sex worker said that mammary intercourse was one alternative used; mammary intercourse performed by a woman with large breasts felt to the client like penetrative vaginal sex.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;Woods, 1996, in  Davis, pages 125-127&lt;/ref&gt;

Mammary intercourse has sometimes been considered a [[perversion]].&lt;ref&gt;Clifford Allen, ''A Textbook of Psychosexual Disorders'' (1969) p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], however, considered such extensions of sexual interest to fall within the range of the normal, unless marked out by exclusivity (i.e. the repudiation of all other forms of sexual contact).&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) p. 65 and p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slang terms==
Mammary intercourse is known as ''titty-fucking'', ''titfuck'', ''titjob'' or ''boob job'' in the United States, as well as ''tit wank'' or ''French fuck'' in the United Kingdom&lt;ref name=french&gt;Godson, page 96.&lt;/ref&gt; - the latter term dating back to the 1930s; while a more jocular equivalent is ''a trip down mammary lane''.&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Morton, ''The Lover's Tongue'' (2003) p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese [[sex industry]] uses the term ''paizuri''. ''Paizuri'' in the [[Japanese writing system]] is パイズリ with the first part パイ being from the word おっぱい (pronounced as ''oppai'') which is a slang word for breast, and the second part ズリ being from the word 擦り (pronounced as ''zuri'') which means "rub".&lt;ref&gt;Bacarr, 2004, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Constantine, 1992, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Memento mori''''' ([[Latin]]: "remember (that) you will die")&lt;ref name='oed'&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/memento-mori Literally 'remember (that you have) to die'], [[Oxford English Dictionary]], Third Edition, June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; is the medieval [[Latin Christian]] theory and practice of reflection on mortality, especially as a means of considering the [[Vanitas|vanity of earthly life]] and the [[transient nature of all earthly goods]] and pursuits. It is related to the ''[[ars moriendi]]'' ("The Art of Dying") and similar Western literature. ''Memento mori'' has been an important part of ascetic disciplines as a means of perfecting the character by cultivating detachment and other virtues, and by turning the attention towards the immortality of the soul and the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;See Jeremy Taylor, ''[[Holy Living and Holy Dying]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In art, ''memento mori'' are artistic or symbolic reminders of mortality.&lt;ref name='oed' /&gt; In the European [[Christian art]] context, "the expression [...] developed with the growth of Christianity, which emphasized Heaven, Hell, and [[salvation]] of the soul in the afterlife".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Farewell: The Culture of Death and the Afterlife|url=http://maa.missouri.edu/exhibitions/finalfarewell/mementointro.html|publisher=Museum of Art and Archaeology, University of Missouri|accessdate=13 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606051921/http://maa.missouri.edu/exhibitions/finalfarewell/mementointro.html|archivedate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pronunciation and translation==
In English, the phrase is pronounced {{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|m|ɛ|n|t|oʊ|_|ˈ|m|ɔr|i}}, {{respell|mə|MEN|toh|_|MOR|ee}}.

''Memento'' is the [[wikt:second-person singular|2nd person singular]] [[Future tense|future]] [[Active voice|active]] [[Imperative mood|imperative]] of ''meminī'', "to remember, to bear in mind", usually serving as a warning: "remember!" ''Mori'' is the [[Present tense|present]] [[Active voice|active]] [[infinitive]] of the [[deponent verb]] ''morior'', literally "to die".&lt;ref&gt;Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''[[A Latin Dictionary]]'', ''ss.vv.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, "remember death" or "remember that you will die".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Third Edition, ''[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/233960 s.v.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==

===In classical antiquity===
[[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'', where the death of [[Socrates]] is recounted, introduces the idea that the proper practice of philosophy is "about nothing else but dying and being dead".&lt;ref&gt;''Phaedo'', 64a4.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stoics]] of [[classical antiquity]] were particularly prominent in their use of this discipline, and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s letters are full of injunctions to meditate on death.&lt;ref&gt;See his [[Epistulae morales ad Lucilium|''Moral Letters to Lucilius'']].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Stoic [[Epictetus]] told his students that when kissing their child, brother, or friend, they should remind themselves that they are mortal, curbing their pleasure, as do "those who stand behind men in their triumphs and remind them that they are mortal"&lt;ref&gt;Epictetus, Discourses, 3.24&lt;/ref&gt;

===In early Christianity ===
The 2nd-century CE Christian writer [[Tertullian]] claimed that during his [[Roman triumph|triumphal procession]], a victorious general would have someone (in later versions, a slave) standing behind him, holding a crown over his head and whispering "Respice post te. Hominem te memento" ("Look after you [to the time after your death] and remember you're [only] a man."). Though in modern times this has become a standard [[Trope (literature)|trope]], in fact no ancient authors attest to this, and it may have been Christian moralizing rather than an accurate historical report.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], ''The Roman Triumph'', [[Harvard University Press]], 2009, {{ISBN|0674032187}}, p. 85–92&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Europe from the Medieval era to the Victorian era===
[[File:Dance of Death (replica of 15th century fresco; National Gallery of Slovenia).jpg|300px|thumb|''[[Danse Macabre|Dance of Death]]'' (15th-century fresco). No matter one's station in life, the Dance of Death unites all.]]
[[File:TombStJohnsChester.JPG|thumb|upright|Unshrouded skeleton on [[Diana Warburton]]'s tomb (dated 1693) in [[St John the Baptist's Church, Chester|St John the Baptist Church]], [[Chester]]]]
The thought was then utilized in [[Christianity]], whose strong emphasis on [[divine judgment]], [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]], [[Hell in Christian beliefs|hell]], and the [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation of the soul]] brought death to the forefront of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Dogmatics, Volume 2 (Carl E. Braaten, Robert W. Jenson), page 583&lt;/ref&gt; All ''memento mori'' works are products of [[Christian art]].&lt;ref&gt;Christian Art (Rowena Loverance), Harvard University Press, page 61&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Christian context, the ''memento mori'' acquires a moralizing purpose quite opposed to the ''[[nunc est bibendum]]'' (now is the time to drink) theme of [[classical antiquity]]. To the Christian, the prospect of death serves to emphasize the emptiness and fleetingness of earthly pleasures, luxuries, and achievements, and thus also as an invitation to focus one's thoughts on the prospect of the afterlife. A Biblical injunction often associated with the ''memento mori'' in this context is ''In omnibus operibus tuis memorare novissima tua, et in aeternum non peccabis'' (the [[Vulgate]]'s Latin rendering of [[Sirach|Ecclesiasticus]] {{bibleverse-nb||Ecclesiasticus|7:40}}, "in all thy works be mindful of thy last end and thou wilt never sin.") This finds ritual expression in the rites of [[Ash Wednesday]], when ashes are placed upon the worshipers' heads with the words, "Remember Man that you are dust and unto dust you shall return."

[[File:Le Transi de René de Chalon (Ligier Richier).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Prince of Orange]] [[René of Châlon]] died in 1544 at age 25. His widow commissioned sculptor Ligier Richier to represent in the [[Cadaver Tomb of René of Chalon]] which shows him offering his heart to God, set against the painted splendour of his former worldly estate. Church of Saint-Étienne, [[Bar-le-Duc]].]]
The most obvious places to look for ''memento mori'' meditations are in funeral art and [[architecture]]. Perhaps the most striking to contemporary minds is the ''transi'' or ''[[cadaver tomb]]'', a tomb that depicts the decayed [[Dead body|corpse]] of the deceased. This became a fashion in the tombs of the wealthy in the fifteenth century, and surviving examples still create a stark reminder of the vanity of earthly riches. Later, [[Puritan]] [[tomb stone]]s in the colonial United States frequently depicted winged skulls, skeletons, or [[angel]]s snuffing out candles. These are among the numerous [[Skull (mythology)|themes associated with skull imagery]].

Another example of ''memento mori'' is provided by the chapels of bones, such as the [[Capela dos Ossos]] in [[Évora]] or the [[Capuchin Crypt]] in Rome. These are chapels where the walls are totally or partially covered by human remains, mostly bones. The entrance to the Capela dos Ossos has the following sentence: "We bones, lying here bare, await yours."

The ''[[danse macabre]]'' is another well-known example of the ''memento mori'' theme, with its dancing depiction of the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]] carrying off rich and poor alike. This and similar depictions of Death decorated many European churches. ''Danse Macabre'', Op. 40, is a tone poem for orchestra written in 1874 by French composer [[Camille Saint-Saëns]].

Timepieces were formerly an apt reminder that your time on Earth grows shorter with each passing minute. Public [[clock]]s would be decorated with mottos such as ''ultima forsan'' ("perhaps the last" [hour]) or ''vulnerant omnes, ultima necat'' ("they all wound, and the last kills"). Even today, clocks often carry the motto ''[[tempus fugit]]'', "time flees". Old striking clocks often sported [[automaton|automata]] who would appear and strike the hour; some of the celebrated automaton clocks from [[Augsburg]], Germany had Death striking the hour. The several computerized "[[death clock]]s" revive this old idea. Private people carried smaller reminders of their own mortality. [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] owned a large watch carved in the form of a [[silver]] skull, embellished with the lines of Horace, "Pale death knocks with the same tempo upon the huts of the poor and the towers of Kings."

In the late 16th and through the 17th century, ''memento mori'' rings were made.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book |title=Finger Rings From Ancient Egypt to the Present Day |last=Taylor |first=Gerald |last2=Scarisbrick |first2=Diana |year=1978 |publisher=[[Ashmolean Museum]] |isbn=0-900090-54-5 |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of the theme in the artistic genre of still life is more often referred to as a ''[[vanitas]]'', Latin for "vanity". These include symbols of mortality, whether obvious ones such as skulls or more subtle ones such as a flower losing its petals. See the themes associated with [[Skull (symbolism)|the image of the skull]].
[[File:Young Man with a Skull, Frans Hals, National Gallery, London.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Frans Hals]], ''[[Young Man with a Skull]]'', c. 1626–28]]
[[File:StillLifeWithASkull.jpg|thumb|right|[[Philippe de Champaigne]]'s ''[[Vanitas]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1671) is reduced to three essentials: Life, Death, and Time]]

''Memento mori'' is also an important literary theme. Well-known literary meditations on death in English prose include Sir [[Thomas Browne]]'s ''[[Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial]]'' and [[Jeremy Taylor]]'s ''[[Holy Living and Holy Dying]]''. These works were part of a [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] [[melancholia|cult of melancholia]] that marked the end of the [[Elizabethan era]]. In the late eighteenth century, literary [[elegy|elegies]] were a common genre; [[Thomas Gray]]'s ''[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]'' and [[Edward Young]]'s ''Night Thoughts'' are typical members of the genre.

Apart from the genre of [[Music for the Requiem Mass|requiem]] and funeral music, there is also a rich tradition of ''memento mori'' in the [[Early Music]] of Europe. Especially those facing the ever-present death during the recurring [[bubonic plague]] [[pandemic]]s from the 1340s onward tried to toughen themselves by anticipating the inevitable in chants, from the simple [[Geisslerlieder]] of the [[Flagellant]] movement to the more refined cloistral or courtly songs. The lyrics often looked at life as a necessary and god-given [[vale of tears]] with death as a ransom, and they reminded people to lead sinless lives to stand a chance at [[Last Judgment|Judgment Day]]. The following two Latin stanzas (with their English translations) are typical of ''memento mori'' in medieval music; they are from the [[virelai]] ''ad mortem festinamus'' of the Catalan [[Llibre Vermell de Montserrat]] from 1399:
{{clear left}}
:''Vita brevis breviter in brevi finietur'',
:''Mors venit velociter quae neminem veretur'',
:''Omnia mors perimit et nulli miseretur.''
:''Ad mortem festinamus peccare desistamus.''

::Life is short, and shortly it will end;
::Death comes quickly and respects no one,
::Death destroys everything and takes pity on no one.
::To death we are hastening, let us refrain from sinning.

[[File:French - Pendant with a Monk and Death - Walters 71461.jpg|thumb|upright|French 16th/17th-century [[ivory]] [[pendant]], [[Monk]] and Death, recalling mortality and the certainty of death ([[Walters Art Museum]])]]
:''Ni conversus fueris et sicut puer factus''
:''Et vitam mutaveris in meliores actus,''
:''Intrare non poteris regnum Dei beatus.''
:''Ad mortem festinamus peccare desistamus.''

::If you do not turn back and become like a child,
::And change your life for the better,
::You will not be able to enter, blessed, the Kingdom of God.
::To death we are hastening, let us refrain from sinning.

===The salutation of the Hermits of St. Paul of France===
''Memento mori'' was the salutation used by the [[Hermits of St. Paul of France]] (1620-1633), also known as the Brothers of Death.&lt;ref&gt;F. McGahan, "Paulists", ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', 1912, ''[[s.v.]]'' Paulists&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes claimed that the [[Trappists]] use this salutation, but this is not true.&lt;ref&gt;E. Obrecht, "Trappists", ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1912, ''s.v.'' Trappists&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Self-Portrait by Thomas Smith circa 1680.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Thomas Smith (American painter)|Thomas Smith]]'s ''Self-Portrait'']]

===In Puritan America===
[[Colonial American art]] saw a large number of ''memento mori'' images due to [[Puritan]] influence. The Puritan community in 17th-century North America looked down upon art because they believed that it drew the faithful away from God and, if away from God, then it could only lead to the devil. However, portraits were considered historical records and, as such, they were allowed. [[Thomas Smith (American painter)|Thomas Smith]], a 17th-century Puritan, fought in many naval battles and also painted. In his self-portrait, we see these pursuits represented alongside a typical Puritan ''memento mori'' with a skull, suggesting his awareness of imminent death.

The poem underneath the skull emphasizes Thomas Smith's acceptance of death and of turning away from the world of the living:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why why should I the World be minding, Therein a World of Evils Finding. Then Farwell World: Farwell thy jarres, thy Joies thy Toies thy Wiles thy Warrs. Truth Sounds Retreat: I am not sorye. The Eternall Drawes to him my heart, By Faith (which can thy Force Subvert) To Crowne me (after Grace) with Glory.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mexico's Day of the Dead===
[[File:Posada2.Catrina.jpeg|thumb|left|[[José Guadalupe Posada|Posada's]] 1910 ''[[La Calavera Catrina]]'']]
Much ''memento mori'' art is associated with the [[Mexican culture|Mexican festival]] [[Day of the Dead]], including skull-shaped candies and bread loaves adorned with bread "bones."

This theme was also famously expressed in the works of the Mexican engraver [[José Guadalupe Posada]], in which people from various walks of life are depicted as skeletons.

[[File:Calavera_garbancera.png|thumb|[[José Guadalupe Posada|Posada's]] ''[[Calavera Garbancera]]'']]
Another manifestation of ''memento mori'' is found in the Mexican "Calavera", a literary composition in verse form normally written in honour of a person who is still alive, but written as if that person were dead. These compositions have a comedic tone and are often offered from one friend to another during [[Day of the Dead]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Brandes. "Skulls to the Living, Bread to the Dead: The Day of the Dead in Mexico and Beyond". Chapter 5: The Poetics of Death. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar concepts in other religions and cultures==
===In Buddhism===
The Buddhist practice [[Maranasati|''maraṇasati'']] meditates on death. The word is a Pāli compound of ''maraṇa'' 'death' (an Indo-European cognate of Latin ''mori'') and ''sati'' 'awareness', so very close to ''memento mori''. It is first used in early Buddhist texts, the [[Sutta Pitaka|suttapiṭaka]] of the [[Pāli Canon]], with parallels in the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|āgamas]] of the "Northern" Schools.

===In Japanese Zen and samurai culture===
In Japan, the influence of [[Zen]] Buddhist contemplation of death on indigenous culture can be gauged by the following quotation from the classic treatise on [[samurai]] ethics, ''[[Hagakure]]'':&lt;ref&gt;See a [http://themathesontrust.org/library/hagakure-book-of-the-samurai revised selection here].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Way of the Samurai is, morning after morning, the practice of death, considering whether it will be here or be there, imagining the most sightly way of dying, and putting one's mind firmly in death. Although this may be a most difficult thing, if one will do it, it can be done. There is nothing that one should suppose cannot be done.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.urbandharma.org/kusala/dad.html "A Buddhist Guide to Death, Dying and Suffering"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the annual appreciation of cherry blossom and fall colours, ''[[hanami]]'' and ''[[Leaf peeping|momijigari]]'', the samurai philosophised that things are most splendid at the moment before their fall, and to aim to live and die in a similar fashion.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== In Tibetan Buddhism ===
[[File:Tibetan Mask.jpg|thumb|Tibetan [[Citipati (Buddhism)|Citipati]] mask depicting [[Mahākāla]]. The skull mask of Citipati is a reminder of the impermanence of life and the eternal cycle of life and death.]]
In Tibetan Buddhism, there is a mind training practice known as [[Lojong]]. The initial stages of the classic Lojong begin with 'The Four Thoughts that Turn the Mind', or, more literally, 'Four Contemplations to Cause a Revolution in the Mind'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Four_thoughts&lt;/ref&gt; The second of these four is the contemplation on impermanence and death. In particular, one contemplates that; 
* All compounded things are impermanent. 
* The human body is a compounded thing. 
* Therefore, death of the body is certain. 
* The time of death is uncertain and beyond our control.

There are a number of classic verse formulations of these contemplations meant for daily reflection to overcome our strong habitual tendency to live as though we will certainly not die today.

==== Lalitavistara Sutra ====
The following is from the [[Lalitavistara Sūtra]], a major work in the classical Sanskrit canon:

अध्रुवं त्रिभवं शरदभ्रनिभं नटरङ्गसमा जगिर् ऊर्मिच्युती। गिरिनद्यसमं लघुशीघ्रजवं व्रजतायु जगे यथ विद्यु नभे॥
The three worlds are fleeting like autumn clouds. 
Like a staged performance, beings come and go. 
In tumultuous waves, rushing by, like rapids over a cliff. 
Like lightning, wanderers in samsara burst into existence, and are gone in a flash.

ज्वलितं त्रिभवं जरव्याधिदुखैः मरणाग्निप्रदीप्तमनाथमिदम्। भवनि शरणे सद मूढ जगत् भ्रमती भ्रमरो यथ कुम्भगतो॥
Beings are ablaze with the sufferings of sickness and old age, 
And with no defence against the conflagration of Death 
The bewildered, seeking refuge in worldly existence 
Spin round and round, like bees trapped in a jar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-046-001.html Lalitavistara Sutra]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Udānavarga ====
A very well known verse in the Pali, Sanskrit and Tibetan canons states [this is from the Sanskrit version, the Udānavarga:

सर्वे क्षयान्ता निचयाः पतनान्ताः समुच्छ्रयाः |
सम्योगा विप्रयोगान्ता मरणान्तं हि जीवितम् |1,22| 
All that is acquired will be lost
What rises will fall
Where there is meeting there will be separation
What is born will surely die.&lt;ref&gt;Udānavarga, 1:22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shantideva, Bodhicaryavatara ====
[[Shantideva]], in the [[Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra]] 'Bodhisattva's Way of Life' reflects at length:

कृताकृतापरीक्षोऽयं मृत्युर्विश्रम्भघातकः।
स्वस्थास्वस्थैरविश्वास्य आकमिस्मकमहाशनि:॥ २/३४॥
Death does not differentiate between tasks done and undone.
This traitor is not to be trusted by the healthy or the ill, 
for it is like an unexpected, great thunderbolt. BCA 2.33

अप्रिया न भविष्यन्ति प्रियो मे न भविष्यति।
अहं च न भविष्यामि सर्वं च न भविष्यति॥२/३७॥
My enemies will not remain, nor will my friends remain.
I shall not remain. Nothing will remain. BCA 2:35

तत्तत्स्मरणताम याति यद्यद्वस्त्वनुभयते।
स्वप्नानुभूतवत्सर्वं गतं न पूनरीक्ष्यते॥२/३६॥
Whatever is experienced will fade to a memory. 
Like an experience in a dream, 
everything that has passed will not be seen again. BCA 2:36

रात्रिन्दिवमविश्राममायुषो वर्धते व्ययः।
आयस्य चागमो नास्ति न मरिष्यामि किं न्वहम्॥२/४०
Day and night, a life span unceasingly diminishes, 
and there is no adding onto it. Shall I not die then? BCA 2:39

यमदूतैर्गृहीतस्य कुतो बन्धुः कुतः सुह्रत्। पुण्यमेकं तदा त्राणं मया तच्च न सेवितम्॥२/४१॥
For a person seized by the messengers of Death, 
what good is a relative and what good is a friend? 
At that time, merit alone is a protection, 
and I have not applied myself to it. BCA 2:41

==== In more modern Tibetan Buddhist works====

In a practice text written by the 19th century Tibetan master '''[[Dudjom Lingpa]]''' for serious meditators, he formulates the second contemplation in this way.&lt;ref&gt;"Foolish Dharma of an Idiot Clothed in Mud and Feathers, in 'Dujdom Lingpa's Visions of the Great Perfection, Volume 1', B. Alan Wallace (translator), Wisdom Publications"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisdompubs.org/book/natural-liberation&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Z7bVFdFdlEfoPdRSHHnXc&lt;/ref&gt; An oral commentary by the translator is available on YouTube here.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DPjVFPj32OoI&amp;usg=AOvVaw1yy8WwuFRkqWm5MKyD28-X&lt;/ref&gt;
''"On this occasion when you have such a bounty of opportunities in terms of your body, environment, friends, spiritual mentors, time, and practical instructions, without procrastinating until tomorrow and the next day, arouse a sense of urgency, as if a spark landed on your body or a grain of sand fell in your eye. If you have not swiftly applied yourself to practice, examine the births and deaths of other beings and reflect again and again on the unpredictability of your lifespan and the time of your death, and on the uncertainty of your own situation. Meditate on this until you have definitively integrated it with your mind... The appearances of this life, including your surroundings and friends, are like last night’s dream, and this life passes more swiftly than a flash of lightning in the sky. 
There is no end to this meaningless work. What a joke to prepare to live forever! 
Wherever you are born in the heights or depths of saṃsāra, the great noose of suffering will hold you tight. 
Acquiring freedom for yourself is as rare as a star in the daytime, so how is it possible to practice and achieve liberation? The root of all mind training and practical instructions is planted by knowing the nature of existence. There is no other way.I, an old vagabond, have shaken my beggar’s satchel, and this is what came out."''

The contemporary Tibetan master, '''Yangthang Rinpoche''', in his short text 'Summary of the View, Meditation, and Conduct':&lt;ref&gt;The English text is available [http://meridian-trust.org/meridian_site/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/A-Summary-of-the-View-Meditation-and-Conduct.pdf here.] The Tibetan text is available [http://www.lotsawahouse.org/bo/tibetan-masters/yangthang-rinpoche/view-meditation-action here.] Oral Commentary by a student of Rinpoche, B.

Reflect again and again on the difficulty Of obtaining such a fine human life. 
If you do not make this meaningful, 
It will be like a butter lamp in the wind of impermanence. 
Do not count on this lasting a long time.''

The Tibetan Canon also includes copious materials on the meditative preparation for the death process and intermediate period [bardo] between death and rebirth. Amongst them are the famous "Tibetan Book of the Dead", in Tibetan ''[[Bardo Thodol]]'', the "Natural Liberation through Hearing in the Bardo".

===In Islam===
The "remembrance of death" ({{lang-ar|تذكرة الموت}}, ''Tadhkirat al-Mawt'') has been a major topic of Islamic spirituality (i.e. "tazkiya" meaning self-purification, or purification of the heart) since the time of the Prophet Muhammad in Medina. It is grounded in the [[Qur'an]], where there are recurring injunctions to pay heed to the fate of previous generations.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, sura "Yasin", 36:31, "Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, which indeed returned not unto them?".&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hadith]] literature, which preserves the teachings of Prophet Muhammad, records advice for believers to "remember often death, the destroyer of pleasures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/riyadussaliheen/1/579|title=Hadith - The Book of Miscellany - Riyad as-Salihin -  Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Sufism|Sufis]] have been called "ahl al-qubur," the "people of the graves," because of their practice of frequenting graveyards to ponder on mortality and the vanity of life, based on the teaching of the Prophet Muhammad to visit graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/abudawud/21/147|title=Hadith - Book of Funerals (Kitab Al-Jana'iz) - Sunan Abi Dawud -  Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Ghazali]] devotes to this topic the last book of his "Revival of the Religious Sciences".&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ghazali on Death and the Afterlife, tr. by [[Timothy Winter|T.J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9323">[[File:Las Meninas, by Diego Velázquez, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Las Meninas]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]], used by [[André Gide|Gide]] to demonstrate the technique of ''mise en abyme'']]
In [[Western art history]], '''''Mise en abyme''''' ({{IPA-fr|miz ɑ̃n‿abim}}; also '''''mise en abîme''''') is a formal technique of placing a copy of an image within itself, often in a way that suggests an infinitely recurring sequence. In film theory and literary theory, it refers to the technique of inserting a story within a story. The term is derived from [[heraldry]] and literally means "placed into [[Abyss (religion)|abyss]]". It was first appropriated for modern criticism by the French author [[André Gide]].

A common sense of the phrase is the visual experience of standing between two [[mirror]]s, seeing as a result an infinite reproduction of one's image.&lt;ref name="Rheinhardt2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rheinhardt|first=Dagmar|title=Youtopia. a Passion for the Dark: Architecture at the Intersection Between Digital Processes and Theatrical Performance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=38_ZvEwnGtQC&amp;pg=PT42|year=2012|publisher=Freerange Press|isbn=978-0-9808689-1-3|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the [[Droste effect]], in which a picture appears within itself, in a place where a similar picture would realistically be expected to appear.&lt;ref&gt;Nänny. Max and Fischer, Olga, ''The Motivated Sign: Iconicity in Language and Literature'' p.&amp;nbsp;37, John Benjamins Publishing Company (2001) {{ISBN|90-272-2574-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is named after the 1904 [[Droste]] cocoa package, which depicts a woman holding a tray bearing a Droste cocoa package, which bears a smaller version of her image.&lt;ref&gt;Törnqvist, Egil. ''Ibsen: A Doll's House'', p. 105, Cambridge University Press (1995) {{ISBN|0-521-47866-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heraldry==
[[File:Royal Arms of United Kingdom (1816-1837).svg|thumb|left|Coat of arms of the United Kingdom 1816–37]]
In the terminology of [[heraldry]], the ''abyme'' is the center of a [[coat of arms]]. The term ''mise en abyme'' then meant put in the center. It described a coat of arms that appears as a smaller shield in the center of a larger one (see [[Droste effect]]).

A complex example of ''mise en abyme'' is seen in the [[coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom#After the Acts of Union 1707|for the period 1816–1837]], as used by [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. The [[crown of Charlemagne]] is placed ''en abyme'' within the [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] of [[Hanover]], which in turn is ''en abyme'' within the arms of England, Scotland, and Ireland.

Another example is the two-headed eagle in the modern [[coat of arms of Russia]], which holds a [[sceptre]] topped by a similar eagle holding a similar sceptre.

==Medieval examples==
[[File:Istanbul.Hagia Sophia075.jpg|thumb|300px|Southwestern entrance mosaic of Hagia Sophia in Constantinople, depicting both Hagia Sophia itself and Constantinople, both offered to Jesus and the Virgin Mary]]
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

While [[art historian]]s working on the early-modern period adopted this phrase and interpreted it as showing artistic "self awareness", medievalists tended not to use it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Many examples, however, can be found in the pre-modern era, as in a [[mosaic]] from the [[Hagia Sophia]] dated to the year 944. To the left, [[Justinian I]] offers the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] the Hagia Sophia, which contains the mosaic itself. To the right, [[Constantine I]] offers the city of [[Constantinople]] (now known as Istanbul), which itself contains the Hagia Sophia.

More medieval examples can be found in the collection of articles ''Medieval mise-en-abyme: the object depicted within itself'',&lt;ref name='mise'/&gt; in which Stuart Whatling conjectures that the self-references sometimes are used to strengthen the symbolism of gift-giving by documenting the act of giving on the object itself. An example of this self-referential gift-giving appears in the [[Stefaneschi Triptych]] in the [[Vatican Museum]], which features Cardinal [[Giacomo Gaetani Stefaneschi]] as the giver of the altarpiece.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/PIN/PIN_Sala02_03.html Giotto di Bondone and assistants: Stefaneschi triptych&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical theory and art history==
In [[Western art history]], ''mise en abyme'' is a formal technique in which an image contains a smaller copy of itself, in a sequence appearing to recur infinitely; "[[recursion|recursive]]" is another term for this. The modern meaning of the phrase originates with the author [[André Gide]] who used it to describe self-reflexive embeddings in various art forms and to describe what he sought in his own work.&lt;ref name='mise'&gt;[http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/researchforum/projects/medievalarttheory/documents/Mise-en-abyme.pdf Medieval ''mise-en-abyme'': the object depicted within itself (collection of papers)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102033517/http://www.courtauld.ac.uk/researchforum/projects/medievalarttheory/documents/Mise-en-abyme.pdf |date=2013-11-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As examples, Gide cites both paintings such as ''[[Las Meninas]]'' by [[Diego Velázquez]] and literary forms such as [[William Shakespeare]]'s use of the "play within a play" device in ''[[Hamlet]]'', where a theatrical company presents a performance for the characters that illuminates a thematic aspect of the play itself. This use of the phrase ''mise en abyme'' was picked up by scholars and popularized in the 1977 book ''Le récit spéculaire. Essai sur la mise en abyme'' by [[Lucien Dällenbach]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucien Dällenbach, ''Le récit spéculaire. Essai sur la mise en abyme'', Paris, Seuil, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature and film==
''Mise en abyme'' occurs within a text when there is a reduplication of images or concepts referring to the textual whole. ''Mise en abyme'' is a play of signifiers within a text, of sub-texts mirroring each other. &lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Susan. "Mise-en-abime" in ''Cinema Studies: The Key Concepts'' (Third Edition). Routledge, 2006. p. 252-253&lt;/ref&gt; This mirroring can attain a level where meaning may become unstable and, in this respect, may be seen as part of the process of [[deconstruction]]. The film-within-a-film, where a film contains a plot about the making of a movie, is an example of ''mise en abyme''. The film being made within the film refers, through its ''[[mise en scène]]'', to the real film being made. The spectator sees film equipment, stars getting ready for the take, crew sorting out the various directorial needs. The narrative of the film within the film may directly reflect the one in the real film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/hfs.cgi/00/3265.ctl|Hayward, Susan. ''Cinema Studies Key Concepts''. New York: Routledge, 2006.] Accessed 2009-05-27&lt;/ref&gt; An example is ''[[La Nuit américaine]]'' (1973) by [[François Truffaut]].

In [[film]], the meaning of ''mise en abyme'' is similar to the artistic definition, but also includes the idea of a "dream within a dream". For example, a character awakens from a dream and later discovers that s/he is [[false awakening|still dreaming]]. Activities similar to dreaming, such as unconsciousness and virtual reality, also are described as ''mise en abyme''. This is seen in the film ''[[eXistenZ]]'' where the two protagonists never truly know whether or not they are out of the game. It also becomes a prominent element of [[Charlie Kaufman]]'s ''[[Synecdoche, New York]]'' (2008). A more recent instance can be found in the film ''[[Inception]]'' (2010).  Classic filmic examples include the snow globe in ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1941) which provides a clue to the film's core mystery, and the discussion of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s written works (particularly "[[The Purloined Letter]]") in the [[Jean-Luc Godard]] film ''[[Band of Outsiders]]'' (1964). 

In [[literary criticism]], ''mise en abyme'' is a type of [[frame story]], in which the core narrative may be used to illuminate some aspect of the framing story. The term is used in deconstruction and deconstructive literary criticism as a paradigm of the [[Intertextuality|intertextual]] nature of language, that is, of the way language never quite reaches the foundation of reality because it refers in a frame-within-a-frame way, to other language, which refers to other language, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ross Chambers |title=Story and Situation: Narrative Seduction and the Power of Fiction |year=1984 |url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/story-and-situation}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=April 2017}}

Both committees aim to foster intellectual exchange among scholars and students interested in all fields of art history. They organize scholarly conferences and promote the communication, dissemination and exchange of knowledge and information about art history in order to promote a global community of art historians. 

The NCHA is supported by the [[Getty Foundation]] and interested in developing global networks of art historians, particularly in areas of the world in which art history is an emerging discipline. Therefore, it brings together art historians from Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and Eastern Europe for discussions on the state of the discipline. The NCHA also provides travel support to congresses for students enrolled in US doctoral programs.

The current president of the NCHA is [[Marc Gotlieb]], Director of the Graduate Program and Class of 1955 Memorial Professor of Art at [[Williams College]], [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3550">The '''National Root Crops Research Institute''', [[Umudike]], [[Abia State]] is an agricultural research institute in [[Nigeria]].
Its origins can be traced back to an experimental farm established at Moor Plantation, [[Ibadan]] on January 1, 1923 by the [[Nigerian Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Water Resources|Nigerian Department of Agriculture]].
The School of Agriculture was established in 1955, and the two establishments were combined as the Eastern Nigeria Agricultural Research and Training Station (ARTS) in 1956, with headquarters at [[Enugu]]. In 1972, the institution assumed federal status as the Federal Agricultural Research and Training Station (FARTS). In 1976 it was renamed the National Root Crops Research Institute, coming under the Agricultural Research Council of Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The institute conducts research into genetic improvement of economically important root and tuber crops such as cassava, yam, cocoyam, sweet potato, Irish potato, ginger, rizga, Hausa potato, sugar beets and Turmeric. It also researches subjects such as crop cultivation techniques, storage, processing and utilization of the crops, concentrating on requirements of farmers in the south-east zone of Nigeria. The institute provides training of middle level agricultural workers, awarding National Diplomas and Higher National Diplomas and providing specialized vocational training to farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An '''objective structured clinical examination''' ('''OSCE''') is a modern&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.5955.447 |title=Assessment of clinical competence using objective structured examination |journal=BMJ |volume=1 |issue=5955 |pages=447–451 |year=1975 |last1=Harden |first1=R M |last2=Stevenson |first2=M |last3=Downie |first3=W W |last4=Wilson |first4=G M }}&lt;/ref&gt; type of examination often used in health sciences (e.g. audiology, midwifery, occupational therapy, optometry, orthoptics,  medicine, physician assistants/associates, physical therapy, radiography, athletic training, rehabilitation medicine, dietetics, nursing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2648.1988.tb01390.x |pmid=3372885 |title=Using the OSCE to measure clinical skills performance in nursing |journal=Journal of Advanced Nursing |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=45–56 |year=1988 |last1=Ross |first1=Margaret |last2=Carroll |first2=Giséle |last3=Knight |first3=Janet |last4=Chamberlain |first4=Marie |last5=Fothergill-Bourbonnais |first5=Francis |last6=Linton |first6=Jeanette }}&lt;/ref&gt; pharmacy, dentistry, chiropractic, paramedicine, podiatry, veterinary medicine, athletic training). It is designed to test clinical skill performance and competence in skills such as [[communication]], [[clinical examination]], medical procedures / prescription, exercise prescription, joint mobilisation / manipulation techniques, radiographic positioning, radiographic image evaluation and interpretation of results. It is a hands-on, real-world approach to learning that keeps examinees engaged, allows them to understand the key factors that drive the medical decision-making process, and challenges the professional to be innovative and reveals their errors in case-handling and provides an open space for improved decision-making, based on evidence-based practice for real-world responsibilities.

==OSCE design==
An OSCE usually comprises a circuit of short (the usual is 5–10 minutes although some use up to 15 minute) stations, in which each candidate is examined on a one-to-one basis with one or two impartial examiner(s) and either real or simulated (actors or electronic patient simulators) [[patient]]s. Each station has a different examiner, as opposed to the traditional method of clinical examinations where a candidate would be assigned to an examiner for the entire examination. Candidates rotate through the stations, completing all the stations on their circuit. In this way, all candidates take the same stations. It is considered to be an improvement over traditional examination methods because the stations can be [[standardisation|standardised]] enabling fairer peer comparison and complex procedures can be assessed without endangering patients health.

As the name suggests, an OSCE is designed to be ''objective'' – all candidates are assessed using exactly the same stations (although if real patients are used, their signs may vary slightly) with the same marking scheme. In an OSCE, candidates get marks for each step on the mark scheme that they perform correctly, which therefore makes the assessment of clinical skills more objective, rather than subjective, ''structured'' – stations in OSCEs have a very specific task. Where simulated patients are used, detailed scripts are provided to ensure that the information that they give is the same to all candidates, including the emotions that the patient should use during the consultation. Instructions are carefully written to ensure that the candidate is given a very specific task to complete. The OSCE is carefully structured to include parts from all elements of the curriculum as well as a wide range of skills. ''A clinical examination'' - the OSCE is designed to apply clinical and theoretical knowledge. Where theoretical knowledge is required, for example, answering questions from the examiner at the end of the station, then the questions are standardized and the candidate is only asked questions that are on the mark sheet and if the candidate is asked any others then there will be no marks for them.

==OSCE marking==
Marking in OSCEs is done by the examiner. Occasionally written stations, for example, writing a prescription chart, are used and these are marked like written examinations, again usually using a standardized mark sheet. One of the ways an OSCE is made objective is by having a detailed mark scheme and standard set of questions. For example, a station concerning the demonstration to a simulated patient on how to use a [[metered dose inhaler]] [MDI] would award points for specific actions which are performed safely and accurately. The examiner can often vary the marks depending on how well the candidate performed the step. At the end of the mark sheet, the examiner often has a small number of marks that they can use to weight the station depending on performance and if a simulated patient is used, then they are often asked to add marks depending on the candidates approach. At the end, the examiner is often asked to give a "global score". This is usually used as a subjective score based on the candidates overall performance, not taking into account how many marks the candidate scored. The examiner is usually asked to rate the candidate as pass/borderline/fail or sometimes as excellent/good/pass/borderline/fail. This is then used to determine the individual pass mark for the station.

Many centres allocate each station an individual pass mark. The sum of the pass marks of all the stations determines the overall pass mark for the OSCE. Many centres also impose a minimum number of stations required to pass which ensures that a consistently poor performance is not compensated by a good performance on a small number of stations.

There are, however, criticisms that the OSCE stations can never be truly standardized and objective in the same way as a written exam. It has been known for different patients / actors to afford more assistance, and for different marking criteria to be applied. Finally, it is not uncommon at certain institutions for members of teaching staff be known to students (and vice versa) as the examiner. This familiarity does not necessarily affect the integrity of the examination process, although there is a deviation from [[anonymous marking]]. However, in OSCEs that use several circuits of the same stations the marking is repeatedly shown to be very consistent which supports the validity that the OSCE is a fair clinical examination. There are arguments for and against quarantining OSCE examinees to prevent sharing of exam information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bma.org.uk/connecting-doctors/community_focus/b/future_docs_news/posts/calls-to-ensure-end-of-year-exam-fairness|title=Calls to ensure end-of-year exam fairness|work=BMA - Connecting doctors|access-date=2017-04-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the data tend to show no improvement in the overall scores in a later OSCE session, the research methodology is flawed and validity of the claim is questionable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/10/e012541.responses#sharing-of-information-in-objective-structured-clinical-examinations----does-no-evidence-of-difference-mean-evidence-of-no-difference|title=Sharing of information in objective structured clinical examinations -- does no evidence of difference mean evidence of no difference?|last=Yeung|first=E|date=April 2, 2017|website=BMJ Open|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study suggested that marks do not give a sound inference of student collusion in an OSCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jme.2005.015446 |pmid=17145916 |pmc=2563344 |title=The Objective Structured Clinical Examination and student collusion: Marks do not tell the whole truth |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=32 |issue=12 |pages=734–738 |year=2006 |last1=Parks |first1=R |last2=Warren |first2=P M |last3=Boyd |first3=K M |last4=Cameron |first4=H |last5=Cumming |first5=A |last6=Lloyd-Jones |first6=G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
Preparing for OSCEs is very different from preparing for an examination on  theory. In an OSCE, clinical skills are tested rather than pure theoretical knowledge. It is essential to learn correct clinical methods, and then practice repeatedly until one perfects the methods whilst simultaneously developing an understanding of the underlying theory behind the methods used. Marks are awarded for each step in the method; hence, it is essential to dissect the method into its individual steps, learn the steps, and then learn to perform the steps in a sequence.

Most universities have clinical skills labs where students have the opportunity to practice clinical skills such as taking blood or mobilizing patients in a safe and controlled environment. It is often very helpful to practise in small groups with colleagues, setting a typical OSCE scenario and timing it with one person role playing a patient, one person doing the task and if possible, one person either observing and commenting on technique or even role playing the examiner using a sample mark sheet. Many OSCE textbooks have sample OSCE stations and mark sheets that can be helpful when studying in the manner. In doing this the candidate is able to get a feel of running to time and working under pressure.

In many OSCEs the stations are extended using data interpretation. For example, the candidate may have to take a brief history of chest pain and then interpret an [[electrocardiogram]]. It is also common to be asked for a [[differential diagnosis]], to suggest which medical investigations the candidate would like to do or to suggest a management plan for the patient.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2104">'''PlanetQuest''' is [[NASA]]'s education and public outreach program centered on the science and technology of NASA’s long-term search for habitable planets beyond our solar system.

Major components of the PlanetQuest outreach program include:
* PlanetQuest: the Search for Another Earth, a continuously updated public news and multimedia Internet site;
* The Night Sky Network, a national coalition of amateur astronomy clubs who do astronomy education and public outreach on behalf of NASA;
* The Center for Astronomy Education, which provides professional development resources for instructors who teach introductory astronomy course, including a series of national “Teaching Excellence” workshops; 
* Informal education initiatives, including “PlanetQuest Updates” provided to more than 60 museums nationwide, and interactive multimedia kiosks. 

Begun in January 2002 and based at NASA’s [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], PlanetQuest is funded by the Exoplanet Exploration Program, a long-term suite of NASA missions designed to detect and characterize of Earth-like planets. The main components of Navigator include two ground-based and two space based missions:

On Earth:
* The [[Keck Interferometer]]. Initial interferometeric work began in 2005.
* The [[Large Binocular Telescope]] Interferometer.  Instrument that is part of the Large Binocular Telescope, which has been operational since 2005.
In space:
* [[SIM PlanetQuest]]. SIM Lite cancelled in 2010.
* The [[Terrestrial Planet Finder]] observatories. ''De facto'' cancelled.

'''Pre-Columbian art''' refers to the [[Visual arts of indigenous peoples of the Americas|visual arts of indigenous peoples]] of the [[Caribbean]], [[North America|North]],  [[Central America|Central]], and [[South America]]s until the late 15th and early 16th centuries, and the time period marked by [[Christopher Columbus]]' arrival in the Americas.

[[Pre-Columbian]] art thrived throughout the [[Americas]] from at least 13,000 BCE to the European conquests, and sometimes continued for a time afterwards. Many [[Pre-Columbian cultures]] did not have writing systems, so visual art expressed [[cosmology|cosmologies]], [[world view]]s, religion, and philosophy of these cultures, as well as serving as [[mnemonic]] devices.

During the period before and after [[Age of Discovery|European exploration]] and conquest of the Americas, indigenous native cultures produced a wide variety of visual arts, including painting on textiles, hides, rock and cave surfaces, bodies especially faces, ceramics, architectural features including interior murals, wood panels, and other available surfaces. For many of these cultures, the visual arts went beyond physical appearance and served as active extensions of their owners and indices of the divine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/981761498|title=Golden kingdoms : luxury arts in the ancient Americas|others=Pillsbury, Joanne,, Potts, Timothy F.,, Richter, Kim N.,, J. Paul Getty Museum,, Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York, N.Y.),, Getty Research Institute,|isbn=9781606065488|location=Los Angeles, CA|oclc=981761498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artisans of the Ancient Americas drew upon a wide range of materials ([[obsidian]], gold, [[spondylus]] shells), creating objects that included the meanings held to be inherent to the materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These cultures often derived value from the physical qualities, rather than the imagery, of artworks, prizing aural and tactile features, the quality of workmanship, and the rarity of materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Various works of art have been discovered large distances from their location of production, indicating that many Pre-Columbian civilizations collected items from other cultures or previous cultures. Moreover,
many societies used raw materials not available in the geographic location in which they were situated, suggesting difficulty of acquisition as a source of value.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/981761498|title=Golden kingdoms : luxury arts in the ancient Americas|others=Pillsbury, Joanne,, Potts, Timothy F.,, Richter, Kim N.,, J.

==Mesoamerica and Central America==
The Mesoamerican cultures are generally divided into three periods (see [[Mesoamerican chronology]]):

*Pre-classic (up to 200 CE)
*Classic (ca. 200–900 CE)
*Post-classic (ca. 900 to 1580 CE).

The Pre-classic period was dominated by the highly developed [[Olmec]] civilization, which flourished around 1200–400 BCE. The Olmecs produced [[jade]] figurines, and created heavy-featured, [[Olmec colossal heads|colossal heads]], up to 2 meters (8&amp;nbsp;ft) high, that still stand mysteriously in the landscape. The Mesoamerican tradition of building large ceremonial centres appears to have begun under the Olmecs.

During the Classic period the dominant Civilization was the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]. Maya royalty commissioned artwork that commemorated their achievements and secured their place in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schele|first1=Linda, et al|title=The Blood of Kings: Dynasty and Ritual in Maya Art|date=2006|publisher=G. Braziller}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scenes depicting various rituals and historical events are embedded with hieroglyphic text to enable the viewer to identify the important figures, times and places instead of relying upon physical features that could be forgotten over time. The interpretation of the actions represented in the artwork goes hand in hand with  understanding the decorative text that is woven into the picture. Unlocking this hieroglyphic text is vital as it removes anonymity and mystery from the scenes and reveals detailed records of those who held power throughout the timeline of the civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schele|first1=Linda, et al|title=The Blood of Kings: Dynasty and Ritual in Maya Art|date=2006|publisher=G. Braziller}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Mississippian peoples of North America such as the Choctaw and Natchez, the Maya organized themselves into large, agricultural communities. They practised their own forms of [[Maya hieroglyphics|hieroglyphic writing]] and even advanced [[astronomy]]. Mayan art consequently focuses on rain, [[agriculture]], and [[fertility]], expressing these images mainly in relief and surface decoration, as well as some sculpture. [[Glyphs]] and stylized figures were used to decorate architecture such as the pyramid temple of [[Chichén Itzá]]. Murals dating from about 750 CE were discovered when the city of Bonampak was excavated in 1946.

The Post-classic period (10th–12th centuries) was dominated by the [[Toltecs]] who made colossal, block-like sculptures such as those employed as free-standing columns at Tula, [[Mexico]]. The [[Mixtecs]] developed a style of painting known as Mixtec-Puebla, as seen in their murals and codices (manuscripts), in which all available space is covered by flat figures in geometric designs. The [[Aztec]] culture in Mexico produced some dramatically expressive examples of Aztec art, such as the decorated skulls of captives and stone sculpture, of which Tlazolteotl (Woods Bliss Collection, Washington), a goddess in childbirth, is a good example.

==South America==
In the [[Andean]] region of South America (modern-day [[Peru]]), the [[Chavin culture|Chavín civilization]] flourished from around 1000 BCE to 300 BCE. The Chavín produced small-scale pottery, often human in shape but with animal features such as bird feet, reptilian eyes, or feline fangs. Representations of jaguar are a common theme in Chavín art. The Chavin culture is also noted for the spectacular murals and carvings found its main religious site of [[Chavin de Huantar]]; these works include the [[Raimondi Stela]], the [[Lanzón]], and the Tello Obelisk.

Contemporary with the Chavin was the '''[[Paracas culture]]''' of the southern coast of Peru, most noted today for their elaborate textiles. These amazing productions, some of which could measure ninety feet long, were primarily used for as burial wraps for Paracas mummy bundles. Paracas art was greatly influenced by the Chavín cult, and the two styles share many common motifs.

On the south coast, the Paracas were immediately succeeded by a flowering of artistic production around the [[Nazca]] river valley. The '''[[Nazca]]''' period is divided into eight ceramic phases, each one depicting increasingly abstract animal and human motifs. These period range from Phase 1, beginning around 200 CE, to Phase 8, which declined in the middle of the eighth century. The Nasca people are most famous for the [[Nazca lines]], though they are usually regarded as making some of the most beautiful polychrome ceramics in the Andes.

On the north coast, the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] succeeded the Chavin. The Moche flourished about 100–800 CE, and were among the best artisans of the Pre-Columbian world, producing [[Moche portrait vessel|delightful portrait vases]] (Moche ware), which, while realistic, are steeped in religious references, the significance of which is now lost. For the Moche, ceramics functioned as a primary way of disseminating information and cultural ideas. The Moche made ceramic vessels that depicted and re-created a plethora of objects: fruits, plants, animals, human portrais, gods, demons, as well as graphic depictions of sexual acts. The Moche are also noted for their metallurgy (such as that found in the tomb of the [[Lord of Sípan]]), as well as their architectural prowess, such as the [[Huaca de la Luna]] and the [[Huaca del Sol]] in the Moche River valley.

Following the decline of the Moche, two large co-existing empires emerged in the Andes region. In the north, the [[Huari culture|Wari]] (or Huari) Empire, based in their capital city of the same name. The Wari are noted for their stone architecture and sculpture accomplishments, but their greatest proficiency was ceramic. The Wari produced magnificent large ceramics, many of which depicted images of the [[Staff God]], an important deity in the Andes which during the Wari period had become specifically associated with the [[Lake Titicaca]] region on the modern Peru-Bolivia border. Similarly, the Wari's contemporaries of the [[Tiwanaku]] empire, also centered around a capital city of the same name, held the [[Staff God]] in similar esteem. Tiwanaku's empire began to expand out of  Titicaca around 400 BCE, but its "Classic Period" of artistic production and political power occurred between 375 and 700 CE. Tiwanaku is currently known for its magnificent imperial city on the southern side of Lake Titicaca, now in modern-day Bolivia. Especially famous is the [[Gate of the Sun]], which depicts a large image of the Staff God flanked by other religious symbols which may have functioned as a calendar.

Following the decline of the Wari Empire in the late first millennium, the [[Chimú]] people, centered out of their capital city of [[Chimor]] began to build their empire on the north and central coasts of Peru. The Chimú were preceded by a simple ceramic style known as [[Sican culture#Early Sican|Sicán]] (700-900 CE) which became increasingly decorative until it became recognizable as Chimú in the early second millennium. The Chimú produced excellent portrait and decorative works in metal, notably gold but especially silver. The Chimú also are noted for their featherwork, having produced many standards and headdresses made of a variety of tropical feathers which were fashioned into bired and fish designs, both of which were held in high esteem by the Chimú. The Chimú are best known for their magnificent palatial complex of [[Chan Chan]] just south of modern-day [[Trujillo, Peru]]; now a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The Chimú went into decline very quickly due to outside pressures and conquest from the expanding [[Inca Empire]] in the mid-15th century.

At the time of the Spanish conquest, the [[Inca Empire]] (Tawantinsuyu in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the "Land of the Four Quarters") was the largest and wealthiest empire in the world, and this was depicted in their art. Most Inca sculpture was melted down by the invading Spanish, so most of what remains today is in the form of architecture, textiles, and ceramics. The Inca valued gold among all other metals, and equated it with the sun god [[Inti]]. Some Inca buildings in the capital of [[Cusco]] were literally covered in gold, and most contained many gold and silver sculptures. Most Inca art, however, was abstract in nature. Inca ceramics were primarily large vessels covered in geometric designs. Inca tunics and textiles contained similar motifs, often checkerboard patterns reserved for the Inca elite and the Inca army. Today, due to the unpopularity of abstract art and the lack of Inca gold and silver sculpture, the Inca are best known for the architecture - specifically the complex of [[Machu Picchu]] just northwest of Cusco. Inca architecture makes use of large stone blocks, each one cut specifically to fit around the other blocks in a wall. These stones were cut with such precision that the Incas did not need to make use of mortar to hold their buildings together. Even without mortar, Inca buildings still stand today; they form many of the foundations for even modern-day buildings in Cusco and the surrounding area. The Incas produced thousand of large stone structures, among them forts, temples, and palaces, even though the Inca Empire lasted for only ninety-five years.

'''Primary Care Progress (PCP)''' is a national [[non-profit organization]] advocating for and facilitating the revitalization of [[primary care]] in the United States [[health care]] system. It trains and organizes an interprofessional network of care providers and trainees - doctors, nurses, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, physician assistants and others - and is inspired by what a 2009 report by the Network for Excellence in Health Innovation ([[NEHI]]) described as a crisis in primary care delivery: an increased demand on primary care by older, sicker patients and decreased supply of primary care practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remaking Primary Care: From Crisis to Opportunity|url=http://www.nehi.net/writable/publication_files/file/primary_care_from_crisis_to_opportunity_background_paper.pdf|publisher=Network for Excellence in Health Innovation|date=April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence shows primary care provides better care at lower cost, yet when compared to medical specialty disciplines it is funded less in the United States than any other developed country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A new Center for Primary Care|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/10/hms-launches-center-for-primary-care/|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|date=Oct 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Primary care providers are generally overworked and underpaid compared to specialists, and many are disillusioned. This has resulted in fewer and fewer students choosing primary care training, and many providers retiring early or switching careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A new Center for Primary Care|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/10/hms-launches-center-for-primary-care/|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|date=Oct 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, PCP offers a community for primary care providers, trainees and faculty to connect and support each other. It provides relational [[leadership development]] training and coaching for building health care teams, improving primary care delivery and organizing for change. PCP focuses on students and trainees through its network of over 50 chapters at health professions institutions around the country. Chapters initiatives range from launching student-run free clinics, to changing curriculums, to organizing their local primary care community.

PCP partners with [[Jeffrey Brenner]]’s Camden Coalition of Healthcare Providers and the [[Association of American Medical Colleges]] on the Interprofessional Student Hotspotting Project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student Hotspotting Mini-Grant Project|url=https://www.aamc.org/initiatives/hotspotter/|publisher=Association of American Medical Colleges}}&lt;/ref&gt; an initiative providing teams of health professions students with the knowledge and opportunity to work with high-risk patients to improve their care.

== Media coverage ==
In 2010, PCP president and co-founder Dr. Andrew Morris-Singer discussed on CNN the crisis in primary care and what is being done to address it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primary Care Progress on CNN|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXqe6w9r8Ss|publisher=CNN|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCP’s role in the creation of [[Harvard Medical School]]’s Center for Primary Care - which included a series of town hall meetings with hundreds of attendees - was described in a ''[[Harvard Gazette]]'' article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A new Center for Primary Care|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2010/10/hms-launches-center-for-primary-care/|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|date=Oct 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, PCP was featured in the [[American College of Physicians]]’ IMpact Newsletter as a “new national organization dedicated to engaging local communities to promote primary care, innovate in care delivery and prepare the next generation of leaders in primary care” by “building a grassroots network of advocates who share the vision of a health care system built on a robust foundation of primary care.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Primary Care Progress Engages Trainees in Transformation of Primary Care|url=https://www.acponline.org/medical_students/impact/archives/2011/02/feature/|publisher=American College of Physicians|date=Feb 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, President Morris-Singer wrote a blog post for KevinMD.com calling for a primary care “workforce surge,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It’s time for a primary care workforce surge|url=http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/2012/03/time-primary-care-workforce-surge.html|publisher=KevinMD.com|date=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another for the Health Care Blog on revitalizing the primary care training “pipeline” through a multifaceted approach to overcome the financial, academic, cultural and political challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reviving the Pipeline: A Call to Action For All|url=http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2012/08/11/reviving-the-pipeline-a-call-to-action-for-all/|publisher=The Health Care Blog|date=Aug 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also featured in a ''New York Times'' article on initiatives encouraging students to consider primary care careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luring Students Into Family Medicine|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/us/10iht-educlede10.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all|newspaper=The New York Times|date=Sep 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Representing PCP, in 2013 Dr. Morris-Singer was a panelist for a Congressional briefing on primary care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why We Need Robust Primary Care in the US, and What Congress Can Do to Help|url=http://www.primarycareprogress.org/connect/events/item/14/161|date=March 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCP was also featured in 2013 articles on the primary care crisis by the Associated Press&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newly insured to deepen primary care doctor gap|url=https://news.yahoo.com/newly-insured-deepen-primary-care-doctor-gap-141711587.html|publisher=Associated Press|date=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Association of Health Care Journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Future of primary care: Who will take care of you?|url=http://healthjournalism.org/blog/2013/05/future-of-primary-care-who-will-take-care-of-you/|publisher=Association of Health Care Journalists|date=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, MedPage Today published a piece about Primary Care Progress’ [[grassroots]] efforts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grassroots Group Aims to Renew Primary Care|url=http://www.medpagetoday.com/PrimaryCare/GeneralPrimaryCare/45977|publisher=MedPage Today|date=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Atlantic’s story “Why I’m Becoming a Primary Care Doctor” included insight from President Morris-Singer on the stigmatization of primary care careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why I'm Becoming a Primary-Care Doctor|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/09/why-im-becoming-a-primary-care-doctor/379231/|magazine=The Atlantic|date=Sep 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New England Public Radio highlighted the work of PCP in two 2015 pieces about the future of primary care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Path To Primary Care: Who Will Be The Next Generation Of Frontline Doctors|url=http://nepr.net/news/2014/12/31/the-path-to-primary-care-who-will-be-the-next-generation-of-frontline-doctors//379231/|publisher=New England Public Radio|date=Jan 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raising The Stakes For Primary Care: Advocates Try To Make Field More Attractive|url=http://nepr.net/news/2015/01/23/raising-the-stakes-for-primary-care-advocates-try-to-make-field-more-attractive/|publisher=New England Public Radio|date=Jan 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Psalterium Sinaiticum 2N, fol1r.jpg|thumb|right|Folio 1 recto from the Psalterium]]
The '''Psalterium Sinaiticum''' is a 209-folio [[Glagolitic script|Glagolitic]] [[Old Church Slavonic]] [[Old_Church_Slavonic#The_canon_of_Old_Church_Slavonic|canon]] [[manuscript]], the earliest Slavic [[psalter]], dated to the 11th century. The manuscript was found in [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] in [[Egypt]], after which it was named and where it remains to this day.

== Discovery ==

The major part of the psalter (177 folios) was discovered in 1850 by the Russian [[archimandrite]] [[Porphyrius Uspensky]] ([[#SinSl38|Sin. slav. 38/O]]), and additional 32 folios with the exact continuation (Ps. 138-150 and the 14 canticles) turned up in 1968 (Sin. slav. 2/N).

== Editions ==
It was published by L. Geitler (''Psalterium. Glagolski spomenik manastria Siani brda''; Zagreb 1883), S.N. Severjanov (''Sinajskaja psaltyr'. Glagoličeskij pamjatnik XI veka. Prigotovil k pečati Sergej Sever'janov''; Saint Petersburg 1922, transcribed to [[Cyrillic]]; reprinted in Graz in 1954) and by [[Moshe Altbauer]] in 1971, in a [[facsimile]] reproduction (''Sinajski psaltir, glagolski rakopis od XI. vek od manastirot Sv. Katerina na Sinaj'', MANU, Skopje 1971). The manuscript is also extensively discussed with facsimile reproductions in Ioannis C. Tarnanidis: ''The Slavonic Manuscripts Discovered in 1975 at. St. Catherine's Monastery on Mount Sinai'' (Thessaloniki 1988).

== Linguistic analysis ==
Paleographic and linguistic analysis shows that the writing of some letters is very inconsistent. Therefore, it is assumed that several scribes worked on the manuscript. Especially inconsistent is the writing of [[yer]]s and nasal vowels, and very obvious is the tendency of the vocalization of jers and the omission of epenthetic ''l''.

The '''Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum (RGZM), Leibniz Research Institute for [[Archaeology]],''' is headquartered in [[Mainz]]. It is supported by the [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] and its [[States of Germany|states]] and is a member of the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Scientific Community|Leibniz Association]] of German research institutions.

The institution studies the [[Old World]] and its contact zones from the [[Stone Age]] to the [[Middle Ages]]. It consists of several divisions, and in addition maintains a permanent collection and through this and its numerous publications and conferences, disseminates the findings of recent research to the public.

==History==
The Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum was founded in 1852 by [[Ludwig Lindenschmit the Elder]], after the decision was taken at the 16&amp;ndash;19 August ''Versammlung deutscher Geschichts- und Alterthumsforscher'' (Assembly of German Researchers in History and Classical Studies) in [[Dresden]] that a "central museum for Germanic and Roman artifacts" should be founded in Mainz and a "Germanic museum" should be founded in [[Nuremberg]] (the [[Germanisches Nationalmuseum]]). It was no accident that the museum was established in the city of Mainz, with its high importance in the Middle Ages, and housed in the [[Electoral Palace Mainz|Electoral Palace]]; rather these decisions symbolised the museum's national aspirations in the era of the [[German Confederation]].

In the early years of its existence, the museum faced considerable financial and organisational problems: the support which had been promised by the historical association failed to materialise, and instead the Nuremberg museum was promised exclusivity and the governing board of the Mainz museum were pressured to amalgamate with it. Only after the foundation of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 did the museum receive an annual budget, which also made it possible for Lindenschmit to make his work there his primary pursuit; until then, he had also worked as a drawing teacher. After his death, his son [[Ludwig Lindenschmit the Younger]] took over the leadership.

In 1900, [[Karl Schumacher]] became the first director of the museum, a position which he would hold for 25 years. He increased its size from four to 27 rooms of exhibits, had further copies and reconstructions created in the museum's own workshop and published 297 works under his own name in addition to numerous catalogues, in particular the three-volume ''Siedlungs- und Kulturgeschichte der Rheinlande''.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Schumacher, ''Siedelungs- und Kulturgeschichte der Rheinlande von der Urzeit bis in das Mittelalter'', Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Mainz Handbücher 1&amp;ndash;3, Mainz: Wilckens, 1921&amp;ndash;25, Volume 1 ''Die vorrömische Zeit'', volume 2 ''Die römische Periode'', volume 3 ''Die merowingische und karolingische Zeit''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The elder Lindenschmit conceived of the museum as a research collection of copies, which would include all significant finds made in Germany, or even the whole of Europe, in order to facilitate comparative studies. The museum in Mainz still has the character of a research collection, aimed more at scholars and those interested in the field than at the public in general. In recent years, the museum has also offered "programmes for instructors" and special exhibitions devoted to current research. Although the institution has at times also taken some responsibility for heritage preservation in [[Rhenish Hesse]], including conducting their own excavations, the restoration workshops still constitute today the foundation of their scholarly work, while field investigations are primarily conducted by the annexes in [[Neuwied]] and [[Mayen]].

In early December 2007, the museum announced plans for a new building on the southern edge of Mainz, next to the [[Museum of Ancient Seafaring]] which is one of its annexes.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- http://web.rgzm.de/578.html?&amp;tx_ttnews[backPid]=579&amp;tx_ttnews[pS]=1299504675&amp;tx_ttnews[tt_news]=64&amp;cHash=1dd191a76d55177205e9d5415c193ddb&amp;type=98 ... the [ and ] in this URL make it unlinkable--&gt; "Neubau des RGZM: In Mainz soll ein neues archäologisches Zentrum entstehen", Press release, Rhineland-Palatinate State Ministry of Education, Science, Youth and Culture, 4 December 2007, at News, RGZM.de {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some major German archaeologists have worked and work at the Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum, including Ludwig Lindenschmit the Younger, [[Paul Reinecke]], [[Friedrich Behn]], [[Kurt Böhner]], [[Konrad Weidemann]], [[Markus Egg]] and [[Falko Daim]]. [[Alexandra W. Busch]] has been Director General since October 2018.

==Research emphases==
Researchers from different divisions work together on emphasised themes which cross boundaries between divisions and periods:
* Early hominid expansions and the colonisation of western Eurasia (e.g., excavation of the find of ''[[homo georgicus]]'' at [[Dmanisi]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]])
* Studies on the emergence and development of big-game hunting
* Systems of settlement and internal organisation of settlements in the [[Paleolithic]] and [[Mesolithic]]
* Mediterranean traditions in shipbuilding in Western, Central and Northern Europe
* Forms of Romanisation in the northern border provinces of the [[Roman Empire]], from [[Britannia (Roman province)|Britannia]] to the [[Black Sea]]
* Studies in the structure and genesis of elites in prehistoric and early societies
* Prehistoric and early historical [[hoard]]s
* The development of an industrial landscape
* The ancient quarrying and mining region between the [[Eifel]] and the [[Rhine]]
* Transformation and cultural exchange on the fringes of the Mediterranean world

In presenting research, the museum works closely with the [[Volcano Park, Mayen-Koblenz|Volcano Park]] in [[Mayen-Koblenz]]. One emphasis is research into the use of volcanic rock as building materials and for [[millstone]]s, particularly in the Roman period. Rock from the Eastern Eifel was used to build the Roman settlement of [[Colonia Ulpia Traiana]] at [[Xanten]] and was exported as far as southern Scandinavia.

The museum forms part of the [[Forschungszentrum Erdsystemwissenschaften|Research Centre for Earth System Disciplines]] founded in 2008 at the [[University of Mainz]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.rgzm.de/137.html?&amp;L=0%2529 Arbeitsgruppe ArchaeoScience im Rahmen des vom Land Rheinland-Pfalz geförderten Exzellenzclusters Geo Cycles], RGZM, retrieved 3 May 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of Byzantine Archaeology Mainz, which takes up themes of modern interdisciplinary inquiry into the archaeological evidence on the [[Byzantine Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.rgzm.de/714.html?&amp;L=0%2529 Ständige Kooperation "Byzantinische Archäologie Mainz"], RGZM, retrieved 3 May 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research divisions==
The Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum has several divisions and annexes. The Electoral Palace in Mainz houses three divisions:
* Prehistory
* Roman provincial archaeology
* Early Middle Ages
Several research areas are attached to these divisions.

In the [[Museum of Ancient Seafaring]] in Mainz:
* Research area: ancient seafaring

In Castle Monrepos at [[Neuwied]], the [[Museum of Ice Age Archaeology]]:
* Research area: [[Old Stone Age]]

In [[Mayen]]:
* Research area: [[Volcanology]], Archaeology, History of Technology

The Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum also currently has an extension programme in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.rgzm.de/136.html?&amp;L=0%2529 Außenstelle Xi´an], RGZM, retrieved 3 May 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration workshops===
The work of the Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum is focussed more on artifacts than on conducting field research. This has come to be so because of the museum's rich tradition and important work in restoration workshops; amongst others, they have worked on [[Ötzi the Iceman]]'s equipment and the bronze boar from [[Soulac-sur-Mer]]. They also train restorers, and a [[BA degree]] in museum restoration is offered jointly with the University of Mainz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.rgzm.de/155.html?&amp;L=hhfnpfkzvlxplnr Ausbildung zum Restaurator], RGZM, retrieved 3 May 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of the State of Rhineland-Palatinate, the museum and the university have also jointly set up a centre for mineralogical [[archaeometry]] and conservation studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.rgzm.de/46.html?&amp;L=0%2529 Kompetenzzentrum für Mineralogische Archäometrie und Konservierungsforschung], RGZM, retrieved 3 May 2011 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The museum's history of publications in the field of archaeology goes back to 1852. They publish several scholarly journals, since 2006 in cooperation with Schnell und Steiner in [[Regensburg]]. 

* ''Archäologisches Korrespondenzblatt''
* ''Jahrbuch des RGZM'' (yearbook)
* ''Kataloge Vor- und Frühgeschichtlicher Altertümer'' (catalogues of pre-historic and early antiquities; volume 40 published in 2007;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Zimmermann, ''Die bronze- und früheisenzeitlichen Troiafunde der Sammlung Heinrich Schliemann im Römisch-Germanischen Zentralmuseum'', Kataloge Vor- und Frühgeschichtlicher Altertümer 40, Mainz: Römisch-Germanisches Zentralmuseum Mainz, 2007, {{ISBN|978-3-7954-2007-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; part 2 of volume 30 published in 2009)
* ''[[Corpus Signorum Imperii Romani]]'' (first published 1964)
* ''Tagungen des RGZM'' (symposia)
* Exhibition catalogues
* ''Restaurierung und Archäologie'' (journal, first published 2008)
* Museum guide (first published 2008)

Additionally, they publish scholarly monographs and a recently instituted series for a popular readership.

==Exhibits==

* [[Museum of Ice Age Archaeology]]
* [[Museum of Ancient Seafaring]]
* [[Volcano Park, Mayen-Koblenz]]

The museum in the Electoral Palace has been closed since autumn 2017. The new permanent exhibition is expected to reopen in 2021 in a new building in the southern part of Mainz.

In addition, the museum participates in international exhibitions, but there is rarely space to display these at Mainz.

==Philosophy==
Science Buddies mission is to help students to build their literacy in science and technology so they can become productive and engaged citizens in the 21st century.

The site has personalized learning tools, over 15,000 pages of scientist-developed subject matter (including experiments based on the latest academic research), and an online community of science professionals who volunteer to advise students. 

Science Buddies also provides resources to support parents and teachers as they guide students seeking out and performing science projects. They attempt to provide a bridge between scientists, engineers, educators, and students, giving students access to current scientific research and simultaneously giving scientists a way to reach out to young people interested in their fields.

==About Science Buddies==
Noticing how much fun his teenage daughter had participating in science fairs but dismayed to discover a shortage of quality science fair help online, Ken Hess thought science fair "productivity tools" and mentoring would allow many more students to participate in science fairs and develop inspirational relationships with science role models. Over time, such a program would help students improve their science skills and literacy while inspiring them to consider careers in science and engineering. So, in early 2001, Ken Hess started a charity with a mission of developing online tools and support for students doing science fair projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.slac.stanford.edu/tip/2003/oct03/buddies.htm Stanford University Linear Accelerator Center Interaction Point newsletter]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5235">The '''Society for the Study of Early Christianity''' is a professional association of [[ancient historians]] and [[biblical studies|biblical scholars]], established within the Ancient Cultures Research Centre (ACRC) at [[Macquarie University]]. This assists SSEC in "fulfilling its aims through the study of the [[New Testament]] in its times, including its [[Jewish Christianity|Jewish context]], and the development of [[Early Christianity]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mq.edu.au/about_us/faculties_and_departments/faculty_of_arts/department_of_ancient_history/community_partners/ssec/about_us/ About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327131245/http://www.mq.edu.au/about_us/faculties_and_departments/faculty_of_arts/department_of_ancient_history/community_partners/ssec/about_us/ |date=2012-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and purpose==

The Society was established by the Vice-Chancellor on 8 May 1987, and a Constitution for the Society was approved by the Council of Macquarie University in December 1987. The society has no ecclesiastical ties, however it collaborates on academic occasions with [[Christian theology|Christian]] and [[Jewish theology]] colleges and communities. The current president is [[Alanna Nobbs]]. The society circulates three newsletters a year outlining their activities.

The society lists its aims as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mq.edu.au/about_us/faculties_and_departments/faculty_of_arts/department_of_ancient_history/community_partners/ssec/about_us/ About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327131245/http://www.mq.edu.au/about_us/faculties_and_departments/faculty_of_arts/department_of_ancient_history/community_partners/ssec/about_us/ |date=2012-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To encourage the study of the [[New Testament]] in its times and related topics.
* To build up resources for this study (for example, books, papyri, coins).
* To organise conferences, public lectures, seminars and other activities to which the Society's members are invited.
* To circulate three newsletters a year outlining forthcoming activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8215">The '''South Coast Air Quality Management District''', also using the [[acronym]] '''SCAQMD''', formed in 1976, is the [[Air pollution#Air quality agencies|air pollution agency]] responsible for regulating [[Air pollution dispersion terminology|stationary sources]] of [[air pollution]] in the [[South Coast Air Basin]], in [[Southern California]]. The separate [[California Air Resources Board]] is responsible for regulating mobile sources (e.g. vehicles) in the [[air basin]].

==Basin geography==
The SCAQMD includes all of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]]; and the non-desert regions of [[Los Angeles]] and [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]], and [[Riverside County, California|Riverside County]].

The [[South Coast Air Basin]] area encompassed by the SCAQMD amounts to about 10,750 square miles (27,850 square kilometres) and is the second most populated area in the [[United States]]. This area has a severe problem with [[smog]], and the SCAQMD has been a leader in the nation's efforts to reduce [[Air pollution|air pollution emission]]s. The main office of the SCAQMD is located in the city of [[Diamond Bar, California|Diamond Bar]].

==Operations==
The SCAQMD develops, adopts and implements an Air Quality Management Plan for bringing the area into compliance with the clean air standards established by national and state governmental legislation.

Air quality and permissible air pollutant emission "rules" are promulgated to reduce emissions from various sources, including specific types of equipment, industrial processes, paints, solvents and certain consumer products. Permits are issued to the pertinent industries and businesses to enforce compliance with the air quality and emission rules, and SCAQMD staff conducts periodic inspections to ensure such compliance.

The SCAQMD's rules apply to businesses ranging from large [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]] and [[power plant]]s to [[Filling station|gasoline (petrol) fueling stations]] and [[dry cleaning]] plants. There are about 30,000 such businesses operating under SCAQMD permits. In general, the SCAQMD is limited to establishing rules for regulating stationary sources. [[Emission standards]] for mobile sources (automobiles, trucks, buses, railroads, airplanes and marine vessels) are established by the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[California Air Resources Board]].

===Air quality monitoring network===
The SCAQMD also operates an extensive network of air quality monitoring stations (about 40 stations) and issues daily air quality forecasts. The forecasts are made available to the public through newspapers, television, radio, faxed messages to schools, the SCAQMD's internet website, and a toll-free Smog Update telephone line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aqmd.gov/map/MapAQMD2.pdf SCAQMD Air Quality Monitoring and Forecast Map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927062233/http://www.aqmd.gov/map/MapAQMD2.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calepa.ca.gov/childhealth/news/WorkshopApril04/JCassmassi.pdf ''Monitoring, AQI, Standards &amp; Notification, The South Coast Perspective''] Joe Cassmassi, Senior Meteorologist, SCAQMD, April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air quality and air pollution dispersion modeling===
The air quality modeling activities of the SCAQMD are one of the functions of the Planning, Rule Development and Area Sources section. That section is also responsible for oversight and commenting upon [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|air pollution dispersion modeling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, M.R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; studies performed as part of any environmental impact studies that may be reviewed by or requested by the SCAQMD. The models that may be utilized include:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aqmd.gov/ceqa/models.html Air Quality Modeling]&lt;/ref&gt;

*California Line Source Dispersion Model ([[List of atmospheric dispersion models#U.S. Environmental Protection Agency models|CALINE-4]])
*[[AERMOD]] Model
*Hotspots Analysis and Reporting Program (HARP)
*[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA)'s Air Quality Models
*[[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB)'s Air Quality Models

==Governing board==
The SCAQMD has a ''Governing Board'' of 12 members. Nine of the members are county supervisors and city council members. The remaining three are appointed by California state officials. 

The representative for Orange County cities is chosen by the 34 members of the Orange County City Selection Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/meeting-645912-county-committee.html|title=Cities violated open-meeting laws, county charges|last=Sforza|first=Teri|date=December 22, 2014|website=|publisher=Orange County Register|language=en-US|access-date=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appointment requires both a majority vote of the committee and a majority vote when weighted by population.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voiceofoc.org/2015/11/republicans-succeed-in-kicking-santa-ana-mayor-off-air-quality-board/|title=Republicans Succeed in Kicking Santa Ana Mayor Off Air Quality Board|last=Gerda|first=Nick|date=November 6, 2015|website=|publisher=Voice of OC|access-date=September 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, Republicans blocked reappointment of [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]] Mayor [[Miguel A. Pulido|Miguel Pulido]], a Democrat, to the board, voting to replace him with Republican [[Lake Forest, California|Lake Forest]] Councilman Dwight Robinson.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Administration ==
The chief ''Executive Officer'' of the SCAQMD reports to the Governing Board. The following departments report to the Executive Officer:

===Administrative departments===
* Policy advisor
* Legal
** Counsel
** Prosecutor
* Public Affairs
* Media Relations
* Finance
* Human Resources
* Information Management

===Operational departments===
* Engineering and Compliance
* Planning, Rule Development and Area Sources
*Science and Technology advancement

==Funding for the SCAQMD==
The AQMD utilizes a system of evaluation fees, annual operating fees, emission fees, Hearing Board fees, penalties/ settlements and investments that generate around 73% of AQMD’s revenue. The remaining 27% of its revenue is from federal grants, California Air Resources (CARB) subvention funds, and California Clean Air Act Motor Vehicle fees.

The '''Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe''' (SHARE) is a multidisciplinary and cross-national [[Longitudinal study|panel database]] of micro data on health, socio-economic status and social and family networks of more than 120,000 individuals aged 50 or over (more than 297,000 interviews). SHARE covers 27 European countries and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/organisation/dates-facts.html&lt;/ref&gt;

It was founded as a response to the [[European Commission]]'s call to "examine the possibility of establishing, in co-operation with Member States, a European Longitudinal Ageing Survey". SHARE has become a major pillar of the [[European Research Area]], selected as one of the projects to be implemented in the [[European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures]] (ESFRI) in 2006 and was given a new legal status as the first ever [[European Research Infrastructure Consortium]] (SHARE-ERIC) in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/research/infrastructures/?pg=eric-landscape&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/organisation/share-eric.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== About SHARE ==
Founded in 2002, SHARE is coordinated centrally at the [[Max-Planck-Institut für Sozialrecht und Sozialpolitik|Munich Center for the Economics of Aging (MEA), Max-Planck-Institute for Social Law and Social Policy]] by [[Axel Börsch-Supan]]. It is a collaborative effort of more than 150 researchers worldwide organized in multidisciplinary national teams and cross-national working groups. A Scientific Monitoring Board composed of eminent international researchers and a network of advisors help to maintain and improve the project’s high scientific standards.

SHARE is harmonized with its role models and sister studies the U.S. [[Health and Retirement Study]] (HRS) and the [[English Longitudinal Study of Ageing]] (ELSA), and has the advantage of encompassing cross-national variation in public policy, culture and history across a variety of European countries. Its scientific power is based on its panel design that grasps the dynamic character of the ageing process. SHARE’s multi-disciplinary approach delivers a full picture of the ageing process. Procedural guidelines and programs ensure an ex-ante harmonized cross-national design.
Data collected include health variables (e.g. self-reported health, health conditions, physical and cognitive functioning, health behaviour, use of health care facilities), biomarkers (e.g. grip strength, body-mass index, peak flow), psychological variables (e.g. psychological health, well-being, [[life satisfaction]]), economic variables (current work activity, job characteristics, opportunities to work past retirement age, sources and composition of current income, wealth and consumption, housing, education), and social support variables (e.g. assistance within families, transfers of incomes and assets, social networks, volunteer activities).

SHARE data collection is based on [[Computer-assisted personal interviewing|computer-assisted personal interviewing]] (CAPI) complemented by measurements as well as paper-and-pencil questionnaires. The data are available to the entire research community free of charge.

== Summary results ==

=== Economic Situation, Income and Retirement ===
The data collected by SHARE provide a detailed insight into the financial situation of households of elderly Europeans. Among other things, the study shows that not in all European countries incomes are sufficient – therefore, poverty in old age is a serious problem in some countries. Income is considered the least sufficient in the Eastern European countries Poland and Czech Republic, in the Southern European countries Greece, Italy, and Spain as well as Israel. In these countries, more than 50 percent of households report difficulties making ends meet with their income. In contrast, income is considered satisfactory especially in Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Switzerland; there, less than 20 percent of households have problems getting by with their income.

Likewise, patterns of employment and retirement differ significantly between the European countries. The proportion of people with high workloads in the low wage sector is particularly high in Poland and Greece. Accordingly, the proportion of early retirees is above average. In contrast, work quality in regard to the balance between performance and wage is high in the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. These countries also show the lowest percentage of older employees opting for early retirement.

=== Family ===
Availability of kin support largely depends in general on geographic accessibility and social contact. The SHARE data confirm, on the one hand, the existence of longstanding regional patterns of ‘weak’ and ‘strong’ family ties, while, on the other hand, they reveal many similarities across Europe. In all countries – and across all age groups – 85 percent of all parents have at least one child living at a distance of at most 25&amp;nbsp;km. Moreover, the share of parents with less than weekly contacts to a child is equally low (7%) in Sweden and in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/fileadmin/SHARE_Brochure/share_broschuere_web_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

These results provide no evidence to support the notion of a ‘decline’ of parent-child relations in ageing Europe at the beginning of the 21st century.

=== Health ===
SHARE data document a strong relationship between education and health among the older population. This holds not only on the individual level (better educated individuals are healthier than less educated) but also across European nations. Comparing average education and average health levels in SHARE countries reveals that in particular the East European and Mediterranean countries are characterized by low levels of education and health simultaneously. In contrast, populations in Northern European countries and Switzerland are both healthier and better educated than the average.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/fileadmin/SHARE_Brochure/share_broschuere_web_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research with SHARE data ==
As of January 2018, about 7.500 researchers worldwide use SHARE data for their research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/share-publications/user-publications-statistics.html&lt;/ref&gt; Publications based on SHARE data are documented and published online.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/share-publications.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Waves of data collection ==
[[File:SHARE EU Karte.jpg|thumb|Countries participating in Wave 7 of the SHARE study]]
By now, seven waves of data collection have been conducted. Further waves are being planned to take place on a biennial basis.

=== Wave 1 (2004) ===
Eleven European countries have contributed data to the 2004 SHARE baseline study. They constitute a balanced representation of the various regions in Europe, ranging from Scandinavia (Denmark and Sweden) through Central Europe (Austria, France, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands) to the Mediterranean (Spain, Italy and Greece). Israel joined the SHARE framework in late 2004, being the first country in the Middle East to initiate a systematic study of its aging population.
The SHARE main questionnaire consisted of 20 modules on health, socio-economics and social networks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/questionnaires/questionnaire-wave-1.html&lt;/ref&gt; All data were collected by face-to-face, computer-aided personal interviews (CAPI), supplemented by a self-completion paper and pencil questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/waves-overview/wave-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wave 2 (2006-07) ===

Two 'new' EU member states - the Czech Republic and Poland - as well as Ireland joined SHARE in 2006 and participated in the second wave of data collection in 2006-07.
In addition to the main questionnaire an ‘End of Life’ interview was conducted for family members of deceased respondents.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/questionnaires/questionnaire-wave-2.html&lt;/ref&gt; Israel carried out its second wave in 2009-10.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/waves-overview/wave-2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wave 3 / SHARELIFE (2008-09) ===

SHARELIFE is the third wave of data collection for SHARE, which focuses on people's life histories. 30,000 men and women across 13 European countries took part in this round of the survey.
SHARELIFE links individual micro data over the respondents’ entire life with institutional macro data on the welfare state. It thereby allows assessing the full effect of welfare state interventions on the life of the individual. Changes in institutional settings that influence individual decisions are of specific interest to evaluate policies throughout Europe.
The SHARELIFE questionnaire contains all important areas of the respondents’ lives, ranging from partners and children over housing and work history to detailed questions on health and health care.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/questionnaires/questionnaire-wave-3-sharelife.html&lt;/ref&gt; With this variety SHARELIFE constitutes a large interdisciplinary dataset for research in the fields of sociology, economics, gerontology, and demography. 
The SHARELIFE life history data can be linked to the first two waves of SHARE assessing the present living conditions of older Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/waves-overview/wave-3-sharelife.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wave 4 (2010-11) ===

In the fourth wave which started in autumn 2010, Estonia, Hungary, Luxemburg, Portugal and Slovenia joined the SHARE survey. In the other European countries the national samples were enlarged, and a new social network module was added to the main questionnaire.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/questionnaires/questionnaire-wave-4.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the German study, three additional projects including innovative biomarkers (e.g. dried bloodspots), the linkage with the German pension data as well as nonresponse experiments were implemented.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/waves-overview/wave-4.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wave 5 (2013) ===

Data collection for Wave 5 took place in 2013. A total of 15 countries participated in this wave, including, for the first time, Luxemburg. Since March 2015 the data is available for research purposes. Wave 5 included additional questions regarding childhood, material deprivation, social exclusion, and migration, as well as information on computer skills and the use of computers at the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/waves-overview/wave-5.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wave 6 (2015) ===

Wave 6 was conducted in 2015 in 17 countries. One of the most important innovations was the collection of objective health measures by means of “Dried Blood Spot Sampling” (DBSS): In 12 countries, a blood samples were collected in order to determine blood levels which are associated with diseases that primarily occur among older people. These include cardiovascular diseases and diseases that can be triggered by external living conditions and environmental factors, such as diabetes mellitus (type 2). These additional biomarkers are expected to be a useful instrument for comparing the objective health status with the subjective perception of the respondents. Moreover, they should help to explain correlations between health and social status and to demonstrate the course of a disease. Wave 6 furthermore captures longitudinal changes in the social networks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/waves-overview/wave-6.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Wave 7 (2017) ===

In 2017, the main data collection of Wave 7 took place in 28 countries - full coverage of the EU was achieved by including 8 new countries in SHARE: Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Malta and Cyprus. The Wave 7 questionnaire contains a SHARELIFE module for all respondents who did not participate in Wave 3 (first SHARELIFE wave), as well as a standard module for all respondents who already answered a SHARELIFE interview.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.share-project.org/data-documentation/waves-overview/wave-7.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''UKRC''' ('''UK Resource Centre''') is a UK organisation for the provision of advice, services and policy consultation regarding the under-representation of women in science, engineering, technology and the built environment (SET).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theukrc.org/ |title=Welcome to |publisher=The UKRC |date=2010-11-12 |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is funded by the [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] and was launched in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/science/science-and-society/stem-skills/diversity-in-science/women-in-science |title=The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills |publisher=Bis.gov.uk |date=2010-09-17 |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central base is located in [[Bradford]] in the North of England but there are also centres in South East England, South Yorkshire, Scotland and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theukrc.org/about-us |title=About us |publisher=The Ukrc |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129034550/http://www.theukrc.org/about-us |archivedate=2010-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UKRC works to promote gender equality in SET with employers and professional bodies; education institutions; women's organisations and networks; policy institutes; sector skills councils; the government and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raeng.org.uk/about/diversity/ukrc.htm |title=The UK Resource Centre (UKRC) for Women in SET |publisher=Raeng.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes implementing the [[Athena SWAN]] Charter.

In 2011 it took over the leadership of the [[WISE Campaign]] and became UKRC-WISE. In late 2012 it took on the WISE name.

Benhayon also claims that his daughter, Simone, a swimming teacher, is the reincarnation of [[Winston Churchill]].&lt;ref name="The Da Vinci Mode"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PrivateEye"&gt;{{cite news|title=Quacks in the system|date=February 7, 2014|work=[[Private Eye]]|issue=1359|location=UK|pages=33|lay-url=https://archive.fo/249hg/c7fdb1f96c488d5b46c5de2968a8142c7fe3652b.jpg|lay-source=as printed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serge Benhayon devised Universal Medicine's healing practices based on the belief that disease is caused by energetic disharmony resulting from ill choices made in this and previous lifetimes. Benhayon teaches that there are two types of energy: [[prana]] ({{lang-sa2|प्राण}}, {{IAST|prāṇa}}; [[Sanskrit]] for [[Energy (esotericism)|life force]]) and fire.&lt;ref name="The Da Vinci Mode"/&gt; Most forms of established wisdom, knowledge and belief, as well as most music and certain foods are believed to contain prana, which he regards as evil.&lt;ref name="MOprana"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.medicalobserver.com.au/news/concerns-raised-over-prana-treatment|title=Concerns raised over 'prana' treatment|author=.|date=July 30, 2012|work=The Medical Observer|accessdate=February 1, 2015|location=Australia|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prana is to be rejected or cleared to be replaced with "fiery energy" which emanates from the "Atmic womb of God". Universal Medicine healing modalities and products, including teas, herbal elixirs, creams and laminated healing symbol postcards, aim to clear prana.&lt;ref name="The Da Vinci Mode"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt;

Benhayon teaches that people who abuse their authority, such as dictators and corrupt politicians, are reincarnated as children with disabilities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/disabled-jibe-appalling-former-mayor-slams-healer/3564026/|title=Disabled jibe 'appalling': Former mayor slams UM 'healer'|last=Turner|first=Liana|date=November 1, 2018|work=Northern Star|language=en|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claims disabilities such as [[Autism]] and [[Down syndrome]] are karma for past life sins. He has also controversially stated on many occasions that sexual abuse, including that towards children, is karma from past lives and the universe attempting to stop a person from continuing to make non-loving choices.&lt;ref name="TelegraphBullied"/&gt; He also teaches that illness is caused by the [[Spirit possession|possession]] of the body by evil spirits, and is reported to have told a terminally ill patient that an evil spirit had entered her liver and kidneys.&lt;ref name="The Da Vinci Mode"/&gt;

Benhayon teaches that for western secular women "the ultimate rape is rejection".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; On race he writes that skin color evolution was a conscious choice and that Asians chose yellow skin, "yellow signifies the intellect" and the "pursuit of a lighter complexion arose when [[Black skin|Black]] (sic) became erroneously identified with the [[Darkness#Religion|Darkness]] (sic)."&lt;ref name="TelegraphBullied"/&gt; He taught his followers that if their children misspent their inheritance, or if they set conditions on their donations to UM, their "kidney energy" could be harmed in the next life.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-05/universal-medicine-cult-preyed-on-cancer-victim-jury-finds/10381432|title='We've been vindicated': Relief as jury finds 'socially dangerous cult' preyed on cancer victim|last=Robertson|first=Josh|date=November 5, 2018|work=ABC News|publisher=abc.net.au|layurl=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0pa_da3_9Y|lay-source=TV video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics say Universal Medicine places unreasonable pressure on followers to adhere to a severely restricted diet and to avoid most exercise for fear those things might "infect their spiritual alignment" and lead to poor health.&lt;ref name="MOInsideUM" /&gt; After reviewing a diet chart from Universal Medicine, the Professor of Public Health at the University of Wollongong and former president of the Public Health Association of Australia Heather Yeatman said it was “a public health issue” when children were placed on such restrictive diets: “If a child is not having dairy or cereals they are likely to be low in energy intake and there could be the risk of stunting if children are not getting enough energy. It is critically important there is a balanced diet, especially at the weaning stage because it can impact overall growth and cognitive development. It’s a public health issue.” This came after the report of a baby of UM member parents was hospitalised due to diet-related illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/news-story/0bda4d34cca49375f852c4053fe4cc32|title=Court rules Universal Medicine founder is running a ‘harmful cult’|last1=Hansen|first1=Jane|date=October 21, 2018|work=The Sunday Telegraph|publisher=News Corp|subscription=y|lay-url=https://www.cultnews101.com/2018/10/court-rules-universal-medicine-founder.html|lay-source=republished}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benhayon's "esoteric connective tissue therapy" is said to improve the patient's energy flow by "allowing the pulse of the lymphatic system to symbiotically correspond with the body's own ensheathing web". Prof. John Dwyer describes the existence of a lymphatic pulse as "utter nonsense".&lt;ref name="SMH"/&gt; Universal Medicine also provides counselling services to parents, body awareness education workshops to young women&lt;ref name="MOYWCA" /&gt; as well as cardiosacral pulse and craniosacral readings.&lt;ref name="MOInsideUM" /&gt;

In November 2014 Universal Medicine's treatments were highlighted in a [[Parliament of New South Wales|NSW Parliamentary]] Inquiry report by the Health Care Complaints Committee which states:
:"While there is little anecdotal evidence to suggest actual harm caused by these treatments, concerns were raised that patients may forego seeking proper medical advice and care. Two patients who were undergoing therapies at Universal Medicine were independently diagnosed with cancer and bronchiectasis respectively, and required proper medical intervention in order to be properly treated."&lt;ref name="HCCC"/&gt;

Universal Medicine lobbied the local [[Don Page (politician)|NSW MP for Ballina Don Page]] to have these unfavourable comments removed from the Parliamentary Inquiry Report.&lt;ref name="TelegraphBullied" /&gt;

Most books burnt were on [[Chinese medicine]], [[kinesiology]], [[acupuncture]], [[homeopathy]] and other [[alternative healing]] modalities, all of which Benhayon had decreed "prana"&lt;ref name="The Da Vinci Mode" /&gt; which he considers "evil".&lt;ref name="MOprana" /&gt;

Serge Benhayon confirms revenue from Universal Medicine provides a living for the whole of the extended Benhayon family. In 2016, he had a taxable income of more than $188,000, and his wife, Miranda, $176,000. Approximately $50,000 of his income came from the Universal Family Trust, which also distributed $129,593 to his daughter Natalie, approximately $100,000 to his son Michael, $59,812 to his son Curtis and a further $34,890 to Curtis' wife Isabella. A further $400,000 went to another company. Benhayon's ex-wife Deborah Benhayon receives a salary as the chief financial officer for UM.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/discarnate-spirits-in-the-courtroom-as-healer-is-cross-examined-20180905-p501u5.html|title='Discarnate spirits' in the courtroom as 'healer' is cross-examined|last1=Whitbourn|first1=Michaela|date=September 5, 2018|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real estate to the value of $5.5 million has been linked to the group, including a $1.75 million property in Brisbane, and a hall valued at $2.3 million.&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/lawyer-tells-jury-not-to-believe-conman-from-goone/3534608/|title=Lawyer tells jury not to believe 'conman from Goonellabah'|last1=McKeith|first1=Sam|date=September 26, 2018|work=Northern Star|publisher=News Corp|subscription=y|lay-url=https://www.pressreader.com/similar/281659665970587|lay-source=as printed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"The breasts are emanators of a quality of DIVINE TRUTH that begins at the heart.

Benhayon's daughter Simone is one of the Trustees of The Sound Foundation in the UK, a second related charitable organisation that Universal Medicine called one of its "two main world headquarters".&lt;ref name="PrivateEye" /&gt; The Sound Foundation was the subject of a 2013 complaint to the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales|Charity Commission]] for England and Wales which found extensive irregularities and resulted in the charity being given a mandatory compliance plan.&lt;ref name="CharityCommission"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stothart|first=Chloe|url=http://www.thirdsector.co.uk/charity-commission-hands-action-plan-health-charity/governance/article/1222011|title=Charity Commission hands action plan to health charity|work=Third Sector|date=November 25, 2013|location=UK|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304062918/https://www.thirdsector.co.uk/charity-commission-hands-action-plan-health-charity/governance/article/1222011/|archive-date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also attracted attention from a [[National Health Service]] Forum who distanced itself from the group.&lt;ref name="Private_Eye_1361"&gt;{{cite news|title=Good news corner|date=March 7, 2014|work=[[Private Eye]]|issue=1361|location=UK|pages=32|lay-url=https://archive.fo/EgHFG/9048f56a6c8bf83690f6a3fbd40d70c9d197793d|lay-source=as printed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benhayon is the father of four children, all who hold positions within the organisation.

Universal Medicine is reported to have received a portion of AUD$709,493 federal funds to provide six public lectures and "counselling services to parents" under a Commonwealth grant scheme applied for by the [[YWCA]]. The Australian Government refused to fully release documents explaining how the funds were used, saying "YWCA raised objections… including that the information does not accurately reflect YWCA’s activities" and could "have an adverse effect on the YWCA by affecting its relationships with other entities and its reputation".&lt;ref name="MOYWCA"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaye|first=Byron|url=http://www.medicalobserver.com.au/news/government-blocks-ywca-documents|title=Government blocks YWCA documents|work=The Medical Observer|date=November 27, 2012|location=Australia|accessdate=January 11, 2015|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, twenty Universal Medicine adherents joined the Australian doctor's reform lobby group, the HPARA, en-mass causing turmoil and a split in the organisation. HPARA chair Dr John Stokes said the UM adherents, who "initially ... all seemed quite impressive and normal," unexpectedly began turning up to meetings and attempted to take over the organisation's social media accounts and board of directors without declaring their UM connections. "Some of them behaved in ways that made me feel quite uncomfortable, where they would come into my personal space," he recalled. Dr Stokes said there were concerns of reprisals and potential legal threats from the UM group, and that he and others expressed concern at HPARA being associated with the cult, but is now confident that no member with links to UM remains in the HPARA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/ahpra-lobby-group-distances-itself-universal-medicine|title=AHPRA lobby group distances itself from Universal Medicine|last=O'Rourke|first=Geir|last2=Smith|first2=Paul|date=October 24, 2018|website=Australian Doctor|publication-place=Sydney NSW|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation by [[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] in April 2018 revealed that [[The University of Queensland]] was investigating conflicts of interest of three of its faculty who were "acolytes" advocating for Universal Medicine. Video allegedly shows four researchers, two of whom are doctors, publicly advocating UM practices. Two more of the nine are presenters for the College of Universal Medicine. [[John Dwyer (medicine)|Professor John Dywer]] stated that: "[They] have let the university down badly in their fervour for promoting the benefits of Universal Medicine's approach to treatments, which have no basis in science, couldn't possibly be effective, and really represent a pre-scientific approach to how the body works and interacts with God and the universe". After receiving a 12-page letter from a third party whistleblower ''The [[Journal of Medical Internet Research]]'' (JMIR) raised "serious concerns" as to the conflict of interest of the authors of the UM related articles it published. The editorial director stated that: "the omission of this conflict of interest, which appears to be highly significant in this case, is a clear violation of our policies"&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/international/uq-researchers-accused-of-promoting-dangerous-cult/9663184|title='Cult' Universal medicine practices promoted by researchers, UQ launches investigation|last=Robertson|first=Josh|date=April 16, 2018|work=ABC News|access-date=May 3, 2018|publisher=abc.net.au|layurl=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCgY9voDJqM|lay-source=TV video}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.doctorportal.com.au/mjainsight/2018/16/the-researchers-the-university-and-the-bizarre-medical-cult/|title=The researchers, the university and the bizarre medical cult|last=Wilcken|first=Hugo|date=April 30, 2018|website=MJA InSight 16|publisher=AMPCo (Australian Medical Association)|language=en|access-date=May 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested both articles published in the JMIR should be retracted. JMIR was also "very concerned" when it was revealed that the "original results paper contained large statistical errors inflating the effect sizes" and concluded "the proposed and executed research does not provide any evidence that any Universal Medicine modalities are effective in making people healthier". When the original peer-reviewers of the papers were made aware of the extensive conflicts of interest, they stated they would not have accepted the manuscripts had they been aware of this fact upon submission.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=JMIR Editorial Office|date=May 11, 2018|title=Expression of Editorial Concern, Correction of Conflict of Interest and Affiliation, and Data Corrections|url=http://publichealth.jmir.org/2018/2/e53/|journal=JMIR Public Health and Surveillance|language=en|volume=4|issue=2|pages=e53|doi=10.2196/publichealth.9932|issn=2369-2960|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018 Universal Medicine was compelled to cancel all their event and hire bookings with [[Ballina Shire Council]], including the Girl to Woman Festival, only days prior to the festival being debated in council chambers. UM took this action after 1,000 people had signed a petition to have the Girl to Woman event barred from [[Lennox Head]] Cultural Centre, and also to avoid becoming embroiled in a council policy motion that adopted child protection measures for future events and hiring "where the Council believes that provision of the service would pose a potential for child abuse". Council's amended policies concerning hiring and the tightening of child protection measures (not mentioning UM or the girl festival) were adopted, but not before UM had publicly criticised council's actions and long-term UM student and advocate Rebecca Asquith (Baldwin)&lt;ref name=":26" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; appeared at the council meeting on behalf of the festival urging councillors to oppose the motion.&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.echo.net.au/2018/11/universal-medicine-cancels-event-bookings/|title=Universal Medicine cancels all event bookings|last=Shand|first=Asland|date=November 30, 2018|work=Echonetdaily|location=Byron bay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/council-adopts-child-protection-measures-for-event/3582731/|title=Council adopts child protection measures for events|last=Turner|first=Liana|date=November 22, 2018|work=Northern Star|subscription=y|lay-url=https://www.pressreader.com/australia/the-northern-star/20181123/281522227134747|lay-source=as printed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to this, NSW Minister for Health, [[Brad Hazzard]], issued a directive for NSW Health to halt all dealings with Universal Medicine after UM-linked individuals and businesses were found to be involved in the annual Positive Adolescent Sexual Health (PASH) conference. The youth health initiative is backed by the [[NSW Department of Health]] and aimed at teens aged 15 years and up. Northern NSW Local Health District chief executive Wayne Jones said that UM members would be removed from the project and NSW Health would: "immediately review engagement and risks of health service involvement with Universal Medicine and discontinue any further association".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/um-dealings-halted-by-ministers-directive/3588549/|title=UM dealings halted by minister's directive|last1=Turner|first1=Liana|date=November 28, 2018|work=The Northern Star|access-date=|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/state-politics/cult-members-told-by-minister-to-leave-sexual-health-conference/news-story/1a9ae19e696254730e7b77efd4a52d31|title=‘Cult’ members told by minister to leave sexual health conference|last=Morton|first=Rick|date=November 28, 2018|website=The Australian|publisher=News Corp|archive-url=http://archive.is/kRrPk|archive-date=November 28, 2018|dead-url=y|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Electoral district of Lismore|Lismore]] MP [[Thomas George (Australian politician)|Thomas George]] ([[National Party of Australia|Nationals]]) and [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]] candidates for Lismore and [[Electoral district of Ballina|Ballina]], [[Janelle Saffin]] and Asren Pugh, supported the directive by the Health Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/um-affiliates-step-down-as-minister-calls-for-revi/3589564/|title=UM affiliates step down as minister calls for review|last=Turner|first=Liana|date=November 29, 2018|work=Northern Star|subscription=y|lay-url=http://www.pressreader.com/similar/281655371135910|lay-source=as printed}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days earlier Ms Saffin and ALP candidate for [[Division of Page|Page]] Patrick Deegan had called for an inquiry into UM to ensure that no government resources go toward any organisation regarded as a 'cult', and that government departments and agencies do not endorse, encourage or support the involvement of children and young people in any such organisation. Ms Saffin said: "An inquiry [into UM] would be opportunity to clear the air and to restore faith in our local institutions".

== Australian medical authorities and Dr Samuel Kim ==

Following an investigation by the NSW Medical Council in 2017 a Universal Medicine advocate and affiliated doctor, Samuel Tae-Kyu Kim was reprimanded for referring a patient for esoteric lung massage and chakra puncture:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/doctor-found-guilty-over-referrals/3184226/|title=Doctor found guilty over referrals|last=Adams|first=Cathy|date=May 31, 2017|work=Northern Star|accessdate=June 1, 2017|publisher=News Corp|location=Lismore NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt; "knowing there was insufficient evidence for their efficacy as treatments for Patient A’s lung condition." The physician, whose clinic is located in the Universal Medicine Clinic in Goonellabah,&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.echo.net.au/2017/05/universal-medicine-affiliated-doctor-reprimanded/|title=Universal Medicine affiliated doctor reprimanded|last1=Dobney|first1=Chris|date=May 30, 2017|work=Echonetdaily|accessdate=June 1, 2017|location=Byron Bay NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed chakra puncture is an "internationally recognized therapy", however only practiced by Universal Medicine. The Council heard evidence from a Senior Specialst and thoracic physician, who stated:
:Universal Medicine "affects an attitude which conventional medicine abandoned in the 19th century and this heightens the need to clearly distinguish for patients the difference between conventional medicine and Universal Medicine. Particularly as it is unclear, given it is a relatively new organisation, how Universal Medicine’s training programs are accredited."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The HCCC alleged Dr Samuel Kim had withheld conventional therapy&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hccc.nsw.gov.au/Publications/Media-releases/2017/Dr-Samuel-Tae-Kyu-Kim---Unsatisfactory-professional-conduct|title=Dr Samuel Tae-Kyu Kim – Unsatisfactory professional conduct|last=HCCC|first=|date=May 9, 2017|website=HCCC|archive-date=July 28, 2017|dead-url=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728035528/http://www.hccc.nsw.gov.au/Publications/Media-releases/2017/Dr-Samuel-Tae-Kyu-Kim---Unsatisfactory-professional-conduct}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the investigation focussed on his referrals to his now wife Jasna Jugovic (esoteric lung massage) and three "Universal Medicine practitioners" Neil Ringe (chakra puncture), Serge Benhayon (spiritual healing) and Michael Serafin (non-medically trained pharmacist).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/may/31/doctor-rebuked-over-spiritual-healing-group-touting-esoteric-breast-massage|title=Doctor rebuked over 'spiritual healing' group touting 'esoteric breast massage'|last=Robertson|first=Joshua|date=May 31, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=|accessdate=June 1, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigating committee found Kim to lack contrition, and at times to be an unreliable witness and his evidence to be contradictory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Following the enquiry, the [[Health Care Complaints Commission|HCCC]] found 5 out of 6 allegations against Dr Kim proven, him "guilty of unsatisfactory professional conduct" (which he admits to), and concluded by placing permanent restrictions upon his practice.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hccc.nsw.gov.au/ArticleDocuments/250/Decision%20-%20KIM%20Samuel%20Tae-Kyu%20-%20PSC%20-%208%20May%202017.pdf.aspx|title=PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS COMMITTEE INQUIRY.

Dr Kim stood down from the [[Australian Medical Association]] Queensland council in May 2018 after ABC News investigated a second case of professional misconduct where he had shared the entire medical and medication records of a patient with Serge Benhayon without the patient's knowledge. The patient had criticised Universal Medicine in the media and Kim claims he obtained the patient’s verbal consent. The NSW Privacy Commissioner disagreed and found Dr Kim had breached Health Privacy Principles,&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thelimbic.com/respiratory/thoracic-physician-stands-down-in-dispute-over-links-to-esoteric-group/|title=Thoracic physician stands down in dispute over ‘esoteric’ group|last=Hoffman|first=Tessa|date=May 3, 2018|work=The Limbic|access-date=May 4, 2018|publisher=thelimbic.com|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; violated the patients privacy and its report said it was "unclear ... why it was necessary for Dr Kim to provide such a summary of what appears to be Mr Martin's entire medical history to Mr Benhayon".

== Legal Issues ==
In December 2015 Benhayon appeared at the [[Supreme Court of NSW]] when his sizeable inheritance from the estate of devotee Judith McIntyre was challenged by her children. The breast cancer victim's estate was estimated to be worth $1.1 million, $600,000 of which was intended for Serge Benhayon. A further gift of $800,000 was given to Benhayon by McIntyre three days after executing her will. Justice James Stevenson declined to alter the distribution of the estate and issued a ruling stating that Ms McIntyre "appears to have carefully considered how she should dispose of her estate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/cancer-victims-children-lose-appeal-to-overturn-will-which-bequeathed-majority-of-11m-estate-to-healer/news-story/ebe4db1a431eec20a02844a35d6b9e9d|title=Cancer victim’s children lose appeal to overturn will which bequeathed majority of $1.1m estate to healer|last1=Dale|first1=Amy|date=December 29, 2015|accessdate=February 1, 2017|publisher=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3376253/Children-woman-died-breast-cancer-left-majority-1-1million-estate-health-guru-fail-legal-bid-challenge-will.html|title=Court rejects bid by the two children of a woman who died of breast cancer to get a share of the million-dollar estate she left to a 'health guru' whose followers call him the 'new Messiah'|last1=Noble|first1=Freya|date=December 29, 2015|accessdate=February 1, 2017|publisher=The Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to her death, UM followers had established themselves as Ms McIntyre's nurse, financial planner, the witness to her will, the lawyer who drafted it and its executor.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; In a later unrelated trial, a NSW Supreme Court jury found it was substantially true to say that Benhayon "preys on", "swindles" and "exploits cancer patients by targeting them to leave him bequests in their wills"&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/revealed-what-the-jury-said-about-socially-harmful/3553783/|title=REVEALED: What the jury said about 'socially harmful cult'|last=Turner|first=Liana|date=October 19, 2018|work=Northern Star|publisher=News Corp|subscription=y|lay-url=https://www.pressreader.com/similar/281724090530042|lay-source=as printed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; and that he exercised "undue influence" on Ms McIntyre to inherit the bulk of her million-dollar estate.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; 

Emails released by Ms McIntyre’s daughter, Sarah, that were written by Benhayon to her mother during the last few months of her life, claimed that her children were “trying to destabilise you, trying to evoke your sympathy", which was "an attack on the funds that will help The Hierarchy's work on Earth". Benhayon also warned her against publicly revealing donations because evil spirits known as "the Dark Lodge" could "cause serious harm" to donors.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

In June 2018 Justice McCallum, of the Supreme Court of NSW, ordered Benhayon to produce photographs and videos of workshops or sessions that relate to the technique of “Deeper Femaleness” which display the “hands on” healing technique practiced by Universal Medicine. He was also ordered to produce a list of donations received, tax returns and other financial statements. The ruling comes as part of an ongoing defamation trial in which Benhayon is suing a blogger, Esther Rockett, for defamation.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://lawyerly.com.au/judge-orders-spiritual-guru-produce-pics-hands-healing/|title=Judge orders spiritual guru to produce pics of ‘hands on’ healing|last=Fredenburgh|first=Cat|date=June 21, 2018|work=Lawyerly|access-date=June 23, 2018|publisher=Lawyerly Media|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/spiritual-healer-serge-benhayon-gave-client-ovarian-reading-20180624-p4znf9.html|title=Spiritual healer Serge Benhayon gave client 'ovarian reading'|last=McClymont|first=Kate|date=June 24, 2018|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=June 25, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Benhayon sued a blogger, Esther Rockett, for defamation in the Supreme Court of NSW over social media posts she had made which he said portray him as: delusional, dishonest, a sexual predator and the leader of a "socially harmful cult". Rockett described Benhayon as a “sleazebag guru” and accused him of performing a "sleazy ovarian reading" on her during a treatment session, inappropriately touching her, and engaging in inappropriate conduct towards women. Rockett argued the defences of truth and honest opinion in connection to her social media postings.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/spiritual-healer-serge-benhayon-not-a-cult-leader-court-20180904-p501mh.html|title=Spiritual healer Serge Benhayon 'not a cult leader': court|last1=Whitbourn|first1=Michaela|date=September 4, 2018|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/self-styled-healer-serge-benhayon-leads-socially-harmful-cult-jury-20181010-p508ux.html|title=Self-styled healer Serge Benhayon leads 'socially harmful cult': jury|last1=Whitbourn|first1=Michaela|date=October 15, 2018|work=Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 7 week trial, which began in September 2018, Benhayon described himself as a "teacher and practitioner" and also a "business owner". He said his teachings, which are offered as courses, were derived "from the tradition known as the ageless wisdom". He claimed the ageless wisdom had a "very strong lineage that includes the divine messengers", including Hermes, Plato, Pythagorasm, Jesus and Muhammad. He told the court that he "had an understanding", which was stronger than a belief, that in one of his many past lives he was Leonardo da Vinci&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; and Pythagoras&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;. Benhayon told Ms Rockett's barrister, Mr Molomby QC, that he could sense discarnate spirits in the courtroom who were nine feet tall, had no feet, and a "crevasse" where the nose was meant to be. He declined to count them and denied this was because he couldn't really feel their presence, saying "I could [count] if I wanted to but it's not something I practise and it's not something I'm allowed to do".&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/lanesainty/serge-benhayon-defamation-spirits-in-the-courtroom|title=This Faith Healer Suing For Defamation Says He's The Reincarnation Of Leonardo Da Vinci|last1=Sainty|first1=Lane|date=September 5, 2018|work=Buzzfeed News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Under cross-examination, Benhayon also stated that people who abused their authority, such as dictators and corrupt politicians, are reincarnated as disabled children. He agreed that during a Sacred Esoteric Healing course - level 1, that he had said that the Roman emperor Nero continues to reincarnate as an autistic child, while other authority abusers reincarnate as children with Down syndrome or other disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theherald.com.au/story/5630505/reincarnation-evidence-given-by-nsw-healer/|title=Reincarnation evidence given by NSW healer|last1=Scheikowski|first1=Margaret|date=September 6, 2018|work=Newcastle Herald|publisher=Australian Community Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four-person jury completed answers to 58 pages of questions, primarily in Ms Rockett's favour and against Mr Benhayon. They found it was substantially true to say he led a "socially harmful cult", made "bogus healing claims", "intentionally indecently touched" clients, and as Ms Rockett claimed, that there were "reasonable grounds to believe" Mr Benhayon intentionally sexually preyed upon her and other clients during treatment sessions. It was also found substantially true to say Mr Benhayon was the leader of Universal Medicine, "a group which to his knowledge makes false claims about healing that causes harm to others", that he had an "indecent interest in young girls as young as ten whom he causes to stay at his house unaccompanied",&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; "is guilty of inappropriate behaviour with children",&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; "is dishonest", "is sexually manipulative of his cult followers", and "has persuaded followers to shun loved ones who won’t join his cult".&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.australiandoctor.com.au/news/jury-declares-universal-medicine-leader-exploitative-charlatan|title=Jury declares Universal Medicine leader an exploitative charlatan|last=Smith|first=Paul|last2=Wright|first2=Jocelyn|date=October 16, 2018|website=Australian Doctor|subscription=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other substantial truth findings by the jury were that he "vilifies people with disabilities", "exploited children by having them vouch for UM's dishonest healing practices",&lt;ref name="Byron_Echo" /&gt; "engages in bizarre sexual manipulation to make money for his business", "exploits cancer patients by targeting them to leave him bequests in their wills",&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.northernstar.com.au/news/defamation-loss-for-universal-medicine-founder/3550048/|title=Spiritual healer 'leader of socially harmful cult': Jury|last=AAP|date=October 15, 2018|work=Northern Star|publisher=News Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/latest-news/defamation-loss-for-nsw-spiritual-healer/news-story/ac8ef1934de9f0b26f474d27a2738b10?nk=a1e1a4580aa332c2cb6193e38afdfebd-1539593422|title=Defamation loss for NSW spiritual healer|last1=Scheikowski|first1=Margaret|date=October 15, 2018|work=The Australian|publisher=News Corp Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; "dishonestly promotes fraudulent ideas of karma for self-gain", "denigrates life and glorifies death"&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; and "is a hypocrite because his Esoteric Healing has death as its goal."&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; The ''Northern Star'' also reported further substantial truth findings that "Serge Benhayon is the leader of a socially harmful cult that is paternalistic to women", "engages in inappropriate conduct towards women", "instructed students at Universal Medicine training workshops to touch the genitals of victims of sexual assault", "has engaged in bullying to stop Esther Rockett exposing that he is guilty of inappropriate behaviour with children" and "is not a fit person to hold a Working with Children Certificate".&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt;

The jury found allegations that Benhayon was "delusional",&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; had "a propensity to touch girls inappropriately", "groped the genitals of various women under the guise of treating them" or "instilled fear and guilt in children to get them to do his bidding"&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; were not substantially true or upheld, instead they were covered by Rockett's qualified privilege.&lt;ref name="Serge_Activity" /&gt; Serge Benhayon has denied all allegations of wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

== Other privacy and confidentiality issues ==

An ex-patient and [[Health Care Complaints Commission|HCCC]] complainant,&lt;ref name="DailyTelegraph"/&gt; who was vilified on Universal Medicine websites said the organisation accuses "everyone else of [[cyberbullying]] while embarking on a systematic, online pack hunt". Numerous students of the organisation unknown to the complainant have openly disputed her medical conditions online. Benhayon has defended the group’s right to do so.&lt;ref name="TelegraphBullied"/&gt;

The former Queensland mental health commissioner was scathing of Universal Medicine after the UM "Facts Team" breached privacy and published an ex-UM client's full name, image and schizophrenia diagnosis online after he criticised them. Prior to the outing in 2018 the man had been anonymous. The former commissioner Lesley van Schoubroeck said:
:it is "entirely inappropriate for any organisation, particularly one purporting to be a health organisation, to publicly reveal identifying information of anyone's diagnosis, be it mental health or physical health" and "people with schizophrenia suffer stigma and discrimination in the workplace and in the community".&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
When interviewed by the ABC the ex-client expressed concern about his future job prospects due to the privacy breach.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

It started in 2006 as part of the [[European Commission]]'s [[Erasmus Mundus]] programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/education/programmes/mundus/index_en.html EUROPA - Education and Training - Erasmus Mundus&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
VIBOT is a two-year Master Program in [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] [[Visual perception|Vision]] and [[Robotics]] accredited in 2006 by the European Commission in the framework of the Erasmus Mundus program, a co-operation and mobility program of the [[European Commission]] in the field of higher education in order to promote the [[European Union]] as a centre of excellence in learning around the [[world]]. It is the only Erasmus Mundus Master Program in 3D Vision and Robotics among the 103 Erasmus Mundus Master Programs accredited since 2004 in all disciplines.

VIBOT Master students have courses in the three collaborating universities: [[Université de Bourgogne]] in France, [[University of Girona]] in [[Spain]] and Heriot-Watt University in Scotland. They spend one [[semester]] in each of these three universities and the fourth semester in training. The admission of the brightest students from all over the world, some of whom were already working in companies, allows to create an [[international]] and mobile educated workforce of high level for the [[European community]].

VIBOT Master courses are given by faculties and visiting [[professors]] who belong to well-known [[research]] [[laboratories]] that have long-standing reputation for high quality research. The courses start from a comprehensive coverage of the prerequisites in the field of [[digital imaging]] ([[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]]) and basic [[image processing]] algorithms, and end up with research level teaching of their applications in the fields of [[robotics]], [[medical imaging]] and 3D vision systems. The close location of research laboratories on campus allows the faculties to involve students at all stages of research and offer them many opportunities to participate in state-of-the-art research work.

== Course Structure ==
The Masters Course is divided in four semesters, each having a value of 30 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]. All the courses are taught in English in the three partner universities. However, the order in which the students attend the universities has changed from the first generation to the second generation of the program. Irrespective of the generation, the last semester consists of a training period, which is an introduction to research carried out in one of the laboratories of the (wider) network.

=== First Generation ===

The so-called VIBOT first generation comprises the first five promotions of the program (promotions starting from 2006 to 2010). For this primer generation, the mobility order was the following: Scotland, Spain, France.

The first semester was carried out on the campus of [[Heriot Watt University]] in [[Scotland]] ([[UK]]). Its constituting modules covered an introduction to [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] and [[image processing]], as well as the key related area of [[artificial intelligence]]. These subjects were supplemented by local culture studies, and training for drafting documents in [[English language|English]].

The second semester took place in the [[Universitat de Girona]], in [[Catalunya]], [[Spain]]. Topics were currently highly relevant to scientific and industrial communities like the [[Segmentation (image processing)|segmentation]] strategies, [[object recognition]] and description, the acquisition of 3D information, and the application of hardware for specific real time applications.  This semester covered: fundamentals on [[robotics]], [[autonomous robots]], scene segmentation and interpretation, [[visual perception]], [[Real-time computer graphics|real time]] [[image processing]] and study of the local culture.

The third semester was hosted by the university Center Condorcet in [[Le Creusot]], which is a delocalization of the [[Université de Bourgogne]]. The subjects covered were: [[pattern recognition]], [[image analysis]] (including the problems of multiresolution analysis and deconvolution). These modules were supplemented by the study of various types of image modalities such as: [[infra-red]], [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]], radio-isotopique and [[X-ray]] imagery, with an emphasis on their application to medical imagery. A module of local culture was also provided.

=== Second Generation ===

The VIBOT second generation starts in 2011 with the sixth promotion and is expected to last at least for five promotions. The main changes consist in the mobility order. Unlike the first generation, the second generation spends the semesters in the following order: France, Spain, Scotland. The overall objective is to start from science fundamentals and low-level image processing, then to introduce mid-level image processing, computer vision and applications in medical imaging, and to end with robotics and high-level integration so that the main methods and algorithms in the state-of-art of computer vision and robotics (through both a theoretical and applied point of view) are covered.

The organization of the semesters is as follows. An induction week is organized starting the first semester, in September, in [[Le Creusot]] during which the enrolled students are informed about the program, the assessment and the rules. The induction week also permits new students to meet second-year students or former VIBOT students. The first semester is held at [[University of Burgundy|Universite de Bougogne]] (UB) where the modules of Fundamentals on [[image processing]], sensors and acquisition, as well as mathematics and computer science are taught. The second semester is hosted at [[Universitat de Girona]] (UdG) with subjects as improvements on [[image processing]] and [[pattern recognition]], complements on [[computer vision]] and [[medical imaging]] and an introduction to [[robotics]]. The third semester is developed at [[Heriot-Watt University]] (HWU), and more advanced courses related to methods and high-level processing for real-time implementation and integration of vision and robotics are taught.

=== Training Period ===

The training period in research corresponds to the fourth semester of the course. The laboratories belonging to the consortium of universities are the laboratories where the students are initially expected to do the training period. These laboratories are: Vision, Image and Signal Processing ([http://visp.eps.hw.ac.uk/ VISP]) and Ocean Systems Laboratory ([http://osl.eps.hw.ac.uk/ OSL]) in Heriot-Watt University, the laboratory for Computer Vision and Robotics ([http://vicorob.udg.es/ VICOROB]) at the Universitat de Girona, and the Laboratory of Electronics, Informatics and Image ([http://le2i.cnrs.fr/ Le2i]) in Le Creusot.
However, the training period can also take place in any validated host laboratory or research center throughout the [[world]]. The laboratories concerned belong to the worldwide research networks which the participating institutes have jointly developed through the international-class research activities of their laboratories. Some of the laboratories where some previous students have done their research fourth semester are: Honda Research Institute Europe GmbH (Offenbach am Main, Germany),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honda Research Institute Europe|url=http://www.honda-ri.org/intern/Welcome_to_HRI-EU/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erasmus University Rotterdam (Rotterdam, Netherlands),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biomedical Imaging Group Rotterdam|url=http://www.bigr.nl/website/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laboratory for Analysis and Architecture of Systems LAAS-CNRS (Toulouse, France),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LAAS - Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Group|url=http://www.laas.fr/2-29949-RIA.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; the French National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control INRIA (Grenoble, France),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lear Group - INRIA|url=http://lear.inrialpes.fr/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toshiba Medical Visualization Systems Europe (Edinburgh, UK),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Toshiba Medical Visualization Systems Europe|url=http://www.tmvse.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information and Communication Technologies (Queensland, Australia),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Information and Communication Technologies|url=http://research.ict.csiro.au/}}&lt;/ref&gt; SeeByte,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SeeByte|url=http://www.seebyte.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's National Research Center for Aeronautics and Space DLR (Wessling, Germany),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DLR - Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics|url=http://www.dlr.de/rm/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-3757/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Computational Vision and Robotics Laboratory CVRL (Crete,Greece),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CVRL: Computational Vision and Robotics Laboratory|url=http://ics.forth.gr/cvrl/contact-info.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fraunhofer Institutes (Germany) among others.

== VIBOT Days ==
