[[Image:PriestleyChart.gif|thumb|right|320px|A redacted version of Priestley's ''Chart of Biography'' (1765)]]
In 1765, 18th-century British [[polymath]] [[Joseph Priestley]] published '''''A Chart of Biography''''' and its accompanying prose description as a supplement to his ''[[Lectures on History and General Policy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Priestley, Joseph. ''A Chart of Biography''. London: J. Johnson, St. Paul's Church Yard, 1765 and Joseph Priestley, ''A description of a chart of biography''. [Warrington] : Printed at Warrington, 1764; ''A Description of a Chart of Biography''. Warrington: Printed by William Eyres, 1765.&lt;/ref&gt; Priestley believed that the chart and ''[[A New Chart of History]]'' (1769) would allow students to "trace out distinctly the dependence of events to distribute them into such periods and divisions as shall lay the whole claim of past transactions in a just and orderly manner."&lt;ref&gt;Qtd. in Sheps, 141-2.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Chart of Biography'' covers a vast timespan, from 1200 BC to 1800 AD, and includes two thousand names. Priestley organized his list into six categories: Statesman and Warriors; Divines and Metaphysicians; Mathematicians and Physicians (natural philosophers were placed here); Poets and Artists; Orators and Critics (prose fiction authors were placed here); and Historians and Antiquarians (lawyers were placed here). Priestley's "principle of selection" was fame, not merit; therefore, as he mentions, the chart is a reflection of current opinion. He also wanted to ensure that his readers would recognize the entires on the chart. Priestley had difficulty assigning all of the people listed to individual categories; he attempted to list them in the category under which their most important work had been done. [[Machiavelli]] is therefore listed as a historian rather than a statesman and [[Cicero]] is listed as a statesman instead of an orator. The chart was also arranged in order of importance; "statesmen are placed on the lower margin, where they are easier to see, because they are the names most familiar to readers."&lt;ref&gt;Sheps, 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLachlan, 253; Sheps, 142-5.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Both ''Charts'' were popular for decades—the ''[[A New Chart of History]]'' went through fifteen editions by 1816.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; The trustees of Warrington were so impressed with Priestley's lectures and charts that they arranged for the [[University of Edinburgh]] to grant him a [[Doctor of Laws|Doctor of Law degree]] in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, 118-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''BT Research''' is part of the ''Technology'' division of [[BT Group]], a provider of communications and services operating in 170 countries.

The organisation embodies an '[[open innovation]]' approach, drawing on external resources such as partnerships with universities, suppliers, partners, customers and start-ups to complement the BT's internal research and innovation programme.  [[BT Group]] is also a partner in collaborative research projects that are part of the UK's [[Technology Strategy Board]] programme, the EU [[Seventh Framework Programme]], and the EU [[Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme]].

__TOC__

== Location ==
[[File:Adastral Hub2.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Adastral Park]]

BT's main research facility is located in the United Kingdom at [[Adastral Park]], near [[Ipswich]] in the county of Suffolk. The Adastral Park site was first planned around 1968 as the Martlesham Heath Post Office Laboratories&lt;ref&gt;English Heritage MOW 'Y' Series Y 6507 etc&lt;/ref&gt; and after completion in 1971 has grown since then to a facility today which has around 4,000 research and development people from both BT and some of its partner companies. Globally, BT has additional research labs in Beijing, Boston MA and Abu Dhabi. The focus of research at BT is Information and Communications Technology (ICT).

The [[Royal Air Force]] were the original residents of the site in Suffolk at [[RAF Martlesham Heath]]. Experimental aircraft test flights flew from the airfield and the name (Adastral Park) is intended to reflect the history of experimentation and innovation, which is the continuing focus for the Park.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The initial models and plans created by the MPBW [successor to the MOW] would appear to indicate the influence of the Thunderbirds TV series of the 1960s.

== Activities ==

=== Current research themes ===

== Academic research partners ==
BT works closely with both academics and students in over 20 institutions globally and has strong partnerships with the [[University of Cambridge]] in the UK, the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) in the USA and [[Tsinghua University]] in China. BT also leads the India-UK Advanced Technology Centre, a consortium of 22 Indian and UK industry and academic partners conducting research into current and next generation fixed and wireless communications.

== History ==
[[File:BT, Martlesham Heath - geograph.org.uk - 161633.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Main building]]

Research in the company was first established in 1921 at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]], London. In 1968 BT began the move of its research to the new site at [[Martlesham Heath]] in Suffolk. By late 1969 small teams of researchers were working at Martlesham. The first new research building was formally opened on 21 November 1975 by Queen [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]]. The architect was Mr Stanislaw Spielrein ARIBA of the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works [MPBW].&lt;ref&gt;RIBA Kalendar 1964-5, p.215&lt;/ref&gt; The new building housed 1,700 people.

== Patents ==
By the turn of the century (2000), the site had produced over 10,000 patents.

== Innovations from BT Research ==

2006 [October] – BT implemented the world's first fully automated 'spam buster' system to track down and tackle professional spammers and 'botnet'-infected customers on the BT broadband network.

2002 [June] – Research and development teams designed and deployed a suite of new business systems allowing the launch of the UK's first commercial broadband internet access service.

1999 [July] – BT announced that it had pushed commercial optical fibre transmission to 80Gbit/s. BT labs demonstrated the world's fastest regenerator&amp;nbsp;– a photonic digital network component.

1995 [June] – BT research designed and developed a [[video on demand]] service, which was trialled in the local area [Ipswich – Colchester], with 2,500 customers. It used asymmetric data on a subscriber's line ([[asymmetric digital subscriber line]]) over copper cables, with a decoder supplied by Apple. [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BT+Interactive+TV+begins+to+recruit+customers+for+world-leading+trial...-a017100736 – article on trial]

1987 [August] – the world's first instantaneous translation of speech by computer was unveiled by BT's research laboratories.

1982 [April] – Europe's first satellite transmission service was launched with Adastral Park's satellite dishes beaming television signals to the [[Orbital Test Satellite]], run by [[Eutelsat]], allowing Finnish and Norwegian viewers to receive the (English language) signals.

1979 [September] – GPO launched [[Prestel]], the world's first viewdata network.

The '''CALorimetric Electron Telescope''' ('''CALET''') is a [[space telescope]] being mainly used to perform high precision observations of electrons and [[gamma-ray astronomy|gamma ray]]s. It tracks the trajectory of [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]], and gamma rays and measures their direction, charge and energy, which may help understand the nature of [[dark matter]] or nearby sources of high-energy particle acceleration.&lt;ref name="Dunn CALET"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dunn |first=Andrea |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/calet |title=Dark Matter and Particle Acceleration in Near Space |work=NASA News |date=9 October 2014 |accessdate=2015-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission was developed and sponsored by the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), involving teams from Japan, Italy, and the United States. CALET was launched aboard JAXA's H-II Transfer Vehicle [[Kounotori 5]] (HTV-5) on August 19, 2015, and was placed on the [[International Space Station]]'s Japanese [[Kibo (ISS module)|Kibo module]].

CALET is an [[astrophysics]] mission that searches for signatures of [[dark matter]] and provides the highest energy direct measurements of the cosmic ray electron spectrum in order to observe discrete sources of high-energy particle acceleration in our local region of the galaxy.&lt;ref name="CALET at NASA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/1074.html |title=CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) - at NASA |work=Japan Aerospace and Exploration Agency (JAXA) |date=27 August 2015 |accessdate=2015-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='JAXA release Oct2015'&gt;[http://global.jaxa.jp/press/2015/10/20151022_calet.htm CALET aboard the ISS Kibo Started the First Direct Electron Observation in Tera Electron Volt Region]. ''JAXA'' Press Release- October 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mission was developed and sponsored by the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), involving teams from Japan, Italy, and the United States. It seeks to understand the mechanisms of particle acceleration and propagation of [[cosmic ray]]s in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy, to identify their sources of acceleration, their elemental composition as a function of energy, and possibly to unveil the nature of [[dark matter]].&lt;ref name="Dunn CALET"/&gt; Such sources seem to be able to accelerate particles to energies far higher than scientists can achieve on Earth using the largest accelerators. Understanding how nature does this is important to space travel and has possible applications here on Earth.&lt;ref name="Dunn CALET"/&gt; The CALET Principal Investigator is Shoji Torii from the [[Waseda University]], Japan; John Wefel is the co-principal investigator for the US team; Pier S. Marrocchesi, is the co-investigator from the Italy team.

Unlike [[optical telescope]]s, CALET operates in a scanning mode. It records each cosmic ray event that enters its field of view and triggers its detectors to take measurements of the cosmic ray in the extremely high energy region of Tera electron volt (TeV, one trillion electron volts).&lt;ref name='JAXA release Oct2015'/&gt;  These measurements are recorded on the space station and sent to a ground station at [[Louisiana State University]] for analyses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://calet.phys.lsu.edu/ CALET USA]. Louisiana State University (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; CALET may also yield evidence of rare interactions between matter and dark matter by working in synergy with the [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]] (AMS) —also aboard the ISS—  that is looking at [[positron]]s and [[antiproton]]s to identify dark matter.&lt;ref name="Dunn CALET"/&gt; Observation will be carried out for 2–5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iss.jaxa.jp/en/kiboexp/ef/calet/ |title=CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET): Background |work=Japan Aerospace and Exploration Agency (JAXA) |date=April 24, 2014 |accessdate=2015-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CALET contains a subpayload CIRC (Compact Infrared Camera) to observe Earth surface, to detect forest fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://circgs.tksc.jaxa.jp/index_e.html |title=Compact Infrared Camera(CIRC) |publisher=JAXA |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The objectives are to understand the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://iss.jaxa.jp/en/kiboexp/ef/calet/ |title=CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET): Background |work=Japan Aerospace and Exploration Agency (JAXA) |date=April 24, 2014 |accessdate=2015-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#origin and mechanisms of acceleration of high-energy [[cosmic ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s
#propagation mechanism of cosmic rays throughout the Galaxy
#identity of [[dark matter]]

As a cosmic ray observatory, CALET aims to clarify high energy space phenomena and dark matter from two perspectives; one is particle creation and annihilation in the field of [[particle physics]] (or nuclear physics) and the other is particle acceleration and propagation in the field of space physics.

== Results ==
CALET first published data on half a million electron and positron cosmic ray events in 2017, finding a spectral index of −3.152 ± 0.016 above 30 GeV.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=CALET Collaboration|last2=Adriani|first2=O.|last3=Akaike|first3=Y.|last4=Asano|first4=K.|last5=Asaoka|first5=Y.|last6=Bagliesi|first6=M. G.|last7=Bigongiari|first7=G.|last8=Binns|first8=W. R.|last9=Bonechi|first9=S.|date=2017-11-01|title=Energy Spectrum of Cosmic-Ray Electron and Positron from 10 GeV to 3 TeV Observed with the Calorimetric Electron Telescope on the International Space Station|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.181101|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=119|issue=18|pages=181101|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.181101|pmid=29219544|arxiv=1712.01711|bibcode=2017PhRvL.119r1101A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/70347|title=First cosmic-ray results from CALET on the ISS - CERN Courier|website=cerncourier.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canadian Impressionism''' is a subclass of [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] art influenced from French Impressionism. [[Guy Wildenstein]] of the [[Wildenstein Institute]] in Paris states in the foreword of A.K. Prakash's ''Impressionism in Canada: A Journey of Rediscovery'' that Canadian impressionism is "the Canadian artists who gleaned much from the French but, in their improvisations, managed to transmute what they learned into an art reflecting the aesthetic concerns of their compatriots and the times in which they lived and worked".&lt;ref&gt;Prakash. 2015. p. xxv&lt;/ref&gt; The early Canadian Impressionist painters belong into the "Group of who?" as coined by James Adams of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-and-architecture/group-of-who-a-new-book-paints-the-fullest-picture-yet-of-canadas-vision-of-impressionism/article21967828/|title=Group of who?

== History ==
Canada's first affair with Impressionism occurred in 1892 in Montreal at W. Scott &amp; Sons' premises.

{{about|the computer architecture|the biological concept|Structural biology}}

A '''cellular architecture''' is a type of [[computer architecture]] prominent in [[parallel computing]]. Cellular architectures are relatively new, with [[IBM]]'s [[Cell microprocessor]] being the first one to reach the market. Cellular architecture takes [[Multi-core (computing)|multi-core architecture]] design to its logical conclusion, by giving the programmer the ability to run large numbers of concurrent threads within a single processor. Each 'cell' is a compute node containing thread units, memory, and communication. Speed-up is achieved by exploiting [[thread-level parallelism]] inherent in many applications.

Cell, a cellular architecture containing 9 cores, is the processor used in the [[PlayStation 3]]. Another prominent cellular architecture is [[Cyclops64]], a massively parallel architecture currently under development by IBM.  

Cellular architectures follow the [[low-level programming]] paradigm, which exposes the programmer to much of the underlying hardware. This allows the programmer to greatly optimize their code for the platform, but at the same time makes it more difficult to [[software development|develop software]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4764">A '''China watcher''', or, less frequently, '''Pekingologist''', is a person who reports on the [[politics of the People's Republic of China]] for [[Western world|western]] consumption, especially in a [[Cold War]] context. "China watching" was coined by analogy to [[birdwatching]], which takes place from a distance. It represents a semantic break from the earlier term [[China Hands]], which referred to knowledgeable businesspeople who made political commentary from inside mainland China: after the [[Chinese Revolution of 1949]], China watchers more frequently had backgrounds in academia, rather than business, and operated out of consulates in [[Hong Kong]].&lt;ref name="Safire"&gt;{{cite book|title=Safire's Political Dictionary|first=William|last=Safire|authorlink=William Safire|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|pages=118-119|chapter=China watchers}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

"China watcher" can be distinguished from [[Sinologist]], which can loosely refer to anyone who studies China, but, especially in the United States, more frequently refers to those who study classical language, literature, or civilization.&lt;ref&gt;American Heritage Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; In other languages, where the term ''Pekingologist'' does not exist, the usage of these terms are less rigidly delineated. In French for instance, the term ''sinologue'' would refer to both a researcher in Sinology and a reporter of Pekingology.

==History and nature of China watching==
During the [[Cold War]], China watchers centered in [[Hong Kong]] and many of them simultaneously worked for Western [[intelligence agencies]], universities, and news organizations. Much of their reporting would be previewed by the British colonial government's [[Government Secretariat (Hong Kong)|secretariat]], to prepare for diplomatic consequences. Of the various nationalities of China watcher, the Americans were the most prolific, due to the activity of the [[Consulate General of the United States, Hong Kong and Macau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gittings|1972|p=418}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutual distrust between the United States and China and the prohibition of travel between the countries meant that American China watchers did not have access to press briefings or interviews. Therefore, China watchers adopted techniques from [[Kremlinology]], such as the close parsing of official announcements for hidden meanings, movements of officials reported in newspapers, and analysis of photographs of public appearances.&lt;ref&gt; Gail Solin, "The Art of China Watching" [https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol19no1/html/v19i1a04p_0001.htm#top Center for the Study of Intelligence &gt; Studies Archive ]&lt;/ref&gt; China watchers would also interview refugees from mainland China, or reprint analysis from Taiwan or the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gittings|1972|pp=415, 421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent China watchers in Hong Kong in the first decades after the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Communist revolution of 1949]] included [[László Ladány]] and [[Pierre Ryckmans (writer)|Pierre Ryckmans]]. Publications by the Consulate-General, which were frequently cited by China-watchers (some of whom did not speak Chinese) included ''Survey of the China Mainland Press'', ''Current Background'', and ''Selections from Mainland China Magazines''. These publications emphasized problems and contradictions in national policy, violence, and atrocity, ignoring topics like education or culture unless there was an associated controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gittings|1972|pp=420}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years since the [[reform and opening up]], China watchers can live in China and take advantage of normal sources of information. Others remained in Hong Kong, however. The Hong Kong journalist [[Willy Lam|Willy Wo-Lap Lam]] has been called the "quintessential China watcher, practiced in the art of Pekingology," whose "scope is wide, but the focus of his analysis is the [[Zhongnanhai]] and factional manoeuvring among the political elite."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Shambaugh]], China Quarterly 142 (June 1995): 608.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2440">The '''Coastal Observatory''' in Liverpool Bay is housed at the [[Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory]] in Brownlow Street
[[Liverpool]], [[England]].

== Objectives ==
The objective of the Coastal Observatory is to study a typical coastal sea's response both to natural forces and to the effects of human activity. The Observatory integrates real-time data measurements with data from models into a "pre-operational coastal prediction system"&lt;sup&gt;[http://cobs.pol.ac.uk/cobsadmin/about.html]&lt;/sup&gt; whose results will be displayed on the [http://cobs.pol.ac.uk web site].

The concept is founded on obtaining data in real time, using telemetry, sending the data from underwater to the sea surface, to land, to the [[Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory]] to the [http://cobs.pol.ac.uk web site], enabling what is often known as 'armchair oceanography'.

The aim of the Coastal Observatory is to build a time series of data. The Observatory has a particular interest in such areas as storm surges, seasonality, and variations in river discharge, with an emphasis on the River Mersey.

== Measurements ==
August 2007 marked five years of continuous running of the Coastal Observatory in Liverpool Bay, taking measurements such as:
*In situ time series of current, temperature and salinity profiles and of waves and weather. A second site, and measurements of turbidity and chlorophyll are now also operational.
*The [http://www.cefas.co.uk/Products/smartbuoy.htm CEFAS SmartBuoy] for surface properties including nutrients and chlorophyll.
*Instrumented ferries for near surface temperature, salinity, turbidity, chlorophyll and later, nutrient data. The first route was Liverpool to Douglas (Isle of Man), with the ferry travelling between Birkenhead (Liverpool) and Dublin (Ireland)
*Drifters, measuring surface currents and properties such as temperature and salinity.
*Tide gauges, with sensors for meteorological, waves, temperature and salinity data, where appropriate.
*Meteorological data from HF radar and tide gauge sites.
*Shore-base HF radar measuring waves and surface currents out to a range of 50&amp;nbsp;km.
*Satellite data - infra-red (for [[sea surface temperature]]) and visible (for chlorophyll and suspended sediment) spectra.

'''Computer graphics''' is a sub-field of [[Computer Science]] which studies methods for digitally synthesizing and manipulating visual content.  Although the term often refers to the study of [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional computer graphics]], it also encompasses [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional graphics]] and [[image processing]].

== Overview ==
Computer graphics studies the manipulation of visual and geometric information using computational techniques.  It focuses on the ''mathematical'' and ''computational'' foundations of image generation and processing rather than purely [[aesthetic]] issues.  Computer graphics is often differentiated from the field of [[visualization (graphic)|visualization]], although the two fields have many similarities.

Connected studies include:
* [[Applied mathematics]]
* [[Computational geometry]]
* [[Computational topology]]
* [[Computer vision]]
* [[Image processing]]
* [[Information visualization]]
* [[Scientific visualization]]

Applications of computer graphics include:
*[[Print design]]
*[[Digital art]]
*[[Special effect]]s
*[[Video game]]s
*[[Visual effects]]

There are several international conferences and journals where the most significant results in computer graphics are published. Among them are the [[SIGGRAPH]] and [[Eurographics]] conferences and the [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) Transactions on Graphics journal. The joint Eurographics and [[ACM SIGGRAPH]] symposium series features the major venues for the more specialized sub-fields: Symposium on Geometry Processing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geometryprocessing.org |title=geometryprocessing.org |publisher=geometryprocessing.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symposium on Rendering, and Symposium on Computer Animation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eg.org/events ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314004027/http://www.eg.org/events |date=March 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in the rest of computer science, conference publications in computer graphics are generally more significant than journal publications (and subsequently have lower acceptance rates).&lt;ref name="cra memo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cra.org/reports/tenure_review.html |title=Best Practices Memo |publisher=Cra.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ernst note"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.csail.mit.edu/mernst/advice/conferences-vs-journals.html |title=Choosing a venue: conference or journal? |publisher=People.csail.mit.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="graphics acceptance rates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vrlab.epfl.ch/~ulicny/statistics/ |title=Graphics/vision publications acceptance rates statistics |publisher=Vrlab.epfl.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An extensive history of computer graphics can be found at [http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/lessons.html this page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405172134/http://accad.osu.edu/~waynec/history/lessons.html |date=April 5, 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subfields ==
A broad classification of major subfields in computer graphics might be:

# [[Geometry]]: studies ways to represent and process surfaces
# [[Animation]]: studies ways to represent and manipulate motion
# [[Rendering (computer graphics)|Rendering]]: studies [[algorithm]]s to reproduce light transport
# [[Digital imaging|Imaging]]: studies image acquisition or image editing
# [[Topology]]: studies the behaviour of spaces and surfaces.

=== Geometry ===
[[Image:Stanford bunny qem.png|thumb|Successive approximations of a surface computed using quadric error metrics.]]

The subfield of geometry studies the representation of three-dimensional objects in a discrete digital setting.  Because the appearance of an object depends largely on its exterior, [[boundary representation]]s are most commonly used.  Two dimensional [[Surface (topology)|surface]]s are a good representation for most objects, though they may be non-[[manifold]].  Since surfaces are not finite, discrete digital approximations are used. [[polygon mesh|Polygonal meshes]] (and to a lesser extent [[subdivision surfaces]]) are by far the most common representation, although point-based representations have become more popular recently (see for instance the Symposium on Point-Based Graphics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphics.ethz.ch/events/pbg/07/ |title=Point Based Graphics 2007 - PBG07 |publisher=Graphics.ethz.ch |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These representations are ''Lagrangian,'' meaning the spatial locations of the samples are independent.  Recently, ''Eulerian'' surface descriptions (i.e., where spatial samples are fixed) such as [[level set]]s have been developed into a useful representation for deforming surfaces which undergo many topological changes (with [[fluids]] being the most notable example).&lt;ref name="stanford fedkiw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphics.stanford.edu/~fedkiw/ |title=Ron Fedkiw |publisher=Graphics.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Geometry Subfields
* Implicit surface modeling – an older subfield which examines the use of algebraic surfaces, [[constructive solid geometry]], etc., for surface representation.
* Digital geometry processing – [[3d scanning|surface reconstruction]], simplification, fairing, mesh repair, [[mesh parameterization|parameterization]], remeshing, [[mesh generation]], surface compression, and surface editing all fall under this heading.&lt;ref name="caltech multires dgp"&gt;[http://www.multires.caltech.edu/pubs/DGPCourse/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214021951/http://www.multires.caltech.edu/pubs/DGPCourse/ |date=February 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uiuc graphics dgp"&gt;[http://graphics.cs.uiuc.edu/~garland/class/geometry/ CS 598: Digital Geometry Processing (Fall 2004)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20041025104252/http://graphics.cs.uiuc.edu/~garland/class/geometry/ |date=2004-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ubc sheffa dgp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~sheffa/dgp/ |title=Digital Geometry Processing |publisher=Cs.ubc.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Discrete differential geometry – a nascent field which defines geometric quantities for the discrete surfaces used in computer graphics.&lt;ref name="columbia ddg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ddg.cs.columbia.edu/ |title=Discrete Differential Geometry |publisher=Ddg.cs.columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Point-based graphics – a recent field which focuses on points as the fundamental representation of surfaces.
* [[Subdivision surfaces]]
* Out-of-core mesh processing – another recent field which focuses on mesh datasets that do not fit in main memory.

=== Animation ===
The subfield of animation studies descriptions for surfaces (and other phenomena) that move or deform over time.  Historically, most work in this field has focused on parametric and data-driven models, but recently [[physical simulation]] has become more popular as computers have become more powerful computationally.

;Subfields
* Performance capture
* Character animation
* Physical simulation (e.g. [[cloth modeling]],  animation of [[fluid dynamics]], etc.)

=== Rendering ===
[[Image:Cornellbox pathtracing irradiancecaching.png|thumb|Indirect diffuse scattering simulated using [[path tracing]] and [[irradiance caching]].]]

Rendering generates images from a model.  Rendering may simulate [[light transport theory|light transport]] to create realistic images or it may create images that have a particular artistic style in [[non-photorealistic rendering]].  The two basic operations in realistic rendering are transport (how much light passes from one place to another) and scattering (how surfaces interact with light).  See [[Rendering (computer graphics)]] for more information.

;Transport
[[light transport theory|Transport]] describes how illumination in a scene gets from one place to another. [[visibility (geometry)|Visibility]] is a major component of light transport.

;Scattering
Models of ''scattering'' and ''shading'' are used to describe the appearance of a surface.  In graphics these problems are often studied within the context of rendering since they can substantially affect the design of [[rendering algorithm]]s.  Shading can be broken down into two orthogonal issues, which are often studied independently:

# '''scattering''' – how light interacts with the surface ''at a given point''
# '''shading''' – how material properties vary across the surface

The former problem refers to [[scattering]], i.e., the relationship between incoming and outgoing illumination at a given point.  Descriptions of scattering are usually given in terms of a [[bidirectional scattering distribution function]] or BSDF.  The latter issue addresses how different types of scattering are distributed across the surface (i.e., which scattering function applies where).  Descriptions of this kind are typically expressed with a program called a [[shader]].  (Note that there is some confusion since the word "shader" is sometimes used for programs that describe local ''geometric'' variation.)

;Other subfields
* physically based rendering – concerned with generating images according to the laws of [[geometric optics]]
* [[Real-time rendering|real time rendering]] – focuses on rendering for interactive applications, typically using specialized hardware like [[graphics processing unit|GPUs]]
* [[non-photorealistic rendering]]
* relighting – recent area concerned with quickly re-rendering scenes

'''Diploblasty''' is a condition of the [[blastula]] in which there are two primary [[germ layer]]s: the [[ectoderm]] and [[endoderm]].

Diploblastic organisms are organisms which develop from such a blastula, and include [[cnidaria]] and [[ctenophora]], formerly grouped together in the phylum Coelenterata, but later understanding of their differences resulted in their being placed in separate phyla.

The endoderm allows them to develop true [[Biological tissue|tissue]]. This includes tissue associated with the gut and associated glands. The ectoderm, on the other hand, gives rise to the epidermis, the nervous tissue, and if present, nephridia.

Simpler animals, such as [[sea sponges]], have one germ layer and lack true tissue organization.

All the more complex animals (from flat worms to humans) are [[triploblastic]] with three germ layers (a [[mesoderm]] as well as ectoderm and endoderm). The mesoderm allows them to develop true [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]].

Groups of diploblastic animals alive today include jellyfish, corals, sea anemones and comb jellies.

'''Duncan's taxonomy''' is a classification of [[computer architecture]]s, proposed by Ralph Duncan in 1990.&lt;ref name=duncan&gt;Duncan, Ralph, "A Survey of Parallel Computer Architectures", IEEE Computer. February 1990, pp. 5-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Duncan proposed modifications to [[Flynn's taxonomy]]&lt;ref name=flynn&gt;Flynn, M.J., "Very High Speed Computing Systems", Proc. IEEE. Vol. 54, 1966, pp.1901-1909.&lt;/ref&gt; to include pipelined vector processes.&lt;ref name=vhsc&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=W3Ld65MnwgkC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;lpg=PA25&amp;dq=Duncan%27s+Taxonomy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TcxNTapqdo&amp;sig=ck7xsVYTYnJVsaS8Swxy23d6AHc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=L7ArTOG7CsGBlAe_tN2vCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Duncan%27s%20Taxonomy&amp;f=false Introduction to Parallel Algorithms]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The taxonomy was developed during 1988-1990 and was first published in 1990.  Its original categories are indicated below.

===Synchronous Architectures===
This category includes all the parallel architectures that coordinate concurrent execution in lockstep fashion and do so via mechanisms such as global clocks, central control units or vector unit controllers.  Further subdivision of this category is made primarily on the basis of the synchronization mechanism.&lt;ref name=duncan/&gt;

====Pipelined vector processors====
''Pipelined vector processors'' are characterized by pipelined functional units that accept a sequential stream of array or ''vector'' elements, such that different stages in a filled pipeline are processing different elements of the vector at a given time.&lt;ref name="Hwang84"&gt;Hwang, K., ed., ''Tutorial Supercomputers: Design and Applications.'' Computer Society Press, Los Alamitos, California, 1984, esp. chapters 1 and 2.&lt;/ref&gt;   Parallelism is provided both by the pipelining in individual functional units described above, as well as by operating multiple units of this kind in parallel and by ''chaining'' the output of one unit into another unit as input.&lt;ref name="Hwang84"/&gt;

Vector architectures that stream vector elements into functional units from special vector registers are termed ''register-to-register'' architectures, while those that feed functional units from special memory buffers are designated as '' memory-to-memory'' architectures.&lt;ref name="duncan"/&gt;  Early examples of register-to-register architectures from the 1960s and early 1970s include the [[Cray-1]]&lt;ref name="Russell78"&gt;Russell, R.M., "The CRAY-1 Computer System," Comm. ACM, Jan. 1978, pp. 63-72.&lt;/ref&gt; and Fujitsu VP-200, while the Control Data Cyber 205 and Texas Instruments Advanced Scientific Computer&lt;ref name="Watson72"&gt;Watson, W.J., ''The ASC: a Highly Modular Flexible Super Computer Architecture,'' Proc. AFIPS Fall Joint Computer Conference, 1972, pp. 221-228.&lt;/ref&gt;  are early examples of memory-to-memory vector architectures.

The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the introduction of vector architectures, such as the Cray Y-MP/4 and Nippon Electric Corporation SX-3 that supported 4-10 vector processors with a shared memory (see [[NEC SX architecture]]).

====SIMD====

This scheme uses the ''SIMD'' (Single Instruction Stream, Multiple Data Stream) category from [[Flynn's Taxonomy]] as a root class for ''Processor Array'' and ''Associative Memory'' subclasses.  SIMD architectures&lt;ref name="simd96"&gt;Michael Jurczyk and Thomas Schwederski,"SIMD-Processing: Concepts and Systems", pp. 649-679 in Parallel and Distributed Computing Handbook, A. Zomaya, ed., McGraw-Hill, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; are characterized by having a control unit broadcast a common instruction to all processing elements, which execute that instruction in lockstep on diverse operands from local data.  Common features include the ability for individual processors to disable an instruction and the ability to propagate instruction results to immediate neighbors over an interconnection network.

=====Processor Array=====

=====Associative Memory=====

====Systolic Array====
''Systolic arrays,'' proposed during the 1980s&lt;ref name="HTKung"&gt;Kung, H.T., "Why Systolic Arrays?", Computer, Vol. 15, No. 1, Jan. 1982, pp. 37-46.&lt;/ref&gt; are multiprocessors in which data and partial results are rhythmically pumped from processor to processor through a regular, local interconnection network.&lt;ref name="duncan"/&gt;  Systolic architectures use a global clock and explicit timing delays to synchronize data flow from processor to processor.&lt;ref name="duncan"/&gt;  Each processor in a systolic system executes an invariant sequence of instructions before data and results are pulsed to neighboring processors.&lt;ref name="HTKung"/&gt;

===MIMD Architectures===
Based on Flynn's Multiple-Instruction-Multiple-Data Streams terminology, this category spans a wide spectrum of architectures in which processors execute multiple instruction sequences on (potentially) dissimilar data streams without strict synchronization.  Although both instruction and data streams can be different for each processor, they need not be.  Thus, MIMD architectures can run identical programs that are in various stages at any given time, run unique instruction and data streams on each processor or execute a combination of each these scenarios.  This category is subdivided further primarily on the basis of memory organization.&lt;ref name=duncan/&gt;

====Distributed Memory====

====Shared Memory====

===MIMD-paradigm Architectures===
The MIMD-Based Paradigms category subsumes systems in which a specific programming or execution paradigm is at least as fundamental 
to the architectural design as structural considerations are.  Thus, the design of ''dataflow architectures'' and ''reduction machines'' is as much the product of supporting their distinctive execution paradigm as it is a product of connecting processors and memories in MIMD fashion.  The category's subdivisions are defined by these paradigms.&lt;ref name=duncan/&gt;

====MIMD/SIMD hybrid====

====Dataflow Machine====

====Reduction Machine====

====Wavefront Array====

&lt;/ref&gt; The ecological niche describes how an organism or population responds to the distribution of [[Resource (biology)|resources]] and competitors (for example, by growing when resources are abundant, and when [[predator]]s, [[parasite]]s and [[pathogen]]s are scarce) and how it in turn alters those same factors (for example, limiting access to resources by other organisms, acting as a food source for predators and a consumer of prey).

&lt;/ref&gt;

A Grinnellian niche is determined by the [[habitat]] in which a species lives and its accompanying [[Behavioral ecology|behavioral adaptations]]. An Eltonian niche emphasizes that a species not only grows in and responds to an environment, it may also change the environment and its behavior as it grows. The Hutchinsonian niche uses mathematics and statistics to try to explain how species coexist within a given community.

The notion of ecological niche is central to ecological [[biogeography]], which focuses on spatial patterns of ecological communities.&lt;ref name=Biogeography&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mark V Lomolino |author2=Brett R Riddle |author3=James H Brown |title=Biogeography |publisher=Sinauer Associates |location=Sunderland, Mass |year=2009 |edition=3rd |pages= |isbn=978-0878934867 |quote=The geographic range of a species can be viewed as a spatial reflection of its niche |page=73 |chapter=The geographic range as a reflection of the niche}} [https://www.amazon.com/Biogeography-Third-Mark-V-Lomolino/dp/0878934863/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1400001561&amp;sr=1-1#reader_0878934863 Viewable on line] via Amazon's 'look-inside' feature.

&lt;/ref&gt; Alteration of an ecological niche by its inhabitants is the topic of [[niche construction]].&lt;ref name=Townsend&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of species exist in a standard ecological niche, sharing behaviors, adaptations, and [[Functional group (ecology)|functional traits]] similar to the other closely related species within the same broad [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] class, but there are exceptions. A premier example of a non-standard niche filling species is the flightless, ground-dwelling [[kiwi]] bird of New Zealand, which feeds on worms and other ground creatures, and lives its life in a mammal-like niche. [[Island biogeography]] can help explain island species and associated unfilled niches.

==Grinnellian niche==
[[File:P1180957 Arles rue du Quatre-Septembre n14 rwk.jpg|thumb|upright|A niche: the place where a statue may stand]]

The ecological meaning of niche comes from the meaning of niche as a recess in a wall for a statue,&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/126748|title=Niche|work=Oxford English Dictionary {{Subscription required}}|accessdate=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which itself is probably derived from the [[Middle French]] word ''nicher'', meaning ''to nest''.&lt;ref name="webster"/&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford"/&gt; 
The term was coined by the naturalist [[Roswell Hill Johnson]]&lt;ref name=Johnson1910&gt;
{{cite book |last= Johnson |first= Roswell |date= 1910 |title= Determinate evolution in the color-pattern of the lady-beetles |url= |location= Washington |publisher= Carnegie Institution of Washington|page= |isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
but [[Joseph Grinnell]] was probably the first to use it in a research program in 1917, in his paper "The niche relationships of the California Thrasher".&lt;ref name=Grinnell1917&gt;{{cite journal |author = Joseph Grinnell |year = 1917 |title = The niche-relationships of the California Thrasher |journal = The Auk |volume = 34 |pages = 427–433 |url = http://artifex.org/~ecoreaders/lit/Grinnell1917.pdf |doi = 10.2307/4072271 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160310144027/http://artifex.org/~ecoreaders/lit/Grinnell1917.pdf |archivedate = 2016-03-10 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pocheville2015 /&gt;

The Grinnellian niche concept embodies the idea that the niche of a species is determined by the [[habitat]] in which it lives and its accompanying [[Behavioral ecology|behavioral adaptations]]. In other words, the niche is the sum of the habitat requirements and behaviors that allow a species to persist and produce offspring. For example, the behavior of the [[California thrasher]] is consistent with the [[chaparral]] habitat it lives in—it breeds and feeds in the underbrush and escapes from its predators by shuffling from underbrush to underbrush. Its 'niche' is defined by the felicitous complementing of the thrasher's behavior and physical traits (camouflaging color, short wings, strong legs) with this habitat.&lt;ref name=Grinnell1917/&gt;

This perspective of niche allows for the existence of both ecological equivalents and empty niches. An ecological equivalent to an organism is an organism from a different taxonomic group exhibiting similar adaptations in a similar habitat, an example being the different [[Succulent plant|succulents]] found in American and African deserts, [[cactus]] and [[euphorbia]], respectively.&lt;ref name=Huggett&gt;
{{cite book |author=Richard J. Huggett |title=Fundamentals of Biogeography |page=76 |isbn=9780415323475 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZR68HCMmPjoC&amp;pg=PA76 |publisher=Psychology Press |year=2004}}
&lt;/ref&gt; As another example, the [[anole]] lizards of the [[Greater Antilles]] are a rare example of [[convergent evolution]], [[adaptive radiation]], and the existence of ecological equivalents: the anole lizards evolved in similar [[Habitat#Microhabitat|microhabitats]] independently of each other and resulted in the same [[ecomorph]]s across all four islands.

==Eltonian niche==
In 1927 [[Charles Sutherland Elton]], a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[ecologist]], defined a niche as follows: "The 'niche' of an animal means its place in the biotic environment, ''its relations to food and enemies''."&lt;ref name=Elton2001&gt;
{{cite book

|isbn = 978-0226206394
|accessdate=May 14, 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elton classified niches according to [[foraging]] activities ("food habits"):&lt;ref name=Chase&gt;
"Elton focused on the niche of a species as its functional role within the food chain and its impact upon the environment" {{cite book |author1=Jonathan M. Chase |author2=Mathew A. Leibold |title=Ecological Niches: Linking Classical and Contemporary Approaches |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ssmcl_ubQUQC&amp;pg=PA7 |page=7 |isbn=9780226101804 |year=2003 |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For instance there is the niche that is filled by birds of prey which eat small animals such as shrews and mice. In an oak wood this niche is filled by [[tawny owl]]s, while in the open grassland it is occupied by [[kestrel]]s. The existence of this carnivore niche is dependent on the further fact that mice form a definite herbivore niche in many different associations, although the actual species of mice may be quite different.&lt;ref name=Elton2001/&gt;}}

Conceptually, the Eltonian niche introduces the idea of a species' ''response'' ''to'' and ''effect on'' the environment. Unlike other niche concepts, it emphasizes that a species not only grows in and responds to an environment based on available resources, predators, and climatic conditions, but also changes the availability and behavior of those factors as it grows. In an extreme example, [[beaver]]s require certain resources in order to survive and reproduce, but also construct dams that alter water flow in the river where the beaver lives. Thus, the beaver affects the biotic and abiotic conditions of other species that live in and near the watershed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Beaver as Engineers: Influences on Biotic and Abiotic Characteristics of Drainage Basins |publisher = Springer |year= 1995 |isbn = 978-1-4613-5714-8 |pages = 117–126 |doi = 10.1007/978-1-4615-1773-3_12 |first = Michael M. |last = Pollock |first2 = Robert J. |last2 = Naiman |first3 = Heather E. |last3 = Erickson|first4 = Carol A.|last4 = Johnston|first5 = John|last5 = Pastor|first6 = Gilles|last6 = Pinay|editor-first = Clive G.|editor-last = Jones|editor-first2 = John H.|editor-last2 = Lawton}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a more subtle case, competitors that consume resources at different rates can lead to cycles in resource density that differ between species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Competitive Exclusion |jstor= 2460592 |journal = The American Naturalist|date = February 1980 |pages = 151–170 |volume = 115|issue = 2 |first = Robert A. |last = Armstrong |first2 = Richard |last2 = McGehee |doi=10.1086/283553}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only do species grow differently with respect to resource density, but their own population growth can [[relative nonlinearity|affect resource density over time]].

==Hutchinsonian niche==&lt;!-- Hutchinsonian niche redirects here--&gt;
[[File:Purple-throated carib hummingbird feeding.jpg|thumb|The shape of the [[beak|bill]] of this [[purple-throated carib]] is complementary to the shape of the flower and [[coevolution|coevolved]] with it, enabling it to exploit the nectar as a resource.]]

The Hutchinsonian niche is an "[[N-dimensional space|n-dimensional]] hypervolume", where the dimensions are environmental conditions and [[Resource (biology)|resources]], that define the requirements of an individual or a species to practice "its" way of life, more particularly, for its population to persist.&lt;ref name=Levin/&gt; The "hypervolume" defines the multi-dimensional space of resources (e.g., light, nutrients, structure, etc.) available to (and specifically used by) organisms, and "all species other than those under consideration are regarded as part of the coordinate system."&lt;ref name=Hutchinson1957&gt;{{cite journal

The niche concept was popularized by the zoologist [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]] in 1957.&lt;ref name=Hutchinson1957/&gt; Hutchinson inquired into the question of why there are so many types of organisms in any one habitat. His work inspired many others to develop models to explain how many and how similar coexisting species could be within a given community, and led to the concepts of [[Realized niche width#Niche width vs. realized niche width|'niche breadth']] (the variety of resources or habitats used by a given species), [[Niche differentiation|'niche partitioning']] (resource differentiation by coexisting species), and 'niche overlap' (overlap of resource use by different species).&lt;ref name=Chase2&gt;{{cite book |author1=Jonathan M. Chase |author2=Mathew A. Leibold |title=Ecological Niches: Linking Classical and Contemporary Approaches |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ssmcl_ubQUQC&amp;pg=PA11 |page=11 |isbn=9780226101804 |year=2003 |publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Resource allocation.png|thumb|Where three species eat some of the same prey, a statistical picture of each niche shows overlap in resource usage between three species, indicating where competition is strongest.]]

Statistics were introduced into the Hutchinson niche by [[Robert MacArthur]] and [[Richard Levins]] using the 'resource-utilization' niche employing histograms to describe the 'frequency of occurrence' as a function of a Hutchinson coordinate.&lt;ref name=Levin/&gt;&lt;ref name=MacArthur&gt;{{cite journal |author=Robert H. MacArthur |title=Population ecology of some warblers of northeastern coniferous forests |journal=Ecology |volume=39 |issue=4 |year=1958 |pages=599–619 |url=http://people.biology.ufl.edu/troutinthemilk/IGERT/MacArthur_1958.pdf |doi=10.2307/1931600}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, for instance, a [[Normal distribution|Gaussian]] might describe the frequency with which a species ate prey of a certain size, giving a more detailed niche description than simply specifying some median or average prey size. For such a bell-shaped distribution, the ''position'', ''width'' and ''form'' of the niche correspond to the ''mean'', ''standard deviation'' and the actual distribution itself.&lt;ref name=Putnam&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NCpkrNG6xFkC&amp;pg=PA107 |page=107 |author1=Rory Putman |author2=Stephen D. Wratten |title=Principles of ecology |chapter=§5.2 Parameters of the niche  |isbn=9780520052543 |year=1984 |publisher=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; One advantage in using statistics is illustrated in the figure, where it is clear that for the narrower distributions (top) there is no competition for prey between the extreme left and extreme right species, while for the broader distribution (bottom), niche overlap indicates competition can occur between all species. The resource-utilization approach consists in postulating that not only competition ''can'' occur, but also that it ''does'' occur, and that overlap in resource utilization directly enables the estimation of the competition coefficients.&lt;ref name=Schoener1986&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schoener |first1=Thomas W. |date=1986 |chapter=The Ecological Niche |editor1-last=Cherret |editor1-first=J. M. |title=Ecological concepts: the contribution of ecology to an understanding of the natural world |location=Cambridge |publisher=Blackwell Scientific  Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; This postulate, however, can be misguided, as it ignores the impacts that the resources of each category have on the organism and the impacts that the organism has on the resources of each category. For instance, the resource in the overlap region can be non-limiting, in which case there is no competition for this resource despite niche overlap.&lt;ref name=Pocheville2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chase2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schoener1986/&gt;

An organism free of interference from other species could use the full range of conditions (biotic and abiotic) and resources in which it could survive and reproduce which is called its '''fundamental niche'''.&lt;ref name=Griesemer&gt;{{cite book |title=Keywords in Evolutionary Biology |author=James R. Griesemer |page=239 |editors=Evelyn Fox Keller, Elisabeth A. Lloyd|chapter=Niche: Historical perspectives |isbn=9780674503137 |year=1994 |publisher=Harvard University Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hvm7sCuyRV4C&amp;pg=PA239 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as a result of pressure from, and interactions with, other organisms (i.e. inter-specific competition) species are usually forced to occupy a niche that is narrower than this, and to which they are mostly highly [[adaptation|adapted]]; this is termed the [[Realized niche width|realized niche]].&lt;ref name=Griesemer/&gt; Hutchinson used the idea of competition for resources as the primary mechanism driving ecology, but overemphasis upon this focus has proved to be a handicap for the niche concept.&lt;ref name=Chase2/&gt; In particular, overemphasis upon a species' dependence upon resources has led to too little emphasis upon the effects of organisms on their environment, for instance, colonization and invasions.&lt;ref name=Chase2/&gt;

The term "adaptive zone" was coined by the paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]] to explain how a population could jump from one niche to another that suited it, jump to an 'adaptive zone', made available by virtue of some modification, or possibly a change in the [[food chain]], that made the adaptive zone available to it without a discontinuity in its way of life because the group was 'pre-adapted' to the new ecological opportunity.&lt;ref name=Schluter&gt;{{cite book |title=The Ecology of Adaptive Radiation |chapter=§4.2: The ecological theory |author=Dolph Schluter |page=69 |isbn=9780191588327 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year= 2000 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1wxNmLAL10C&amp;pg=PA69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mistletoe infested tree.jpg|thumb|upright|As a hemi-[[parasitic plant]], the [[mistletoe]] in this tree exploits its host for nutrients and as a place to grow.]]

Hutchinson's "niche" (a description of the ecological space occupied by a species) is subtly different from the "niche" as defined by Grinnell (an ecological role, that may or may not be actually filled by a species—see [[vacant niches]]).

A niche is a very specific segment of ecospace occupied by a single species. On the presumption that no two species are identical in all respects (called Hardin's 'axiom of inequality'&lt;ref name =Hardin&gt;{{cite journal |author=Garrett Hardin |title=The competitive exclusion principle |journal =Science |volume=131 |pages=1292–1297 |issue=3409 |year=1960 |url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/schulz/seminars/hardin.pdf|format=PDF |doi=10.1126/science.131.3409.1292 |pmid=14399717}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and the [[competitive exclusion principle]], ''some'' resource or adaptive dimension will provide a niche specific to each species.&lt;ref name=Griesemer/&gt; Species can however share a 'mode of life' or 'autecological strategy' which are broader definitions of ecospace.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author=Sahney, S., Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal=Biology Letters | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544–547 | pmc=2936204 | issue=4 | pmid=20106856}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Australian grasslands species, though different from those of the [[Great Plains]] grasslands, exhibit similar modes of life.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20041010205937/http://collections.ic.gc.ca/abnature/glossary.htm Glossary for the Nature of Alberta]&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a niche is left vacant, other organisms can fill that position. For example, the niche that was left vacant by the extinction of the [[Equus ferus ferus|tarpan]] has been filled by other animals (in particular a small horse breed, the [[konik]]). Also, when plants and animals are introduced into a new environment, they have the potential to occupy or invade the niche or niches of native organisms, often outcompeting the indigenous species. Introduction of [[non-indigenous species]] to non-native [[habitat]]s by humans often results in biological pollution by the exotic or [[invasive species]].

The mathematical representation of a species' fundamental niche in ecological space, and its subsequent projection back into geographic space, is the domain of [[environmental niche modelling|niche modelling]].&lt;ref&gt;On the logic of the relation between the niche and the corresponding geographic environment see Barry Smith and Achille Varzi, "[http://ontology.buffalo.edu/smith/articles/niches.pdf The Niche]", Nous, 33:2 (1999), 198–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parameters==
The different dimensions, or plot axes, of a niche represent different biotic and abiotic variables. These factors may include descriptions of the organism's [[Biological life cycle|life history]], [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]], trophic position (place in the [[food chain]]), and geographic range. According to the [[competitive exclusion principle]], no two species can occupy the same niche in the same environment for a long time. The parameters of a realized niche are described by the [[realized niche width]] of that species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.131.3409.1292 | author = Hardin G. | authorlink = Garrett Hardin | year = 1960 | title = The Competitive Exclusion Principle | url = | journal = Science | volume = 131 | issue = 3409| pages = 1292–1297 | pmid = 14399717 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some plants and animals, called specialists, need specific habitats and surroundings to survive, such as the [[spotted owl]], which lives specifically in old growth forests. Other plants and animals, called generalists, are not as particular and can survive in a range of conditions, for example the [[dandelion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Human-Environment Geography|last=Moseley|first=William|last2=Perramond|first2=Eric|last3=Hapke|first3=Holly|last4=Laris|first4=Paul|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4051-8932-3|location=West Sussex, UK|pages=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19076">'''Enterprise systems engineering''' ('''ESE''') is the discipline that applies [[systems engineering]] to the design of an [[business|enterprise]].&lt;ref name="regdes"&gt;R.E. Giachetti (2010). Design of Enterprise Systems: Theory, Architecture, and Methods, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  As a discipline, it includes a body of knowledge, principles, and   processes tailored to the design of enterprise systems. An enterprise is a complex, socio-technical system that comprises interdependent resources of people, information, and technology that must interact to fulfill a common mission.&lt;ref name="regdes" /&gt;

It accomplishes all of the tasks of "traditional" systems engineering, further informed by an expansive view of the context POET (political, operational, economic, technological) in which the system(s) under consideration are being developed, acquired, modified, maintained, or disposed of.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Enterprise systems engineering may be required when the complexity being faced which breaks down the assumptions upon which textbook systems engineering is based, such as requirements being relatively stable and well understood, a system configuration that can be controlled, and a small, easily discernible set of stakeholders.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Enterprise must produce different kind of analysis on the people, technology, components of the company in order to see the whole picture of the enterprise. As nowadays, enterprise becomes more complex with more problems and people to deal with, it is important to integrated the system in order to reach a higher standard or level for the business.&lt;ref name="Joannou 2007"/&gt;

== Elements ==
There are four important elements in order for enterprise system engineering to work. It includes development through adaption, strategic technical planning, enterprise governance and ESE processes (with different stages).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Enterprise Systems Engineering: Advances in the Theory and Practice|last = |first = |publisher = Boca Raton ; London : CRC Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1420073294|location = |page = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development through adaptation ===
Development through adaptation is a way to compromise with the problems and obstacles in complex systems. As time goes by, the environment will change and it needs adaptation in order to develop continuously. To develop through adaption, something experiences different stages. For example, the mobile phone has gone through quite a few adaptations in its evolutionary development from the past. When it first released, the size of a mobile phone was enormous, but as they passed through generations of development phone became smaller. The development of mobile data from 1G to 4G made using phones faster and more convenient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G: The evolution of wireless generations|url = http://www.phonearena.com/news/1G-2G-3G-4G-The-evolution-of-wireless-generations_id46952|website = Phone Arena|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; To sum up, this refers to the process of creating diverse and innovative ideas and choices for the enterprise and selecting the one that will be most successful for the next generation.

=== Strategic technical planning ===
{{See also|Strategic technology plan}}
Strategic technical planning (STP) gives the enterprise the picture of their aim and objectives in the future and also an assessment on the process of organization. It brings a balance of assimilation and modernization to the enterprise. It has different components for STP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Oldid|page=Strategic Technology Plan|oldid=676805166|label=Strategic Technology Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is strategic planning? - Definition from WhatIs.com|url = http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/strategic-planning|website = SearchCIO|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enterprise governance ===
It is defined as 'The set of responsibilities and practices exercised by the board and executive management with the goal of providing strategic direction, ensuring that objectives are achieved, ascertaining that risks are managed appropriately and verifying that the organisation’s resources are used responsibly.' according to (CIMA Official Terminology, 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cimaglobal.com/Documents/ImportedDocuments/cid_enterprise_governance__feb08.pdf.pdf|title = Enterprise Governance|date = June 2007|accessdate = 2015-11-02|website = |publisher = CIMA|last = Lees|first = Gillian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enterprise governance includes two aspects which are corporate governance (conformance) and business governance (performance). It is essential to understand the company and to know what must be done in order to succeed. It allows us to make the right decision on the choice of CEO and executives for the company, and also to identify the risks of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.cimaglobal.com/Documents/ImportedDocuments/tech_dispap_enterprise_governance_2004.pdf|title = Enterprise Governance – A CIMA discussion paper|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-02|website = |publisher = CIMA|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processes ==
There are four different steps in the Enterprise system engineering process. It includes technology planning (TP), capabilities-based engineering analysis (CBEA), enterprise architecture (EA) and enterprise analysis and assessment (EA&amp;A).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1109/SYSTEMS.2007.374650 |chapter=Findings of Case Studies in Enterprise Systems Engineering |title=2007 1st Annual IEEE Systems Conference |pages=1–6 |year=2007 |last1=Crider |first1=Kimberly A. |last2=Derosa |first2=Joseph K. |isbn=1-4244-1040-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joannou 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1109/mc.2007.167 |title=Enterprise, Systems, and Software Engineering--The Need for Integration |journal=Computer |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=103–5 |year=2007 |last1=Joannou |first1=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology planning ===
It is a step that searching and looking for key technologies for the enterprise. The aim of this step is to determine and associate all the innovative ideas and choose the technology that are useful for the enterprise to develop in a sustainable way.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

==== Technology needs ====
We have to identify and look for the trend of the technology to decide what technology the company needs. It is important to understand what each of the technology can be achieved and will the characteristic of the technology fits in the company well. There are loads of technology-based decision need to be taken by the company such as deciding which computers to use, which software is suitable and useful for the company, how to build up a system to back up all the customer data or essential statistics for the company with high security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = (NetAction)|url = http://www.netaction.org/training/part6.html|website = www.netaction.org|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Capabilities-based engineering analysis ===
It is an analysis method that focus on the essential elements that whole enterprise needs. It is a scheme that target the innovation and evolution of the capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.necsi.edu/events/iccs6/papers/edf44ffdca28da54ce6f97271c81.pdf|title = Capabilities-Based Engineering  Analysis (CBEA)|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-02|website = |publisher = The MITRE Corporation|last = Webb|first = Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There is a set of essential steps for the analysis. The activities are dependent and it is conducted iteratively.

==== Purpose formulation ====
* Assess Stakeholders Interest – To understand what the stakeholders want and like
* Specify Outcome Spaces – To find solutions for several conditions and the goal for the operations
* Frame [[Capability (systems engineering)|Capability]] Portfolios - To collect all the fundamental elements

==== Exploratory analysis ====
* Assess Performance and Cost – To identify the performance and cost in different conditions and find solutions to improve
* Explore concepts – To search for new concepts and transform advanced capabilities
* Determine the need for more variety – To examine the risks and chances and decide whether new ways are needed

==== Evolutionary planning ====
* Assess Enterprise Impacts – To investigate the effects on the enterprise in technical and [[Capability (systems engineering)|capability]] aspects
* Examine Evolution Strategies – To explore and construct more strategies and evolution route
* Develop Capability Road map – Road map is a plan for the capability area which includes analysis and decision making which is a tool for assessment and development for the enterprise

=== Enterprise architecture ===
[[File:Enterprise Architecture Domain Reference Architecture.JPG|thumb|300x300px|The prospective of Enterprise Architecture]]
It is a model that illustrates the vision, network and framework of an organization. There are four aspects according to Microsoft's Michael Platt which are the prospective of business, application, information and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is enterprise architecture (EA)? - Definition from WhatIs.com|url = http://searchcio.techtarget.com/definition/enterprise-architecture|website = SearchCIO|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagram beside shows that structure of the Enterprise Architecture. The benefits of this step are improvement of the decision making for enterprise, increases the efficiency on the IT aspects and also minimize the loss of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Enterprise Architecture {{!}} Centric|url = http://centricconsulting.com/technology-solutions/it-strategy/enterprise-architecture/|website = Centric Consulting|accessdate = 2015-11-02|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Business – The strategies and process by the operation of business
* Application – Interaction and communication along with the process used in the company
* Information – The logical data and statistics that the organization required to run properly and actively
* Technology – The software and hardware and different operation systems that used in the company
All the elements are dependent and rely on each other in order to build the infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DTS Enterprise Architecture|url = http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/dts/architecture/index.html|website = www.montgomerycountymd.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Enterprise analysis and assessment ===
Enterprise analysis and assessment aim to find out if the enterprise is going to the right direction and help to do the correct decisions for the organization. It is strong advise to link with enterprise opportunity and risk assessment. There are also qualities that are required for this step such as aware of the suitable and capable technologies, to know and understand about C2 (Command and Control) issues and also the background picture of Modeling and simulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.necsi.edu/events/iccs6/papers/a95cd8d8b7238a89aed673ea78de.pdf|title = Enterprise Analysis and Assessment  of Complex Military Command and  Control Environments|date = 2006|accessdate = 2015-11-03|website = |publisher = The MITRE Corporation|last = Roberts|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various activities and actions for this event.
# Multi-scale analysis
# Early and continuous war fighter operational assessment
# Lightweight, portable M&amp;S-based C2 capability representations
# Developmental software versions available for assessment
# Minimal infrastructure
# Flexible modeling and simulation (M&amp;S), operator-in-the-loop (OITL), and hardware-in-the-loop (HWIL) capabilities
# In-line, continuous performance monitoring and selective forensics.

== Traditional systems engineering (TSE) ==
TSE refers to traditional systems engineering, which is a term to be defined as an engineering sub-system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Model-oriented systems engineering science : a unifying framework for traditional and complex systems|last = Hybertson|first = Duane|publisher = Boca Raton ; London : CRC Press|year = 2009|isbn = 9781420072518|location = |pages = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/pdf/05_1483.pdf|title = Enterprise Systems Engineering Theory and Practice  Volume 2:  Systems Thinking for the Enterprise:  New and Emerging Perspectives|date = November 2005|accessdate = 2015-11-03|website = |publisher = The MITRE Corporation|last = Rebovich|first = George}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== TSE ===
* TSE is composed and constructed by external designer
* It is a stable system which it won't change automatically
* Operation and development are independent with each other
* Most of the components exclude people which therefore people do not play an important role in it
* There are massive machines which have expected conduct
There are differences between TSE and ESE. There are survey results comparing both of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.necsi.edu/events/iccs6/papers/61396b8e80744893d87e811e19b8.pdf|title = On the Pursuit of Enterprise  Systems Engineering Ideas|date = |accessdate = 2015-11-03|website = |publisher = The MITRE Corporation|last = White|first = Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey result shown that TSE and ESE is complementary and interdependent with each other which ESE has a higher rating while TSE could also be a hidden element for ESE. So the combination of TSE and ESE will be ideal for an enterprise in this generation.

== Applications ==
There are two types of ESE application: Information Enterprise Systems Engineering and Social Enterprise Systems Engineering.

=== Information Enterprise Systems Engineering (IESE) ===
It is a system that builds up to meet the requirements and expectations of different stakeholders in the organization. There must be an input device to collect the information and output device to satisfy the information needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Enterprise Information Systems Engineering: The MERODE Approach|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QvuSBAAAQBAJ|publisher = Springer|date = 2014-09-20|isbn = 9783319101453|first = Monique|last = Snoeck|page = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three different aspects for the framework of IESE
# Functional View
# Topology View
# Physical View
Also, there are different rules for the IESE model.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolaidou, M. and Alexopoulou, N. (2007). ''Enterprise Information System Engineering: A Model-based Approach  based on the Zachman Framework''. 1st ed. [pdf] Department of Informatics &amp; Telecommunications, University of Athens, Athens, Greece: arokopio University of Athens, Athens, Greece, pp.1-10. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings/hicss/2008/3075/00/30750399.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 3 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Interchangeable point of view
* Detailed views and well displayed. Showing the specific method, solution and techniques
* Consistent views
* Supported viewpoints

=== Social Enterprise System Engineering ===
This is a framework that involves planning, analyzing, mapping and drawing a network of the process for enterprises and stakeholders. Moreover, it creates social value for entrepreneurship and explores and focuses on the social and societal issues. It forms a connection between social enterprise and system engineering. There is a Social Enterprise Systems Engineering V-model, in which two or more social elements are established based on the system engineering framework—for example, more social interface analysis that reviews stakeholders' requirements, and more activities and interactions between stakeholders to exchange opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.procs.2015.03.067 |title=Social Enterprise Systems Engineering |journal=Procedia Computer Science |volume=44 |pages=135–46 |year=2015 |last1=Mason |first1=James }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opportunity and risk management ==
There are opportunities and risks in ESE and they have to be aggressive in seeking opportunities and also finding ways to avoid or minimize the risks. Opportunity is a trigger element that may lead to the accomplishment of objectives. Risk is a potential occurrence and will affect the performance of the entire system.&lt;ref&gt;White, B. (2006). ''Enterprise Opportunity and Risk''. 1st ed. [pdf] 202 Burlington Road  Bedford, MA: INCOSE, pp.3-6. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/pdf/05_1262.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 3 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;  There are several reasons for the importance of risk management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Advanced Risk Analysis in Engineering Enterprise Systems|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1FXRBQAAQBAJ|publisher = CRC Press|date = 2012-10-08|isbn = 9781439826157|first = Cesar Ariel|last = Pinto|first2 = Paul R.|last2 = Garvey|pages = 6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# To identify the risks before head which can prepare actions to prevent or minimize the risks
# Since risks can cost the enterprise, determining the risk events can reduce the amount of loss
# Help to know how to allocate the human or technology resources in order avoid the most critical risks
There are few steps in Enterprise risk and opportunity Management Process
* Prepare the risk and opportunity plan – Select team and representatives
* Identify Risks – Complete risks statements for each risk
* Identify Opportunities – People that work at tactical level and manager must understand the opportunities in order to take a further action
* Evaluate the Enterprise Risks and Opportunities – To decide which is more critical and vital
* Develop the plan – Develop after identification and evaluation with different strategies

'''Epimorphosis''' is defined as the [[Regeneration (biology)|regeneration]] of a specific part of an organism in a way that involves extensive cell proliferation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/epimorphosis|title=Medical Definition of EPIMORPHOSIS|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[blastema]] formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yokoyama H | title = Initiation of limb regeneration: the critical steps for regenerative capacity | journal = Development, Growth &amp; Differentiation | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 13–22 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17986260 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-169X.2007.00973.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epimorphosis can be considered a simple model for [[Developmental biology|development]], though it only occurs in tissues surrounding the site of injury rather than occurring system-wide.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal  | vauthors = Kubo T, Arai T | date = September 1996|title=Insect Lectins and Epimorphosis|url=https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/tigg1989/8/43/8_43_357/_pdf/-char/en|journal=Trends in Glycoscience and Glycotechnology|publisher=Japanese Society of Carbohydrate Research|volume=8|issue=43|pages=357–364}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Epimorphosis ==
[[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], an evolutionary biologist who also worked with embryology, argued that limb and tissue reformation bore many similarities to embryonic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sunderland ME | title = Regeneration: Thomas Hunt Morgan's window into development | journal = Journal of the History of Biology | volume = 43 | issue = 2 | pages = 325–61 | date = 2010-05-01 | pmid = 20665231 | doi = 10.1007/s10739-009-9203-2 | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10739-009-9203-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Building off of the work of German embryologist [[Wilhelm Roux]], who suggested regeneration was two cooperative but distinct pathways instead of one, Morgan named the two parts of the regenerative process epimorphosis and [[morphallaxis]]. Specifically, Morgan wanted epimorphosis to specify the process of entirely new tissues being regrown from an amputation or similar injury, with morphallaxis being coined to describe regeneration that did not use [[cell proliferation]], such as in [[Hydrozoa|hydra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/thomas-hunt-morgans-definition-regeneration-morphallaxis-and-epimorphosis | title = Thomas Hunt Morgan's Definition of Regeneration: Morphallaxis and Epimorphosis | work = The Embryo Project Encyclopedia | access-date = 2018-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epimorphosis in vertebrates==
[[File:Limb bud diagram.jpg|thumb|The [[apical ectodermal ridge]] in embryonic development is very similar to the [[apical ectodermal cap]] in limb regeneration. The [[progress zone]] can be seen near to the [[zone of polarizing activity]], which instructs cells on how to orient the limb.&lt;ref name="Summerbell_1973"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Summerbell D, Lewis JH, Wolpert L | title = Positional information in chick limb morphogenesis | journal = Nature | volume = 244 | issue = 5417 | pages = 492–6 | date = August 1973 | pmid = 4621272 | doi = 10.1038/244492a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|left|381x381px]][[File:The elements of experimental embryology (1963) (21260217591).jpg|alt=Dorsal and ventral views of a newt that has had a limb amputated and regrown.|thumb|Dorsal and ventral views of a newt that has had a limb amputated and regrown, from "The elements of experimental embryology"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://archive.org/details/elementsofexperi00huxl | title = The Elements of Experimental Embryology | last = Huxley | first = Julian | last2 = De Beer | first2 = Gavin | name-list-format = vanc | date=1963| location = New York | publisher = Hafner Pub. Co. }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Julian Huxley]] and [[Gavin de Beer]]. 
|306x306px]]In [[vertebrate]]s, epimorphosis relies on blastema formation to [[Wound healing|proliferate]] cells into the new tissue. Through studies involving [[zebrafish]] fins, the toetips of mice, and limb regeneration in [[axolotl]]s, researchers at the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] found evidence for epimorphosis occurring in a variety of vertebrates, including instances of mammal epimorphosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Animal models for the study of human disease | last = Conn | first = P. Michael | name-list-format = vanc | isbn = 978-0-12-809699-4 | edition = Second | location = London, United Kingdom | oclc = 992170104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Salamanders===
Epidermal cells at the wound margins migrate to cover the wound and will become the wound epidermis.&lt;ref name="dev bio text"&gt;{{cite book | first = Scott F. | last = Gilbert | name-list-format = vanc | title = Developmental Biology | edition = Tenth | publisher = Sinauer Associates, Inc. | location = Sunderland, MA, USA | year = 2014 | pages = 571–573 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No scar tissue forms, as it would in mammals.

An [[apical ectodermal cap (AEC)]] forms on the tip of the stump.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Issues in Biological, Biochemical, and Evolutionary Sciences Research | publisher = ScholarlyEditions | year = 2012 | isbn = | location=Atlanta, GA|pages=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the embryonic [[apical ectodermal ridge]], which forms during normal [[limb development]].  The AEC causes the [[apical ectodermal ridge|progress zone]] to re-establish; this means the cells under the AEC [[Dedifferentiation|dedifferentiate]] and become [[mesenchyme|mesenchymal]].  The AEC releases [[fibroblast growth factor]]s (FGFs) (including [[FGF4|FGF-4]] and [[FGF8|-8]]) that drive the development of the new limb, essentially resetting the limb back to its embryonic development stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nye|first=Holly L.D.|last2=Cameron|first2=Jo Ann|last3=Chernoff|first3=Ellen A.G.|last4=Stocum|first4=David L.|title=Regeneration of the urodele limb: A review|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/dvdy.10236|journal=Developmental Dynamics|volume=226|issue=2|pages=280–294|doi=10.1002/dvdy.10236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, even though some of the limb cells are able to dedifferentiate, they are not able to fully dedifferentiate to the level of [[multipotent]] progenitor cells. During regeneration, only cartilage cells can form new cartilage tissue, only muscle cells can form new muscle tissue, and so on. The dedifferentiated cells still retain their original [[cell fate determination|specification]].&lt;ref name="dev bio text"/&gt;

== Epimorphosis in invertebrates ==

=== ''Periplaneta americana'' ===
The [[American cockroach]] is capable of regenerating limbs that have been damaged or destroyed, such as legs and antennae, as well parts of its compound eye. It does this with [[lectin]]—a protein made for binding proteins—named [[regenectin]], which shares a family with other [[Lipopolysaccharide binding protein|lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding proteins]]. Regenectin carries both a regenerative and a system defense function, and it is produced by the cockroach's [[Paracrine signalling|paracrine system]] to work with muscle reformation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== ''Capitella teleta'' ===
[[Capitella teleta|''C. teleta'']] is a segmented worm found in North America that is capable of regenerating posterior segments after amputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fröbius|first=Andreas C.|last2=Matus|first2=David Q.|last3=Seaver|first3=Elaine C.|date=2008-12-23|title=Genomic Organization and Expression Demonstrate Spatial and Temporal Hox Gene Colinearity in the Lophotrochozoan Capitella sp. I|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0004004|journal=PLOS One|language=en|volume=3|issue=12|pages=e4004|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0004004|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; This regeneration uses the interaction of several sets of ''[[Hox gene|Hox]]'' genes, as well as blastema formation. All of the ''Hox'' genes concerned in epimorphosis are present in the abdominal area of the worm, but not in the anterior portion. However, the genes do not, themselves, direct the anterior-posterior patterning of the worm's thorax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de Jong DM, Seaver EC | title = A Stable Thoracic Hox Code and Epimorphosis Characterize Posterior Regeneration in Capitella teleta | journal = PLOS One | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = e0149724 | date = 2016-02-19 | pmid = 26894631 | pmc = 4764619 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0149724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Planaria vitta'' ===
[[Planaria vitta|''P. vitta'']] is a [[flatworm]] of genus ''[[Planaria]]'' that, when needed, can draw upon both morphallaxis and epimorphosis to regrow itself; in ''P. vitta,'' epimorphosis precedes morphallaxis and lasts about ten days. The [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] contracts immediately after the worm is cut at the head, which activates [[totipotent]] regenerative cells, and [[rhabdite]]s gather on the epidermis. Near the time the eye-spots on the worm begin to take form, epimorphosis begins to shift over to morphallaxis, which then finishes regrowth into a complete individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pedersen|first=K. J.|date=1958|title=Morphogenetic Activities during Planarian Regeneration as influenced by Triethylene Melamine|url=http://dev.biologists.org/content/6/2/308|journal=Development|publisher=The Company of Biologists|volume=6|issue=2|pages=308–334|eissn=1477-9129|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5251">'''Gary Alfred Tomlinson''' (born December 4, 1951) is an American [[musicologist]] and the John Hay Whitney Professor of Music and Humanities at [[Yale University]]. He was formerly the Annenberg Professor in the Humanities at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sas.upenn.edu/music/faculty/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], with a Ph.D., in 1979 with thesis titled ''Rinuccini, Peri, Monteverdi, and the humanist heritage of opera''.

Tomlinson became Director of the Whitney Humanities Center, Yale University, in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Musicologist and cultural theorist Tomlinson named director of Whitney Humanities Center|url=http://news.yale.edu/2012/04/23/musicologist-and-cultural-theorist-tomlinson-named-director-whitney-humanities-center|website=YaleNews|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomlinson's research has ranged across diverse fields, including the history of opera, early-modern European musical thought and practice, the musical cultures of indigenous American societies, and the philosophy of history and critical theory.  His latest research concerns music, culture, and human evolution.  Here he is concerned to reshape the relations of evolutionary theory, archaeology, and humanistic theory so as to offer a novel model of the emergence of human modernity.  The chief ingredients of his model are the niche-construction theory of biologists' extended evolutionary synthesis, a growing systematization of culture evident in the archaeological record, and an extended semiotics indebted to Charles Sanders Peirce.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35984">'''Global commons''' is a term typically used to describe international, supranational, and global [[natural resources|resource]] domains in which [[common-pool resource]]s are found. Global [[commons]] include the earth's shared natural resources, such as the high [[World ocean|oceans]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] and [[outer space]] and the [[Antarctic]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unep.org/delc/GlobalCommons/tabid/54404/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cyberspace]] may also meet the definition of a global commons.

==Definition and usage==
"Global commons" is a term typically used to describe [[international]], [[supranational]], and global resource domains in which common-pool resources are found. In [[economics]], [[Common good (economics)|common goods]] are [[Rivalry (economics)|rivalrous]] and [[Excludability|non-excludable]], constituting one of the four main types of [[Good (economics)|goods]].&lt;ref&gt;For current definitions of public goods see any mainstream microeconomics textbook, e.g.: Hal R. Varian, ''Microeconomic Analysis'' {{ISBN|0-393-95735-7}}; [[Andreu Mas-Colell|Mas-Colell]], Whinston &amp; Green,  ''Microeconomic Theory'' {{ISBN|0-19-507340-1}}; or Gravelle &amp; Rees, ''Microeconomics'' {{ISBN|0-582-40487-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[common-pool resource]], also called a common property resource, is a special case of a common good (or [[public good]]) whose size or characteristics makes it costly, but not impossible, to exclude potential users.  Examples include both natural or human-made resource domains (e.g., a "fishing hole" or an irrigation system). Unlike [[global public good]]s, global common-pool resources face problems of congestion, overuse, or degradation because they are subtractable (which makes them [[rivalrous]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ostrom |first=Elinor |title=Governing the Commons: The Evolution of Institutions for Collective Action |year=1990 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=0 521 40599 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "commons" originates from the term [[common land]] in the British Isles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=neeson |first=Jeanette M. |last=Neeson |title=Commoners: Common Right, Enclosure and Social Change in England, 1700–1820 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK |year=1996 |ISBN=978-0521567749}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Commoners rights" referred to traditional rights held by commoners, such as [[mowing]] [[meadow]]s for [[hay]] or [[grazing]] [[livestock]] on common land held in the [[open field system]] of old [[English common law]].  [[Enclosure]] was the process that ended those traditional rights, converting open fields to [[private property]].  Today, many commons still exist in [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and the [[United States]], although their extent is much reduced from the millions of acres that existed until the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;*{{citation |last=Callander |first=Robin Fraser |year=1987 |title=A pattern of Landownership in Scotland: With Particular Reference to Aberdeenshire |place=Finzean |publisher=Haughend |oclc=60041593}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There are still over 7,000 registered commons in England alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/218756/common-land.xls DEFRA Database of registered common land in England] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129020728/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/218756/common-land.xls |date=2014-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "global commons" is typically used to indicate the earth's shared natural resources, such as the deep [[World ocean|oceans]], the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]], [[outer space]] and the Northern and Southern [[polar region]]s, the [[Antarctic]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Handbook of Global Environmental Politics (2nd edition) |publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing |location=Cheltenham, UK |author=Dauvergne, Peter (ed.) |year=2012 |isbn=978-1849809405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''World Conservation Strategy'', a report on conservation published by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources]] (IUCN) in collaboration with [[UNESCO]] and with the support of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF):
{{quote|"A commons is  a tract of land or water owned or used jointly by the members of a community. The global commons includes those parts of the Earth's surface beyond [[Jurisdiction#National|national jurisdictions]]&amp;nbsp;— notably the open ocean and the living resources found there&amp;nbsp;— or held in common&amp;nbsp;— notably the atmosphere. The only landmass that may be regarded as part of the global commons is Antarctica ..."&lt;ref name="WCS"&gt;[http://data.iucn.org/dbtw-wpd/edocs/WCS-004.pdf " Chapter 18, The global commons." ''World Conservation Strategy'', International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, accessed 22 May 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Today, the [[Internet]], [[World Wide Web]] and resulting [[cyberspace]] are often referred to as global commons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cigionline.org/publications/2012/10/internet-global-commons Raymond, Mark (2012). "The Internet as a Global Commons?" ''Governing the Internet: Chaos, Control or Consensus?'' The Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI).]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other usages sometimes include references to open access information of all kinds, including arts and culture, language and science, though these are more formally referred to as the [[common heritage of mankind]].&lt;ref&gt;Baslar, Kemal (1998). ''The Concept of the Common Heritage of Mankind in International Law''. Martinus Nijhoff Pubs. {{ISBN|978-90-411-0505-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management of the global commons==
The key challenge of the global commons is the design of governance structures and management systems capable of addressing the complexity of multiple public and private interests, subject to often unpredictable changes, ranging from the local to the global level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Global Environmental Commons: Analytical and Political Challenges in Building Governance Mechanisms |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Brousseau, Eric |year=2012 |location=Cambridge, UK |isbn=978-0199656202 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with global public goods, management of the global commons requires pluralistic legal entities, usually international and supranational, public and private, structured to match the diversity of interests and the type of resource to be managed, and stringent enough with adequate incentives to ensure compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=International Law and Global Public Goods in a Legal Pluralist World |author=Shaffer, Gregory |journal=European Journal of International Law |date=August 2012 |volume=23 |issue=3 |pages=669–693 |doi=10.1093/ejil/chs036}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such management systems are necessary to avoid, at the global level, the classic [[tragedy of the commons]], in which common resources become [[overexploited]].&lt;ref name=hardin68&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.162.3859.1243 |title=The Tragedy of the Commons |year=1968 |journal=Science |volume=162 |issue=3859 |pages=1243–1248 |pmid=5699198 |bibcode=1968Sci...162.1243H}} Also available here [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/162/3859/1243.pdf] and [http://www.garretthardinsociety.org/articles/art_tragedy_of_the_commons.html here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several key differences in management of resources in the global commons from those of the commons, in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.thecommonsjournal.org/index.php/ijc/article/view/305/229 |title=Design principles for global commons: natural resources and emerging technologies |author=Stern, Paul C |journal=International Journal of the Commons |volume=5 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are obvious differences in scale of both the resources and the number of users at the local versus the global level.  Also, there are differences in the shared culture and expectations of resource users; more localized commons users tend to be more homogeneous and global users more heterogeneous. This contributes to differences in the possibility and time it takes for new learning about resource usage to occur at the different levels. Moreover, global resource pools are less likely to be relatively stable and the dynamics are less easily understood. Many of the global commons are non-renewable on human time scales. Thus, resource degradation is more likely to be the result of [[unintended consequences]] that are unforeseen, not immediately observable, or not easily understood. For example, the [[carbon dioxide emissions]] that drive [[climate change]] continue to do so for at least a millennium after they enter the atmosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Irreversible Climate Change Due to Carbon Dioxide Emissions. |author=Solomon, S. |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] |year=2009 |volume=106 |issue=6 |pages=1704–1709 |bibcode=2009PNAS..106.1704S |doi=10.1073/pnas.0812721106 |pmid=19179281 |pmc=2632717 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and species extinctions last forever.  Importantly, because there are significant differences in the benefits, costs, and interests at the global level, there are significant differences in [[externalities]] between more local resource uses and uses of global-level resources.

Several [[environmental protocol]]s have been established (see [[List of international environmental agreements]]) as a type of [[international law]], "an intergovernmental document intended as legally binding with a primary stated purpose of preventing or managing human impacts on natural resources."&lt;ref&gt;Kanie, Norichike (2007). "Governance with Multi-lateral Environmental Agreements: A healthy or ill-equipped fragmentation?" ''Global Environmental Governance: Perspectives on the Current Debate'', Walter Hoffmann and Lydia Swart (eds.): 67-86. New York: Center for UN Reform Education.&lt;/ref&gt; International environmental protocols came to feature in [[environmental governance]] after trans-boundary [[pollution|environmental problems]] became widely perceived in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Haas"&gt;Haas, Keohane and Levy (1993). ''Institutions for the Earth: Sources of effective international environmental protection.'' Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Intergovernmental Conference]] in 1972, creation of international environmental agreements proliferated.&lt;ref name="zurn"&gt;Zürn, Michael (1998). "The Rise of International Environmental Politics: A Review of Current Research."  ''World Politics'', 50(4):617-649.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the barriers already discussed, environmental protocols are not a panacea for global commons issues.  Often, they are slow to produce the desired effects, tend to the [[lowest common denominator]], and lack monitoring and enforcement. They also take an incremental approach to solutions where [[sustainable development]] principles suggest that environmental concerns should be mainstream political issues.

===The global ocean===
{{Main article|World ocean|Water cycle}}

The global or [[world ocean]], as the interconnected system of the [[Earth]]'s [[ocean]]ic (or [[Marine (ocean)|marine]]) [[water]]s that comprise the bulk of the [[hydrosphere]], is a classic global commons.  It is divided into a number of principal oceanic areas that are delimited by the [[continent]]s and various oceanographic features.  In turn, oceanic waters are interspersed by many smaller seas, gulfs, and bays.  Further, most freshwater bodies ultimately empty into the ocean and are derived through the Earth's [[water cycle]] from ocean waters.  The [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea|Law of the Sea]] is a body of [[public international law]] governing relationships between nations in respect to navigational rights, [[mineral rights]], and jurisdiction over coastal waters.  Maritime law, also called [[Admiralty law]], is a body of both domestic law governing maritime activities and [[Conflict of laws|private international law]] governing the relationships between private entities which operate vessels on the oceans. It deals with matters including marine commerce, [[marine navigation]], [[shipping]], [[sailor]]s, and the transportation of passengers and goods by sea. However, these bodies of law do little to nothing to protect deep oceans from human threats.

In addition to providing significant means of transportation, a large proportion of all [[life]] on Earth exists in its ocean, which contains about 300 times the habitable volume of terrestrial habitats.  Specific marine habitats include [[coral reef]]s, [[kelp forest]]s, [[seagrass meadow]]s, [[tidepool]]s, muddy, sandy and rocky bottoms, and the open ocean ([[pelagic]]) zone, where solid objects are rare and the surface of the water is the only visible boundary. The organisms studied range from microscopic [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] to huge [[cetaceans]] (whales) 30 [[meters]] (98 [[foot (length)|feet]]) in length.

At a fundamental level, marine life helps determine the very nature of our planet. Marine life resources provide food (especially [[fishery|food fish]]), medicines, and raw materials. It is also becoming understood that the well-being of marine organisms and other organisms are linked in very fundamental ways. The human body of knowledge regarding the relationship between life in the sea and important cycles is rapidly growing, with new discoveries being made nearly every day. These cycles include those of matter (such as the [[carbon cycle]]) and of air (such as [[Global climate model|Earth's respiration]], and movement of energy through [[ecosystem]]s including the ocean). Marine organisms contribute significantly to the [[oxygen cycle]], and are involved in the regulation of the Earth's [[climate]].&lt;ref name="DMS"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/hm3h1q666x206h46 |title=Planktonic dimethylsulfide and cloud albedo: An estimate of the feedback response |author=Foley, Jonathan A., Karl E.

The United Nations Environment Programme ([[UNEP]]) has identified several areas of need in managing the global ocean: strengthen national capacities for action, especially in developing countries; improve fisheries management;     reinforce cooperation in semi-enclosed and regional seas; strengthen controls over ocean disposal of hazardous and nuclear wastes; and advance the Law of the Sea. Specific problems identified as in need of attention include [[Current sea level rise|rising sea levels]]; [[Marine pollution|contamination]] by hazardours chemicals (including oil spills); microbiological contamination; ocean acidification; [[Algal bloom#Harmful algal blooms|harmful algal blooms]]; and [[over-fishing]] and other [[overexploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.unep.org/geo/geo4/report/10_Placing_Environment_at_the_Core.pdf |title=Global environment outlook: environment for development (GEO4) |publisher=World Commission on Environment and Development, The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). |authorlink=Section F,  Chapter 10: From the Periphery to the Core of Decision Making – Options for Action |year=2007 |isbn=978-9280728361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]] Environmental Initiative program has identified a need for a worldwide system of very large, highly protected marine reserves where fishing and other extractive activities are prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewenvironment.org/campaigns/global-ocean-legacy/id/8589941025 |title=Global Ocean Legacy |publisher=Environmental Initiative, Pew Charitable Trusts |accessdate=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atmosphere===
{{Main article|Air pollution|Climate change|Global warming}}

The atmosphere is a complex dynamic natural gaseous system that is essential to support life on planet Earth. A primary concern for management of the global atmosphere is [[air pollution]], the introduction into the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] of [[chemical]]s, [[particulates]], or [[biomolecule|biological materials]] that cause discomfort, disease, or death to humans, damage other living organisms such as food crops, or damage the [[natural environment]] or [[built environment]]. [[Stratosphere|Stratospheric]] [[ozone depletion]] due to air pollution has long been recognized as a threat to human health as well as to the Earth's [[ecosystems]].

Pollution of breathable [[Air pollution|air]] is a central problem in the management of the global commons. Pollutants can be in the form of solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases and may be natural or man-made.  Although controversial and limited in scope by methods of enforcement, in several parts of the world the [[polluter pays principle]], which makes the [[Party (law)|party]] responsible for producing [[pollution]] responsible for paying for the damage done to the [[natural environment]], is accepted. It has strong support in most [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) and [[European Community]] (EC) countries. It is also known as extended producer responsibility (EPR). EPR seeks to shift the responsibility dealing with waste from [[government]]s (and thus, [[taxpayer]]s and society at large) to the entities producing it. In effect, it attempts to internalise the cost of waste disposal into the cost of the product, theoretically resulting in producers improving the [[Waste management|waste profile]] of their products, decreasing waste and increasing possibilities for [[reuse]] and [[recycling]].

The 1979 [[Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]], or CLRTAP, is an early international effort to protect and gradually reduce and prevent air pollution. It is implemented by the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP), directed by the [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE).  The [[Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer]], or Montreal Protocol (a protocol to the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]]), is an international [[treaty]] designed to protect the [[ozone layer]] by phasing out the production of numerous substances believed to be responsible for [[ozone depletion]]. The treaty was opened for signature on 16 September 1987, and entered into force on 1 January 1989.

[[Global dimming]] is the gradual reduction in the amount of global direct [[irradiance]] at the [[Earth]]'s surface, which has been observed for several decades after the start of systematic measurements in the 1950s. Global dimming is thought to have been caused by an increase in [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]] such as [[sulfate aerosol]]s in the atmosphere due to human action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-chapter7.pdf |title=Couplings between changes in Climate System and the Biogeochemistry, 7.5.3 |author1=Keneth L. Denman |author2=Guy Brasseur |publisher=IPCC |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-04-09 |format=PDF |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has interfered with the  [[hydrological cycle]] by reducing evaporation and may have reduced rainfall in some areas. Global dimming also creates a [[global cooling|cooling]] effect that may have partially masked the effect of [[greenhouse gas]]es on [[global warming]].

Along with global warming, generalized [[climate change]] is an ongoing global commons concern.  Although global warming is now a generally accepted scientific observation, the precise causes of global warming are still a matter of research and debate. The [[Kyoto Protocol]] to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) is an international environmental treaty that sets binding obligations on industrialised countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and prevent potentially harmful anthropogenic (i.e., human-induced) interference in the climate system.&lt;ref name="unfccc2005"&gt;{{cite web |title=Article 2 |work=The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. |quote=Such a level should be achieved within a time-frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner |url=http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1353.php |accessdate=15 November 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051028023600/http://unfccc.int/essential_background/convention/background/items/1353.php |archivedate=28 October 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 192 parties to the convention, including 191 states and the [[European Union]], but not all have ratified and implemented the protocol.&lt;ref name=UNamend&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=21 January 2013 |work=United Nations |url=http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-c&amp;chapter=27&amp;lang=en |title=7.c Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114190559/http://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-7-c&amp;chapter=27&amp;lang=en |archivedate=14 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polar regions===
{{Main article|Polar regions|Climate change in the Arctic|Antarctic cooling controversy}}

The eight Arctic nations  [[Canada]],  [[Denmark]] ( [[Greenland]] and the [[Faroe Islands]]),  [[Norway]], the [[United States]] ([[Alaska]]), [[Sweden]], [[Finland]],  [[Iceland]], and [[Russia]], are all members of the treaty organization, the [[Arctic Council]], as are organizations representing six [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous populations]]. The Council operates on consensus basis, mostly dealing with environmental treaties and not addressing boundary or resource disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/Depts/los/reference_files/chronological_lists_of_ratifications.htm |date=April 22, 2009 |accessdate=April 30, 2009 |title=Chronological lists of ratifications of, accessions and successions to the Convention and the related Agreements |publisher=United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414043900/http://www.un.org/depts/los/reference_files/chronological_lists_of_ratifications.htm |archivedate=14 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, the [[Antarctic Treaty]] and related agreements, collectively called the Antarctic Treaty System or ATS, regulate [[international relations]] with respect to [[Antarctica]], Earth's only continent without a native human population. The treaty, entering into force in 1961 and currently having 50 signatory nations, sets aside Antarctica as a scientific preserve, establishes freedom of scientific investigation and bans [[Military activity in the Antarctic|military activity on that continent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://polarconservation.org/education/plonearticle.2005-12-28.3597747204 |title=Information about the Antarctic Treaty and how Antarctica is governed. |accessdate=February 6, 2011 |date=December 28, 2005 |publisher=Polar Conservation Organisation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308064504/http://www.polarconservation.org/education/plonearticle.2005-12-28.3597747204 |archivedate=March 8, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change in the Arctic region is leading to widespread ecosystem restructuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Footprints of climate change in the Arctic marine ecosystem. |author=Wassmann, P. |journal=Global Change Biology |year=2011 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=1235–1249 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02311.x |display-authors=etal|bibcode=2011GCBio..17.1235W }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of species is changing along with the structure of food webs. Changes in ocean circulation appear responsible for the first exchanges of zooplankton between the North Pacific and North Atlantic regions in perhaps 800,000 years. These changes can allow the transmission of diseases from subarctic animals to Arctic ones, and vice versa, posing an additional threat to species already stressed by habitat loss and other impacts. Where these changes lead is not yet clear, but are likely to have far-reaching impacts on Arctic marine ecosystems.

===Outer space===
{{Main article|Outer space|Space law}}

Management of [[outer space]] global commons has been contentious since the successful launch of the [[Sputnik]] satellite by the former [[Soviet Union]] on 4 October 1957.  There is no clear boundary between [[Earth's atmosphere]] and space, although there are several standard boundary designations: one that deals with [[Orbital speed|orbital velocity]] (the [[Kármán line]]), one that depends on the velocity of charged particles in space, and some that are determined by human factors such as the height at which human blood begins to boil without a pressurized environment (the [[Armstrong line]]).

[[Space policy]] regarding a country's [[List of space agencies|civilian space program]], as well as its policy on both [[Militarisation of space|military use]] and [[Commercialization of space|commercial use]] of outer space, intersects with [[science policy]], since national space programs often perform or [[Funding of science|fund research]] in [[space science]], and also with [[defense policy]], for applications such as [[spy satellite]]s and [[anti-satellite weapon]]s.  It also encompasses government regulation of third-party activities such as commercial [[communications satellite]]s and [[private spaceflight]]&lt;ref name=Goldman&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldman |first=Nathan C. |title=Space Policy:An Introduction |year=1992 |publisher=Iowa State University Press |location=Ames, IA |isbn=0-8138-1024-8 |page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the creation and application of [[space law]] and [[space advocacy]] organizations that exist to support the cause of space exploration.

The [[Outer Space Treaty]] provides a basic framework for international space law. It covers the legal use of outer space by nation states. The treaty states that outer space is free for all nation states to explore and is not subject to claims of national [[sovereignty]]. It also prohibits the deployment of [[nuclear weapon]]s in outer space. The treaty was passed by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 1963 and signed in 1967 by the USSR, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. As of mid-year, 2013 the treaty has been ratified by 102 states and signed by an additional 27 states.

Beginning in 1958, outer space has been the subject of multiple resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly. Of these, more than 50 have concerned the international co-operation in the peaceful uses of outer space and preventing an arms race in space. Four additional [[space law]] treaties have been negotiated and drafted by the UN's [[United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space|Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space]]. Still, there remain no legal prohibitions against deploying conventional weapons in space and [[anti-satellite weapon]]s have been successfully tested by the US, USSR and China. The 1979 [[Moon Treaty]] turned the jurisdiction of all heavenly bodies (including the orbits around such bodies) over to the international community. However, this treaty has not been ratified by any nation that currently practices manned spaceflight.

In 1976 eight equatorial states ([[Ecuador]], [[Colombia]], [[Brazil]], [[Republic of Congo|Congo]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo|Zaire]], [[Uganda]], [[Kenya]], and [[Indonesia]]) met in [[Bogotá]], Colombia to make the "Declaration of the First Meeting of Equatorial Countries," also known as "the Bogotá Declaration", a claim to control the segment of the geosynchronous orbital path corresponding to each country. These claims are not internationally accepted.

The [[International Space Station program]]me is a joint project among five participating space agencies: [[NASA]], the [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (RSA), [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), and [[Canadian Space Agency]] (CSA). National budget constraints led to the merger of three space station projects into the [[International Space Station]]. In 1993 the partially built components for a Soviet/Russian space station [[Mir-2]], the proposed American [[Space Station Freedom|Freedom]], and the proposed European [[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]] merged into this multinational programme.&lt;ref name="ISSBook"&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0387781440 |date=17 June 2008 |publisher=Springer-Praxis |author=John E. Catchpole |title=The International Space Station: Building for the Future}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements. The ISS is arguably the most expensive single item ever constructed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historical.whatitcosts.com/facts-space-station.htm|title=How Much the International Space Station (ISS) Cost to Build|author=|date=14 April 2016|website=whatitcosts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be one of the most significant instances of international cooperation in modern history.

According to the original Memorandum of Understanding between NASA and the RSA, the International Space Station was intended to be a laboratory, observatory and factory in space. It was also planned to provide transportation, maintenance, and act as a staging base for possible future missions to the Moon, Mars and asteroids. In the 2010 United States National Space Policy, it was given additional roles of serving commercial, diplomatic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Payette |first=Julie |title=Research and Diplomacy 350 Kilometers above the Earth: Lessons from the International Space Station |journal=Science &amp; Diplomacy |date=10 December 2012 |volume=1 |issue=4 |url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/article/2012/research-and-diplomacy-350-kilometers-above-earth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and educational purposes.&lt;ref name=USNSP&gt;{{cite web |title=National Space Policy of the United States of America |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/national_space_policy_6-28-10.pdf |publisher=White House; USA Federal government |accessdate=20 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711205103/http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/national_space_policy_6-28-10.pdf |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
{{Main article|Digital commons (economics)}}

As a global system of [[computer]]s interconnected by [[telecommunication]] technologies consisting of millions of private, public, academic, business, and government resources, it is difficult to argue that the [[Internet]] is a global commons.  These computing resources are largely privately owned and subject to [[private property]] law, although many are government owned and subject to [[public law]]. The [[World Wide Web]], as a system of interlinked [[hypertext]] documents, either [[public domain]] (like Wikipedia itself) or subject to [[copyright law]], is, at best, a mixed [[good (economics)|good]].

The resultant [[Virtuality|virtual]] space or [[cyberspace]], however, is often viewed as an electronic global commons that allows for as much or more [[freedom of expression]] as any [[public space]]. Access to those [[Digital commons (economics)|digital commons]] and the actual freedom of expression allowed does vary widely by geographical area.  Management of the electronic global commons presents as many issues as do other commons.  In addition to issues related to [[digital divide|inequity in access]], issues such as [[net neutrality]], [[Internet censorship]], [[Internet privacy]], and electronic [[surveillance]] arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Governance of Cyberspace: Politics, Technology and Global Restructuring |publisher=Routledge |author=Loader, Brian D |year=2004 |isbn=978-0415147248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SomaliaLuftaufnahme1993.jpg|thumb|Gullied landscape in [[Somalia]].]]
&lt;!--LEAVE THIS HERE TO AVOID BLANKINGS--&gt;
A '''gully''' is a [[landform]] created by running [[water]], [[erosion|eroding]] sharply into [[soil]], typically on a [[hill]]side. Gullies resemble large [[ditch]]es or small [[valley]]s, but are metres to tens of metres in depth and width.  When the gully formation is in process, the [[volumetric flow rate|water flow rate]] can be substantial, causing a significant deep cutting action into soil.

==Etymology==
The earliest known usage of the term is from 1657. It originates from the [[French language|French]] word ''goulet'', a diminutive form of ''goule'' which means ''throat''. It is possible that the term was derived from a type of [[knife]] at the time, a ''gully-knife'', because hills that have gullies look as if they are cut open with a sharp knife.{{cn|date=March 2015}}

== Formation and consequences ==
Gully erosion is the process by which gullies are formed. Hillsides are more prone to gully erosion when they are cleared of vegetation, through [[deforestation]], [[over-grazing]] or other means.  The eroded [[soil]] is easily carried by the flowing water after being dislodged from the ground, normally when [[rainfall]] falls during short, intense storms such as during [[thunderstorms]].

A gully may grow in length by means of [[Headward erosion|headward (i.e. upstream) erosion]] at a [[knick point]]. This erosion can result from [[interflow]] as well as [[surface runoff]].

Gullies reduce the productivity of [[Farmland (farming)|farmland]] where they incise into the land, and produce [[sediment]] that may clog downstream [[waterbodies]].  Because of this, much effort is invested into the study of gullies within the scope of [[geomorphology]], in the prevention of gully erosion, and in restoration of gullied landscapes.  The total soil loss from gully formation and subsequent downstream [[river]] [[sedimentation]] can be sizeable.

== Artificial gullies ==
Gullies can be formed or enlarged by a number of human activities. 

Artificial gullies are formed during [[hydraulic mining]] when jets or streams of water are projected onto soft [[alluvial deposits]] to extract [[gold]] or [[tin ore]]. The remains of such mining methods are very visible landform features in old [[gold mining|goldfield]]s such as in [[California]] and northern [[Spain]]. The [[badland]]s at [[Las Medulas]] for example, were created during the Roman period by [[hushing]] or [[hydraulic mining]] of the gold-rich alluvium with water supplied by numerous aqueducts tapping nearby rivers. Each [[Aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueduct]] produced large gullies below by erosion of the soft deposits. The effluvium was carefully washed with smaller streams of water to extract the [[Gold nugget|nuggets]] and gold dust.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==On Mars==
{{Main|Gully (Mars)}}

Gullies are widespread at mid- to high latitudes on the surface of [[Mars]], and are some of the youngest features observed on that planet, probably forming within the last few 100,000 years. There, they are one of the best lines of evidence for the presence of [[Water on Mars|liquid water]] on Mars in the recent geological past, probably resulting from the slight melting of snowpacks on the surface&lt;ref&gt;Christensen, PR (2003). "Formation of recent martian gullies through melting of extensive water-rich snow deposits.". Nature 422 (6927): 45–8. doi:10.1038/nature01436. {{PMID|12594459}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or ice in the shallow subsurface&lt;ref&gt;Costard, F. , Forget, F. , Mangold, N. &amp; Peulvast, J. P.

Flow as springs from deeper seated liquid water [[aquifers]] in the deeper subsurface is also a possible explanation for the formation of some Martian gullies.&lt;ref&gt;Malin M. C. and Edgett K. S.

{{Refimprove|date=November 2009}}
The '''InterPlanetary Network''' (IPN) is a group of [[spacecraft]] equipped with [[gamma ray burst]] (GRB) detectors. By [[Multilateration|timing the arrival]] of a burst at several spacecraft, its precise location can be found. The precision for determining the direction of a GRB in the sky is improved by increasing the spacing of the detectors, and also by more accurate timing of the reception. Typical spacecraft baselines of about one AU ([[astronomical unit]]) and time resolutions of tens of milliseconds can determine a burst location within several arcminutes, allowing follow-up observations with other telescopes.

==Rationale==
[[Gamma rays]] are too [[photon energy|energetic]] to be focused with mirrors. The rays penetrate mirror materials instead of reflecting. Because gamma rays cannot be focused into an image in the traditional sense, a unique location for a gamma ray source cannot be determined as it is done with less energetic light.

In addition, gamma ray bursts are brief flashes (often as little as 0.2 seconds) that occur randomly across the sky. Some forms of gamma ray telescope can generate an image, but they require longer integration times, and cover only a fraction of the sky.

Once three spacecraft detect a GRB, their timings are sent to the ground for correlation. A sky position is derived, and distributed to the astronomical community for follow-up observations with optical, radio, or spaceborne telescopes.

==Iterations of the IPN==
Note that, since any IPN must consist of several spacecraft, the boundaries between networks are defined differently by different commentators.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Spacecraft naturally join or leave service as their missions unfold, and some modern spacecraft are far more capable than prior IPN members.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===A "planetary network"===
The [[Vela (satellite)|Vela]] group of satellites was originally designed to detect covert nuclear tests, possibly at the Moon's altitude. Thus, the Velas were placed in high orbits, so that a time delay would occur between spacecraft triggers. In addition, each satellite had multiple gamma-ray detectors across their structures; the detectors facing a blast would register a higher gamma count than the detectors facing away.

A gamma-ray burst was detected by the Vela group on June 3, 1969, and thus referred to as GRB 690603. The location was determined to be clearly outside of the satellites' orbit, and probably outside of the Solar system. After reviewing archived Vela data, a previous burst was determined to have occurred on July 2, 1967. Public reports of initial GRBs were not disclosed until the early 1970s.

===Further missions===
Additional spacecraft were given gamma-ray detectors. The [[Apollo 15]] and [[Apollo 16|16]] missions carried detectors to study the Moon; middle-to-late [[Venera]] spacecraft carried detectors to Venus. The relatively long baselines of these missions again showed that bursts originated at great distances. Other spacecraft (such as the OGO, OSO, and IMP series) had detectors for Earth, Solar, or all-sky gamma radiation, and also confirmed the GRB phenomenon.

===The first true IPN===
Scientists began to tailor instruments specifically for GRBs. The [[Helios probes|Helios-2]] spacecraft carried a detector with precision time resolution to a Solar orbit that took it over one AU from Earth. Helios-2 was launched in 1976.

In 1978, multiple spacecraft were launched, forming the necessary baselines for a position determination. The [[Pioneer Venus Orbiter]] and its Soviet counterparts, [[Venera 11]] and [[Venera 12|12]], took gamma detectors to the orbit of Venus. In addition, the spacecraft Prognoz-7 and ISEE-3 remained in Earth orbit. These formed an Earth-Venus-Sun triangle, and the probes at Venus formed a smaller triangle. 84 bursts were detected, until the network degraded in 1980. The Pioneer Venus Orbiter continued until it entered the Venus atmosphere in 1992, but not enough other spacecraft were functioning to form the required baselines.

On March 5 and 6, 1979, two bursts of hard X-rays were detected from the same source in the constellation [[Dorado]] by the γ-ray burst detector [[Konus]], on the [[Venera 11]] and [[Venera 12]] spacecraft.&lt;ref name=Mazets&gt;{{ cite journal |doi=10.1038/282587a0 |vauthors=Mazets EP, Golenetskii SV, Il'inskii VN, Aptekar' RL, Guryan YA |title=Observations of a flaring X-ray pulsar in Dorado |journal=Nature |date=December 1979 |volume=282 |issue=5739 |pages=587–9 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v282/n5739/abs/282587a0.html |bibcode = 1979Natur.282..587M }}&lt;/ref&gt; These X-ray bursts were detected by several other spacecraft.&lt;ref name=Mazets/&gt; As part of the InterPlanetary Network (IPN),&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;{{cite web |author=Morgan M |title=InterPlanetary Network Progress Report |url=http://ipnpr.jpl.nasa.gov/index.cfm }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Venera 11]], [[Venera 12]] were hit by the March 5, 1979, hard X-ray burst at ~10:51 EST, followed 11 s later by [[Helios 2 (NASA)|Helios 2]] in orbit around the Sun, then the [[Pioneer Venus Orbiter]] at Venus. Seconds later the [[Vela (satellite)|Vela satellites]], Prognoz 7, and the [[Einstein Observatory]] in orbit around Earth were inundated. The last satellite hit was the [[International Cometary Explorer|ISEE-3]] before the burst exited the [[Solar System]].

===The second IPN===
Pioneer Venus Orbiter was rejoined by [[Ulysses probe|Ulysses]] in 1990. The launch of the [[Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory]] in 1991 again formed triangular baselines with PVO and Ulysses. Ulysses continued until June 2009, and the PVO mission ended in August 1992.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Compton once again brought directional discrimination with the BATSE instrument. Like the Velas, BATSE placed detectors at the spacecraft corners. Thus, Compton alone could determine a coarse burst location, to within 1.6 to 4 degrees. Baselines with other spacecraft were then used to sharpen Compton's position solutions. In addition, almost half the sky from Compton was blocked by the Earth, just as Venus blocked part of the sky for PVO. Detection or non-detection by Compton or PVO added another element to the location algorithms.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Compton also had high-precision, low-field-of-view gamma instruments. Occasionally, GRBs would occur where Compton happened to be pointing. The use of multiple, sensitive instruments would provide much more accuracy than BATSE alone.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===The "third" IPN===
Compton and Ulysses were joined briefly by [[Mars Observer]] in late 1992, before that spacecraft failed. Some feel that Compton provided sufficient continuity, and that the distinction between 2nd, 3rd, and subsequent IPNs is semantic.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

==="Additional" IPNs===
Compton and Ulysses were joined by [[WIND (spacecraft)|Wind]] in 1994. Although Wind was in Earth orbit, like Compton, its altitude was very high, thus forming a short but usable baseline. The high altitude also meant that Earth blockage was negligible. In addition, Wind carried a top and bottom detector. Interpolation between the two units usually gave a general sky direction for bursts, which in many cases could augment the IPN algorithm. The addition of [[RXTE]] in 1995 also helped. Although RXTE was an X-ray mission in Earth orbit, it could detect those gamma-ray bursts which also shone in X-rays, and give a direction (rather than merely a time trigger) for them.

Two important developments occurred in 1996. [[NEAR Shoemaker|NEAR]] was launched; its trajectory to an asteroid again formed a triangular IPN measured in AUs. The IPN was also joined by [[BeppoSAX]]. BeppoSAX had wide-field gamma detectors, and narrow-field X-ray telescopes. Once a GRB was detected, operators could spin the spacecraft within hours to point the X-ray telescopes at the coarse location. The X-ray afterglow would then give a fine location. In 1997, the first fine location allowed detailed study of a GRB and its environ.

Compton was deorbited in 2000; the NEAR mission was shut down in early 2001. In late 2001, the [[Mars Odyssey]] spacecraft again formed an interplanetary triangle.

Other members of the network include or have included the Indian [[Stretched Rohini Satellite Series#SROSS C2|SROSS-C2]] spacecraft, the US Air Force's Defense Meteorological Satellites, the Japanese [[Yohkoh]] spacecraft, and the Chinese SZ-2 mission. These have all been Earth orbiters, and the Chinese and Indian detectors were operational for only a few months.

Of all the above, Ulysses is the only spacecraft whose orbit takes it large distances away from the ecliptic plane. These deviations from the ecliptic plane allow more precise 3-D measurements of the apparent positions of the GRBs.

==The 21st century: staring spacecraft==
New techniques and designs in high-energy astronomy spacecraft are challenging the traditional operation of the IPN. Because distant probes require sensitive ground antennas for communication, they introduce a time lag into GRB studies. Large ground antennas must split time between spacecraft, rather than listen continuously for GRB notifications. Typically, GRB coordinates determined by deep space probes are distributed many hours to a day or two after the GRB. This is very frustrating for studies of events which are measured in seconds.

A new generation of spacecraft are designed to produce GRB locations on board, then relay them to the ground within minutes or even seconds. These positions are based not on time correlation, but on X-ray telescopes, as on BeppoSAX but much faster. [[High Energy Transient Explorer|HETE]]-2, launched in 2000, stares at a large region of sky. Should a GRB trigger the gamma detectors, X-ray masks report sky coordinates to ground stations. Because HETE is in a low, consistent orbit, it can use many inexpensive ground stations. There is almost always a ground station in view of the spacecraft, which reduces latency to seconds.

The [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission|Swift]] spacecraft, launched in 2004, is similar in operation but much more powerful. When a GRB triggers the gamma detectors, generating a crude position, the spacecraft spins relatively rapidly to use its focusing X-ray and optical telescopes. These refine the GRB location to within arcminutes, and often within arcseconds. The fine position is reported to the ground in approximately an hour.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[INTEGRAL]] is a successor to Compton. INTEGRAL can similarly determine a coarse position by comparing gamma counts from one side to another. It also possesses a gamma-ray telescope with an ability to determine positions to under a degree. INTEGRAL cannot pivot rapidly like the small HETE and Swift spacecraft. But should a burst happen to occur in its telescope field of view, its position and characteristics can be recorded with high precision.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

[[RHESSI]] was launched in 2002 to perform solar studies. However, its gamma instrument could detect bright gamma sources from other regions of the sky, and produce coarse positions through differential detectors. Occasionally, a GRB would appear next to the Sun, and the RHESSI instrument would determine its properties without IPN assistance.

Note however, that all these spacecraft suffer from Earth blockage to varying degrees.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Also, the more sophisticated the "staring" instrument, the lower the sky coverage. Randomly occurring GRBs are more likely to be missed, or detected at low resolution only. The use of non-directional deep space probes, such as [[MESSENGER]] and [[BepiColombo]], will continue.

==Current IPN developments==
In 2007 [[AGILE (spacecraft)|AGILE]] was launched and in 2008 the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope]] and although these are Earth orbiters, their instruments provide directional discrimination. The Fermi Space Telescope uses both wide-area burst detectors and a narrow-angle telescope, and has a limited ability to spin itself to place a GRB within the telescope field. [[MESSENGER]]'s Gamma Ray Neutron Spectrometer&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/messenger/spacecraft/index.html|title=Spacecraft and Instruments|last=Talbert|first=Tricia|date=2015-04-15|work=NASA|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  was able to add data to the IPN, before the end of MESSENGER's mission in 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Hurley |first=K. et. al |title=The Interplanetary Network Supplement to the Fermi GBM Catalog of Cosmic Gamma-Ray Bursts |date=2013 |arxiv=1301.3522}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Due to falling power from its [[Radioisotope thermoelectric generator|RTG]], [[Ulysses (spacecraft)|Ulysses]] was decommissioned on June 30, 2009.

|headquarters = [[Basel, Switzerland]]
|website      = {{url|https://www.musicology.org/}}
|type=Nonprofit organization|logo=}}

==Overview==
The International Musicological Society was founded on September 30, 1927 on the initiative of [[Henry Prunières]], during the celebration of the centenary of the death of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. His proposal aimed to resurrect the International Music Society, which had dissolved in 1914, and was met with great interest.

The IMS organizes an international congress every five years, in years ending in 2 or 7. At these congresses, members elect the directorium. The most recent congress took place in [http://ims2017-tokyo.org/ Tokyo in 2017]. The next congress will be in Athens in 2022. In between these congresses, they also sponsor international symposia on specialized subjects.

The IMS collaborates closely with the [[International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres]] to produce several directories:
* [[Répertoire international d'iconographie musicale|Répertoire International d'Iconographie Musicale]] (RIdIM)
* [[Répertoire international de littérature musicale|Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale]] (RILM)
* [[Répertoire international de la presse musicale|Répertoire International de la Presse Musicale]] (RIPM)
* [[Répertoire international des sources musicales|Répertoire International des Sources Musicales]] (RISM)

== Publications ==
The IMS publishes a peer-reviewed journal twice a year, ''[[Acta Musicologica]]'', printed in several languages addressing musicological research of international importance. ''Acta'' has been published by [[Bärenreiter]] since 1954. The current editors are [[Philip V. Bohlman]] and [[Federico Celestini]].

== Membership ==
The IMS membership includes individuals, institutions, libraries, and organizations. Among its organizational members are: the [[American Musicological Society]] (AMS), the [[Royal Musical Association]], the Schweizerische Musikforschende Gesellschaft, the Paul Sacher Stiftung, the Deutsches Musikgeschichtliches Archiv, the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Musikforschung, the Staatliches Institut für Musikforschung Berlin, the [[Internationale Stiftung Mozarteum]], the Oesterreichische Akademie der Wissenschaften, the Società Italiana di Musicologia, and the Société française de musicologie, Société Belge de musicologie, the Danish Musicological Society, Vereniging van Nederlandse Muziekgeschiedenis, Societat Catalana de Musicologia, The Friends of Music Society, Greece, The Musicological Society of Japan, and the Musicological Society of Australia.

'''Lagos Deep Offshore Logistics Base''' (LADOL), officially '''LADOL Free Zone''', also known as '''LADOL Base''' or the initials '''LFZ''', is an industrial [[Special Economic Zone|Free Zone]] privately owned logistics and engineering facility located on an island  in the Port of [[Apapa]], [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]].

LADOL was designed to provide logistics, engineering and other support services to offshore oil &amp; gas exploration and production companies operating in and around West Africa.

== History ==
[[File:Ladol Activity at quay.jpg|thumb]]
LADOL's developer, LiLe, began the construction of the logistics and engineering base in 2001 and commenced full operations in 2006. In June 2006, LADOL was designated as a [[Free economic zone|Free Zone]] pursuant to the Nigeria Export Processing Zones Act No. 63 1992. Completed at a cost of US$150 million, LADOL's initial infrastructures included: a 200m quay, 8.5m draft, 25-ton/m2 high load bearing area and additional 30-ton bollards at either end that can accommodate up to six [[platform supply vessel|supply vessels]] and three [[heavy-lift ship|heavy-lift vessels]]; a hotel; warehouse; office complex; road; water treatment; and underground reticulation.

In 2015, with the support of [[Total S.A.|Total]] Upstream Nigeria Limited, LADOL was further expanded to include a new US$300 million [[Floating Production Storage and Offloading]] (FPSO) vessel fabrication and integration facility. The FPSO vessel fabrication and integration facility - currently being operated by SHI-MCI FZE, a Nigerian Local Content initiative-driven incorporated [[joint venture]] between [[Samsung Heavy Industries]] and LADOL's [[shipyard]] operator, Mega-Construction and Integration FZE - was initiated to fabricate and integrate Total Egina FPSO in Nigeria and other similar projects expected to be carried out in Africa.

The next phase of LADOL's expansion has been reported to include a [[dry dock]] that will be the largest in West Africa and attract as many as 100,000 direct and indirect jobs.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.thebusinessyear.com/nigeria-2015/future-today/interview| TBY talks to Dr. Amy Jadesimi, Managing Director of Lagos Deep Offshore Logistics Base (LADOL), on the company's business model, the joint venture with Samsung, and plans for the near future reported by The Business Year| 2 Mar 2016]'' Retrieved 29 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In December 2015, LADOL won the award for ''‘Outstanding Free Zone Integrated Hub Capacity Building Firm for Deep Water Oil &amp; Gas Exploration, Manufacturing and Engineering Services’'' by The [[Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ladol.com/ladol-wins-award/ LADOL wins award from The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport]'' Retrieved 29 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2015, LADOL won 5 awards in [[fDi Magazine]] Global Free Zones of the Year Annual Rankings 2015.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.fdiintelligence.com/Locations/fDi-Global-Free-Zones-of-the-Year-2015-Winners fDi Global Free Zones of the Year 2015 – Winners]'' Retrieved 29 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It was awarded ''winner of the Sub-Saharan African regional free zones award'' and ''winner of the Large Tenants award'' for Africa. LADOL was also ''Highly Commended as African Free Zone of the year''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ladol.com/ladol-wins-5-awards-in-fdi-global-free-zones-of-the-year-annual-rankings-2015/ LADOL wins 5 awards in fDi Global Free Zones of the Year Annual Rankings 2015]'' Retrieved 29 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Who==

There are two major naval forces that conduct such operations; the United States Coast Guard and the United States Navy. Although they both have very distinct jobs from one another, one of their major jobs is to be able to provide security operations.

The U.S Coast Guard is a branch of the [[United States Armed Forces]], they have eleven official missions. Their role is to provide port &amp; waterway security, drug interdiction, search and rescue, marine environment protection, [[ICE operations]], aids to navigation, living marine recourses, marine safety, defense readiness, law enforcement and migrant interdiction along with several other missions. Overall, their role is to provide a safer maritime industry.

Along with the U.S Coast Guard, the U.S Navy is also another branch if the Unites Stated Armed forces. Unlike the Coast Guard, the Navy is a projection of force in areas beyond the U.S shores. Their operations go beyond the shores; they provide aid to military out on the sea, carry troops to other countries, strategic plans for attacks and protect the sea lanes.

==Operations==
Today's modern naval force have been able to detect, strategize, and prevent dozens of several illegal activities. Piracy, being one of the must known crime in the maritime industry has not been able to control its activities. Piracy was known to have a great presence during the early 1500s, up to this day the number of piracy activity is still significantly large. From the beginning of the twentieth century, the number of piracy attack have been found to be cyclical in nature, taking its high points in 2003 and 2010. In spite of this high point, several organization against anti-piracy such as the [[Northern Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO)&lt;ref&gt;Counter-piracy operations (Archived). (2016, December 19). Retrieved April 9, 2017, from http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_48815.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  have been able to disrupt pirates attacks protecting vessel and their crew member along with their cargo.  As a safety measure, the U.S Coast Guard encourage the ships' captain to know his crew, deliver a detailed plan of his sea trip to a trusted friend, final check before departing, notify Coast Guard of any suspicious activity, and finally consider clearing local customs before departing on a foreign cruise. Taking these protective measures will lessen the possibility of piracy or high jacking.&lt;ref&gt;Nincic, D. J. (2013, October 1). Maritime Security: Current Threats and Implications.

A significant amount of contraband such as drugs has entered many ports through vessels claiming to be caring different types of cargo. Drug Interdiction is one of the eleven Coast Guard official missions, they aim to prevent drug traffic by intersecting drug carrying vessels out at sea. Mariners aboard a vessel that have information that a ship is involved in narcotics trafficking are required to contact their nearest Coast Guard unit. Several cargo ships have been contained with thousands of kilos on board. In the mid-year of 2015, the {{USS|Gary|FFG 51}} marked its tenth successful interdiction since October 2014. Joining forces with the U.S Coast Guard and the Canadian Navy they contained 11,700 kilograms of cocaine off the coast of Central America. While conducting a regular patrol the USS Gary tailed and located a small coastal freighter. After observing the crew discarding suspicious contraband overboard Gary launched a small boat to recover the suspected contraband.&lt;ref&gt;Singer	USS ''GARY'' (FFG 51) Public Affairs Officer, %. %.

Slavery also known as human trafficking in modern days is the act of forcing some type of labor or sexual act upon someone. As the years go by the number of men, women, and children being trafficking are significantly large, this is happening around the world including the United States. Human trafficking comes second to drug trafficking generating billions of dollars per year. This crime is hard to follow up due to the victim's language and fear to the traffickers and law enforcement. The [[Department of the Navy]] (DoN) and the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] (DoD) along with other offices have come together to fight and ensure that the Combating Trafficking in the Persons (CTIP) policies are properly implemented and integrated. In the month of January 2017, the SDPD was able to arrest 38 men involved with human trafficking during an undercover operation. Even though the Coast Guard and the Navy were not involved in this operation, they also have operations similar to drug trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;Human Trafficking. (2017, March 22).

Search and rescue missions is also considered a maritime security operation, it is one of the oldest Coast Guard missions. As the leader in the field of search and rescue missions, worldwide, to do so the coast guard keeps facilities on the East, West, and Gulf coasts. When a [[search and rescue]](SAR) mission is being conducted, it involves cutter, aircraft, and boats. Their goal is to minimize the loss of life and injuries, to provide aid to those in need of it. Using the coordinates of the vessel in need gives the Coast Guard and an idea of where to look for. These coordinates are given by a device called a "Black Box".&lt;ref&gt;U. S.

An example of such operations is the involvement of the multinational coalition [[Combined Task Force 150]], which performs Maritime Security Operations in the [[Indian Ocean]] and [[Persian Gulf]]. During the [[Somali Civil War]], they provided anti-piracy operations along the coast of [[Somalia]] in international waters. During the [[War in Somalia (2006–2009)|2006–2007 war]], they performed a cordon along the coast to prevent the escape of [[Al-Qaeda]] operatives by sea.&lt;!-- ==See also== --&gt;

[[File:Mystery Play Metz.jpg|thumb|Depiction of a performance of the Mystery Play of [[Clement of Metz|Saint Clement]] in [[Metz]] during the Middle Ages.]]

'''Mystery plays''' and '''miracle plays''' (they are distinguished as two different forms although the terms are often used interchangeably&lt;ref&gt;'Properly speaking, Mysteries deal with Gospel events only). Miracle Plays, on the other hand, are concerned with incidents derived from the legends of the saints of the Church.' {{cite book|last=Ward|first=Augustus William|title=History of English dramatic literature|publisher=Macmillan|location=London, England|year=1875 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) are among the earliest formally developed [[Play (theatre)|plays]] in [[medieval Europe]]. Medieval mystery plays focused on the representation of [[Bible]] stories in [[Church (building)|churches]] as [[tableau vivant|tableaux]] with accompanying [[antiphon]]al song. They told of subjects such as the Creation, Adam and Eve, the murder of Abel, and the [[Last Judgment]].&lt;ref&gt;"Vernacular Drama | Medieval Drama." Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 27 May 2013. Web. 7 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Often they were performed together in cycles which could last for days.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatrefolk.com/spotlights/72/download |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208054447/https://www.theatrefolk.com/spotlights/72/download |archive-date=8 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name derives from ''[[Sacred Mysteries|mystery]]'' used in its sense of ''[[miracle]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|date=December 2009|chapter=mystery, n&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; but an occasionally quoted derivation is from ''ministerium'', meaning ''[[craft]]'', and so the 'mysteries' or plays performed by the [[craft guilds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gassner|first=John|author2=Quinn, Edward|title=The Reader's Encyclopedia of World Drama|publisher=Methuen|location=London|year=1969|pages=203–204|chapter=England: middle ages|oclc=249158675}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Mystery play 001.jpg|thumb|Mystery play, [[Flanders]], 15th century]]
As early as the fifth century living tableaux were introduced into sacred services.&lt;ref name=bellinger&gt;[http://www.theatrehistory.com/medieval/bellinger001.html Bellinger, Martha Fletcher, "A Thousand Years Of Quiescence And The Beginnings Of Sacred Drama", ''A Short History of the Drama'', New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1927. pp. 115-21]&lt;/ref&gt;
The plays originated as simple ''[[Trope (religion)|tropes]]'', verbal embellishments of liturgical texts, and slowly became more elaborate. At an early period chants from the service of the day were added to the prose dialogue. As these liturgical dramas increased in popularity, vernacular forms emerged, as travelling companies of actors and theatrical productions organized by local communities became more common in the later Middle Ages.

The ''[[Quem quaeritis?]]'' is the best known early form of the dramas, a dramatised liturgical dialogue between the angel at the tomb of Christ and the women who are seeking his body.&lt;ref name=bellinger/&gt; These primitive forms were later elaborated with dialogue and dramatic action. Eventually the dramas moved from church to the exterior - the churchyard and the public marketplace. These early performances were given in Latin, and were preceded by a vernacular prologue spoken by a herald who gave a synopsis of the events. The writers and directors of the earliest plays were probably monks. Religious drama flourished from about the ninth century to the sixteenth.

In 1210, suspicious of the growing popularity of miracle plays, [[Pope Innocent III]] issued a [[Papal bull|papal edict]] forbidding clergy from acting on a public stage. This had the effect of transferring the organization of the dramas to town guilds, after which several changes followed. Vernacular texts replaced Latin, and non-Biblical passages were added along with comic scenes, for example in the ''[[The Second Shepherds' Play|Secunda Pastorum]]'' of the [[Wakefield Cycle]]. Acting and characterization became more elaborate.

These vernacular religious performances were, in some of the larger cities in England such as [[York]], performed and produced by [[guild]]s, with each guild taking responsibility for a particular piece of scriptural history. From the guild control originated the term mystery play or mysteries, from the Latin ''ministerium''&lt;!-- with 'i', misterium means mystery --&gt; meaning "occupation" (i.e. that of the guilds). The genre was again banned, following the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] and the establishment of the [[Church of England]] in 1534.

The mystery play developed, in some places, into a series of plays dealing with all the major events in the Christian calendar, from the Creation to the Day of Judgment. By the end of the 15th century, the practice of acting these plays in cycles on festival days was established in several parts of Europe. Sometimes, each play was performed on a decorated pageant cart that moved about the city to allow different crowds to watch each play as well as provided actors with a dressing room as well as a stage&lt;ref&gt;"Mystery Play | Dramatic Genre." Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica, 27 May 2013. Web. 6 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire cycle could take up to twenty hours to perform and could be spread over a number of days. Taken as a whole, these are referred to as ''Corpus Christi cycles''. These cycles were often performed during the [[Feast of Corpus Christi]] and their overall design drew attention to Christ's life and his redemption for all of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Windeatt, Barry. "Medieval Imaginations: Literature &amp; Visual Culture in the Middle Ages." Medieval Imaginations: Literature &amp; Visual Culture in the Middle Ages. University of Cambridge, n.d. Web. 7 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plays were performed by a combination of professionals and amateurs and were written in highly elaborate stanza forms; they were often marked by the extravagance of the sets and 'special effects', but could also be stark and intimate. The variety of theatrical and poetic styles, even in a single cycle of plays, could be remarkable.

==English mystery plays==
[[File:04b266 adamandeve.jpg|thumb|Actors portraying [[Adam and Eve]] are expelled from paradise in a performance by the Players of St Peter]]
There are four complete or nearly complete extant English biblical collections of plays;&lt;ref&gt;Windeatt, Barry. "Medieval Imaginations: Literature &amp; Visual Culture in the Middle Ages." Medieval Imaginations: Literature &amp; Visual Culture in the Middle Ages. University of Cambridge, n.d. Web. 7 February 2015. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110111182223/http://www.english.cam.ac.uk/medieval/mystery_plays.php ]&lt;/ref&gt; although these collections are sometimes referred to as "cycles," it is now believed that this term may attribute to these collections more coherence than they in fact possess. The most complete is the ''[[York Mystery Plays|York cycle]]'' of forty-eight pageants; there are also the ''[[Wakefield Cycle|Towneley plays]]'' of thirty-two pageants, once thought to have been a true 'cycle' of plays acted at [[Wakefield]]; the [[N-Town Plays|Ludus Coventriae]], now generally agreed to be a redacted compilation of at least three older, unrelated plays, and the ''[[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester cycle]]'' of twenty-four pageants, now generally agreed to be an Elizabethan reconstruction of older medieval traditions. Also extant are two pageants from a New Testament [[Coventry Mystery Plays|cycle acted at Coventry]] and one pageant each from Norwich and Newcastle upon Tyne. Additionally, a fifteenth-century play of the life of [[Mary Magdalene]], ''[[The Brome Abraham and Isaac]]'' and a sixteenth-century play of the ''Conversion of [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]]'' exist, all hailing from [[East Anglia]]. Besides the [[Middle English]] drama, there are three surviving plays in [[Cornish language|Cornish]] known as the [[Ordinalia]], and several cyclical plays survive from continental Europe.

These biblical plays differ widely in content. Most contain episodes such as the ''Fall of Lucifer'', the ''Creation and Fall of Man'', ''Cain and Abel'', ''Noah and the Flood'', ''Abraham and Isaac'', the ''Nativity'', the ''Raising of Lazarus'', the ''Passion'', and the ''Resurrection''. Other pageants included the story of ''Moses'', the ''Procession of the Prophets'', ''Christ's Baptism'', the ''Temptation in the Wilderness'', and the ''Assumption and Coronation of the Virgin''. In given cycles, the plays came to be sponsored by the newly emerging Medieval [[craft guild]]s. The York [[mercery|mercers]], for example, sponsored the ''Doomsday'' pageant. Other guilds presented scenes appropriate to their trade: the building of the [[Noah's Ark|Ark]] from the carpenters' guild; the [[Feeding the multitude|five loaves and fishes]] miracle from the bakers; and the [[visit of the Magi]], with their offerings of gold, frankincense and myrrh, from the goldsmiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oxenford|first=Lyn|title=Playing Period Plays |year=1958|publisher=Coach House Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=0853435499|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mikics|first=David |title=A New Handbook of Literary Terms |year=2007|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=9780300106367|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The guild associations are not, however, to be understood as the method of production for all towns. While the Chester pageants are associated with guilds, there is no indication that the N-Town plays are either associated with guilds or performed on [[pageant wagon]]s. Perhaps the most famous of the mystery plays, at least to modern readers and audiences, are those of Wakefield. Unfortunately, we cannot know whether the plays of the Towneley manuscript are actually the plays performed at Wakefield but a reference in the ''Second Shepherds' Play'' to [[Horbury|Horbery]] Shrogys &lt;ref&gt;http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-old?id=AnoTown&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/lv1/Archive/mideng-parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=13&amp;division=div (line 454) {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020830231810/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-old?data=%2Flv1%2FArchive%2Fmideng-parsed&amp;division=div&amp;id=AnoTown&amp;images=images%2Fmodeng&amp;part=13&amp;tag=public |date=30 August 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is strongly suggestive. In "The London Burial Grounds" by Mrs Basil Holmes (1897), the author claims that the Holy Priory Church, next to [[St Katherine Cree]] on Leadenhall Street, London was the location of miracle plays from the tenth to the sixteenth century. [[Edmund Bonner]], Bishop of London (c 1500 - 1569) stopped this in 1542.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londoncemeteries.co.uk/?page=holmes |title=The London Burial Grounds: Notes on their History from the Earliest Times to the Present Day -Mrs. Basil Holmes (St Katherine Cree) |publisher=Londoncemeteries.co.uk |accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous plays of the Towneley collection are attributed to the Wakefield Master, an anonymous playwright who wrote in the fifteenth century. The epithet "Wakefield Master" was first applied to this individual by the literary historian Gayley. The Wakefield Master gets his name from the geographic location where he lived, the market-town of Wakefield in Yorkshire. He may have been a highly educated cleric there, or possibly a friar from a nearby monastery at Woodkirk, four miles north of Wakefield. It was once thought that this anonymous author wrote a series of 32 plays (each averaging about 384 lines) called the Towneley Cycle. The Master's contributions to this collection are still much debated, and some scholars believe he may have written fewer than ten of them. These works appear in a single manuscript, currently found in the Huntington Library of California. It shows signs of Protestant editing &amp;mdash; references to the Pope and the sacraments are crossed out, for instance. Likewise, twelve manuscript leaves were ripped out between the two final plays because of Catholic references. This evidence strongly suggests the play was still being read and performed as late as 1520, perhaps as late in Renaissance as the final years of King Henry VIII's reign.

The best known pageant in the Towneley manuscript is ''The Second Shepherds' Pageant'', a burlesque of the Nativity featuring Mak the sheep stealer and his wife Gill, which more or less explicitly compares a stolen lamb to the Saviour of mankind. The ''[[Harrowing of Hell]]'', derived from the apocryphal ''[[Acts of Pilate]]'', was a popular part of the York and Wakefield cycles.

The dramas of the [[Elizabethan theatre|Elizabethan]] and [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] periods were developed out of mystery plays.

==Spanish mystery plays==

The [[Misteri d'Elx]] (in English, the [[Elx Mystery Play]] or [[Mystery Play of Elx]]) is a liturgical drama dating from the Middle Ages which has been enacted and celebrated every year without any known interruptions. Commemorating the Assumption of Mary, it is played on every 14 and 15 August in the Basilica de Santa María in the city of [[Elx]] (also known as [[Elche]]). The prohibition of theatrical plays in churches by the [[Council of Trent]] eventually threatened to interrupt the yearly performance of the Misteri, but in 1632 [[Pope Urban VIII]] issued a special permit for its continuation. In 2001, UNESCO declared it one of the Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

The oldest liturgical drama (12th century) written already in old Spanish language was a [[codex]] found in the library of the [[Toledo Cathedral]]. The Auto de los Reyes Magos belongs to the Christmas cycle. It is a play about the [[Biblical Magi]], three wise men from the East who followed a star and visited the baby Jesus in [[Bethlehem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/liturgical-drama |title=Liturgical drama: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to have been based on an earlier liturgical Latin play written in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Spanish Language and Literature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Miracle play==
Miracle plays, or ''Saint's plays,'' are now distinguished from mystery plays as they specifically re-enacted miraculous interventions by the [[saint]]s, particularly [[St. Nicholas]] or [[St. Mary]], into the lives of ordinary people, rather than biblical events;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|chapter=mystery play}}&lt;/ref&gt; however both of these terms are more commonly used by modern scholars than they were by medieval people, who used a wide variety of terminology to refer to their dramatic performances.

==Modern performances==
Mystery Plays are still produced regularly throughout the [[United Kingdom]]. The local cycles were revived in both [[York]] and [[Chester]] in 1951 as part of the [[Festival of Britain]], and are still performed by the local guilds.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, Margaret. [http://www.yorkmysteryplays.co.uk/the-plays-and-the-guilds/ The Plays and the Guilds] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101125612/http://www.yorkmysteryplays.co.uk/the-plays-and-the-guilds/ |date=1 November 2015 }}, ''York Mystery Plays''&lt;/ref&gt; The N-Town cycle was revived in 1978 as the [[Lincoln mystery plays]],

An adaptation of Harrison's play was staged at [[Shakespeare's Globe]] in 2011 as ''The Globe Mysteries''.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare's Globe.

In 2001, the [[Isango Ensemble]] produced an African version of the Chester Cycle at the [[Garrick Theatre]] in London as ''The Mysteries – Yiimimangaliso'', performing in a combination of the [[Xhosa language]], the [[Zulu language]], English, [[Latin]] and [[Afrikaans]]. They revived an adapted version of the production at Shakespeare's Globe in 2015 as ''The Mysteries''.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare's Globe.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15941">'''Neurorobotics''', a combined study of [[neuroscience]], [[robotics]], and [[artificial intelligence]], is the science and technology of embodied autonomous neural systems. Neural systems include brain-inspired algorithms (e.g. connectionist networks), computational models of biological neural networks (e.g. artificial [[spiking neural network]]s, large-scale simulations of neural microcircuits) and actual biological systems (e.g. ''in vivo'' and ''in vitro'' neural nets). Such neural systems can be embodied in machines with mechanic or any other forms of physical actuation. This includes [[robot]]s, [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] or wearable systems but also, at smaller scale, micro-machines and, at the larger scales, furniture and infrastructures.

Neurorobotics is that branch of neuroscience with robotics, which deals with the study and application of science and technology of embodied autonomous neural systems like brain-inspired algorithms. At its core, neurorobotics is based on the idea that the brain is embodied and the body is embedded in the environment. Therefore, most neurorobots are required to function in the real world, as opposed to a simulated environment.&lt;ref&gt;Chiel, H. J., &amp; Beer, R. D. (1997). The brain has a body: adaptive behavior emerges from interactions of nervous system, body and environment. [Editorial Material]. Trends in Neurosciences, 20(12), 553-557.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond brain-inspired algorithms for robots neurorobotics may also involve the design of brain-controlled robot systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vannucci|first1=L.|last2=Ambrosano|first2=A.|last3=Cauli|first3=N.|last4=Albanese|first4=U.|last5=Falotico|first5=E.|last6=Ulbrich|first6=S.|last7=Pfotzer|first7=L.|last8=Hinkel|first8=G.|last9=Denninger|first9=O.|last10=Peppicelli|first10=D.|last11=Guyot|first11=L.|last12=Arnim|first12=A.

== Introduction ==
Neurorobotics represents the two-front approach to the study of intelligence.  Neuroscience attempts to discern what intelligence consists of and how it works by investigating intelligent biological systems, while the study of artificial intelligence attempts to recreate intelligence through non-biological, or artificial means. Neurorobotics is the overlap of the two, where biologically inspired theories are tested in a grounded environment, with a physical implementation of said model. The successes and failures of a neurorobot and the model it is built from can provide evidence to refute or support that theory, and give insight for future study.

== Major classes of neurorobotic models ==
Neurorobots can be divided into various major classes based on the robot's purpose. Each class is designed to implement a specific mechanism of interest for study. Common types of neurorobots are those used to study motor control, memory, action selection, and perception.

=== Locomotion and motor control ===
Neurorobots are often used to study motor [[feedback]] and control systems, and have proved their merit in developing controllers for robots. [[Animal locomotion|Locomotion]] is modeled by a number of neurologically inspired theories on the action of motor systems. Locomotion control has been mimicked using models or [[central pattern generator]]s, clumps of neurons capable of driving repetitive behavior, to make four-legged walking robots.&lt;ref&gt;Ijspeert, A. J., Crespi, A., Ryczko, D., and Cabelguen, J. M. (2007). From swimming to walking with a salamander robot driven by a spinal cord model. Science 315, 1416-1420.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other groups have expanded the idea of combining rudimentary control systems into a hierarchical set of simple autonomous systems. These systems can formulate complex movements from a combination of these rudimentary subsets.&lt;ref&gt;Giszter, S. F., Moxon, K. A., Rybak, I. A., &amp; Chapin, J. K. (2001). Neurobiological and neurorobotic approaches to control architectures for a humanoid motor system. Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 37(2-3), 219-235.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory of motor action is based on the organization of [[cortical column]]s, which progressively integrate from simple sensory input into a complex [[afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] signals, or from complex motor programs to simple controls for each [[skeletal muscle#Muscle fibers|muscle fiber]] in [[efferent nerve fiber|efferent]] signals, forming a similar hierarchical structure.

Another method for motor control uses learned error correction and predictive controls to form a sort of simulated [[muscle memory]]. In this model, awkward, random, and error-prone movements are corrected for using error feedback to produce smooth and accurate movements over time. The controller learns to create the correct control signal by predicting the error.  Using these ideas, robots have been designed which can learn to produce adaptive arm movements&lt;ref&gt;Eskiizmirliler, S., Forestier, N., Tondu, B., and Darlot, C. (2002). A model of the cerebellar pathways applied to the control of a single-joint robot arm actuated by McKibben artificial muscles. Biol Cybern 86, 379-394.&lt;/ref&gt; or to avoid obstacles in a course.

=== Learning and memory systems ===
Robots designed to test theories of animal [[memory]] systems. Many studies currently examine the memory system of rats, particularly the rat [[hippocampus]], dealing with [[place cells]], which fire for a specific location that has been learned.&lt;ref&gt;O'Keefe, J., and Nadel, L. (1978). The hippocampus as a cognitive map (Oxford: Clarendon Press).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=behavior-based&gt;Mataric, M. J. (1998). Behavior-based robotics as a tool for synthesis of artificial behavior and analysis of natural behavior. [Review]. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 2(3), 82-87.&lt;/ref&gt; Systems modeled after the rat hippocampus are generally able to learn [[cognitive map|mental maps]] of the environment, including recognizing landmarks and associating behaviors with them, allowing them to predict the upcoming obstacles and landmarks.&lt;ref name=behavior-based /&gt;

Another study has produced a robot based on the proposed learning paradigm of barn owls for orientation and localization based on primarily auditory, but also visual stimuli. The hypothesized method involves synaptic plasticity and [[Neuromodulation (biology)|neuromodulation]],&lt;ref name=barn-owls&gt;Rucci, M., Bullock, D., &amp; Santini, F. (2007). Integrating robotics and neuroscience: brains for robots, bodies for brains. [Article]. Advanced Robotics, 21(10), 1115-1129.&lt;/ref&gt; a mostly chemical effect in which reward [[neurotransmitters]] such as dopamine or serotonin affect the firing sensitivity of a neuron to be sharper.&lt;ref name=neuromodulation&gt;Cox, B. R., &amp; Krichmar, J. L. (2009). Neuromodulation as a Robot Controller A Brain-Inspired Strategy for Controlling Autonomous Robots. [Article]. IEEE Robotics &amp; Automation Magazine, 16(3), 72-80. {{doi|10.1109/mra.2009.933628}}&lt;/ref&gt; The robot used in the study adequately matched the behavior of barn owls.&lt;ref name=robotowl&gt;Rucci, M., Edelman, G. M. and Wray, J. (1999). Adaptation of orienting behavior: from the barn owl to a robotic system [Article]. IEEE Transactions on Robotics and Automation, 15(1), 96-110.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the close interaction between motor output and auditory feedback proved to be vital in the learning process, supporting active sensing theories that are involved in many of the learning models.&lt;ref name=barn-owls /&gt;

Neurorobots in these studies are presented with simple mazes or patterns to learn. Some of the problems presented to the neurorobot include recognition of symbols, colors, or other patterns and execute simple actions based on the pattern. In the case of the barn owl simulation, the robot had to determine its location and direction to navigate in its environment.

=== Action selection and value systems ===
Action selection studies deal with negative or positive weighting to an action and its outcome.  Neurorobots can and have been used to study *simple* ethical interactions, such as the classical thought experiment where there are more people than a life raft can hold, and someone must leave the boat to save the rest. However, more neurorobots used in the study of action selection contend with much simpler persuasions such as self-preservation or perpetuation of the population of robots in the study. These neurorobots are modeled after the neuromodulation of synapses to encourage circuits with positive results.&lt;ref name=neuromodulation /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hasselmo, M. E., Hay, J., Ilyn, M., and Gorchetchnikov, A. (2002). Neuromodulation, theta rhythm and rat spatial navigation. Neural Netw 15, 689-707.&lt;/ref&gt; In biological systems, neurotransmitters such as dopamine or acetylcholine positively reinforce neural signals that are beneficial. One study of such interaction involved the robot Darwin VII, which used visual, auditory, and a simulated taste input to "eat" conductive metal blocks. The arbitrarily chosen good blocks had a striped pattern on them while the bad blocks had a circular shape on them. The taste sense was simulated by conductivity of the blocks.  The robot had positive and negative feedbacks to the taste based on its level of conductivity. The researchers observed the robot to see how it learned its action selection behaviors based on the inputs it had.&lt;ref&gt;Krichmar, J. L., and Edelman, G. M. (2002). Machine Psychology: Autonomous Behavior, Perceptual Categorization, and Conditioning in a Brain-Based Device. Cerebral Cortex 12, 818-830.&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have used herds of small robots which feed on batteries strewn about the room, and communicate its findings to other robots.&lt;ref&gt;Doya, K., and Uchibe, E. (2005). The Cyber Rodent Project: Exploration of Adaptive Mechanisms for Self-Preservation and Self-Reproduction. Adaptive Behavior 13, 149 - 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sensory perception ===
Neurorobots have also been used to study sensory perception, particularly vision.  These are primarily systems that result from embedding neural models of sensory pathways in automatas. This approach gives exposure to the sensory signals that occur during behavior and also enables a more realistic assessment of the degree of robustness of the neural model. It is well known that changes in the sensory
signals produced by motor activity provide useful [[active perception|perceptual cues]] that are used extensively by organisms. For example, researchers have used the depth information that emerges during replication of human head and eye movements to establish robust representations of the visual scene.&lt;ref&gt;
Santini, F, and Rucci, M. (2007). Active estimation of distance in a robotic system that replicates human eye movements Journal of Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 55, 107-121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuang, K., Gibson, M., Shi, B. E., Rucci, M. (2012). Active vision during coordinated head/eye movements in a humanoid robot, IEEE Transactions on Robotics, 99, 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biological robots ==
[[Biological robot]]s are not officially neurorobots in that they are not neurologically inspired AI systems, but actual neuron tissue wired to a robot. This employs the use of [[cultured neural networks]] to study brain development or neural interactions. These typically consist of a neural culture raised on a [[multielectrode array]] (MEA), which is capable of both recording the neural activity and stimulating the tissue. In some cases, the MEA is connected to a computer which presents a simulated environment to the brain tissue and translates brain activity into actions in the simulation, as well as providing sensory feedback.&lt;ref&gt;DeMarse, T. B., Wagenaar, D. A., Blau, A. W. and Potter, S. M. (2001). "The Neurally Controlled Animat: Biological Brains Acting with Simulated Bodies." Autonomous Robots 11: 305-310.&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to record neural activity gives researchers a window into a brain, albeit simple, which they can use to learn about a number of the same issues neurorobots are used for.

An area of concern with the biological robots is ethics. Many questions are raised about how to treat such experiments. Seemingly the most important question is that of consciousness and whether or not the rat brain experiences it. This discussion boils down to the many theories of what consciousness is.&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, K. (2010). Implications and consequences of robots with biological brains. [Article]. Ethics and Information Technology, 12(3), 223-234. {{doi|10.1007/s10676-010-9218-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ebooks.iospress.nl/publication/38568|title=IOS Press Ebooks - Brains on Wheels: Theoretical and Ethical Issues in Bio-Robotics|website=ebooks.iospress.nl|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''See [[Hybrot]], [[consciousness]].''

== Implications for neuroscience ==
Neuroscientists benefit from neurorobotics because it provides a blank slate to test various possible methods of brain function in a controlled and testable environment. Furthermore, while the robots are more simplified versions of the systems they emulate, they are more specific, allowing more direct testing of the issue at hand.&lt;ref name=barn-owls /&gt; They also have the benefit of being accessible at all times, while it is much more difficult to monitor even large portions of a brain while the animal is active, let alone individual neurons.

With subject of neuroscience growing as it has, numerous neural treatments have emerged, from pharmaceuticals to neural rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;Bach-y-Rita, P. (1999). Theoretical aspects of sensory substitution and of neurotransmission-related reorganization in spinal cord injury. [Review]. Spinal Cord, 37(7), 465-474.&lt;/ref&gt; Progress is dependent on an intricate understanding of the brain and how exactly it functions. It is very difficult to study the brain, especially in humans due to the danger associated with cranial surgeries. Therefore, the use of technology to fill the void of testable subjects is vital. Neurorobots accomplish exactly this, improving the range of tests and experiments that can be performed in the study of neural processes.

The '''philosophy of environment''' is a trend of [[Freethought|free thought]] located between [[philosophy]], [[epistemology]] and [[anthropology]]. It combines various schools of philosophy such as humanist ecology, philosophy of evolution and environmental [[humanism]]. It is also meant to be a cultural trend having an influence in society.

The philosophical current indicated under the name philosophy of evolution has been developed since the 1970s by Humanist Ecology (also called Environmental or Evolutive Humanism) and by the [[Neo-Darwinism|neo-darwinian]] school. Its purpose is the long-term evolution of the complex [[Organism|living being]] in its universal environment, analysed through its Human cultural expression.

This trend is unique to the quasi religious Evolutionist Humanism advocated by [[Julian Huxley]], notably during the founders congress of the IHEU ([[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]) in 1952.

Further than the basic [[Theory|scientific theory]] of evolution (notably neo-[[darwinian]], Evolutive Humanism, developed by [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]]),  looks at the necessity for Man of a permanent adaptation of both his organism and his thoughts to his universal [[natural environment|environment]]. And from there to the relativized relation to belief and to uncertainty, because human ideas evolve and are transformed, as are physical qualities, in a universal process of [[evolution]] and adaptive improvement in their environment. But this does not suppose [[determinism]], genetic or cultural, it refers to the evolutive interactivity and reactivity, partly random, of the living being with his surroundings. According to [[Marc Carl]], "Man must necessarily learn to manage the insufficient appearance and the uncertainty of information to fit and to develop in his relational interactions with his environment, as well as physically and culturally". In a universal environment still as much as 90% unknown, this evolutive cogitation therefore tries not to be locked in premature schemata and answers. It encourages humility in proposals and intuitive boldness in investigations.
A subjacent humanist thought encourages human beings to deliberately take his destiny in his hands, in careful correlation with his environment, knowing that human thought is one of the most impacting manifestations of the living being, as an agent of transformation of the environment, and consequently not only of the Earth's environment. In terms of philosophy of evolution, the organized collective thought of humanity, and in general his evolutive culture, appears as the key to development of our [[species]] in its universal environment, and the key to a possibly significant interactive modification, in the long term, of this environment. It is principally a prospective step.

This cultural trend seems to have emerged because the concept of progressive permanent adaptation, which is no longer appreciated only by its scientific aspects, also took a metaphysical dimension (in a sense of research of the essence of the human), which consequently encourages analysis of [[human evolution]], an agent which potentially modifies our environment, in philosophical terms. The possibilities and the risks of this evolution, [[Nondeterministic algorithm|non-deterministic]] because of its integration into a dynamic complex living system, gives the human existence and destiny a new sense. And to be involved in such a cogitation opens a philosophical way in which curious minds could not miss advancing sooner or later, a way which rests on a regenerated [[metaphysics]], encouraging us to take back in an evolutive way Aristoteles original concept of physis and its substance, and to search with modern conceptual tools the essence and the sense of our life.

==Humanist ecology (environmental humanism)==

Supported by the philosophy of evolution, this international emerging concept has expressed since the 1970s an evolutive humanism, extending the naturalist tradition of ancient Greek philosophers. Humanist ecology encourages us to better understand and situate the place and the destiny of humanity in its environment in permanent evolution. Human destiny is put in perspective in a universal context where many things remain to be learned.  Because it encourages every human in a responsibility in front of his conscience, humanist ecology  can be defined too as a will of ethical responsibility of civilized humanity, favouring its permanent improvement and its happiness, in useful interaction with its evolutive environment, in a beneficial way as much for a human being particularly as for mankind in general, and in common symbiosis with their local and global bioscape in evolution. That serves to optimize [[Society|human society]] in its own interactions and in its interactions with its bioscape, notably by preserving the planetary equilibrium of the Earth. This solidarity of all of mankind is necessary to preserve its environment and its best development in this environment inspired a particular political expression of humanist ecology, taken up notably by Statesmen such as [[Jacques Chirac]] (France) or Mohammed VI (Morocco) in the main meetings of the United Nations.

==Evolution and its relativisation==

Humanist ecology naturally favours the permanent adaptation and the best possible development of humanity, and of the human being, in an uncertain universal environment in permanent evolution, with a mind open enough to consider all the possibilities. In humanist ecological comprehension, it is vain to want to freeze an arbitrary cultural schemata and choose the apparent equilibrium and the supposed future of one moment of evolution. A permanent evolutive adaptation is necessary, as much biologically as mentally. That requires relativity and a caution in the analysis. According to this concept, for the [[Mind|human mind]], any representation belongs to the domain of belief, considering the uncertainty of the relation of man to the universe, and the natural imperfection of his senses to represent his environment and his interactions with this environment; the reality perceived by Man being only one representation of reality, particular in mankind. Humanist ecology admits this relativized relation with [[belief]] but refutes any final and locking form, knowing that no truth can be final for the human mind without upsetting its natural evolutive necessity. This [[School (discipline)|school of thought]] accepts belief in the present, for want of anything better, but dictates that you must take care to verify and update beliefs.

Some theoretical concepts about plasma cosmology originated with [[Hannes Alfvén]], who tentatively&lt;ref name="Alfvenpu1987"&gt;{{cite journal

Cosmologists and astrophysicists who have evaluated plasma cosmology have rejected it because it does not match the observations of astrophysical phenomena as well as current cosmological theory. Very few papers supporting plasma cosmology have appeared in the literature since the mid-1990s.

The term ''plasma universe'' is sometimes used as a synonym for plasma cosmology,&lt;ref name="Peratt1992"/&gt; as an alternative description of the plasma in the universe.&lt;ref name=Alfven1990 /&gt;

|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this Alfvén–Klein cosmology, sometimes called Klein–Alfvén cosmology, the universe is made up of equal amounts of matter and [[antimatter]] with the boundaries between the regions of matter and antimatter being delineated by cosmic [[electromagnetic fields]] formed by [[Double layer (plasma physics)|double layers]], thin regions comprising two parallel layers with opposite electrical charge. Interaction between these boundary regions would generate radiation, and this would form the plasma. Alfvén introduced the term ambiplasma for a plasma made up of matter and antimatter and the double layers are thus formed of ambiplasma. According to Alfvén, such an ambiplasma would be relatively long-lived as the component particles and antiparticles would be too hot and too low-density to annihilate each other rapidly. The double layers will act to repel clouds of opposite type, but combine clouds of the same type, creating ever-larger regions of matter and antimatter. The idea of ambiplasma was developed further into the forms of heavy ambiplasma (protons-antiprotons) and light ambiplasma (electrons-positrons).&lt;ref name="Alfven1966" /&gt;

Alfvén–Klein cosmology was proposed in part to explain the observed [[baryon asymmetry]] in the universe, starting from an [[initial condition]] of exact [[symmetry]] between matter and antimatter. According to Alfvén and Klein, ambiplasma would naturally form pockets of matter and pockets of antimatter that would expand outwards as annihilation between matter and antimatter occurred in the double layer at the boundaries. They concluded that we must just happen to live in one of the pockets that was mostly [[baryon]]s rather than [[antibaryon]]s, explaining the baryon asymmetry. The pockets, or bubbles, of matter or antimatter would expand because of annihilations at the boundaries, which Alfvén considered as a possible explanation for the observed [[metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]], which would be merely a local phase of a much larger history. Alfvén postulated that the universe has always existed &lt;ref name="Alfven1988"&gt;{{cite web

In 1993, theoretical cosmologist [[Jim Peebles]] criticized Alfvén–Klein cosmology, writing that "there is no way that the results can be consistent with the isotropy of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] and [[X-ray background]]s".&lt;ref name="Peebles1993"&gt;{{cite book

|date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book he also showed that Alfvén's models do not predict [[Hubble's law]], [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis|the abundance of light elements]], or the existence of the [[cosmic microwave background]]. A further difficulty with the ambiplasma model is that matter–antimatter [[annihilation]] results in the production of high energy [[photon]]s, which are not observed in the amounts predicted. While it is possible that the local "matter-dominated" cell is simply larger than the [[observable universe]], this proposition does not lend itself to observational tests.

== Plasma cosmology and the study of galaxies ==

Hannes Alfvén from the 1960s to 1980s argued that plasma played an important if not dominant role in the universe because [[electromagnetic force]]s are far more important than [[gravity]] when acting on interplanetary and interstellar [[charged particle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;H. Alfvén and C.-G. Falthammar, ''Cosmic electrodynamics''(2nd edition, Clarendon press, Oxford, 1963). "The basic reason why electromagnetic phenomena are so important in cosmical physics is that there exist celestial magnetic fields which affect the motion of charged particles in space ... The strength of the interplanetary magnetic field is of the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; gauss (10 [[nanotesla]]s), which gives the [ratio of the magnetic force to the force of gravity] ≈ 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;. This illustrates the enormous importance of interplanetary and interstellar magnetic fields, compared to gravitation, as long as the matter is ionized." (p.2-3)&lt;/ref&gt; He further hypothesized that they might promote the contraction of [[interstellar cloud]]s and may even constitute the main mechanism for contraction, initiating [[star formation]].&lt;ref name="Alfven1978" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alfvén | first1 = H. | last2 = Carlqvist | first2 = P. | year = 1978 | title = Interstellar clouds and the formation of stars | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1978Ap%26SS..55..487A&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=42ca922c9c30728 | journal = Astrophysics and Space Science | volume = 55 | issue = 2| pages = 487–509 | bibcode=1978Ap&amp;SS..55..487A|doi = 10.1007/BF00642272 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The current standard view is that magnetic fields can hinder collapse, that large-scale [[Birkeland current]]s have not been observed, and that the length scale for charge neutrality is predicted to be far smaller than the relevant cosmological scales.&lt;ref name="Siegel2006" &gt;{{cite document |author= Siegel, E.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Alfvén and [[Anthony Peratt]], a plasma physicist at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], outlined a program they called the "plasma universe".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Alfvén | first1 = H. | year = 1986 | title = Model of the Plasma Universe | url = http://www.plasmauniverse.info/downloads/ModelOfTPU_Alfv%C3%A9n.pdf | format = PDF | journal = IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science | volume = PS-14 | issue =  | page =  | doi = 10.1109/tps.1986.4316614 | bibcode = 1986ITPS...14..629A }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WI1&gt;A.

In various venues, Peratt profiled what he characterized as an alternative viewpoint to the mainstream models applied in astrophysics and cosmology.&lt;ref name=WI1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=WI2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ST&gt;[http://www.plasmauniverse.info/downloads/CosmologyPeratt.pdf A.L.

For example, Peratt proposed that the mainstream approach to galactic dynamics which relied on gravitational modeling of stars and gas in galaxies with the addition of dark matter was overlooking a possibly major contribution from plasma physics.

==Comparison to mainstream astrophysics==
Standard astronomical modeling and theories attempt to incorporate all known [[physics]] into descriptions and explanations of observed phenomena, with [[Gravitation|gravity]] playing a dominant role on the largest scales as well as in [[celestial mechanics]] and [[Stellar dynamics|dynamics]]. To that end, both [[Keplerian]] orbits and [[Einstein]]'s [[general theory of relativity]] are generally used as the underlying frameworks for modeling astrophysical systems and [[structure formation]], while [[high-energy astronomy]] and [[particle physics in cosmology]] additionally appeal to [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] processes including plasma physics and [[radiative transfer]] to explain relatively small scale energetic processes observed in the [[x-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s. In conventional cosmology, [[plasma physics]] is not considered to be the dominant force on most large-scale phenomena, although much of the matter in the universe is thought to be ionised or exist as [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. (See [[astrophysical plasma]] for more.)

Proponents of plasma cosmology claim electrodynamics is as important as gravity in explaining the structure of the universe, and speculate that it provides an alternative explanation for the [[Galaxy formation and evolution|evolution of galaxies]]&lt;ref name=Peratt1986 /&gt; and the initial collapse of interstellar clouds.&lt;ref name=Alfven1978 /&gt; In particular plasma cosmology is claimed to provide an alternative explanation for the flat [[galaxy rotation curve|rotation curves]] of spiral galaxies and to do away with the need for [[dark matter]] in galaxies and with the need for [[supermassive black holes]] in galaxy centres to power [[quasars]] and [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]].&lt;ref name="Peratt1983"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Peratt1986 /&gt; However, theoretical analysis shows that "many scenarios for the generation of seed magnetic fields, which rely on the survival and sustainability of currents at early times [of the universe are disfavored]",&lt;ref name=Siegel2006 /&gt; i.e. Birkeland currents of the magnitude needed (10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; amps over scales of megaparsecs) for galaxy formation do not exist.&lt;ref name="Colafrancesco2006" &gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Colafrancesco | first1 = S. | last2 = Giordano | first2 = F. | year = 2006 | title = The impact of magnetic field on the cluster M - T relation | journal = Astronomy and Astrophysics | volume = 454 | issue = 3| pages = L131–134 | bibcode=2006A&amp;A...454L.131C | doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20065404|arxiv = astro-ph/0701852 }} recount: "Numerical simulations have shown that the wide-scale magnetic fields in massive clusters produce variations of the cluster mass at the level of ~ 5 − 10% of their unmagnetized value ... Such variations are not expected to produce strong variations in the relative [mass-temperature] relation for massive clusters."&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, many of the issues that were mysterious in the 1980s and 1990s, including discrepancies relating to the [[cosmic microwave background]] and the nature of [[quasars]], have been solved with more evidence that, in detail, provides a distance and time scale for the universe.

Some of the places where plasma cosmology supporters are most at odds with standard explanations include the need for their models to have light element production without [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], which, in the context of Alfvén–Klein cosmology, has been shown to produce excessive [[x-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s beyond that observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | display-authors = 0 | last1 = et al | year = 1985 | title = Big Bang Photosynthesis and Pregalactic Nucleosynthesis of Light Elements | url = http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?1985ApJ...293L..53A | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 293 | issue = | pages = L53–L57 | bibcode=1985ApJ...293L..53A|doi = 10.1086/184490 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Epstein | display-authors = etal   | year = 1976 | title = The origin of deuterium | doi = 10.1038/263198a0 | journal = Nature | volume = 263 | pages = 198–202|bibcode = 1976Natur.263..198E }} point out that if proton fluxes with energies greater than 500 MeV were intense enough to produce the observed levels of deuterium, they would also produce about 1000 times more gamma rays than are observed.&lt;/ref&gt; Plasma cosmology proponents have made further proposals to explain light element abundances, but the attendant issues have not been fully addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Ref. 10 in "Galactic Model of Element Formation" (Lerner, ''IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science'' Vol. 17, No. 2, April 1989 [http://www.health-freedom.info/pdf/Galactic%20Model%20of%20Element%20Formation.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229074857/http://www.health-freedom.info/pdf/Galactic%20Model%20of%20Element%20Formation.pdf |date=2006-12-29 }}) is J.Audouze and J.Silk, "Pregalactic Synthesis of Deuterium" in ''Proc.

He cites neither Audouze nor Epstein in this context, and does not explain why his result contradicts theirs.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Eric Lerner published his alternative explanation for the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lerner | first1 = Eric | date = 1995 | title = Intergalactic Radio Absorption and the COBE Data | url = http://www.photonmatrix.com/pdf/Intergalactic%20Radio%20Absorption%20And%20The%20COBE%20Data.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Astrophysics and Space Science | volume = 227 | issue =  | pages = 61–81 | doi = 10.1007/bf00678067 | bibcode = 1995Ap&amp;SS.227...61L | access-date = 2012-05-30 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110715083205/http://www.photonmatrix.com/pdf/Intergalactic%20Radio%20Absorption%20And%20The%20COBE%20Data.pdf | archive-date = 2011-07-15 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that his model explained the fidelity of the CMB spectrum to that of a black body and the low level of anisotropies found, even while the level of isotropy at 1:10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; is not accounted for to that precision by any alternative models. Additionally, the sensitivity and resolution of the measurement of the CMB anisotropies was greatly advanced by [[WMAP]] and the [[Planck satellite]] and the statistics of the signal were so in line with the predictions of the Big Bang model, that the CMB has been heralded as a major confirmation of the Big Bang model to the detriment of alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spergel | first1 = D.

[[File:PCB Spectrum.jpg|thumb|Part of a 1984 [[Sinclair Research|Sinclair]] [[ZX Spectrum]] computer board, a PCB, showing the conductive traces, [[via (electronics)|vias]] (the through-hole paths to the other surface), and some electronic components mounted using through-hole mounting.]]

A '''printed circuit board''' ('''PCB''') mechanically supports and electrically connects [[electronic components]] or [[electrical]] components using [[Electrical conductor|conductive]] tracks, pads and other features [[industrial etching|etch]]ed from one or more sheet layers of copper [[laminated]] onto and/or between sheet layers of a [[insulator (electricity)|non-conductive]] [[substrate (electronics)|substrate]]. Components are generally [[Soldering|soldered]] onto the PCB to both electrically connect and mechanically fasten them to it.

Printed circuit boards are used in all but the simplest electronic products. They are also used in some electrical products, such as passive switch boxes.

Alternatives to PCBs include [[wire wrap]] and [[point-to-point construction]], both once popular but now rarely used. PCBs require additional design effort to lay out the circuit, but manufacturing and assembly can be automated. Specialized CAD software is available to do much of the work of layout. Mass-producing circuits with PCBs is cheaper and faster than with other wiring methods, as components are mounted and wired in one operation.  Large numbers of PCBs can be fabricated at the same time, and the layout only has to be done once.  PCBs can also be made manually in small quantities, with reduced benefits.

PCBs can be single-sided (one copper layer), double-sided (two copper layers on both sides of one substrate layer), or multi-layer (outer and inner layers of copper, alternating with layers of substrate).  Multi-layer PCBs allow for much higher component density, because circuit traces on the inner layers would otherwise take up surface space between components.  The rise in popularity of multilayer PCBs with more than two, and especially with more than four, copper planes was concurrent with the adoption of [[surface mount technology]].  However, multilayer PCBs make repair, analysis, and field modification of circuits much more difficult and usually impractical.

The world market for bare PCBs exceeded $60.2 billion in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iconnect007.com/index.php/article/92973/world-pcb-production-in-2014-estimated-at-602b/92976/?skin=pcb|title=iconnect007 :: Article|website=www.iconnect007.com|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the Global Single Sided Printed Circuit Board Market Analysis Report estimated that the PCB market would reach $79 billion by 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/07/30/1543947/0/en/Global-Printed-Circuit-Board-PCB-Market-to-Witness-a-CAGR-of-3-1-during-2018-2024.html|title=Global Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Market to Witness a CAGR of 3.1% during 2018-2024|last=Research|first=Energias Market|work=GlobeNewswire News Room|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theindustryherald.com/2018/08/21/global-single-sided-printed-circuit-board-market-growth-future-prospects-and-competitive-analysis-and-forecast-2018-2023/|title=Global Single Sided Printed Circuit Board Market - Growth, Future Prospects and Competitive Analysis and Forecast 2018 - 2023 - The Industry Herald|date=2018-08-21|work=The Industry Herald|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the development of printed circuit boards electrical and electronic circuits were [[point-to-point construction|wired point-to-point]] on a chassis. Typically, the chassis was a sheet metal frame or pan, sometimes with a wooden bottom. Components were attached to the chassis, usually by insulators when the connecting point on the chassis was metal, and then their leads were connected directly or with jumper wires by soldering, or sometimes using crimp connectors, wire connector lugs on screw terminals, or other methods. Circuits were large, bulky, heavy, and relatively fragile (even discounting the breakable glass envelopes of the vacuum tubes that were often included in the circuits), and production was labor-intensive, so the products were expensive.

Development of the methods used in modern printed circuit boards started early in the 20th century. In 1903, a German inventor, Albert Hanson, described flat foil conductors laminated to an insulating board, in multiple layers. [[Thomas Edison]] experimented with chemical methods of plating conductors onto linen paper in 1904. Arthur Berry in 1913 patented a print-and-etch method in the UK, and in the United States Max Schoop obtained a patent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|1256599}}&lt;/ref&gt; to flame-spray metal onto a board through a patterned mask. Charles Ducas in 1927 patented a method of electroplating circuit patterns.&lt;ref name="Harper03"&gt;Charles A. Harper, ''Electronic materials and processes handbook'', McGraw-Hill,2003 {{ISBN|0-07-140214-4}}, pages 7.3 and 7.4&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian engineer [[Paul Eisler]] invented the printed circuit as part of a [[radio]] set while working in the UK around 1936. In 1941 a multi-layer printed circuit was used in German magnetic influence naval mines. Around 1943 the USA began to use the technology on a large scale to make [[proximity fuse]]s for use in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Harper03" /&gt; After the war, in 1948, the USA released the invention for commercial use. Printed circuits did not become commonplace in consumer electronics until the mid-1950s, after the ''Auto-Sembly'' process was developed by the [[United States Army]]. At around the same time in the UK work along similar lines was carried out by [[Geoffrey Dummer]], then at the [[Royal Radar Establishment|RRDE]].

Even as circuit boards became available, the point-to-point chassis construction method remained in common use in industry (such as TV and hi-fi sets) into at least the late 1960s. Printed circuit boards were introduced to  reduce the size, weight, and cost of parts of the circuitry. In 1960, a small consumer radio receiver might be built with all its circuitry on one circuit board, but a TV set would probably contain  one or more circuit boards.

[[File:Hand Etched PCB.png|thumb|An example of hand-drawn etched traces on a PCB]]

Predating the printed circuit invention, and similar in spirit, was [[John Sargrove]]'s 1936–1947 Electronic Circuit Making Equipment (ECME) which sprayed metal onto a [[Bakelite]] plastic board. The ECME could produce three radio boards per minute.

During World War II, the development of the anti-aircraft [[proximity fuse]] required an electronic circuit that could withstand being fired from a gun, and could be produced in quantity. The Centralab Division of Globe Union submitted a proposal which met the requirements: a ceramic plate would be [[screenprinting|screenprinted]] with metallic paint for conductors and carbon material for [[resistor]]s, with ceramic disc capacitors and subminiature vacuum tubes soldered in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Brunetti| first = Cledo | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = New Advances in Printed Circuits | publisher = National Bureau of Standards | date = 22 November 1948 | location = Washington DC | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique proved viable, and the resulting patent on the process, which was classified by the U.S. Army, was assigned to Globe Union. It was not until 1984 that the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)]] awarded Mr. Harry W. Rubinstein the [[IEEE Cledo Brunetti Award|Cledo Brunetti Award]] for early key contributions to the development of printed components and conductors on a common insulating substrate.

[[File:PCB design and realisation smt and through hole.png|thumb|A PCB as a design on a computer (left) and realized as a board assembly populated with components (right). The board is double sided, with through-hole plating, green solder resist and a white legend. Both surface mount and through-hole components have been used.]]

Originally, every electronic component had wire leads, and a PCB had holes drilled for each wire of each component. The component leads were then inserted through the holes and [[solder]]ed to the copper PCB traces. This method of assembly is called [[Through-hole technology|''through-hole'' construction]]. In 1949, Moe Abramson and Stanislaus F. Danko of the [[United States Army Signal Corps]] developed the ''Auto-Sembly'' process in which component leads were inserted into a copper foil interconnection pattern and [[Dip soldering|dip soldered]]. The patent they obtained in 1956 was assigned to the U.S. Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent|US|2756485}} assigned to US Army. July 31, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; With the development of board lamination and etching techniques, this concept evolved into the standard printed circuit board fabrication process in use today. Soldering could be done automatically by passing the board over a ripple, or wave, of molten solder in a [[Wave soldering|wave-soldering]] machine. However, the wires and holes are inefficient since drilling holes is expensive and consumes drill bits and the protruding wires are cut off and discarded.

From the 1980s onward, small surface mount parts have been used increasingly instead of through-hole components; this has led to smaller boards for a given functionality and lower production costs, but with some additional difficulty in servicing faulty boards.

In the 1990s the use of multilayer surface boards became more frequent. As a result, size was further minimized and both flexible and rigid PCBs were incorporated in different devices. In 1995 PCB manufacturers began using microvia technology to produce High-Density Interconnect (HDI) PCBs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://falconerelectronics.com/history-of-circuit-boards/|title=History of Circuit Boards Through the 20th Century|date=2017-08-18|work=Falconer Electronics|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference | number = 5434751 | issue-date = 18 July 1995 | inventor = Herbert S. Cole, Jr., Theresa A. Sitnik-Nieters, Robert J. Wojnarowski, John H. Lupinski | title = Reworkable high density interconnect structure incorporating a release layer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HDI technology allows for a denser design on the PCB and significantly smaller components. As a result, components can be closer and the paths between them shorter. HDIs use blind/buried vias, or a combination that includes microvias. With multi-layer HDI PCBs the interconnection of stacked vias is even stronger, thus enhancing reliability in all conditions. The most common applications for HDI technology are computer and mobile phone components as well as medical equipment and military communication equipment. A 4-layer HDI microvia PCB Cost is equivalent in quality to an 8-layer through-hole PCB. However, the cost is much lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.creativehitech.com/blog/rise-high-density-interconnect-pcbs/|title=The Rise of High Density Interconnect PCBs - HDI PCBs|website=www.creativehitech.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.manufacturing.net/blog/2017/10/4-new-technologies-changing-pcb-market|title=4 New Technologies Changing The PCB Market|date=2017-10-26|work=Manufacturing.net|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent advances in 3D printing have meant that there are several new techniques in PCB creation. 3D printed electronics (PEs) can be utilized to print items layer by layer and subsequently the item can be printed with a liquid ink that contains electronic functionalities.

Manufacturers may not support component-level repair of printed circuit boards because of the relatively low cost to replace compared with the time and cost of troubleshooting to a component level. In board-level repair, the technician identifies the board (PCA) on which the fault resides and replaces it. This shift is economically efficient from a manufacturer's point of view but is also materially wasteful, as a circuit board with hundreds of good components may be discarded and replaced due to the failure of one minor and inexpensive part such as a resistor or capacitor. This practice is a significant contributor to the problem of [[e-waste]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Overview==
A basic PCB consists of a flat sheet of insulating material and a layer of copper foil, laminated to the substrate. Chemical etching divides the copper into separate conducting lines called tracks or ''circuit traces'', pads for connections, vias to pass connections between layers of copper, and features such as solid conductive areas for EM shielding or other purposes. The tracks function as wires fixed in place, and are insulated from each other by air and the board substrate material.  The surface of a PCB may have a coating that protects the copper from corrosion and reduces the chances of solder shorts between traces or undesired electrical contact with stray bare wires. For its function in helping to prevent solder shorts, the coating is called solder resist.

A printed circuit board can have multiple copper layers.  A two-layer board has copper on both sides; multi layer boards sandwich additional copper layers between layers of insulating material. Conductors on different layers are connected with [[via (electronics)|vias]], which are copper-plated holes that function as electrical tunnels through the insulating substrate. Through-hole component leads sometimes also effectively function as vias.  After two-layer PCBs, the next step up is usually four-layer. Often two layers are dedicated as power supply and ground planes, and the other two are used for signal wiring between components.

"Through hole" components are mounted by their wire leads passing through the board and soldered to traces on the other side. "Surface mount" components are attached by their leads to copper traces on the same side of the board.  A board may use both methods for mounting components. PCBs with only through-hole mounted components are now uncommon. Surface mounting is used for transistors, diodes, IC chips, resistors and capacitors. Through-hole mounting may be used for some large components such as electrolytic capacitors and connectors.

The  pattern to be etched into each copper layer of a PCB is called the "artwork".  The etching is usually done using [[photoresist]] which is coated onto the PCB, then exposed to light projected in the pattern of the artwork. The resist material protects the copper from dissolution into the etching solution.  The etched board is then cleaned. A PCB design can be mass-reproduced in a way similar to the way photographs can be mass-duplicated from film negatives using a photographic printer.

In multi-layer boards, the layers of material are laminated together in an alternating sandwich: copper, substrate, copper, substrate, copper, etc.; each plane of copper is etched, and any internal vias (that will not extend to both outer surfaces of the finished multilayer board) are plated-through, before the layers are laminated together. Only the outer layers need be coated; the inner copper layers are protected by the adjacent substrate layers.

[[FR-4]] [[Fibre-reinforced plastic|glass epoxy]] is the most common insulating substrate. Another substrate material is cotton paper impregnated with phenolic resin, often tan or brown.

When a PCB has no components installed, it is less ambiguously called a ''printed wiring board'' (''PWB'') or ''etched wiring board''. However, the term "printed wiring board" has fallen into disuse. A PCB populated with electronic components is called a ''printed circuit assembly'' (''PCA''), ''printed circuit board assembly'' or ''PCB assembly'' (''PCBA''). In informal usage, the term "printed circuit board" most commonly means "printed circuit assembly" (with components). The [[IPC (electronics)|IPC]] preferred term for assembled boards is ''circuit card assembly'' (''CCA''),&lt;ref&gt;IPC-14.38&lt;/ref&gt; and for assembled [[backplane]]s it is ''backplane assemblies''. "Card" is another widely used informal term for a "printed circuit assembly".

A PCB may be "silkscreen" printed with a legend  identifying the components, test points, or identifying text. Originally, an actual silkscreen printing process was used for this purpose, but today other, finer quality printing methods are usually used instead.  Normally the screen printing is not significant to the function of the PCBA.

A minimal PCB for a single component, used for prototyping, is called a ''breakout board''. The purpose of a breakout board is to "break out" the leads of a component on separate terminals so that manual connections to them can be made easily. Breakout boards are especially used for surface-mount components or any components with fine lead pitch.

Advanced PCBs may contain components embedded in the substrate.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

==Characteristics==
===Through-hole technology===
{{Main article|Through-hole technology}}
[[File:Resistors (1).jpg|thumb|Through-hole (leaded) resistors]]

The first PCBs used through-hole technology, mounting electronic components by [[Lead (electronics)|lead]]s inserted through holes on one side of the board and soldered onto copper traces on the other side. Boards may be single-sided, with an unplated component side, or more compact double-sided boards, with components soldered on both sides.  Horizontal installation of through-hole parts with two axial leads (such as resistors, capacitors, and diodes) is done by bending the leads 90 degrees in the same direction, inserting the part in the board (often bending leads located on the back of the board in opposite directions to improve the part's mechanical strength), soldering the leads, and trimming off the ends. Leads may be [[Soldering|soldered]] either manually or by a [[wave soldering]] machine.&lt;ref name= MAT2001&gt;''Electronic Packaging:Solder Mounting Technologies'' in K.H. Buschow et al (ed), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TyVVAAAAMAAJ Encyclopedia of Materials:Science and Technology]'', Elsevier, 2001 {{ISBN|0-08-043152-6}},  pages 2708–2709&lt;/ref&gt;

Through-hole manufacture adds to board cost by requiring many holes to be drilled accurately, and it limits the available routing area for [[signal trace]]s on layers immediately below the top layer on multi-layer boards, since the holes must pass through all layers to the opposite side. Once surface-mounting came into use, small-sized SMD components were used where possible, with through-hole mounting only of components unsuitably large for surface-mounting due to power requirements or mechanical limitations, or subject to mechanical stress which might damage the PCB (e.g. by lifting the copper off the board surface).{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Surface-mount technology===
{{Main article|Surface-mount technology}}
[[File:Surface Mount Components.jpg|thumb|Surface mount components, including resistors, [[transistor]]s and an integrated circuit]]

Surface-mount technology emerged in the 1960s, gained momentum in the early 1980s and became widely used by the mid-1990s.
Components were mechanically redesigned to have small metal tabs or end caps that could be soldered directly onto the PCB surface, instead of wire leads to pass through holes.  Components became much smaller and component placement on both sides of the board became more common than with through-hole mounting, allowing much smaller PCB assemblies with much higher circuit densities.
Surface mounting lends itself well to a high degree of automation, reducing labor costs and greatly increasing production rates.  Components can be supplied mounted on carrier tapes. Surface mount components can be about one-quarter to one-tenth of the size and weight of through-hole components, and passive components much cheaper.  However, prices of semiconductor [[surface mount device]]s (SMDs) are determined more by the chip itself than the package, with little price advantage over larger packages, and some wire-ended components, such as [[1N4148 signal diode|1N4148]] small-signal switch diodes, are actually significantly cheaper than SMD equivalents.

===Circuit properties of the PCB===
Each trace consists of a flat, narrow part of the [[copper]] foil that remains after etching. Its [[electrical resistance|resistance]], determined by its width, thickness, and length, must be sufficiently low for the current the conductor will carry. Power and ground traces may need to be wider than signal traces. In a multi-layer board one entire layer may be mostly solid copper to act as a [[ground plane]] for shielding and power return. For [[microwave]] circuits, [[transmission line]]s can be laid out in [[planar transmission line|a planar form]] such as [[stripline]] or [[microstrip]] with carefully controlled dimensions to assure a consistent [[Characteristic impedance|impedance]]. In radio-frequency and fast switching circuits the [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]] of the printed circuit board conductors become significant circuit elements, usually undesired; conversely, they can be used as a deliberate part of the circuit design, as in [[Distributed element filter]]s, obviating the need for additional discrete components.

===Materials===
====RoHS compliant PCB====

The European Union bans the use of lead (among other heavy metals) in consumer items, a piece of legislature called the [[RoHS]], for Restriction of Hazardous Substances, directive. PCBs to be sold in the EU must be RoHS-compliant, meaning that all manufacturing processes must not involve the use of lead, all solder used must be lead-free, and all components mounted on the board must be free of lead, mercury, cadmium, and other heavy metals.&lt;ref&gt;1.	“You Are HereDEQ Pollutants and Toxicants Environmental Lead (Pb).” DEQ - How Does Lead Affect Our Environment?, Agency: Environmental Quality, www.michigan.gov/deq/0,4561,7-135-3307_29693_30031-90418--,00.html. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2.	“RoHS Guide.” RoHS Compliance Guide: FAQ on RoHS Compliance, www.rohsguide.com/rohs-faq.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Laminates====
Laminates are manufactured by curing under pressure and temperature layers of cloth or paper with [[thermoset]] [[resin]] to form an integral final piece of uniform thickness. The size can be up to {{Convert|4|by|8|ft|m}} in width and length.  Varying cloth weaves (threads per inch or cm), cloth thickness, and resin percentage are used to achieve the desired final thickness and [[dielectric]] characteristics. Available standard laminate thickness are listed in
ANSI/IPC-D-275.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Design Standard for Rigid Printed Boards and Rigid Printed Board Assemblies|id=IPC-4101|publisher=IPC|date=September 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cloth or fiber material used, resin material, and the cloth to resin ratio determine the laminate's type designation (FR-4, CEM-1, G-10, etc.) and therefore the characteristics of the laminate produced. Important characteristics are the level to which the laminate is [[fire retardant]], the [[dielectric constant]] (e&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;), the [[loss factor]] (tδ), the [[tensile strength]], the [[shear strength]], the [[glass transition temperature]] (T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;), and the Z-axis [[coefficient of expansion|expansion coefficient]] (how much the thickness changes with temperature).

There are quite a few different dielectrics that can be chosen to provide different insulating values depending on the requirements of the circuit. Some of these dielectrics are [[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (Teflon), FR-4, FR-1, CEM-1 or CEM-3. Well known pre-preg materials used in the PCB industry are [[FR-2]] (phenolic cotton paper), FR-3 (cotton paper and epoxy), [[FR-4]] (woven glass and epoxy), FR-5 (woven glass and epoxy), FR-6 (matte glass and polyester), G-10 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-1 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-2 (cotton paper and epoxy), CEM-3 (non-woven glass and epoxy), CEM-4 (woven glass and epoxy), CEM-5 (woven glass and polyester). Thermal expansion is an important consideration especially with [[ball grid array]] (BGA) and naked die technologies, and glass fiber offers the best dimensional stability.

FR-4 is by far the most common material used today. The board stock with unetched copper on it is called "copper-clad laminate".

With decreasing size of board features and increasing frequencies, small nonhomogeneities like uneven distribution of fiberglass or other filler, thickness variations, and bubbles in the resin matrix, and the associated local variations in the dielectric constant, are gaining importance.

====Key substrate parameters====
The circuitboard substrates are usually dielectric composite materials. The composites contain a matrix (usually an epoxy resin) and a reinforcement (usually a woven, sometimes nonwoven, glass fibers, sometimes even paper), and in some cases a filler is added to the resin (e.g. ceramics; titanate ceramics can be used to increase the dielectric constant).

The reinforcement type defines two major classes of materials: woven and non-woven. Woven reinforcements are cheaper, but the high dielectric constant of glass may not be favorable for many higher-frequency applications. The spatially nonhomogeneous structure also introduces local variations in electrical parameters, due to different resin/glass ratio at different areas of the weave pattern. Nonwoven reinforcements, or materials with low or no reinforcement, are more expensive but more suitable for some RF/analog applications.

The substrates are characterized by several key parameters, chiefly thermomechanical ([[glass transition temperature]], [[tensile strength]], [[shear strength]], [[thermal expansion]]), electrical ([[dielectric constant]], [[loss tangent]], [[breakdown voltage|dielectric breakdown voltage]], [[leakage current]], [[tracking resistance]]...), and others (e.g. [[moisture absorption]]).

At the [[glass transition temperature]] the resin in the composite softens and significantly increases thermal expansion; exceeding T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; then exerts mechanical overload on the board components - e.g. the joints and the vias. Below T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; the thermal expansion of the resin roughly matches copper and glass, above it gets significantly higher. As the reinforcement and copper confine the board along the plane, virtually all volume expansion projects to the thickness and stresses the plated-through holes. Repeated soldering or other exposition to higher temperatures can cause failure of the plating, especially with thicker boards; thick boards therefore require a matrix with a high T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;.

The materials used determine the substrate's dielectric constant. This constant is also dependent on frequency, usually decreasing with frequency. As this constant determines the [[phase velocity|signal propagation speed]], frequency dependence introduces phase distortion in wideband applications; as flat a dielectric constant vs frequency characteristics as is achievable is important here. The impedance of transmission lines decreases with frequency, therefore faster edges of signals reflect more than slower ones.

Dielectric breakdown voltage determines the maximum voltage gradient the material can be subjected to before suffering a breakdown (conduction, or arcing, through the dielectric).

Tracking resistance determines how the material resists high voltage electrical discharges creeping over the board surface.

Loss tangent determines how much of the electromagnetic energy from the signals in the conductors is absorbed in the board material. This factor is important for high frequencies. Low-loss materials are more expensive. Choosing unnecessarily low-loss material is a common engineering error in high-frequency digital design; it increases the cost of the boards without a corresponding benefit. Signal degradation by loss tangent and dielectric constant can be easily assessed by an [[eye pattern]].

Moisture absorption occurs when the material is exposed to high humidity or water. Both the resin and the reinforcement may absorb water; water also may be soaked by capillary forces through voids in the materials and along the reinforcement. Epoxies of the FR-4 materials aren't too susceptible, with absorption of only 0.15%. Teflon has very low absorption of 0.01%. Polyimides and cyanate esters, on the other side, suffer from high water absorption. Absorbed water can lead to significant degradation of key parameters; it impairs tracking resistance, breakdown voltage, and dielectric parameters. Relative dielectric constant of water is about 73, compared to about 4 for common circuit board materials. Absorbed moisture can also vaporize on heating, as during soldering, and cause cracking and delamination,&lt;ref&gt;Sood, B. and Pecht, M. 2011. Printed Circuit Board Laminates. Wiley Encyclopedia of Composites. 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt; the same effect responsible for "popcorning" damage on wet packaging of electronic parts. Careful baking of the substrates may be required to dry them prior to soldering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=By Lee W.

====Common substrates====
Often encountered materials:
* [[FR-2]], [[phenolic paper]] or phenolic cotton paper, paper impregnated with a [[phenol formaldehyde resin]]. Common in consumer electronics with single-sided boards. Electrical properties inferior to FR-4. Poor arc resistance. Generally rated to 105&amp;nbsp;°C.

* [[Aluminum]], or ''metal core board'' or [[insulated metal substrate]] (IMS), clad with thermally conductive thin dielectric - used for parts requiring significant cooling - power switches, LEDs. Consists of usually single, sometimes double layer thin circuit board based on e.g. FR-4, laminated on aluminum sheet metal, commonly 0.8, 1, 1.5, 2 or 3&amp;nbsp;mm thick. The thicker laminates sometimes also come with thicker copper metalization.

* [[Polyimide]], a high-temperature polymer. Expensive, high-performance. Higher water absorption (0.4%). Can be used from cryogenic temperatures to over 260&amp;nbsp;°C.

====Copper thickness====
Copper thickness of PCBs can be specified directly or as the weight of copper per area (in ounce per square foot) which is easier to measure. One [[ounce]] per [[square foot]] is 1.344 mils or 34 micrometers thickness. ''Heavy copper'' is a layer exceeding three ounces of copper per ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, or approximately 0.0042&amp;nbsp;inches (4.2&amp;nbsp;mils, 105&amp;nbsp;μm) thick.  Heavy copper layers are used for high current or  to help dissipate heat.

On the common FR-4 substrates, 1 [[Ounce|oz]] copper per ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (35&amp;nbsp;µm) is the most common thickness; 2 oz (70&amp;nbsp;µm) and 0.5 oz (18&amp;nbsp;µm) thickness is often an option. Less common are 12 and 105&amp;nbsp;µm, 9&amp;nbsp;µm is sometimes available on some substrates. Flexible substrates typically have thinner metalization. Metal-core boards for high power devices commonly use thicker copper; 35&amp;nbsp;µm is usual but also 140 and 400&amp;nbsp;µm can be encountered.

====Safety certification (US)====
Safety Standard UL 796 covers component safety requirements for printed wiring boards for use as components in devices or appliances. Testing analyzes characteristics such as flammability, maximum [[operating temperature]], electrical tracking, heat deflection, and direct support of live electrical parts.

[[File:S111FlipChipBack.jpg|thumb|A board designed in 1967; the sweeping curves in the traces are evidence of freehand design using adhesive tape]]

Initially PCBs were designed manually by creating a [[photomask]] on a clear [[mylar]] sheet, usually at two or four times the true size. Starting from the schematic diagram the component pin pads were laid out on the mylar and then traces were routed to connect the pads. Rub-on [[dry transfer]]s of common component footprints increased efficiency. Traces were made with self-adhesive tape. Pre-printed non-reproducing grids on the mylar assisted in layout. The finished photomask was [[Photolithography|photolithographically]] reproduced onto a photoresist coating on the blank copper-clad boards.

Modern PCBs are designed with dedicated layout software, generally in the following steps:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~prabal/teaching/cs194-05-s08/cs194-designflow.ppt Printed Circuit Board Design Flow Methodology]&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Schematic capture]] through an [[electronic design automation]] (''EDA'') tool.
# Card dimensions and template are decided based on required circuitry and case of the PCB.
# The positions of the components and [[heat sink]]s are determined.
# Layer stack of the PCB is decided, with one to tens of layers depending on complexity. [[Ground plane|Ground]] and [[power plane]]s are decided. A power plane is the counterpart to a ground plane and behaves as an [[alternating current|AC]] signal ground while providing DC power to the circuits mounted on the PCB. Signal interconnections are traced on signal planes. Signal planes can be on the outer as well as inner layers. For optimal [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI]] performance high frequency signals are routed in internal layers between power or ground planes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lg-advice.ro/pdf/IPC-2251-cuprins.pdf|title=See appendix D of IPC-2251|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing==
{{anchor|pcbmanufac}}

PCB manufacturing consists of many steps.

===PCB CAM===
Manufacturing starts from the fabrication data generated by [[computer aided design]], and component information. The  fabrication data is read into the CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing) software. CAM performs the following functions:

# Input of the fabrication data.
# Verification of the data
# Compensation for deviations in the manufacturing processes (e.g. scaling to compensate for distortions during lamination)
# Panelization
# Output of the digital tools (copper patterns, drill files, inspection, and others)

===Panelization===
Several small printed circuit boards can be grouped together for processing as a panel. A panel consisting of a design duplicated ''n''-times is also called an ''n''-panel, whereas a ''multi-panel'' combines several different design onto a single panel. The outer tooling strip often includes [[tooling hole]]s, a set of [[panel fiducial]]s, a [[test coupon (PCB)|test coupon]], and may include [[hatched copper pour]] or similar patterns for even copper distribution over the whole panel in order to avoid bending. The assemblers often mount components on panels rather than single PCBs because this is efficient.

The panel is eventually broken into individual PCBs along perforations or grooves in the panel.&lt;ref&gt;Kraig Mitzner, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=z7RCh8bK6_8C Complete PCB Design Using OrCad Capture and Layout]'', pages 443–446, Newnes, 2011 {{ISBN|0080549209}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today depaneling is often done by lasers which cut the board with no contact. Laser depaneling reduces stress on the fragile circuits, improving the yield of defect-free units.

===Copper patterning===
The first step is to replicate the pattern in the fabricator's CAM system on a protective mask on the copper foil PCB layers.  Subsequent etching removes the unwanted copper. (Alternatively, a conductive ink can be ink-jetted on a blank (non-conductive) board. This technique is also used in the manufacture of [[hybrid circuit]]s.)
# '''[[Silk screen|Silk screen printing]]''' uses etch-resistant inks to create the protective mask.
# '''[[Photoengraving]]''' uses a photomask and developer to selectively remove a UV-sensitive photoresist coating and thus create a photoresist mask. Direct imaging techniques are sometimes used for high-resolution requirements. Experiments were made with thermal resist.&lt;ref name="Thermal DI"&gt;{{cite web
 |title=Liquid Photoresists for Thermal Direct Imaging
 |authors=Itshak Taff, Hai Benron
 |publisher=The Board Authority, October 1999
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[PCB Milling|PCB milling]]''' uses a two or three-axis mechanical milling system to mill away the copper foil from the substrate. A PCB milling machine (referred to as a 'PCB Prototyper') operates in a similar way to a [[plotter]], receiving commands from the host software that control the position of the milling head in the x, y, and (if relevant) z axis.
# '''Laser resist ablation''' Spray black paint onto copper clad laminate, place into [[CNC]] laser plotter. The laser raster-scans the PCB and ablates (vaporizes) the paint where no resist is wanted. (Note: laser copper ablation is rarely used and is considered experimental.{{Clarify|date=April 2012|reason=is laser COPPER ablation distinct from resist ablation, and experimental?}})
# '''Laser etching''' The copper may be removed directly by a CNC laser.  Like PCB milling above this is used mainly for prototyping.

The method chosen depends on the  number of boards to be produced and the required resolution.

====Large volume====
* Silk screen printing – Used for PCBs with bigger features
* Photoengraving – Used when finer features are required

====Small volume====
* Print onto transparent film and use as photo mask along with photo-sensitized boards, then etch. (Alternatively, use a film photoplotter)
* Laser resist ablation
* PCB milling
* Laser etching

====Hobbyist====
* Laser-printed resist: Laser-print onto toner transfer paper, heat-transfer with an iron or modified laminator onto bare laminate, soak in water bath, touch up with a marker, then etch.
* Vinyl film and resist, non-washable marker, some other methods. Labor-intensive, only suitable for single boards.

===Subtractive, additive and semi-additive processes===
[[File:Double side PCB process flow chart.png|thumb|upright=1.5|The two processing methods used to produce a double-sided PWB with plated-through holes]]

Subtractive methods remove copper from an entirely copper-coated board to leave only the desired copper pattern.  In additive methods the pattern is [[Electroplating|electroplated]] onto a bare substrate using a complex process. The advantage of the additive method is that less material is needed and less waste is produced. In the full additive process the bare laminate is covered with a photosensitive film which is imaged (exposed to light through a mask and then developed which removes the unexposed film).  The exposed areas are sensitized in a chemical bath, usually containing palladium and similar to that used for through hole plating which makes the exposed area capable of bonding metal ions.  The laminate is then plated with copper in the sensitized areas.  When the mask is stripped, the PCB is finished.

Semi-additive is the most common process: The unpatterned board has a thin layer of copper already on it. A reverse mask is then applied. (Unlike a subtractive process mask, this mask exposes those parts of the substrate that will eventually become the traces.) Additional copper is then plated onto the board in the unmasked areas; copper may be plated to any desired weight. Tin-lead or other surface platings are then applied. The mask is stripped away and a brief etching step removes the now-exposed bare original copper laminate from the board, isolating the individual traces.  Some single-sided boards which have plated-through holes are made in this way.  [[General Electric]] made consumer radio sets in the late 1960s using additive boards.

The (semi-)additive process is commonly used for multi-layer boards as it facilitates the [[plating]]-through of the holes to produce conductive [[via (electronics)|vias]] in the circuit board.

===Chemical etching===
[[Industrial etching|Chemical etching]] is usually done with [[ammonium persulfate]] or [[ferric chloride]]. For PTH (plated-through holes), additional steps of [[Electroplating#Electroless deposition|electroless deposition]] are done after the holes are drilled, then copper is electroplated to build up the thickness, the boards are screened, and plated with tin/lead. The tin/lead becomes the resist leaving the bare copper to be etched away.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mFjuCAAAQBAJ|title=The Electronics Assembly Handbook|last=Riley|first=Frank|last2=Production|first2=Electronic Packaging and|date=2013-06-29|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|year=|isbn=9783662131619|location=|pages=285|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplest method, used for small-scale production and often by hobbyists, is immersion etching, in which the board is submerged in etching solution such as ferric chloride. Compared with methods used for mass production, the etching time is long.  Heat and agitation can be applied to the bath to speed the etching rate. In bubble etching, air is passed through the etchant bath to agitate the solution and speed up etching. Splash etching uses a motor-driven paddle to splash boards with etchant; the process has become commercially obsolete since it is not as fast as spray etching. In spray etching, the etchant solution is distributed over the boards by nozzles, and recirculated by pumps. Adjustment of the nozzle pattern, flow rate, temperature, and etchant composition gives predictable control of etching rates and high production rates.&lt;ref name="Khandpur05"&gt;R. S. Khandpur,''[https://books.google.com.bd/books/about/Printed_Circuit_Boards.html?id=VY8iBAAAQBAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Printed circuit boards: design, fabrication, assembly and testing]'', Tata-McGraw Hill, 2005 {{ISBN|0-07-058814-7}}, pages 373–378&lt;/ref&gt;

As more copper is consumed from the boards, the etchant becomes saturated and less effective; different etchants have different capacities for copper, with some as high as 150 grams of copper per litre of solution. In commercial use, etchants can be regenerated to restore their activity, and the dissolved copper recovered and sold.  Small-scale etching requires attention to disposal of used etchant, which is corrosive and toxic due to its metal content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6OwRb7N3j14C|title=Printed Circuit Boards: Design and Technology|last=Bosshart|first=|date=1983-01-01|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|year=|isbn=9780074515495|location=|pages=298|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The etchant removes copper on all surfaces exposed by the resist.  "Undercut" occurs when etchant attacks the thin edge of copper under the resist; this can reduce conductor widths and cause open-circuits. Careful control of etch time is required to prevent undercut.  Where metallic plating is used as a resist, it can "overhang" which can cause short-circuits between adjacent traces when closely spaced. Overhang can be removed by wire-brushing the board after etching.&lt;ref name=Khandpur05 /&gt;

==={{Anchor|multi-layer}}Lamination===
[[File:Bga und via IMGP4531 wp.jpg|thumb|Cut through a SDRAM-module, a multi-layer PCB. Note the [[Via (electronics)|via]], visible as a bright copper-colored band running between the top and bottom layers of the board.]]

Multi-layer printed circuit boards have trace layers inside the board. This is achieved by laminating a stack of materials in a press by applying pressure and heat for a period of time. This results in an inseparable one piece product. For example, a four-layer PCB can be fabricated by starting from a two-sided copper-clad laminate, etch the circuitry on both sides, then laminate to the top and bottom pre-preg and copper foil. It is then drilled, plated, and etched again to get traces on top and bottom layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://learnemc.com/pcb-layout|title=PCB Layout|accessdate=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inner layers are given a complete machine inspection before lamination because afterwards mistakes cannot be corrected. The automatic optical inspection system compares an image of the board with the digital image generated from the original design data.

===Drilling===
[[File:Ni000 Hollow rivets for Plated Through Hole PCB repair and small-scale manufacturing.png|thumb|Eyelets (hollow)]]

Holes through a PCB are typically drilled with [[drill bit]]s made of solid coated [[tungsten carbide]]. Coated tungsten carbide is used because board materials are abrasive.  High-speed-steel bits would dull quickly, tearing the copper and ruining the board. Drilling is done by computer-controlled drilling machines, using a ''drill file'' or [[Excellon file]] that describes the location and size of each drilled hole.

Holes may be made conductive, by electroplating or inserting hollow metal eyelets, to connect board layers. Some conductive holes are intended for the insertion of through-hole-component leads. Others used to connect board layers, are called [[Via (electronics)|vias]].

When very small vias are required, drilling with mechanical bits is costly because of high rates of wear and breakage. In this case, the vias may be [[laser drilling|laser drilled]]—evaporated by [[laser]]s. Laser-drilled vias typically have an inferior surface finish inside the hole. These holes are called ''micro vias''.  It is also possible with ''controlled-depth'' drilling, laser drilling, or by pre-drilling the individual sheets of the PCB before lamination, to produce holes that connect only some of the copper layers, rather than passing through the entire board. These holes are called ''blind vias'' when they connect an internal copper layer to an outer layer, or ''buried vias'' when they connect two or more internal copper layers and no outer layers.

The hole walls for boards with two or more layers can be made conductive and then electroplated with copper to form ''plated-through holes''. These holes electrically connect the conducting layers of the PCB. For multi-layer boards, those with three layers or more, drilling typically produces a ''smear'' of the high temperature decomposition products of bonding agent in the laminate system. Before the holes can be plated through, this smear must be removed by a chemical ''de-smear'' process, or by ''plasma-etch''. The de-smear process ensures that a good connection is made to the copper layers when the hole is plated through. On high reliability boards a process called etch-back is performed chemically with a potassium permanganate based etchant or plasma. The etch-back removes resin and the glass fibers so that the copper layers extend into the hole and as the hole is plated become integral with the deposited copper.

===Plating and coating===
Proper plating or surface finish selection can be critical to process yield, the amount of rework, field failure rate, and reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Resources/services/Selecting-a-PCB-Surface-Finish.pdf?t=1509023781105|title=Considerations for Selecting a PCB Surface Finish|last=|first=|date=8 October 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCBs are plated with solder, tin, or gold over nickel and a resist for [[etching]] away the unneeded underlying copper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=11515&amp;page=77 Appendix F Sample Fabrication Sequence for a Standard Printed Circuit Board], Linkages: Manufacturing Trends in Electronics Interconnection Technology, National Academy of Sciences&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://epa.gov/dfe/pubs/pwb/tech_rep/p2_report/p2_sec3.htm Production Methods and Materials 3.1 General] Printed Wiring Board Project Report – Table of Contents, Design for the Environment (DfE), US EPA&lt;/ref&gt;

After PCBs are etched and then rinsed with water, the solder mask is applied, and then any exposed copper is coated with solder, nickel/gold, or some other anti-corrosion coating.&lt;ref&gt;George Milad and Don Gudeczauskas. "[http://www.uyemura.com/solder-joint-reliability-of-gold-surface-finishes-ENIG-ENEPIG-DIG.htm Solder Joint Reliability of Gold Surface Finishes (ENIG, ENEPIG and DIG) for PWB Assembled with Lead Free SAC Alloy]."
&lt;/ref&gt;

Matte solder is usually fused to provide a better bonding surface for bare copper. Treatments, such as [[benzimidazolethiol]], prevent surface oxidation of bare copper. The places to which components will be mounted are typically plated, because untreated bare copper oxidizes quickly, and therefore is not readily solderable. Traditionally, any exposed copper was coated with solder by [[hot air solder levelling]] (HASL). The HASL finish prevents oxidation from the underlying copper, thereby guaranteeing a solderable surface. This solder was a [[tin]]-[[lead]] alloy, however new solder compounds are now used to achieve compliance with the [[RoHS]] directive in the [[European Union|EU]], which restricts the use of lead. One of these lead-free compounds is SN100CL, made up of 99.3% tin, 0.7% copper, 0.05% nickel, and a nominal of 60&amp;nbsp;ppm germanium.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

It is important to use solder compatible with both the PCB and the parts used. An example is [[ball grid array]] (BGA) using tin-lead solder balls for connections losing their balls on bare copper traces or using lead-free solder paste.

Other platings used are OSP (organic surface protectant), immersion silver ([[IAg]]), immersion tin, electroless nickel with immersion gold coating ([[ENIG]]), electroless nickel electroless palladium immersion gold ([[ENEPIG]]) and direct [[gold plating]] (over nickel).  [[Edge connector]]s, placed along one edge of some boards, are often nickel-plated then [[gold-plated]]. Another coating consideration is rapid diffusion of coating metal into tin solder. Tin forms intermetallics such as Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and Ag&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cu that dissolve into the Tin liquidus or solidus(@50C), stripping surface coating or leaving voids.

''Electrochemical migration'' (ECM) is the growth of conductive metal filaments on or in a printed circuit board (PCB) under the influence of a DC voltage bias.&lt;ref&gt;[[IPC (electronics)|IPC]] Publication IPC-TR-476A, "Electrochemical Migration: Electrically Induced Failures in Printed Wiring Assemblies," Northbrook, IL, May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.Zhan, M. H. Azarian and M. Pecht, "[https://www.calce.umd.edu/articles/abstracts/2005/density.htm Reliability Issues of No-Clean Flux Technology with Lead-free Solder Alloy for High Density Printed Circuit Boards]", 38th International Symposium on Microelectronics, pp. 367–375, Philadelphia, PA, September 25–29, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Silver, zinc, and aluminum are known to grow [[Whisker (metallurgy)|whiskers]] under the influence of an electric field. Silver also grows conducting surface paths in the presence of halide and other ions, making it a poor choice for electronics use. Tin will grow "whiskers" due to tension in the plated surface. Tin-lead or solder plating also grows whiskers, only reduced by reducing the percentage of tin. Reflow to melt solder or tin plate to relieve surface stress lowers whisker incidence. Another coating issue is [[tin pest]], the transformation of tin to a powdery  allotrope at low temperature.&lt;ref&gt;Clyde F. Coombs ''Printed Circuits Handbook'' McGraw–Hill Professional, 2007 {{ISBN|0-07-146734-3}}, pages 45–19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solder resist application===
Areas that should not be soldered may be covered with [[solder mask|solder resist]] (solder mask). One of the most common solder resists used today is called "LPI" ([[liquid photoimageable solder mask]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coates.de/ccp/connections/liquid.pdf|title=liquid photoimageable solder masks|publisher=Coates Circuit Products|accessdate=2 Sep 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; A photo-sensitive coating is applied to the surface of the PWB, then exposed to light through the solder mask image film, and finally developed where the unexposed areas are washed away.  Dry film solder mask is similar to the dry film used to image the PWB for plating or etching.  After being laminated to the PWB surface it is imaged and developed as LPI.  Once but no longer commonly used, because of its low accuracy and resolution, is to screen print epoxy ink. In addition to repelling solder, solder resist also provides protection from the environment to the copper that would otherwise be exposed.

===Legend printing===
A legend is often printed on one or both sides of the PCB. It contains the [[Reference designator|component designators]], switch settings, test points and other indications helpful in assembling, testing, servicing, and sometimes using the circuit board.

There are three methods to print the legend.
#[[screen-printing|Silk screen printing]] epoxy ink was the established method. It was so common that legend is often misnamed silk or silkscreen.
#Liquid photo imaging is a more accurate method than screen printing.
#Ink jet printing is new but increasingly used. Ink jet can print variable data, unique to each PWB unit, such as text or a [[bar code]] with a [[serial number]].

===Bare-board test===
Boards with no components installed are usually ''bare-board tested'' for "shorts" and "opens". A short is a connection between two points that should not be connected. An open is a missing connection between points that should be connected. For high-volume production, a fixture or a [[rigid needle adapter]] makes contact with copper lands on the board. The fixture or adapter is a significant fixed cost and this method is only economical for high-volume or high-value production. For small or medium volume production ''[[flying probe]]'' testers are used where test probes are moved over the board by an XY drive to make contact with the copper lands. There is no need for a fixture and hence the fixed costs are much lower. The CAM system ''instructs'' the electrical tester to apply a voltage to each contact point as required and to check that this voltage appears on the appropriate contact points and only on these.

===Assembly===
[[File:Testpad.JPG|thumb|PCB with test connection pads]]
In assembly the bare board is populated (or "stuffed") with electronic components to form a functional ''printed circuit assembly'' (PCA), sometimes called a "printed circuit board assembly" (PCBA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ayob | first1 = M. | last2 = Kendall | first2 = G. | year = 2008 | title = A Survey of Surface Mount Device Placement Machine Optidmisation: Machine Classification | url = | journal = European Journal of Operational Research | volume = 186 | issue = 3| pages = 893–914 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejor.2007.03.042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ayob | first1 = M. | last2 = Kendall | first2 = G. | year = 2005 | title = A Triple Objective Function with a Chebychev Dynamic Pick-and-place Point Specification Approach to Optimise the Surface Mount Placement Machine | url = http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gxk/gxk1/../papers/mxaejor2005.pdf| journal = European Journal of Operational Research | volume = 164 | issue = 3| pages = 609–626 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejor.2003.09.034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[through-hole technology]], the component leads are inserted in holes surrounded by conductive ''pads''; the holes keep the components in place. In [[surface-mount technology]] (SMT), the component is placed on the PCB so that the pins line up with the conductive ''pads'' or ''lands'' on the surfaces of the PCB; solder paste, which was previously applied to the pads, holds the components in place temporarily; if surface-mount components are applied to both sides of the board, the bottom-side components are glued to the board. In both through hole and surface mount, the components are then [[soldering|soldered]]; once cooled and solidified, the solder holds the components in place permanently and electrically connects them to the board.

There are a variety of [[soldering]] techniques used to attach components to a PCB. High volume production is usually done with a "Pick and place machine" or [[SMT placement equipment|SMT placement machine]] and bulk wave soldering or [[reflow oven]]s, but skilled technicians are able to hand-solder very tiny parts (for instance 0201 packages which are 0.02 in. by 0.01 in.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.smta.org/files/smta_techscan_0201_overview.pdf |title=SMTA TechScan Compendium: 0201 Design, Assembly and Process |accessdate=2010-01-11 |last=Borkes |first=Tom |publisher=Surface Mount Technology Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; under a [[microscope]], using tweezers and a fine-tip [[soldering iron]], for small volume prototypes. Some SMT parts cannot be soldered by hand, such as [[ball grid array|BGA]] packages. All through-hole components can be hand soldered, making them favored for prototyping where size, weight, and the use of the exact components that would be used in high volume production are not concerns.

Often, through-hole and surface-mount construction must be combined in a single assembly because some required components are available only in surface-mount packages, while others are available only in through-hole packages. Or, even if all components are available in through-hole packages, it might be desired to take advantage of the size, weight, and cost reductions obtainable by using some available surface-mount devices. Another reason to use both methods is that through-hole mounting can provide needed strength for components likely to endure physical stress (such as connectors that are frequently mated and demated or that connect to cables expected to impart substantial stress to the PCB-and-connector interface), while components that are expected to go untouched will take up less space using surface-mount techniques. ''For further comparison, see the [[Surface-mount technology#Advantages|SMT page]].''

After the board has been populated it may be tested in a variety of ways:
* While the power is off, [[visual inspection]], [[automated optical inspection]]. [[JEDEC]] guidelines for PCB component placement, soldering, and inspection are commonly used to maintain [[quality control]] in this stage of PCB manufacturing.
* While the power is off, [[analog signature analysis]], [[power-off testing]].
* While the power is on, [[in-circuit test]], where physical measurements (for example, voltage) can be done.
* While the power is on, [[functional test]], just checking if the PCB does what it had been designed to do.
To facilitate these tests, PCBs may be designed with extra pads to make temporary connections. Sometimes these pads must be isolated with resistors. The in-circuit test may also exercise [[boundary scan]] test features of some components. In-circuit test systems may also be used to program nonvolatile memory components on the board.

In boundary scan testing, test circuits integrated into various ICs on the board form temporary connections between the PCB traces to test that the ICs are mounted correctly. Boundary scan testing requires that all the ICs to be tested use a standard test configuration procedure, the most common one being the Joint Test Action Group ([[JTAG]]) standard. The [[JTAG]] test architecture provides a means to test interconnects between integrated circuits on a board without using physical test probes, by using circuitry in the ICs to employ the IC pins themselves as test probes. [[JTAG]] tool vendors provide various types of stimuli and sophisticated algorithms, not only to detect the failing nets, but also to isolate the faults to specific nets, devices, and pins.

When boards fail the test, technicians may [[desoldering|desolder]] and replace failed components, a task known as ''[[Rework (electronics)|rework]]''.

===Protection and packaging===
PCBs intended for extreme environments often have a [[conformal coating]], which is applied by dipping or spraying after the components have been soldered. The coat prevents corrosion and leakage currents or shorting due to condensation. The earliest conformal coats were [[wax]]; modern conformal coats are usually dips of dilute solutions of silicone rubber, polyurethane, acrylic, or epoxy. Another technique for applying a conformal coating is for plastic to be [[sputter deposition|sputtered]] onto the PCB in a vacuum chamber. The chief disadvantage of conformal coatings is that servicing of the board is rendered extremely difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = Shibu | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Intro To Embedded Systems 1E | publisher = Tata McGraw-Hill | date = | location = | page = 293 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-07-014589-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many assembled PCBs are [[Electrostatic discharge|static]] sensitive, and therefore they must be placed in [[antistatic bag]]s during transport. When handling these boards, the user must be [[Ground (electricity)|grounded (earthed)]]. Improper handling techniques might transmit an accumulated static charge through the board, damaging or destroying components. The damage might not immediately affect function but might lead to early failure later on, cause intermittent operating faults, or cause a narrowing of the range of environmental and electrical conditions under which the board functions properly. Even bare boards are sometimes static sensitive: traces have become so fine that it's quite possible to blow an etch off the board (or change its characteristics) with a static charge. This is especially true on non-traditional PCBs such as [[Multi-Chip Module|MCMs]] and microwave PCBs.

==Cordwood construction==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
[[File:Cordwoodcircuit.agr.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A cordwood module]]
[[File:MK53 fuze.jpg|thumb|Cordwood construction was used in [[proximity fuze]]s.]]

Cordwood construction can save significant space and was often used with [[Through-hole technology|wire-ended components]] in applications where space was at a premium (such as [[fuze]]s, missile guidance, and telemetry systems) and in high-speed [[computer]]s, where short traces were important. In cordwood construction, axial-leaded components were mounted between two parallel planes. The components were either soldered together with jumper wire, or they were connected to other components by thin nickel ribbon welded at right angles onto the component leads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wagner |first=G. Donald |title=History of Electronic Packaging at APL: From the VT Fuze to the NEAR Spacecraft |journal=Johns Hopkins APL Technical Digest |volume=20 |issue=1 |date=1999 |url=http://www.jhuapl.edu/techdigest/TD/td2001/Wagner.pdf |accessdate=2016-12-19 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid shorting together different interconnection layers, thin insulating cards were placed between them. Perforations or holes in the cards allowed component leads to project through to the next interconnection layer. One disadvantage of this system was that special [[nickel]]-leaded components had to be used to allow the interconnecting welds to be made. Differential thermal expansion of the component could put pressure on the leads of the components and the PCB traces and cause mechanical damage (as was seen in several modules on the Apollo program). Additionally, components located in the interior are difficult to replace. Some versions of cordwood construction used soldered single-sided PCBs as the interconnection method (as pictured), allowing the use of normal-leaded components.

Before the advent of [[integrated circuit]]s, this method allowed the highest possible component packing density; because of this, it was used by a number of computer vendors including [[Control Data Corporation]]. The cordwood method of construction was used only rarely once semiconductor electronics and PCBs became widespread.

==Multiwire boards==
Multiwire is a patented technique of interconnection which uses machine-routed insulated wires embedded in a non-conducting matrix (often plastic resin). It was used during the 1980s and 1990s. (Kollmorgen Technologies Corp, {{US Patent|4175816}} filed 1978) As of 2010, Multiwire was still available through Hitachi.

Since it was quite easy to stack interconnections (wires) inside the embedding matrix, the approach allowed designers to forget completely about the routing of wires (usually a time-consuming operation of PCB design): Anywhere the designer needs a connection, the machine will draw a wire in a straight line from one location/pin to another. This led to very short design times (no complex algorithms to use even for high density designs) as well as reduced [[crosstalk]] (which is worse when wires run parallel to each other&amp;mdash;which almost never happens in Multiwire), though the cost is too high to compete with cheaper PCB technologies when large quantities are needed.

Corrections can be made to a Multiwire board more easily than to a PCB.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Weisberg.

&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other competitive discrete wiring technologies that have been developed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14289">'''Regenerative design''' is a process-oriented [[Systems theory|whole systems]] approach to [[Design thinking|design]]. The term "regenerative" describes processes that restore, renew or revitalize their own sources of energy and materials. Regenerative design uses whole systems thinking to create [[Ecological resilience|resilient]] and equitable systems that integrate the needs of [[society]] with the integrity of nature. 

Designers use [[Systems theory|systems thinking]], applied [[Permaculture|permaculture design]] principles, and [[community development]] processes to design human and [[ecological]] systems. The development of regenerative design has been influenced by approaches found in the [[biomimicry]], [[biophilic design]], [[Ecological economics|ecological economics,]] [[Circular economy|circular economics]]. As well as [[Social movement|social movements]] such as permaculture, [[Transition town|transition]] and the [[new economy]]. Regenerative design can also refer to process of designing systems such as [[restorative justice]], [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] and [[regenerative agriculture]].
[[File:Feedback loop.png|thumb|Feedback loop used in regenerative design]]
A new generation of designers are applying ecologically inspired design to [[agriculture]], architecture, [[community planning]], [[Sustainable urban planning|cities]], [[wikt:enterprise|enterprise]]s, [[economics]] and [[Systems ecology|ecosystem regeneration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.permaculture.co.uk/articles/designing-regenerative-cultures|title=Permaculture magazine|date=2016-06-18|work=Permaculture magazine|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many designers use the resilient models observed in [[systems ecology]] in their design process and recognize that [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] are [[Ecological resilience|resilient]] largely because they operate in [[closed ecological system|closed loop systems.]] Using this model regenerative design seeks feedback at every stage of the design process. [[Feedback]] loops are an integral to regenerative systems as understood by processes used in [[Restorative practices|restorative practice]] and [[community development]].

Regenerative design is interconnected with the approaches of systems thinking and with [[New Economy Coalition#New Economy movement|New Economy movement]]. The 'new economy' considers that the current economic system needs to be restructured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diebold|first=William|last2=Alperovitz|first2=Gar|last3=Faux|first3=Jeff|date=1984|title=Rebuilding America: A Blueprint for the New Economy|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/20042109|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=63|issue=1|pages=190|doi=10.2307/20042109|issn=0015-7120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is based on the assumption that people and the planet should come first, and that it is human well-being, not economic growth, which should be prioritized. 

Whereas the highest aim of [[sustainable development]] is to satisfy [[fundamental human needs]] today without compromising the possibility of future generations to satisfy theirs, the goal of regenerative design is to develop restorative systems that are dynamic and emergent, and are beneficial for humans and other species. This regeneration process is participatory, iterative and individual to the community and environment it is applied to. This process intends to revitalize communities, human and natural resources, and for some, society as a whole. 

In recent years regenerative design is made possible on a larger scale using open source socio- technicle platforms and technological systems as used in [[Smart city|SMART cities]]. It is an includes community and city development processes like gathering [[feedback]], [[Participatory democracy|participatory governance]], [[sortition]] and [[participatory budgeting]].

== History ==
During the late 1970s, [[John T. Lyle]] (1934–1998), a [[landscape architecture]] professor, challenged graduate students to envision a community in which daily activities were based on the value of living within the limits of available [[Renewable resource|renewable resources]] without [[environmental degradation]]. Over the next few decades an eclectic group of students, professors and experts from around the world and crossing many disciplines developed designs for an institute to be built at [[Cal Poly Pomona]]. In 1992 the [[Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies]] was built over two years and opened in 1994. In that same year Lyle's book ''Regenerative Design for Sustainable Development'' was published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]]. In 1995 Lyle worked with [[William McDonough]] at [[Oberlin College]] for the [[Adam Joseph Lewis Center for Environmental Studies]] completed in 2000. In 2002 McDonough's book, the more popular and successful, ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]'' was published reiterating the concepts developed by Lyle.

Lyle saw the connection between concepts developed by [[Robert Rodale|Bob Rodale]] of the [[Rodale Institute]] for [[regenerative agriculture]] and the opportunity to develop regenerative systems for all other aspects of the world. While regenerative agriculture focused solely on agriculture, Lyle expanded its concepts and use to all systems. With regenerative agriculture, the concepts are very straight forward and simple but Lyle understood that when developing for other types of systems, more complicated ideas such as [[entropy]] and [[embodied energy|emergy]] must be taken into consideration.

Swiss architect [[Walter R. Stahel]] developed approaches entirely similar to Lyle's also in the late 1970s but instead coined the term [[cradle-to-cradle design]] made popular by McDonough and [[Michael Braungart]]

Whilst in 1974 [[David Holmgren]] and [[Bill Mollison]] first started working together to develop the theory and practice of [[permaculture]]. They met when Mollison spoke at a seminar at the Department of Environmental Design and began to work together. During their first three years together Mollison worked at applying their ideas, and Holmgren wrote the manuscript for what would become ''Permaculture One: a perennial agricultural system for human settlements'' as he completed his Environmental Design studies, and submitted it as the major reference for his thesis. He then handed the manuscript to Mollison for editing and additions, before it was published in 1978. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dargavel|first=John|last2=Mulligan|first2=Martin|last3=Hill|first3=Stuart|date=July 2003|title=Ecological Pioneers: A Social History of Australian Ecological Thought and Action|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3986208|journal=Environmental History|volume=8|issue=3|pages=481|doi=10.2307/3986208|issn=1084-5453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term permaculture was developed and coined by [[David Holmgren]], then a graduate student at the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education's Department of Environmental Design, and [[Bill Mollison]], senior lecturer in Environmental Psychology at University of Tasmania, in 1978. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Permaculture One|last=Holmgren and Mollison|first=|publisher=Transworld Publishers|year=1978|isbn=0552980757|location=|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''permaculture'' originally referred to "permanent agriculture",{{Sfn|King|1911}}&lt;ref&gt;Paull , John (2011) [https://www.academia.edu/9148622/The_making_of_an_agricultural_classic_Farmers_of_Forty_Centuries_or_Permanent_Agriculture_in_China_Korea_and_Japan_1911-2011 The making of an agricultural classic: Farmers of Forty Centuries or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea and Japan, 1911-2011], Agricultural Sciences, 2 (3), pp. 175-180.&lt;/ref&gt; but was expanded to stand also for "permanent culture", as it was understood that social aspects were integral to a truly sustainable system as inspired by [[Masanobu Fukuoka]]’s [[natural farming]] philosophy. Regenerative design is integral to permaculture design.

== Regenerative versus sustainable ==
[[regeneration (ecology)|Regenerative]] and [[sustainable]] are essentially the same thing except for one key point: in a sustainable system, lost [[ecological system]]s are not returned to existence. In a regenerative system, those lost systems can ultimately begin "regenerating" back into existence. Put more simply regenerative systems work using regenerative feedback loops that allows for [[adaptability]], dynamism and [[emergence]] to create and develop resilient systems than the idea that we need to a sustain the world the way we (humans) found it, now and into the future.

There is also a linguistic problem with the word "sustainable", which in the strict sense is meant to mean "[[self-sustaining]]". Because the word root "sustain" means "last" or "endure," the general public and even many non-experts in the industry define the word only as "able to last" or "the capacity to endure." In popular usage by designers and product manufacturers, "sustainable" has become a relative term referring to any material, process or product (including a building) which is less toxic or environmental harmful than those conventionally used.  A product that contains 75% [[recycled]] material is often considered "sustainable", but is in fact merely MORE sustainable than a comparable product that contains no recycled material.  A truly sustainable material would be one made of 100% recycled material that can, in turn, be completely recycled into a comparable new material or product.  This is rarely the case.

"Regenerative" also suffers from a slightly different linguistic problem, the term is still competing with the biological community in terms of its use for the [[regeneration (biology)|re-growth]] of limbs etc.. However once the word itself gains wide usage, its meaning becomes more general, much like in the case of the term "sustainable". The base meaning of "re-generative" means the "capacity to bring into existence again." So if an item or system is regenerative the item or system has the capacity to bring itself into existence again. Using the example above, a truly regenerative product would not only be 100% recycled and recyclable, but it would also improve the environmental conditions at the factory where it was made, the business where it was used and so on throughout its life-cycle (creating habitat, filtering water, catalyzing [[nitrogen-fixation]] processes in the soil, etc.).

== Preservation versus conservation ==
Regenerative design places more importance on conservation and biodiversity rather than on preservation. It is recognized in regenerative design that humans are a part of natural ecosystems. To exclude people is to create dense areas that destroy pockets of existing ecosystems while preserving pockets of ecosystems without allowing them to change naturally over time. By incorporating people into ecosystems all inputs are pulled from local areas and all outputs are accounted for creating a waste-less system. 

== Food systems and business ==
Regenerative farming or '[[regenerative agriculture]]' calls for the creation of demand on agricultural systems to produce food in a way that is beneficial to the production and the ecology of the environment. It uses the [[science]] of [[systems ecology]], and the design and application through [[permaculture]]. As understanding of its benefits to human biology and ecological systems that sustain us is increased as has the demand for [[organic food]]. Organic food grown using regenerative and permaculture design increases the [[biodiversity]] and is used to develop business models that regenerate communities. Whereas some foods are organic some are not strictly regenerative because it is not clearly seeking to maximize biodiversity and the resilience of the environment and the workforce. Regenerative agriculture grows organic produce through [[Corporate social responsibility|ethical supply chains]], [[zero waste]] policies, [[Living wage|fair wages]], [[staff development]] and [[Wellbeing at Work conference|wellbeing]], and in some cases [[cooperative]] and [[social enterprise]] models. It seeks to benefit the staff along the [[supply chain]], customers, and ecosystems with the outcome of human and [[Restoration ecology|ecological restoration]] and regeneration.

== Size of regenerative systems ==
The size of the regenerative system effects the [[complexity]] of the design process. The smaller a [[system]] is designed the more likely it is to be resilient and regenerative. Multiple small regenerative systems that are put together to create larger regenerative systems help to create supplies for multiple human-inclusive-ecological systems.

{{Bertrand Russell}}

'''Russell's teapot''' is an [[analogy]], formulated by the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] (1872–1970), to illustrate that the [[philosophic burden of proof]] lies upon a person making [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]] claims, rather than shifting the burden of ''disproof'' to others.  

Russell specifically applied his analogy in the context of religion.&lt;ref&gt;Fritz Allhoff, Scott C. Lowe. ''The Philosophical Case Against Literal Truth: Russell's Teapot // Christmas - Philosophy for Everyone: Better Than a Lump of Coal''. — John Wiley and Sons, 2010. — Т. 5. — P. 65-66. — 256 p. — (Philosophy for Everyone). — {{ISBN|9781444330908}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that if he were to assert, without offering proof, that a [[teapot]], too small to be seen by telescopes, orbits the Sun somewhere in space between the Earth and Mars, he could not expect anyone to believe him solely because his assertion could not be proven wrong. 

Russell's teapot is still invoked in discussions concerning the [[existence of God]], and has had influence in various fields and media.

== Description ==
In an article titled "Is There a God?" commissioned, but never published, by ''Illustrated'' magazine in 1952, Russell wrote:

{{quote|Many orthodox people speak as though it were the business of sceptics to disprove received dogmas rather than of dogmatists to prove them. This is, of course, a mistake. If I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china teapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be able to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the teapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful telescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion cannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of human reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking nonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in ancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled into the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its existence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter to the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the Inquisitor in an earlier time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Is There a God? [1952]|editor-first=John G.|editor-last=Slater|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|authorlink=Bertrand Russell|title=The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell, Vol. 11: Last Philosophical Testament, 1943–68|year=1952|url=http://russell.mcmaster.ca/cpbr11p69.pdf|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=542–548|isbn=9780415094092}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

In 1958, Russell elaborated on the analogy:

{{quote|I ought to call myself an agnostic; but, for all practical purposes, I am an atheist. I do not think the existence of the Christian God any more probable than the existence of the [[Ancient Greek religion|Gods of Olympus]] or [[Norse religion|Valhalla]]. To take another illustration: nobody can prove that there is not between the Earth and Mars a china teapot revolving in an elliptical orbit, but nobody thinks this sufficiently likely to be taken into account in practice. I think the Christian God just as unlikely.&lt;ref name="garvey"&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Brian |last=Garvey |title=Absence of Evidence, Evidence of Absence, and the Atheist's Teapot |journal=[[Ars Disputandi]] |year=2010 |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=9–22 |doi=10.1080/15665399.2010.10820011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

== Analysis ==
Chemist [[Peter Atkins]] said that the point of Russell's teapot is that there is no burden on anyone to disprove assertions. [[Occam's razor]] suggests that the simpler theory with fewer assertions (e.g., a universe with no supernatural beings) should be the starting point in the discussion rather than the more complex theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science|editor=Clayton, Philip|editor2=Simpson, Zachary R.|first=Peter|last=Atkins|authorlink=Peter Atkins|contribution=Atheism and science|pages=129–130 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WhGyYy0SIoC|accessdate=2016-03-03|isbn=9780199279272|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, philosopher [[Paul Chamberlain]] says it is logically erroneous to assert that positive truth claims bear a burden of proof while negative truth claims do not.&lt;ref name="chamberlain"&gt;{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Chamberlain|title=Why People Don't Believe: Confronting Six Challenges to Christian Faith|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2AdNgqzawLAC&amp;pg=PA82 |year=2011|publisher=Baker Books|isbn=978-1-4412-3209-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; He says that all truth claims bear a burden of proof, and that like [[Mother Goose]] and the [[tooth fairy]], the teapot bears the greater burden not because of its negativity, but because of its triviality, arguing that "When we substitute normal, serious characters such as Plato, Nero, Winston Churchill, or George Washington in place of these fictional characters, it becomes clear that anyone denying the existence of these figures has a burden of proof equal to, or in some cases greater than, the person claiming they do exist."&lt;ref name="chamberlain"/&gt;

In his books ''[[A Devil's Chaplain]]'' (2003) and ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006), geneticist [[Richard Dawkins]] used the teapot as an analogy of an argument against what he termed "agnostic conciliation", a policy of intellectual appeasement that allows for philosophical domains that concern exclusively religious matters.&lt;ref name="devchap"&gt;{{cite book | title = A Devil's Chaplain: Reflections on Hope, Lies, Science, and Love | authorlink = Richard Dawkins | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | publisher = [[Houghton Mifflin]] | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-618-33540-4 | title-link = A Devil's Chaplain | chapter = The Great Convergence | pages = 146-151 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nBRYZtOuqZcC&amp;pg=PA146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Science has no way of establishing the existence or non-existence of a god. Therefore, according to the agnostic conciliator, because it is a matter of individual taste, belief and disbelief in a supreme being are deserving of equal respect and attention. Dawkins presents the teapot as a ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'' of this position: if agnosticism demands giving equal respect to the belief and disbelief in a supreme being, then it must also give equal respect to belief in an orbiting teapot, since the existence of an orbiting teapot is just as plausible scientifically as the existence of a supreme being.&lt;ref name = "goddel"&gt;{{cite book | title = The God Delusion | first = Richard | last = Dawkins | authorlink = Richard Dawkins | publisher = [[Random House]] | year = 2016 | edition = 10th Anniversary | isbn = 9781784161934 | title-link = The God Delusion | chapter = The Poverty of Agnosticism | pages = 69-77 | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=emE7DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher Brian Garvey argues that the teapot analogy fails with regard to religion because, with the teapot, the believer and non-believer are simply disagreeing about one item in the universe and may hold in common all other beliefs about the universe, which is not true of an atheist and a theist.&lt;ref name="garvey"/&gt; Garvey argues that it is not a matter of the theist propounding existence of a thing and the atheist simply denying it – each is asserting an alternative explanation of why the cosmos exists and is the way it is: "the atheist is not just denying an existence that the theist affirms – the atheist is in addition committed to the view that the universe is not the way it is because of God. It is either the way it is because of something other than God, or there is no reason it is the way it is."&lt;ref name="garvey"/&gt;

Philosopher [[Peter van Inwagen]] argues that while Russell's teapot is a fine piece of rhetoric, its logical argument form is less than clear, and attempting to make it clear reveals that the Teapot Argument is very far from cogent.&lt;ref name = "Epistemology"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Right to Believe: Perspectives in Religious Epistemology | editor1-first = Dariusz | editor1-last = Łukasiewicz | editor2-first = Roger | editor2-last = Pouivet | first = Peter | last = van Inwagen | authorlink = Peter van Inwagen | chapter = Russell's China Teapot | pages = 11-26 | publisher = [[Ontos Verlag]] | location = Frankfurt | year = 2012 | isbn = 9783110320169 | url = https://books.google.com.au/books?id=bmyK32rqKf0C&amp;pg=PA11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another philosopher, [[Alvin Plantinga]] states that a falsehood lies at the heart of Russell's argument. Russell's argument assumes that there is no evidence against the teapot, but Plantinga disagrees:

{{quote|Clearly we have a great deal of evidence against teapotism. For example, as far as we know, the only way a teapot could have gotten into orbit around the sun would be if some country with sufficiently developed space-shot capabilities had shot this pot into orbit. No country with such capabilities is sufficiently frivolous to waste its resources by trying to send a teapot into orbit. Furthermore, if some country had done so, it would have been all over the news; we would certainly have heard about it. But we haven't. And so on. There is plenty of evidence against teapotism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Gutting|first = Gary|authorlink = Gary Gutting|date = February 9, 2014|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|url = http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/is-atheism-irrational/|title = Is Atheism Irrational?|accessdate = July 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Philosopher [[Gary Gutting]] rejects Russell's teapot for similar reasons, arguing that Russell's argument accords theism far less support than it actually has. Gutting points out that numerous sensible, competent people appeal to personal experience and arguments in support of God's existence. Thus, to simply reject the existence of God, out of hand, seems unjustified, according to Gutting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/on-dawkinss-atheism-a-response|date = August 11, 2010|accessdate = November 27, 2018|newspaper = [[The New York Times]]|title = On Dawkins's Atheism: A Response|first = Gary|last = Gutting|authorlink = Gary Gutting}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary critic [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]], without believing in God, says that belief in God "is a good deal more reasonable than belief in a teapot" because God is a "grand and big idea" which "is not analogically disproved by reference to celestial teapots or vacuum cleaners, which lack the necessary bigness and grandeur" and "because God cannot be [[Reification (fallacy)|reified]], cannot be turned into a mere thing".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=James|last=Wood|authorlink=James Wood (critic)|title=The Celestial Teapot|journal=[[The New Republic]]|date=18 December 2006|issue=27|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/the-celestial-teapot|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One counter-argument, advanced by philosopher Eric Reitan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first = Eric |last=Reitan |title=Contributors |publisher=Religion Dispatches |url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/contributors/ericreitan/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that belief in God is different from belief in a teapot because teapots are physical and therefore in principle verifiable, and that given what we know about the physical world we have no good reason to think that belief in Russell's teapot is justified and at least some reason to think it not.&lt;ref name=Reitan&gt;{{cite book | title = Is God a Delusion? |first = Eric |last=Reitan|publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | date = 2008 | media_type = | pages = 78–80 | isbn = 978-1-4051-8361-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Similar analogies ==
Other thinkers have posited non-disprovable analogies, such as [[J. B. Bury]] in his 1913 book, ''History of Freedom of Thought'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some people speak as if we were not justified in rejecting a theological doctrine unless we can prove it false. But the burden of proof does not lie upon the rejecter.... If you were told that in a certain planet revolving around Sirius there is a race of donkeys who speak the English language and spend their time in discussing eugenics, you could not disprove the statement, but would it, on that account, have any claim to be believed? Some minds would be prepared to accept it, if it were reiterated often enough, through the potent force of suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= History of Freedom of Thought|edition= Illustrated Edition, published 2014 by [[Lulu Press, Inc.]]|isbn= 9781304988607 |last= Bury|first= John Bagnall|authorlink= J.

[[Astronomer]] [[Carl Sagan]] in his 1995 book ''[[The Demon-Haunted World]]'' offered a similar non-disprovable analogy called the Dragon in the Garage as an example of skeptical thinking. If Sagan claimed there was a dragon in his garage, you would wish to verify it for yourself but if Sagan's dragon was impossible to detect:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, what's the difference between an invisible, incorporeal, floating dragon who spits heatless fire and no dragon at all? If there's no way to disprove my contention, no conceivable experiment that would count against it, what does it mean to say that my dragon exists?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sagan|first1=Carl|authorlink=Carl Sagan|title=The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark|date=1995|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=9780394535128|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ybvaAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=editions:r7NWYii6Wt0C|accessdate=23 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Influence in religious parodies ==
The concept of Russell's teapot has influenced more explicitly [[Parody religion|religion-parodying]] concepts such as the [[Invisible Pink Unicorn]]&lt;ref name = "goddel"/&gt; and the [[Flying Spaghetti Monster]].&lt;ref name="Wolf2006"&gt;{{cite news | title=The Church of the Non-Believers | first=Gary | last=Wolf | date=14 November 2006 | publisher=[[Wired News]] | url=https://www.wired.com/2006/11/atheism/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1960s musician and psychedelic poet [[Daevid Allen]] of the band [[Gong (band)|Gong]] employed the image of a flying teapot in his [[Gong (band)#Mythology|Planet Gong Universe]] and the ''[[Flying Teapot (album)|Flying Teapot]]'' album trilogy, and refers to Russell's teapot in his book ''Gong Dreaming 2: The Histories &amp; Mysteries of Gong from 1969-1975''.{{cn|date=May 2017}}

The '''SAE Institute''' ('''SAE''', formerly also known as the '''School of Audio Engineering''' and the '''SAE Technology College''') is a private college founded in 1976 by [[sound engineer]], record producer and businessman Tom Misner. The first school was opened 1977 in Sydney.

SAE Institute offers courses in [[audio engineering]], 3D animation, [[multimedia]], [[graphic design]], [[game design]], digital filmmaking, and music production. It currently has campuses and facilities, including licensed [[franchising|franchise]] operations, in 54 cities in 30 countries.

==History==
SAE was established by Tom Misner in 1976 in Sydney, converting a small advertising studio into a classroom. Over the next six years, campuses in [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] were established. In the mid-1980s, SAE began opening colleges outside of Australia, including locations in London, [[Munich]], Frankfurt, [[Vienna]], Berlin, [[Auckland]], and [[Glasgow]]. In the 1990s, SAE opened a European head office in [[Amsterdam]], and locations were opened in Paris, Hamburg, [[Zürich]], [[Hobart]], [[Cologne]], Stockholm, and [[Milan]]. SAE also began expanding into Asia in the 1990s, opening locations in Singapore and [[Kuala Lumpur]]. In the late 1990s, SAE formed the SAE Entertainment Company and launched full university degree programs with the co-operation of [[Southern Cross University]] and [[Middlesex University]]. In 1999, SAE began opening facilities in the United States, and over the following decade opened locations in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Miami, San Francisco, [[Atlanta]], Los Angeles, and Chicago. In 2000, SAE began licensing [[Franchising|franchise]] schools in [[India]], opening four that year. In 2000s, locations were opened in [[Liverpool]], Madrid, [[Brussels]], [[Bangkok]], Leipzig, [[Barcelona]], [[Dubai]], [[Amman]], [[Cape Town]], [[Istanbul]], and [[Serbia]]. Licence agreements were signed for new schools in Qatar, Bogotá Colombia , Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Egypt. In the 2000s SAE also acquired QANTM, an Australian production, media and training company, and relocated its head office to [[Littlemore]] Park, [[Oxford]] and its headquarters to [[Byron Bay]], Australia.

In 2010, the SAE Institute was sold to Navitas, a publicly traded educational services company. Over the next few years, new locations were opened in [[Romania]], [[Jakarta]], and [[Moskhato]]. Navitas began taking over the licensed branches in the US in 2011, and laid off over 40 US employees in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;SAE Employee Discussion Thread, TheLayoff.com [http://www.thelayoff.com/SAE-institute "SAE Institute Layoffs"], TheLayoff.com.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5680">'''Sensory-specific satiety''' is a sensory hedonic phenomenon that refers to the declining satisfaction generated by the [[Ingestion|consumption]] of a certain type of food, and the consequent renewal in [[appetite]] resulting from the exposure to a new [[flavor]] or food.&lt;ref name="Raynor 2001"&gt;Raynor H, Epstein L. Dietary Variety, Energy Regulation, and Obesity. ''Psychological Bulletin'' 2001; 127: 325-341. [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:7V8EY5kQslwJ:91.197.230.154/files/DietaryVarietyEnergyRegulationAndObesity.pdf+Raynor,+H.+and+L.+Epstein.+2001.+Dietary+Variety,+Energy+Regulation,+and+Obesity.+Psychological+Bulletin+127:+(325-341).+University+of+Buffalo.&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESh63uHvNhtKNMFuT4yd3UKbOjLykqjyGX79u5jCcrfY1uPkKsfUoXzBgOy5CuGb-KSdjlQJKaU04PIg3lLC71IYsVyM9DR_4IR6zVDSdCt_jvtkL1KTlH8YTxoYiVb2-ck_TBP6&amp;sig=AHIEtbRx1eUEeeJSiTnD9T6KgSL-BGKoBg full text]&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon was first described in 1956&lt;ref&gt;Le Magnen J. Hyperphagie provoquée chez le Rat blanc par altération du mécanisme de satiété périphérique. ''Comptes Rendus des Séances de la Société de Biologie (Paris)'' 1956; 150(1): 32–35.&lt;/ref&gt; by the French physiologist [[Jacques Le Magnen]]. The term has been coined in 1981&lt;ref&gt;Rolls BJ, Rolls ET, Rowe EA, Sweeney K. Sensory specific satiety in man. ''Physiol Behav.'' 1981;27(1):137-42.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Barbara J. Rolls]] and [[Edmund T. Rolls]]. Its concept illustrates the role of physical stimuli in generating appetite and, more specifically, explains the significance of [[taste]] in relation to [[Hunger (motivational state)|hunger]].&lt;ref&gt;Gray P. 2007. Psychology. Fifth Edition. Worth Publishers. [http://www.worthpublishers.com/gray6epreview/ table of contents]&lt;/ref&gt; Besides [[conditioned satiety]] and [[alliesthesia|alimentary alliesthesia]], it is one of the three major phenomena of satiation.

[[File:Chinese buffet2.jpg|thumb|Diners at a buffet eat a larger quantity of food than those eating a single dish]]
This process is most commonly illustrated by a standard [[buffet]]. People are more likely to eat a larger amount of food at a buffet because the variety of foods and [[flavor]]s presented renews a sense of appetite in the individual. A study conducted by Rolls and van Duijvenvoorde in 1984 verified this process by simulating a buffet-style meal. They fed participants four meals that included sausages, bread and butter, chocolate dessert, and bananas. They then fed the participants four courses of one of these foods. The results revealed a 44% increase in overall food consumption when exposed to the meals with a variety of foods.&lt;ref name="Raynor 2001"/&gt;

Postingestive feedback factors such as [[energy density]] and [[nutrient density|nutrient composition]] could affect the [[palatability]] of a food which in turn would inhibit or facilitate ''sensory-specific satiety''. Studies done by Birch &amp; Deysher (1986) and B.J. Rolls ''et al.'', summarized in a paper by Raynor and Epstein, show that postingesitive feedback does not influence ''sensory-specific satiety'' very much. Since postingestive feedback seems to have little effect of sensory-specific satiety, it is probable that sensory-specific satiety is more driven by external factors, such as the sensory properties of the food, than internal factors.&lt;ref name="Raynor 2001"/&gt;

== Obesity in relation to sensory-specific satiety ==

Studies have shown that eating monotonous meals (limited variety in food) results in long-term sensory-specific satiety.&lt;ref&gt;* Raynor HA, Niemeier HM, Wing RR. Effect of limiting snack food variety on long-term sensory-specific satiety and monotony during obesity treatment. ''Eating Behaviors'' 2006; 7(1):1-14. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eatbeh.2005.05.005 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; By continuing to eat similar meals, a [[Dieting|dieter]] can reduce their overall [[food intake]] and use sensory-specific satiety as a tool for [[weight loss]]. On the contrary, sensory-specific satiety can also cause [[obesity]] because of the stimulation of hunger for foods of different variety.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} The higher energy content the food has, the less likely sensory-specific satiety will become activated.&lt;ref&gt;Rolls BJ, Van Duijvenvoorde PM, Rowe EA. Variety in the diet enhances intake in a meal and contributes to the development of obesity in the rat. ''Physiology &amp; Behavior'' 1983; 31(1):21-7. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0031-9384(83)90091-4 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Age in relation to sensory-specific satiety ==

Sensory-specific satiety varies depending on age, with the elderly experiencing  decreased sensory-specific satiety and adolescents experiencing more.&lt;ref name="Rolls 1991"&gt;Rolls BJ, McDermott TM. Effect of age on sensory-specific satiety. ''Am J Clin Nutr'' 1991; 54(6): 988-996. [http://www.ajcn.org/content/54/6/988.short abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; In a study focusing on age in sensory-specific satiety, it was hypothesized that the degree of sensory-specific satiety is affected by age due to the slow sensory loss that accompanies elderly people.&lt;ref name="Rolls 1991"/&gt; By hypothesis, due to the [[Sensory deprivation|sensory impairment]], a natural, more monotonous diet would occur just due to lack of pleasantness from variety of foods. However, it was proven that sensory impairment did not greatly affect the decline in sensory-specific satiety; instead, there is an unclear [[cognitive]] process that relates to decline in sensory-specific satiety that just may be the decreased desire for overall change in the elderly as compared to adolescents.&lt;ref name="Rolls 1991"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5719">In [[geometry]], '''space partitioning''' is the process of dividing a [[space]] (usually a [[Euclidean space]]) into two or more [[Disjoint sets|disjoint]] [[subset]]s  (see also [[partition of a set]]).  In other words, space partitioning divides a space into non-overlapping regions.  Any point in the space can then be identified to lie in exactly one of the regions.

== Overview ==
Space-partitioning systems are often [[hierarchy|hierarchical]], meaning that a space (or a region of space) is divided into several regions, and then the same space-partitioning system is [[recursion|recursively]] applied to each of the regions thus created.  The regions can be organized into a [[Tree data structure|tree]], called a '''space-partitioning tree'''.

Most space-partitioning systems use [[plane (mathematics)|plane]]s (or, in higher dimensions, [[hyperplane]]s) to divide space: points on one side of the plane form one region, and points on the other side form another.  Points exactly on the plane are usually arbitrarily assigned to one or the other side.  Recursively partitioning space using planes in this way produces a [[BSP tree]], one of the most common forms of space partitioning.

== Uses ==
=== In computer graphics ===
Space partitioning is particularly important in [[computer graphics]], especially  heavily used in [[ray tracing (graphics)|ray tracing]], where it is frequently used to organize the objects in a virtual scene. A typical scene may contain millions of polygons. Performing a ray/polygon [[intersection test]] with each would be a very computationally expensive task. 

Storing objects in a space-partitioning [[data structure]] ([[k-d tree|''k''-d tree]] or [[BSP tree]] for example) makes it easy and fast to perform certain kinds of geometry queries—for example in determining whether a ray intersects an object, space partitioning can reduce the number of intersection test to just a few per primary ray, yielding a logarithmic [[time complexity]] with respect to the number of polygons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://dip.felk.cvut.cz/browse/pdfcache/nikodtom_2010bach.pdf | title = Ray Tracing Algorithm For Interactive Applications | author = Tomas Nikodym | journal = Czech Technical University, FEE | year = 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | citeseerx = 10.1.1.108.8495 | title = State of the Art in Ray Tracing Animated Scenes | author = Ingo Wald, William R. Mark| journal = EUROGRAPHICS | year = 2007|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://undergraduate.csse.uwa.edu.au/units/CITS4241/Handouts/Lecture14.html Ray Tracing - Auxiliary Data Structures]&lt;/ref&gt;

Space partitioning is also often used in scanline algorithms to eliminate the polygons out of the camera's [[viewing frustum]], limiting the number of polygons processed by the pipeline. There is also a usage in [[collision detection]]: determining whether two objects are close to each other can be much faster using space partitioning.

=== In integrated circuit design ===
In [[integrated circuit design]], an important step is [[design rule check]]. This step ensures that the completed design is manufacturable. The check involves rules that specify widths and spacings and other geometry patterns. A modern design can have billions of polygons that represent wires and transistors. Efficient checking relies heavily on geometry query. For example, a rule may specify that any polygon must be at least ''n'' nanometers from any other polygon. This is converted into a geometry query by enlarging a polygon by ''n/2'' at all sides and query to find all intersecting polygons.

=== In probability and statistical learning theory ===
The number of components in a space partition plays a central role in some results in probability theory. See [[Growth function]] for more details.

==Data structures==
Common space-partitioning systems include:
* [[BSP tree]]s;
* [[Quadtree]]s;
* [[Octree]]s;
* [[k-d tree|''k''-d tree]]s;
* [[Bin (computational geometry)|Bins]];
* [[R-tree]]s;
* [[Bounding volume hierarchies]].

==Number of components==
Suppose the n-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] is partitioned by &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; [[hyperplane]]s that are &lt;math&gt;(n-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional. What is the number of components in the partition? The largest number of components is attained when the hyperplanes are in [[general position]], i.e, no two are parallel and no three have the same intersection. Denote this maximum number of components by &lt;math&gt;Comp(n,r)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, the following recurrence relation holds:

::&lt;math&gt;Comp(n,r) = Comp(n, r-1) + Comp(n-1,r-1)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;Comp(0,r) = 1&lt;/math&gt; - when there are no dimensions, there is a single point.
::&lt;math&gt;Comp(n,0) = 1&lt;/math&gt; - when there are no hyperplanes, all the space is a single component.
And its solution is:
::&lt;math&gt;Comp(n,r) = \sum_{k=0}^n {r\choose k}&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;r\geq n&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;Comp(n,r) = 2^r&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;r\leq n&lt;/math&gt;
::::(consider e.g. &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; perpendicular hyperplanes; each additional hyperplane divides each existing component to 2).
which is upper-bounded as:
::&lt;math&gt;Comp(n,r) \leq r^n+1&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5385">[[File:Mad Dog spar.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Mad Dog Spar Platform]]
A '''spar''' is a type of floating [[oil platform]] typically used in very deep waters, and is named for [[Spar buoy|logs used as buoys]] in shipping that are moored in place vertically.  Spar production platforms have been developed as an alternative to conventional platforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/FMC/3096681466x0x34671/EB7DD315-B0B2-4B24-8907-99526181726A/AR2005.pdf www.fmctechnologies.com "Annual Report - Glossary of Terms"]&lt;/ref&gt; The deep draft design of spars makes them less affected by wind, wave and currents and allows for both dry tree and subsea production. Spars are most prevalent in the US Gulf of Mexico; however, there are also spars located offshore Malaysia and Norway.&lt;ref name="Offshore mag deepwater"&gt;[http://www.offshore-mag.com/content/dam/offshore/print-articles/volume-74/05/1405offdeepwaterposter.pdf Offshore Magazine "2014 DEEPWATER SOLUTIONS &amp; RECORDS FOR CONCEPT SELECTION"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A spar platform consists of a large-diameter, single vertical [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]] supporting a deck. The cylinder is weighted at the bottom by a chamber filled with a material that is denser than water (to lower the center of gravity of the platform and provide stability).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?insight_id=307&amp;c_id=12 Rigzone "How Do Spars Work?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the spar hull is encircled by helical strakes to mitigate the effects of vortex-induced motion. Spars are permanently anchored to the seabed by way of a spread mooring system composed of either a chain-wire-chain or chain-polyester-chain configuration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.offshore-mag.com/articles/print/volume-62/issue-10/news/state-of-the-art-of-spread-moored-systems-for-deepwater-floating-production-platforms.html Offshore Magazine "State-of-the-art of spread moored systems for deepwater floating production platforms"]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three primary types of spars; the classic spar, truss spar, and cell spar.  The classic spar consists of the cylindrical hull noted above, with heavy ballast tanks located at the bottom of the cylinder.

A truss spar has a shorter cylindrical "hard tank" than a classic spar and has a [[truss]] structure connected to the bottom of the hard tank.  This truss structure consists of four large [[orthogonal]] "leg" members with X-braces between each of the legs and heave plates at intermediate depths to provide damping. At the bottom of the truss structure, there is a relatively small keel, or soft tank, that houses the heavy ballasting material.  Soft tanks are typically rectangular in shape but have also been round to accommodate specific construction concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ogj.com/articles/print/volume-103/issue-38/special-report/new-spar-installed-in-gulf.html Oil and Gas Journal "New spar installed in gulf"]&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of spars are of this type.&lt;ref name="Offshore mag deepwater" /&gt;

A third type of spar, the cell spar, has a large central cylinder surrounded by smaller cylinders of alternating lengths.  At the bottom of the longer cylinders is the soft tank housing the heavy ballasting material, similar to a truss spar.  The cell spar design was only ever used for one platform, the Red Hawk spar,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.offshore-mag.com/articles/print/volume-64/issue-4/construction-installation/cell-spar-enables-red-hawk-development.html "Cell spar enables Red Hawk development"]&lt;/ref&gt; which was decommissioned in 2014 under the [[Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement]]'s "[[Rigs-to-Reefs]]" program.  At the time of its decommissioning it was the deepest floating platform to ever be decommissioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oedigital.com/component/k2/item/7339-deepest-gom-decommissioning-job-complete "Deepest GoM decom job complete"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first spar was the [[Brent Spar]], a platform designed for storage and offloading of crude oil products. It was installed in the Brent Field in June 1976. The attempted deep sea disposal of the platform in the 1990s created a huge backlash by Greenpeace. The spar was eventually dismantled and pieces were used as a foundation for a [[quay]] in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-static.shell.com/static/gbr/downloads/e_and_p/brent_spar_dossier.pdf Brent Spar Dossier], Shell&lt;/ref&gt;

The first spar designed for production was the Neptune spar, located in the [[Gulf of Mexico]], and was installed in September 1996 by [[Kerr McGee]] (now [[Anadarko Petroleum Corporation|Anadarko]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalgas.org/naturalgas/extraction_offshore.asp www.naturalgas.org "Spar Platforms"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218002227/http://www.naturalgas.org/naturalgas/extraction_offshore.asp |date=2008-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's deepest production platform is [[Perdido (Oil platform)|Perdido]], a truss spar in the Gulf of Mexico, with a mean water depth of 2,438 meters. It is operated by [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and was built at a cost of $3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN3123683920100331 Shell starts production at Perdido]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stellar drift''', or the motion of stars, is a necessary result of the [[Special relativity#Lack of an absolute reference frame|lack of an absolute reference frame]] in special relativity.

Nothing in space stands still—more precisely, standing still is meaningless without defining what "still" means. Most [[galaxy|galaxies]] have been moving away ever since the [[Big Bang]], as explained by the [[metric expansion of space]]. Galaxy motion is also influenced by [[galaxy groups and clusters]]. Stars orbit moving galaxies, and they also orbit moving [[star cluster]]s and [[binary star|companion star]]s. Planets orbit their moving stars.

Stellar drift is measured by two components: [[proper motion]] (multiplied by distance) and [[radial velocity]]. Proper motion is a star's motion across the sky, slowly changing the shapes of [[constellation]]s over thousands of years. It can be measured using a telescope to detect small movements over long periods of time. Radial velocity is how fast a star approaches or recedes from us. It is measured using [[redshift]]. Both components are complicated by the Earth's orbit around the Sun, so the motions of stars are described relative to the Sun, not the Earth ([[Star#Kinematics|kinematics of stars]]).

'''Swallowing''', sometimes called '''deglutition''' in scientific contexts, is the process in the human or animal body that allows for a substance to pass from the [[mouth]], to the [[pharynx]], and into the [[esophagus]], while shutting the [[epiglottis]]. Swallowing is an important part of [[eating]] and [[drinking]]. If the process fails and the material (such as food, drink, or medicine) goes through the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]], then [[choking]] or [[pulmonary aspiration]] can occur. In the human body the automatic temporary closing of the epiglottis is controlled by the swallowing [[reflex]].

The portion of food, drink, or other material that will move through the [[neck]] in one swallow is called a '''bolus'''.

==In humans==

===Coordination and control===
Eating and swallowing are complex neuromuscular activities consisting essentially of three phases, an oral, pharyngeal and esophageal phase. Each phase is controlled by a different neurological mechanism. The oral phase, which is entirely voluntary, is mainly controlled by the [[medial (anatomy)|medial]] [[temporal lobe]]s and [[limbic system]] of the [[cerebral cortex]] with contributions from the motor cortex and other cortical areas. The pharyngeal swallow is started by the oral phase and subsequently is coordinated by the swallowing center on the [[medulla oblongata]] and [[pons]]. The reflex is initiated by touch receptors in the [[pharynx]] as a [[Bolus (digestion)|bolus]] of food is pushed to the back of the mouth by the tongue, or by stimulation of the palate (palatal reflex).

Swallowing is a complex mechanism using both skeletal muscle ([[tongue]]) and smooth muscles of the pharynx and [[esophagus]]&lt;!-- Please do not change the spelling of esophagus to oesophagus --&gt;. The [[autonomic nervous system]] (ANS) coordinates this process in the pharyngeal and esophageal phases.

[[File:Real-time MRI - Swallowing (Pineapple Juice).ogv|thumb|[[Real-time MRI]] – swallowing]]
[[File:Sagittalmouth.png|thumb|right|Sagittal view of mouth and pharynx]]

===Phases===

====Oral phase====
Prior to the following stages of the oral phase, the mandible depresses and the lips abduct to allow food or liquid to enter the oral cavity.  Upon entering the oral cavity, the mandible elevates and the lips adduct to assist in oral containment of the food and liquid.  The following stages describe the normal and necessary actions to form the bolus, which is defined as the state of the food in which it is ready to be swallowed.

1) '''Moistening'''

Food is moistened by saliva from the [[salivary glands]] ([[parasympathetic]]).

2) '''Mastication'''

Food is mechanically broken down by the action of the teeth controlled by the muscles of mastication (V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) acting on the [[temporomandibular joint]]. This results in a bolus which is moved from one side of the oral cavity to the other by the tongue. [[buccinator muscle|Buccinator]] (VII) helps to contain the food against the occlusal surfaces of the teeth. The bolus is ready for swallowing when it is held together by (largely mucus) saliva (VII—chorda tympani and IX—lesser petrosal), sensed by the [[lingual nerve]] of the tongue (V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Any food that is too dry to form a bolus will not be swallowed.

3) '''Trough formation'''

A trough is then formed at the back of the tongue by the intrinsic muscles (XII). The trough obliterates against the hard palate from front to back, forcing the bolus to the back of the tongue.
The intrinsic muscles of the tongue (XII) contract to make a trough (a longitudinal concave fold) at the back of the tongue. The tongue is then elevated to the roof of the mouth (by the [[Mylohyoid nerve|mylohyoid]] (mylohyoid nerve—V&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[genioglossus]], [[styloglossus]] and [[hyoglossus]] (the rest XII)) such that the tongue slopes downwards posteriorly. The contraction of the [[genioglossus]] and [[styloglossus]] (both XII) also contributes to the formation of the central trough.

4) '''Movement of the bolus posteriorly'''

At the end of the oral preparatory phase, the food bolus has been formed and is ready to be propelled posteriorly into the pharynx.  In order for anterior to posterior transit of the bolus to occur, orbicularis oris contracts and adducts the lips to form a tight seal of the oral cavity.  Next, the superior longitudinal muscle elevates the apex of the tongue to make contact with the hard palate and the bolus is propelled to the posterior portion of the oral cavity.  Once the bolus reaches the [[palatoglossal arch]] of the oropharynx, the pharyngeal phase, which is reflex and involuntary, then begins. Receptors initiating this reflex are proprioceptive (afferent limb of reflex is IX and efferent limb is the pharyngeal plexus- IX and X). They are scattered over the base of the tongue, the palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches, the tonsillar fossa, uvula and posterior pharyngeal wall. Stimuli from the receptors of this phase then provoke the pharyngeal phase. In fact, it has been shown that the swallowing reflex can be initiated entirely by peripheral stimulation of the internal branch of the [[superior laryngeal nerve]]. This phase is ''voluntary'' and involves important [[cranial nerves]]: [[trigeminal nerve|V (trigeminal)]], [[facial nerve|VII (facial)]] and [[hypoglossal nerve|XII (hypoglossal)]].

====Pharyngeal phase====

For the pharyngeal phase to work properly all other egress from the pharynx must be occluded—this includes the [[nasopharynx]] and the [[larynx]]. When the pharyngeal phase begins, other activities such as chewing, breathing, coughing and vomiting are concomitantly inhibited.

5) '''Closure of the nasopharynx'''

The soft palate is tensed by [[tensor palati]]ni (Vc), and then elevated by [[levator palati]]ni (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X) to close the nasopharynx. There is also the simultaneous approximation of the walls of the pharynx to the posterior free border of the soft palate, which is carried out by the palatopharyngeus (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X) and the upper part of the superior constrictor (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X).

6) '''The pharynx prepares to receive the bolus'''

The pharynx is pulled upwards and forwards by the [[suprahyoid]] and longitudinal pharyngeal muscles – [[stylopharyngeus]] (IX), [[salpingopharyngeus]] (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X) and [[palatopharyngeus]] (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X) to receive the bolus.  The palatopharyngeal folds on each side of the pharynx are brought close together through the superior constrictor muscles, so that only  a small bolus can pass.

7) '''Opening of the [[auditory tube]]'''

The actions of the [[levator palati]]ni (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X), [[tensor palati]]ni (Vc) and [[salpingopharyngeus]] (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X) in the closure of the nasopharynx and elevation of the pharynx opens the auditory tube, which equalises the pressure between the nasopharynx and the middle ear. This does not contribute to swallowing, but happens as a consequence of it.

8) '''Closure of the [[oropharynx]]'''

The oropharynx is kept closed by palatoglossus (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X), the intrinsic muscles of tongue (XII) and styloglossus (XII).

9) '''Laryngeal closure'''

It is true vocal fold closure that is the primary laryngopharyngeal protective mechanism to prevent aspiration during swallowing. The adduction of the vocal cords is effected by the contraction of the [[lateral cricoarytenoids]] and the oblique and transverse [[arytenoids]] (all recurrent laryngeal nerve of vagus). Since the true vocal folds adduct during the swallow, a finite period of apnea (swallowing apnea) must necessarily take place with each swallow. When relating swallowing to respiration, it has been demonstrated that swallowing occurs most often during expiration, even at full expiration a fine air jet is expired probably to clear the upper larynx from food remnants or liquid. The clinical significance of this finding is that patients with a baseline of compromised lung function will, over a period of time, develop respiratory distress as a meal progresses.
Subsequently, false vocal fold adduction, adduction of the aryepiglottic folds and retroversion of the epiglottis take place. The aryepiglotticus (recurrent laryngeal nerve of vagus) contracts, causing the arytenoids to appose each other (closes the laryngeal aditus by bringing the aryepiglottic folds together), and draws the epiglottis down to bring its lower half into contact with arytenoids, thus closing the aditus. Retroversion of the epiglottis, while not the primary mechanism of protecting the airway from laryngeal penetration and aspiration, acts to anatomically direct the food bolus laterally towards the [[piriform fossa]].
Additionally, the larynx is pulled up with the pharynx under the tongue by stylopharyngeus (IX), salpingopharyngeus (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X), palatopharyngeus (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X) and inferior constrictor (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X).This phase is ''passively'' controlled reflexively and involves cranial nerves V, [[vagus nerve|X (vagus)]], [[accessory nerve|XI (accessory)]] and [[hypoglossal nerve|XII (hypoglossal)]].  The [[respiratory center of the medulla]] is directly inhibited by the swallowing center for the very brief time that it takes to swallow.  This means that it is briefly impossible to breathe during this phase of swallowing and the moment where breathing is prevented is known as ''deglutition [[apnea]]''.

10) '''[[Hyoid]] elevation'''

The hyoid is elevated by digastric (V &amp; VII) and stylohyoid (VII), lifting the pharynx and larynx up even further.

11) '''Bolus transits pharynx'''

The bolus moves down towards the esophagus by pharyngeal [[peristalsis]] which takes place by sequential contraction of the superior, middle and inferior pharyngeal constrictor muscles (pharyngeal plexus—IX, X). The lower part of the inferior constrictor ([[cricopharyngeus]]) is normally closed and only opens for the advancing bolus. Gravity plays only a small part in the upright position—in fact, it is possible to swallow solid food even when standing on one’s head. The velocity through the pharynx depends on a number of factors such as viscosity and volume of the bolus. In one study, bolus velocity in healthy adults was measured to be approximately 30–40&amp;nbsp;cm/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Clave |first1=P. |last2=De Kraa |first2=M. |last3=Arreola |first3=V. |last4=Girvent |first4=M. |last5=Farre |first5=R. |last6=Palomera |first6=E. |last7=Serra-Prat |first7=M. |year=2006 |title=The effect of bolus viscosity on swallowing function in neurogenic dysphagia |journal=Alimentary Pharmacology &amp; Therapeutics |volume=24 |issue=9 |pages=1385–1394 |publisher=Wiley |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2036.2006.03118.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Esophageal phase====

12) '''Esophageal peristalsis'''

Like the pharyngeal phase of swallowing, the esophageal phase of swallowing is under involuntary neuromuscular control. However, propagation of the food bolus is significantly slower than in the pharynx. The bolus enters the esophagus and is propelled downwards first by striated muscle (recurrent laryngeal, X) then by the smooth muscle (X) at a rate of 3–5&amp;nbsp;cm/s. The upper esophageal sphincter relaxes to let food pass, after which various striated constrictor muscles of the pharynx as well as peristalsis and relaxation of the [[Cardia|lower esophageal sphincter]] sequentially push the bolus of food through the esophagus into the stomach.

13) '''Relaxation phase'''

Finally the larynx and pharynx move down with the hyoid mostly by elastic recoil. Then the larynx and pharynx move down from the hyoid to their relaxed positions by elastic recoil.
Swallowing therefore depends on coordinated interplay between many various muscles, and although the initial part of swallowing is under [[voluntary control]], once the deglutition process is started, it is quite hard to stop it.

====Clinical significance====
Swallowing becomes a great concern for the elderly since [[stroke]]s and [[Alzheimer's disease]] can interfere with the [[autonomic nervous system]].  [[Speech Pathologists]] commonly diagnose and treat this condition since the speech process uses the same neuromuscular structures as swallowing. Diagnostic procedures commonly performed by a Speech Pathologist to evaluate dysphagia include Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing and Modified Barium Swallow Study. Occupational Therapists may also offer swallowing rehabilitation services as well as prescribing modified feeding techniques and utensils. Consultation with a dietician is essential, in order to ensure that the individual with dysphagia is able to consume sufficient calories and nutrients to maintain health. In terminally ill patients, a failure of the reflex to swallow leads to a build-up of mucus or saliva in the throat and airways, producing a noise known as a [[death rattle]] (not to be confused with [[agonal respiration]], which is an abnormal pattern of breathing due to cerebral ischemia or hypoxia).

Abnormalities of the pharynx and/or oral cavity may lead to [[oropharyngeal dysphagia]].  Abnormalities of the esophagus may lead to [[esophageal dysphagia]].
The failure of the lower esophagus sphincter to respond properly to swallowing is called [[achalasia]].

==In non-mammal animals==
[[File:Pelican swallowing a fish part 4.JPG|thumb|right|220px|[[Pelican]] swallowing a fish]]
In many birds, the esophagus is largely a mere [[Chute (gravity)|gravity chute]], and in such events as a [[seagull]] swallowing a fish or a [[stork]] swallowing a [[frog]], swallowing consists largely of the bird lifting its head with its beak pointing up and guiding the prey with tongue and jaws so that the prey slides inside and down.

In [[fish]], the tongue is largely bony and much less mobile and getting the food to the back of the pharynx is helped by pumping water in its mouth and out of its [[gill]]s.

In [[snake]]s, the work of swallowing is done by raking with the lower jaw until the prey is far enough back to be helped down by body undulations.

'''Symbiosis in lichens''' is the mutually helpful [[symbiotic relationship]] of [[green algae]] and/or blue-green algae ([[cyanobacteria]]) living among filaments of a [[fungus]], forming [[lichen]].&lt;ref name=LNA/&gt;&lt;ref name=WIL&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.anbg.gov.au/lichen/what-is-lichen.html |title=What is a lichen? |publisher=Australian National Botanical Garden}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCILABK&gt;{{cite web |title=Introduction to Lichens – an Alliance between Kingdoms |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/fungi/lichens/lichens.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Living as a [[Symbiosis|symbiont]] in a [[lichen]] appears to be a successful way for a fungus to derive essential nutrients, as about 20% of all fungal species have acquired this mode of life.&lt;ref name=UCLS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/fungi/lichens/lichensy.html |title=Lichens: Systematics |publisher=University of California Museum of Paleontology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[autotroph]]ic symbionts occurring in lichens are a wide variety of simple, photosynthetic organisms commonly and traditionally known as “algae”. These symbionts include both [[prokaryotic]] and [[eukaryotic]] organisms.&lt;ref name=dobson/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCLS/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCILABK/&gt;&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;

==Overview of lichens==
{{main|Lichen}}
::''"[[Lichen]]s are [[fungi]] that have discovered agriculture"'' &amp;mdash; Trevor Goward&lt;ref name=LNA&gt;{{cite web |title=Lichen biology and the environment |series=Lichens of North America |author1=Sylvia Sharnoff |author2=Stephen Sharnoff |url=http://www.lichen.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[lichen]] is a combination of fungus and/or algae and/or cyanobacteria has a very different form ([[morphology (biology)|morphology]]), [[physiology]], and [[biochemistry]] than any of the constituent species growing separately. The algae or cyanobacteria benefit their fungal partner by producing organic carbon compounds through [[photosynthesis]]. In return, the fungal partner benefits the algae or cyanobacteria by protecting them from the environment by its filaments, which also gather moisture and nutrients from the environment, and (usually) provide an anchor to it.&lt;ref name=dobson/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCLS/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCILABK/&gt;&lt;ref name=WIL/&gt;

The majority of the lichens contain eukaryotic autotrophs belonging to the [[Chlorophyta]] (green algae) or to the Xanthophyta ([[yellow-green algae]]). About 90% of all known lichens have a green alga as a symbiont. Among these, ''[[Trebouxia]]'' is the most common genus, occurring in about 20% of all lichens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/819628036 |title=Lichen Biology |date=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |others=Nash, Thomas H. |isbn=1281751391 |oclc=819628036}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second most commonly represented green alga genus is ''[[Trentepohlia (alga)|Trentepohlia]]''. Overall, about 100&amp;nbsp;species are known to occur as autotrophs in lichens. All the algae and cyanobacteria are believed to be able to survive separately, as well as within the lichen; that is, at present no algae or cyanobacteria are known which can only survive naturally as part of a lichen.&lt;ref name=Rikkinen1995/&gt; Common algal partners are ''[[Trebouxia]]'', ''[[Pseudotrebouxia]]'', or ''[[Myrmecia (alga)|Myrmecia]]''.&lt;ref name=dobson&gt;{{cite book |first=F.S. |last=Dobson |year=2000 |title=Lichens, an illustrated guide to the British and Irish species. |publisher=Richmond Publishing Co. Ltd. |location=Slough, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prokaryotes belong to the [[Cyanobacteria]], which are often called by their old name “''bluegreen algae''”. Bluegreen algae occur as symbionts only in about 8% of known lichens. The most commonly occurring genus of symbiotic [[cyanobacteria]] is ''[[Nostoc]]''.&lt;ref name=Rikkinen1995&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rikkinen J. |year=1995 |title=What's behind the pretty colors? A study on the photobiology of lichens |journal=Bryobrothera |volume=4 |pages=1–226}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Scytonema]]''.&lt;ref name=UCLS/&gt;

===Nomenclature===
Both the lichen and the fungus partner bear the same scientific name, and the lichens are being integrated into the classification schemes for fungi. Depending on context, the taxonomic name can be meant to refer to the entire lichen, or just the fungus that is part of the lichen.&lt;!-- Insert an example of when "lichenized fungus" refers to just the fungus is when the fungus is grown in culture without a phycobiont. --&gt;&lt;!-- Insert an example where "lichenized fungus" refers to the entire lichen is in a list of classified lichens. --&gt;

The alga or cyanobacterim bears its own scientific name, which bears no relationship to either the name of the lichen or the fungus.&lt;ref name="Kirk pp.378-81"/&gt;

==Fungus component==
About 20% of all fungal species are able to form lichens. The fungal partner may be an [[Ascomycete]] or [[Basidiomycete]].&lt;ref name=UCLS/&gt; Overall, about 98% of lichens have an ascomycetous mycobiont. Next to the Ascomycota, the largest number of lichenized fungi occur in the unassigned [[fungi imperfecti]]. Comparatively few [[Basidiomycetes]] are lichenized, but these include [[agarics]], such as species of ''[[Lichenomphalia]]'', [[clavarioid fungi]], such as species of ''[[Multiclavula]]'', and [[corticioid fungi]], such as species of ''[[Dictyonema]]''.

The largest number of lichenized fungi occur in the [[Ascomycota]], with about 40% of species forming such an association.&lt;ref name="Kirk pp.378-81"&gt;Kirk ''et al''., pp. 378–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these lichenized fungi occur in orders with nonlichenized fungi that live as [[saprotroph]]s or [[parasite|plant parasites]] (for example, the [[Leotiales]], [[Dothideales]], and [[Pezizales]]).

Other lichen fungi occur in only five [[order (biology)|orders]] in which all members are engaged in this habit (Orders [[Graphidales]], [[Gyalectales]], [[Peltigerales]], [[Pertusariales]], and [[Teloschistales]]). Lichenized and nonlichenized fungi can even be found in the same genus or species.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Photosynthetic component==
The photosynthetic component of a lichen is called the '''[[photobiont]]''' or '''[[phycobiont]]'''.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt;  The layer of tissue containing the cells of the photobiont is called the “photobiontic layer”.&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ/&gt;

Approximately 100&amp;nbsp;species of photosynthetic partners from 40&amp;nbsp;genera and 5&amp;nbsp;distinct classes (prokaryotic: [[Cyanophyceae]]; eukaryotic: [[Trebouxiophyceae]], [[Phaeophyceae]], [[Chlorophyceae]]) have been found to associate with the lichen-forming fungi.&lt;ref name=Friedl1996&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Photobionts |title=Lichen Biology |author1=Friedl, T. |author2=Büdel B. |editor-last=Nash III |editor-first=T.H. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular fungus species and algal species are not necessarily always associated together in a lichen. One fungus, for example, can form lichens with a variety of different algae. The [[thalli#thallus|thalli]] produced by a given fungal symbiont with its differing partners will be similar, and the secondary metabolites identical, indicating that the fungus has the dominant role in determining the morphology of the lichen. Further, the same algal species can occur in association with different fungal partners. Lichens are known in which there is one fungus associated with two or even three algal species. Rarely, the reverse can occur, and two or more fungal species can interact to form the same lichen.&lt;ref name=Rikkinen1995/&gt;

===Green algae===
About 90% of all known lichens have a green alga as a symbiont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/819628036 |title=Lichen Biology |date=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |others=Nash, Thomas H. |isbn=1281751391 |oclc=819628036}}&lt;/ref&gt; “[[Clorococcoid]]” means a green alga ([[Chlorophyta]]) that has single cells that are [[globose]], which is common in lichens.&lt;ref name=ASLGAF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lichens.lastdragon.org/faq/glossary1.html |series=Alan Silverside's Lichen Glossary  |title=Entries ‘A’-‘F’ |first=Alan |last=Silverside}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was once classified in the order [[Chlorococcales]], which one may find stated in older literature, but new DNA data shows many independent lines of evolution exist among this formerly large taxonomic group. [[Chlorococcales]] is now a relatively small order and may no longer include any lichen photobionts.

The term “'''[[Trebouxioid]]'''” refers to members of the [[Trebouxia]] algae or other algae that resemble them: a clorococcoid green algae photobiont in the genus ''[[Trebouxia]]''. Algae that resemble members of the [[Trebouxia]] are presumed to be in the class [[Trebouxiophyceae]] and go by the same descriptive name (''[[Trebouxioid]]'').&lt;ref name=ASLGPZ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lichens.lastdragon.org/faq/glossary3.html |series=Alan Silverside's Lichen Glossary |title=Entries ‘P’-‘Z’ |first=Alan |last=Silverside}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trebouxia]] was once included here, but is now considered to be in a separate class [[Trebouxiophyceae]].

===Cyanolichens===
Although the photobionts are almost always green algae ([[chlorophyta]]), sometimes the lichen contains a blue-green alga instead ([[cyanobacteria]], not really an alga), and sometimes both types of photobionts are found in the same lichen.

A [[cyanolichen]] is a lichen with a cyanobacterium as its main photosynthetic component ([[photobiont]]).&lt;ref name=ASLGAF/&gt;
Many cyanolichens are small and black, and have [[limestone]] as the substrate.

Another cyanolichen group, the jelly lichens ( e.g., from the genera ''[[Collema]]'' or ''[[Leptogium]]'') are large and [[foliose]] (e.g., species of ''[[Peltigera]]'', ''[[Lobaria]]'', and ''[[Degelia]]''. These lichen species are grey-blue, especially when dampened or wet. Many of these characterize the Lobarion communities of higher rainfall areas in western Britain, e.g., in the [[Celtic Rainforest]].

==Parasitic fungi are separate==
Some fungi can only be found living on lichens as [[obligate]] [[parasite]]s; They are not considered part of the lichen. These are referred to as “[[lichenolous fungi]]”.

==Description==
'''Taqbil''' in Arabic literally means '''Kissing'''.  In [[Hadhramaut]], the Sayyid people receive gestures of respect from the rest of population in recognition of their descent from [[Muhammad]]. These gestures include the method of greeting, in which their hand (usually right hand) is kissed and/or sniffed.  This hand-kissing is performed even when the recipient is still a child or a person without any special distinction in terms of religious knowledge or piety, in recognition of the [[nobility]] of the bloodline rather than the merits of the particular individual.&lt;ref name="edge"/&gt;  This tradition of Taqbil was called ''Shamma'' in Hadhramaut.&lt;ref name="mapilla"&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xlb5BrabQd8C| title=Mappila Muslims: A Study on Society and Anti Colonial Struggles| first=Husain |last=Raṇṭattāṇi| publisher=Other Books| year=2007| isbn=978-8-190388788| accessdate=August 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, some members of the [[Sayyid|Sada]] continued to put forth justifications for their special treatment.  One of the prominent jurisprudents at the time, Abdurrahman bin Muhammad al-Mashhoor addressed the matter of the special status of the [[Ba'Alawi sada|Sada]] in Hadhramaut.  He asserted that "the descendants of the Prophet were the most favored of people, and the descendants of [[Ba 'Alawi sada|'Alawi]] the most favored of them all" because of religious learning and practice, their high moral standing, their blessedness and their piety.  In response to a question as to the correctness of the practice of kissing the hands of ''Sada'', he asserted that it was correct according to [[Shafi'i]] authorities.&lt;ref name="edge"/&gt;

The tradition currently is no longer common among [[Hadhrami people|Hadhrami]], except when a person greets a respected Sayyid out of paying respect to his knowledge-ability or piety  (such as to a [[Habib]] or a [[Shaikh]]) .

The '''University of Sydney Nano Institute''' (Sydney Nano) is a flagship multidisciplinary research institute at the [[University of Sydney]] in [[Camperdown, New South Wales|Camperdown]], [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], focused on transforming our economy, society and everyday life through multidisciplinary research in [[nanoscale]] science and technology. It is one of ten multidisciplinary research institutes at the University of Sydney including the [[Charles Perkins Centre]] and the [[Brain and Mind Centre]].

== Location and facilities ==
Sydney Nano is headquartered at the [[Sydney Nanoscience Hub]], a purpose-built facility for nanoscience research completed in 2015 and located on the University's Camperdown/Darlington campus. Sydney Nano's research is also conducted in other science, engineering and medical facilities across the University.

==Early developments==
[[File:Thales Lebiedzki Rahl.jpg|thumb|Detail of the right-hand facade fresco, showing [[Thales of Miletus]], [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens]].]]

* 28th century BC &amp;mdash; [[Ancient Egypt]]ian texts describe [[electric fish]]. They refer to them as the "Thunderer of the [[Nile]]", and described them as the "protectors" of all other fish.&lt;ref name="moller"&gt;{{citation|title=Review: Electric Fish|first=Peter|last=Moller|journal=BioScience|volume=41|issue=11|date=December 1991|pages=794–6 [794]|doi=10.2307/1311732|jstor=1311732|last2=Kramer|first2=Bernd}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 6th century BC &amp;mdash; [[Greek philosophy|Greek]] philosopher [[Thales of Miletus]] observes that rubbing fur on various substances, such as [[amber]], would cause an attraction between the two, which is now known to be caused by [[static electricity]]. He noted that the amber buttons could attract light objects such as hair and that if the amber was rubbed sufficiently a spark would jump.
* 424 BC [[Aristophanes]] "lens" is a glass globe filled with water.([[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] says that it can be used to read letters ''no matter how small or dim'')&lt;ref name=King&gt;''The history of the telescope'' by Henry C.

* 4th century BC [[Mozi|Mo Di]] first mentions the [[camera obscura]], a pin-hole camera.
* 3rd century BC [[Euclid]] is the first to write about reflection and refraction and notes that light travels in straight lines&lt;ref name=King/&gt;
* 3rd century BC &amp;mdash; The [[Baghdad Battery]] is dated from this period. It resembles a [[galvanic cell]] and is believed by some to have been used for [[electroplating]], although there is no common consensus on the purpose of these devices nor whether they were, indeed, even electrical in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/2804257.stm |first=Arran |last=Frood  |title=Riddle of 'Baghdad's batteries' |newspaper=BBC News |date=27 February 2003 |accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1st century BC &amp;mdash; Pliny in his Natural History records the story of a shepherd Magnes who discovered the magnetic properties of some iron stones, "''it is said, made this discovery, when, upon taking his herds to pasture, he found that the nails of his shoes and the iron ferrel of his staff adhered to the ground.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:latinLit:phi0978.phi001.perseus-eng1:1.dedication |author=Pliny the Elder |title=The Natural History |chapter=Dedication|series=Perseus Collection: Greek and Roman Materials|publisher=Department of the Classics, Tufts University |accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 130 AD. &amp;mdash; [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemy]] (in his work ''Optics'') wrote about the properties of [[light]] including: [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]], and [[color]] and tabulated [[angle]]s of [[refraction]] for several media
* 8th century AD &amp;mdash; Electric fish are reported by [[Islamic geography|Arabic naturalists]] and [[Islamic medicine|physicians]].&lt;ref name="moller"/&gt;
* 1021 &amp;mdash; [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) writes the ''[[Book of Optics]]'', studying  [[Visual perception|vision]].
* 1088 &amp;mdash; [[Shen Kuo]] first recognizes [[magnetic declination]].

* 14th century AD &amp;mdash; Possibly the earliest and nearest approach to the discovery of the identity of [[lightning]], and [[electricity]] from any other source, is to be attributed to the [[Arabs]], who before the 15th century had the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for lightning (''raad'') applied to the [[electric ray]].&lt;ref name="EncyclopediaAmericana"&gt;''The [[Encyclopedia Americana]]; a library of universal knowledge'' (1918), [[New York City|New York]]: Encyclopedia Americana Corp.&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1550 &amp;mdash; [[Gerolamo Cardano]] writes about electricity in ''De Subtilitate'' distinguishing, perhaps for the first time, between electrical and magnetic forces.

==17th century==
* 1600 &amp;mdash; [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] publishes ''De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure'' ("On the Magnet and Magnetic bodies, and on that Great Magnet the Earth"), Europe's then current standard on electricity and magnetism. He experimented with and noted the different character of electrical and magnetic forces. In addition to known ancient Greeks' observations of the electrical properties of rubbed amber, he experimented with a needle balanced on a pivot, and found that the needle was non-directionally affected by many materials such as alum, arsenic, hard resin, [[Jet (lignite)|jet]], glass, gum-mastic, mica, rock-salt, sealing wax, slags, sulfur, and precious stones such as amethyst, [[beryl]], diamond, opal, and sapphire. He noted that electrical charge could be stored by covering the body with a non-conducting substance such as silk. He described the method of artificially magnetizing iron. His [[terrella]] (little earth), a sphere cut from a lodestone on a metal lathe, modeled the earth as a lodestone (magnetic iron ore) and demonstrated that every lodestone has fixed poles, and how to find them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Henry Smith |last=Williams |title=A history of science |volume=2 |url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/sci/history/AHistoryofScienceVolumeII/chap18.html |chapter=Part IV.

He experimented with such physical models in an attempt to explain problems in [[navigation]] due varying properties of the [[magnetic compass]] with respect to their location on the earth, such as [[magnetic declination]] and magnetic inclination. His experiments explained the [[Dip circle|dipping of the needle]] by the magnetic attraction of the earth, and were used to predict where the vertical dip would be found. Such magnetic inclination was described as early as the 11th century by [[Shen Kuo]] in his ''Meng Xi Bi Tan'' and further investigated in 1581 by retired mariner and [[Compasssmith|compass maker]] [[Robert Norman]], as described in his pamphlet, ''The Newe Attractive.'' The gilbert, a unit of [[magnetomotive force]] or [[magnetic potential]], was named in his honor.

* 1705 &amp;mdash; [[Francis Hauksbee (scientist)|Francis Hauksbee]] improves von Guericke's [[electrostatic generator]] by using a glass globe and generates the first sparks by approaching his finger to the rubbed globe.
* 1728 &amp;mdash; [[James Bradley]] discovers the [[Aberration of light|aberration]] of starlight and uses it to determine that the [[speed of light]] is about 283,000 [[kilometre|km]]/[[second|s]]
* 1729 &amp;mdash; [[Stephen Gray (scientist)|Stephen Gray]] and the Reverend [[Granville Wheler]] experiment to discover that electrical "virtue," produced by rubbing a glass tube, could be transmitted over an extended distance (nearly 900&amp;nbsp;ft (about 270&amp;nbsp;m)) through thin iron wire using silk threads as insulators, to deflect leaves of brass. This has been described as the beginning of electrical communication.&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=David H.|last2=Clark|first2=Stephen P.H.|title=Newton's tyranny : the suppressed scientific discoveries of Stephen Gray and John Flamsteed|date=2001|publisher=Freeman|location=New York|isbn=9780716747017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} This was also the first distinction between the roles of conductors and insulators (names applied by [[John Theophilus Desaguliers|John Desaguliers]], mathematician and [[Royal Society]] member, who stated that Gray "has made greater variety of electrical experiments than all the philosophers of this and the last age.")&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} Georges-Louis LeSage built a [[electrical telegraph|static electricity telegraph]] in 1774, based upon the same principles discovered by Gray.
* 1732 &amp;mdash; [[C. F. du Fay]] Shows that all objects, except metals, animals, and liquids, can be electrified by rubbing them and that metals, animals and liquids could be electrified by means of an electrostatic generators
* 1734 &amp;mdash; [[C. F. du Fay|Charles François de Cisternay DuFay]] (inspired by Gray's work to perform electrical experiments) dispels the effluvia theory by his paper in Volume 38 of the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society,'' describing his discovery of the distinction between two kinds of electricity: "resinous," produced by rubbing bodies such as amber, copal, or [[Lac|gum-lac]] with silk or paper, and "vitreous," by rubbing bodies as glass, rock crystal, or precious stones with hair or wool. He also posited the principle of mutual attraction for unlike forms and the repelling of like forms and that "from this principle one may with ease deduce the explanation of a great number of other phenomena." The terms resinous and vitreous were later replaced with the terms "positive" and "negative" by [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]] and Benjamin Franklin.
* 1737 &amp;mdash; [[C. F. du Fay]] and [[Francis Hauksbee the younger]]{{fact|date=May 2013}} independently discover two kinds of frictional electricity: one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin (later identified as positive and negative electrical charges).
* 1740 &amp;mdash; [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], in ''Mémoire sur la réfraction des corps solides'', explains the process of [[refraction]].
* 1745 &amp;mdash; [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] of Leiden (Leyden) independently discovers the [[Leyden jar|Leyden (Leiden) jar]], a primitive [[capacitor]] or "condenser" (term coined by Volta in 1782, derived from the Italian ''condensatore''), with which the transient electrical energy generated by current friction machines could now be stored. He and his student Andreas Cunaeus used a glass jar filled with water into which a brass rod had been placed. He charged the jar by touching a wire leading from the electrical machine with one hand while holding the outside of the jar with the other. The energy could be discharged by completing an external circuit between the brass rod and another conductor, originally his hand, placed in contact with the outside of the jar. He also found that if the jar were placed on a piece of metal on a table, a shock would be received by touching this piece of metal with one hand and touching the wire connected to the electrical machine with the other.
* 1745 &amp;mdash; [[Ewald Georg von Kleist]] of independently invents the capacitor: a glass jar coated inside and out with metal. The inner coating was connected to a rod that passed through the lid and ended in a metal sphere. By having this thin layer of glass insulation (a [[dielectric]]) between two large, closely spaced plates, von Kleist found the energy density could be increased dramatically compared with the situation with no insulator. [[Daniel Gralath]] improved the design and was also the first to combine several jars to form a battery strong enough to kill birds and small animals upon discharge.
* 1746 &amp;mdash; [[Leonhard Euler]] develops the wave theory of light refraction and dispersion
* 1747 &amp;mdash; [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]], while experimenting with a Leyden jar, observes that a discharge of static electricity causes [[electric current]] to flow and develops the concept of an electrical potential ([[voltage]]).
* 1752 &amp;mdash; [[Benjamin Franklin]] establishes the link between lightning and electricity by the flying a kite into a thunderstorm and transferring some of the charge into a Leyden jar and showed that its properties were the same as charge produced by an electrical machine. He is credited with utilizing the concepts of positive and negative charge in the explanation of then known electrical phenomenon. He theorized that there was an electrical fluid (which he proposed could be the [[Luminiferous ether#The history of light and aether|luminiferous ether]], which was used by others before and after him, to explain the [[Light#Wave_theor|wave theory of light]]) that was part of all material and all intervening space. The charge of any object would be neutral if the concentration of this fluid were the same both inside and outside of the body, positive if the object contained an excess of this fluid, and negative if there were a deficit. In 1749 he had documented the similar properties of lightning and electricity, such as that both an [[electric spark]] and a lightning flash produced [[light]] and sound, could kill animals, cause fires, melt metal, destroy or reverse the polarity of magnetism, and flowed through conductors and could be concentrated at sharp points. He was later able to apply the property of concentrating at sharp points by his invention of the lightning rod, for which he intentionally did not profit. He also investigated the Leyden jar, proving that the charge was stored on the glass and not in the water, as others had assumed.
* 1753 &amp;mdash; C. M. (of Scotland, possibly Charles Morrison, of Greenock or Charles Marshall, of Aberdeen)  proposes in the 17 February edition of Scots Magazine, an electrostatic telegraph system with 26 insulated wires, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet and each connected to electrostatic machines. The receiving charged end was to electrostatically attract a disc of paper marked with the corresponding letter.
* 1767 &amp;mdash; [[Joseph Priestley]] proposes an electrical inverse-square law
* 1774 &amp;mdash; [[Georges-Louis LeSage]] builds an electrostatic telegraph system with 26 insulated wires conducting Leyden-jar charges to pith-ball electroscopes, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet. Its range was only between rooms of his home.
* 1784 &amp;mdash; [[Henry Cavendish]] defines the [[electromagnetic induction|inductive capacity]] of [[dielectrics]] (insulators) and measures the specific inductive capacity of various substances by comparison with an air condenser.
* 1785 &amp;mdash; [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb|Charles Coulomb]] introduces the [[Coulomb's law|inverse-square law of electrostatics]]
* 1786 &amp;mdash; [[Luigi Galvani]] discovers "animal electricity" and postulates that animal bodies are storehouses of electricity. His invention of the voltaic cell leads to the invention the electric battery.
* 1791 &amp;mdash; [[Luigi Galvani]] discovers galvanic electricity and [[bioelectricity]] through experiments following an observation that touching exposed muscles in frogs' legs with a scalpel which had been close to a static electrical machine caused them to jump. He called this "animal electricity". Years of experimentation in the 1780s eventually led him to the construction of an arc of two different metals (copper and zinc for example) by connecting the two metal pieces and then connecting their open ends across the nerve of a frog leg, producing the same muscular contractions (by completing a circuit) as originally accidentally observed. The use of different metals to produce an electrical spark is the basis that led Alessandro Volta in 1799 to his invention of his voltaic pile, which eventually became the [[Battery (electricity)|galvanic battery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Henry Smith |last=Williams |title=A history of science |volume=3|url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/sci/history/AHistoryofScienceVolumeIII/chap46.html |chapter=VII. The Modern Development of Electricity and Magnetism|publisher=Worldwide School |accessdate=20 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1799 &amp;mdash; [[Alessandro Volta]], following Galvani's discovery of galvanic electricity, creates a [[voltaic pile|voltaic cell]] producing an electric current by the chemical action of several pairs of alternating copper (or silver) and zinc discs "piled" and separated by cloth or cardboard which had been soaked brine (salt water) or acid to increase conductivity. In '''1800''' he demonstrates the production of light from a glowing wire conducting electricity. This was followed in 1801 by his construction of the first [[electric battery]], by utilizing multiple voltaic cells. Prior to his major discoveries, in a letter of praise to the Royal Society 1793, Volta reported Luigi Galvani's experiments of the 1780s as the "most beautiful and important discoveries," regarding them as the foundation of future discoveries. Volta's inventions led to revolutionary changes with this method of the production of inexpensive, controlled electric current vs. existing frictional machines and Leyden jars. The electric battery became standard equipment in every experimental laboratory and heralded an age of practical applications of electricity.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} The unit [[volt]] is named for his contributions.
* 1800 &amp;mdash; [[William Herschel]] discovers [[infrared radiation]] from the Sun.
* 1800 &amp;mdash; [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]], [[Anthony Carlisle]] and [[Johann Ritter]] use electricity to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen, thereby discovering the process of [[electrolysis]], which led to the discovery of many other elements.
* 1800 &amp;mdash; [[Alessandro Volta]] invents the [[voltaic pile]], or "battery", specifically to disprove Galvani's animal electricity theory.

* 1802 &amp;mdash; [[Gian Domenico Romagnosi]], Italian legal scholar, discovers that electricity and magnetism are related by noting that a nearby voltaic pile deflects a magnetic needle. He published his account in an Italian newspaper, but this was overlooked by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martins|first=Roberto de Andrade|chapter=Romagnosi and Volta’s pile: early difficulties in the interpretation of Voltaic electricity|editor-last1=Bevilacqua|editor-first1=Fabio|editor-last2=Fregonese|editor-first2=Lucio|title=Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta and his Times|location=
Pavia |publisher=Ulrico Hoepli |volume=3 |pages=81–102}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1803 &amp;mdash; Thomas Young develops the [[Double-slit experiment]] and demonstrates the effect of [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]].
* 1806 &amp;mdash; [[Alessandro Volta]] employs a voltaic pile to decompose potash and soda, showing that they are the oxides of the previously unknown metals potassium and sodium. These experiments were the beginning of [[electrochemistry]].
* 1808 &amp;mdash; [[Étienne-Louis Malus]] discovers [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] by reflection
* 1809 &amp;mdash; Étienne-Louis Malus publishes the law of Malus which predicts the light intensity transmitted by two polarizing sheets
* 1809 &amp;mdash; [[Humphry Davy]] first publicly demonstrates the electric [[arc lamp|arc light]].
* 1811 &amp;mdash; [[François Jean Dominique Arago]] discovers that some quartz crystals continuously rotate the electric vector of light
* 1816 &amp;mdash; [[David Brewster]] discovers stress [[birefringence]]
* 1818 &amp;mdash; [[Siméon Poisson]] predicts the [[Arago spot|Poisson-Arago bright spot]] at the center of the shadow of a circular opaque obstacle
* 1818 &amp;mdash; [[François Jean Dominique Arago]] verifies the existence of the Poisson-Arago  bright spot
* 1820 &amp;mdash; [[Hans Christian Ørsted]], Danish physicist and chemist, unites the separate sciences of electricity and magnetism. He develops an experiment in which he notices a compass needle is deflected from [[Magnetic declination|magnetic north]] when an electric current from the battery he was using was switched on and off, convincing him that magnetic fields radiate from all sides of a live wire just as light and heat do, confirming a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. He also observes that the movement of the compass-needle to one side or the other depends upon the direction of the current. Following intensive investigations, he published his findings, proving that a changing electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows through a wire. The [[oersted]] unit of magnetic induction is named for his contributions.
* 1820 &amp;mdash; [[André-Marie Ampère]], professor of mathematics at the Ecole Polytechnique, a short time after learning of Ørsted's discovery that a magnetic needle is acted on by a voltaic current, conducts experiments and publishes a paper in ''[[Annales de Chimie et de Physique]]'' attempting to give a combined theory of electricity and magnetism. He shows that a coil of wire carrying a current behaves like an ordinary magnet and suggests that electromagnetism might be used in telegraphy. He mathematically develops [[Ampère's force law|Ampère's law]] describing the magnetic force between two electric currents. His mathematical theory explains known electromagnetic phenomena and predicts new ones. His laws of electrodynamics include the facts that parallel conductors currying current in the same direction attract and those carrying currents in the opposite directions repel one another. One of the first to develop electrical measuring techniques, he built an instrument utilizing a free-moving needle to measure the flow of electricity, contributing to the development of the [[galvanometer]]. In '''1821''', he proposed a telegraphy system utilizing one wire per "galvanometer" to indicate each letter, and reported experimenting successfully with such a system. However, in '''1824''', [[Peter Barlow (mathematician)|Peter Barlow]] reported its maximum distance was only 200 feet, and so was impractical.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In '''1826''' he publishes the ''Memoir on the Mathematical Theory of Electrodynamic Phenomena, Uniquely Deduced from Experience'' containing a mathematical derivation of the electrodynamic force law. Following Faraday's discovery of  electromagnetic induction in 1831, Ampère agreed that Faraday deserved full credit for the discovery.
* 1820 &amp;mdash; [[Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger]], German chemist, physicist, and professor, builds the first sensitive galvanometer, wrapping a coil of wire around a graduated compass, an acceptable instrument for actual measurement as well as detection of small amounts of electric current, naming it after Luigi Galvani.
* 1821 &amp;mdash; [[André-Marie Ampère]] announces his theory of electrodynamics, predicting the force that one current exerts upon another.
* 1821 &amp;mdash; [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]] discovers the [[thermoelectric effect]].
* 1821 &amp;mdash; [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] derives a mathematical demonstration that polarization can be explained only if light is ''entirely'' transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.
* 1825 &amp;mdash; [[Augustin Fresnel]] phenomenologically explains optical activity by introducing circular birefringence
* 1825 &amp;mdash; [[William Sturgeon]], founder of the first English Electric Journal, ''Annals of Electricity'', found that an iron core inside a helical coil of wire connected to a battery greatly increased the resulting magnetic field, thus making possible the more powerful [[electromagnet]]s utilizing a [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] core. Sturgeon also bent the iron core into a U-shape to bring the poles closer together, thus concentrating the magnetic field lines. These discoveries followed Ampère's discovery that electricity passing through a coiled wire produced a magnetic force and that of [[François Arago|Dominique François Jean Arago]] finding that an iron bar is magnetized by putting it inside the coil of current-carrying wire, but Arago had not observed the increased strength of the resulting field while the bar was being magnetized.
* 1826 &amp;mdash; [[Georg Simon Ohm]] states his [[Ohm's law]] of [[electrical resistance]] in the journals of Schweigger and Poggendorff, and also published in his landmark pamphlet ''Die galvanische Kette mathematisch bearbeitet'' in '''1827'''. The unit [[ohm (unit)|ohm]] (Ω) of electrical resistance has been named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/ohmlawexperiments.html |title=Georg Simon Ohm: The Discovery of Ohm's Law |publisher=Juliantrubin.com |accessdate=2011-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1829 &amp; 1830 &amp;mdash; [[Francesco Zantedeschi]] publishes papers on the production of electric currents in closed circuits by the approach and withdrawal of a magnet, thereby anticipating Michael Faraday's classical experiments of 1831.
* 1831 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] began experiments leading to his discovery of the law of [[electromagnetic induction]], though the discovery may have been anticipated by the work of Francesco Zantedeschi. His breakthrough came when he wrapped two insulated coils of wire around a massive iron ring, bolted to a chair, and found that upon passing a current through one coil, a momentary electric current was induced in the other coil. He then found that if he moved a magnet through a loop of wire, or vice versa, an electric current also flowed in the wire. He then used this principle to construct the [[Dynamo|electric dynamo]], the first electric power generator. He proposed that electromagnetic forces extended into the empty space around the conductor, but did not complete that work. Faraday's concept of lines of flux emanating from charged bodies and magnets provided a way to visualize electric and magnetic fields. That mental model was crucial to the successful development of electromechanical devices which were to dominate the 19th century. His demonstrations that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field,  mathematically modeled by [[Faraday's law of induction]], would subsequently become one of [[Maxwell's equations]]. These consequently evolved into the generalization of [[Field (physics)|field theory]].
* 1831 &amp;mdash; [[Macedonio Melloni]] uses a [[thermopile]] to detect infrared radiation
* 1832 &amp;mdash; [[Pavel Schilling|Baron Pavel L'vovitch Schilling]] (Paul Schilling) creates the first electromagnetic telegraph, consisting of a single-needle system in which a code was used to indicate the characters. Only months later, Göttingen professors [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] constructed a telegraph that was working two years before Schilling could put his into practice. Schilling demonstrated the long-distance transmission of signals between two different rooms of his apartment and was the first to put into practice a binary system of signal transmission.
* 1833 &amp;mdash; [[Heinrich Lenz]] states [[Lenz's law]]: if an increasing (or decreasing) magnetic flux induces an [[Electromotive force|electromotive force (EMF)]], the resulting current will oppose a further increase (or decrease) in magnetic flux, i.e., that an induced current in a closed conducting loop will appear in such a direction that it opposes the change that produced it. Lenz's law is one consequence of the principle of [[conservation of energy]]. If a magnet moves towards a closed loop, then the induced current in the loop creates a field that exerts a force opposing the motion of the magnet. Lenz's law can be derived from [[Faraday's law of induction]] by noting the negative sign on the right side of the equation. He also independently discovered [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]] in '''1842'''; to honor his efforts, Russian physicists refer to it as the "Joule-Lenz law."
* 1833 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] announces his law of [[Electrochemical_equivalent#Electrochemical_equivalents|electrochemical equivalents]]
* 1834 &amp;mdash; [[Heinrich Lenz]] determines the direction of the induced [[electromotive force]] (emf) and [[Electric current|current]] resulting from [[electromagnetic induction]]. [[Lenz's law]] provides a physical interpretation of the choice of sign in [[Faraday's law of induction]] (1831), indicating that the induced emf and the change in flux have opposite signs.
* 1834 &amp;mdash; [[Jean-Charles Peltier]] discovers the [[Peltier effect]]: heating by an electric current at the junction of two different metals.
* 1835 &amp;mdash; [[Joseph Henry]] invents the [[relay|electric relay]], which is an electrical switch by which the change of a weak current through the windings of an electromagnet will attract an armature to open or close the switch. Because this can control (by opening or closing) another, much higher-power, circuit, it is in a broad sense a form of electrical amplifier. This made a practical electric telegraph possible. He was the first to coil insulated wire tightly around an iron core in order to make an extremely powerful electromagnet, improving on William Sturgeon’s design, which used loosely coiled, uninsulated wire. He also discovered the property of [[self inductance]] independently of Michael Faraday.

* 1836 &amp;mdash; [[David Alter|Dr. David Alter]] invents and demonstrates to witnesses the first American electric telegraph in Elderton, Pennsylvania. In a later interview in the book, ''Biographical and Historical Cyclopedia of Indiana and Armstrong Counties'' he states: "I may say that there is no connection at all between the telegraph of Morse and others and that of myself...Professor Morse most probably never heard of me or my Elderton telegraph." In '''1840''' he invents an electric buggy, forerunner of the automobile. His inventions also include an electric clock and a short-range type of telephone, forerunner to Alexander Graham Bell's telephone. He is also credited with the origins of Spectrum Analysis by his idea that every element has its own emission spectrum, and an expansion of spectrum analysis to include the optical properties of gases.
* 1837 &amp;mdash; [[Samuel Morse]] develops an alternative electrical telegraph design capable of transmitting long distances over poor quality wire. He and his assistant [[Alfred Vail]] develop the [[Morse code]] signaling alphabet. In '''1838''' Morse successfully tested the device at the Speedwell Ironworks near [[Morristown, New Jersey]], and publicly demonstrated it to a scientific committee at the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. The first electric telegram using this device was sent by Morse on 24 May, '''1844''' from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., bearing the message "[[Book of Numbers|What hath God wrought]]?"
* 1838 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] uses Volta's battery to discover [[cathode ray]]s.
* 1839 &amp;mdash; [[Alexandre Edmond Becquerel]] observes the [[photoelectric effect]] with an electrode in a conductive solution exposed to light.
* 1840 &amp;mdash; [[James Prescott Joule]] formulates [[Joule's first law|Joule's Law]] (sometimes called the Joule-Lenz law) quantifying the amount of heat produced in a circuit as proportional to the product of the time duration, the resistance, and the square of the current passing through it.
* 1845 &amp;mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] discovers that light propagation in a material can be influenced by external [[magnetic field]]s ([[Faraday effect]])
* 1849 &amp;mdash; [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] and [[Jean-Bernard Foucault]] measure the speed of light to be about 298,000&amp;nbsp;km/s

* 1861 &amp;mdash; the [[First Transcontinental Telegraph|first transcontinental telegraph system]] spans North America by connecting an existing network in the eastern United States to a small network in California by a link between Omaha and Carson City via Salt Lake City. The slower Pony Express system ceased operation a month later.
* 1864 &amp;mdash; [[James Clerk Maxwell]] publishes his papers on a dynamical theory of the [[electromagnetic field]]
* 1865 &amp;mdash; [[James Clerk Maxwell]] publishes his landmark paper [[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]], in which [[Maxwell's equations]] demonstrated that electric and [[magnetism|magnetic]] forces are two complementary aspects of [[electromagnetism]]. He shows that the associated complementary electric and magnetic fields of electromagnetism travel through space, in the form of waves, at a constant velocity of 3.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s. He also proposes that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation and that waves of oscillating electric and magnetic fields travel through empty space at a speed that could be predicted from simple electrical experiments. Using available data, he obtains a velocity of 310,740,000&amp;nbsp;m/s and states "This velocity is so nearly that of light, that it seems we have strong reason to conclude that light itself (including radiant heat, and other [[radiation]]s if any) is an electromagnetic disturbance in the form of waves propagated through the electromagnetic field according to electromagnetic laws."

In '''1879''' he produces a high-resistance lamp in a very high vacuum; the lamp lasts hundreds of hours. While the earlier inventors had produced electric lighting in lab conditions, Edison concentrated on commercial application and was able to sell the concept to homes and businesses by mass-producing relatively long-lasting light bulbs and creating a complete system for the generation and distribution of electricity.
* 1879 &amp;mdash; [[Joseph Stefan|Jožef Stefan]] discovers the [[Stefan-Boltzmann law|Stefan-Boltzmann radiation law]] of a [[black body]] and uses it to calculate the first sensible value of the temperature of the Sun's surface to be 5700 [[Kelvin|K]]

* 1888 &amp;mdash; [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz|Heinrich Hertz]] demonstrates the existence of electromagnetic waves by building an apparatus that produced and detected UHF radio waves (or microwaves in the UHF region). He also found that radio waves could be transmitted through different types of materials and were reflected by others, the key to [[radar]]. His experiments explain [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]], [[refraction]], [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]], [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]], and [[velocity]] of electromagnetic waves.

* 1905 &amp;mdash; [[Albert Einstein]] proposes the [[Special Relativity|Theory of Special Relativity]], in which he rejects the existence of the [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] as unnecessary for explaining the propagation of electromagnetic waves. Instead, Einstein asserts ''as a [[postulate]]'' that the speed of light is constant in all [[inertial|inertial frames of reference]], and goes on to demonstrate a number of revolutionary (and highly counter-intuitive) consequences, including [[time dilation]], [[length contraction]], the [[relativity of simultaneity]], the [[relativistic mass|dependence of mass on velocity]], and the [[mass-energy equivalence|equivalence of mass and energy]].
* 1905 &amp;mdash; Einstein explains the [[photoelectric effect]] by extending Planck's idea of light quanta, or [[photons]], to the absorption and emission of [[photoelectrons]].  Einstein would later receive the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this discovery, which launched the [[quantum mechanics|quantum revolution]] in physics.
* 1911 &amp;mdash; [[Superconductivity]] is discovered by [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]], who was studying the resistivity of solid mercury at cryogenic temperatures using the recently discovered liquid helium as a refrigerant.

'''''United States v. Morgan''''', 346 U.S. 502 (1954), is a landmark decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] which provides the writ of [[coram nobis]] as the proper application to request federal post-conviction judicial review for those who have completed the conviction's incarceration.

==Background==
The ancient writ of [[coram nobis]] originated in the English judicial system during the sixteenth century. If a court discovered a factual mistake or error after the conclusion of a case, the writ could be issued by the court to correct the error.  The writ of coram nobis was identical to the [[Habeas corpus in the United States|writ of habeas corpus]]; except, the writ of habeas corpus was reserved exclusively for those who were held in prisons, and the writ of coram nobis was available to everyone else.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=fwps_papers|title=''Stigma of Conviction: Coram Nobis, Civil Disabilities, and the Right to Clear One's Name''|last=Wolitz|first=David|date=July 2009|publisher=The BYU Law Review|access-date=April 30, 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Judiciary Act of 1789]] provided courts in the United States the authority to issue [[writ|writs]] to achieve justice as long as the writ does not conflict with constitutional rights or legislative statutes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Judiciary Act of 1789]], 1 Stat. 81-82&lt;/ref&gt;  (In 1911, the authorization of the federal judiciary to issue writs was modified into 28 U. S. C. § 1651(a) and is known as the [[All Writs Act|“all-writs section of the Judicial Code”]].) In 1946, the writ of coram nobis was considered obsolete when Congress added Rule 60(e) to the [[Federal Rules of Civil Procedure]] which specifically abolished the writ of coram nobis in civil cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_60|title=Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 60|website=www.law.cornell.edu|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until this time, federal courts only used the writ of coram nobis to correct errors in federal civil cases because errors in federal criminal cases could be corrected with a writ of habeas corpus.  Thus, in its 1947 decision, ''United States v. Smith'', the Supreme Court observed “it is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where [the writ of coram nobis] would be necessary or appropriate.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15350111847978931898|title=''United States v. Smith'', 331 US 469, 475 n.4 (1947)|website=Scholar.google.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions about whether the writ of coram nobis would be necessary or appropriate resurfaced just one year later with the Act of June 25, 1948 which codified existing federal habeas corpus statutes and provided only those individuals in-custody access to the writ of habeas corpus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uscode.house.gov/statviewer.htm?volume=62&amp;page=967# Act of June 25, 1948]&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to the Act of June 25, 1948, the writ of habeas corpus was the sole application for United States federal courts to review convictions of those who had completed their incarceration.  Following the Act of June 25, 1948, federal courts were left to decide whether the act eliminated any review of convictions for those who had completed their incarceration or whether the writ of coram nobis (which had been limited to reviews of civil cases in US federal courts) could be expanded to include reviews of criminal cases for those who had completed their incarceration.

''Morgan'' resolved these questions by determining that those who had completed their incarceration could challenge their conviction through the writ of coram nobis.  Although the Supreme Court states in ''Carlisle v. United States'', “it is difficult to conceive of a situation in a federal criminal case today where [the writ of coram nobis] would be necessary or appropriate [for prisoners and others serving out a term of a federal conviction],”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11483498398561074985|title=''Carlisle v. United States'', 517 U.S. 416, 429 (1996)|website=Scholar.google.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Morgan'' provides when the writ of coram nobis is necessary or appropriate for those who are no longer in-custody.

==Case==
In 1939, nineteen-year-old Robert Patrick Morgan pled guilty to stealing three letters from the US Post Office and was sentenced in the [[United States District Court for the Northern District of New York]] to four years in federal prison; however, Morgan’s [[constitutional right|constitutional rights]] were violated because he was not provided an attorney nor did he waive his constitutional right to an attorney. Unfortunately for Morgan, he was unaware that his constitutional rights were violated until after he had completed his sentence. In 1950, Morgan was convicted of attempted burglary in a New York county court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1113&amp;context=fwps_papers|title=''Stigma of Conviction: Coram Nobis, Civil Disabilities, and the Right to Clear One's Name''|last=Wolitz|first=David|date=July 2009|publisher=The BYU Law Review|access-date=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of his 1939 federal conviction, the county court applied New York’s Multiple Offenders Law and sentenced Morgan to seven to ten years at [[Attica Correctional Facility|Attica Prison]].

In 1952, Morgan first became aware of the constitutional violations related to his 1939 federal conviction. As a result, he petitioned the district court for the writ of coram nobis. If successful, his state sentence would be reduced because he would no longer be considered a multiple offender. The district court denied Morgan’s petition on the ground that the coram nobis petition was to be treated as a habeas corpus petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, which was unavailable to Morgan because he was no longer in federal custody. Morgan appealed the district court’s decision to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]]. The case was argued before the appellate court on January 13, 1953. On February 5, 1953, the three-judge panel unanimously determined that Morgan was entitled to the writ of coram nobis and reversed the district court’s decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11147499741758364560|title=''United States v. Morgan'', 202 F.2d 67, 69 (1953)|website=Scholar.google.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the appellate court’s decision, the attorney’s office for the United States petitioned and was granted a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Morgan'', 345 U. S. 974 (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decision==
[[File:Warren Court 1953.jpg|thumb|250px|right|In a 5-4 decision, the United States Supreme Court held that federal courts have the authority to issue the writ of coram nobis to those who are no longer in custody.]]''United States v. Morgan'' was argued on October 19, 1953 and decided January 4, 1954. In a 5-4 decision, the Court agreed with the Second Circuit and held that federal courts have the authority under the all-writs section of the Judicial Code to issue the writ of coram nobis to those who are no longer in custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/346/502/|title=''United States v. Morgan'', 306 U.S. 502 (1954) syllabus|website=supreme.justia.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Forman Reed|Justice Stanley Reed]] wrote for the majority in ''Morgan'', which held:
* Federal District Courts, under the authority of the All-Writs Section, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a), may issue the writ of coram nobis. ''id.'' at 506-510.
* A motion for a writ of coram nobis “is a step in the criminal case” and “is of the same general character as a motion under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.” ''id.'' at 505, n.4.
* A writ of coram nobis should be allowed only under circumstances compelling such action to achieve justice. ''id.'' at 511.
* If no other remedy is available and sound reasons existing for failure to seek appropriate earlier relief, a motion of the writ of coram nobis must be heard by the federal court. ''id.'' at 512.
* Since adverse consequences resulting from the conviction persist after conclusion of a sentence, the petitioner is entitled to show that his conviction was invalid.  ''id.'' at 512-513.
* The writ of coram nobis may be issued to correct a constitutional violation. ''id.'' at 512-513.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/346/502/case.html|title=''United States v. Morgan'', 306 U.S. 502 (1954)|website=supreme.justia.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, ''Morgan'' broadened the writ of coram nobis, which had historically been issued only to correct [[question of fact|errors of fact]], to allow courts to also correct [[question of law|errors of law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18257773315166643768|title=''Hirabayashi v.

==Division of circuit courts==
[[File:US Court of Appeals and District Court map.svg|thumb|250px|right|Map of the United States Courts of Appeals]] Federal appellate courts are currently divided on the deadline to file an appeal of a district court’s decision of a case to petition for a writ of coram nobis. Most appellate courts provide 60 days to file an appeal; two other courts provide only 10 days to file an appeal. The source of this controversy is found in footnote 4 of the ''Morgan'' decision in which the Court held the writ of coram nobis “is a step in the criminal case” and also “of the same general character as one under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/346/502/case.html#F4|title=''United States v. Morgan'', 306 U.S. 502 (1954) footnote 4|website=supreme.justia.com|accessdate=2017-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Sixth]], [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit|Seventh]], and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth]] circuit courts held that the civil time limit should apply to coram nobis appeals because the writ of coram nobis is "of the same general character" as the writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2255. Habeas corpus petitions follow time limit guidelines of the civil rule which provides a 60-day time period to file an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Fed.R.App.P. 4(a)(1)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit|Eighth]] and [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]] circuit courts held that a writ of coram nobis is governed by the criminal time limit for filing appeals because it a "step in a criminal case." Criminal rules of appellate procedure only provide a 10-day time period to file an appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12590893338640158916|title=''United States v.

'''Sounding''' or '''urethral sounding''' is the medical use of probes called [[sound (medical instrument)|sound]]s to increase the inner diameter of the [[urethra]] and to locate obstructions in it. Sounds are also used to stretch the urethra in order to receive [[genital piercing]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

'''Urethral sounding''' and '''urethral play''' are also used to refer to this practice in a sexual context.

Urethral play can involve the introduction of either soft or rigid items into the [[urinary meatus|meatus]] of the penis (as well as farther in).  Objects such as sounds are usually only inserted about halfway into the glans and can usually be easily retrieved.  Other toys and items, such as catheters, may be introduced deeper; in some cases even into the bladder.  Some items may even be allowed to curl several times or expand within the bladder. This action in the male may be directly or indirectly associated with stimulation of the prostate gland and some types of bladder control.

== Risks ==
If not conducted carefully, sounding carries a risk of irritation, tearing of the urethra, or of [[urinary tract infection]].  Infections may become serious if they progress to the bladder or kidneys, and should be referred to a doctor.

The insertion of foreign bodies into the urethra can present serious medical problems: see [[urethral foreign body]].
