      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4376">In [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]], an '''action group''' or '''task group''' is a group of people joined temporarily to accomplish some task or take part in some organized [[collective action]].

As the members of the action group are brought together on a single occasion and then disband, they cannot be regarded as constituting a full-fledged [[social group]], for which they would need to interact recurrently in accordance with their [[social identity|social identities]].

==In shareholder context==
Action Groups are often formed by many [[shareholder]]s when they disagree with actions by the [[Board of Directors]] of a [[Public Company]] or the [[Government]] like the forced [[Nationalisation of Northern Rock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2009/12/22/appeal-bid-denied-for-northern-rock-shareholders-61634-25444230/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225142734/http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/2009/12/22/appeal-bid-denied-for-northern-rock-shareholders-61634-25444230/ |archivedate=2009-12-25 }} Appeal bid denied for Northern Rock shareholders".

[[Institutional investor]]s often find loose alliances with private investor lead shareholder association actions groups useful in applying mass political pressure or to publicly embarrass Directors at [[Annual general meeting]]s into making changes.

The largest established shareholder action group associations are Sveriges Aktiesparares Riksförbund (the Swedish Shareholders' Association) part of the Euroshareholders group in the UK ShareSoc and UKSA (UK Shareholder Association),. American Shareholders Association, [[Australian Shareholders Association]], and Japan [[Sōkaiya]] also have action groups.

==In Latin American context==
In Cuba and elsewhere in Latin America, the word "action group" ({{lang|es|grupo de acción}}) was given to violent activists who gathered together to perform violent guerrilla activities e.g. (see [[Antonio Guiteras]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Emilio Tro]], [[Lauro Blanco]], and [[Rolando Masferrer]] when young university students) [https://web.archive.org/web/20050817112813/http://www.cadal.org/articulos/nota.asp?id_nota=290][http://www.amigospais-guaracabuya.org/oagjs098.php].
Commonly regarded as gang-related killing there were said to have been 200 of these killings in the Grau administration alone.

The '''administration of justice''' is the process by which the [[legal system]] of a government is executed. The presumed goal of such administration is to provide [[justice]] for all those accessing the legal system. The phrase is also used commonly to describe a University degree (as in: a BA in Administration of Justice), which can be a prerequisite for a job in law enforcement or government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohlone.edu/instr/adminjustice/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807231503/http://ohlone.edu/instr/adminjustice/ |archivedate=2016-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia==
In ''Attorney General for New South Wales v Love'', the appellant argued that section 24 of the Act 9 Geo 4 c 83 did not have the effect applying the [[Nullum Tempus Act]] (9 Geo 3 c 16) (1768) to [[New South Wales]]. Counsel for the appellant said that ''Whicker v Hume''&lt;ref&gt;Whicker v Hume (1858) 7 HL 124&lt;/ref&gt; decided that section 24 referred not to laws generally, but only to laws as to modes of procedure, and that the Nullum Tempus Act did not deal merely with procedure. The Lord Chancellor said that the Act 9 Geo 4 c 83 ''prima facie'' "applied the Nullum Tempus Act to the Colony in question as much as if it had re-enacted it for that Colony." He then said:

{{Blockquote|Sect. 24 of that Act provides "that all the laws and statutes in force within the realm of England at the passing of this Act" (that is to say, the year 1828) "shall be applied in the administration of justice in the courts of New South Wales," and it is sought by construction to limit the words "all laws and statutes" by introducing into the section the words "having relation to procedure" or some equivalent expression. At least that is the only intelligible mode in which the argument can be supported, because the words which do occur in the section - "in the administration of justice" - would certainly include a limitation of the time within which actions can be brought, and their Lordships are of the opinion that the language of the section cannot be limited so as to exclude the statute, which for the reasons pointed out by the learned judges were and are so important in the administration of justice in the Colony.&lt;ref&gt;Attorney General for New South Wales v Love [1898] AC 679 at 685, [[Privy Council|PC]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Canada==
[[Section 92(14) of the Constitution Act, 1867]], also known as the administration of justice power, grants the provincial legislatures of Canada the authority to legislate on:
:14. The Administration of Justice in the Province, including the Constitution, Maintenance, and Organization of Provincial Courts, both of Civil and of Criminal Jurisdiction, and including Procedure in Civil Matters in those Courts.

===Ontario===
Section 1 of the Administration of Justice Act (RSO 1990 c A6) provides:

{{Blockquote|In this Act, "administration of justice" means the provision, maintenance and operation of,
:(a) the courts of justice of the Province of Ontario,
:(b) land registry offices,
:(c) jails, and
:(d) the offices of coroners and Crown Attorneys,
for the performance of their functions, including any functions delegated to such courts, institutions or offices or any official thereof by or under any Act; (“administration de la justice”)&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90a06 Digitised copy]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This provision was previously section 1 of the Administration of Justice Act (RSO 1980 c 6),&lt;ref&gt;(1982) 37 Ontario Reports 246 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Xj9SAQAAIAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt; which was previously section 1 of Administration of Justice Act (RSO 1970 c 6),&lt;ref&gt;(1995) Ontario Reports 387 and 389 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kEJSAQAAIAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt; which was previously section 1 of Administration of Justice Act 1968 (SO 1968 c 1) (17 Eliz 2 c 1).&lt;ref&gt;Ontario Law Reform Commission.

(1979) Ontario Reports 285 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TEFSAQAAIAAJ]&lt;/ref&gt; Queen's printer copies of the Statutes of the Province of Ontario 1968 describe this provision as "new".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/statutesofprovin1968onta Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt; This statute replaced the Administration of Justice Expenses Act (RSO 1960 c 5).

==Republic of Ireland==
"Offence against the administration of justice" is defined by [http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2010/en/act/pub/0027/sec0007.html section 7] of the [[Criminal Procedure Act 2010]].

==United Kingdom==
In England, the administration of justice is a [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|prerogative]] of the [[Crown of the United Kingdom|Crown]]. It may be exercised only through duly-appointed [[Judiciary of England and Wales|judges]] and [[Courts of England and Wales|courts]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Owen Hood Phillips|O. Hood Phillips]]. ''[[A First Book of English Law]]''. Fourth Edition. Sweet &amp; Maxwell. 1960. Page 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following matters and things pertain to the administration of justice: the organisation of the courts; the prerogative of justice, the [[prerogative of mercy]], and any prerogative power to create new courts; [[nolle prosequi]]; the appointment, tenure and immunity of judges; the immunity of other participants in legal proceedings; [[contempt of court]]; the composition and availability of juries, any requirement that their verdict be unanimous, and the allowances they receive; the branches of the legal profession; and the provision of [[legal aid]] and advice.&lt;ref&gt;O. Hood Phillips. ''A First Book of English Law''. Fourth Edition. Sweet &amp; Maxwell. 1960. Chapter 2. (These matters and things are discussed by the author  in a chapter titled "The Administration of Justice").&lt;/ref&gt;

The administration of justice is an act which is normally associated with the carrying on of the business of government. When a government does that act, it is thereby exercising its sovereignty. It would accordingly be a violation of British sovereignty for a foreign government to do that act in British territory without authorisation.&lt;ref&gt;McNair, Sir Arnold Duncan. Legal Effects of War. Second Edition. Cambridge University Press. 1944. Page 356.&lt;/ref&gt; Section 2 of the [[Visiting Forces Act 1952]] authorises foreign service courts to exercise their jurisdiction in the United Kingdom.

There are [[offences against the administration of justice]].&lt;ref&gt;Card, Richard. [[Card, Cross and Jones: Criminal Law]]. Twelfth Edition. Butterworths. 1992. {{ISBN|0 406 00086 7}}. Chapter 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone's Statutes on Criminal Law: 2004-2005. Fourteenth Edition. Part XIII.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the purpose of section 54 of the [[Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996]], the following are administration of justice offences:
*The offence of [[perverting the course of justice]]
*The offence under section 51(1) of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]]
*An offence of aiding, abetting, counselling, procuring, suborning or inciting another person to commit an offence under section 1 of the [[Perjury Act 1911]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/25/section/54 section 54(6)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The offence of perverting the course of justice has been referred to as "interfering with the administration of justice" and as "obstructing the administration of justice".&lt;ref&gt;The Law Commission. Offences relating to the Administration of Justice. Working Paper No 62. HMSO. 1975. Paragraph 10 at page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 6(c) of the [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]] provides that nothing in the foregoing provisions of that Act restricts liability for contempt of court in respect of conduct intended to impede or prejudice the administration of justice.

An [[arrestable offence]], other than one specified in Schedule 5 to the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]], was [[serious arrestable offence|serious]] for the purposes of that Act if it led to, or was intended or likely to lead to, amongst other things, serious interference with the administration of justice. An arrestable offence which consisted of making a threat was serious for the purposes of that Act if carrying out the threat would be likely to lead to, amongst other things, serious interference with the administration of justice.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/section/116/enacted sections 116(1) to (4) and (6)(b)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In any legal proceedings held in public, the court may, where it appears to be necessary for avoiding a substantial risk of prejudice to the administration of justice in those proceedings, or in any other proceedings pending or imminent, order that the publication of any report of the proceedings, or any part of the proceedings, be postponed for such period as the court thinks necessary for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Contempt of Court Act 1981]], section 4(2). Where in proceedings for any offence which is an administration of justice offence for the purposes of section 54 of the [[Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996]] it appears to the court that there is a possibility that (by virtue of that section) proceedings may be taken against a person for an offence of which he has been acquitted, section 4(2) of the Contempt of Court Act 1981 applies as if those proceedings were pending or imminent: The Contempt of Court Act 1981, section 4(2A).&lt;/ref&gt;

Information which is not exempt information by virtue of section 30 of the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]] is exempt information if its disclosure under that Act would, or would be likely to, prejudice the administration of justice.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]], [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/36/section/31 section 31(1)(c)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Albania]]n Soil Research Institute''' ({{lang-sq|Instituti i Kërkimit të Tokave}}) was a scientific research institute on soil research that was created in 1971 and discontinued in 2006.

==History==
The Soil Research Institute was created in [[Tirana]], [[Albania]] in 1971, as a continuation of a pre-existing institute of soil research then based in [[Kamëz]]. Its goal was the [[Pedology (soil study)|pedologic]] study on agricultural and non agricultural land, as well as topographic measurement on land in Albania. In 1996 the Institute of Study and Projection of Irrigation and Drainage Projects, which had been created in 1945, merged into the Soil Research Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akti.gov.al/kerkimishkencor/ministrite/doc_mbumk/InstiStudimeveTokave.pdf  From the Albanian government website description]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akti.gov.al/kerkimishkencor/ministrite/doc_mbumk/TeDhenatInstituteve.pdf Tatjana Dishnica on the history of the scientific agricultural institutes of Albania]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the institute was dissolved by law (government decree Nr. 515, as of 19 July 2006) as a nationwide reorganization occurred, following which new scientific institutions (called Transfer Centers of Agricultural Technology ({{lang-sq|Qendra e Transferimit të Teknologjive Bujqësore}})) were created.&lt;ref&gt;[http://80.78.70.231/pls/kuv/f?p=201:Vendim%20i%20KM:515:19.07.2006 Government decree to end the institution]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alcohol is a depressant. After consumption, alcohol causes the body’s systems to slow down. Often, feelings of [[drunkenness]] are associated with elation and happiness but other feelings of anger or depression can arise. Balance, judgment, and coordination are also negatively affected. One of the most significant short term side effects of alcohol is reduced inhibition. Reduced inhibitions can lead to an increase in sexual behavior.&lt;ref name="LC2" /&gt;

As testosterone is critical for libido and physical arousal, alcohol tends to have deleterious effects on male sexual performance. Studies have been conducted that indicate increasing levels of alcohol intoxication produce a significant degradation in male masturbatory effectiveness (MME). This degradation was measured by measuring blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and ejaculation latency.&lt;ref name="G4"&gt;

== In women ==
In women, the effects of alcohol on libido in the literature are mixed. Some women report that alcohol increases sexual arousal and desire, however, some studies show alcohol lower the physiological signs of arousal.&lt;ref name="B32"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ackerman|first2=KT|year=1995|title=Women, alcohol, and sexuality|journal=[[Recent Developments in Alcoholism]]|volume=12|pages=267–85|pmid=7624547|last1=Beckman|first1=LJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 study found that alcohol negatively affected how positive the sexual experience was in both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=M.

Also, because women have a higher percentage of body fat and less water in their bodies, alcohol can have a quicker, more severe impact. Women's bodies take longer to process alcohol; more precisely, a woman's body often takes one-third longer to eliminate the substance.&lt;ref name="LC22"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=George|first2=WH|year=1989|title=Alcohol and human sexuality: Review and integration|journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]]|volume=105|issue=3|pages=374–86|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.105.3.374|pmid=2660179|last1=Crowe|first1=LC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual behavior in women under the influence of alcohol is also different from men. Studies have shown that increased BAC is associated with longer orgasmic latencies and decreased intensity of orgasm.&lt;ref name="B32" /&gt; Some women report a greater [[sexual arousal]] with increased alcohol consumption as well as increased sensations of pleasure during orgasm. Because ejaculatory response is visual and can more easily be measured in males, orgasmic response must be measured more intimately. In studies of the female orgasm under the influence of alcohol, orgasmic latencies were measured using a [[vaginal photoplethysmograph]], which essentially measures vaginal blood volume.&lt;ref name="B32" /&gt;

Psychologically, alcohol has also played a role in sexual behavior. It has been reported that women who were intoxicated believed they were more sexually aroused than before consumption of alcohol.&lt;ref name="B32" /&gt; This psychological effect contrasts with the physiological effects measured, but refers back to the loss of inhibitions because of alcohol. Often, alcohol can influence the capacity for a woman to feel more relaxed and in turn, be more sexual. Alcohol may be considered by some women to be a sexual disinhibitor.&lt;ref name="B32" /&gt;

==Drug facilitated sexual assault==
{{main article|Drug facilitated sexual assault}}

Drug-facilitated sexual assault (DFSA), also known as predator rape, is a sexual assault carried out after the victim has become incapacitated due to having consumed [[alcohol]] or other [[drug]]s. The unofficial term "date rape drug" came into widespread usage in the early 1990s through U.S. news media reports. Researchers say that unlike other types of rape, DFSA is not a crime of physical violence: it is a crime of sexual [[hedonism]] and entitlement.&lt;ref name="Welner 2008"&gt;{{cite book | first1=Michael | last1=Welner | first2=Barbara | last2=Welner | chapter=Chapter 23: Drug-Facilitated Sex Assault | pages=445–462 | editor1-first=Robert R. | editor1-last=Hazelwood | editor2-first=Ann Wolbert | editor2-last=Burgess | title=Practical Aspects of Rape Investigation: A Multidisciplinary Approach | edition=4th | publisher=CRC Press | year=2008 | isbn=978-1-4200-6504-6 | doi=10.1201/9781420065053.ch23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A date rape drug, also called a predator drug, is any drug that can be used to assist in the execution of [[drug facilitated sexual assault]] (DFSA). The most common types of DFSA are those in which a victim ingested drugs willingly for recreational purposes, or had them administered surreptitiously:&lt;ref name="Lyman 2006 70"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyman|first=Michael D.|title=Practical drug enforcement|year=2006|publisher=CRC|location=Boca Raton, Fla.|isbn=978-0849398087|pages=70|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the latter type of [[assault]] that the term "date rape drug" most often refers to.

==Sexual risk-taking==
Alcohol intoxication is associated with an increased risk that people will become involved in risky sexual behaviours, such as [[unprotected sex]].&lt;ref name="G4"/&gt; It is unclear whether the two are linked or the [[personality type]]s of people who often drink large amounts of alcohol are more tolerant of risk-taking.

Alcohol is linked to a large proportion of unwanted outcomes associated with sex such as [[date rape]], [[unwanted pregnancy]] and [[sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;

=="Beer goggles"{{anchor|Beer_goggles}}== &lt;!-- [[Beer goggles]], [[Cider visor]], and [[Stella vision]] all redirect to this section --&gt;
"Beer goggles" is a slang term for the phenomenon in which consumption of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] lowers [[sexual inhibition]]s to the point that very little or no discretion is used when approaching or choosing sexual partners. The term is often humorously applied when an individual is observed making, and later regretting, advances towards a partner who would be deemed unattractive or inappropriate when sober. The "beer goggles" are considered to have distorted the "wearer's" vision, making unattractive people appear beautiful, or at least passably attractive.

A study published in 2003 supported the beer goggles hypothesis; however, it also found that another explanation is that regular drinkers tend to have personality traits that mean they find people more attractive, whether or not they are under the influence of alcohol at the time.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Apolista''' is a native [[South America]]n nation of western [[Bolivia]]. Sedentary farmers, hunters, gatherers and fishers, they spoke an [[Arawakan languages]] now [[List of endangered languages in South America|gravely endangered]], if not extinct. From 1713, they were gathered at a variety of missions with other nations, and rapidly lost their traditional culture to the point that a realistic census count is no longer possible.

It includes the arts and sciences of civil debate, [[dialogue]], conversation, and [[persuasion]]. It studies rules of [[inference]], [[logic]], and procedural rules in both [[Artificial intelligence|artificial]] and real world settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frans H.

Argumentation is used in [[law]], for example in trials, in preparing an argument to be presented to a court, and in testing the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of certain kinds of evidence. Also, argumentation scholars study the ''post hoc'' rationalizations by which organizational actors try to justify decisions they have made [[Irrationality|irrationally]].

Argumentation is one of four [[rhetorical modes]] (also known as ''modes of discourse''), along with [[Exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], [[description]], and [[narrative mode|narration]]. 

== Key components of argumentation ==
* Understanding and identifying arguments, either explicit or implied, and the goals of the participants in the different types of dialogue.
* Identifying the premises from which conclusions are derived
* Establishing the "[[Philosophical burden of proof|burden of proof]]" – determining who made the initial claim and is thus responsible for providing evidence why his/her position merits acceptance.
* For the one carrying the "burden of proof", the advocate, to marshal [[evidence]] for his/her position in order to convince or force the opponent's acceptance.  The method by which this is accomplished is producing valid, sound, and [[wikt:cogent|cogent]] arguments, devoid of weaknesses, and not easily attacked.
* In a debate, fulfillment of the burden of proof creates a burden of rejoinder. One must try to identify faulty reasoning in the opponent's argument, to attack the reasons/premises of the argument, to provide counterexamples if possible, to identify any [[fallacy|fallacies]], and to show why a valid conclusion cannot be derived from the reasons provided for his/her argument.

== Internal structure of arguments ==
Typically an argument has an internal structure, comprising the following
#a set of assumptions or [[premise]]s
#a method of reasoning or deduction and
#a conclusion or point.

An argument has one or more premises and one conclusion.

Often classical logic is used as the method of reasoning so that the conclusion follows logically from the assumptions or support.  One challenge is that if the set of assumptions is inconsistent then anything can follow logically from inconsistency. Therefore, it is common to insist that the set of assumptions be consistent. It is also good practice to require the set of assumptions to be the minimal set, with respect to set inclusion, necessary to infer the consequent.  Such arguments are called MINCON arguments, short for minimal consistent.  Such argumentation has been applied to the fields of law and medicine. A second school of argumentation investigates abstract arguments, where 'argument' is considered a primitive term, so no internal structure of arguments is taken on account.

In its most common form, argumentation involves an individual and an interlocutor or opponent engaged in dialogue, each contending differing positions and trying to persuade each other. Other types of dialogue in addition to persuasion are [[eristic]], [[information]] seeking, [[inquiry]], [[negotiation]], [[deliberation]], and the [[dialectical]] method (Douglas Walton). The dialectical method was made famous by [[Plato]] and his use of [[Socrates]] critically questioning various characters and historical figures.

==Argumentation and the grounds of knowledge==
Argumentation theory had its origins in [[foundationalism]], a theory of knowledge ([[epistemology]]) in the field of [[philosophy]]. It sought to find the grounds for claims in the forms (logic) and materials (factual laws) of a universal system of knowledge. But argument scholars gradually rejected Aristotle's systematic philosophy and the [[idealism]] in Plato and Kant. They questioned and ultimately discarded the idea that argument premises take their soundness from formal philosophical systems. The field thus broadened.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Gronbeck. "From Argument to Argumentation: Fifteen Years of Identity Crisis." Jack Rhodes and Sara Newell, ed.s ''Proceedings of the Summer Conference on Argumentation''. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl R. Wallace]]'s seminal essay, "The Substance of Rhetoric: Good Reasons" in the ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' (1963) 44, led many scholars to study "marketplace argumentation" – the ordinary arguments of ordinary people. The seminal essay on marketplace argumentation is Ray Lynn Anderson and C. David Mortensen's "Logic and Marketplace Argumentation" ''Quarterly Journal of Speech'' 53 (1967): 143–150.&lt;ref&gt;See Joseph W. Wenzel "Perspectives on Argument." Jack Rhodes and Sara Newell, ed.s Proceedings of the Summer Conference on Argumentation. 1980.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Zarefsky. "Product, Process, or Point of View? Jack Rhodes and Sara Newell, ed.s ''Proceedings of the Summer Conference on Argumentation''. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; This line of thinking led to a natural alliance with late developments in the [[sociology of knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;See Ray E. McKerrow. "Argument Communities: A Quest for Distinctions."&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars drew connections with recent developments in philosophy, namely the [[pragmatism]] of [[John Dewey]] and [[Richard Rorty]]. Rorty has called this shift in emphasis "the [[linguistic turn]]".

In this new hybrid approach argumentation is used with or without [[empirical]] evidence to establish convincing conclusions about issues which are moral, scientific, epistemic, or of a nature in which science alone cannot answer. Out of pragmatism and many intellectual developments in the humanities and social sciences, "non-philosophical" argumentation theories grew which located the formal and material grounds of arguments in particular intellectual fields.  These theories include [[informal logic]], [[social epistemology]], [[ethnomethodology]], [[speech acts]], the sociology of knowledge, the [[sociology of science]], and [[social psychology]]. These new theories are not non-logical or anti-logical. They find logical coherence in most communities of discourse. These theories are thus often labeled "sociological" in that they focus on the social grounds of knowledge.

==Approaches to argumentation in communication and informal logic==
In general, the label "argumentation" is used by communication scholars such as (to name only a few) Wayne E. Brockriede, Douglas Ehninger, [[Joseph W. Wenzel]], Richard Rieke, Gordon Mitchell, Carol Winkler, Eric Gander, [[Dennis S. Gouran]], [[Daniel J. O'Keefe]], Mark Aakhus, Bruce Gronbeck, James Klumpp, [[G. Thomas Goodnight]], [[Robin Rowland]], [[Dale Hample]], [[C. Scott Jacobs]], [[Sally Jackson]], [[David Zarefsky]], and [[Charles Arthur Willard]], while the term "[[informal logic]]" is preferred by philosophers, stemming from [[University of Windsor]] philosophers [[Ralph Johnson (philosopher)|Ralph H. Johnson]] and [[J. Anthony Blair]]. [[Harald Wohlrapp]] developed a criterion for ''validness'' (Geltung, Gültigkeit) as ''freedom of objections''.

[[Trudy Govier]], [[Doug Walton|Douglas Walton]], Michael Gilbert, Harvey Seigal, [[Michael Scriven]], and [[John Woods (logician)|John Woods]] (to name only a few) are other prominent authors in this tradition. Over the past thirty years, however, scholars from several disciplines have co-mingled at international conferences such as that hosted by the [[University of Amsterdam]] (the Netherlands) and the International Society for the Study of Argumentation (ISSA). Other international conferences are the biannual conference held at Alta, Utah sponsored by the (US) [[National Communication Association]] and [[American Forensics Association]] and conferences sponsored by the Ontario Society for the Study of Argumentation (OSSA).

Some scholars (such as Ralph H. Johnson) construe the term "argument" narrowly, as exclusively written discourse or even discourse in which all premises are explicit. Others (such as Michael Gilbert) construe the term "argument" broadly, to include spoken and even nonverbal discourse, for instance the degree to which a war memorial or propaganda poster can be said to argue or "make arguments". The philosopher [[Stephen Toulmin]] has said that an argument is a claim on our attention and belief, a view that would seem to authorize treating, say, propaganda posters as arguments. The dispute between broad and narrow theorists is of long standing and is unlikely to be settled. The views of the majority of argumentation theorists and analysts fall somewhere between these two extremes.

== Kinds of argumentation ==

===Conversational argumentation===
{{Main article|Conversation analysis|Discourse analysis}}
The study of naturally occurring conversation arose from the field of sociolinguistics. It is usually called ''conversation analysis.'' Inspired by ethnomethodology, it was developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s principally by the sociologist [[Harvey Sacks]] and, among others, his close associates [[Emanuel Schegloff]] and [[Gail Jefferson]]. Sacks died early in his career, but his work was championed by others in his field, and CA has now become an established force in sociology, anthropology, linguistics, speech-communication and psychology.&lt;ref&gt;Psathas, George (1995): Conversation Analysis, Thousand Oaks: Sage Sacks, Harvey. (1995). Lectures on Conversation. Blackwell Publishing. {{ISBN|1-55786-705-4}}. Sacks, Harvey, Schegloff, Emanuel A., &amp; Jefferson, Gail (1974).

Sequence Organization in Interaction: A Primer in Conversation Analysis, Volume 1, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. Ten Have, Paul (1999): Doing Conversation Analysis. A Practical Guide, Thousand Oaks: Sage.&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly influential in [[interactional sociolinguistics]], discourse analysis and discursive psychology, as well as being a coherent discipline in its own right. Recently CA techniques of sequential analysis have been employed by phoneticians to explore the fine phonetic details of speech.

Empirical studies and theoretical formulations by Sally Jackson and Scott Jacobs, and several generations of their students, have described argumentation as a form of managing conversational disagreement within communication contexts and systems that naturally prefer agreement.

===Mathematical argumentation===
{{Main article|Philosophy of mathematics}}

The basis of mathematical truth has been the subject of long debate. [[Frege]] in particular sought to demonstrate (see Gottlob Frege, [[The Foundations of Arithmetic]], 1884, and ''[[Begriffsschrift]]'', 1879) that arithmetical truths can be derived from purely logical axioms and therefore are, in the end, [[logical truth]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boolos|first1=George|title=Logic, logic, and logic|date=1999|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780674537675|edition=2nd print.|chapter=Chapter 9: Gottlob Frege and the Foundations of Arithmetic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was developed by [[Bertrand Russell|Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] in their ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. If an argument can be cast in the form of sentences in Symbolic Logic, then it can be tested by the application of accepted proof procedures. This has been carried out for Arithmetic using [[Peano axioms]]. Be that as it may, an argument in Mathematics, as in any other discipline, can be considered valid only if it can be shown that it cannot have true premises and a false conclusion.

===Scientific argumentation===
{{Main article|Philosophy of science|Rhetoric of science}}

Perhaps the most radical statement of the social grounds of scientific knowledge appears in Alan G.Gross's ''The Rhetoric of Science'' (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1990). Gross holds that science is rhetorical "without remainder",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Rhetoric of Science|last=Gross|first=Alan|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0674768734|location=|pages=33|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that scientific knowledge itself cannot be seen as an idealized ground of knowledge. Scientific knowledge is produced rhetorically, meaning that it has special epistemic authority only insofar as its communal methods of verification are trustworthy. This thinking represents an almost complete rejection of the foundationalism on which argumentation was first based.

===Interpretive argumentation===
{{Main article|Interpretive discussion}}

Interpretive argumentation is a dialogical process in which participants [[divergent thinking|explore]] and/or [[convergent thinking|resolve]] interpretations often of a [[text (literary theory)|text]] of any medium containing significant [[ambiguity]] in meaning.

Interpretive argumentation is pertinent to [[humanities|the humanities]], [[hermeneutics]], [[literary theory]], [[linguistics]], [[semantics]], [[pragmatics]], [[semiotics]], [[analytic philosophy]] and [[Analytic philosophy#Aesthetics|aesthetics]].  Topics in [[Interpretation (philosophy)#Conceptual interpretations|conceptual interpretation]] include [[Aesthetic interpretation|aesthetic]], [[Judicial interpretation|judicial]], [[Logical interpretation|logical]] and [[Religious interpretation|religious]] interpretation.  Topics in [[Interpretation (philosophy)#Scientific interpretation|scientific interpretation]] include [[scientific modeling]].

===Legal argumentation===
{{Main article|Oral argument|Closing argument}}

Legal arguments are spoken presentations to a judge or appellate court by a lawyer, or parties when representing themselves of the legal reasons why they should prevail. Oral argument at the appellate level accompanies written briefs, which also advance the argument of each party in the legal dispute. A closing argument, or summation, is the concluding statement of each party's counsel reiterating the important arguments for the trier of fact, often the jury, in a court case. A closing argument occurs after the presentation of evidence.

===Political argumentation===
{{Main article|Political argument}}

Political arguments are used by academics, media pundits, candidates for political office and government officials. Political arguments are also used by citizens in ordinary interactions to comment about and understand political events.&lt;ref&gt;Michael McGee. "The 'Ideograph' as a Unit of Analysis in Political Argument." Jack Rhodes and Sara Newell, eds. Proceedings of the Summer Conference on Argumentation. 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; The rationality of the public is a major question in this line of research. Political scientist [[Samuel L. Popkin]] coined the expression "[[low information voter]]s" to describe most voters who know very little about politics or the world in general.

In practice, a "[[low information voter]]" may not be aware of legislation that their representative has [[Sponsor (legislative)|sponsored]] in Congress.  A low-information voter may base their [[ballot box]] decision on a media sound-bite, or a flier received in the mail.  It is possible for a media sound-bite or campaign flier to present a political position for the [[incumbent]] candidate that completely contradicts the legislative action taken in the Capitol on behalf of the constituents.  It may only take a small percentage of the overall voting group who base their decision on the inaccurate information, a voter block of 10 to 12%, to swing an overall election result.  When this happens, the constituency at large may have been duped or fooled.  Nevertheless, the election result is legal and confirmed.  Savvy [[political consulting|Political consultants]] will take advantage of low-information voters and sway their votes with [[disinformation]] because it can be easier and sufficiently effective.  [[Fact checker]]s have come about in recent years to help counter the effects of such campaign tactics.

==Psychological aspects==
[[Psychology]] has long studied the non-logical aspects of argumentation.  For example, studies have shown that [[Ad nauseam|simple repetition of an idea]] is often a more effective method of argumentation than appeals to reason.  [[Propaganda]] often utilizes repetition.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Ellul, ''Propaganda'', Vintage, 1973, {{ISBN|0-394-71874-7}} {{ISBN|978-0394718743}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nazi rhetoric has been studied extensively as, inter alia, a repetition campaign.

Empirical studies of communicator credibility and attractiveness, sometimes labeled ''charisma,'' have also been tied closely to empirically-occurring arguments. Such studies bring argumentation within the ambit of persuasion theory and practice.

Some psychologists such as William J. McGuire believe that the [[syllogism]] is the basic unit of human reasoning. They have produced a large body of empirical work around McGuire's famous title "A Syllogistic Analysis of Cognitive Relationships". A central line of this way of thinking is that logic is contaminated by psychological variables such as "wishful thinking", in which subjects confound the likelihood of predictions with the desirability of the predictions. People hear what they want to hear and see what they expect to see. If planners want something to happen they see it as likely to happen. If they hope something will not happen, they see it as unlikely to happen. Thus smokers think that they personally will avoid cancer, promiscuous people practice unsafe sex, and teenagers drive recklessly.

==Theories==

===Argument fields===
[[Stephen Toulmin]] and [[Charles Arthur Willard]] have championed the idea of argument fields, the former drawing upon [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Ludwig Wittgenstein's]] notion of [[language-game|language games]], (Sprachspiel) the latter drawing from communication and argumentation theory, sociology, political science, and social epistemology. For Toulmin, the term "field" designates discourses within which arguments and factual claims are grounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first = Stephen E.|last = Toulmin|title= The Uses of Argument|date = 1958|publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 978-0521092302}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For Willard, the term "field" is interchangeable with "community", "audience", or "readership".&lt;ref&gt;Charles Arthur Willard. "Some Questions About Toulmin's View of Argument Fields." Jack Rhodes and Sara Newell, eds. ''Proceedings of the Summer Conference on Argumentation''. 1980. "Field Theory: A Cartesian Meditation." George Ziegelmueller and Jack Rhodes, eds. ''Dimensions of Argument: Proceedings of the Second Summer Conference on Argumentation.''&lt;/ref&gt; Along similar lines, G. Thomas Goodnight has studied "spheres" of argument and sparked a large literature created by younger scholars responding to or using his ideas.&lt;ref&gt;G. T. Goodnight, "The Personal, Technical, and Public Spheres of Argument." ''Journal of the American Forensics Association.'' (1982) 18:214-227.&lt;/ref&gt; The general tenor of these field theories is that the premises of arguments take their meaning from social communities.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce E. Gronbeck. "Sociocultural Notions of Argument Fields: A Primer." George Ziegelmueller and Jack Rhodes, eds. ''Dimensions of Argument: Proceedings of the Second Summer Conference on Argumentation.'' (1981) 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Field studies might focus on social movements, issue-centered publics (for instance, pro-life versus pro-choice in the abortion dispute), small activist groups, corporate public relations campaigns and issue management, scientific communities and disputes, political campaigns, and intellectual traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rowland, "Purpose, Argument Fields, and Theoretical Justification." ''Argumentation.'' vol. 22 Number 2 (2008) 235-250.&lt;/ref&gt; In the manner of a sociologist, ethnographer, anthropologist, participant-observer, and journalist, the field theorist gathers and reports on real-world human discourses, gathering case studies that might eventually be combined to produce high-order explanations of argumentation processes. This is not a quest for some master language or master theory covering all specifics of human activity. Field theorists are agnostic about the possibility of a single grand theory and skeptical about the usefulness of such a theory. Theirs is a more modest quest for "mid-range" theories that might permit generalizations about families of discourses.

===Stephen E. Toulmin's contributions===
By far, the most influential theorist has been [[Stephen Toulmin]], the Cambridge educated philosopher and student of Wittgenstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Loui|first=Ronald P. |editor1-first=David| editor1-last=Hitchcock |editor2-first=Bart| editor2-last=Verheij |title=Arguing on the Toulmin Model: New Essays in Argument Analysis and Evaluation |year=2006 |publisher=Springer Netherlands|pages=31–38|chapter=A Citation-Based Reflection on Toulmin and Argument |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=3xE5ichwr5MC&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;ots=gGspeEoAs-&amp;dq=A%20Citation-Based%20Reflection%20on%20Toulmin%20and%20Argument&amp;pg=PA31#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20Citation-Based%20Reflection%20on%20Toulmin%20and%20Argument&amp;f=false |isbn=978-1-4020-4937-8 |quote=Toulmin's 1958 work is essential in the field of argumentation |doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-4938-5_3 |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; What follows below is a sketch of his ideas.

====An alternative to absolutism and relativism====
Toulmin has argued that absolutism (represented by theoretical or analytic arguments) has limited practical value. Absolutism is derived from Plato's idealized formal logic, which advocates universal truth; thus absolutists believe that moral issues can be resolved by adhering to a standard set of moral principles, regardless of context. By contrast, Toulmin asserts that many of these so-called standard principles are irrelevant to real situations encountered by human beings in daily life.

To describe his vision of daily life, Toulmin introduced the concept of argument fields; in ''The Uses of Argument'' (1958), Toulmin states that some aspects of arguments vary from field to field, and are hence called "field-dependent", while other aspects of argument are the same throughout all fields, and are hence called "field-invariant". The flaw of absolutism, Toulmin believes, lies in its unawareness of the field-dependent aspect of argument; absolutism assumes that all aspects of argument are field invariant.

Toulmin's theories resolve to avoid the defects of absolutism without resorting to relativism: relativism, Toulmin asserted, provides no basis for distinguishing between a moral or immoral argument. In ''Human Understanding'' (1972), Toulmin suggests that anthropologists have been tempted to side with relativists because they have noticed the influence of cultural variations on rational arguments; in other words, the anthropologist or relativist overemphasizes the importance of the "field-dependent" aspect of arguments, and becomes unaware of the "field-invariant" elements. In an attempt to provide solutions to the problems of absolutism and relativism, Toulmin attempts throughout his work to develop standards that are neither absolutist nor relativist for assessing the worth of ideas.

Toulmin believes that a good argument can succeed in providing good justification to a claim, which will stand up to criticism and earn a favourable verdict.

====Components of argument====
In ''The Uses of Argument'' (1958), Toulmin proposed a layout containing [[Toulmin Model of Argument|six interrelated components for analyzing arguments]]:

#Claim: Conclusions whose merit must be established. For example, if a person tries to convince a listener that he is a British citizen, the claim would be "I am a British citizen." (1)
#Data: The facts we appeal to as a foundation for the claim. For example, the person introduced in 1 can support his claim with the supporting data "I was born in Bermuda." (2)
#Warrant: The statement authorizing our movement from the data to the claim. In order to move from the data established in 2, "I was born in Bermuda," to the claim in 1, "I am a British citizen," the person must supply a warrant to bridge the gap between 1 &amp; 2 with the statement "A man born in Bermuda will legally be a British Citizen." (3)
#Backing: Credentials designed to certify the statement expressed in the warrant; backing must be introduced when the warrant itself is not convincing enough to the readers or the listeners. For example, if the listener does not deem the warrant in 3 as credible, the speaker will supply the legal provisions as backing statement to show that it is true that "A man born in Bermuda will legally be a British Citizen."
#Rebuttal: Statements recognizing the restrictions to which the claim may legitimately be applied. The rebuttal is exemplified as follows, "A man born in Bermuda will legally be a British citizen, unless he has betrayed Britain and has become a spy of another country."
#Qualifier: Words or phrases expressing the speaker's degree of force or certainty concerning the claim. Such words or phrases include "possible," "probably," "impossible," "certainly," "presumably," "as far as the evidence goes," or "necessarily." The claim "I am definitely a British citizen" has a greater degree of force than the claim "I am a British citizen, presumably."

The first three elements "claim", "data", and "warrant" are considered as the essential components of practical arguments, while the second triad "qualifier", "backing", and "rebuttal" may not be needed in some arguments.

When first proposed, this layout of argumentation is based on legal arguments and intended to be used to analyze the rationality of arguments typically found in the courtroom; in fact, Toulmin did not realize that this layout would be applicable to the field of [[rhetoric]] and communication until his works were introduced to rhetoricians by Wayne Brockriede and Douglas Ehninger. Only after he published ''Introduction to Reasoning'' (1979) were the rhetorical applications of this layout mentioned in his works.

==== The evolution of knowledge ====
Toulmin's ''Human Understanding'' (1972) asserts that conceptual change is evolutionary. This book attacks Thomas Kuhn's explanation of conceptual change in ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''. Kuhn held that conceptual change is a revolutionary (as opposed to an evolutionary) process in which mutually exclusive paradigms compete to replace one another. Toulmin criticizes the relativist elements in Kuhn's thesis, as he points out that the mutually exclusive paradigms provide no ground for comparison; in other words, Kuhn's thesis has made the relativists' error of overemphasizing the "field variant" while ignoring the "field invariant", or commonality shared by all argumentation or scientific paradigms.

Toulmin proposes an evolutionary model of conceptual change comparable to Darwin's model of biological evolution. On this reasoning, conceptual change involves innovation and selection. Innovation accounts for the appearance of conceptual variations, while selection accounts for the survival and perpetuation of the soundest conceptions. Innovation occurs when the professionals of a particular discipline come to view things differently from their predecessors; selection subjects the innovative concepts to a process of debate and inquiry in what Toulmin considers as a "forum of competitions". The soundest concepts will survive the forum of competition as replacements or revisions of the traditional conceptions.

From the absolutists' point of view, concepts are either valid or invalid regardless of contexts; from a relativists' perspective, one concept is neither better nor worse than a rival concept from a different cultural context. From Toulmin's perspective, the evaluation depends on a process of comparison, which determines whether or not one concept will provide improvement to our explanatory power more so than its rival concepts.

====Rejection of certainty====
In ''Cosmopolis'' (1990), Toulmin traces the quest for certainty back to Descartes and Hobbes, and lauds Dewey, Wittgenstein, Heidegger and Rorty for abandoning that tradition.

===Pragma-dialectics===
{{Main article|Pragma-dialectics}}

Scholars at the [[University of Amsterdam]] in the Netherlands have pioneered a rigorous modern version of [[dialectic]]  under the name ''pragma-dialectics''. The intuitive idea is to formulate clearcut rules that, if followed, will yield rational discussion and sound conclusions. [[Frans H. van Eemeren]], the late [[Rob Grootendorst]], and many of their students have produced a large body of work expounding this idea.

The dialectical conception of reasonableness is given by ten rules for critical discussion, all being instrumental for achieving a resolution of the difference of opinion (from Van Eemeren, Grootendorst, &amp; Snoeck Henkemans, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;182-183). The theory postulates this as an ideal model, and not something one expects to find as an empirical fact. The model can however serve as an important heuristic and critical tool for testing how reality approximates this ideal and point to where discourse goes wrong, that is, when the rules are violated. Any such violation will constitute a [[fallacy]]. Albeit not primarily focused on fallacies, pragma-dialectics provides a systematic approach to deal with them in a coherent way.

===Walton's logical argumentation method===

[[Doug Walton]] developed a distinctive philosophical theory of logical argumentation built around a set of practical methods to help a user identify, analyze and evaluate arguments in everyday conversational discourse and in more structured areas such as debate, law and scientific fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walton|first1=Douglas|title=Methods of Argumentation|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are four main components: argumentation schemes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walton|first1=Douglas|last2=Reed|first2=Chris|last3=Macagno|first3=Fabrizio|title=Argumentation Schemes|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; dialogue structures, argument mapping tools, and formal argumentation systems. The method uses the notion of commitment in dialogue as the fundamental tool for the analysis and evaluation of argumentation rather than the notion of belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walton|first1=Douglas|last2=Krabbe|first2=E. C. W.|title=Commitment in Dialogue: Basic Concepts of Interpersonal Reasoning|date=1995|publisher=SUNY Press|location=Albany}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commitments are statements that the agent has expressed or formulated, and has pledged to carry out, or has publicly asserted. According to the commitment model, agents interact with each other in a dialogue in which each takes its turn to contribute speech acts. The dialogue framework uses critical questioning as a way of testing plausible explanations and finding weak points in an argument that raise doubt concerning the acceptability of the argument.

Walton's logical argumentation model takes a different view of proof and justification from that taken in the dominant epistemology in analytical philosophy, which is based on a [[justified true belief]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walton|first1=Douglas|last2=Zhang|first2=Nanning|title=The Epistemology of Scientific Evidence|journal=Artificial Intelligence and Law|date=2 October 2013|volume=21|issue=2|page=1|url=https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2335090|publisher=Social Science Research Network|language=en|quote=In  place of the traditional epistemological view of knowledge as justified true belief we argue that artificial  intelligence and law needs an evidence -based epistemology}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the logical argumentation approach, knowledge is seen as form of belief commitment firmly fixed by an argumentation procedure that tests the evidence on both sides, and use standards of proof to determine whether a proposition qualifies as knowledge. On this evidence-based approach, scientific knowledge must be seen as defeasible.

== Artificial intelligence ==
{{See also|Argument mapping|Argumentation framework}}
Efforts have been made within the field of [[artificial intelligence]] to perform and analyze the act of argumentation with computers.  Argumentation has been used to provide a proof-theoretic semantics for [[non-monotonic logic]], starting with the influential work of Dung (1995). Computational argumentation systems have found particular application in domains where formal logic and classical decision theory are unable to capture the richness of reasoning, domains such as law and medicine. In ''Elements of Argumentation'', Philippe Besnard and Anthony Hunter show how classical logic-based techniques can be used to capture key elements of practical argumentation.&lt;ref&gt;P. Besnard &amp; A. Hunter, "Elements of Argumentation." MIT Press, 2008.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9201">'''Arthur Versluis''' (born 1959) is a professor and Department Chair of Religious Studies in the College of Arts &amp; Letters at Michigan State University.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.religiousstudies.msu.edu/index.php/faculty/ Michigan State University, Religious Studues Faculty]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://arthurversluis.com/?page_id=29 arthurversluis.com, ''About'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Versluis did his Ph.D research at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. His thesis ''Ex oriente lux: American Transcendentalism and the Orient'' (1990)&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/104316 Arthur Versluis, ''''Ex oriente lux'']&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1993 as ''American Transcendentalism and Asian Religions''.&lt;ref group=web name="MSU"&gt;[http://www.religiousstudies.msu.edu/index.php/faculty/arthur-versluis/ Michigan State University, ''Arthus Versluis'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research topics==
Versluis' research focuses on [[western esotericism]] and [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], with a special interest in the influence of [[Platonism]] on western mysticism and American [[Transcendentalism]].&lt;ref group=web name="AV-7Q"&gt;[https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/sacredmatters/2015/01/12/seven-questions-for-arthur-versluis/ ''American Gurus: Seven Questions for Arthur Versluis''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417164207/https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/sacredmatters/2015/01/12/seven-questions-for-arthur-versluis/ |date=April 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcendentalism and American esotericism===
{{See also|Neo-Advaita|Subitism}}

Versluis has published a "trilogy" on American Transcendentalism and the development of western esotericism, namely ''American Transcendentalism and Asian Religions'' (1993), ''The Esoteric Origins of the American Renaissance'' (2001), and ''American Gurus: From Transcendentalism to New Age Religion'' (2014). In these publications, he describes the development of American Transcendentalism and its influence on western esotericism, including the contemporary phenomenon of "immediatist gurus", who promise instant enlightenment.&lt;ref group=web name="AV-7Q" /&gt;

In ''American Transcendentalism and Asian Religions'', Versluis describes the influence of Asian religions on European Romanticism and on American Transcendentalism.{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p=3}} In the early 19th century, these Asian religions were introduced to the western culture, and texts like the [[Bhagavad Gita]] and the [[Upanishads]] had a great impact on the Transcendental movement, and influential members like [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]] and [[Thoreau]].{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p=3}} But Transcendentalism was also influenced by [[western esotericism]], a topic which until recently received little attention in the academia.{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p=3}}{{refn|group=note|See also Elizabeth De Michelis (2005), ''A History of Modern Yoga'', for this neglected influence on the development of a global spirituality.}}

In ''The Esoteric Origins of the American Renaissance'' Versluis investigates the influence of western esotericism on the mid-19th [[American Renaissance]]. Versluis regards his ''The Esoteric Origins'' as a pioneering study in this discipline.{{sfn|Versluis|2001|p=3}}

In ''American Gurus: From Transcendentalism to New Age Religion'', Versluis describes the emergence of immediatist gurus: gurus who are not connected to any of the traditional religions, and promise instant enlightenment and liberation.{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=1,2}} These include [[Eckhart Tolle]], [[Ram Dass]], [[Adi Da]], and [[Andrew Cohen (spiritual teacher)|Andrew Cohen]].{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=1}} "Immediatism" refers to "a religious assertion of spontaneous, direct, unmediated spiritual insight into reality (typically with little or no prior training), which some term [[Enlightenment (spirituality)|"enlightenment"]]."{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=2}} According to Versluis, immediatism is typical for Americans, who want "the fruit of religion, but not its obligations."&lt;ref group=web name="AV-7Q" /&gt; Although immediatism has its roots in European culture and history{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=2}} as far back as [[Platonism]],{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=3}} and also includes [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialism]],{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=4}} Versluis points to [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] as its key ancestor,{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=2}} who "emphasized the possibility of immediate, direct spiritual knowledge and power."{{sfn|Versluis|2014|p=3}}

===Christian Theosophy===
Another "trilogy" deals with [[Christian theosophy]], and includes ''Theosophia'' (1994), ''Wisdom’s Children: A Christian Esoteric Tradition'' (1999), and ''Wisdom’s Book: The Sophia Anthology'' (2000).&lt;ref group=web name="MSU" /&gt;

==Journals and associations==
Versluis is an editor of the ''Journal for the Study of Radicalism'', and founding editor of ''Esoterica'', which started as a journal, and is now a biannual print book series, ''Studies in Esotericism''.&lt;ref group=web name="MSU" /&gt; Versluis is also the founding president of the ''Association for the Study of Esotericism''.&lt;ref group=web name="MSU" /&gt;

'''Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications''' ({{zh|s=重庆邮电大学 |t=重慶郵電大學}}; abbreviation: '''CQUPT''') is a public university in China's fourth municipality: [[Chongqing]]. It focuses on the research and education in the field of information and communications and enjoys a nationwide reputation in the study of posts, telecommunications and information technology, especially for its research and commercialization in 3G mobile technologies, optical sciences and related digital research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techtriangle.com/thetriangle_march2011_feature Comments on CQUPT by CEO of Canada's Technology Triangle Inc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928210543/http://www.techtriangle.com/thetriangle_march2011_feature |date=2011-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the four universities of Posts and Telecommunications in China and the only one of its kind in the Southwest China. It enjoys a very good reputation in the ICT industry in China due to its high quality education and research and the large number of alumni working in the ICT industry. Due to its achievements and contributions in the field of Information and Communications, especially in the development of China's own digital communications systems, CQUPT is considered as the cradle of China's digital communications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqupt.edu.cn/xxgk/xxjj.php Introduction of CQUPT on its website, paragraph 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

CQUPT was founded in 1950 along with the foundation of the People's Republic of China and the communist takeover of Chongqing. It was initially founded in the name of Chongqing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications. In 1965, it was entitled to have postgraduate programs as one of the first 10 colleges that had the right to have such programs in the then Sichuan Province (Chongqing separated from Sichuan Province as a Municipality in 1997).

In 2000, under the university system reform in China, the university became co-governed and co-financed by the Chinese Central Government with the Chongqing government. In 2006, CQUPT contracted with MIIT (Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China) to become one of the universities supported by Ministry and Province (Municipalities) government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqupt.edu.cn/xxgk/lsyg.php History of CQUPT]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Schools==
CQUPT has 15 schools and institutes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqupt.edu.cn/english/index.php Schools in CQUPT]&lt;/ref&gt; with  the Chongqing International Institute of Semiconductor established in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deptweb.cqupt.edu.cn/xwzx/news.php?id=8876 Press release on the establishment of Chongqing International Institute of Semiconductor]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

===Overview===

CQUPT is the origin of the China's digital communications systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqupt.edu.cn/english/index.php Brief introduction to CQUPT's research on its website]&lt;/ref&gt; In the very recent years, over 600 scientific projects in the ICT field have been done in the university and 80 of them were granted the "Scientific Research Achievement Awards" by the government. CQUPT is the only Chinese university participating in the development of China's own 3G standard: TD-SCDMA.

The world's first TD-SCDMA chip and mobile phone were developed at CQUPT. The university played a key role in the establishment of China's first national "EPA Communication Standard for Industrial Measurement and Control System", which was recognized by the IEC as international standard in the field of industrial automation. The university's spin-off company [https://web.archive.org/web/20120326025835/http://www.cqcyit.com.cn/en/ Chongqing CYIT Communications Technologies Company (CYIT)] is among the first companies doing research on TD-SCDMA and TD-LTE in China and is already a frontrunner in the field nowadays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqcyit.com.cn CYIT's website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315181614/http://www.cqcyit.com.cn/ |date=2012-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university's strength also lies in areas such as computer science, automatic control technology, microtechnologies, and others, as one of the first academic institutions doing research in these fields in China.

Research at CQUPT is done in about 30 research platforms. Each of the research platforms may contain several laboratories or research groups. Research at CQUPT is closely linked to the industry. In 2010, the Chongqing International Institute of Semiconductor, which is in and hosted by CQUPT, was founded with the participating of nearly 50 partners in industry from around the world, including Qualcomm in USA, Eplida in Japan, the International Association of Semiconductor Equipment and Materials European Microelectronics Center in Taiwan among others. The research at CQUPT is widely done in cooperation with other academic or industrial partners in the form of joint research centers or laboratory.

Academic institutions which have founded joint research centers with CQUPT include the Chinese Science Academy (CSA), the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, Essex University in UK, Inha University in South Korea, etc. The university's industrial partners, which have founded joint research centers or laboratories include Oracle, Cisco, Lenovo Mobile, Maipu Communications, and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqupt.edu.cn/xxgk/xxjj.php Introduction to CQUPT on its website, paragraph 7]&lt;/ref&gt;

The university boasts 11 Key Disciplines of ministry and provincial level, and 16 key laboratories, engineering research centres and humanities &amp; social science bases.

==Students and alumni==

Over the 60 years since the establishment of university in 1950, CQUPT has educated over 70,000 students in the field of Information and Communication, many of whom are in the high positions of China's telecommunications companies. The university is deemed as the cradle of talents of ICT industry in China. It boasts its high employment rate among Chinese universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cqupt.edu.cn/xxgk/xxjj.php Introduction to CQUPT, paragraphs 4 &amp; 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the university is featured with excellence in the area of Information and Communications, it is striving to offer a wide range of other subjects including science, engineering, economics, management, arts and education, most of which are related to applied science and engineering. The university offers 45 undergraduate programs, 37 postgraduate programs and Master of Engineering programs; it was also authorized to confer doctor’s degrees in the disciplines of Information and Communication Engineering, Computer Science and Technology, Electronic Science and Technology, Control Science and Engineering, Management and Engineering.

CQUPT has about 20,000 students, including more than 3,000 postgraduates.

==Partnerships==

CQUPT has established good cooperative relations and links with over 30 prestigious universities in USA, Russia, UK, Italy, Canada, Korea, Singapore and so forth.

Some examples of joint research centers co-founded with other academic institutions out of China include the Joint Research Center of 4G Mobile Communications co-founded with Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore, the Sino-Korean Institute of Spatial Information Systems founded with Inha University and Seowon University in South Korea, the Sino-Europe Joint Laboratory for Intelligent Systems and Robotics with the Essex University and Open University in UK.

Research at CQUPT is also widely collaborated with famous companies in the industry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8683">'''Computational social science''' refers to the academic sub-disciplines concerned with computational approaches to the [[social science]]s. This means that computers are used to model, simulate, and analyze social phenomena.  Fields include [[computational economics]], [[computational sociology]], [[cliodynamics]], [[culturomics]],  and the automated analysis of contents, in social and traditional media. It focuses on investigating social and behavioral relationships and interactions through [[social simulation]], modeling, network analysis, and media analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://computationalsocialscience.org/|title=The Computational Social Science Society of the Americas official website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
There are two terminologies that relate to each other: '''Social Science Computing (SSC) and Computational Social Science (CSS)'''. In literature, CSS is referred to the field of social science that uses the computational approaches in studying the social phenomena.
On the other hand, SSC is the field in which computational methodologies are created to assist in explanations of social phenomena.

Computational social science revolutionizes both fundamental legs of the [[scientific method]]: [[empirical research]], especially through [[big data]], by analyzing the [[digital footprint]] left behind through social online activities; and [[scientific theory]], especially through [[computer simulation]] model building through [[social simulation]].&lt;ref&gt;DT&amp;SC 7-1: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9x3d75ZMuYU .

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18510">The '''conservation and restoration of lighthouses''' is the process by which lighthouse structures are preserved through detailed examination, cleaning, and in-kind replacement of materials.  Given the wide variety of materials used to construct lighthouses, a variety of techniques and considerations are required.

[[Lighthouses]] alert sea goers of rocky shores nearby as well as to provide landmark navigation.  Lighthouses also act as a physical representation to maritime history and advancement.  These historic buildings are prone to deterioration due to their location on rocky outcrops of land near the water, as well as severe weather events, and the continued rise of sea levels.  Given these conditions preservation and conservation efforts have increased.

==Exterior==

===Ground===

The ground consists of the land, outbuildings, and landscape that the lighthouse property sits on.  The grounds may also include buildings from other time periods as part of the cultural landscape.  The types of buildings, their relationship to one another, their location over the whole of the property, types of flora and their location, and potential archaeological sites (if they have been identified), are all aspects that are related to the lighthouse and its history and should be considered during conservation of the property.

Outbuildings are prone to deterioration because they were often used for storage and were not maintained to the same standards as the lighthouse.  Former repairs to buildings may have used inexpensive materials as a temporary fix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IALA Lighthouse Conservation Manual|url=https://americanlighthousecouncil.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/lighthouse_conservatiion_manual_ed_1_may_2006.pdf|website=International Association of Lighthouse Authorities}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These materials often degrade making the building unstable.  Any buildings that remain intact and in their original location are historically important to the relationship and usage of the lighthouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Secretary of the Interior's Standards and Guidelines|title=Treatment of Historic Properties, 1995|url=https://www.nps.gov/history/local-law/arch_stnds_8_2.htm|website=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Materials, colors, and details are all representative of the lighthouse when it was active and are often considered during the preservation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Historic Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook.pdf|website=United States Lighthouse Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coatings===

====Paint====

Lighthouse exterior paint was often used in colorful patterns to act as a day marker.  Paint was also used to help protect the exterior structure of the lighthouse from wear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Historic Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook.pdf|website=United States Lighthouse Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Evidence of paint degradation include crazing, cracking, peeling between coats, blistering, and wrinkling.  Repair can be made through spot treatments or through a complete replacement of the paint.
Original paint was made of lead and tended to withstand harsh conditions while still protecting the structure.  The required use of National Historic Preservation approved paints has proved difficult as they do not work well with the lighthouse structure's original materials &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Piedras Blancas Lighthouse Preservation Expertise|url=https://americanlighthousecouncil.org/2014/10/04/piedras-blancas-lighthouse-seeking-preservation-expertise/#comments|website=American Lighthouse Council}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, salt in the air can lead to severe chalking of the paint surface and cause premature failure of latex paint products.  Most repainting projects will have to begin with removal of the original base coat, followed by a thorough surface cleaning to remove impurities, then ended with a complete repainting of the structure.  Paint normally only lasts between five and eight years, depending on the lighthouse and conditions.

====Stucco====

[[Stucco]] has been traditionally used as a protective barrier on the exterior of lighthouses.  Stucco is made up of fine granular particles mixed together with a binder.  The composition of stucco has changed significantly over the years and may require laboratory analysis to determine the makeup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Historic Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook.pdf|website=United States Lighthouse Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the problems with stucco arise from prolonged contact with water or moisture which breaks down the structure of the particles and binder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Preservation Briefs|title=The Preservation and Repair of Historic Stucco|url=https://www.nps.gov/tps/how-to-preserve/briefs/22-stucco.htm|website=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the texture of stucco is prone to removal when abraded.  As with most preservation, gentle cleaning of the surface can help remove dirt and impurities and inhibit further deterioration.

===Iron===

Iron was a popular material used in lighthouse construction.  Multiple types of iron were used including: [[cast iron]], [[wrought iron]], [[steel]], [[galvanized iron]], [[galvanized steel]], and [[stainless steel]].  Cast iron was the most popular material because it resists corrosion and can be cast into a multitude of shapes.  Though iron is sturdy it can be prone to deterioration through corrosion (oxidation, glavanic corrosion, and graphitization), weathering, and flaws from the manufacturing process.  Degradation of iron is visible through pitting, cracks, erosion, rust, blistering, flaking, and scaling.

Preservation and restoration of iron should be completed using the least invasive approach possible.  Iron is strong but can be easily damaged through improper or harsh procedures. "Many of the maintenance and repair techniques... particularly those relating to cleaning and painting, are potentially dangerous and should be carried out only by experienced and qualified workmen using protective equipment suitable to the task. It may be necessary to involve a USCG engineer or architect, preservation architect, or building conservator familiar with lighthouse preservation to assess the condition of the iron and prepare contract documents for its treatment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Historic Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://www.nps.gov/maritime/nhlpa/handbook/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook_07_Part4Masonry1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Masonry===

The [[masonry]] component of a lighthouse is made up of the bricks and stones on the exterior.  Damage to masonry is primarily caused by water, salt accumulation, expansion and contraction, abrasion, poor ventilation, and inappropriate cleaning techniques (ex. sandblasting).  Masonry may show many signs of deterioration  to include: bulges, cracks, efflorescence, erosion, flaking, sloping or uneven settlement, mold or mildew, missing stones or bricks, condensation buildup, and blistering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Historic Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://www.nps.gov/maritime/nhlpa/handbook/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook_07_Part4Masonry1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cleaning of Masonry====
Basic preservation of lighthouse masonry usually includes gentle surface cleaning.  Appropriate methods for cleaning are determined by the type of masonry that exists on the building.  Some cleaning methods include water, chemical, and laser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Preservation Briefs|title=Assessing Cleaning and Water-Repellent Treatments|url=https://www.nps.gov/tps/how-to-preserve/briefs/1-cleaning-water-repellent.htm|website=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are multiple water cleaning methods.  Soaking is a process where the masonry undergoes a prolonged exposure to misting water to remove dirt.  Water washing uses a light to medium pressurized stream of water.  Some water washing may use the addition of detergents to increase dirt removal.  Chemical cleaning is also an option, but may be too harsh depending on the makeup of the masonry.  Chemical cleaners are either acidic or alkaline.  Laser cleaning is effective, mostly on smaller areas of masonry, but can be costly.  Occasionally, a lighthouse may be weatherproofed through covering the masonry with paint, stucco, or whitewash/lime mortar wash; but only if these are historically accurate for the structure.  Due to the differences in materials and construction techniques, only an experienced architectural conservator should be contacted for conservation or restoration work.

===Wood===

Wood was either used for construction on the exterior or in combination with masonry and/or iron to build components of the lighthouse (ex. stairs).  The largest cause for deterioration of wood in lighthouses is from exposure to moisture.  This exposure is normally the result of direct and prolonged exposure to damp conditions.  Other causes for deterioration include pests, fungus, and insects.  Some signs of decomposition include cracking, bulging, holes, peeling paint, leaning of the structure, gaps between joints, and exposed bare wood.

Some complications from wood deterioration can be solved through tight fitting seals around windows and doors, gutter systems, caulking of seams and joints, and sloping away of decking from the structure.  Regular cleaning of the surface may also help reduce accumulated residues on the wood thereby prolonging its usable life.  The most common treatment for replacing degraded wood is to use a splicing technique where new pieces of wood are joined with original wood features.  For severe cases, large in-kind replacements may be necessary.

==Interior==
Most lighthouse interiors were simple in construction and decoration, unless used as part of the light keeper's residence.  A majority of the issues related to lighthouse interiors stem from moisture, condensation, neglect, or inappropriate treatments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://www.nps.gov/maritime/nhlpa/handbook/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook_18_Part4Interiors.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Addressing issues on the exterior is required first in order to protect the inside of the structure.  Proper ventilation of the structure should be considered.  The season and geographical location of the lighthouse will determine what type and how often air exchanges should take place within the lighthouse.  According to the National Park Service "the absolute minimum air exchange for most mothballed lighthouses consists of one to four air exchanges every hour; one or two air exchanges per hour in winter and often twice that amount in summer."&lt;ref name="name"&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://www.nps.gov/maritime/nhlpa/handbook/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook_18_Part4Interiors.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lantern===
The lantern is the large round glass structure, that houses the lens, located at the top of the lighthouse.  This structure is made out of multiple materials, primarily glass, wood, and iron.

Any conservation or restoration processes should keep in mind that the lantern, ventilation shafts, and lens should not be obstructed in anyway.  Any replacement glass must be rated for wind standards that are likely to occur at the top of the lighthouse.

[[File:Kilauea Fresnel Lens.jpg|thumb|Lantern with a lens inside]]

====Lens====

The [[Fresnel lens]] was introduced for use in lighthouses around 1823. Generally, keeping the lens historically preserved, rather than restoration to period, will reduce stress on the lens and keep some of the lens's story intact (e.g. chips of the glass that are documented in historical light keeper's notes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Byrne|first1=Greg|title=The Conservation of the Classical Lighthouse Lens|url=http://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/Lens%20Conservation.pdf|website=United States Lighthouse Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to consult a conservator before attempting any conservation on a lens.  The glass that was used to make the lens is often brittle and may chip easily.  Lens glass etches easily from contact with oils or dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Commandant Instruction 16500.9|title=Classical Lens Maintenance|url=http://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/USCG%20Lens%20Directives.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To secure the prisms of the lens a compound of calcium carbonate, lead, and linseed oil, called [[litharge]], was used.  If deterioration of the litharge is found, it is likely that the prisms are not properly secured within the frame structure of the lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Historic Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook.pdf|website=United States Lighthouse Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the litharge is white in color (lead carbonate) the material is mostly non-porous and may not easily be preserved, meaning that full litharge replacement might be necessary.  If the litharge present is orange-red in color (lead-oxide), this substance tends to be more porous and may allow for stabilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Historic Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook.pdf|website=United States Lighthouse Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the lens was "floated in a trough of mercury"; though this practice has been abandoned, mercury contamination may still exist in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Commandant Instruction 16500.9|title=Classical Lens Maintenance|url=http://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/USCG%20Lens%20Directives.pdf|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Cleaning a lens=====
Documentation of the prism normally begins with labeling all issues starting from the center prism, listed as number one, and then working outward sequentially. Identification should indicate whether it is an upper or lower prism.  Prisms are checked for firm seating by gently tapping on the ''outside'' of the glass only.  If there is any movement of the glass, conservators are normally called before any work is continued.  If the glass is stable, the prisms will then be checked for particulate matter.  If fine or non-abrasive particles are observed, a soft cotton cloth lightly wetted with distilled water may be used to gently clean the surface.  It is also possible to use denatured alcohol mixed with water to clean the glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Historic Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook.pdf|website=United States Lighthouse Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The solution will vary from lens to lens as each has a different glass composition.  A conservator should be called in if any clouding of the glass is found as this is a sign of glass deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=National Park Service|title=Historic Lighthouse Preservation Handbook|url=https://uslhs.org/sites/default/files/attached-files/HistoricLighthousePreservationHandbook.pdf|website=United States Lighthouse Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, a routine polishing of the brass that secures the lenses would take place.  In preventive conservation, the task of brass polishing should not take place as it encourages loss of original material.  The patina that develops over time also helps create a protective barrier around the brass.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Disaster planning==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2016}}Lighthouses are inherently prone to disasters due to their location. A disaster plan can help mitigate some of the issues that occur during a disaster situation. Most disasters are water related but fires, earthquakes, and especially erosion can also be causes. The disaster plan should be tailored to the disaster most likely to affect the lighthouse's location; however, it should take into regard multiple types of disasters. The lighthouse property and objects located within it should be thoroughly documented. Furthermore, complete photograph documentation of the property and collection can help with insurance claims and restoration.  There should be a copy of these documents located at the lighthouse as well as a secondary location in case they may not be accessible at the lighthouse due to a disaster.  Coordination with local authorities, like the police and fire department, may help during an emergency situation. Ideally, files should both be digitized and on paper.

===Moving a lighthouse===
Strong winds and waves cause land erosion around lighthouses. Over extended periods of time, the promontories that lighthouses are normally built on can be eroded to the point where the safety of the lighthouse is impacted. In extreme cases, the lighthouse might need to be relocated to a new plot of land in order to preserve the structure. There are four major lighthouse moves that have taken place in the United States: [[Block Island Southeast Light]]house, [[Cape Hatteras Light]]house, [[Sankaty Head Light]]house, and [[Gay Head Light]]house.

'''Critical medical anthropology''' ('''CMA''') is a branch of [[medical anthropology]] that blends [[critical theory]] and ground-level ethnographic approaches in the consideration of the [[political economy]] of health, and the effect of social inequality on people's health. It puts emphasis on the structure of social relationships, rather than purely [[biomedical]] factors in analyzing health and accounting for its determinants.

CMA starts with the idea that human health is a biosocial and political ecological product. Consequently, CMA is critical of the tendency to naturalize the process of health and illness in the health and social sciences. CMA dates to the 1980s, but has deeper roots in critical theory concerning the social determinants of health. CMA adds an anthropological dimension to traditional critical approaches, thereby avoiding a top-down perspective. In other words, CMA recognizes that there is interaction between the macro-level of social structure, the meso-level of social organization and agentive action, and the micro-level of individual experience and health.

During the early years of medical anthropology’s formation, explanations within the discipline tended to be narrowly focused on explaining health-related beliefs and behaviors at the local level in terms of specific ecological conditions, cultural configurations, or psychological factors. While providing needed insight about the nature and function of traditional and folk medical models, the initial perspectives in medical anthropology tended to ignore the wider causes and determinants of human decision making and behavior. Explanations that are limited to accounting for health-related issues in terms of the influence of human personalities, culturally constituted motivations and understandings, or even local ecological relationships, emergent critical medical anthropologists began to argue, are inadequate because they tend not to include examination of the structures of social relationship that unite (commonly in an unequal fashion) and influence far-flung individuals, communities, and even whole nations. A critical understanding, by contrast, involves paying close attention to what has been called the “vertical links” that connect the social group of interest to the larger regional, national, and global human society and to the configuration of social relationships that contribute to the patterning of human behavior, belief, attitude, and emotion.

Consequently, what came to be called critical medical anthropology focused attention on understanding the origins of dominant cultural constructions in health, including which social class, gender, or ethnic group’s interests particular health concepts express and under what set of historic conditions they arise. Further, CMA emphasizes structures of power and inequality in health care systems and the contributions of health ideas and practices in reinforcing inequalities in the wider society. Moreover, CMA addresses the social origins of illness, such as the way in which poverty, discrimination, industrial pollution of the environment, social violence, and fear of violence contribute to poor health. Critical medical anthropologists argue that experience and “agency,” that is, individual and group decision making and action, are constructed and reconstructed in the action arena between socially constituted categories of meaning and the political-economic forces that shape the context [and texture] of daily life. In other words, people develop their own individual and collective understandings and responses to illness and to other threats to their well-being, but they do so in a world that is not of their own making, a world in which inequality of access to health care, the media, productive resources (e.g., land, potable water, clean air), and valued social statuses play a significant role in their daily options. 

Additionally, while recognizing the fundamental importance of physical (including biological) reality in health, such as the nature of particular pathogens or the release of toxins into the environment, CMA emphasizes the fact that it is not merely the idea of “nature”—the way external reality is conceived and related to by humans—but also the very physical shape of nature, including human biology, that has been deeply influenced by an evolutionary history of social inequality, overt and covert social conflict, and the operation of both physical power and the power to shape dominant ideas and conceptions in society and internationally through processes of globalization, control of production and reproduction, and control of labor.

'''Cross-battery assessment''' refers to the process by which [[psychologist]]s use information from multiple test batteries (i.e., various [[IQ test]]s) to help guide diagnostic decisions and to gain a fuller picture of an individual’s [[Cognitive ability|cognitive abilities]] than can be ascertained through the use of single-battery assessments. The cross-battery approach (XBA) was first introduced in the late 1990s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= McGrew|first1= D. P. &amp; , K. S|editor1-first= Dawn P.|editor1-last= Flanagan|editor2-first= Patti L.|editor2-last= Harrison|others= |title= Contemporary intellectual assessment: Theories, tests, and issues|year= 1997|publisher= The Guilford Press|location= New York|isbn= 978-1-59385-125-5 |pages= 314–325|chapter= A cross-battery to assessing and interpreting cognitive abilities: Narrowing the gap between practice and cognitive science}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Dawn Flanagan, Samuel Ortiz and Kevin McGrew. It offers practitioners the means to make systematic, valid and up-to-date interpretations of intelligence batteries and to augment them with other tests in a way that is consistent with the empirically supported [[CHC Theory|Cattell–Horn–Carroll (CHC) theory]] of cognitive abilities.&lt;ref name="Flanagan"&gt;Flanagan, D. P., Ortiz, S. O., &amp; Alfonso, V. C. (2007). Essentials of Cross Battery Assessment 2nd Edition. New Jersey: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt;

==Three Foundational Sources of Information==
The XBA approach is a time efficient method to reliably measure a wider (or more in-depth but selective range) of cognitive abilities/processes than any single intelligence battery can measure.  It is based on three foundational sources of information (i.e., practice, research and test development) that provide the knowledge necessary to organise theory-driven, comprehensive, reliable, and valid assessments of cognitive abilities.&lt;ref name="Flanagan"/&gt;

=== Practice ===
[[R. W. Woodcock]] conducted a joint [[factor analysis]] suggesting the necessity of cross-battery assessments to measure a broad range of cognitive abilities rather than a single intellectual battery.&lt;ref name="Flanagan"/&gt;  For instance, he found that of the major intellectual batteries utilized prior to 2000, most failed to measure three or more broad CHC abilities that were considered essential in understanding and predicting school achievement. This provided the impetus for developing the XBA approach. 
The XBA approach also helps facilitate communication among professionals, which guards against misinterpretation.  The XBA approach offers practitioners a psychometrically defensible way of identifying [[normative]] strengths and weaknesses in cognitive abilities.&lt;ref name="Flanagan"/&gt;

=== Research ===
The XBA approach helped to promote a greater understanding between cognitive abilities and important outcome criteria. Furthermore, improving the validity of CHC ability measures will further elucidate the relations between CHC cognitive abilities and different outcomes, such as achievement and occupational outcomes.&lt;ref name="Flanagan"/&gt;

=== Test Development ===
Test authors have utilized CHC theory and XBA CHC test classifications as a blueprint for test development ([[Woodcock–Johnson Tests of Cognitive Abilities|WJ III]], [[Stanford–Binet Intelligence Scales|SB5]], [[Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children|KABC-II]], and [[Differential Ability Scales|DAS-II]] etc.).  Despite the fact that cognitive abilities tests demonstrate a greater coverage of CHC broad cognitive abilities now as compared to previous years; there is still a need to use XBA approach for assessment.&lt;ref name="Flanagan"/&gt;

== Application of the XBA Approach ==
It is recommended that practitioners adhere to several guiding principles in order to ensure that XBA procedures are [[psychometric]]ally and theoretically sound.&lt;ref name="Flanagan"/&gt;  First, one should select an intelligence battery that best addresses referral concerns.  Second, subtests and clusters or composites from a single battery should be utilized whenever possible in order to best represent the broad CHC abilities (i.e., use actual norms whenever possible).  Third, it is important  to construct CHC broad and narrow ability clusters through acceptable methods, such as CHC theory driven factor analyses or expert consensus content-validity studies.&lt;ref name="Flanagan"/&gt;  Fourth, when two or more qualitatively different indicators of a broad abilities of interest are not assessed or available on the core battery, then one may supplement it for broad ability indicators from another battery.  Finally, when crossing batteries, select tests that were developed and normed within a few years of one another.  Sixth, in order to minimize the effect of spurious differences between test scores, select tests from the smallest number of batteries.&lt;ref name="Flanagan"/&gt;
Underlining the importance of the above points of consideration is the fact that the overzealous attitude of few psychologists to use this XBA approach has led to several cases of its abuse resulting in wrong and misguiding results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=wiki-centric|title=Hits and Myths of XBA|journal=Education Faculty Publications and Presentations|date=11 January 2009|url=http://scholarworks.uttyler.edu/education_fac/5/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation of the XBA Approach Step-by-Step &lt;ref name="Flanagan"/&gt; ==
#Select primary intelligence battery for assessment
#Identify represented CHC abilities
#Select tests to measure CHC abilities not measured by the primary battery
#Administer the primary battery (and any other supplemental tests) 
#Enter data into the XBA DMIA (provided in "Essentials of Cross Battery Assessment: Second Edition"&lt;ref name="Flanagan"/&gt;
#Follow XBA guidelines

== Use of XBA in Specific Learning Disability (SLD) Evaluation ==

=== The "Seven Deadly Sins" in SLD Evaluation ===
{{multiple issues|section=y|
{{off-topic|date=March 2013}}
{{unclear|section|date=March 2013}}
}}
[[Specific learning disability]] (SLD) is the largest disability identified among school-aged children. According to Flanagan,  Ortiz and Alfonso,&lt;ref name="Flanagan"/&gt; in order to receive a diagnosis of SLD the following criteria must be met following these steps: a deficit in academic functioning is determined, academic difficulties are not due to secondary exclusionary factors (e.g., neurological issues, etc.), a deficit in cognitive ability is determined, exclusionary factors are reviewed again to determine that the academic and cognitive deficits are not due to secondary factors, [[underachievement]] is established, the academic deficits are shown to have a negative effect on daily life. Flanagan, Ortiz and Alfonso &lt;ref name="Flanagan"/&gt; suggest "seven deadly sins" as a metaphor for understanding the misconceptions surrounding SLD evaluation that continue to undermine its reliability and validity.

====1. Relentless searching for ipsative or intra-individual discrepancies====
One of the most common practices in SLD evaluations is when the scores are [[Ipsative|ipsatized]].  Ipsatized scores are scores that have been averaged and subtracted from the overall average in order to determine the degree of [[Deviation (statistics)|deviation]] from the average.  This suggests that when scores deviate from the mean they are clinically important indicators of either relative weaknesses (lower) or relative strengths (higher).  Thus, weaknesses are thought of as evidence of SLD. This approach only focuses on the identification of discrepancies that exist within the individual. The vast majority of people do not have flat cognitive profiles and instead show significant variability in their profile of cognitive ability scores. The assumption that people who have certain scores in one domain will show similar ability in all domains is erroneous. Instead of looking for discrepancies wherever they might be found, theory should guide comparison between different sub-tests.&lt;ref name="Flanagan"/&gt;

====2. Failure to distinguish between a relative weakness and a normative weakness====
A lower score does not automatically gain clinical significance simply because the discrepancy has been determined to be real (statistically significant).  Statistical significance only means that the difference between the two scores is not due to chance (i.e., that they are different from one another), that is, it does not mean that the difference between the two scores in the comparison is clinically meaningful or indicative of impairment.

====3. Obsession with the severe discrepancy calculation====
The ability-achievement discrepancy has been regarded as important to definitions and diagnostic criteria of SLD that practitioners often resort to calculating every sub-test score obtained at an evaluation.  Given the high number of discrepancies available to calculate, it would be surprising if at least one significant discrepancy was not found. The significant ability-achievement discrepancy should not be synonymous with nor a necessary condition for a SLD diagnosis.

====4. Belief that IQ is a near perfect predictor of potential====
This ability-achievement discrepancy was likely fostered by the notion that IQ and other global ability composites are near-perfect predictors of an individual's academic achievement.  For instance, scores of general ability, like the [[FSIQ]], only account for about 35 to 50% of total achievement variance, which leaves about 50 to 65% of the variance unexplained. Thus, practitioners must recognize that there are other important factors that explain significant variance in achievement and global ability.

====5. Failure to apply current theory and research====
In evaluating SLD, practitioners may not always be privy to or able to implement procedures that are based on modern theory and research. Practitioners often omit contemporary psychometric theory and current research on SLD that aid in determining identification and diagnosis of SLD.

====6. Over-reliance on findings from a single sub-test====
Diagnostic decisions are often based on the results from either a single sub-test score or scores used to screen individuals. The reliance on these single scores may not be suitable for the purpose of diagnosis or high-stakes decision making. For instance, one of the fundamental properties of psychometrics is that a single sub-test can't be considered a reliable indicator by itself of the construct it is intended to measure. One sub-test is not sufficient to indicate the presence of an SLD or other impairment.

====7. Belief that aptitude and ability are the same====
Aptitude and ability are two concepts that are often mistakenly confused. It is important to differentiate between the two given the shift in understanding SLD which is based on the difference between ability and aptitude. When evaluating SLD, looking at aptitude is important because those abilities are associated with long-term academic outcomes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4928">In the [[philosophy of technology]], the '''device paradigm''' is the way "[[Technology|technological]] [[tool|device]]s" are perceived and consumed in modern society, according to [[Albert Borgmann]]. It explains the intimate relationship between people, things and technological devices, defining most economic relations and also shapes [[social]] and [[moral]] relations in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Moral Fragments and Moral Community: A Proposal for Church in Society|last=Rasmussen|first=Larry|publisher=Fortress Press|year=1993|isbn=0800627571|location=Minneapolis|pages=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the device paradigm is a critical response to the [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]]'s notion of [[Gestell]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Lovitt]], introduction to Heidegger's ''The Question Concerning Technology''&lt;/ref&gt; It has been widely endorsed by philosophers of technology, including [[Hubert Dreyfus]], [[Andrew Feenberg]], and [[Eric Higgs (philosopher)|Eric Higgs]], as well as environmental philosopher [[David Strong]].

== Devices ==

For Borgmann, a '''device''' is a thing that is used as a means to an end. Therefore, a device is seen as "the compound of commodity and machinery" while "the distinctive pattern of division and connection of its components is the device paradigm."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Power Failure: Christianity in the Culture of Technology|last=Borgmann|first=Albert|publisher=Brazos Press|year=2003|isbn=1587430584|location=Grand Rapids, MI|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This term is meant to signify or distinguish between technological devices and "focal things and practices," which matter to people in their everyday affairs.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage196"&gt;Borgmann (1984), p196.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A focal thing is something of ultimate concern and significance, which may be masked by the device paradigm, and must be preserved by its intimate connection with practice.&lt;ref&gt;Borgmann, (1984), p210.&lt;/ref&gt; Borgmann used the case of [[wine]] to explain this. He cited that the focal thing in [[winemaking]] involves the implements used to produce wine. Wine becomes a device when it employs technology and machinery not merely to produce wine but obtain specific qualities such as grapey, smooth, light, and fruity flavors or clean and clear appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life: A Philosophical Inquiry|last=Borgman|first=Albert|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2009|isbn=0226066290|location=Chicago|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As technological devices increase the availability of a commodity or service, they also push these devices into the background where people do not pay attention to their destructive tendencies.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage41"&gt;Borgmann (1984), p41.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the technology of central heating means that warmth is readily available and family members can retreat into the solitude of their rooms instead of working to chop wood or stoke the fires. Social interaction is reduced and the family struggles to find activities that enable such nurturing and care for each other.&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage41" /&gt; The ubiquitous nature of information technology also makes it an important example of device paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XM7teVMRRQUC&amp;pg=PA352|title=Technology and the Good Life?|last=Higgs|first=Eric|last2=Light|first2=Andrew|last3=Strong|first3=David|date=2010-12-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226333885|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borgmannpage196" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borgmann (1984), p207.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Doll fetishism''' is a [[sexual fetish]] in which an individual is attracted to [[doll]]s and doll like objects such as [[figurine]]s. The attraction may include the desire for actual sexual contact with a doll, a fantasy of a sexual encounter with an animate or inanimate doll, encounters between dolls themselves, or sexual pleasure gained from thoughts of being transformed or transforming another into a doll.

[[Roleplay]]
When the couple/significant enjoy being dressed up as a "doll", usually big lolita/victorian outifts/ or lingery undergarments in sexual ways. Can also include bondage like a marrionete or nicknames such as "Baby doll", "Doll", "little marrionete", and other names associated with the doll type style. This fetish is usually very pretty and pampered type [and very kinky at times].

==As a fantasy==

Though not common it can involve intercourse or other sexual activity with dolls.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5343">'''Editio Critica Maior (ECM)''' is a critical edition of the Greek New Testament being produced by the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung]] (Eng. "Institute for New Testament Textual Research") -which is famous for [[Kurt Aland|Kurt Aland's]] [[Novum Testamentum Graece|'''Nestle-Aland - Novum Testament Graece''']] e.g.- in collaboration with other international institutes. The 'ECM' documents the history of the Greek text through the first millennium on the basis of Greek manuscripts, old translations, and New Testament citations in ancient Christian literature that are of significance to the history of transmission. On the basis of genealogical investigations of the material, first prepared with this completeness, the original text of the [[Greek New Testament]] is reconstructed.
The Editio Critica Maior project is supported by the [[Union of German Academies of Sciences and Humanities]]. It is to be completed by the year 2030.

== The beginnings ==
Since the founding of the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung]] (INTF) in 1959 by Kurt Aland, manuscripts – some of which had previously been unknown or lost, were traced and photographed, and all known manuscripts were photographed and cataloged. The INTF thus acquired over 90% of the known material on microfilm or photo.

== First evaluation ==
In the mid-1980s, a text program was developed. Uniform texts, which, as is well known, constituted the main part in the transmission of the high-middle age – have been dropped out. After the elimination of these texts, the material that is relevant to the textual history of the first millennium is now available: in addition to the manuscripts of this period, the numerous among later manuscripts, which reflect the older textual history. 
The (still) very high number of relevant manuscripts is gradually transcribed and subjected to a complete text comparison (Vollkollation). The results are recorded in databases. For the first time this allows a computer-assisted exploration of the entire material. Above all, the acquisition of genealogical data is important, which illuminates the textual history and especially its beginnings. 

== The digitization ==
The institute uses digital methods at all levels of its philological work: handwriting is captured in the highest possible quality as digital photos. These photos are the basis for the transcriptions to be made on the computer. Additionally digitized material from other institutes is taken into consideration. The software Collate is then used to prepare the critical edition. 

== The result ==
In 1997 the first installment of this edition was published by [[Barbara Aland]]. The ''Catholic Letters'' and also ''The Acts of the Apostels'' are available printed and digitally (by using the [[New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room]]). In cooperation with the [[International Greek New Testament Project]], the ''Johannesevangelium'' is in preparation. In addition an edition, that has been published in printed form, a digital platform - the [[New Testament Virtual Manuscript Room]] has been developed, which allows online access to all data collected during the work on the ECM. This includes above all the diplomatic transcripts of all the manuscripts used in the ECM and the databases on which the ECM is based on. 
The recent editions of ''Nestle-Aland'' in the 28th edition and the 5th edition of the ''Greek New Testament'' of the ''United Bible Societies'' are in the text after the ECM, as far as it has been published so far.

==Current editions==
The ''Novum Testamentum Graecum Editio Critica Maior'' is published by [[Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft]] (the German Bible Society).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15504">[[File:Aspects of music illustration.png|thumb|This notation indicates differing pitch, dynamics, articulation, instrumentation, timbre, and rhythm (duration and onset/order).]]

[[Music]] can be [[music analysis|analysed]] by considering a variety of its '''elements''', or [[property (philosophy)|parts]] (aspects, characteristics, features), individually or together. A commonly used list of the main elements includes pitch, timbre, texture, volume, duration and form. The elements of music may be compared to the [[elements of art]] or [[design elements and principles|design]].

==Selection of elements==

According to [[Howard Gardner|Howard]] {{harvtxt|Gardner|1983|loc=104}}, there is little dispute about the principal constituent elements of music, though experts differ on their precise definitions. Harold Owen bases his list on the qualities of sound: pitch, timbre, intensity, and duration {{harv|Owen|2000|loc=6}}. Most definitions of music include a reference to sound ({{harvnb| Google.com.au |2015}}; {{harvnb| Dictionary.com |2015}}; {{harvnb|Merriam-webster.com |2015}}; {{harvnb|Anon.|1991, 1994, 1998, 2000, 2003}}) and sound perception can be divided into six cognitive processes. They are: [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[duration (music)|duration]], [[loudness]], [[timbre]], [[texture (music)|sonic texture]] and  [[Sound localization|spatial location]] ({{harvnb|Burton|2015|loc=22–28}}).

A '''parameter''' is any element that can be manipulated ([[musical composition|composed]]) separately from other elements or focused on separately in an educational context.{{citation needed|date=June 2016|reason=bolded term}} [[Leonard B. Meyer]] compares distinguishing parameters within a culture by their different constraints to distinguishing independent parameters within music, such as melody, harmony, timbre, "etc." {{harv|Meyer|1989|loc=21n44}}. The first person to apply the term ''[[parameter]]'' to music may have been [[Joseph Schillinger]], though its relative popularity may be due to [[Werner Meyer-Eppler]] {{harv|Grant|2005|loc=62n85}}. ''Gradation'' is gradual change within one parameter, or an overlapping of two blocks of sound.

Meyer gives melody, rhythm, timbre, harmony, "and the like" {{harv|Meyer|1973|loc=9}}, while Narmour lists, melody, harmony, rhythm, dynamics, tessitura, timbre, tempo, meter, texture, "and perhaps others" {{harv|Narmour|1988|loc=326}}. According to McClellan, two things should be considered, the quality or state of an element and its change over time {{harv|McClellan|2000|loc=142}}. [[Alan P. Merriam|Alan P.]] {{harvtxt|Merriam|1964|loc=32–33}} proposed a theoretical research model that assumes three aspects are always present in musical activity: concept, behaviour, and sound. [[Virgil Thomson|Virgil]] {{harvtxt|Thomson|1957|loc=vii}} lists the "raw materials" of music in order of their supposed discovery: rhythm, melody, and harmony; including [[counterpoint]] and [[orchestration]]. Near the end of the twentieth century music scholarship began to give more attention to social and physical elements of music&lt;!-- (see Keller and Rieger 2009)--&gt; {{harv|Moran|2013|loc=59}}. For example: [[concert|performance]], [[sociomusicology|social]], [[women in music|gender]], [[dance]], and [[musical theater|theater]].

==Definition of music==
[[File:Circular definition of musicality.png|thumb|[[Circular definition]] of "musicality"]]
{{Main|Definition of music}}
Does the definition of music determine its aspects, or does the combination of certain aspects determine the definition of music? For example, [[intensional definition]]s list aspects or elements that make up their subject.

Some definitions refer to music as a score, or a composition ({{harvnb| Dictionary.com |2015}}; {{harvnb| Merriam-webster.com |2015}}; {{harvnb| Oxforddictionaries.com}}): music can be read as well as heard, and a piece of music written but never played is a piece of music notwithstanding. The process of [[sight-reading|reading music]], at least for trained musicians, involves a process, called "inner hearing" or "audiation" by Gordon, where the music is heard in the mind as if it were being played {{harv|Gordon |1999}}. This suggests that while sound is often considered a required aspect of music, it may not be.

[[Jean Molino|Jean]] {{harvtxt|Molino|1975|loc=43}} points out that "any element belonging to the total musical fact can be isolated, or taken as a strategic variable of musical production." Nattiez gives as examples [[Mauricio Kagel]]'s ''Con Voce'' [with voice], where a masked trio silently mimes playing instruments. In this example sound, a common element, is excluded, while gesture, a less common element, is given primacy. However Nattiez goes on to say that despite special cases where sound is not immediately obvious (because it is heard in the mind): "sound is a minimal condition of the musical fact" {{harv|Nattiez|1990|loc=43}}.

==Universal aspect==
{{anchor|Invariances}}{{anchor|Invariance}}
There is disagreement about whether some aspects of music are [[Universality (philosophy)|universal]], as well as whether the concept of music is universal. This debate often hinges on definitions. For instance, the fairly common assertion that "tonality" is a universal of all music may necessarily require an expansive definition of tonality. A [[pulse (music)|pulse]] is sometimes taken as a universal, yet there exist solo vocal and instrumental genres with free and improvisational rhythms no regular pulse {{harv|Johnson|2002|loc=62}}, one example being the [[alap]] section of an [[Indian classical music]] performance. Harwood questions whether a "cross-cultural musical universal" may be found in the music or in the making of music, including performance, hearing, conception, and education {{harv|Harwood|1976|loc=522}}.

One aspect that is important to bear in mind when examining multi-cultural associations, is that an English-language word (i.e. the word "music"), not a universal concept, is the object of scrutiny. For this reason it is important to approach apparently equivalent words in other languages with caution. Based on the many disparate definitions that can be found just in English language dictionaries ({{harvnb| Google.com.au |2015}}; {{harvnb| Dictionary.com |2015}}; {{harvnb|Merriam-webster.com |2015}}; {{harvnb|Music|1991, 1994, 1998, 2000, 2003}}), it seems there is no agreement on what the word "Music" means in English,{{original research inline|date=June 2016}}&lt;!--Drawing a conclusion from comparing several dictionaries is Original Research.--&gt; let alone determining a potentially equivalent word from another culture.

Kenneth Gourlay describes how, since different cultures include different elements in their definitions of music, dance, and related concepts, translation of the words for these activities may split or combine them, citing Nigerian musicologist Chinyere Nwachukwu's definition of the Igbo term "nkwa" {{harv|Nwachukwu|1981|loc=59}} as an activity combining and/or requiring singing, playing musical instruments, and dancing {{harv|Gourlay|1984|loc=35}}. He then concludes that there exists "nonuniversality of music and the universality of nonmusic."

==Other terms==
Other terms used to discuss particular pieces include:
* [[Musical note|Note]]—an abstraction that refers to either a specific pitch or rhythm, or the written symbol
*[[chord (music)|Chord]]—a [[simultaneity]] of notes heard as some sort of unit
*[[Chord progression]]—a succession of chords ([[simultaneity succession]])

The '''European Network for Accreditation of Engineering Education''' (ENAEE) authorises quality assurance and accreditation (educational) agencies within the [[European Higher Education Area]] (EHEA) and awards the EUR-ACE label to accredited engineering degree programmes.

The [[EUR-ACE label]] is a ''certificate'' awarded by an authorised accreditation agency to an engineering degree programme which has reached certain educational standards.

ENAEE is an International Association. It is registered as not-for-profit organisation with the number 882.389.895 as governed by the measures of Title III of the Belgian Law of 27 June 1921 &lt;ref name="enaee"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.enaee.eu/publications/statutes-and-by-laws | title=Statutes and By-laws | publisher=European Network for Accreditation of Engineering Education | date=12 October 2011 | accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; on non-profit making associations, non-profit making foundations and international associations.

==History of ENAEE==
The European Standing Observatory for the Engineering Profession and Education (ESOEPE) was established in September 2000. Its aim was to improve systems of accreditation of engineering degree programmes in Europe.

In 2004 ESOEPE submitted a proposal to the European Commission. This proposal envisaged the establishment of a quality label (the EUR-ACE Label) which could be awarded to engineering degree programmes which had reached certain educational standards, as defined by their learning outcomes.
The proposal was accepted by the EU Commission and funding provided for the project.

ESOEPE was dissolved; ENAEE was established and implemented the EUR-ACE Project. The EUR-ACE Project concluded on 31/03/2006 with the presentation of the results in a public workshop in which the EUR-ACE label was listed among the six EC-sponsored “European quality labels in higher education”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agreement of Co-Operation between the European Consortium for Accreditation (ECA) and the Network of Central and Eastern European Quality Assurance Agencies in Higher Education (CEEN)|url=http://www.ecaconsortium.net/admin/files/assets/subsites/1/documenten/1264160909_cooperation-agreement-eca-ceen.pdf|work=ECA Consortium|accessdate=12 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 19 June 2014 ENAEE had authorised thirteen agencies to award the EUR-ACE label to more than 1600 engineering degree programmes in 300 universities and other higher education institutions in 21 countries both within and outside of Europe &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://enaee.trynisis.com/ | title=ENAEE Database of EUR-ACE Labelled Programmes | publisher=European Network of Accreditation for Engineering Education | accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach to using learning outcomes in the ENAEE European Framework Standards has been corroborated in a number of publications and projects since the establishment of ENAEE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/a-tuning-ahelo-conceptual-framework-of-expected-desired-learning-outcomes-in-engineering_5kghtchn8mbn-en?citeformat=ris |title=Cite Publication |publisher=OECD iLibrary |date= |accessdate=2013-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://empleo.ugr.es/unilo/ |title=UNILO |publisher=Empleo.ugr.es |date=2013-01-09 |accessdate=2013-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013133241/http://empleo.ugr.es/unilo/ |archivedate=2013-10-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wfeo-ceie.org/File/c7ee24657f647c1da9eb3b82919b7834.PDF | publisher=World Federation of Engineering Organizations | title=Up-dated Information paper on mobility prepared for WFEO Standing Committee on Education In Engineering (CEIE) | date=December 2011 | accessdate=October 11, 2013 | author=Greenwood, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 November 2014, the thirteen authorised agencies signed a Mutual Recognition Agreement whereby they accept each other's accreditation decisions in respect of Bachelor and Master engineering degree programmes which they accredit.

== Agencies authorised to award the EUR-ACE label ==
To be authorised to award the EUR-ACE label, (which is a certificate that states that an engineering degree programme has reached certain educational standards) an accreditation agency has to meet quality requirements and accredit in accordance with the EUR-ACE Framework Standards of ENAEE.&lt;ref name=ihep&gt;{{cite web|title=EUR-ACE Framework Standards for the Accreditation of Engineering Programmes|url=http://www.ihep.org/assets/files/gcfp-files/EUR-ACESTANDARDS.pdf|accessdate=12 October 2013|pages=1–15|date=17 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both HEIs and accreditation agencies must comply with the Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance for the Higher Education Area, as adopted by Bologna Ministers in Bergen in May 2005.&lt;ref name="enqa"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.enqa.eu/pubs_esg.lasso | title=Publicationst | publisher=ENQA | date=1 March 2005 | accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of these agencies in turn then accredits the engineering degree courses that have reached the required standards. So if a Higher Education Institution (HEI) wishes to apply for a EUR-ACE label for its engineering degree courses, it must apply to one of the authorised agencies below. If the HEI is not in one of the countries below, it must then contact ENAEE directly.

'''Fuzzy Markup Language''' ('''FML''') is a specific purpose markup language based on [[XML]], used for describing the structure and behavior of a [[fuzzy system]] independently of the hardware architecture devoted to host and run it.

==Overview==
FML was designed and developed by Giovanni Acampora during his Ph.D. course in Computer Science, at University of Salerno, Italy, in 2004. The original idea inspired Giovanni Acampora to create FML was the necessity of creating a cooperative fuzzy-based framework aimed at automatically controlling a living environment characterized by a plethora of heterogeneous devices whose interactions were devoted to maximize the human comfort under energy saving constraints. This framework represented one of the first concrete examples of [[AmI|Ambient Intelligence]]. Beyond this pioneering application, the major advantage of using XML to describe a fuzzy system is hardware/software interoperability. Indeed, all that is needed to read an FML file is the appropriate schema for that file, and an FML parser. This markup approach makes it much easier to exchange fuzzy systems between software: for example, a machine learning application could extract fuzzy rules which could then be read directly into a fuzzy inference engine or uploaded into a fuzzy controller. Also, with technologies like [[XSLT]], it is possible to compile the FML into the programming language of your choice, ready for embedding into whatever application you please. As stated by Mike Watts on his popular Computational Intelligence blog:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Watts |first=Mike |url=http://computational-intelligence.blogspot.it/2011/05/fuzzy-markup-language.html |title=Computational Intelligence: Fuzzy Markup Language |publisher=Computational-intelligence.blogspot.it |date=2011-05-28 |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Although Acampora's motivation for developing FML seems to be to develop embedded fuzzy controllers for ambient intelligence applications, FML could be a real boon for developers of fuzzy rule extraction algorithms: from my own experience during my PhD, I know that having to design a file format and implement the appropriate parsers for rule extraction and fuzzy inference engines can be a real pain, taking as much time as implementing the rule extraction algorithm itself. I would much rather have used something like FML for my work."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A complete overview of FML and related applications can be found in the book titled ''On the power of Fuzzy Markup Language''&lt;ref name=Acampora2013/&gt; edited by Giovanni Acampora, Chang-Shing Lee, Vincenzo Loia and Mei-Hui Wang, and published by Springer in the series ''Studies on Fuzziness and Soft Computing''.

==FML at work: syntax, grammar and hardware synthesis==
FML allows fuzzy systems to be coded through a collection of correlated semantic tags capable of modeling the different components of a classical fuzzy controller such as knowledge base, rule base, fuzzy variables and fuzzy rules. Therefore, the FML tags used to build a fuzzy controller represent the set of lexemes used to create fuzzy expressions. In order to design a well-formed XML-based language, an FML context-free grammar is defined by means of a XML schema which defines name, type and attributes characterized each XML element. However, since an FML program represents only a static view of a fuzzy logic controller, the so-called eXtensible Stylesheet Language Translator (XSLT) is provided to change this static view to a computable version. Indeed, XSLTs modules are able to convert the FML-based fuzzy controller in a general purpose computer language using an XSL file containing the translation description. At this level, the control is executable for the hardware. In short, FML is essentially composed by three layers:
* XML in order to create a new markup language for fuzzy logic control;
* a XML Schema in order to define the legal building blocks;
* eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) in order to convert a fuzzy controller description into a specific programming language.

===FML Syntax===
FML syntax is composed of XML tags and attributes which describe the different components of a fuzzy logic controller listed below:
*fuzzy knowledge base;
*fuzzy rule base;
*inference engine
*fuzzification subsystem;
*defuzzification subsystem.

In detail, the opening tag of each FML program is &lt;code&gt;&lt;FuzzyController&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which represents the fuzzy controller under modeling. This tag has two attributes: ''name'' and ''ip''. The first attribute permits to specify the name of fuzzy controller and ''ip'' is used to define the location of controller in a computer network. The fuzzy knowledge base is defined by means of the tag &lt;code&gt;&lt;KnowledgeBase&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which maintains the set of fuzzy concepts used to model the fuzzy rule base. In order to define the fuzzy
concept related controlled system, &lt;code&gt;&lt;KnowledgeBase&gt;&lt;/code&gt;  tag uses a set of nested tags:
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;FuzzyVariable&gt;&lt;/code&gt; defines the fuzzy concept;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;FuzzyTerm&gt;&lt;/code&gt; defines a linguistic term describing the fuzzy concept; 
*a set of tags defining a shape of fuzzy sets are related to fuzzy terms. 
The attributes of &lt;code&gt;&lt;FuzzyVariable&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag are: ''name'', ''scale'', ''domainLeft'', ''domainRight'', ''type'' and, for only an output, ''accumulation'', ''defuzzifier'' and ''defaultValue''. The ''name'' attribute defines the name of fuzzy concept, for instance, ''temperature''; ''scale'' is used to define the scale used to measure the fuzzy concept, for instance, ''Celsius degree''; ''domainLeft'' and ''domainRight'' are used to model the universe of discourse of fuzzy concept, that is, the set of real values related to fuzzy concept, for instance [0°,40°] in the case of Celsius degree; the position of fuzzy concept into rule (consequent part or antecedent part) is defined by ''type'' attribute (input/output); ''accumulation'' attribute defines the method of accumulation that is a method that permits the combination of results of a variable of each rule in a final result; ''defuzzifier'' attribute defines the method used to execute the conversion from a fuzzy set, obtained after aggregation process, into a numerical value to give it in output to system; ''defaultValue'' attribute defines a real value used only when no rule has fired for the variable at issue.
As for tag &lt;code&gt;&lt;FuzzyTerm&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, it uses two attributes: ''name'' used to identify the linguistic value associate with fuzzy concept and ''complement'', a boolean attribute that defines, if it is true, it is necessary to consider the complement of membership function defined by given parameters. Fuzzy shape tags, used to complete the definition of fuzzy concept, are:
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;TRIANGULARSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;RIGHTLINEARSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;LEFTLINEARSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;PISHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;GAUSSIANSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;RIGHTGAUSSIANSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;LEFTGAUSSIANSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;TRAPEZOIDSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;SSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;ZSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;RECTANGULARSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;SINGLETONSHAPE&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
Every shaping tag uses a set of attributes which defines the real outline of corresponding fuzzy set. The number of these attributes depends on the chosen fuzzy set shape.

In order to make an example, let us consider the ''Tipper Inference System'' described in Mathwork Matlab Fuzzy Logic Toolbox Tutorial. This Mamdani system is used to regulate the tipping in, for example, a restaurant. It has got two variables in input (''food'' and ''service'') and one in output (''tip''). FML code for modeling part of knowledge base of this fuzzy system containing variables ''food'' and ''tip'' is shown below.

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt; 
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;FuzzyController name="newSystem" ip="127.0.0.1"&gt;
    &lt;KnowledgeBase&gt;
        &lt;FuzzyVariable name="food" domainleft="0.0" domainright="10.0" scale="" type="input"&gt;        
            &lt;FuzzyTerm name="delicious" complement="false"&gt;
                &lt;LeftLinearShape Param1="5.5" Param2="10.0"/&gt;
            &lt;/FuzzyTerm&gt;
            &lt;FuzzyTerm name="rancid" complement="false"&gt;
                &lt;TriangularShape Param1="0.0" Param2="2.0" Param3="5.5"/&gt;
            &lt;/FuzzyTerm&gt;
        &lt;/FuzzyVariable&gt;
        ...........
    	&lt;FuzzyVariable name="tip" domainleft="0.0" domainright="20.0" scale="Euro" defaultValue="0.0" defuzzifier="COG"        
 	               accumulation="MAX"  type="output"&gt;
            &lt;FuzzyTerm name="average" complement="false"&gt;
                &lt;TriangularShape Param1="5.0" Param2="10.0" Param3="15.0"/&gt;
            &lt;/FuzzyTerm&gt;
            &lt;FuzzyTerm name="cheap" complement="false"&gt;
                &lt;TriangularShape Param1="0.0" Param2="5.0" Param3="10.0"/&gt;
            &lt;/FuzzyTerm&gt;
            &lt;FuzzyTerm name="generous" complement="false"&gt;
                &lt;TriangularShape Param1="10.0" Param2="15.0" Param3="20.0"/&gt;
            &lt;/FuzzyTerm&gt;
        &lt;/FuzzyVariable&gt;
    &lt;KnowledgeBase&gt;
    ............
&lt;/FuzzyController&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

A special tag that can furthermore be used to define a fuzzy shape is &lt;code&gt;&lt;UserShape&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This tag is used to customize fuzzy shape (custom shape). The custom shape modeling is performed via a set of &lt;code&gt;&lt;Point&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags that lists the extreme points of geometric area defining the custom fuzzy shape. Obviously, the attributes used in &lt;code&gt;&lt;Point&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag are x and y coordinates. 
As for rule base component, FML allows to define a set of rule bases, each one of them describes a different behavior of system. The root of each rule base is modeled by &lt;code&gt;&lt;RuleBase&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag which defines a fuzzy rule set. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;RuleBase&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag uses five attributes: ''name'', ''type'', ''activationMethod'', ''andMethod'' and ''orMethod''. Obviously, the ''name'' attribute uniquely identifies the rule base. The ''type'' attribute permits to specify the kind of fuzzy controller (Mamdani or TSK) respect to the rule base at issue. The ''activationMethod'' attribute defines the method used to implication process; the ''andMethod'' and ''orMethod'' attribute define, respectively, the ''and'' and ''or'' algorithm to use by default.  In order to define the single rule the &lt;code&gt;&lt;Rule&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is used. The attributes used by the &lt;code&gt;&lt;Rule&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag are: ''name'', ''connector'', ''operator'' and ''weight''. The ''name'' attribute permits to identify the rule; ''connector'' is used to define the logical operator used to connect the different clauses in antecedent part (and/or); ''operator'' defines the algorithm to use for chosen connector; ''weight'' defines the importance of rule during inference engine step. The definition of antecedent and consequent rule part is obtained by using &lt;code&gt;&lt;Antecedent&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;Consequent&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags. &lt;code&gt;&lt;Clause&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is used to model the fuzzy clauses in antecedent and consequent part. This tag use the attribute ''modifier'' to describe a modification to term used in the clause. The possible values for this attribute are: ''above'', ''below'', ''extremely'', ''intensify'', ''more or less'', ''norm'', ''not'', ''plus'', ''slightly'', ''somewhat'', ''very'', ''none''. To complete the definition of fuzzy clause the nested &lt;code&gt;&lt;Variable&gt;&lt;/code&gt;  and &lt;code&gt;&lt;Term&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags have to be used. A sequence of &lt;code&gt;&lt;Rule&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags realizes a fuzzy rule base.

As example, let us consider a Mamdani rule composed by ''(food is rancid) OR (service is very poor)'' as antecedent and ''tip is cheap'' as consequent. The antecedent part is formed by two clauses: ''(food is rancid)'' and ''(service is poor)''. The first antecedent clause uses ''food'' as variable and ''rancid'' as fuzzy term, whereas, the second antecedent clause uses ''service'' as a variable, ''poor'' as fuzzy term and ''very'' as modifier; the consequent clause uses ''tip'' as a fuzzy variable and ''cheap'' as a fuzzy term. The complete rule is:

'''IF''' ''(food is rancid)'' '''OR''' ''(service is very poor)'' '''THEN''' ''(tip is cheap)''.

Let us see how FML defines a rule base with this rule.

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt; 
&lt;RuleBase name="Rulebase1" activationMethod="MIN" andMethod="MIN" orMethod="MAX" type="mamdani"&gt;
      &lt;Rule name="reg1" connector="or" operator="MAX" weight="1.0"&gt;
           &lt;Antecedent&gt;
                &lt;Clause&gt;
                    &lt;Variable&gt;food&lt;/Variable&gt;
                    &lt;Term&gt;rancid&lt;/Term&gt;
                &lt;/Clause&gt;
                &lt;Clause modifier="very"&gt;
                    &lt;Variable&gt;service&lt;/Variable&gt;
                    &lt;Term&gt;poor&lt;/Term&gt;
                &lt;/Clause&gt;
            &lt;/Antecedent&gt;
            &lt;Consequent&gt;
                &lt;Clause&gt;
                    &lt;Variable&gt;tip&lt;/Variable&gt;
                    &lt;Term&gt;cheap&lt;/Term&gt;
                &lt;/Clause&gt;
            &lt;/Consequent&gt;
      &lt;/Rule&gt;
      ............
&lt;/RuleBase&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Now, let us see a Takagi-Sugeno-Kang system that regulates the same issue. The most important difference with Mamdani system is the definition of a different output variable ''tip''. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;TSKVariable&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is used to define an output variable that can be used in a rule of a Tsk system. This tag has the same attributes of a Mamdani output variable except for the ''domainleft'' and ''domainright'' attribute because a variable of this kind (called tsk-variable) hasn’t a universe of discourse. The nested &lt;code&gt;&lt;TSKTerm&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag represents a linear function and so it is completely different from &lt;code&gt;&lt;FuzzyTerm&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;&lt;TSKValue&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag is used to define the coefficients of linear function. The following crunch of FML code shows the definition of output variable ''tip'' in a Tsk system.

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt; 
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;FuzzyController name="newSystem" ip="127.0.0.1"&gt;
    &lt;KnowledgeBase&gt;
 	.......
        &lt;TSKVariable name="tip" scale="null" accumulation="MAX" defuzzifier="WA" type="output"&gt;
            &lt;TSKTerm name="average" order="0"&gt;
                &lt;TSKValue&gt;1.6&lt;/TSKValue&gt;
            &lt;/TSKTerm&gt;
            &lt;TSKTerm name="cheap" order="1"&gt;
                &lt;TSKValue&gt;1.9&lt;/TSKValue&gt;
                &lt;TSKValue&gt;5.6&lt;/TSKValue&gt;
                &lt;TSKValue&gt;6.0&lt;/TSKValue&gt;
            &lt;/TSKTerm&gt;
            &lt;TSKTerm name="generous" order="1"&gt;
                &lt;TSKValue&gt;0.6&lt;/TSKValue&gt;
                &lt;TSKValue&gt;1.3&lt;/TSKValue&gt;
                &lt;TSKValue&gt;1.0&lt;/TSKValue&gt;
            &lt;/TSKTerm&gt;
        &lt;/TSKVariable&gt;
    &lt;KnowledgeBase&gt;
    ..........
&lt;/FuzzyController&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The FML definition of rule base component in a Tsk system doesn’t change a lot. The only different thing is that the &lt;code&gt;&lt;Clause&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag doesn’t have the modifier attribute.

As example, let us consider a tsk rule composed by ''(food is rancid) OR (service is very poor)'' as antecedent and, as consequent, ''tip=1.9+5.6*food+6.0*service'' that can be written as ''tip is cheap'' in an implicitly way. So the rule can be written in this way:
	
'''IF''' ''(food is rancid)'' '''OR''' ''(service is very poor)'' '''THEN''' ''(tip is cheap)''.

Let us see how FML defines a rule base with this rule.

&lt;source lang="xml"&gt; 
&lt;RuleBase name="Rulebase1" activationMethod="MIN" andMethod="MIN" orMethod="MAX" type="tsk"&gt;
&lt;Rule name="reg1" connector="or" operator="MAX" weight="1.0"&gt;
            &lt;Antecedent&gt;
                &lt;Clause&gt;
                    &lt;Variable&gt;food&lt;/Variable&gt;
                    &lt;Term&gt;rancid&lt;/Term&gt;
                &lt;/Clause&gt;
                &lt;Clause&gt;
                    &lt;Variable&gt;service&lt;/Variable&gt;
                    &lt;Term&gt;poor&lt;/Term&gt;
                &lt;/Clause&gt;
            &lt;/Antecedent&gt;
            &lt;Consequent&gt;
                &lt;Clause&gt;
                    &lt;Variable&gt;tip&lt;/Variable&gt;
                    &lt;Term&gt;cheap&lt;/Term&gt;
                &lt;/Clause&gt;
            &lt;/Consequent&gt;
        &lt;/Rule&gt;
	............
&lt;/RuleBase&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===FML Grammar===
The FML tags used to build a fuzzy controller represent the set of lexemes used to create fuzzy expressions. However, in order to realize a well-formed XML-based language, an FML context-free grammar is necessary and described in the following. The FML context-free grammar is modeled by XML file in the form of a XML Schema Document (XSD) which expresses the set of rules to which a document must conform in order to be considered a ''valid'' FML document. Based on the previous definition, a portion of the FML XSD regarding the knowledge base definition is given below.

===FML Synthesis===
Since an FML program realizes only a static view of a fuzzy system, the so-called eXtensible Stylesheet Language Translator (XSLT) is provided to change this static view to a computable version. In particular, the XSLT technology is used convert a fuzzy controller description into a general-purpose computer language to be computed on several hardware platforms. Currently, a XSLT converting FML program in runnable Java code has been implemented. In this way, thanks to the transparency capabilities provided by Java virtual machines, it is possible to obtain a fuzzy controller modeled in high level way by means of FML and runnable on a plethora of hardware architectures through Java technologies. However, XSLT can be also used for converting FML programs in legacy languages related to a particular hardware or in other general purpose languages.

'''Hexazinone''' is an [[organic compound]] that is used as a broad spectrum [[herbicide]].  It is a colorless solid.  It exhibits some solubility in water but is highly soluble in most organic solvents except alkanes.  A member  of the [[triazine]] class herbicides, it is manufactured by [[DuPont]] and sold under the trade name '''Velpar'''.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold P. Appleby, Franz Müller, Serge Carpy "Weed Control" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a28_165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It functions by inhibiting photosynthesis and thus is a nonselective herbicide.  It is used to control grasses, broadleaf, and woody plants. Approximately 33% is used on alfalfa, 31% in forestry, 29% in industrial areas, 4% on rangeland and pastures, and &lt; 2% on sugarcane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pmep.cce.cornell.edu/profiles/herb-growthreg/fatty-alcohol-monuron/hexazinone/herb-prof-hexazinone.html Hexazinone], Herbicide Profile, Pesticide Management Education Program, [[Cornell University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hexazinone is a pervasive groundwater contaminant, due to its high water solubility

== History ==
Hexazinone is widely used as a herbicide. It is a non-selective herbicide from the triazine family. It's is used among a broad range of places. It is used to control weeds within all sort of applications. From sugarcane plantations, forestry field nurseries, pineapple plantations to high- and railway grasses and industrial plant sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Huili|last2=Xu|first2=Shuxia|last3=Tan|first3=Chengxia|last4=Wang|first4=Xuedong|date=2009-05-30|title=Anaerobic biodegradation of hexazinone in four sediments|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389408012752|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|volume=164|issue=2–3|pages=806–811|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2008.08.073}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hexazinone was first registered in 1975 for the overall control of weeds and later for uses in crops.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov/pesticides/reregistration/web/pdf/0266fact.pdf|title=Hexazinone: Reregistration Eligibility Decision (RED) Fact Sheet|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and reactivity ==
Triazines like hexazinone can bind to the D-1 quinone protein of the electron transport chain in photosystem II to inhibit the photosynthesis. These diverted electrons can thereby damage membranes and destroy cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://agron-www.agron.iastate.edu/Courses/Agron317/Photosynthesis_Inhibitors.htm|title=Agronomy 317 - Iowa State University|website=agron-www.agron.iastate.edu|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synthesis ==
Hexazinone can be synthesized in two different reaction processes. One process starts with a reaction of [[methyl chloroformate]] with [[cyanamide]], forming hexazinone after a five-step pathway:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/470787466|title=Ullmann's agrochemicals.|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=9783527316045|oclc=470787466}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hexazinon1.svg|border|frameless|520x520px]]

A second synthesis starts with methyl[[thiourea]].:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Hexazinon2.svg|border|frameless|618x818px]]

== Degradation ==
The degradation of hexazinone has long been studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helling|first=C. S.|last2=Kearney|first2=P. C.|last3=Alexander|first3=M.|year=1971|title=Behavior of pesticides in soil|url=|journal=Adv. Agron.|volume=23|pages=147–240|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It degrades approximately 10% in five weeks, when exposed to artificial sunlight in distilled water. However, degradation in natural waters can be three to seven times greater. Surprisingly, the [[pH]] and the temperature of the water do not affect the [[photodegradation]] significantly.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rhodes|first=R. C.|year=1980b|title=Studies with 14C-labeled hexazinone in water and bluegill sunfish|url=|journal=J. Agric. Food Chem.|volume=28|pages=306–310|via=|doi=10.1021/jf60228a002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is mainly degraded by aerobic microorganisms in soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rhodes|first=R. C.|year=1980a|title=Soil Studies with 14C-labeled hexazinone|url=|journal=J. Agric. Food Chem.|volume=28|pages=311–315|via=|doi=10.1021/jf60228a012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanism of action ==
Hexazinone is a broad-spectrum residual and contact [[herbicide]], rapidly absorbed by the leaves and roots. It is tolerated by conifers, and therefore it is a very effective [[herbicide]] for the control for [[Annual plant|annual]] and [[Perennial plant|perennial]] [[Broad-leaved tree|broadleaf]] weeds, some grasses, and some woody species. Hexazinone works as rain or snowmelt makes it possible for the [[herbicide]] to move downward into the soil. There the hexazinone is absorbed from the soil by the roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental fates and impacts of major forest use pesticides|last=Ghassemi|first=M., et al.|publisher=|year=1981|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=169–194}}&lt;/ref&gt; It moves through the conductive tissues to the leaves, where it blocks the [[photosynthesis]] of the plant within the [[chloroplast]]s. Hexazinone binds to a protein of the [[photosystem II]] complex, which blocks the electron transport. The result are multiple following reactions. First triplet-state [[chlorophyll]] reacts with [[oxygen]] to form [[singlet oxygen]]. Both [[chlorophyll]] and [[singlet oxygen]] then remove [[hydrogen ion]]s from the unsaturated [[lipid]]s present in de cells and the organelle membranes, forming lipid radicals. These radicals will oxydize other lipids and proteins, eventually resulting in loss of the membrane integrity of the cells and organelles. This will result in a loss of [[chlorophyll]], leakage of cellular contents, cell death, and eventually death of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wssa.net/|title=Weed Science Society of America|website=wssa.net|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woody plants first show yellowing of the leaves before they start to defoliate, eventually they will die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sidhu|first=S. S.|last2=Feng.|first2=J. C.|year=1993|title=Hexazinone and its metabolites in boreal forest vegetation.|url=|journal=Weed Sci.|volume=41|pages=281–287|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes plants are able to refoliate and defoliate again during the growing season.

The influence of the Islamic world to the history of glass is reflected by its distribution around the world, from Europe to China, and from Russia to East Africa. '''Islamic glass''' developed a unique expression that was characterized by the introduction of new techniques and the innovation of old traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roman and Sassanian influences==
Islamic glass did not begin to develop a recognizable expression until the late 8th or early 9th century AD, despite Islam spreading across the Middle East and North Africa during the mid-7th century AD.&lt;ref name="Israeli319"&gt;Israeli 2003, 319&lt;/ref&gt; Despite bringing enormous religious and socio-political changes to the region, this event appears to have not drastically affected the day-to-day workings of craft industries, nor did it cause "extensive destruction or long-lasting disruption".&lt;ref&gt;Schick 1998, 75&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Byzantine glass|Roman]] ([[Levant]] and [[Egypt]]) and [[Sassanian]] ([[Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]) glassmaking industries continued in much the same way they had for centuries. Following the unification of the entire region, the interaction of ideas and techniques was facilitated, allowing for the fusion of these two separate traditions with new ideas, ultimately leading to the Islamic glass industry.&lt;ref name="Israeli319" /&gt; Roman glassmaking traditions that are important in the Islamic period include the application of glass trails as a surface embellishment, while stylistic techniques adopted from the [[Sassanian Empire]] include various styles of glass cutting. This may have developed out of the long-standing [[hardstone carving]] traditions in [[Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 15–17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 115–122&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to glass-making technology, tank furnaces used in the [[Levant]] to produce slabs of raw glass for export during the Classical Period were used during the Early Islamic Period in the same region until the 10th or 11th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;Aldsworth et al. 2002, 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freestone 2006, 202"&gt;Freestone 2006, 202&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technological change==
During the first centuries of Islamic rule, glassmakers in the Eastern Mediterranean continued to use the Roman recipe consisting of calcium-rich sand (providing the silica and lime) and mineral [[natron]] (soda component) from the Wādi el-Natrūn in [[Egypt]], and examples of natron-based Islamic glass have been found in the [[Levant]] up to the late 9th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse 2002, 193–195&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence has shown that the use of [[natron]] ceased, and plant ash became the source of soda for all Islamic glass in the following centuries.&lt;ref name="Dussart et al. 2004"&gt;Dussart et al. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for this technological transition remain unclear, although it has been postulated that civil unrest in [[Egypt]] during the early 9th century AD led to a cut-off in the natron supply, thus forcing Islamic glassmakers to look for alternate soda sources.&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse 2002, 194&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of experimentation with the basic glass recipe at [[Beth She'arim]] (modern [[Israel]]) during the early 9th century AD further supports this argument. A glass slab made from a tank mold from the site contained an excess amount of lime, and may be the result of mixing sand with plant ash.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone and Gorin-Rosin 1999, 116&lt;/ref&gt; Although the raw glass would have been unusable due to its composition, it does suggest that at this time, Islamic glassmakers in the [[Levant]] were combining aspects of [[Sassanian]] and Roman traditions in an effort to solve the problem created by the lack of access to mineral natron. The use of plant ash, specifically from [[halophytic]] (salt-loving) plants, which were plentiful in the [[Middle East]] due to the climate,&lt;ref&gt;Barkoudah and Henderson 2006, 297–298&lt;/ref&gt; was well known in [[Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]. It undoubtedly would not take long for the glassmakers in the [[Near East]] to correct their manufacturing errors and begin using the plant ash-based recipe used further east.

==Early Islamic glass: mid-7th to late 12th century AD==
[[File:Glass beaker MET 40-170-180.jpg|thumb|left|9th century beaker, [[Nishapur]].]]
The glass industry in the Early Islamic Period can initially be characterized as a continuation of older traditions, coinciding with the [[Umayyad]] Caliphate, the first Islamic dynasty (Israeli 2003, 319). Following the rise of the [[Abbasid]] Caliphate in 750 AD, the capital of the Islamic world was moved from [[Damascus]] in the [[Levant]] to [[Baghdad]] in [[Mesopotamia]]. This led to a cultural shift away from the influences of Classical traditions, and allowed for the development of an 'Islamic' expression.&lt;ref name="Israeli 2003, 320"&gt;Israeli 2003, 320&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of glass during this period is concentrated in three main regions of the Islamic world. Firstly, the Eastern Mediterranean remained a centre of glass production, as it had been for centuries. Excavations at Qal'at Sem'an in northern [[Syria]],&lt;ref name="Dussart et al. 2004"/&gt; [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] in [[Lebanon]],&lt;ref&gt;Aldsworth et al. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Beth She'arim]] and Bet Eli'ezer in [[Israel]],&lt;ref name="Freestone 2006, 202"/&gt; and at [[Fustat]] (Old [[Cairo]]) in [[Egypt]]&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001&lt;/ref&gt; have all shown evidence for glass production, including numerous vessels, raw glass, and their associated furnaces. Also adding to our understanding of the glass industry in this region is the aforementioned shipwreck at Serçe Liman. In [[Persia]], a formerly [[Sassanian]] region, archaeological activity has located a number of sites with large deposits of Early Islamic Glass, including [[Nishapur]], [[Siraf]], and [[Susa]].&lt;ref&gt;Kröger 1995, 1–6&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous kilns suggest [[Nishapur]] was an important production centre, and the identification of a local type of glass at [[Siraf]] suggests the same for that site.&lt;ref&gt;Kröger 1995, 5-20&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mesopotamia]], excavations at Samarra, a temporary capital of the [[Abbasid]] Caliphate during the mid-9th century AD, produced a wide range of glass vessels, while work at al-Madā'in (former [[Ctesiphon]]) and [[Raqqa]] (on the [[Euphrates River]] in modern [[Syria]]) provide evidence for glass production in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 2006, 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kröger 1995, 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is difficult to clearly identify the place in which a glass piece was manufactured without the presence of wastes (pieces broken and discarded in the process of making), which indicate that the location was a site of glassmaking. Furthermore, during the Abbasid caliphate, both glassmakers and their products moved throughout the empire, leading to dispersion of glassware and "universality of style", which further prevents the identification of a piece's birthplace. As the Seljuk empire arose from Seljuk generals conquering lands under the Abbasid flag only nominally, it is likely that glass technology, style, and trade might have continued similarly under the Seljuks as it did under the Abbasids.&lt;ref&gt;Ragab 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the increasing ability and style of Islamic glassmakers during this time, few pieces were signed or dated, making identification of a piece's location of origin unfortunately difficult. Glass pieces are typically dated by stylistic comparisons to other pieces from the era.&lt;ref&gt;Lukens 2013, 199&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the decorative traditions used in the Early Islamic Period concerned the manipulation of the glass itself, and included trail-application, carving, and mold-blowing.&lt;ref name="Israeli 2003, 320"/&gt; As mentioned previously, glass-carving and trail application are a continuation of older techniques, the former associated with [[Sassanian]] glassmaking and the latter with Roman traditions. In relief cutting, a specialized form of glass-carving most often used on colourless and transparent glass, "the area surrounding the decorative elements was carved back to the ground, thus leaving the former in relief".&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 116&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Palmer cup DSCF9673 Waddesdon bequest, British Museum.JPG|thumb|A seated prince on the [[Palmer Cup]], an early Iranian painted glass, drawing on motifs used on pottery]]

Unlike relief cutting, trail application, or thread trailing, allowed decoration with hot glass.&lt;ref name="Jenkins 2013, 28"&gt;Jenkins 2013, 28&lt;/ref&gt; The glassblower would manipulate molten glass while still malleable and create patterns, handles, or flanges. While cutting reached the height of its popularity from the 9th–11th centuries CE,&lt;ref&gt;Lukens 2013, 200&lt;/ref&gt; thread-trailing became more widely used during the 11th–12th centuries, when Seljuq glassmakers were considered at the height of their skill.&lt;ref&gt;Lukens 2013, 207&lt;/ref&gt;

Mold-blowing, based on Roman traditions from the 1st century CE, is another specialized technique that spread widely throughout the Islamic Mediterranean world during this period. Two distinct types of molds are known archaeologically; a two-part mold made up of separate halves, and the 'dip' mold, whereby the viscous glass is placed entirely inside one mold.&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 198&lt;/ref&gt; The molds were often made of bronze,&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 197&lt;/ref&gt; although there are examples of some being ceramic.&lt;ref&gt;von Folsach and Whitehouse 1993, 149&lt;/ref&gt; Molds also typically mold that often included a carved pattern; the finished piece would take on the shape and style of the mold (Carboni and Adamjee 2002). With these advances in glassmaking technology, artisans began to stylize and simplify their designs, emphasizing designs with "no foreground or background" and "plain but beautiful vessels".&lt;ref name="Jenkins 2013, 28"/&gt;

A final decorative technology that is a distinct marker of the Early Islamic Period is the use of [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]] painting. While some scholars see this as a purely Islamic invention originating in [[Fustat]],&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 124&lt;/ref&gt; others place the origins of lustre decoration in Roman and [[Coptic Egypt]] during the centuries preceding the rise of [[Islam]]. Staining glass vessels with copper and silver pigments was known from around the 3rd century AD,&lt;ref name="Carboni 2001, 51"&gt;Carboni 2001, 51&lt;/ref&gt; although true lustre technology probably began sometime between the 4th and 8th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith 1985, 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pradell et al. 2008, 1201&lt;/ref&gt; Lustre painting on glass involves the application of copper and silver pigments, followed by a specific firing that allows for the ionic exchange of Ag+ and Cu+ with the glass, resulting in a metallic sheen fully bound to the vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Pradell et al. 2008, 1204&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of its specific origins, lustre decoration was a key technology in glass production that continued to develop throughout the Early Islamic Period, and spread not only geographically, but also to other material industries in the form of glazed ceramics.&lt;ref name="Carboni 2001, 51"/&gt;

==Middle Islamic glass: late 12th to late 14th century AD==
{{see also|Hebron glass}}
This is the 'Golden Age' of Islamic glassmaking,&lt;ref name="Israeli 2003, 321"&gt;Israeli 2003, 321&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fractious nature of the Islamic world. [[Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]] (along with parts of [[Syria]] for some time) came under control of the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] Turks, and later the Mongols, while in the Eastern Mediterranean, the [[Ayyubid]] and [[Mamluk]] Dynasties held sway. Furthermore, this period saw European interruptions into the Middle East due to the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref name="Israeli 2003, 321"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 126&lt;/ref&gt; Glass production seemingly ceased to exist in [[Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]], and little is known about the reasons for this.&lt;ref name="Israeli 2003, 321"/&gt; However, in the earlier part of this period, there is evidence for glass-making in [[Central Asia]], for example at Kuva in modern [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref&gt;Ivanov 2003, 211–212&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition presumably ended with the Mongol invasions of the mid-13th century that destroyed other sites in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Anarbaev and Rehren 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The glass-producing regions of [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] continued their industries. It is for the materials excavated and produced at sites such as [[Samsat]] in southern [[Turkey]],&lt;ref&gt;Redford 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] in [[Syria]],&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 131&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hebron]] in the [[Levant]],&lt;ref name="Spaer 1992, 46"&gt;Spaer 1992, 46&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cairo]]&lt;ref name="Carboni 2001, 323"&gt;Carboni 2001, 323&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israeli 2003, 231&lt;/ref&gt; that this period is referred to as the 'Golden Age' of Islamic glass. The Middle Islamic Period is characterized by the perfection of various polychrome decorative traditions, the most important of which are marvering, [[enamelling]], and [[gilding]], while relief-carving and [[Lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]] painting seemingly fell out of fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 126–130&lt;/ref&gt; Marvering involves applying a continuous trail of opaque glass (in various colours such as white, red, yellow, or pale blue) around the body of a glass object. This trail may then be manipulated by pulling it, creating a characteristic 'wavy' pattern. The object was then rolled on a marver (a stone or iron slab) to work the trail into the glass vessel itself.&lt;ref name="Carboni 2001, 291"&gt;Carboni 2001, 291&lt;/ref&gt; This technique, used on a variety of glass objects from bowls and bottles to chess pieces, was introduced around the late 12th century AD,&lt;ref name="Carboni 2001, 291"/&gt; but is in fact a revival of a much older glass-working tradition that has its origins in the [[Late Bronze Age]] in [[Egypt]]&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tatton-Brown and Andrews 1991, 26&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Container Umar II Louvre OA7448.jpg|thumb|left|Jar with the name of a sultan of [[Yemen]], probably Syria or Egypt, 1290s]]

[[Gilding]] during this period involved applying small amounts of gold in suspension onto a glass body, followed by a low firing to fuse the two materials, and was adopted from [[Byzantine]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 130&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was often combined with enamelling, the application of ground glass with a colourant, to traditional and new vessel forms, and represents the height of Islamic glassmaking.&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 323–325&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enamelling]], a resurrection of older techniques, was first practiced in the Islamic world at [[Raqqa]] (Syria) during the late 12th century, but also spread to [[Cairo]] during [[Mamluk]] rule.&lt;ref name="Carboni 2001, 323"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gudenrath 2006, 42&lt;/ref&gt; A study of various enamelled vessels, including beakers and [[mosque lamp]]s, suggests that there are two subtle yet distinct firing practices, possibly representing two distinct production centres or glass-working traditions.&lt;ref name="Gudenrath 2006, 47"&gt;Gudenrath 2006, 47&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its high demand, enamelled glass was exported throughout the Islamic world, Europe, and China during this period.&lt;ref name="Pinder-Wilson 1991, 135"&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 135&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enamelling]] eventually ended in [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] following disruption by various Mongol invasions from the 13th through to the 15th centuries AD.&lt;ref&gt;Israeli 2003, 376&lt;/ref&gt;

A final note on glass from the Middle Islamic Period is the increased interaction between the Middle East and Europe. The [[Crusades]] allowed for the European discovery of Islamic gilded and enamelled vessels. The 'Goblet of the Eight Princes' brought to [[France]] from the [[Levant]] is one of the earliest examples of this technique.&lt;ref name="Pinder-Wilson 1991, 135"/&gt; Furthermore, large amounts of raw plant ash were exported solely to [[Venice]], fuelling that city's glass industries.&lt;ref&gt;Jacoby 1993&lt;/ref&gt; It was also in [[Venice]] that enamelling was resurrected following its decline in the Islamic world.&lt;ref name="Gudenrath 2006, 47"/&gt;

==Late Islamic glass: 15th to mid-19th century AD==
The Late Islamic Period is dominated by three main empires and areas of glass production; the [[Ottomans]] in Turkey, the [[Safavid]] (and later the Zand and [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]]) Dynasty in [[Persia]], and the [[Mughals]] in northern [[India]].&lt;ref name="Pinder-Wilson 1991, 136"&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 136&lt;/ref&gt; The most important over-riding characteristic of glass production in this period is the "direct influence of European glass" and, in particular, that of [[Venice]], [[Bohemia]] (in the 18th century), and the Dutch.&lt;ref name="Carboni 2001, 371"&gt;Carboni 2001, 371&lt;/ref&gt; The production of high-quality fine glass essentially ended in Egypt, Syria, and Persia, and it was only in [[India]] during the 17th century that Islamic glass regained a high level of artistic expression following European influence.&lt;ref name="Carboni 2001, 371"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markel 1991, 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of court patronage for glassmaking and the high quality of European glass contributed to a decline in the industry; however, utilitarian glass was still being made in the traditional centres.&lt;ref name="Pinder-Wilson 1991, 136"/&gt;
[[File:BLW Ewers.jpg|thumb|A group of 19th century Persian ewers]]

Historical documents and accounts, such as the ''Surname-i Humayun'', show the presence of glassmaking, and a glassmaker's guild, in [[Istanbul]], as well as production at [[Beykoz]] on the coast of the [[Bosphorus]], in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The glass made at these centres was not of great quality and was highly influenced by Venetian and Bohemian styles and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 137&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Persia]], evidence for glassmaking following the Mongol invasions of the 13th century does not reappear until the [[Safavid]] period (17th century). European travellers wrote accounts of glass factories in [[Shiraz]], and it is thought that transplanted Italian craftsmen brought about this revival.&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 374&lt;/ref&gt; No significant decorative treatments or technical characteristics of glass were introduced or revived during this period in Persia. Bottle and jug forms with simple applied or ribbed decoration, made from coloured transparent glass, were common, and are linked to the Shirazi wine industry.&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 374–375&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mughal (tribe)|Mughal]] glassmaking in India, on the other hand, saw a return to the enamelling and gilding traditions from the Middle Islamic Period, as well as the glass–carving techniques used in Persia during the earliest centuries of the Islamic world.&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 138&lt;/ref&gt; Glass workshops and factories were initially found near the Mughal capital of [[Agra]], Patna (eastern India), and in [[Gujarat]] province (western India), and by the 18th century had spread to other regions in western India.&lt;ref&gt;Markel 1991, 83&lt;/ref&gt; New forms were introduced using these older Islamic glass-working techniques, and of these, ''[[nargileh]]'' (water pipe) bases became the most dominant.&lt;ref&gt;Markel 1991, 84&lt;/ref&gt; Square bottles based on Dutch forms, decorated with enamelling and gilding in Indian motifs, are another important expression in Mughal glassmaking, and were produced at [[Bhuj]], [[Kutch]], and in [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 389&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markel 1991, 87&lt;/ref&gt; Ethnographic study of current glass production in [[Jalesar]] shows fundamental similarities between this site and the Early Islamic tank furnaces found in the [[Levant]], despite differences in the shape of the structures (round in India, rectangular at Bet She'arim), highlighting the technological continuity of the glass industry throughout the Islamic period.&lt;ref&gt;Sode and Kock 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roles of Islamic glass==

While the various functions of Islamic glass have been touched upon during the previous discussion (mosque lamps from the Middle Islamic Period, wine bottles from Safavid Persia, ''[[nargileh]]'' bases from Mughal India), glass filled a multitude of roles throughout the history of the Islamic world. A variety of vessel forms used to hold a wide range of materials make up the bulk of glass objects (bowls, goblets, dishes, perfume bottles, etc.), and have seen the most attention from Islamic glass scholars (Carboni 2001; Israeli 2003; Kröger 1995; Pinder-Wilson 1991; Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001). Some of the more distinct vessel functions from the Islamic period include [[inkwells]] (Israeli 2003, 345), ''qumqum'' or perfume sprinklers,&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 350–351&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israeli 2003, 378-382&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 128–129&lt;/ref&gt; and vessels associated with Islamic science and medicine such as [[alembics]], test-tubes, and cuppers.&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israeli 2003, 347&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kröger 1995, 186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 2001, 56–60&lt;/ref&gt; Glass was also used for aesthetic purposes in the form of decorative figurines,&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Israeli 2003, 383&lt;/ref&gt; and for jewellery as bracelets (Carboni 1994; Spaer 1992) and beads.&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001, 119–123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Spaer 1992, 46"/&gt; The bracelets, in particular, may prove to be an important archaeological tool in the dating of Islamic sites.&lt;ref&gt;Spaer 1992, 54&lt;/ref&gt; Glass also filled various utilitarian roles, with evidence of use as windows,&lt;ref&gt;Kröger 1995, 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001, 61&lt;/ref&gt; and as coin weights.&lt;ref&gt;Schick 1998, 95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Whitehouse 2002, 195&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of functions filled by glass and the sheer bulk of the material found through excavation further highlights its significance as a distinct and highly developed material industry throughout the Islamic world.

==Study of Islamic glass==
Islamic glass from this period has been given relatively little attention by scholars. One exception to this was the work carried out by Carl J. Lamm (1902–1987).&lt;ref&gt;Israeli 2003, 322&lt;/ref&gt; Lamm catalogued and classified the glass finds from important Islamic sites; for example [[Susa]] in Iran (Lamm 1931), and at [[Samarra]] in Iraq (Lamm 1928). One of the most important discoveries in the field of Islamic glass was a shipwreck dated to around 1036 AD on the Turkey coast at Serçe Liman. The recovered cargo included vessel fragments and glass cullet exported from Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson 1991, 114&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of these finds lies in the information they can tell us about the production and distribution of Islamic glass. Despite this, the majority of studies have concentrated on stylistic and decorative classification (Carboni 2001; Kröger 1995; Lamm 1928; Lamm 1931; Scanlon and Pinder-Wilson 2001), and as such technological aspects of the industry, as well as undecorated vessels and objects, have often been overlooked within the field. This, in particular, is frustrating because the majority of glass finds during the Islamic period are undecorated and used for utilitarian purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Carboni 2001, 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lakeland traces its beginnings to German immigrants who, seeking a new life, traveled to America and settled in the Sheboygan area.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2010/02/22/focus24.html|title=Lakeland College|last=|first=|date=21 February 2010|website=www.bizjournals.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here are some milestones in the college’s history:
* In 1862, the founders built Missionshaus (Mission House), a combined academy-college-seminary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The school was called Mission House College and Seminary until 1956 when it adopted the name Lakeland College.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fox11online.com/news/local/lakeshore/lakeland-college-to-be-called-lakeland-university|title=Lakeland College to be called Lakeland University|last=News|first=FOX 11|work=WLUK|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1956, the college adopted the name Lakeland and began focusing on a liberal arts education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The seminary combined with the Yankton Theological School to become United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities and relocated to Minneapolis/St. Paul in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS1773|title=Reformed Churches in Wisconsin {{!}} Wisconsin Historical Society|date=2012-08-03|work=Wisconsin Historical Society|access-date=2018-08-23|language=Sheboygan}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1978, Lakeland launched the state’s first degree-completion program for working adults by offering evening classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hngnews.com/sun_prairie_star/community/article_5f8032d0-f04e-5a7b-b7a7-7d449426148a.html|title=Lakeland College celebrates 30 years of adult education at Madison Center|work=Hometown News LP|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Lakeland’s Evening, Weekend &amp; Online program enrolls more than 2,000 graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/lcmuskies/docs/lakeland-fall-2016|title=Lakeland Fall 2016|work=Issuu|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1991, Lakeland founded a campus in Tokyo, Japan and in 2005 it was recognized as an overseas campus, allowing it to sponsor visas for students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* On July 1, 2016, Lakeland College became Lakeland University. This change resulted in the creation of three schools, a School of Business &amp; Entrepreneurship; a School of Science, Technology &amp; Education; and a School of Humanities and Fine Arts as well as new academic offerings. The change was fueled by many factors, including desire to increase international recruitment and clear up confusion with [[Lakeshore Technical College]], a neighboring institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lakeland.edu/Lakeland-News/lakeland-college-to-become-lakeland-university-on-july-1|title=Lakeland College to become Lakeland University on July 1|website=lakeland.edu|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About Lakeland==

'''Latino studies''' is an academic discipline which studies the experience of people of Hispanic ancestry in the United States. Closely related to other [[ethnic studies]] disciplines such as [[African-American studies]], [[Asian American studies]], and [[Native American studies]], Latino studies critically examines the history, culture, politics, issues, and experiences of [[Hispanic people]]. Drawing from numerous disciplines such as [[sociology]], [[history]], [[literature]], [[political science]], [[religious studies]] and [[gender studies]], Latino studies scholars consider a variety of perspectives and employ diverse analytical tools in their work.

==Origins of Latino studies==
In academia, Latino Studies stemmed from the development of [[Chicana/o studies|Chicana/o Studies]] and Puerto Rican Studies programs in response to demands articulated by [[Student activism|student movements]] in the late 1960s in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aparicio|first=Frances|year=1999|title=Reading the 'Latino' in Latino studies: Toward Re-Imagining Our Academic Location|url=|journal=Discourse|volume= 21| issue =  3|pages=3–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These movements unfolded amid a nationwide climate of heightened social and political [[activism]], incited by opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], the American [[Feminist movement]], and the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At some institutions of [[higher education]] in the United States, the 1970s and 1980s saw the consolidation of Latino Studies as an autonomous discipline while other institutions chose to maintain Chicano and Puerto Rican Studies programs—reflecting a diversity of institutional responses to the nascent academic discipline.

Debates on the academic and institutional location of Latino Studies continue to present day: while some scholars strive to maintain Chicano and Puerto Rican Studies programs that explore the exceptionality of national experiences, in the context of a globalizing [[Latino diaspora]] and diversifying Latino student populations at U.S. universities, many others support the notion of Latino Studies as an "umbrella" field designed to explore pan-Latino experiences and histories that transcend nation-bound analytical frameworks introduced by pioneering Chicano and Puerto Rican studies programs.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cabán|first=Pedro|year=2003|title=From Challenge to Absorption: The Changing Face of Latina and Latino Studies|url=|journal=Centro Journal|volume= 15| issue =  2|pages=126–145|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet others advocate for the absorption of Latino Studies into broader comparative disciplines such as [[ethnic studies]], [[American studies]], and [[Latin American studies|Latin American Studies]]. Accordingly, the status of Latino Studies significantly differs from institution to institution in terms of nomenclature, pedagogical practice, and disciplinary location—with examples ranging from degree-granting autonomous departments to interdisciplinary (and multidisciplinary) programs to university-affiliated research centers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Chicano Studies ===
The first Chicano Studies program was established at [[California State University, Los Angeles]] (CSULA) in Fall 1968 in response to demands articulated by student activism movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.calstatela.edu/academic/cls|title=Department Of Chicana(o) And Latina(o) Studies|last=|first=|date=|website=California State University, Los Angeles|publisher=|access-date=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially named the Mexican American Studies Program, the program was instituted at CSULA as the Chicano Studies Department in 1971. Similar initiatives developed simultaneously at other California universities. In 1969 at a statewide conference held at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], Chicano students, activists and scholars drafted the [[Plan de Santa Bárbara]] a 155-page manifesto for the implementation of Chicano Studies in institutions of higher education in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muñoz Jr.|first=Carlos|year=1992|title=The quest for paradigm: The Development of Chicano Studies and Intellectuals|url=|journal=Latinos and Education: A Critical Reader|volume=|pages=442–443|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[Regents of the University of California]] did not formally adopt the manifesto as an institutional mandate, it served as a blueprint for the establishment of Chicano Studies programs across public universities in the state. However, in calling for the establishment of comprehensive Chicano Studies programs—including departments, research centers, a Chicano studies library—and recommending the adoption of a host of institutional practices, many California universities implemented only certain elements of the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Youth, Identity, and Power: The Chicano Movement|last=Muñoz Jr.|first=Carlos|publisher=Verso|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Chicano studies programs proliferated across campuses in California, Texas-based institutions also played pivotal roles in development of early Chicano Studies programs, including the Center for Mexican American Studies at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 1970 and the Center for Mexican American Studies (CMAS) at the [[University of Texas at Arlington]] founded in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/cmas/about/mission_statement.php|title=Mission Statement|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Texas College of Liberal Arts|publisher=|access-date=January 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Puerto Rican Studies ===
In 1969, a parallel wave of student activism took place at [[City University of New York]] (CUNY) south campus, spearheaded by the efforts of Puerto Rican and African American Students.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Latinas In The United States: A Historical Encyclopedia|last=Ruiz|first=Vicki|last2=Sánchez Korrol|first2=Virginia|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=|isbn=|location=Bloomington and Indianapolis|pages=|chapter=Student Movements (1960s and 1970s)|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts culminated in the spring of 1969 when students staged the Open Admissions Strike. The students' central demand was the adoption of a non-competitive open admissions policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lavin|first=David|last2=Alba|first2=Richard|last3=Silberstein|first3=Richard|year=1979|title=Open Admissions and Equal Access: A Study of Ethnic Groups in the City University of New York|url=|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume= 49| issue =  1|pages=53–92|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expanded admissions policy would, in effect, diversify the student body by guaranteeing placement at CUNY for all New York City high school graduates. In addition to demands for an open-admissions policy, student activists demanded academic programs in Black and Puerto Rican Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Puerto Rican Movement: Voices from the Diaspora|last=Torres|first=Andrés|last2=Velázquez|first2=José Emiliano|publisher=Temple University Press|year=1998|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, CUNY created the Department of Urban and Ethnic Studies. With continuing student activism, the Department of Puerto Rican Studies was formed in 1971, followed by the establishment of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies as a university-based research institute in 1973.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://centropr.hunter.cuny.edu/about/mission-history|title=History|last=|first=|date=|website=Centro de Estudos Puertorriqueños|publisher=City University of New York|access-date=January 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student activism related to the demand for Puerto Rican Studies was not limited to CUNY, and effervesced across New York public campuses including Brooklyn, Lehman, Queens and Bronx Community Colleges.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== New directions in Latino Studies ==
As Chicano and Puerto Rican Studies programs stemmed largely (but not exclusively) from the east and west coasts, institutions in the American Midwest pioneered some of the first academic departments with a multinational or transnational Latino Studies focus. These programs included the Center for Chicano-Boricua Studies at Wayne State University (established in 1972) and the Chicano-Boriqueño Studies Program (now the Latino Studies Program) at Indiana University (established in 1976).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://clas.wayne.edu/cllas/about|title=Latino/A And Latin American Studies - College Of Liberal Arts And Sciences|last=|first=|date=|website=Wayne State University|access-date=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~latino/index.php?page=history|title=Latino Studies At Indiana University, Bloomington|last=|first=|date=|website=Indiana University|access-date=January 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, dozens of universities across the country followed suit and established academic programs and departments (see list of major departments) in Latino Studies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The 1980s and 1990s also saw the emergence of a number of research initiatives and professional societies dedicated to the advancement of a Latino Studies research agenda. These initiatives including fellowships offered by the [[Ford Foundation|Ford]], [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller]], Compton and [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation|Mellon]] Foundations and the establishment of research institutes including The InterUniversity Project on Latino Research, the [[Tomás Rivera Policy Institute]] and the Julian Samora Research Institute.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Debate on the location of Latino Studies within institutions of higher education ==
The location of Latino Studies within institutions of higher education—in terms of disciplinary boundaries, but also with regard to the field's perceived legitimacy as an academic discipline and field of scholarship—is contested.

=== Criticisms of Latino Studies and Ethnic Studies ===
While Latino Studies is sometimes encompassed under the umbrella of ethnic studies, it is important to note that the discipline's course of development in different areas of the United States has been shaped by regional demographics, including the demographic composition of a college campus' student body. In the case of Latino Studies, the American northeast and southwest have served as especially salient battlegrounds for these debates to unfold.

Staunch critics of ethnic studies programs include [[Ward Connerly]], former University of California Regent, who was involved in the successful effort to ban affirmative action in California places of employment and higher education in 1996 with [[California Proposition 209]]. Connerly accused ethnic studies programs of being "divisive" and balkanizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/06/18/us/california-regent-s-new-focus-ethnic-studies.html|title=California Regent's New Focus: Ethnic Studies|last=Bruni|first=Frank|date=1998-06-18|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-16|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Latino Studies faced legal challenges in Arizona with House Bill 2120 which (echoing the [[Arizona ban on ethnic studies]] effectuated in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] public schools in 2011) sought to prohibit public universities in the state from activities and classes including those that "promote division, resentment or social justice toward a race, gender, religion, political affiliation, social class or other class of people"; "are designed primarily for students of a particular ethnic group"; or "advocate solidarity or isolation based on ethnicity, race, religion, gender or social class instead of the treatment of students as individuals." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/53leg/1r/bills/hb2120p.htm|title=HB2120 - 531R - I Ver|website=www.azleg.gov|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; (On January 17, 2017 Arizona House Education Committee Chairman [[Paul Boyer (politician)|Paul Boyer]] denied a hearing, effectively killing the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.12news.com/news/politics/arizona-bill-blocking-ethnic-studies-dies/386899616|title=Arizona bill blocking ethnic studies dies|last=TEGNA|newspaper=KPNX|access-date=2017-02-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

=== Disciplinary positioning of Latino Studies ===
Among scholars and administrators in support of Latino Studies and other ethnic studies programs, opinions are divided on the positioning, status and definition of Latino Studies within institutions of higher education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These debates arise from theoretical and epistemological inquiry but also from concerns surrounding funding and institutional support for university departments and academic programs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the late 1990s, at the height of tensions between nationally-specific programs like Chicano

Studies and Puerto Rican Studies and nascent pan-Latino Studies programs, [[Ignacio M. Garcia|Ignacio Garcia]] (Professor of Western American Studies at [[Brigham Young University]]) advocated for the autonomous departmental status of Chicano Studies—posing the emergence of Latino Studies as a challenge to that ideal.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Chicanas/Chícanos at the Crossroads: Social, Economic, and Political Change|last=Garcia|first=Ignacio|publisher=University of Arizona Press|year=1996|isbn=|editor-last=Maciel|editor-first=David|location=Tucson|pages=|chapter=Juncture in the Road: Chicano Studies since 'El Plan de Santa Barbara.|quote=|editor-last2=Ortiz|editor-first2=Isidro|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1996 essay "Juncture in the Road: Chicano Studies since 'El Plan de Santa Barbara", Garcia argued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many centers find themselves challenged by non- Chicano Latino scholars who want to promote their scholarly interests. They argue that all Latino groups have a common experience with racism and poverty in American society. Also, programs which emphasize the inclusive Hispanic approach are more likely to gain research and support funds more easily. Because immigration has been a major area of study for Chicano Studies and because the immigrant groups are now more diverse among numerous Latino groups, there is an intellectual challenge to Chicano Studies to become inclusive or else to be seen as shallow and exclusionary.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the turn of the 21st century, scholars including [[Frances Aparicio]] (Professor of Spanish and Portuguese and Director of the Latina and Latino Studies Program at [[Northwestern University]]), Pedro Cabán (Professor and Chair of the Department of Latin American, Caribbean &amp; U.S. Latino Studies at [[University at Albany, SUNY|SUNY Albany]]), and [[Juan Flores (professor)|Juan Flores]] (former Professor of Social and Cultural Analysis and Director of Latino Studies at [[New York University]])—argued in support of an interdisciplinary Latino Studies field of scholarship with a transnational focus.

In his 1999 essay "New Concepts, New Contexts," Juan Flores—an advocate for the freestanding autonomy of Latino Studies departments—described the potential "dilution" or "distortion" of the field when subsumed into umbrella departments.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Flores|first=Juan|year=1997|title=Latino Studies: New Contexts, New Concepts|url=|journal=Harvard Educational Review|volume=67| issue =  2|pages=208–221|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flores identified that at a time when many public universities were being consolidated, Latino Studies programs were blossoming at private universities across the country.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Nonetheless, recognizing political and pragmatic concerns, Flores recommended that departmental status should be evaluated on a "case-by-case" basis in order to best place the discipline according to the needs and demands of a particular institutional environment.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Pedro Cabán considered the tensions and contradictions between Latino Studies as a discipline borne from student activism and institutional demands placed upon the discipline, writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If deployed uncritically, the Latino label can result in sanitizing a history of political activism and critical engagement that is the legacy of the struggles of the 1960s ... if Latino Studies programs are to be successful and relevant to legions of students, they will need to retain the normative values that defined their transformative goals, and obtain the academic authority that traditional disciplines possess (hiring, promotion and tenure, curriculum development, discretion over budgets, etc.) &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reflecting upon Latino Studies programs existent in 1999, Aparicio warned that the ideal of interdisciplinarity is often unfulfilled, arguing that Latino Studies programs are often multidisciplinary aggregates of nationally-bounded scholarship: "Latino studies programs are constituted by a list of courses discrete in their national and disciplinary boundaries that add up to ''lo latino''." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Theoretical influences ==
Early Chicano Studies and Puerto Rican Studies programs developed in a parallel fashion: both emerged from activist struggles, developed within nation-bound analytical frameworks and drew influences from economic liberation, antiracism, and critical consciousness theories.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

However, Pedro Cabán argues that the two schools of thought differed in one significant way: "Whereas the Chicano historiography and the emerging social science literature primarily explored the Chicano experience in the US, early Puerto Rican Studies was heavily invested in reinterpreting the economic history of Puerto Rico under US colonial domination." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the 1980s and 1990s, newly formed Latino Studies programs tended to emphasize interdisciplinarity and transnationalism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A number of pre-existing programs were restructured, consolidated or renamed to encompass this broader scope. Scholars in the field have identified the 1990s as a turning point in the discipline's history, as scholarship shifted away from "male-centered nationalistic discourse" and became increasingly influenced by intersectional identity formation theory, including feminist and queer theory.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A '''lead sheet''' is a form of [[musical notation]] that specifies the essential elements of a [[song|popular song]]: the [[melody]], [[lyrics]] and [[harmony]]. The melody is written in [[music notation#Modern notation|modern Western music notation]], the lyric is written as text below the [[musical staff|staff]] and the harmony is specified with [[chord notation|chord symbols]] above the staff.

The lead sheet does not describe the chord [[voicing (music)|voicings]], [[voice leading]], [[bass line]] or other aspects of the [[accompaniment]]. These are specified later by an [[arrangement|arranger]] or [[Musical improvisation|improvised]] by the performers&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', Vol. I, p.76. Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, and are considered aspects of the arrangement or performance of a song, rather than a part of the song itself. 

A lead sheet may also specify an instrumental part or theme, if this is considered essential to the song's identity. For example, the opening [[guitar riff]] from [[Deep Purple]]'s "[[Smoke on the Water]]" is a part of the song; any performance of the song should include the guitar riff, and any imitation of that guitar riff is an imitation of the song. Thus the riff belongs on the lead sheet.

== Performance with lead sheets ==
A lead sheet is often the only form of written music used by a small [[jazz]] ensemble. One or more musicians will play the melody while the rest of the group improvises an appropriate accompaniment based on the [[chord progression]] given in the [[chord symbol]]s, followed by an improvised solo also based on the [[chord progression]]. Similarly, a sufficiently skilled [[jazz]] [[pianist]] should be able to accompany a singer and perform a song by her or himself using only a lead sheet.

Lead sheets are also called '''fake sheets''' and collections of lead sheets are called "[[fake book|fakebooks]]".

== Lead sheet as legal definition of a song ==
The melody, lyrics, and harmony define what a song is. In the [[music industry]] and [[entertainment law]], a lead sheet is the document used to describe a song for legal purposes. For example, a lead sheet is the form of a song to which [[copyright]] is applied—if a [[songwriter]] sues someone for copyright violation, the court will compare lead sheets to determine how much of the song has been copied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Krasilovsky et al. 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Or if a song is considered for an [[Academy Award]] or a [[Grammy]], the song is submitted for consideration in the form of a lead sheet.

The '''National Institute for Space Research''' ({{lang-pt|Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais}}, '''INPE''') is a research unit of the [[Brazil]]ian [[Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (Brazil)|Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation]], whose main goals are fostering scientific research and technological applications and qualifying personnel in the fields of [[Outer space|space]] and [[atmospheric sciences]], [[Aerospace engineering|space engineering]], and [[space technology]]. While INPE is the civilian research center for aerospace activities, the [[Brazilian Air Force]]'s [[Brazilian Aerospace Technical Center (CTA)|General Command for Aerospace Technology]] is the military arm. INPE is located in the city of [[São José dos Campos]], São Paulo.

==History==
On August 3, 1961, [[President of Brazil|President]] [[Jânio Quadros]] signed a decree which created the Organizing Group for the National Commission on Space Activities (COGNAE). This group would give rise to the current National Institute for Space Research.

COGNAE, which shortly after became known as CNAE, started its activities by stimulating, coordinating and supporting studies on [[Outer space|space]] related areas, besides breeding a team of skilled [[researcher]]s and establishing cooperation with leading nations on the space area.

Initially, the research program was developed through its laboratories in [[São José dos Campos]] — still the main campus today. The studies included [[ionosphere]] sounding in the upper atmosphere through devices placed on the ground and mainly through scientific rocket payloads launched from the [[Barreira do Inferno Launch Center]], near [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]].

On April 22, 1971, the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) was created, subordinated to the [[Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico|National Research Council]] (CNPq). Its first Director was the electronic engineer [[Fernando de Mendonça]]. INPE would be the main civilian executive organ for space research development in accordance with the directives of the Brazilian Commission for Space Activities (COBAE), an advisory organ to the President.

Until the mid-seventies, the main projects carried out by INPE included the usage of [[Meteorology|meteorological]], [[Telecommunication|communication]]s and [[earth observation satellite]]s. This engendered other projects such as:

*MESA - reception and interpretation of [[Weather satellite|meteorological satellite]] images;
*SERE - use of satellite [[remote sensing]] technique and aircraft earth resources monitoring
*SACI - that improved the educational system through broadcasting, using a [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] [[communications satellite]].

INPE entered a new era when the Brazilian government approved the [[Brazilian space program|Complete Brazilian Space Mission]] (MECB) at the end of the 1970s. The institute, besides research and applications, started the development of the space technology for specific needs, essential for a country of continental dimensions with immense uninhabited areas.

On March 15, 1985, the Ministry of Science and Technology (MCT) was created and INPE became part of it as an independent organ of the Direct Administration.

During the 1980s, INPE started developing priority programs such as:
* [[Brazilian space program|Complete Brazilian Space Mission]] (MECB),
* [[China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite program]] (CBERS),
* [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] Research Program (AMZ),
* Center for Weather Forecast and Climatic Studies (CPTEC).

It also kept track of other countries' research on the space area, facilitating collaboration and partnership with them. During this period it also established its Integration and Tests Laboratory (LIT) which develops highly specialized activities essential to the Brazilian Space Program.

In the 1990s, the first Brazilian satellite (SCD-1) was launched.

Since 1994, the [[Brazilian Space Agency]] has been responsible for Brazil's [[Space exploration|space program]]. INPE works in close cooperation with the agency.

In 1998, the second Brazilian satellite (SCD-2) was successfully launched, performing even better than the first one. CBERS 1 was launched in 1999, CBERS 2 in 2003 and CBERS 2B in 2007.

'''Open-source appropriate technology''' ('''OSAT''') is [[appropriate technology]] developed through the principles of the [[open-design movement]]. OSAT refers to, on the one hand, technology designed with special consideration to the environmental, ethical, cultural, social, political, and economic aspects of the community it is intended for. On the other hand, OSAT is developed in the open and licensed in such a way as to allow their designs to be used, modified and distributed freely.&lt;ref name="Pearce" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pearce, J. M. (2014). Free and open source appropriate technology. in ''The Routledge Companion to Alternative Organization'', 308. {{ISBN|9780415782265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==
Open source is a development method for [[appropriate technology]] that harnesses the power of distributed peer review and transparency of process. [[appropedia:|Appropedia]] is an example of open-source appropriate technology. There anyone can both learn how to make and use AT free of concerns about patents. At the same time anyone can also add to the collective open-source knowledge base by contributing ideas, observations, experimental data, deployment logs, etc. It has been claimed that the potential for open-source-appropriate technology to drive [[applied sustainability]] is enormous.&lt;ref name="buitenhuis" /&gt; The built in continuous [[peer-review]] can result in better quality, higher reliability, and more flexibility than conventional design/patenting of technologies. The free nature of the knowledge also obviously provides lower costs, particularly for those technologies that do not benefit to a large degree from scale of manufacture. Finally, OSAT also enables the end to predatory intellectual property lock-in. This is particularly important in the context of technology focused on relieving suffering and saving lives in the [[developing world]].

The "open-source" model can act as a driver of [[sustainable development]]. Reasons include:

* It enables localization for communities that do not have the resources to tempt commercial developers to provide local versions of their products. It thus minimizes the need to ship materials over long distances and organizes material activities accordingly;&lt;ref name="hbr.org"&gt;Kostakis, Vasilis. Roos, Andreas. [https://hbr.org/2018/06/new-technologies-wont-reduce-scarcity-but-heres-something-that-might New Technologies Won’t Reduce Scarcity, but Here’s Something That Might]. ''Harvard Business Review'', 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Local manufacturing also makes maintenance easier and also encourages manufacturers to design products to last as long as possible;&lt;ref name="hbr.org"/&gt;
* It can be free as in "gratis" as well as free as in "libre", an important consideration for developing communities.&lt;ref&gt;
 Zelenika and J.M. Pearce, [https://www.academia.edu/9013667/Innovation_Through_Collaboration_Scaling_up_Technological_Solutions_for_Sustainable_Development Innovation Through Collaboration: Scaling up Technological Solutions for Sustainable Development], ''Environment, Development and Sustainability'' 16(6): 1299-1316 (2014). {{doi|10.1007/s10668-014-9528-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the lateral scaling concepts of [[Jeremy Rifkin]].&lt;ref&gt;Rifkin, Jeremy. The zero marginal cost society: The internet of things, the collaborative commons, and the eclipse of capitalism. Macmillan, 2014. {{ISBN|978-1137278463}}&lt;/ref&gt; It thus optimizes the sharing of knowledge and design as there are no patent costs to pay for.&lt;ref name="hbr.org"/&gt;

== Ethical considerations ==

For solutions, many researchers, companies, and academics do work on products meant to assist [[sustainable development]]. [[Vinay Gupta]] has suggested that those developers agree to three principles:&lt;ref name="Gupta" /&gt;

# I will not permit any human being to be deprived of life-giving technology by the profit motive.
# Any works that I patent I will make available to others who are engaged in humanitarian activity for free, except where this would breach other contractual responsibilities.
# I will not use patent law to slow the pace of innovation or service delivery to the needy under any circumstances.

The ethics of information sharing in this context has been explored in depth.&lt;ref&gt;Shea, P. (2014). [http://eprints.qut.edu.au/73133/1/Phillipa_Shea_Thesis.pdf Community arts and appropriate internet technology: participation, materiality, and the ethics of sustainability in the digitally networked era].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bentley, C. M. (2014). [http://www.ejisdc.org/Ojs2/index.php/ejisdc/article/viewFile/1233/510 Exploring information ethics for inclusive open development]. The Electronic Journal of Information Systems in Developing Countries.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Support in the literature ==

* It has been investigated how open sharing of designs, specifications, and technical information can enhance effectiveness, widespread use, and innovation of appropriate technology.&lt;ref name="buitenhuis" /&gt;
* OSAT has been proposed as a new model of enabling innovation for [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name="Zelenika" /&gt;
* OSAT has been claimed to assist in development of medical technology particularly for the developing world.&lt;ref name="Kapczynski" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sali" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinha, S.R. and Barry, M., 2011. Health technologies and innovation in the global health arena. New England Journal of Medicine, 365(9), pp.779-782.&lt;/ref&gt;
* It has been claimed that the sharing of design processes, appropriate tools, and technical information enables more effective and rapid development of appropriate technologies for both industrialized and non-industrialized regions.&lt;ref name="pearce-mushtaq" /&gt; In addition, it is claimed that this sharing will require the appropriate-technology community to adopt open standards/licenses, document knowledge, and build on previous work.&lt;ref name="pearce-mushtaq" /&gt;
* OSAT can be used to generate [[renewable energy]]&lt;ref&gt;Louie H. Experiences in the construction of open source low technology off-grid wind turbines. In2011 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting 2011 Jul 24 (pp. 1-7). IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In education ==

* At the university level, the use of open-source-appropriate technology classroom projects has been shown to be successful in forging  the connection between physics and social benefit:&lt;ref name="Pearce-2" /&gt;  This approach has the potential to use university students' access to resources and testing equipment in furthering the development of appropriate technology. Similarly OSAT has been used as a tool for improving [[service learning]].&lt;ref name="Pearce-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Saleh" /&gt; [[MIT]] has completed a study looking at the usefulness of using [[appropriate technology]] education and its relation to OSAT.&lt;ref name="Grue" /&gt;
* It has been proposed that the evolution of the open-source [[3D printer]]s can enable a new method of development for OSAT&lt;ref name="Villumsen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zelenika-Zovko" /&gt;

==Open source scientific equipment==
* [[Open source hardware]] for science can also be considered OSAT. Hundreds of scientific tools have already been developed and shared. Recently (2014) [[Open Source Lab (book)|open source labs]] have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Pearce, [[Open Source Lab (book)|Open-Source Lab: How to Build Your Own Hardware and Reduce Research Costs]], Elsevier, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation ==
Appropriate technology is designed to promote [[Decentralization|decentralized]], [[labor-intensive]], [[efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] and [[environmentally sound]] businesses.&lt;ref name=BrownU&gt;{{cite book|title=Appropriate Technology: Tools, Choices, and Implications|year=1999|publisher=Academic Press|location=New York|isbn=0-12-335190-1|pages=3, 270|author=Hazeltine, B.|author2=Bull, C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll Pursell says that the movement declined from 1965 to 1985, due to an inability to counter advocates of agribusiness, large private utilities, and multinational construction companies.&lt;ref name="Pursell" /&gt; Recently (2011), several barriers to OSAT deployment have been identified:&lt;ref name="Zelenika-Pearce" /&gt;
* AT seen as inferior or "poor person's" technology
* Technical transferability and robustness of AT
* Insufficient funding
* Weak institutional support
* The challenges of distance and time in tackling rural poverty.

It is a global leader in the field of [[art restoration]] and provides teaching as one of two Italian state conservation schools (the other being the [[Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro]]). The institute maintains also a specialist library and archive of conservation and a museum displaying historic examples of [[Pietra dura|pietre dure]] inlaid semi-precious stones artefacts. A scientific laboratory conducts research and diagnostics and provides a preventive conservation service.

==Origins and early history ==
[[Image:Cathedral Virgin Mary-7.jpg|thumb|Altar decorated in ''[[commesso]]'', (Cathedral of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary (Velika Gospa), [[Dubrovnik]])]]
Being one of the famous artistic workshops of the [[Italian Renaissance]], the Opificio was established in 1588 at the behest of [[Ferdinando I de' Medici]] to provide the elaborate, inlaid precious and semi-precious stoneworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = OPD Museum | url = http://www.firenzemusei.it/00_english/opificio/index.html | accessdate = 2011-02-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110109123911/http://www.firenzemusei.it/00_english/opificio/index.html | archivedate = 2011-01-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the masterpieces of the crafts is the overall decoration of the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze#Cappelle Medicee|Cappella dei Principi]] (Chapel of Princes) in the [[Basilica di San Lorenzo di Firenze]]. The technique, which originated from [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] [[inlay]] work, was perfected by the Opificio masters and the artworks they produced became known as "opera di commessi medicei" (''[[commesso (art technique)|commesso]]'' is the old name of the technique, similar to ancient mosaics) and later as "commesso in pietre dure" (semi-precious stones mosaic).

The artisans performed the exceptionally skilled and delicate task of inlaying thin veneers of semi-precious stones especially selected for their colour, opacity, brilliance and grain to create elaborate decorative and pictorial effects. Items of extraordinary refinement were created in this way, from furnishings to all manner of artworks. Today, artisans trained at the Opificio assist many of the world's museums in their restoration programmes.

The Opificio workshops were originally located in the [[Casino Mediceo. Florence|Casino Mediceo]], then in the [[Uffizi]] and were finally moved to their present location in Via Alfani in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = OPD Museum | url = http://www.firenzemusei.it/00_english/opificio/index.html | accessdate = 2011-02-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110109123911/http://www.firenzemusei.it/00_english/opificio/index.html | archivedate = 2011-01-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the 19th Century the institute's activities moved away from the production of works of art and towards its restoration. At first specialising in [[hardstone carving]], in which the workshops were a world authority, and then later expanding into other related fields (stone and marble sculptures, bronzes, ceramics).

==Recent history==

The second branch of the Institute (baboratori di restauro) had a more modern story. In 1932 [[Ugo Procacci]], the distinghished scholar of Florentine art, in his career as an officer of the Italian Ministry for Cultural Heritage, founded a Laboratory of restoration (original Italian name: ''Gabinetto di restauro'') at the Florence Soprintendenza. It was the first modern restoration laboratory in Italy (pre-dating of 7 years the [[Istituto Superiore per la Conservazione ed il Restauro]] in Rome) and one of the very first ones in all the world.
The Gabinetto di Restauro used scientific methods for the preliminary exhaminition of the works of art (as X radiography) and began an outstanding campaign of restoration on Tuscan Early Masters paintings, that was later known as "restauri di rivelazione" (literally meaning ''revealing restoration'').

&lt;!---[[image:Fortezza lab.jpg|thumb|right|Inside the laboratory at the [[Fortezza da Basso]].]] not at the commons yet---&gt;
In 1966, the fatal tragedy of the [[flood of the River Arno in Florence|flooding of the River Arno]], resulted in many priceless works of art requiring restoration. It provided a significant impetus for expansion of the Gabinetto di restauro's research and restorative services. More space was needed because of the sheer number of artworks which required restoration and also, in some cases, the large size of the pieces themselves, such as the immense 4.48 x 3.9m [[Crucifix (Cimabue, Santa Croce)|Crucifix]] by [[Cimabue]] from the [[Basilica di Santa Croce]]. The expansions provided new laboratories in the [[Fortezza da Basso]]. 
Thanks to financial aid and an influx of expertise from throughout the world, the Florentine Laboratory became, in a short time one of the vanguard restoration laboratories in the world, combining traditional practices with modern technology.

In 1975, the Cultural Heritage Ministry merged the Opificio laboratories with the Gabinetto di restauro (plus other minor Florentine restoration laboratories) and created a new Institute, the modern ''Opificio delle pietre dure''.

Today, the institute is organised in departments specific for the various types of artworks it treats. The laboratories are in three principal venues: in Via Alfani 78, in the historic centre of Florence; in the [[Fortezza da Basso]];  and in [[Palazzo Vecchio]] where restoration treatments on tapestries and textiles are carried out.
There are also several research and services offices.

The actual (updated on march, 26, 2012) Superintendent is  Marco Ciatti.
The Opificio has a board of directors of the departments, under the supervision of the Supertintendent.
It has also a gestional committee and a scientific committee.

===Departments===
*Tapestries and carpets
*Bronzes and ancient weapons
*Wooden sculptures
*Wall painting
*Drawings and prints
*Stoneworks
*Pietre dure mosaics
*Jewelry
*Easel paintings
*Terracotta and potteries
*Textiles

==Museum==
[[Image:Opificio delle pietre dure, ingresso.JPG|thumb]]
The small museum in the Via Alfani displays examples of pietre dure works, including cabinets, table tops and plates, showing an immense repertoire of decoration, usually either flowers, fruits and animals, but also sometimes other picturesque scenes, including a famous view of the [[Piazza della Signoria]]. There is also a large baroque fireplace entirely covered in [[malachite]], a dazzling and brilliant green stone as well as copies of painting executed in inlaid stone. Some of the exhibition space is dedicated to particular types of stone, such as the [[paesina]], extracted near Florence, the grain and colour of which can be used to create vivid landscapes.

An exhibition of the technical processes of pietre dure works through history, can be found on the first floor as well as a large range of finished works dating back to the time of the Medici. There are vases and furnishings decorated with [[Art Nouveau]] designs of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including a tabletop with a harp and garland by [[Emilio Zocchi]] (1849) and another decorated with flowers and birds by [[Niccolò Betti]] (1855).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3263">'''The period eye''' is a concept that was devised by [[Michael Baxandall]] and described in his innovative ''Painting and Experience in Fifteenth-Century Italy: A Primer in the Social History of Pictorial Style'' where he used it to describe the cultural conditions under which art in the [[Renaissance]] was created, viewed, and understood.

==The concept==
Baxandall argued that everyone processes visual information in the brain in a different way, using a combination of innate skills and skills based on experience, which are often culturally determined. He suggested that cultural factors influence the visual characteristics that are attractive at any particular time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~dartfac/features/0102/art.html "In the Eyes of the Beholder" by Tamara Steinert] Dartmouth Faculty Scholarship Today - Features, 2003. Retrieved 23 November 2011.[https://www.webcitation.org/63Q7gHwSO Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt; The period eye examines how artists and their works functioned in their original social, commercial and religious context and has been called an "''...anthropological analysis of a society’s visual culture''." &lt;ref&gt;Langdale, A. (1999) "Aspects of the Critical Reception and Intellectual History of Baxandall's Concept of the Period Eye." in Rifkin, A. (ed.) ''About Michael Baxandall''. Wiley-Blackwell, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; that "''...emphasizes the cultural constructedness of vision...''".&lt;ref&gt;Randolph, A.W. (2004), "Gendering the Period Eye: Deschi da Parto and Renaissance Visual Culture" in ''Art History'', Volume 27, Issue 4, pp. 538-562.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept attempts to  reconstruct the mental and visual equipment brought to bear on works of art in a particular place and time and "''...the social acts and cultural practices that shape attention to visual form within a given culture''." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/inmemoriam/michaeldavidkighleybaxandall.html In Memoriam: Michael David Kighley Baxandall by [[Margaretta M. Lovell]] &amp; Elizabeth Honig.] University of California, 2009. Retrieved 23 November 2011. [https://www.webcitation.org/63QB5axud Archived here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Baxandall developed the concept in greater detail in the case-studies in ''The Limewood Sculptors of Renaissance Germany'' (1980) and ''Patterns of Intention'' (1985).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/2575466/Michael-Baxandall.html "Michael Baxandall" in ''The Telegraph'' 17 August 2008.] Retrieved 22 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7504">The '''political science of religion''' (also referred to as politicology of religion or politology of religion) is one of the youngest disciplines in the [[political science]]s that deals with a study of influence that [[religion]] has on [[politics]] and vice versa with a focus on the relationship between the subjects ([[Actor (policy debate)|actors]]) in politics in the narrow sense: [[government]], [[political parties]], [[pressure group]]s, and [[religious communities]]. It was established in the last decades of the twentieth century.

==Research areas==
The basic research areas of the political science of religion are:
* All aspects of [[religion|religious]] teachings and practices that have direct political contents and messages, such as religious understanding of government, [[Power (sociology)|power]], political [[authority]], [[State (polity)|state]], political organizing, [[war]], [[peace]], etc.;
* All aspects of religious behavior and practice that don’t have direct political contents and messages but do have direct political consequences, such as building of [[Religious architecture|religious edifices]], [[pilgrimage]]s, etc.;
* Attitudes and positions of political subjects in the narrow sense towards religion and religious communities, such as that of [[political party|political parties]] and pressure groups towards religion and religious communities;
* Everything within apparently completely [[secular]] public behavior with no religious motives that causes religious consequences, such as an economic [[monopoly]] achieved by a religious group within a multi-confessional society – it cannot but cause political consequences.

These fields of research are in constant development. The newest area of research in political science of religion is on the subject of religion and international relations.

==History==
The political science of religion or politology of religion was established as an [[academic discipline]] in 1993 at the Faculty of Political Science of the [[University of Belgrade]], [[Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/eng/pages/p_id1/o_p.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210043816/http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/eng/pages/p_id1/o_p.html |archivedate=2010-02-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The  founder of this discipline is Dr Miroljub Jevtic; http://www.fpn.bg.ac.rs/en/undergraduate-studies/political-department/third-year/ . In 2006, [[Georgetown University]] established the [[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] as one of the first American university research centers devoted to issues surrounding the political science of religion.

The ''Politics and Religion Journal'' was founded by the Center for Study of Religion and Religious Tolerance in [[Belgrade, Serbia]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politicsandreligionjournal.com/english/english.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028171212/http://www.politicsandreligionjournal.com/english/english.htm |archivedate=2008-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its ''spiritus movens'' and [[editor in chief]] is [[Miroljub Jevtić]], professor at the Faculty of Political Science, University of Belgrade, Serbia. The journal ''Politics and Religion'', produced by Cambridge Journals, published its first volume in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=RAP Politics and Religion]&lt;/ref&gt;

The political science of religion is studied at almost all universities and political science departments in the United States. The [[American Political Science Association]] has a religion and politics section.&lt;ref&gt;[https://connect.apsanet.org/s11/home/ “Religion and Politics”]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Public engagement''' is a term that has recently been used, particularly in the UK, to describe "the involvement of specialists listening to, developing their understanding of, and interacting with, non-specialists" (as defined by England's university funding agency, [[HEFCE]], in 2006).

==Origins==
The tradition of a decision-making body getting inputs from those with less power is generally known as "consultation". This became popular with UK [[governments]] during the 1980s and 1990s.  Even though most governments that carry out consultations are democratically elected, many people who became involved in these processes were surprised that conduct of such "consultations" was unsatisfactory in at least three respects.

# Groups that already had influence were often the only ones consulted
# People who did not have the resources to find out would usually not be able to be part of a consultation, even if the decision it was meant to influence might have a major impact on them.
# There were no agreed safeguards against consultations being used cynically by decision-makers to make it look like they had sought to canvass other opinions, while in fact having set a new policy in place even before it asked the question.

As early as 1979, science analyst [[Dorothy Nelkin]] pointed out that much of what passed for participation in governance could best be understood as attempts by the powerful to [[co-opt]] the public.

==Theories==
Public engagement is a relatively new term, hardly used before the late 1990s. The existing term it shares most in common with is [[participatory democracy]], discussed by thinkers such as [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[G D H Cole]].

Many see participatory democracy as complementing [[representative democratic]] systems, in that it puts decision-making powers more directly in the hands of ordinary people. Rousseau suggested that participatory approaches to democracy had the advantage of demonstrating that "no citizen is a master of another" and that, in society, "all of us are equally dependent on our fellow citizens". Rousseau suggested that participation in decision – making increases feeling among individual citizens that they belong in their community.  Perhaps the most long-standing institution of participatory democracy is the system of trial by jury.

Whilst elected governments make the laws, it is therefore juries that are able to decide the innocence or guilt of anyone charged with breaking many of those laws, making it a key instrument of participatory democracy. Over the centuries they have achieved an importance to many democracies that have had to be fiercely defended. One senior judge surveying the limiting of a government's power provided by the jury over the centuries compared the jury to: "a little parliament... No tyrant could afford to leave a subject's freedom in the hands of twelve of his countrymen.... Trial by jury is more than an instrument of justice and more than one wheel of the constitution: it is the lamp that shows that freedom lives". ([[Patrick Devlin, Baron Devlin|Patrick Devlin]] 1956). Today, jury trials are practised in the UK, US, and many other democracies around the world including Russia, Spain, Brazil and Australia. Perhaps no other institution of government rivals the jury in placing power so directly in the hands of citizens, or wagers more on the truth of democracy's core claim that the people make their own best governors. Juries are therefore argued to be the most widespread form of genuine consultation at work in society today.

The tension between the state and civil society as underscored by Public Engagement within Newly Industrialized Economies (NIE) such as Singapore is illustrated by Kenneth Paul Tan of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|title=Public Engagement: The Gap between Rhetoric and Practice|url=https://www.cscollege.gov.sg/Knowledge/Ethos/Issue%2011%20August%202012/Pages/Public%20Engagement%20The%20Gap%20between%20Rhetoric%20and%20Practice.aspx|website=Civil Service College of Singapore|accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''But speaking about public engagement is, of course, quite a different thing from carrying out public engagement. And this is where there seems to be a gap between rhetoric and practice in Singapore. For instance, government officials recently met selectively with concerned members of the public to discuss a controversial decision to build a road through a historically significant graveyard. When criticised for not taking the public's views seriously, the Government explained that the meeting was never meant to be a "consultation". So it is important to ask why such a gap exists and why it might be difficult to close it, assuming of course that closing it is what we want to do."

''As a neo-liberal global city, Singapore has been witnessing rising popular pressure. Politics has come to the fore again, prompting the policy establishment to pay greater heed to the demands of a new and more variegated citizenry, with political leaders now more sensitive to the real prospect of losing elections. At the same time, the cultural, ideological, practical and institutional legacies of the earlier survivalist and development stages continue to be a source of tension in the evolution of Singapore's political culture. By no means has this been a simple and linear story of liberalisation.
However, are these recent developments enough to shift the deeply entrenched public sector mindsets that have been formed out of historically shaped ways of thinking and reasoning? Will a new generation of leaders in the public sector, whose horizons of experience may differ from the survivalist and developmental preoccupations of a previous generation, lead to fresh opportunities for new terms of engagement?''

''The elitist proclivities of the public sector, reinforced by top-level salaries that are comparable to the private sector, are unlikely to incentivise real public engagement, since they reinforce the sense that public sector leaders, possessing superior intellect, knowledge and insight, must defend the public interest against irrational and dangerous mass populism. The public, according to this mindset, needs to be educated to think correctly rather than present themselves as equal participants in policy formulation and implementation.
''

==Good practice==
Taking participatory democracy as an ideal for public engagement has significant consequences for how we apply the concept to issues with a scientific or technical element. Instead of merely receiving inputs from various interested parties, a participatory model of consultation forces decision-makers to recognise the democratic accountability of their actions not merely every few years at elections, but in a more systematic, direct sense to citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomfield, D., Collins, K., Fry, C. and Munton, R., 2001: [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.459.23&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf Deliberation and inclusion: vehicles for increasing trust in UK public governance?] Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy 19, 501-513&lt;/ref&gt;

A common misconception is that there is a particular ''[[methodology]]'' that can be devised to facilitate all public engagement. Effective participation, by contrast, is conducted on the assumption that each different situation will require a different design, using a new combination of tools as part of an evolving cycle of action and reflection by the institution involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Measham | first1 = T.G. Brake | last2 = Robinson | first2 = C.J | last3 = Larson | first3 = S. Richards | last4 = Smith | first4 = T. | year = 2011 | title = NRM engagement between remote arid communities and government agencies: Success factors from Australia | url = | journal = Journal of Arid Environments | volume =  75| issue = | pages =  968–973| doi = 10.1016/j.jaridenv.2011.04.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each "experiment" in participatory democracy contains a unique mix of people and institutions. Each method must therefore select elements from a range of different approaches.&lt;ref&gt;There are a number of organizations, like California's Institute for Local Government, that provide public officials with analytic constructs to decide which approaches to use and evaluate the results.  See, [http://www.ca-ilg.org/PublicEngagement www.ca-ilg.org/publicengagement.]&lt;/ref&gt; Participation is also overtly "political" in that it is about humans, power and knowledge – all of which are inherently complex and which together make for a potent mix that requires sensitivity and careful planning. So while participatory processes can be replicated in the same way as scientific protocols, their human ingredients can differ so much that a concentration on replicating what happened elsewhere often hinders the practical application of a technique.

Before describing a scientific experiment, scientists know that it is vital to explain the context in which that experiment takes place. Was the plant in a test tube or in a farmer's field?  Was the rat well fed or starving? This logic also applies in the case of a participatory process, in which the each consultation event is analogous to an experimental subject. Each needs to proceed from an understanding of its political, scientific, institutional and practical constraints.

So instead of recommending a perfect method of public engagement, Table 1 summarises some working principles for such processes, based on those used by [[Policy, Ethics and Life Sciences Research Centre|PEALS]] at [[Newcastle University]].

==Nine principles==
#Participants should join those organising the process in setting [[terms of reference]] for the whole exercise, and framing the questions that they will discuss.
#The group organising, or in overall control of, the process should be broad based, including stakeholders with different interests on the subject being discussed.
#There should be a diversity of [[information]] sources and perspectives available to participants.
#There should be space for the perspectives of those participants who lack specialist knowledge of the area concerned to engage in a two-way exchange with those possessing specialist knowledge.
#There should be complete [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]] of the activities carried out within the process to those both inside and outside it.
#Those without a voice in policy-making should be enabled to use the consultation process as a tool for positive [[political change]]. This should be embedded in the process by sufficient funds being made available for follow-up work after their initial conclusions have been reached.
#The process should contain safeguards against decision-makers using a process to [[legitimise]] existing assumptions or policies.
#All groups involved in the process should be given the opportunity to identify possible strategies for longer-term learning, development and change on a range of issues relating to their conclusions.
#The group organising, or in overall control of, the process should develop an [[audit]] trail through the process, to explain whether policies were changed, what was taken into account, what criteria were applied when weighing up the evidence from the process, and therefore how the views of those involved in the participatory process may have made a difference. This should be explored together with as many those involved in all levels of the process as possible.

==In science and technology==
The movement for public engagement in science and technology grows out of a paradox: the steadily increasing number of ways citizens can learn about science has not always been matched by any increased level of scientific knowledge or sophistication among citizens.  There are nearly one hundred science and technology museums in North America alone, numerous science blogs (the aggregation site, [[ScienceBlogs]], reported 152 thousand posts and 3.3 million comments for 61 blogs alone before it closed in October 2017), and a proliferating number of science magazines.&lt;ref&gt;ScienceBlogs. (n.d.). ScienceBlogs. Retrieved November 13, 2011, from http://scienceblogs.com/&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, surveys of scientific literacy show a long term pattern in which Americans have only a moderate understanding of basic scientific facts and concepts.  In 1992, only 59% of adults sampled could give correct answers to a series of scientific terms and concepts; in 2008 the number was 64%.&lt;ref&gt;nsf.gov - S&amp;E Indicators 2010 - Chapter 7.  Science and Technology: Public Attitudes and Understanding - Public Knowledge About S&amp;T - US National Science Foundation (NSF).

Retrieved November 12, 2011, from {{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind10/c7/c7s2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001164010/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind10/c7/c7s2.htm |archivedate=2011-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2010 the presentation of these same measures of [[scientific literacy]] became controversial. Americans performed much worse on questions about [[evolution]] and the [[big bang]] theory than respondents from different countries. These differences disappeared when short caveats like, "According to the theory of Evolution..." were added to the questions – pointing to a larger conflict between scientific knowledge and personal beliefs in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bhattacharjee | first1 = Y. | year = 2010 | title = NSF board draws flak for dropping evolution from Indicators. | url = http://science.sciencemag.org/content/328/5975/150.short | journal = Science | volume = 328 | issue = 5975| page = 150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another survey found widening gaps in knowledge of [[nanotechnology]] between the most and least educated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Corley | first1 = E.

To address this disconnect and complexity, there have been calls for new ways of connecting citizens with science in hopes that citizens can do more than respond passively to choices made by experts, and instead actually contribute to shaping science policy as it is made. This engagement of different publics in the policymaking process happens through the flow of information between the relevant publics and the sponsor of the engagement (e.g., policy makers, experts, scientists). Mechanisms for public engagement generally fall within one of the following types of information flow; public communication, public consultation, and public participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guidry | first1 = Jeanine P.D. | last2 = Jin | first2 = Yan | last3 = Orr | first3 = Caroline A. | last4 = Messner | first4 = Marcus | last5 = Meganck | first5 = Shana | year = 2017 | title = Ebola on Instagram and Twitter: How health organizations address the health crisis in their social media engagement. | url = | journal = Public Relations Review | volume = 43 | issue = | page = 477-486 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''Public communication''' is characterized by the one-way transfer of information or resources to the public. This includes mechanisms like information broadcasts and static website resources. Traditional media functions in this way by influencing the public agenda, termed [[agenda-setting theory]]. '''Public consultation''' is the collection of information about or from the public by the sponsor. Potential mechanisms are [[opinion poll]]s, [[referendum]], [[survey (human research)|surveys]], [[focus groups]], or interactive websites. These mechanisms gather information from the public to shape what sponsors focus on or invest their resources into. Public consultation is also a one-way flow of information, but in the reverse direction of public communication.

'''Public participation''' is the two-way dialogue between the public and the sponsor. This two-way dialogue can be either short-term, with brief exchanges of information, or long-term, lasting decades. Mechanisms for public participation include action planning workshops, citizens' jury, consensus conferences, and task forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rowe | first1 = G. | last2 = Frewer | first2 = L. J. | year = 2005 | title = A typology of public engagement mechanisms. | url = http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.546.7172&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf | journal = Science Technology &amp; Human Values | volume = 30 | issue = 2| page = 251 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Social media has become an increasingly prominent mechanism of public participation as well. Social allows for instant and on-going dialogue between sponsors and the public. Additionally, social is flexible and can be implemented in a variety of ways, but not all social media platforms function identically. For example, three major health organizations implemented social media campaigns during the Ebola epidemic of 2013: [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), and [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF, also known as Doctors without Borders). All three organizations used both Twitter and Instagram to communicate with the public, but the public engaged with Instagram posts more often than Twitter. This finding is consistent with [[Visual communication]] theory. Additionally, each organization fostered a different level of engagement with the public (MSF garnered the highest engagement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jeanine P.D.|first1=Guidry|last2=Jin|first2=Yan|last3=Orr|first3=Caroline A.|last4=Messner|first4=Marcus|last5=Meganck|first5=Shana|title=Ebola on Instagram and Twitter: How health organizations address the health crisis in their social media engagement|journal=Public Relations Review|date=2017|volume=43|page=477-486||doi=10.1016/j.pubrev.2017.04.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deliberative democracy'''

[[Deliberative democracy]] is also a mechanism for public participation with potential implications for public engagement with science. It provides a structure for public participation about pending policy developments via public hearings, the mainstream media and the internet, consulting with different interest groups. This way, policy in the making is informed by the knowledge and experiences of those who will be affected by it, works to engage the public before final decisions are made, and sometimes gives affected groups a share of power in policy developments.&lt;ref&gt;Lukensmeyer, C. J., &amp; Torres, L. H. (n.d.). Public Deliberation: A Manager's Guide to Citizen Engagement | IBM Center for the Business of Government. IBM Center for the Business of Government: Research, Trends, Reports. Retrieved November 14, 2011, from http://www.businessofgovernment.org/report/public-deliberation-managers-guide-citizen-engagement&lt;/ref&gt;

Stages 1 and 2 can use tools like public opinion surveys, media campaigns and public hearings.  Stages 3 and 4 involve public or online deliberation or multi-stakeholder negotiation aimed at consensus building. Government decision makers at the agencies involved are expected to know their objectives and rationales, as well as key challenges to engaging the public.

In such situations, agencies must be on guard to see that all the important views are represented without raising expectations so high that all participants think their views will automatically be adopted as policy. Moreover, evaluation to ensure the effectiveness of public engagement is also important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jensen | first1 = E | year = 2011 | title = 'Evaluate impact of communication' | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = | page = 162 | doi = 10.1038/469162c}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Key examples of public engagement''' include:

* Americans Discuss Social Security, which engaged 50,000 Americans in all fifty states over fifteen months in 1998 and 1999.  During that period, President Clinton and 120 members of Congress took part in town meetings and teleconferences.  The project's sponsors state that it "demonstrated the intense public interest in the future of Social Security reform and showed that Americans had more of a "middle ground" approach than special interests or lawmakers had believed. For example, contrary to insiders' expectations, participants overwhelmingly supported raising the cap on payroll taxes."&lt;ref&gt;Americans Discuss Social Security «  AmericaSpeaks. (n.d.).

* Listening To The City, which brought 5,000 people from New York City and the tri-state area to the Javits Center in July 2002, to discuss the future of lower Manhattan.  A separate series of 26 online dialogues involved an additional 800 participants over two weeks.  The purpose was to insure broad participation in redevelopment of the World Trade Center site and listen to citizens' ideas about the proposed memorial.  According to the final report, 80% of participants were satisfied or very satisfied with the result.&lt;ref&gt;Listening to the City. (n.d.). Listening to the City.

* Voices &amp; Choices, a 16-county civic engagement process aimed at involving citizens in the economic future of northeast Ohio in 2008.  Major agenda items included school funding, government fragmentation and inefficiency, racial isolation and inequalities and creating a competitive workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Voices &amp; choices Report On The Public's Priorities For Northeast Ohio's Future.

This included one-on-one interviews with three thousand people as well as eleven workshops attended by 15,000 more people.  Nine hundred citizens took part in an additional town meeting aimed at identifying goals the region needed to adopt to overcome its most significant challenges.  There were also leadership workshops for 1000 government and business leaders.  The three top goals that emerged were  planning for the future development and growth of the region, ensuring students have the financial resources they need to succeed, and improving workforce training programs.  90% of regional town meeting participants described them as excellent or good. (www.futurefundneo.org/~/media/Final_VoicesChoices_Report.ashx)

Public engagement with science was formally called for in the Third Report of the UK House of Lords Committee on Science and Technology, which argued that "public confidence in science and policy based on science has been eroded in recent year....there is a new humility on the part of science in the face of public attitudes, and a new assertiveness on the part of the public."  One consultation, on the regulation of biotechnology in 1998, involved six two-day workshops as well as a large-scale survey.  Asked who should be involved in regulating biotechnology, between 40 and 50 percent of respondents said regulatory groups should include a mixed advisory body, an expert body, scientists themselves, the general public, government, and environmental groups.  One advisor to the Office of Science and Technology said the process was time-consuming and expensive, and workshops were open to the charge of being run by their organizers rather than their participants, but he still felt the participants dealt with the issues and came to understand them.&lt;ref&gt;Select Committee on Science and Technology Third Report CHAPTER 5: ENGAGING THE PUBLIC .

&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are important obstacles facing public engagement strategies. [[Selective exposure theory]] postulates that individuals favor information that agrees with their beliefs over information that contradicts those beliefs. Experimental evidence supports this theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yeo|first1=Sara K.|last2=Xenos|first2=Michael A.|last3=Brossard|first3=Dominque|last4=Scheufele|first4=Dietram A.|title=Selecting our own science: How communication contexts and individual traits shape information seeking|journal=The annals of the american academy|date=March 2015|volume=658|pages=172-191|doi=10.1177/0002716214557782}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals also form a [[filter bubble]] of like-minded people who hold a similar belief structure, decreasing the amount of dissonant information they are likely to encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pariser|first1=Eli|title=The Filter Bubble: What the Internet Is Hiding from You|date=May 2011|publisher=Penguin Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59420-300-8|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sponsors and communicators need to address or counter these obstacles when trying to engage with the public.

==Constraints of public meeting efforts==

The following intrinsic and extrinsic constraints of public meetings can lead to unexpected a misrepresentation of the overall public's opinions:

'''1. Attendance in public meetings is low and highly selective'''

Although citizens express their intention to participate in public engagement activities, in real world, they are less likely to show up. For example, the average turnout at annual town meetings in Massachusetts in 1996 was 7.6 percent which was much lower than the average municipal election turnout of 31.1 percent.&lt;ref&gt;de Santis, V. S., and T. Renner. 1997. Democratic traditions in New England town meetings: Myths and realities. In Annual Convention of the Midwest Political Science Association. Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt; Low turnout rate in public meetings can lead serious sampling biases when attendees and non-attendees significantly differ in their interests. For example, attendees can be more interested in politics and involved in more personal discourses than non-attendees. In this case, their opinions can be slanted to one side.

'''2. Group dynamics and personality traits of participants'''

Depending the makeup of participants, group dynamics and personality characteristics of participants can considerably affect the outcomes of discussions. A small number of outspoken participants can make more than half of the comments during the discussions while least outspoken members make a very small portion of the comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Merkle | first1 = D. M. | year = 1996 | title = The polls-Review-The National Issues Convention Deliberative Poll | url = | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 60 | issue = 4| pages = 588–619 | doi=10.1086/297775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''3. Moderated/controlled settings of public meetings'''
In order to minimize the potential effects of participants' demographic and cognitive characteristics on conversations, public meetings or consensus conferences tend to be carefully moderated and guided by facilitators. In such artificial setting, participants may behave in different ways that may differ from what is likely to occur in real-world discussions.&lt;ref&gt;Scheufele, A. D. (2011). Modern  Citizenship  or  Policy  Dead  End?  Evaluating  the  need  for  public  participation  in  science  policy  making,  and  why  public  meetings  may  not  be  the  answer . Paper #R-34, Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy Research Paper Series. Havard University. Cambridge, MA. Retrieved from http://www.hks.harvard.edu/presspol/publications/papers/research_papers/r34_scheufele.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

'''4. Spillovers from public meetings to real-world discussion'''

The social implication effect of follow-up media coverage of public meetings or other engaging events may help transfer issues from these small group discussions to the broader community. However, in the case of the U.S., a spillover effect from public meetings into media discourse are minimal at best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dudo | first1 = A. D. | last2 = Dunwoody | first2 = S. | last3 = Scheufele | first3 = D. A. | year = 2011 | title = The emergence of nano news: Tracking thematic trends and changes in U.S. newspaper coverage of nanotechnology | url = http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/107769901108800104 | journal = Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly | volume = 88 | issue = 1| pages = 55–75 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''5. Knowledge gap issues'''

Public meetings and consensus conferences may create knowledge gaps between high SES and less SES participants. The demographic, prepositional and cognitive differences between two groups in public meeting may lead to differing outcomes of public engagement. For example, highly educated participants may learn more from discussions and dominate the conversation while less educated members listen to their arguments. Furthermore, only small proportions of the population who may be already informed attend public meetings while the majority of the population who may need information the most do not. In such case, any public engagement effort may widen existing gaps further.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2478">'''Renato Treves''' (1907–1992) was born in [[Turin]], [[Italy]] of a Jewish family. According to [[Vincenzo Ferrari]], Treves "devoted his first academic study to the diffusion of Claude Henri de Saint-Simon's (1760-1825) doctrines in Italy" before turning his attention to the [[neo-Kantian]] movement and [[Hans Kelsen]]'s [[Pure Theory of Law]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferrari 2007: 1520.&lt;/ref&gt;

Treves also exerted considerable influence on the development of the [[sociology of law]] in Italy and is one of the founders of the [[Research Committee on Sociology of Law]].

Renato Treves kept faith with a Weberian and Kelsenian vision of sociology of law, as distinct from legal science. He advocated empirical research as a means of testing theories critically and favoured open as opposed to closed social portraits of law. Primarily, he argued in favour of a perspectivist and relativistic vision of law and society, combating all kinds of absolutism in both science and politics, from a liberal socialist stance that he upheld in many of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrari 2007: 1521.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report developed under the leadership of [[Ottmar Edenhofer]] evaluates the global potential for using [[renewable energy]] to [[Climate change mitigation|mitigate climate change]]. This IPCC special report provides broader coverage of renewable energy than was included in the IPCC’s 2007 climate change assessment report, as well as stronger [[renewable energy policy]] coverage.&lt;ref name=ren212011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ren21.net/Portals/97/documents/GSR/GSR2011_Master18.pdf |title=Renewables 2011: Global Status Report |author=[[REN21]] |year=2011 |page=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renewable energy can contribute to "social and economic development, energy access, secure energy supply, climate change mitigation, and the reduction of negative environmental and health impacts". Under favourable circumstances, cost savings in comparison to non-renewable energy use exist.&lt;ref name="ipcc_sren"/&gt;

== History ==
Previously the IPCC examined both renewable energy and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in its [[fourth assessment report]], published in 2007, but members decided that [[renewable energy commercialization]] merits additional in-depth coverage because of its importance in reducing [[carbon emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/meetings/session28/doc3.pdf  Scoping Paper: IPCC Special Report]&lt;/ref&gt;

The outline of the IPCC WG III’s Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) was approved at the IPCC Plenary in Budapest in April, 2008. The final report was approved at the 11th session of the IPCC Working Group III, May 2011, in Abu Dhabi. The SRREN addresses the information needs of policy makers, private sector and civil society in a comprehensive way and will provide valuable information for further IPCC publications, including the upcoming IPCC 5th Assessment Report.  The SRREN was released for publication on May 9, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/ Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Special Report "aims to provide a better understanding and broader information on the mitigation potential of renewable energy sources: technological feasibility, economic potential and market status, economic and environmental costs&amp;benefits, impacts on energy security, co-benefits in achieving sustainable development, opportunities and synergies, options and constraints for integration into the energy supply systems and in the societies".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/activities/activities.htm IPCC Activities]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main findings==
Renewable energy can contribute to "social and economic development, energy access, secure energy supply, climate change mitigation, and the reduction of negative environmental and health impacts".&lt;ref name="ipcc_sren"/&gt;

In the report, the IPCC said "as infrastructure and energy systems develop, in spite of the complexities, there are few, if any, fundamental technological limits to integrating a portfolio of renewable energy technologies to meet a majority share of total energy demand in locations where suitable renewable resources exist or can be supplied".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |year=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, United States |page=17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under favourable circumstances, cost savings in comparison to non-renewable energy use exist.&lt;ref name="ipcc_sren"/&gt; IPCC scenarios "generally indicate that growth in renewable energy will be widespread around the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://srren.ipcc-wg3.de/report/IPCC_SRREN_SPM.pdf |title=Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation |author=IPCC |year=2011 |work=Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, United Kingdom and New York, NY, United States |page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC said that if governments were supportive, and the full range of renewable technologies were deployed, renewable energy could account for almost 80% of the world's energy supply within four decades.&lt;ref name=ipccccc/&gt; [[Rajendra Pachauri]], chairman of the IPCC, said the necessary investment in renewables would cost only about 1% of global GDP annually. This approach could keep greenhouse gas concentrations to less than 450 parts per million, the safe level beyond which climate change becomes catastrophic and irreversible.&lt;ref name=ipccccc&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/09/ipcc-renewable-energy-power-world |title=Renewable energy can power the world, says landmark IPCC study |author=Fiona Harvey |date=9 May 2011  |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Research Centre in Cairo, Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw,''' (Polish: ''Stacja Badawcza Centrum Archeologii Śródziemnomorskiej Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego w Kairze'', Arabic: مركز البحوث بالقاهرة، المركز البولندي لآثار منطقة البحر الأبيض المتوسط جامعة وارسو, ''Markaz al-Bohouth bi Al-Qahira, Al-Markaz al-Bulandi lil-Athar Mintaqat al-Bahr al-Abyad al-Mutawassit Jami’at Warsu'') is the only Polish scientific research institution in [[Africa]] and the [[Middle East]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://naukawpolsce.pap.pl/aktualnosci/news,406092,nowy-dyrektor-jedynej-polskiej-placowki-naukowej-w-afryce-i-na-bliskim-wschodzie.html|title=Nowy dyrektor jedynej polskiej placówki naukowej w Afryce i na Bliskim Wschodzie|last=Zdziebłowski|first=Szymon|date=11 August 2015|work=Nauka w Polsce|access-date=2017-06-25|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it has operated since 1959 in [[Cairo]]. The mission of the Research Centre is to develop and expand Polish research in the region, particularly in [[Nile|the Nile Valley]]. It is operated by the [[Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology]], an independent research institute of the [[University of Warsaw]]. The PCMA Cairo Research Centre is located in two buildings situated in close proximity to one another in the Cairo [[Heliopolis (ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] district — in antiquity the centre of a religious cult and the location of the Egypt's reputedly largest temple.

== History ==
Polish archaeologists first started to work in [[Egypt]] during the times of the [[Second Polish Republic]] (1918-1939). [[Kazimierz Michałowski]], the founder of the Polish school of Mediterranean archaeology, initiated Polish research in Egypt, and joined as a field director a project of the [[Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale|French Institute for Oriental Archaeology]] in Cairo (IFAO) at [[Edfu]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Od Edfu do Faras|last=Michałowski|first=Kazimierz|publisher=Wydawnictwa Artystyczne i Filmowe|year=1983|isbn=|location=Warsaw|pages=10, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The excavation was suspended after three seasons because of the outbreak of [[World War II|WWII]]. Twenty years later, despite the tense political situation in the Middle East, Polish archaeologists were back in Egypt. In 1956, they were granted a concession to explore [[Athribis|Tell Atrib]] in the suburbs of [[Banha|Benha]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcma.uw.edu.pl/pl/wydarzenia/niepodpiete/stulecie-urodzin-k-michalowskiego/|title=Profesor Kazimierz Michałowski i polska szkoła archeologii śródziemnomorskiej|last=Pawlicki|first=Franciszek|date=|website=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; but work did not begin until a year later due to the [[Suez Crisis]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=50 lat polskich wykopalisk w Egipcie i na Bliskim Wschodzie|last=Daszewski|first=Wiktor Andrzej|publisher=|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=25 lat istnienia Stacji Archeologii Śródziemnomorskiej Uniwersytetu Warszawskiego}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959 Professor Michałowski established the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology of the University of Warsaw in Cairo, which is still operated today under the name Research Center in Cairo.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Polish archaeologists facing new archaeological tasks, such as coordination of new research, preparing for publication the results of the excavations, contributing to the international [[UNESCO]] campaign to save [[Nubia]]n archaeological heritage, greatly benefitted from having a permanent location in Egypt&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1960 Polish archaeologists began excavations in [[Alexandria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventy Years of Polish Archaeology in Egypt|last=Kiss|first=Zolt|publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=117|chapter=Alexandria. Past research}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961–1964, led by Michałowski, they became an important part of the UNESCO campaign to save the archaeological heritage of [[Nubia]], which was to be inundated by the waters of the newly created artificial [[Lake Nasser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://culture.pl/pl/artykul/skarby-faras-ukryte-w-piaskach-pustyni|title=Skarby Faras ukryte w piaskach pustyni|last=Sural|first=Agnieszka|date=|website=culture.pl|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''"Poles hit the Nubian lottery jackpot",'' reported the international press about the Polish discoveries at [[Faras]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Even as the first season of excavation at Faras was in full swing, Michałowski was approached by the Egyptian authorities to take on the task of completing the restoration of the Upper Terrace of the [[Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut|Temple of Hatshepsut]] in [[Luxor]]. The work in [[Deir el-Bahari]] began in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventy Years of Polish Archaeology in Egypt|last=Szafrański|first=Zbigniew|publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=93|chapter=Deir el-Bahari. Temple of Hatshepsut}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Michałowski headed the international committee of experts created by the Egyptian government to rescue the [[Abu Simbel temples|rock temples of Abu Simbel]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The Polish Centre in Cairo was named after its founder by the Senate of the [[University of Warsaw]] on 21 December 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=50 lat polskich wykopalisk w Egipcie i na Bliskim Wschodzie|last=Białkowski|first=Grzegorz|publisher=|year=1986|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Wstęp}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its establishment and development into a reputed international archaeological institution is considered among his greatest achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sadurska|first=Anna|date=1981|title=Nekrologi|url=|journal=Archaeologia|volume=32|pages=244|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After all, "''the current level of culture in any country is measured by whether it runs its own excavations in Egypt,"'' Michałowski used to say.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 1980s saw a rapid development of archaeological research with the opening of new sites in Egypt as well as in other countries of the Middle East. This resulted in an administrative reorganization in 1986. The head office was moved to Warsaw, establishing the [[Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology]] of the University of Warsaw in Warsaw in charge of supervising the Research Centre in Cairo as its main branch, as well as all the Polish archaeological missions in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Near East and Northeastern Africa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2017, there was a dozen or so Polish archaeological missions working in Egypt. Every year several hundred Polish researchers of different specialties, not only archaeologists, from different Polish and foreign scientific institutions participate in research in Egypt.

== Objectives ==
The objectives of the Research Centre in Cairo are as follows:
* to ensure the efficient progress of archaeological and restoration work carried out by Polish missions in Egypt;
* to represent Polish researchers, archaeologists and conservators, to the Egyptian authorities responsible for antiquities, most of all the Ministry of Antiquities, as well as to other archaeological units in Egypt;
* to develop and popularize knowledge, by organizing public lectures and seminars presenting archaeological research in Egypt and Polish achievements in this field, as well as running a reference library allowing the Centre's residents and visitors to access to publications on archaeology and history of the Middle East;
* to provide support for a scholarship program of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education of the Republic of Poland, granted to students, graduates and PhD candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcma.uw.edu.pl/pl/stacja-badawcza-w-kairze/|title=Stacja Badawcze w Kairze|last=|first=|date=|website=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005 the Research Center in Cairo has its own Director, subordinated to the Director of the Polish Centre in Warsaw. This office has been held by:
* [[Zbigniew Szafrański|Zbigniew E. Szafrański]] (2005–2015)
* Artur Obłuski (2015 –).

== Polish archaeological missions in Egypt ==
* Polish-Egyptian Archaeological and Conservation Mission at Kom el-Dikka in [[Alexandria]], since 1960. One of the main quarters of the ancient city located in the center of the modern town is among the greatest discoveries of Polish archaeologists in Egypt. Preserving non-stop occupation from the city's founding in the 3rd century BC through the medieval 13th- – 14th-century Islamic burial ground, the site that is visited today as an archaeological park open to tourists encompasses buildings from the 4th through 6th centuries AD, including the oldest known ruins of an institution of higher learning (Alexandria's ancient academy) composed of lecture halls, an assembly hall vel theater or rather odeon, a late Roman imperial bathhouse and a habitation quarter of houses and workshops. Kom el-Dikka is the largest and the most important archaeological site in Alexandria. It was discovered by chance&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; when a high-rise construction project turned up wall remains identified by Polish archaeologists called in to consult the finds, as Egypt's only surviving Roman-age theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sca-egypt.org/eng/SITE_Alexandria_Theater.htm|title=Alexandria Amphitheater (Kom el-Dikka)|last=|first=|date=|website=Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Polish Archaeological Mission at [[Marina, Egypt|Marina el-Alamein]], excavating an ancient [[Graeco-Roman]] town and necropolis since 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventy Years of Polish Archaeology in Egypt|last=Daszewski|first=Wiktor Andrzej|publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=147|chapter=Marina el-Alamein}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following three decades of research and conservation, the urban plan has been established and archaeologists have uncovered the main city square, lined with colonnaded stoas, districts of private houses with rich painted and sculpted decoration and an extensive necropolis of underground hypogea with many chambers as well as masonry tombs decorated with tall pillars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pcma.uw.edu.pl/fileadmin/template/main/img/historia/tablica25.jpg|title=Marina Al-Alamein.

* Polish Archaeological Mission at Marea, research since 2000. The team has explored a bath from the 6th century AD supplied with water from a well operated by a ''saqiya'' (wheel device moved by animal power). Since 2003 archaeologists have been excavating a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[basilica]], the second largest in Egypt, after the one in Abu Mena.&lt;sup&gt;[17]&lt;/sup&gt; The structures date from the heyday of the town when it was a major stop on the pilgrimage route to the nearby [[Abu Mena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventy Years of Polish Archaeology in Egypt|last=Szymańska|first=Hanna|last2=Babraj|first2=Krzysztof|publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=162–163|chapter=Marea on lake Maryut}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the shops on the street along the eastern facade of the basilica yielded a hoard of several hundred bronze coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://naukawpolsce.pap.pl/aktualnosci/news,407282,polskie-wykopaliska-na-wystawie-w-aleksandryjskim-muzeum-narodowym.html|title=Polskie wykopaliska na wystawie w aleksandryjskim Muzeum Narodowym|last=|first=|date=13 November 2015|website=Nauka w Polsce|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Polish-Slovakian Archaeological Mission at Tell el-Retaba, studying a fortress of the [[Ramesside Period|Ramesside period]] (New Kingdom, 13th–11th centuries BC) since 2007. The site is identified as the fortress of [[Pithom]] mentioned in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aigyptos.sk/en/tel-el-retabi|title=Tell el-Retaba, Aigyptos Foundation [dostęp 2017-06-27].|last=|first=|date=|website=Aigyptos Foundation|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the discoveries is the only known stable for horses from the [[Third Intermediate Period of Egypt|Third Intermediate Period]] and an army barracks structure.
* Polish Archaeological Mission at Tell el-Farkha, working since 1998. The site is a settlement on three mounds, located on a major trade route passing through the Nile Delta to the Mediterranean coast and Syria. Its peak development can be dated to the [[Amratian culture|Nagada period]]. Of highest significance among the discoveries are two golden statues of presumed rulers from the pre-Dynastic period, indicating that the site was a power center of some substance in this part of Egypt, before its decline about the time of the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, resulting from changing trade routes and the increased importance of water transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.farkha.org/english/stanowisko.html|title=Tell el-Farkha archaeological site|last=|first=|date=|website=Polish Archaeological Expedition to the Eastern Nile Delta - Tell el-Farkha|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Polish-Egyptian Archaeological Mission at [[Saqqara]], opened in 1987, working regularly since 1997, in a sector of the necropolis located to the west of the oldest [[pyramid]] in the world, the [[Pyramid of Djoser|step-pyramid of Djoser]], built around 2650 BC. Polish archaeologists proved that the site was not an ancient dump, although the tombs discovered there were located in and ancient stone quarry from the Third Dynasty.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dwadzieścia lat polskich badań w Sakkarze,|last=Myśliwiec|first=Karol|publisher=Wydawnictwo Instytutu Kultur Śródziemnomorskich i Orientalnych Polskiej Akademii Nauk|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lavishly decorated tombs (preserving the ancient polychromed reliefs in excellent condition) belonged to high-ranking nobles from the Sixth Dynasty, such as the vizier [[Merefnebef]] (discovered in 1997) and the admiral Nyankhnefertem, priest and trusted secretary of the pharaoh (discovered in 2003).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Polish Archaeological Mission at Naqlun (Deir el-Malak) in [[Faiyum Oasis|Fayum Oasis]], research since 1986 in a monastic complex established in the 5th century and still functional today. The site comprises scattered hermitages, a central compound of extended monastic buildings, church, refuse dump and two cemeteries, one from the 6th and the other a large medieval Christian cemetery of the 12th–13th century. Finds include pottery, burial textiles, basketry and many others. The written documents: letters, codices, literary texts, psalms and fragments of Gospels, in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], Greek, Arabic and Latin, are evidence of monastic continuity and the level of the monks’ education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventy Years of Polish Archaeology in Egypt|last=Godlewski|first=Włodzimierz|publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=176|chapter=Naqlun}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Polish–Egyptian Archaeological and Conservation Mission at the Temple of [[Hatshepsut]] at [[Deir el-Bahari]], operating since 1961. The main task of the mission is the restoration of the Upper Terrace of this magnificent temple of the New Kingdom Pharaoh-Queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.templeofhatshepsut.uw.edu.pl/en|title=About us|last=Szafrański|first=Zbigniew|date=|website=Polish-Egyptian Archaeological Mission at the Temple of Hatshepsut|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Polish Archaeological Mission at Sheikh Abd al-Gurna (“Hermitage Mission”), established in 2003 to study the 6th–8th century AD Coptic hermitage installed in two Middle Kingdom nobles' tombs in Western [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Seventy Years of Polish Archaeology in Egypt|last=Górecki|first=Tomasz|publisher=Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology, University of Warsaw|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=185–186|chapter=Sheikh Abd el-Gurna}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the mission has started to investigate the underground parts of the tombs. One of the most interesting finds are fragments of linen with ink-painted hieroglyphs, a gift of [[Ptolemy XII Auletes|Ptolemy XII]], the father of [[Cleopatra]], for the nearby temple at [[Deir el-Medina]].
* Polish–American Mission in [[Baris, Egypt|Berenike]] and the Eastern Desert, excavations since 2008 in the Hellenistic and Roman ruins of the Red Sea port. The port was built in the 3rd century BC, a prime purpose being the import of elephants from eastern Africa for the needs of the Ptolemaic armies.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://wyborcza.pl/7,75400,21114289,niezwykle-cmentarzysko-zwierzat-domowych-sprzed-2000-lat.html|title=Niezwykłe cmentarzysko zwierząt domowych sprzed 2000 lat|last=Grabowska|first=Joanna|date=13 December 2016|work=Wyborcza|access-date=2017-11-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The harbor was an important stop on the major Greek and Roman trade routes to India, from where spices and precious stones were brought, and probably China, from where silk was imported. Incense and myrrh were brought from Arabia. The goods were transported by land from the port to Coptos on the Nile (modern Qift), and then by water to the Nile Delta and further to [[Rome]]. A cemetery of animals (cats, dogs, monkeys) is being excavated on the outskirts of the harbor.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8486">In [[mathematics]], a '''residuated Boolean algebra''' is a [[residuated lattice]] whose lattice structure is that of a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]. Examples include Boolean algebras with the monoid taken to be conjunction, the set of all formal languages over a given alphabet Σ under concatenation, the set of all binary relations on a given set ''X'' under relational composition, and more generally the power set of any equivalence relation, again under relational composition. The original application was to [[relation algebra]]s as a finitely axiomatized generalization of the binary relation example, but there exist interesting examples of residuated Boolean algebras that are not relation algebras, such as the language example.

==Definition==
A '''residuated Boolean algebra''' is an algebraic structure (''L'', ∧, ∨, ¬, 0, 1, •, '''I''', \, /) such that
: (i) (''L'', &amp;and;, &amp;or;, •, '''I''', \, /) is a [[residuated lattice]], and
:(ii) (''L'', &amp;and;, &amp;or;, &amp;not;, 0, 1) is a Boolean algebra.

An equivalent signature better suited to the [[relation algebra]] application is (''L'', ∧, ∨, ¬, 0, 1, •, '''I''', ▷, ◁) where the unary operations ''x''\ and ''x''▷ are intertranslatable in the manner of [[De Morgan's laws]] via
:''x''\''y'' = &amp;not;(''x''&amp;#9655;&amp;not;''y''), &amp;nbsp; ''x''&amp;#9655;''y'' = &amp;not;(''x''\&amp;not;''y''), &amp;nbsp; and dually /''y'' and &amp;#9665;''y'' as
: ''x''/''y'' = &amp;not;(&amp;not;''x''&amp;#9665;''y''), &amp;nbsp; ''x''&amp;#9665;''y'' = &amp;not;(&amp;not;''x''/''y''),

with the residuation axioms in the [[residuated lattice]] article reorganized accordingly (replacing ''z'' by ¬''z'') to read
:(''x''&amp;#9655;''z'')&amp;and;''y'' = 0 &amp;nbsp; &amp;hArr; &amp;nbsp; (''x''•''y'')&amp;and;''z'' = 0 &amp;nbsp; &amp;hArr; &amp;nbsp; (''z''&amp;#9665;''y'')&amp;and;''x'' = 0

This [[De Morgan's laws|De Morgan dual]] reformulation is motivated and discussed in more detail in the section below on conjugacy.

Since residuated lattices and Boolean algebras are each definable with finitely many equations, so are residuated Boolean algebras, whence they form a finitely axiomatizable [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety]].

==Examples==
# Any Boolean algebra, with the monoid multiplication • taken to be conjunction and both residuals taken to be [[material conditional|material implication]] ''x''→''y''. Of the remaining 15 binary Boolean operations that might be considered in place of conjunction for the monoid multiplication, only five meet the monotonicity requirement, namely 0, 1, ''x'', ''y'', and ''x''∨''y''. Setting ''y'' = ''z'' = 0 in the residuation axiom ''y'' ≤ ''x''\''z'' &amp;nbsp; ⇔ &amp;nbsp; ''x''•''y'' ≤ ''z'', we have 0 ≤ ''x''\0 &amp;nbsp; ⇔ &amp;nbsp; ''x''•0 ≤ 0, which is falsified by taking ''x'' = 1 when ''x''•''y'' = 1, ''x'', or ''x''∨''y''. The dual argument for ''z''/''y'' rules out ''x''•''y'' = ''y''. This just leaves ''x''•''y'' = 0 (a constant binary operation independent of ''x'' and ''y''), which satisfies almost all the axioms when the residuals are both taken to be the constant operation ''x''/''y'' = ''x''\''y'' = 1. The axiom it fails is ''x''•'''I''' = ''x'' = '''I'''•''x'', for want of a suitable value for '''I'''. Hence conjunction is the only binary Boolean operation making the monoid multiplication that of a residuated Boolean algebra.
# The power set 2&lt;sup&gt;''X''²&lt;/sup&gt; made a Boolean algebra as usual with ∩, ∪ and complement relative to ''X''², and made a monoid with relational composition. The monoid unit '''I''' is the identity relation {(''x'',''x'')|''x'' ∈ ''X''}. The right residual ''R''\''S'' is defined by ''x''(''R''\''S'')''y'' if and only if for all ''z'' in ''X'', ''zRx'' implies ''zSy''. Dually the left residual ''S''/''R'' is defined by ''y''(''S''/''R'')''x'' if and only if for all ''z'' in ''X'', ''xRz'' implies ''ySz''.
# The power set 2&lt;sup&gt;Σ*&lt;/sup&gt; made a Boolean algebra as for example 2, but with language concatenation for the monoid. Here the set Σ is used as an alphabet while Σ* denotes the set of all finite (including empty) words over that alphabet. The concatenation ''LM'' of languages ''L'' and ''M'' consists of all words ''uv'' such that ''u'' ∈ ''L'' and ''v'' ∈ ''M''. The monoid unit is the language {ε} consisting of just the empty word ε. The right residual ''M''\''L'' consists of all words ''w'' over Σ such that ''Mw'' ⊆ ''L''. The left residual ''L''/''M'' is the same with ''wM'' in place of ''Mw''.

==Conjugacy==
The De Morgan duals ▷ and ◁ of residuation arise as follows. Among residuated lattices, Boolean algebras are special by virtue of having a complementation operation ¬. This permits an alternative expression of the three inequalities
:''y'' &amp;le; ''x''\''z'' &amp;nbsp; &amp;hArr; &amp;nbsp; ''x''•''y'' &amp;le; ''z'' &amp;nbsp; &amp;hArr; &amp;nbsp; ''x'' &amp;le; ''z''/''y''

in the axiomatization of the two residuals in terms of disjointness, via the equivalence ''x'' ≤ ''y'' ⇔ ''x''∧¬''y'' = 0. Abbreviating ''x''∧''y'' = 0 to ''x'' # ''y'' as the expression of their disjointness, and substituting ¬''z'' for ''z'' in the axioms, they become with a little Boolean manipulation
:&amp;not;(''x''\&amp;not;''z'') # ''y'' &amp;nbsp; &amp;hArr; &amp;nbsp; ''x''•''y'' # ''z'' &amp;nbsp; &amp;hArr; &amp;nbsp; &amp;not;(&amp;not;''z''/''y'') # ''x''

Now ¬(''x''\¬''z'') is reminiscent of [[De Morgan's laws|De Morgan duality]], suggesting that ''x''\ be thought of as a unary operation ''f'', defined by ''f''(y) = ''x''\''y'', that has a De Morgan dual ¬''f''(¬''y''), analogous to ∀''x''φ(''x'') = ¬∃''x''¬φ(''x''). Denoting this dual operation as ''x''▷, we define ''x''▷''z'' as ¬(''x''\¬''z''). Similarly we define another operation ''z''◁''y'' as ¬(¬''z''/''y''). By analogy with ''x''\ as the residual operation associated with the operation ''x''•, we refer to ''x''▷ as the conjugate operation, or simply '''conjugate''', of ''x''•. Likewise ◁''y'' is the '''conjugate''' of •''y''. Unlike residuals, conjugacy is an equivalence relation between operations: if ''f'' is the conjugate of ''g'' then ''g'' is also the conjugate of ''f'', i.e. the conjugate of the conjugate of ''f'' is ''f''. Another advantage of conjugacy is that it becomes unnecessary to speak of right and left conjugates, that distinction now being inherited from the difference between ''x''• and •''x'', which have as their respective conjugates ''x''▷ and ◁''x''.  (But this advantage accrues also to residuals when ''x''\ is taken to be the residual operation to ''x''•.)

All this yields (along with the Boolean algebra and monoid axioms) the following equivalent axiomatization of a residuated Boolean algebra.
:''y'' # ''x''&amp;#9655;''z'' &amp;nbsp; &amp;hArr; &amp;nbsp; ''x''•''y'' # ''z'' &amp;nbsp; &amp;hArr; &amp;nbsp; ''x'' # ''z''&amp;#9665;''y''

With this signature it remains the case that this axiomatization can be expressed as finitely many equations.

==Converse==
In examples 2 and 3 it can be shown that ''x''▷'''I''' = '''I'''◁''x''. In example 2 both sides equal the converse ''x''˘ of ''x'', while in example 3 both sides are '''I''' when ''x'' contains the empty word and 0 otherwise. In the former case ''x''˘ = ''x''. This is impossible for the latter because ''x''▷'''I''' retains hardly any information about ''x''. Hence in example 2 we can substitute ''x''˘ for ''x'' in ''x''▷'''I''' = ''x''˘ = '''I'''◁''x'' and cancel (soundly) to give
:''x''˘&amp;#9655;'''I''' = ''x'' =  '''I'''&amp;#9665;''x''˘.

''x''˘ = ''x'' can be proved from these two equations. [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]]'s notion of a '''[[relation algebra]]''' can be defined as a residuated Boolean algebra having an operation ''x''˘ satisfying these two equations.

The cancellation step in the above is not possible for example 3, which therefore is not a relation algebra, ''x''˘ being uniquely determined as ''x''▷'''I'''.

Consequences of this axiomatization of converse include ''x''˘ = ''x'', ¬(''x''˘) = (¬''x'')˘, (''x''∨''y'')˘ = ''x''˘∨''y''˘, and (''x''•''y'')˘ = ''y''˘•''x''˘.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2444">The England-wide '''Routes into Languages''' project is a consortium of universities working together with schools and colleges, to enthuse and encourage people to study languages. It is funded by [[HEFCE]], the Higher Education Funding Council for England (£4.5 million) and the Department for Children, Schools and Families (£3.5 million).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.routesintolanguages.ac.uk/about/index.html About | Routes Into Languages&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203093928/https://www.routesintolanguages.ac.uk/about/index.html |date=2013-12-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Routes into Languages aims to increase the take-up for modern foreign languages in English primary and secondary schools, and promote careers in [[translating]] and [[interpreting]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, M. (2007 )Attention, s'il vous plaît, ''Times Higher Education Supplement'' http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=209068&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lipsett, A. (2007) Who Got that cash? ''Times Higher Education Supplement'' http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=208941&lt;/ref&gt;

The phase 2 ( from August 2013 to July 2016) aims at promoting take up in learning languages while strengthening and widening an efficient network of universities, schools and key stakeholders throughout the UK. The theme of international mobility gives rise to a variety of projects and activities, from cultural events and revision days to e-mentoring and tutoring. These collaborations also aim at encouraging students to spend a year abroad during their studies, at widening access to language study and at promoting greater national capacity in the areas of employment that require proficiency in languages and enhance intercultural competence while helping to encourage a broader social profile of these areas.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.routesintolanguages.ac.uk/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Routes into Languages Programme in England is funded by the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] and hosted by the [[Subject Centre for Languages, Linguistics and Area Studies]] (LLAS)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7151">'''Sheldon Krimsky''' is Professor of Urban and Environmental Policy and Planning at [[Tufts University]], and adjunct professor in the Department of Family Medicine and Community Health at [[Tufts University School of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.councilforresponsiblegenetics.org "Council for Responsible Genetics"], Board of Directors. Accessed June 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He is a fellow of the [[Hastings Center]], an independent [[bioethics]] research institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehastingscenter.org/About/Default.aspx?id=902 The Hastings Center] Hastings Center Fellows.

Krimsky received his bachelor's and master's degrees in physics from [[Brooklyn College]] and [[Purdue University]] respectively, and a masters and doctorate in philosophy at [[Boston University]].

== Work ==

=== ''Science in the Private Interest'' ===
In his 2003 book ''Science in the Private Interest'', Krimsky points out that conflicts of interests are perceived and regulated very differently in public affairs and in science:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The prophylactic measures that are taken to prevent conflict of interest in public affairs are considered irrelevant in science precisely because scientists view themselves as participating in a higher calling than that of public officials—namely, the pursuit of objective knowledge. While senior public officials (elected or appointed) are prohibited from managing their portfolios during their tenure in office, scientists with patents and equity in companies that fund their research are at most simply asked to disclose their interests.{{sfn|Krimsky|Nader|2003}}{{rp|130}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Krimsky raises the concern that conflicts of interest may compromise the scientific norm of "disinterestedness", which "requires that scientists apply the methods, perform the analysis, and execute the interpretation of results without considerations of personal gain, ideology, or fidelity to any cause other than the pursuit of truth."{{sfn|Krimsky|Nader|2003}}{{rp|77}} He claims that blurred boundaries between public interest science and pursuit of private gain have severely compromised the integrity of university science:&lt;blockquote&gt;The evolving academic universe is no longer as nurturing an environment for public-interest science as it once was. To a large degree, universities have been taken over by money managers and academic entrepreneurs who are looking for financially lucrative research.{{sfn|Krimsky|Nader|2003}}{{rp|79}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Krimsky writes that the profit motive has corrupted many scientists in biomedical research. He also proposes that the relationships between corporations, universities, and government agencies have resulted in biased science that puts human health and environment at risk. He has written and commented on [[Genetically modified food|genetically modified foods]], [[water fluoridation]], [[environmental health]], [[global warming]], and other controversial topics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/23/science/a-conversation-with-sheldon-krimsky-uncoupling-campus-and-company.html A Conversation With: Sheldon Krimsky; Uncoupling Campus and Company], by Melody Petersen.

'''Socioscientific Issues (SSI)''' are controversial social issues which relate to science.&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D.L. &amp; Keefer, M. (2003). The role of moral reasoning and the status of socioscientific issues in science education: Philosophical, psychological and pedagogical considerations. In D.L. Zeidler (Ed.), The role of moral reasoning on socioscientific issues and discourse in science education. The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Press. (pp. 7-38)&lt;/ref&gt; They are ill-structured, open-ended problems which have multiple solutions.&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T.D. (2004). Informal reasoning regarding socioscientific issues: A critical review of research. Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 41, 513-536&lt;/ref&gt;

SSI are utilized in [[science education]] in order to promote [[scientific literacy]], which emphasizes the ability to apply scientific and moral reasoning to real-world situations.  Some examples of SSI include issues such as [[genetic engineering]], [[climate change]], [[animal testing]] for medical purposes, oil drilling in national parks, and "fat taxes" on "unhealthy" foods, among many others.  Research studies have shown SSI to be effective at increasing students' understanding of science in various contexts, [[Argumentation theory|argumentation skills]], [[empathy]], and [[Moral philosophy|moral reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T. D., &amp; Zeidler, D. L. (2005). The significance of content knowledge for informal reasoning regarding socioscientific issues: Applying genetics knowledge to genetic engineering issues. Science Education, 89(1), 71-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D. L., &amp; Sadler, T. D. (2008). The role of moral reasoning in argumentation: Conscience, character and care. In S. Erduran &amp; M. Pilar Jimenez-Aleixandre (Eds.), Argumentation in science education: Perspectives from classroom-based research (pp. 201-216). The Netherlands: Springer Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals of SSI ==
Supporters of SSI argue that it can:
* 1) Cultivate a scientifically literate citizens who are able to apply evidence-based scientific content knowledge to real-world socioscientific scenarios;
* 2) Foster a collective [[social conscience]] whereby students consistently reflect upon the formation and implications of their own reasoning;
* 3) Encourage [[Argumentation theory|argumentation]] skills that are essential for thinking and reasoning processes and mirror the types of discourse utilized in real-world scientific deliberations;
* 4) Promote [[critical thinking]] skills, such as analysis, inference, explanation,
evaluation, interpretation, and self-regulation&lt;ref&gt;Facione, P. A. (2007). Critical thinking: What it is and why it counts (2007 update). Millbrae, CA: Insight Assessment/California Academic Press LLC. Retrieved April 28, 2009, from www.insightassessment.com/pdf_files/what&amp;why2006. pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Science educators often refer to all of these aspects together as,"functional scientific literacy."&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D. L., Sadler, T. D., Simmons, M. L., &amp; Howes, E. V. (2005). Beyond STS: A research-based framework for socioscientific issues education. Science Education, 89(3), 357-377.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical Context of SSI ==

=== Scientific Literacy - Vision I and II ===
Scientific literacy has been defined by two competing visions. A Vision I approach to scientific literacy is characterized by content-driven, decontextualized science knowledge.  A Vision II approach to scientific literacy is a context-driven, student-centered approach which seeks to prepare students for informed [[civic engagement]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, D.A. (2007). Scientific literacy / science literacy. In S.K. Abell &amp; N.G. Lederman (Eds.), Handbook of research on science education (pp. 729-780). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;  The SSI framework follows a Vision II approach as it is believed to provide an opportunity for contextualized learning of science content as well as an opportunity for moral development.

=== SSI Distinguished from Science, Technology, and Society (STS) ===
SSI is conceptually related to [[Science, technology and society|Science, Technology, and Society]] (STS) education.  However, while both approaches connect science to societal issues, SSI is distinguished from STS because of its emphasis on the development of character and virtue as well as content knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeidler|first=D.|author2=Sadler, T.D. |author3=Simmons, M.L. |author4=Howes, E.V. |title=Beyond STS: A Research-Based|journal=Science Education|year=2005|volume=89|issue=3|pages=357–377|doi=10.1002/sce.20048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== SSI and Moral Reasoning ==
Research suggests that SSI creates [[cognitive dissonance]] by compelling students to consider claims that may be at odds with their own beliefs and values.&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D.L. &amp; Nichols, B.H. (2009). Socioscientific Issues: Theory and Practice. Journal of Elementary Science Education, 21, 2, 49-58&lt;/ref&gt; Dissonance of this nature is believed by some to advance [[moral reasoning]] by ‘empowering students to consider how science based issues and the decisions made concerning them reflect, in part, the moral principles and qualities of [[virtue]] that encompass their own lives, as well as the physical and social world around them.'&lt;ref&gt;
Zeidler, D. L., Sadler, T. D., Simmons, M. L., &amp; Howes, E. V. (2005). Beyond STS: A research-based framework for socioscientific issues education. Science Education, 89(3), 357-377, p. 360.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Supporting SSI ==
SSI education has been [[empirically]] investigated and linked to particular outcomes including:
• Promoting developmental changes in reflective judgment;&lt;ref&gt;Zeidler, D., Sadler, T., Applebaum, S., &amp; Callahan, B. (2009). Advancing reflective
judgment through socioscientific issues. Journal of Research in Science Teaching,

Zeidler (Ed.), The role of moral reasoning on socioscientific issues and discourse in science education. The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic Press. (pp. 7-38)&lt;/ref&gt;

confluence of ecojustice, place-based (science) education, and indigenous
knowledge systems (pp 105-128). New York: Springer&lt;/ref&gt; and
• Engage students’ interest in the [[Inquiry-based science|inquiry of science]].

More recently, SSI research has been focused on cross-cultural comparisons and research has reflected international partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, H.; Chang, H., Choi, K., Kim, S., Zeidler, D.L. (2011). "Developing Character and Values for Global Citizens: Analysis of pre-service science". International Journal of Science Education: 1-29.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been hypothesized by some that more advanced stages of epistemological reasoning allows individuals to apply a kind of socioscientific reasoning (SSR)&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T.D., Barab, S.A. and Scott, B. 2006. What do students gain by engaging in socio‐scientific inquiry?. Research in Science Education, 37: 371–391.&lt;/ref&gt; akin to scientific habits of mind. SSR is a theoretical construct that entails the ability to tap key traits while negotiating SSI. These include [[skepticism]], [[complexity]], [[multiple perspective]] and [[inquiry]].

== SSI in the Classroom ==

Teachers utilize SSI to foster understanding of science content and consequences involved in everyday scientific issues.  For example, in a study of [[ecology]], an elementary class might consider whether pesticides confer more benefit or harm to our ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;Forbes, C., &amp; Davis, E. A. (2008a). Exploring preservice elementary teachers’ critique and adaptation of science curriculum materials in respect to socioscientific issues. Science and Education, 17(8–9),829–854.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of analysis would require students to research the interractions between organisms in food webs and food chains, as well as the human impacts of pesticides. Students could make [[Evidence-based practice|evidence-based decisions]] and discuss them through various means including whole-class discussions, [[debates]], [[discussion boards|online discussion boards]], etc... Similarly, older grades might consider issues such as whether [[genetic engineering]] should be used to treat genetic diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Sadler, T. D., &amp; Zeidler, D. L. (2004). Negotiating gene therapy controversies. The
American Biology Teacher, 66, 428–433.&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of analysis would require extensive study of genetics and modern genetic engineering techniques, as well as the ethical issues involved in [[personal freedom]]s, religious prohibitions on intervention, and so on.  Advocates suggest that, through evidence-based [[discourse]], students learn to formulate their own informed decisions and understand those whose views differ from themselves.  An essential aspect of the implementation of SSI is that the teacher is not promoting any particular belief; rather, the teacher's role is to promote evidence-based critical thinking and argumentation.

A '''stabilized liquid membrane device''' or '''SLMD''' is a type of [[Environmental monitoring|passive sampling device]] which allows for the [[In situ|in situ]], integrative collection of waterborne, [[Lability|labile]] ionic metal contaminants.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;Brumbaugh, W.G., Petty, J.D., Huckins, J.N., Manahan, S.E. 2002. Stabilized liquid membrane device (SLMD) for the passive, integrative sampling of labile metals in water. Water, Air, Soil Pollut. 133, 109–119.&lt;/ref&gt; By capturing and sequestering metal ions onto its surface continuously over a period of days to weeks, an SLMD can provide an integrative measurement of [[Bioavailability|bioavailable]] toxic metal ions present in the aqueous environment.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;Petty, J.D., Brumbaugh, W.G., Huckins, T.W.M., Wiedmeyer, R. 2001. US Patent No. US006296760B1.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they have been used in conjunction with other passive samplers in ecological field studies.&lt;ref name=a4&gt;2012. Potential Causes for Impairment of Rainbow Trout Early Life stages and Loss of Benthic Biodiversity in Indian Creek. Washington State Department of Ecology.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a7&gt;Brumbaugh, W.G., May, W.T., Besser, J.M., Allert, A.L., Schmitt, C.J. 2008. Assessment of Elemental Concentrations in Streams of the New Lead Belt in Southeastern Missouri, 2002-05. Scientific Investigations Report 2007-5057.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Passive samplers were first developed in the early 1970s to monitor concentrations of airborne contaminants industrial workers might be exposed to, but by the 1990s researchers had developed and utilized passive samplers to monitor contaminants in the aqueous environment.&lt;ref name=a2&gt;Alvarez, D. 2013. Development of Semipermeable Membrane Devices (SPMDs) and Polar Organic Integrative Samplers (POCIS) for Environmental Monitoring. Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry. 23: 2179–2181.&lt;/ref&gt; The first type of passive sampler made for use in the aqueous environment was the [[Semipermeable membrane devices|semipermeable membrane device]] (SPMD).&lt;ref name=a2&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; SPMDs could be used to determine time-weighted average concentrations of [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] organic contaminants, but until the early 2000s passive sampling devices for metal contaminants had not yet emerged.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Metals in the environment can speciate into different forms. Most metals dissolved in the aqueous environment are present as any of several ionic, complex-ion, and organically bound states.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For most toxic metals, bioavailability is greatest for labile metals in their free ionic state.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing the potential usefulness of a passive sampling device that could be used to measure trace amounts of bioavailable toxic metals, researchers at the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) and [[University of Missouri-Columbia]] began development on a counterpart to SPMDs that could be used to sample for labile metals.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure and function ==
The outer portion of a SLMD consists of a section of sealed, flat, semi-permeable polyethylene tubing. Sealed inside this tubing is a 1:1 mixture of a hydrophobic [[Chelation|metal complexing agent]] and a long chain [[Organic acid|organic acid]].&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The organic acid diffuses through the tubing to the outer surface, where the [[carboxylic acid]] portion can form stable complexes with calcium and magnesium ions in the water.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This allows a waxy layer to slowly accumulate on the outside of the tube. the metal complexing agent continuously mobilizes into this waxy layer, where it can sequester metal ions from the water.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The hydrophobic metal complexing agent most commonly used in SLMDs is an [[Alkylation|alkylated]] 8-hyroxyquinoline.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oleic acid]] is commonly used as the other half of the 1:1 hydrophobic reagent mixture, as it readily forms calcium oleates in the aqueous sampling media.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the base device, hydrophobic plastic sheaths are sometimes used to house SLMDs in the field.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Variable water flow can alter the sampling rates of metals by SLMDs, making a time-averaged concentration difficult to determine.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By allowing liable metal analytes to diffuse to the SLMD's surface while limiting the diffusion of particulate, [[colloidal]], or humic substances, these hydrophobic sheaths help reduce variability of SLMD uptake in faster moving waters.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After being deployed for a known time interval, SLMDs can be recovered from the field for analysis. Washing with 20% [[nitric acid]] allows for the extraction of accumulated metals, and by using analytical techniques like [[Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry|inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy]] (ICP-MS) or [[Atomic absorption spectroscopy|atomic absorption spectroscopy]] (flame AAS)  to measure the concentration of metal in the extract, the amount of metal accumulated by the SLMD can be determined.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
SLMDs are known to accumulate [[cadmium]], [[cobalt]], [[copper]], [[nickel]], [[lead]], and [[zinc]],&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and have been deployed in freshwater monitoring studies by The Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology)&lt;ref name=a4&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the USGS.&lt;ref name=a6&gt;United States Geological Society (USGS) Columbia Environmental Research Center. May 2004. Retrieved 5/28/2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
Ecology deployed SLMDs in upper and lower Indian Creek for 28 and 27 days respectively.&lt;ref name=a4&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Metal concentrations on the SLMDs were used to estimate the true concentration of metals in the creek. The estimated concentration was expressed as a range based on sampling rate of SLMDs as well as the length of exposure. The purpose of the sampling was to investigate potential causes of sublethal effects of young trout and loss of benthic biodiversity in the creek.&lt;ref name=a4&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages and limitations ==
Toxic metals can be present in the aqueous environment at [[Trace element|trace]] or ultra-trace concentrations, yet still be toxicologically significant and thus cause harm to humans or the environment.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Because these concentrations are so low, they would fall beyond the [[detection limit]]s of most analytical instruments if the media had been sampled using traditional grab samples.&lt;ref name=a3&gt;Petty, J.D., Huckins, J.N. Alvarez, D.A., Brumbaugh, W.G., Cranor W.L., Gale, R.W., Rastall, A.C., Jones-Lepp T.L., Leiker T.J., Rostad C.E., Furlong E.T., 2004. A holistic passive integrative sampling approach for assessing the presence and potential impacts of waterborne environmental contaminants. Chemosphere 54, 695-709.&lt;/ref&gt; Using SLMDs to passively collect metals over an extended period of time allows for trace metals to accumulate to detectable levels, which can give more accurate estimate of aquatic chemistry and contamination.&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; SLMDs also have the advantage of being able to capture pulses of metal contamination that might otherwise go undetected when using [[Grab sample|grab samples]].&lt;ref name=a4&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
SLMDs are limited to the assessment of labile metals, and cannot be used to monitor for [[Organic compound|organic contaminants]]. Further, while the ability of SLMDs to sample copper, zinc, nickel, lead, and cadmium has been repeatedly demonstrated,&lt;ref name=a1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a5&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a7&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; there has been little laboratory research on their ability to reliably uptake other toxic metals. Still, while laboratory studies on the effectiveness of SLMDs have only investigated copper, zinc, nickel, lead, and cadmium, SLMDs have been used with success in field studies to assess a wider range of metals.&lt;ref name=a4&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stanley John Sadie''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|d|i}}; 30 October 1930 – 21 March 2005) was an influential and prolific British [[musicology|musicologist]], music critic, and editor. He was editor of the sixth edition of the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' (1980), which was published as the first edition of ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]''.&lt;ref name="Bio Index" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker's Bio Dict"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker's 20th C Classical" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baker's opera" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IAML 2015 Mar 26" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTs 2005 Mar 23" /&gt;

== Career ==
Born in [[Wembley]], Sadie was educated at [[St Paul's School, London]], and [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], where he read music under [[Thurston Dart]]. Sadie earned [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Bachelor of Music]] degrees in 1953, a [[Master of Arts]] degree in 1957, and a [[PhD]] in 1958. His [[doctoral dissertation]] was on mid-eighteenth-century British [[chamber music]].&lt;ref name="Sadie dissertation 1958" /&gt; After Cambridge, he taught at [[Trinity College of Music]], London (1957–1965).&lt;ref name="Contemporary Authors Rev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Contemporary Authors" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Int. Authors" /&gt;

Sadie then turned to music journalism, becoming music critic for ''[[The Times]]'' (1964–1981), and contributing reviews to the ''[[Financial Times]]'' after 1981, when he had to leave his position and ''The Times'' because of his commitments to the ''Grove'' and other scholarly work. He was editor of ''[[The Musical Times]]'' from 1967 until 1987.&lt;ref name="WW in Music, Gaster" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Intl WW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grove" /&gt;

From 1970 Sadie was editor of what was planned to be the sixth edition of the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' (1980). Sadie oversaw major changes to the dictionary, which grew from nine volumes to twenty, and was published as ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'' (''New Grove''), and is now referred to as the first edition under that name. He was also an important force behind the second edition of ''New Grove'' (2001), which grew further to 29 volumes. Sadie also oversaw a major expansion of the ''Grove'' franchise, editing the one-volume ''Grove Concise Dictionary of Music'' (1988), and several spinoff dictionaries, such as the ''New Grove Dictionary of Musical Instruments'' (three volumes, 1984), the ''New Grove Dictionary of American Music'', (with H. Wiley Hitchcock, four volumes, 1986), and ''[[The New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]'' (four volumes, 1992). He also edited composer biographies based on the entries in ''Grove''.&lt;ref name="Aughor/Gale" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WW St. Martins" /&gt;

Outside his work on the ''Grove'' dictionaries, Sadie edited the ''[[Man and Music]]'' volumes accompanying a television series (1989–1993).&lt;ref name="ODNB" /&gt; He was also an accomplished bassoonist.&lt;ref name="Author's &amp; Writer's WW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WW Entmt." /&gt;&lt;ref name="WWIW Marquis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WrDr" /&gt;

Sadie died at his home in [[Cossington, Somerset|Cossington]], Somerset, 21 March 2005, of [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (Lou Gehrig's disease), which had been diagnosed only a few weeks earlier.

{{anchor|Family}}Sadie married twice. His first wife, Adèle Sadie ''(née'' Bloom; 1931–1978) – who he married in 1953 in London, and with whom he had two sons and a daughter – died in 1978. Sadie married Julie Anne Sadie, PhD ''(née'' Vertrees; born 1948), also a musicologist, in 1978. They had a son and a daughter.

==Honours==
In 1982, Sadie was appointed CBE (Commander of the [[Order of the British Empire]]). He received an honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] from the [[University of Leicester]] in 1982, and was elected honorary [[fellow]] of the [[Royal College of Music]] in 1994 and [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]]. In 2005, Sadie became a [[Handel Music Prize|Handel Music Prize laureate]].

[[File:Arm-robotic 010 final.png|thumb|150px|A conceptional science fiction prosthetic/robotic arm.]]
'''Technology in science fiction''' examines the possibilities and implications of new technological concepts.  Authors have taken, or created, new innovations and technologies, and elaborated on what they might be and how they might be used.  This exchange goes in both directions – sometimes the technology appears first in science fiction, then becomes reality (such as [[interplanetary spaceflight|space travel]]) and other times the real technology comes first, and science fiction authors speculate about how it might be used, and how it might affect the human condition.  Likewise, the accuracy of the technology portrayed spans a wide range – sometimes it is existing technology, sometimes it is a physically realistic portrayal of a far-out technology, and sometimes it is simply a plot device that looks scientific, but has no basis in science.  Examples drawn from space travel in science fiction include:
*Realistic case:  [[Space suit]]s.  These are almost always based on existing suits, or near-term extrapolation of their capabilities.
*Extrapolation:  Travel within the [[Solar System]].  As of 2018, humans have only travelled in Earth orbit or from Earth to Moon and back. However, travelling within the Solar System violates no physical principles.
*Plot device: [[faster-than-light drive]].  It is unsupported by physics as we know it, but needed for galaxy-wide or intergalactic plots with human lifespans.

== Fictional technologies that have since been realized ==
Almost every new technology that becomes practical was previously used in science fiction. The following are a few examples, from a very large set:

'''Transparent Aluminum''' as featured in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe has since become a reality&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123012131 | title=Air Force testing new transparent armor}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[Aluminium oxynitride]] ([[ALONtm]]), patented in 1985,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=4520116 |title=Patent US4520116 - Transparent aluminum oxynitride and method of manufacture| accessdate=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as different from metallic aluminum as [[rust]] is from [[iron]]. Rather than being used as transparent blast shielding as in the fictional [[Starship Enterprise|Enterprise]] class starships, this transparent ceramic is used, as the chemically similar (and similarly expensive) [[corundum]] (crystalline aluminum oxide) has long been used, in tough windows.

'''Tractor/Repulsor Beams''' have been realized as Laser-based [[Optical tweezers]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Optical Tweezers]] an Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently as a pair of [[Bessel beam]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physicscentral.com/buzz/blog/index.cfm?postid=4633845616090952216 |title=The One Where NASA Asks for a Tractor Beam}}&lt;/ref&gt; These instruments use the radiation from the laser beam to manipulate microscopic particles in what is called an "[[optical trap]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physicscentral.com/buzz/blog/index.cfm?postid=4633845616090952216 |title=The One Where NASA Asks for a Tractor Beam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2222525/Real-life-Star-Trek-tractor-beam-developed--wont-dragging-space-ships-time-soon.html |title=Real life Star Trek tractor beam developed - but it won't be dragging space ships any time soon | location=London | work=Daily Mail |first=Damien |last=Gayle |date=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; along the length of the beam as desired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physicscentral.com/buzz/blog/index.cfm?postid=4633845616090952216 |title=The One Where NASA Asks for a Tractor Beam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fictional Tractor beams have been prominently used in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe and in the ''Star Trek'' universe.  In an early scene of ''[[Star Wars: A New Hope]]'' a large spaceship uses such a beam to seize a small one, in order to capture the protagonists.

'''Artificial Vision/Prosthetic Eyes''' [[Visual prosthesis]] has been a topic of experiments since the late 20th century. 

Notable characters using artificial vision include all characters from the [[Ghost in the Shell]] series who use prosthetic bodies e.g. [[Batou]]'s ranger eyes, [[Saito (Ghost in the Shell)|Saito]]'s left eye, and [[Motoko Kusanagi]]'s artificial eyes, [[Geordi La Forge]] from the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' series who made use of a [[VISOR]] and later; ocular implants, [[RoboCop]] from the RoboCop series, [[Spike Spiegel]] from the [[Cowboy Bebop]] anime series, and the [[Illusive Man]] from the [[Mass Effect]] series of videogames.


'''Tricorder''' The Lab-On-a-Chip Application Development Portable Test System ([[LOCAD]]-PTS) used by astronauts on the International Space Station is designed specifically to biochemical molecules with the purpose of "identifying microbes on space station services" through use of the [[Gram Staining]] Method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/09may_tricorder/ | title=Space StationTricorder  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though less advanced than the fictional [[tricorder]] of the ''Star Trek'' series, the LOCAD-PTS is useful for quickly identifying bacteria and fungi on the International Space Station without having to send samples back to Earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/09may_tricorder/ | title=Space StationTricorder  }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus risking contamination or degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/09may_tricorder/ | title=Space StationTricorder  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fungi have proven to be a hazard if left unchecked on the space station as they managed to decompose some Russian electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/09may_tricorder/ | title=Space StationTricorder  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tricorder featured in the ''Star Trek'' universe was capable of measuring almost anything, from the chemical composition of explosives, to the life signs of a dying humanoid. The LOCAD-PTS does not differentiate between live and dead test material yet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2008/09may_tricorder/ | title=Space StationTricorder  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spaceflight ==
Since the principles of rocketry were worked out in the early 20th century, writers have used straightforward extrapolation to support stories of interplanetary exploration, colonization, conquest and so forth.

With new developments in space exploration and technology the idea of space exploration became a reality.  Though many writers explored space travel before these events and inventions, the reality of new technologies and the evidence that space exploration was now possible opened new doors to create more fantastical ideas of space travel.  Many Science Fiction topics are born from reality, but turn these new technologies to create imagined realities, thus creating Science Fiction in itself.

[[File:Apollo 11 Saturn V lifting off on July 16, 1969.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Saturn V]] carrying ''[[Apollo 11]]'' to the Moon, blasting off on July 16, 1969]]

1903 – The [[Wright brothers]] invented the first motored and manned airplane, launching the age of human flight  

1920s – [[Robert Goddard]] and [[Wernher von Braun]] developed liquid-fueled rockets, later applied as the [[V-2 rocket|V2]] in war. Fictional spaceships of the 1950s were typically shaped like the V2. Later long range missiles influenced later fiction.

The [[Space Race]] between the US and Soviet Union inspired more precise depiction of technology already under development.

The launch of the first man-made object to orbit Earth; [[USSR]]'s [[Sputnik 1]] (October 4, 1957)

[[Space station]]s, first presented in crude form by [[The Brick Moon]], were popularized in the 1960s by books agitating for further development. Those little resembled the [[Salyut 1]] or later actual stations. [[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)]] presented the "[[rotating wheel space station]]" of the 1960s but few others did. The long-running fictional [[Deep Space Nine (space station)]] and [[Babylon 5 (space station)]] little resembled any of the above.

=== Faster than light ===
Galactic-scale stories usually call for [[interstellar travel]] in human lifetimes, which is not supported by existing science, so this technology is more speculative. Among the earliest introductions to this concept include E.E. "Doc" Smith's element X-powered spaceship in the ''Skylark''  and [[Lensman series]] (1920s).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science Fiction After 1900: From the Steam Man to the Stars|last=Landon|first=Brooks|publisher=Routledge|year=2002|isbn=0415938880|location=New York|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The so-called X solution unlocked the atomic power of copper, which is then used to power an advanced propulsion system.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In these narratives, the ships are "inertia-less"; this [[Inertialess drive]] makes travel effortless at huge multiples of the speed of light.

The faster-than-light travel was also explained in [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]] and became a familiar term thereafter particularly since the concept was also used by the ''Star Wars'' films as well as other fictional intergalactic narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Science and Technology Communication, Volume 1|last=Priest|first=Susanna|publisher=SAGE|year=2010|isbn=9781412959209|location=Los Angeles, CA|pages=705}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyperspace''' commonly designates one class of technology, where infinite speeds are possible; a ship may jump to [[Hyperspace (science fiction)|hyper space]] or star drive "clutching at the very fabric of time itself" thus making travel that would normally take thousands of years possible in no time at all. One example of narrative descriptions for hyperspace was [[John E. Stith|John E Stith]]'s conceptualization in the novel ''Redshift Rendezvouz'' (1990). The author described that a spacecraft operating in a hyperspace moves at exactly 1,024 times the speed of light relative to normal space time, with the speed of light lower than 300,000 kilometers per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Slow Light: Invisibility, Teleportation, And Other Mysteries Of Light|last=Sidney|first=Perkowitz|publisher=Imperial College Press|year=2011|isbn=9781848167520|location=London|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanical life/Androids/Robots ==

While now (as of 2017) there are companies that are fully devoted to creating robots and artificial intelligence,  these ideas were long present in science fiction before they started to become real technology.  Mechanical and artificial characters were derived both from extrapolations of real engineering efforts, and from the whims and imaginations of the authors. This technology has given writers, as well as other forms of art, the inspiration to create non-human characters.

===Definitions===

'''[[Artificial Intelligence]]'''
(also known as '''machine intelligence''' and often abbreviated as '''AI''') is intelligence exhibited by any manufactured (not grown) system. The term is often applied to general-purpose computers and also in the field of scientific investigation into the theory and practical application of AI.

'''A [[robot]]''' is an electro-mechanical or bio-mechanical device or group of devices that can perform autonomous or preprogrammed tasks.

'''An [[android (robot)|android]]''' is a robot made to resemble a human, usually both in appearance and behavior. The word derives from the Greek andr-, " meaning "man, male", and the suffix -eides, used to mean "of the species; alike" (from eidos "species").

'''A [[cyborg]]''' is a cybernetic organism which adds to or enhances its abilities by using technology.

===Early timeline of real world technology===

== ESP/Psychic powers/Psi phenomena ==

With new developments in science and technology helping to study and promote parapsychology or Psi Phenomena, many SF writers felt the need to incorporate and elaborate on these subjects in their stories.  While technology helped the investigation into Psi Phenomena it also created questions that many SF writers chose to answer, through their stories, in their own unique way.  If we look at some of the examples of Psi Phenomena prominent in stories, they may have stemmed from how science would take this experimentation with Psi Phenomena and use it. In Stephen King's "The Dead Zone", we see how precognition was used to affect political candidates.  The idea that someone could harness this power and use it for good or evil was one that many SF writer's elaborated on.  In "The Foreign Hand Tie" by Randall Garret espionage takes on a new form via telepathy through twins.  When science and technology can be used to anchor something in reality, via experimentation or exploration, and yield results, it creates controversy that society may fear or even fantasize about.  Throughout SF history, Psi Phenomena can be seen to be used for good and evil, and through new science and technological discoveries, this genre then becomes more real and more elaborate.

=== Terms commonly used ===

*[[Telepathy]]: the ability to read minds
*[[Precognition]]: the ability to see the future
*[[Telekinesis]]: the ability to move objects with mental force (Psychokinesis (PK for short) or "mind over matter")
*[[Teleportation]]: the ability to move oneself from one place to the other, or back and forward in time
*Telempathy: Emotion-reading
*[[Remote viewing]]/[[Clairvoyance]]/[[Scrying]]: the ability for seeing things not actually before your eyes
*[[Psychometry (paranormal)|Psychometry]]: the ability to sense what has touched a certain physical object or the imprint it has left behind
*[[Bilocation]]: the ability to be in two places at the same time.
*[[Pyrokinesis]]: the capability to start fires by mental action alone

===Brief history of psi phenomena in science===

While [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]] and belief in other powers were, in the beginning, mainly fueled by [[superstitions]], [[religion]] and tradition, the dawn of [[science]] brought about a way to analyze and study these supposed "powers" giving them an anchor in reality.  The [[Scientific Revolution]] featured ideas that life should be "led by reason" and that, "the universe as a mechanistic, deterministic system could eventually be known accurately and fully through observation and reason".  While new science and technology gave rise to skepticism towards the existence of [[psi phenomena]], it also gave way for new technologies to be applied in either proving or disproving such phenomena.  One of the first experimental approaches to Psi Phenomena started in the 1930s and was conducted under the direction of [[J.B. Rhine]] (1895–1980).  Rhine popularized the now famous methodology of card guessing and dice rolling experiments in a laboratory in attempt to find statistical validation for ESP.  In 1957 the [[Parapsychological Association]] was formed at the preeminent society for [[parapsychology]].  Openness to new parapsychology studies and occult phenomena continued to rise in the 1970s.

===Technological developments===

*Ganzfeld Experiment: homogenous, unpatterened, sensory stimulation to produce an effect similar to sensory deprivation
*Development of statistical tools by R. A. Fisher in the 1920s

==Visitors from other planets==
[[Extraterrestrial life]] is a familiar topic in fiction.  In the centuries since astronomers discovered that planets are worlds, people have speculated on the possibility of life existing there, though [[xenobiology]] has remained a science without a subject.  However, people from afar, or alien creatures with various powers and purposes, provided fresh new material for fiction.  Some stories were about friendly visitors who got along with humans, such as the aliens in the [[Keroro Gunsou]] series, when they give up on attempting to take over planet Earth.  Others made [[alien invasion]] their theme, as in the 1898 novel, [[War of the Worlds]].  [[Meteorite]]s have long shown that foreign bodies sometimes enter Earth's atmosphere, and the term "[[flying saucer]]" was coined in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.brumac.8k.com/KARNOLD/KARNOLD.html | title=JUNE 24, 1947: HOW IT ALL BEGAN The Story of the Arnold Sighting}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several science fiction novels used them.
===Early writers===
*''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' by [[H. G. Wells]], first serialised in 1897
*''[[Martians, Go Home]]'' by [[Fredric Brown]], 1956
*''The Moon that Vanished'' by [[Leigh Brackett]], 1950
*''3 From Out There'' by [[Leo Margulies]], 1959

== Parallel worlds ==

The notion of parallel worlds have always intrigued different types of genres, especially the science fiction aspect. Many authors have used the idea of travelling back into prehistoric times or traveling forwards to an unknown universe. The idea of entering a world that has not been touched or that has evolved into a new incomprehensible parallel, makes people ponder about what it could looks like or what it could be. Authors have used this notion of an alternate reality and have created their own worlds that have given readers a different view of alternate worlds.

=== Early writers ===

*Sideways in Time by [[Murray Leinster]] Novel (1934)
*[[Lest Darkness Fall]] By L. Sprague De Camp Novel (1939)
*Horsesense Hank in the Parallel Worlds by [[Nelson S. Bond]] Magazine (1942)
*[[The Alteration]] by Kingsley Amis Novel (1976)
*[[The Anubis Gates]] By Tim Powers Novel (1983)

=== Definition ===
'''[[Parallel universe (fiction)|Parallel Universe]]''' Parallel universe or alternate reality in science fiction and fantasy is a self-contained separate reality coexisting with our own

===Other terms===

'''[[Multiverse]]''' Set of many universes. There are many specific uses of the concept, as well as systems in which a multiverse is proposed to exist in.

'''[[Parallel universe (fiction)|Parallel universe]]''' alternate universes, worlds, realities and dimensions in fiction.

'''[[Parallel universe (fiction)|Alternate reality]]''' alternate universes, worlds, realities and dimensions in fiction.

'''[[Alternate future]]''' is a possible future which never comes to pass, typically because someone travels back into the past and alters it so that the events of the alternate future cannot occur.

== Invisibility ==
[[File:Hollywood steps out (34).png|thumb|INVISIBILITY]]
The idea of being unseen and hence undetectable has fascinated mankind for generations. This concept has generated scientific pursuit towards defying our physical parameters. Many authors have toyed with the idea of gaining invisibility via both science-based and fictional means.  Invisibility in the actual scientific world will be a very difficult achievement, one that will involve much more complication than we have begun to delve into. Further technological developments bring us closer to our goal, while also broadening the horizon for science fiction authors performing thought experiments on the topic of invisibility.

=== Mythology and folklore precursors ===

Many myths and legends include [[gods]], [[spirit]]s, [[angels]], and [[demons]] that are often invisible or can choose to become invisible at will.

*One of the first stories to explore the idea of invisibility was in [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''. A peasant finds a ring in the tomb of a dead king that allows him to become invisible. He enters the palace, seduces the queen, and plots to kill the present king, showing that power such as invisibility corrupts.
*[[Perseus]], the Greek mythic hero who helped establish the Twelve Olympians, was equipped with a [[cap of invisibility]] to kill [[Medusa]].

===Early writers===

*[[H. G. Wells]] wrote ''[[The Invisible Man]]'' (1897) which was the first science fiction novel to explore the idea of invisibility. The invisible man is a scientist named Griffin who theorizes that if a person's [[refractive index]] is changed to exactly that of air and his body does not absorb or reflect light, then he will not be visible. He successfully carries out this procedure on himself, but cannot become visible again, leading to mental instability.
*[[J. R. R. Tolkien]] wrote ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' series which revolves around the function of a ring that renders the user invisible. Unfortunately, it had an evil influence with negative effects on the wearer's actions.
*[[Douglas Adams]] wrote ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' (1978) novels which encompass a humorous concept of a field which makes people believe the object in question is "somebody else's problem" and therefore do not see it. This concept as explained in the book, bases off of a statement to the effect that actual invisibility is impossible and that the field is merely a way to make something close to being invisible by actually making it hard to notice deliberately.
*[[Philip K. Dick]] wrote in his 1974 novel A ''[[Scanner Darkly]]'' of a "scramble suit." This is a flexible sheath covering the body of the wearer with a reflective/refractive coating on the inside surface that transfers the camouflaging pattern- projected by a [[holographic lens]] mounted on the wearer's head- onto the outside surface of the sheath causing a camouflage-like invisibility.

===Definition===
[[Invisibility]] is a term that is usually used as a fantasy or science fiction term where objects are literally made unseeable by magical or technological means.

===Invisibility in science fiction===
There is an undeniable link between science fact and the ideas that emerge in science fiction. Science fiction authors are inspired by actual scientific and technological discoveries, but allow themselves the freedom to project the possible future course of these discoveries and their potential impact on society, perhaps only weakly bound to the facts.

===Invisibility in fiction===
Authors are faced with obstacles presented by the realities of actual technology, however fiction allows a window for the opportunity of inventing completely imaginary technologies to move their storyline forward and maybe even still explore the outcomes of such power.

*Magic objects such as rings and cloaks can be worn to grant the wearer permanent invisibility.
*Spells and potions can be used or cast upon people or objects granting temporary invisibility.

=== Timeline of possible influences ===

* 17th century the refractive index was developed. Major advances near the end of the 19th century raised author's awareness.
* 1670s Emitting or reflecting light outside the [[wavelength]] range of [[visible light]] would result in a human-shaped [[black hole]] which would be completely opaque.
* 1930s [[Chroma key]] began to develop which is the removal of color from one image to reveal another image "behind it." The removed color becomes transparent, which is also called "color keying."
* 1938 [[Stealth technology]] began to develop. It is used with aircraft, ships, and missiles, in order to make them less visible to certain detection methods.
* 1966 An enemy in a ''[[Star Trek]]'' episode uses a [[Cloaking device]]. Other fiction has used a [[cloak of invisibility]].

{{Periodic table (micro)|title=|caption=Examples of toxic heavy metals|mark=Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Ag, Cd, Sb, Hg, Tl, Pb}}
[[File:Kingston-plant-spill-swanpond-tn2.jpg|thumb|A {{convert|25|ft|m|sing=on}} wall of coal [[fly ash]] contaminated with toxic heavy metals, resulting from the [[Kingston Fossil Plant coal fly ash slurry spill|release of 5.4 million cubic yards of coal fly ash]] slurry into the [[Emory River]], [[Tennessee]], and nearby land and water features, in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dewan8|Dewan 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt; Testing showed significantly elevated levels of arsenic, copper, [[barium]], cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, nickel, and thallium in samples of slurry and river water.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dewan9|Dewan 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt; Cleanup costs may exceed $1.2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Poovey|Poovey 2001]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''toxic heavy metal''' is any relatively dense [[metal]] or [[metalloid]] that is noted for its potential toxicity, especially in environmental contexts.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sriv|Srivastava &amp; Goyal 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;2]]&lt;/ref&gt; The term has particular application to [[cadmium]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], [[lead]] and [[arsenic]],&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brath|Brathwaite &amp; Rabone 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;363]]&lt;/ref&gt; all of which appear in the [[World Health Organization]]'s list of 10 chemicals of major public concern. Other examples include [[manganese]], [[chromium]], [[cobalt]], [[nickel]], [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[selenium]], [[silver]], [[antimony]] and [[thallium]].{{cn|date=February 2017}}

[[Heavy metals]] are found naturally in the earth. They become concentrated as a result of human caused activities and can enter plant, animal, and human tissues via inhalation, diet, and manual handling. Then, they can bind to and interfere with the functioning of vital cellular components. The toxic effects of arsenic, mercury, and lead were known to the ancients, but methodical studies of the toxicity of some heavy metals appear to date from only 1868. In humans, heavy metal poisoning is generally treated by the administration of [[chelation|chelating agents]]. Some elements otherwise regarded as toxic heavy metals are essential, in small quantities, for human health.

== Contamination sources ==
[[File:Tetraethyllead-3D-balls.png|thumb|[[Tetraethyl lead]] is one of the most significant heavy metal contaminants in recent use.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wright|Wright 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;288]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Heavy metals are found naturally in the earth, and become concentrated as a result of human activities. Common sources are mining and industrial wastes; vehicle emissions; [[Lead–acid battery|lead-acid batteries]]; fertilisers; paints; treated woods; aging water supply infrastructure;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harvey|Harvey, Handley &amp; Taylor 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[microplastics]] floating in the world's oceans.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Howell|Howell et al. 2012]]; [[#Cole|Cole et al. 2011, pp.&amp;nbsp;2589‒2590]]&lt;/ref&gt; Arsenic, cadmium and lead may be present in children's toys at levels that exceed regulatory standards. Lead can be used in toys as a [[stabilizer (chemistry)|stabilizer]], color enhancer, or anti-corrosive agent. Cadmium is sometimes employed as a stabilizer, or to increase the mass and luster of toy jewelry. Arsenic is thought to be used in connection with coloring dyes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Finch|Finch, Hillyer &amp; Leopold 2015, pp.&amp;nbsp;849–850]]&lt;/ref&gt; Regular imbibers of [[Moonshine|illegally distilled alcohol]] may be exposed to arsenic or lead poisoning the source of which is arsenic-contaminated lead used to [[solder]] the distilling apparatus. [[Rat poison]] used in grain and [[Mash ingredients|mash]] stores may be another source of the arsenic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Aggrawal|Aggrawal 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;680]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lead is the most prevalent heavy metal contaminant.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Di Maio|Di Maio 2001, p.&amp;nbsp;527]]&lt;/ref&gt; As a component of [[tetraethyl lead]], {{chem|(CH|3|CH|2|)|4|Pb}}, it was used extensively in [[gasoline]] during the 1930s–1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lovei|Lovei 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;15]]&lt;/ref&gt; Lead levels in the aquatic environments of industrialised societies have been estimated to be two to three times those of pre-industrial levels.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Perry|Perry &amp; Vanderklein 1996, p.&amp;nbsp;336]]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the use of leaded gasoline was largely phased out in North America by 1996, soils next to roads built before this time retain high lead concentrations. Lead (from [[lead(II) azide]] or [[lead styphnate]] used in firearms) gradually accumulates at firearms training grounds, contaminating the local environment and exposing range employees to a risk of [[lead poisoning]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Houlton|Houlton 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;50]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Entry routes ==

Heavy metals enter plant, animal and human tissues via air inhalation, diet and manual handling. Motor vehicle emissions are a major source of airborne contaminants including arsenic, cadmium, cobalt, nickel, lead, antimony, vanadium, zinc, platinum, palladium and rhodium.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bala|Balasubramanian, He &amp; Wang 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;476]]&lt;/ref&gt; Water sources (groundwater, lakes, streams and rivers) can be polluted by heavy metals leaching from industrial and consumer waste; [[acid rain]] can exacerbate this process by releasing heavy metals trapped in soils.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wors|Worsztynowicz &amp; Mill 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;361]]&lt;/ref&gt; Plants are exposed to heavy metals through the uptake of water; animals eat these plants; ingestion of plant- and animal-based foods are the largest sources of heavy metals in humans.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Radojevic|Radojevic &amp; Bashkin 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;406]]&lt;/ref&gt; Absorption through skin contact, for example from contact with soil, or metal containing toys and jewelry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guney|first1=Mert|last2=Zagury|first2=Gerald J.|title=Bioaccessibility of As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Sb in Toys and Low-Cost Jewelry|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|date=4 January 2014|volume=48|issue=2|pages=1238–1246|doi=10.1021/es4036122|bibcode=2014EnST...48.1238G}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; is another potential source of heavy metal contamination.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Qu|Qu et al. 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;144]]&lt;/ref&gt; Toxic heavy metals can [[bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in organisms as they are hard to [[Metabolism|metabolize]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pezzarossa|Pezzarossa, Gorini &amp; Petruzelli 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;94]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Detrimental effects ==

Heavy metals "can bind to vital cellular components, such as [[Protein#Structural proteins|structural proteins]], [[enzymes]], and [[nucleic acid]]s, and interfere with their functioning".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Landis|Lanids, Sofield &amp; Yu 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;269]]&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms and effects can vary according to the metal or metal compound, and the dose involved. Broadly, long-term exposure to toxic heavy metals can have carcinogenic, central and peripheral nervous system and circulatory effects. For humans, typical presentations associated with exposure to any of the "classical"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Nielen|Neilen &amp; Marvin 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;10]]&lt;/ref&gt; toxic heavy metals, or chromium (another toxic heavy metal) or arsenic (a metalloid), are shown in the table.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Afal|Afal &amp; Wiener 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The toxic effects of arsenic, mercury and lead were known to the ancients but methodical studies of the overall toxicity of heavy metals appear to date from only 1868. In that year, Wanklyn and Chapman speculated on the adverse effects of the heavy metals "arsenic, lead, copper, zinc, [[iron]] and [[manganese]]" in [[drinking water]]. They noted an "absence of investigation" and were reduced to "the necessity of pleading for the collection of data".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wanklyn|Wanklyn &amp; Chapman 1868, pp.&amp;nbsp;73–8]]; [[#Cameron|Cameron 1871, p.&amp;nbsp;484]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, Blake described an apparent connection between toxicity and the atomic weight of an element.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blake|Blake 1884]]&lt;/ref&gt; The following sections provide historical thumbnails for the "classical" toxic heavy metals (arsenic, mercury and lead) and some more recent examples (chromium and cadmium).

[[File:Orpiment mineral.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Orpiment]], a toxic arsenic mineral used in the tanning industry to remove hair from hides.]]

=== Arsenic ===

[[Arsenic]], as [[realgar]] ({{chem|As|4|S|4}}) and [[orpiment]] ({{chem|As|2|S|3}}), was known in ancient times. [[Strabo]] (64–50 BCE – c. AD 24?), a Greek geographer and historian,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dueck|Dueck 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–3, 46, 53]]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that only slaves were employed in realgar and orpiment mines since they would inevitably die from the toxic effects of the fumes given off from the ores. Arsenic-contaminated beer poisoned over 6,000 people in the Manchester area of England in 1900, and is thought to have killed at least 70 victims.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Dyer|Dyer 2009]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clare Luce]], American ambassador to Italy from 1953 to 1956, suffered from [[arsenic poisoning]]. Its source was traced to flaking arsenic-laden paint on the ceiling of her bedroom. She may also have eaten food contaminated by arsenic in flaking ceiling paint in the embassy dining room.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Whorton|Whorton 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;356]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arsenic contamination of groundwater|Ground water contaminated by arsenic]], as of 2014, "is still poisoning millions of people in Asia".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Notman|Notman 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mercury ===
[[File:Saint Isaac's Cathedral in SPB.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]], in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia. The [[gold]]-mercury [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]] used to [[gilding|gild]] its dome caused numerous casualties among the workers involved.]]
{{see also|Mercury in fish}}

The first emperor of unified China, [[Qin Shi Huang]], it is reported, died of ingesting [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] pills that were intended to give him eternal life.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Zhao|Zhao, Zhu &amp; Sui 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "mad as a hatter" is likely a reference to [[mercury poisoning]] among [[milliner]]s (so-called "[[mad hatter disease]]"), as mercury-based compounds were once used in the manufacture of felt hats in the 18th and 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Waldron|Waldron 1983]]&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, gold amalgam (an alloy with mercury) was widely used in [[gilding]], leading to numerous casualties among the workers. It is estimated that during the construction of [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] alone, 60 workers died from the gilding of the main dome.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Emsley|Emsely 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;326]]&lt;/ref&gt; Outbreaks of [[methylmercury]] poisoning occurred in several places in Japan during the 1950s due to industrial discharges of mercury into rivers and coastal waters. The best-known instances were in [[Minamata]] and [[Niigata Prefecture|Niigata]]. In Minamata alone, more than 600 people died due to what became known as [[Minamata disease]]. More than 21,000 people filed claims with the Japanese government, of which almost 3000 became certified as having the disease. In 22 documented cases, pregnant women who consumed contaminated fish showed mild or no symptoms but gave birth to infants with severe developmental disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Davidson|Davidson, Myers &amp; Weiss 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;1025]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[industrial Revolution]], mercury levels have tripled in many near-surface [[seawater]]s, especially around [[Iceland]] and [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#NS2014|New Scientist August 2014, p. 4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dutch boy collier white lead.png|thumb|left|upright|Dutch Boy [[white lead]] paint advertisement, 1912.]]

=== Lead ===

The adverse effects of [[lead]] were known to the ancients. In the 2nd century BC the Greek botanist [[Nicander]] described the [[colic]] and [[paralysis]] seen in lead-poisoned people.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pearce|Pearce 2007]]; [[#Needleman|Needleman 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides]], a Greek [[physician]] who is thought to have lived in the 1st century CE,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Rogers|Rogers 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;41]]&lt;/ref&gt; wrote that lead "makes the mind give way". Lead was used extensively in [[Roman aqueducts]] from about 500 BC to 300 AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gilbert|Gilbert &amp; Weiss 2006]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Caesar]]'s engineer, [[Vitruvius]], reported, "water is much more wholesome from earthenware pipes than from lead pipes. For it seems to be made injurious by lead, because [[white lead]] is produced by it, and this is said to be harmful to the human body."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Prioreschi|Prioreschi 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;279]]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Mongol]] period in China (1271−1368 AD), lead pollution due to silver smelting in the [[Yunnan]] region exceeded contamination levels from modern mining activities by nearly four times.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hillman|Hillman et al. 2015, pp.&amp;nbsp;3353–3354]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Up to one-sixth of China's arable land might be affected by heavy metal contamination.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hillman|Hillman et al. 2015, p.&amp;nbsp;3349]]&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} In the 17th and 18th centuries, people in [[Devon]] were afflicted by a condition referred to as [[Devon colic]]; this was discovered to be due to the imbibing of [[lead poisoning|lead-contaminated]] [[cider]]. In 2013, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated that lead poisoning resulted in 143,000 deaths, and "contribute[d] to 600,000 new cases of children with intellectual disabilities", each year.&lt;ref&gt;[[#WHO|World Health Organization 2013]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S. city of [[Flint, Michigan]], lead contamination in drinking water has been [[Flint water crisis|an issue since 2014]]. The source of the contamination has been attributed to "corrosion in the lead and iron pipes that distribute water to city residents".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Torrice|Torrice 2016]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, drinking water lead levels in north-eastern [[Tasmania]], Australia, were reported to reach over 50 times national drinking water guidelines. The source of the contamination was attributed to "a combination of dilapidated drinking water infrastructure, including lead jointed pipelines, end-of-life polyvinyl chloride pipes and household plumbing".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harvey|Harvey, Handley &amp; Taylor 2015]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chromium ===
[[File:Potassium-chromate-sample.jpg|thumb|right|[[Potassium chromate]], a [[carcinogen]], is used in the dyeing of fabrics, and as a [[Tanning (leather)|tanning agent]] to produce [[leather]].]]

[[Chromium(III)]] compounds and [[chromium]] metal are not considered a health hazard, while the toxicity and carcinogenic properties of [[chromium(VI)]] have been known since at least the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Barcelous|Barceloux &amp; Barceloux 1999]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890, Newman described the elevated cancer risk of workers in a [[chromate]] dye company.&lt;ref&gt;[[#NewmanD|Newman 1890]]&lt;/ref&gt; Chromate-induced dermatitis was reported in aircraft workers during [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Haines|Haines &amp; Nieboer 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;504]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, an outbreak of dermatitis, ranging from [[erythema]] to exudative [[eczema]], occurred amongst 60 automobile factory workers in England. The workers had been wet-sanding chromate-based primer paint that had been applied to car bodies.&lt;ref&gt;[[#National|National Research Council 1974, p.&amp;nbsp;68]]&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, chromium was released from the [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] [[Orica]] explosives plant on August 8, 2011. Up to 20 workers at the plant were exposed as were 70 nearby homes in [[Stockton, New South Wales|Stockton]]. The town was only notified three days after the release and the accident sparked a major public controversy, with Orica criticised for playing down the extent and possible risks of the leak, and the state Government attacked for their slow response to the incident.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tovey|Tovey 2011]]; [[#Jones|Jones 2011]]; [[#OB|O'Brien &amp; Aston]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cadmium ===

[[Cadmium]] exposure is a phenomenon of the early 20th century, and onwards. In Japan in 1910, the [[Mitsui Mining and Smelting Company]] began discharging cadmium into the Jinzugawa river, as a byproduct of mining operations. Residents in the surrounding area subsequently consumed rice grown in cadmium-contaminated irrigation water. They experienced softening of the bones and kidney failure. The origin of these symptoms was not clear; possibilities raised at the time included "a regional or bacterial disease or lead poisoning".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vallero|Vallero &amp; Letcher 2013, p.&amp;nbsp;240]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, cadmium was identified as the likely cause and in 1961 the source was directly linked to mining operations in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vallero|Vallero &amp; Letcher 2013, pp.&amp;nbsp;239–241]]&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, cadmium was found in [[Walmart]] exclusive [[Miley Cyrus]] jewelry. Wal-Mart continued to sell the jewelry until May, when covert testing organised by [[Associated Press]] confirmed the original results.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Pritchard|Pritchard 2010]]&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010 cadmium was detected in the paint used on promotional drinking glasses for the movie [[Shrek Forever After]], sold by [[McDonald's Restaurants]], triggering a recall of 12 million glasses.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Mulvihill|Mulvihill &amp; Pritchard 2010]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Remediation ==
[[File:Metal-EDTA.svg|thumb|right|170px|A metal EDTA anion. Pb displaces Ca in {{chem|Na|2|[CaEDTA]}} to give {{chem|Na|2|[PbEDTA]}}, which is passed out of the body in [[urine]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Csuros|Cs uros 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;124]]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In humans, heavy metal poisoning is generally treated by the administration of [[Chelation|chelating agent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Blann|Blann &amp; Ahmed 2014, p.&amp;nbsp;465]]&lt;/ref&gt;
These are chemical compounds, such as {{chem|link=EDTA|CaNa|2 EDTA}} (calcium disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate) that convert heavy metals to chemically inert forms that can be excreted without further interaction with the body. Chelates are not without side effects and can also remove beneficial metals from the body. Vitamin and mineral supplements are sometimes co-administered for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ACS|American Cancer Society 2008]]; [[#NCPC|National Capital Poison Center 2010]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Soils contaminated by heavy metals can be remediated by one or more of the following technologies: isolation; immobilization; toxicity reduction; physical separation; or extraction. ''Isolation'' involves the use of caps, membranes or below-ground barriers in an attempt to quarantine the contaminated soil. ''Immobilization'' aims to alter the properties of the soil so as to hinder the mobility of the heavy contaminants. ''Toxicity reduction'' attempts to oxidise or reduce the toxic heavy metal ions, via chemical or [[Phytoremediation|biological means]] into less toxic or mobile forms. ''Physical separation'' involves the removal of the contaminated soil and the separation of the metal contaminants by mechanical means. ''Extraction'' is an on or off-site process that uses chemicals, high-temperature volatization, or electrolysis to extract contaminants from soils. The process or processes used will vary according to contaminant and the characteristics of the site.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Evanko|Evanko &amp; Dzombak 1997, pp.&amp;nbsp;1, 14–40]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits ==

Some elements otherwise regarded as toxic heavy metals are [[dietary element|essential]], in small quantities, for human health. These elements include vanadium, manganese, iron, cobalt, copper, zinc, selenium, strontium and molybdenum.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bánfalvi|Bánfalvi 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;12]]&lt;/ref&gt; A deficiency of these essential metals may increase susceptibility to heavy metal poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Chowdhury|Chowdhury 1987]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Vegetative Treatment System''' (VTS) is a combination of treatment steps for managing [[Surface runoff|runoff]]. It treats runoff by settling, [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrating]], and nutrient usage. Individual components of a VTS include, a settling structure, an outlet structure, a distribution system, and a Vegetative Treatment Area (VTA). All these components when used together are considered to be a Vegetative Treatment System.

==Introduction==
A '''Vegetative Treatment System (VTS)''' is a new alternative treatment option for treating the runoff from an [[animal feeding operation]] in an effort to protect water quality in [[South Dakota]] (SD). A VTS consists of a [[sediment basin]] to settle the solids from the feedlot, and uses controlled release of the liquids to a vegetated treatment area (VTA).

The VTA area is commonly confused with vegetative buffer (or filter) strips. A [[buffer strip]] is a narrow strip of vegetation (usually 30–60 feet wide) between cropland or a water source, such as a [[river]], [[lake]], or [[stream]]. In contrast, a VTA is a specifically sized area of [[Perennial plant|perennial]] vegetation to which runoff from a [[barnyard]] or [[feedlot]] is applied uniformly. The VTA utilizes the water holding capacity of the soil to store the runoff water until the nutrients and water can be used by the vegetation. Therefore, the application of the runoff to the VTA must be at a rate to prevent deep percolation below the root zone, and not allow the flow to extend past the end of the VTA.

A '''VTS''' can be an economical alternative to runoff retention (holding) ponds for controlling runoff from an open lot feeding production system ([[feedlot]]s). A Vegetative Treatment Area (VTA) is an area of perennial vegetation, such as a grass or a forage. The VTA is used to treat runoff from a feedlot or barnyard. It treats runoff by settling, infiltration, and nutrient use.  Runoff passes through buffers with some “filtering” of pollutants, but no attempt is made to control solids or flow. A VTS, however, collects runoff from a barnyard or feedlot, separates the solids from the liquids, and uniformly distributes the liquid over the vegetated area. Little or no runoff should leave a VTA.

Runoff is first collected from an open lot or barnyard area in a [[sediment]] settling structure, usually a basin. Such basins are very effective for removing most solids. The runoff then flows into a VTA where the  soil treats and stores the runoff. Once the runoff is in the soil, natural processes allow plants to use the nutrients. The general idea behind VTS technology is that the plants will take up the nutrients contained in the runoff and that natural processes will eliminate undesirable components such as pathogens. There are many different types of VTA’s such as level, infiltration basins, sloped, sprinkler, dual and multiple systems, etc.

A Vegetative Treatment System can be used to manage runoff from open lots of both [[Animal feeding operation|AFOs]] and [[CAFO]]s. VTS systems for large [[CAFO]]s can be permitted under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ([[Clean Water Act|NPDES]]) in the US.

==Advantages==
* May provide lower initial investment and operating costs
*  More aesthetically palatable than large ponds 
* No long-term storage of runoff required, such as holding or evaporation ponds 
*  Fewer safety issues 
* Land designated for VTA can produce usable forage

==Disadvantages==
* A VTA may not be a “closed” system;
*  Saturated soils from previous rains could allow a discharge 
*  Special management required during runoff events
*  The VTAs can be damaged by a lack of maintenance and attention - gullies, erosion, and poor vegetation stands dramatically reduce their effectiveness 
*  Not currently permittable in SD by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources 
*  The VTAs may not provide the same level of water quality improvement as a total runoff containment system, such as holding or evaporation ponds provide

In the following year he began working on English dictionaries, together with [[Semyon Boyanus]].

The exact date of Müller's death is unknown. It is believed that both Vladimir Müller and his wife died during the [[siege of Leningrad]] in 1941.&lt;ref name="Yermolovich"/&gt; Müller's wife was an art scholar and worked in the [[National Library of Russia]].&lt;ref name ="Muller"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3168">The '''World Conference on Breeding Endangered Species in Captivity as an Aid to their Survival (WCBESCAS)''' is the world's first conference on [[captive breeding]]. Started by the [[Fauna and Flora Preservation Society]], due to efforts by the famous naturalist and pioneer of captive breeding [[Gerald Durrell]], the first conference was held in 1972 at [[Jersey]] (the location of Durrell's [[Durrell Wildlife Park|Jersey Zoo]], one of the few [[zoo]]s of the world to practise captive breeding at that time). The conference provided a common scientific meeting ground for captive breeding issues for the first time. The conference has been held at:
*1st WCBESCAS; [[Jersey]], 1972
*2nd WCBESCAS; [[London]], 1976
*3rd WCBESCAS; [[San Diego]], 1979
*4th WCBESCAS; [[Harderwijk]], 1984
*5th WCBESCAS; [[Cincinnati]], 1988
*6th WCBESCAS; [[Jersey]], 1992, 'The Roles of Zoos in Global Conservation'
*7th WCBESCAS; [[Cincinnati]], 1999, 'Linking Zoos and Field Research to Advance Conservation'
