'''''Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament''''' edited by [[James B. Pritchard]] (1st ed. 1950, 2nd ed.1955, 3rd ed. 1969}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancient Near Eastern texts relating to the Old Testament. Edited by James B. Pritchard.

In spite of the name, the included texts have broad coverage and do not necessarily relate to the [[Old Testament]]. [[William Wolfgang Hallo|William W. Hallo]], writing in the ''[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]]'' in 1970, described it as "a modern classic ever since its first appearance in 1950", because "for the first time it assembled some of the most significant Ancient Near Eastern texts in authoritative, generously annotated English translations based on the accumulated insight of several generations of scholarship scattered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=William W. |last=Hallo|publisher=[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]]|title=Review: The Ancient Near East Supplementary Texts and Pictures Relating to the Old Testament Consisting of Supplementary Materials for The Ancient Near East In Pictures and Ancient Near Eastern Texts by James B.

{{Anthropology}}
'''Applied anthropology''' refers to the application of the method and theory of [[anthropology]] to the analysis and solution of practical problems. In ''Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application'', Kedia and Van Willigen define the process as a "complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kedia, Satish|first=and Willigen J. Van|title=Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application|year=2005|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn|pages=16, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, applied anthropology is the praxis-based side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and [[activism]] within the participating [[community]].

==Spanning academic disciplines==
The [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA) website describes anthropology as a focus on "the study of humans, past and present. To understand the full sweep and complexity of cultures across all of human history, anthropology draws and builds upon knowledge from the social and biological sciences as well as the humanities and physical sciences." Thus, the field is divided into four subareas: [[sociocultural anthropology]], [[Biological anthropology|biological (or physical) anthropology]], [[archaeology]], and [[linguistic anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=American Anthropological Association|title=What is Anthropology?|url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because a central tenet of the anthropological field is the application of shared knowledge and research about humans across the world, an anthropologist who specializes in any of these areas and enacts research into direct action and/or policy can be deemed an "applied anthropologist". Indeed, some practical problems may invoke all sub-disciplines. For example, a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] community development program may involve archaeological research to determine legitimacy of water rights claims, ethnography to assess the current and historical cultural characteristics of the community, linguistics to restore language competence among inhabitants, medical anthropology to determine the causality of dietary deficiency diseases, etc.

==Professional engagement==
Applied anthropologists often work for nonacademic clients, such as [[government]]s, development agencies, [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), [[Tribe|tribal]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] associations, [[advocacy group]]s, social-service and educational agencies, and businesses. It is also not uncommon for an anthropologist to initiate activist work surrounding his or her own area of study; frequently, sociocultural anthropological studies begin as mere research inquiries that blossom into community advocacy projects, and even new specialized NGOs.

Applied anthropologist methodology includes, but is not limited to, [[ethnography]], [[participant observation]], [[snowball sampling|snowballing]], interviews, and [[focus group]]s. They also use [[textual analysis]], surveying, [[archival research]], and other empirical methods to inform policy or to market products.

==Problems and criticisms==
The process of conducting anthropological research and then applying knowledge in attempts to ameliorate the lives of research participants can be problematic, and is often laced with elements of [[Orientalism]] and/or [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Said|first=Edward W.|title=Orientalism|year=1994|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kedia and Van Willigen describe the moral dilemma embedded in this work: "The ethical requirements of applied anthropology are especially challenging since the practitioner must negotiate an intricate balance between the interests of the clients who commission the work, and those of the community being studied." The authors continue by stating that this negotiation leads to issues of privacy, ownership, and the implications and purposes of the study being produced (p.&amp;nbsp;16). 

Although guidelines for ethicalities of applied anthropology are put forth by major anthropological organizations—including the American Anthropological Association (AAA), the [[Society for Applied Anthropology]] (SFAA), and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA)—it is increasingly difficult to ensure that the high volume of worldwide anthropologists proceed with their research in ways that are both culturally relative and sensitive to community needs. Kedia and Van Willigen describe the myriad roles an applied anthropologist must play as effective resource for communities in need; a researcher must be an advocate, cultural "broker", evaluator, policy researcher, public participation specialist, and research analyst. 

The multinational phenomenon of [[female genital cutting]] (FGC) exemplifies the necessity for an anthropologist to account for relative cultural contexts: "The work of scholars who stress the fundamental importance of offering perspectives on cultural factors that promote the practice of female genital cutting has brought the debate surrounding cultural relativism into sharp focus. Greunbaum (1996) notes that analyses that ''do'' offer [[Emic and etic|emic]] interpretations and cultural contextualizations are often criticized as bordering on advocacy for the practice" [emphasis in original].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shell-Duncan, Bettina|first=and Ylva Hernlund|title=Female "circumcision" in Africa: Culture, Controversy, and Change|year=2000|publisher=Lynne Rienner|location=Boulder|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these instances, it is imperative that an anthropologist not cloud his or her own preconceived notions about health and gender relations in an attempt to "remedy" a complex social issue.

==Debates about objectivity in anthropology==
The field of anthropology is also fraught with debate surrounding accurate and effective approaches to conducting research. More specifically, there is continued debate about the essentiality of [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] in anthropological fieldwork. Some [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] scholars contend that it is impossible to remove one's own preconceived cultural notions from one's work. In this line of thought, it is more productive to recognize that anthropologists are themselves culturally programmed observers, and must always be wary of biases that influence information they receive. In contrast, the [[Positivism|positivist]] approach to anthropology emphasizes the necessity for 
an objective, regimented, and scientific approach to anthropological research.

==Scholarly works and organizations==
The premiere journal of applied anthropology in the United States is called ''[[Human Organization]]'', published by the Society for Applied Anthropology. In the UK, the main journal for applied anthropology is called ''[[Anthropology in Action]]''.

Under the directorship of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute]], Jonathan Benthall (author of ''The Best of Anthropology Today'') created the annual [[Lucy Mair]] Medal of Applied Anthropology. This recognizes excellence in using anthropology "for the relief of poverty or distress, or for the active recognition of human dignity".

The Association of Social Anthropologists (ASA) has a network of Applied Anthropologists known as "Apply". Within the [[European Association of Social Anthropologists]] (EASA), there is the [http://www.applied-anthropology.com/ Applied Anthropology Network], which annually organises the international symposium Why the World Needs Anthropologists. Theme of the first symposium was New Fields for Applied Anthropology in Europe (Amsterdam, 2013), of the second Coming Out of the Ivory Tower (Padua, 2014), of the third Burning Issues of Our Hot Planet (Ljubljana, 2015), of the fourth Humanise IT (Tartu, 2016), of the fifth Powering the Planet (Durham, 2017), and of the sixth Designing the Future (Lisbon, 2018). Within the EASA [[Medical anthropology|Medical Anthropology]] Network, there is also an applied anthropology special interest group.

There are three primary groups based out of the US that are founded on the application of anthropology with acute attention to ethics and social implications: American Anthropological Association (AAA), Society for Applied Anthropology (SFAA), and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA).

'''BACnet''' is a [[communications protocol]] for Building Automation and Control (BAC) networks that leverage the [[ASHRAE]], [[ANSI]], and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 16484-5 standard&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | authorlink = ASHRAE
 | title = Standard 135-2016-- BACnet--A Data Communication Protocol for Building Automation and Control Networks (ANSI Approved)
 | date = 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; protocol.

BACnet was designed to allow communication of [[building automation]] and control systems for applications such as heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning control ([[HVAC]]), lighting control, access control, and fire detection systems and their associated equipment. The BACnet protocol provides mechanisms for computerized building automation devices to exchange information, regardless of the particular building service they perform.

==History==
The development of the BACnet protocol began in June, 1987, in Nashville, Tennessee, at the inaugural meeting of the ASHRAE BACnet committee, known at that time as SPC 135P, "EMCS Message Protocol".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bacnet.org/DL-Docs/SPC135-Nashville-Minutes-1987-06.pdf |title=Minutes of the First SPC 135P Meeting|author=SPC 135P |date=June 26, 1987|publisher=ASHRAE |access-date=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee worked at reaching consensus using working groups to divide up the task of creating a standard. The working groups focused on specific areas and provided information and recommendations to the main committee. The first three working groups were the Data Type and Attribute Working Group, Primitive Data Format Working Group, and the Application Services Working Group.

BACnet became ASHRAE/ANSI Standard 135 in 1995, and [http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=37298 ISO 16484-5] in 2003. The Method of Test for Conformance to BACnet was published in 2003 as BSR/ASHRAE Standard 135.1. BACnet is under continuous maintenance by the ASHRAE Standing Standard Project Committee 135.

BACnet had an almost immediate impact on the [[HVAC]] controls industry. In 1996 [[Alerton]] announced a complete BACnet product line for HVAC controls, from the operator's workstation down to small [[variable air volume]] (VAV) controllers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RbLQj6tWJzAC|title=BACnet|last=Newman|first=Michael|publisher=Momentum Press|year=2013|isbn=9781606502907|location=New York|pages=|chapter=2.9.1 ALERTON|oclc=909981984|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Automated Logic Corporation]] and Delta Controls soon followed suit. On July 12, 2017 BACnet reached a milestone with the issuance of the 1000th Vendor ID. Vendor IDs are assigned by ASHRAE and are distributed internationally. Those vendor identifiers can be viewed at [http://www.bacnet.org/VendorID/BACnet%20Vendor%20IDs.htm the BACnet website].

H. Michael (Mike) Newman, Manager of the Computer Section of the Utilities and Energy Management Department at [[Cornell University]], served as the BACnet committee chairman until June, 2000, when he was succeeded by his vice-chair of 13 years, Steven (Steve) Bushby from [[NIST]]. 

During Steve Bushby's four-year term as committee chair the BACnet standard was republished twice, in 2001 and 2004, each time with new capabilities added to the standard. The 2001 version featured, among other things, extensions to support fire / life-safety systems. 

In June, 2004, 17 years after the first BACnet meeting and back in Nashville, William (Bill) Swan (a.k.a. "BACnet Bill") from Alerton began his four-year stint as committee chair. During his term the number of committee working groups grew to 11, pursuing areas such as support for lighting, access control, energy utility/building integration and wireless communications.  

In January 2006 the BACnet Manufacturers Association and the BACnet Interest Group of North America combined their operation in a new organization called [http://www.bacnetinternational.org/ BACnet International].

In June 2008, in Salt Lake City, Dave Robin from Automated Logic Corporation took over the reins as the new committee chair after serving 4 years as vice chair. During Dave's term, 22 addenda were published for the 135-2008 standard and republished as 135-2010. Several addenda were published for 135-2010 and the standard was republished as 135-2012. 

In June 2012, in San Antonio, Carl Neilson from Delta Controls took over the reins as the new committee chair after serving 4 years as vice chair.

==Protocol overview==
The BACnet protocol defines a number of services that are used to communicate between building devices. The protocol services include Who-Is, I-Am, Who-Has, I-Have, which are used for Device and Object discovery. Services such as Read-Property and Write-Property are used for data sharing. As of ANSI/ASHRAE 135-2016, the BACnet protocol defines 60 object types that are acted upon by the services. 

The BACnet protocol defines a number of data link / physical layers, including [[ARCNET]], [[Ethernet]], BACnet/IP, BACnet/IPv6, [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|Point-To-Point]] over [[RS-232]], Master-Slave/Token-Passing over [[RS-485]], [[ZigBee]], and [[LonTalk]].

==BACnet objects==
ANSI/ASHRAE 135-2016 specifies 60 standard object types:

==BACnet testing==
BACnet Testing Laboratories ("BTL") was established by BACnet International to test products as per BACnet standard and support compliance testing and interoperability testing activities and consists of BTL Manager and the BTL working group ("BTL-WG").
The general activities of the BTL are:
*Publish the BTL Implementation Guidelines document
*Certifying the products as per BACnet testing and BTL guidelines
*Support the activities of the BTL-WG
*Maintain the BTL test packages
*Approves Testing Laboratories for BTL Testing
The BTL also provides testing services through BACnet Laboratories. The BTL Managers and BTL working groups of BACnet International administer the test Laboratories. All BTL-recognized BACnet Test Organizations are [[ISO 17025]] accredited.

In January, 2017, a new BTL certification program was announced. Under this program, the work of the BTL and WSPCert (the European BACnet certification body) is merged. This merger forms a single point of testing for both the BTL Mark and the Certificate of Conformance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6529">The '''Berliner Elektronenspeicherring-Gesellschaft für Synchrotronstrahlung [[GmbH|m. b. H.]]''' (''English'': Berlin [[Electron]] [[Storage ring|Storage Ring]] Society for [[Synchrotron Radiation]]), abbreviated ''BESSY'', is a research establishment in the [[Adlershof]] district of [[Berlin]]. Founded on 5 March 1979, it currently operates one of Germany's 3rd generation [[synchrotron|synchrotron radiation facilities]], '''BESSY II'''. Originally part of the [[Leibniz Association]], BESSY now belongs to the [[Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin]] (since 1 January 2009).

Owing to the [[radiometry]] lab of the PTB [http://www.bessy.de/?idart=86&amp;changelang=5], BESSY is the European calibration standard for [[electromagnetic radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/user/photons/index_en.html |title=BESSY webpage: About BESSY - an ultimate space and time microscope |access-date=2010-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230071314/http://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/user/photons/index_en.html |archive-date=2010-12-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BESSY supplies synchrotron light and provides support for science and industry. There are institutional long-time users, like the [[Max-Planck-Gesellschaft|Max-Planck-Society]], the [[Bundesanstalt für Materialforschung und -prüfung|German Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing]] (BAM) and the national [[metrology]] institute of Germany (the [[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt|PTB]]). Furthermore, research groups from other institutes or universities can apply for utilization (so called ''beam time'') for certain projects.

== BESSY I ==
[[Image:BESSY I.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The BESSY I building seen in 1996]]
This original synchrotron facility, costing the equivalent of 66.5 million [[Euro]], became operational on 19 December 1981. It was situated in [[Wilmersdorf]], then a [[Boroughs and localities of Berlin|borough of Berlin]]. The storage ring had a circumference of approx. 60 m. The circulating electrons that provided the radiation were in the energy range of 200 to 800 [[Electron volt|MeV]] ([[Vacuum UV|Vacuum Ultraviolet]] through [[Extreme ultraviolet|Extreme Ultraviolet]]).

After its decommissioning in 1999, the component parts of the BESSY I machine were donated to the [[Synchrotron-Light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East|SESAME project]] by the German Authorities and have consequently been shipped to [[Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/science/en/ev.php-URL_ID=1957&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html Transportation of BESSY I Component Parts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous achievements of BESSY I were the [[calibration]] of the [[spectrometers]] for the solar observatory probe [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory|SOHO]] as well as for the detectors for the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]].

== BESSY II ==
Groundbreaking for the new improved BESSY II synchrotron source in Adlershof took place on 4 July 1994, and the facility was inaugurated on 4 September 1998. The project cost was an equivalent of approximately 100 million Euros.  The successor of BESSY I has a circumference of 240 m, providing 46 [[beam line]]s, and offers a multi-faceted mixture of experimental opportunities ([[undulator]], [[Wiggler (synchrotron)|wiggler]] and [[dipole magnet|dipole]] sources) with excellent energy resolution. The combination of [[brightness]] and time resolution enables both [[femtosecond]] time and [[picometer]] spatial resolutions.

Electrons can be accelerated to an energy of up to 1.7 [[Electron Volt|GeV]] ([[X-rays|X-ray regime]]), and are subsequently injected into the storage ring. Synchrotron radiation emerges from the dipole magnets that bend the beam on a circular path, as well as from undulators and wigglers. The total [[Power (physics)|power]] input during regular operation is 2.7 [[Watt|MW]].

BESSY II can be run in different modes, according to the time-distance between the electron [[wave packet]]s that circulate in the storage ring:
* '''multi bunch''': This is the most common mode. Around 350 equal packets are in the ring, with a time-distance of 2 [[nanosecond|ns]]
* '''single bunch''': This mode is in effect for two weeks each half-year. Only one single electron packet is in the ring, thus enabling the users to measure with the highest possible time resolution. Two light pulses arrive with a gap of 800 ns and can therefore be easily separated.
* '''low alpha''': This mode exists in single and multi bunch sub-modes. The spatial resolution of the electron packet is higher (it is compressed), which leads to a higher rate of Terahertz radiation and shorter light pulses.

Experiments at BESSY II are in the fields of [[X-ray absorption spectroscopy]], [[Photoemission spectroscopy]], [[Photoemission electron microscopy]], [[X-ray microscope|X-ray microscopy]], [[laser cutting|femtosecond slicing]], [[X-ray lithography]], and [[X-ray crystallography|protein structure analysis]].

BESSY maintains a close co-operation with other synchrotron sources in the world, most notably with [[DESY]] in [[Hamburg]].

==Other facilities==
*In September 2008, the '''Metrology Light Source (MLS)''' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ptb.de/mls/&lt;/ref&gt; was inaugurated. This facility in close proximity to BESSY II is run by PTB and provides synchrotron radiation in the energy range of [[far infrared]] and [[Terahertz radiation]]. The two facilities complement one another.
*In 2000, the construction of a [[free electron laser]] on the BESSY site was planned, which was dubbed '''BESSY-FEL''' &lt;ref&gt;https://www.helmholtz-berlin.de/aktuell/pm/pm-archiv/2006/bestnoten-fuer-das-bessy-fel-projekt_de.html&lt;/ref&gt;. It was supposed to create extremely short and bright ultraviolet and X-ray pulses. In the autumn of 2008, the project was cut, and only an extension to the [[FLASH]] free electron laser in Hamburg is now to be built.

'''Chloracne''' is an [[Acne vulgaris|acne]]-like eruption of [[blackhead]]s, [[cyst]]s, and [[pustule]]s associated with over-exposure to certain [[halogen]]ated [[aromatic compound]]s, such as chlorinated [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]] and [[Polychlorinated dibenzofurans|dibenzofurans]]. The [[lesion]]s are most frequently found on the cheeks, behind the ears, in the armpits and groin region.

The condition was first described in German industrial workers in 1897 by Siegfried Bettmann,&lt;ref&gt;Siegfried Bettmann (1869–1939), University of Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt; and was initially believed to be caused by exposure to [[chlorine]] (hence the name "chloracne"). It was only in the mid-1950s that chloracne was associated with aromatic hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Williams DE, Wolfe WH, Lustik MB |year=1995 |title=An Epidemiologic Investigation of Health Effects in Air Force Personnel Following Exposure to Herbicides |volume=4 |page=427 |publisher= |id=A313403 |url=http://www.stormingmedia.us/31/3134/A313403.html |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The substances that may cause chloracne are now collectively known as '''chloracnegens'''.

Chloracne is particularly linked to toxic exposure to [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]]s ([[byproduct]]s of many [[chemical process]]es, including the manufacture of [[herbicides]] such as [[Agent Orange]])&amp;mdash;so much so that it is considered a clinical sign of dioxin exposure. The severity and onset of chloracne may follow a typical [[asymptotic]] [[dose-response relationship]] [[curve]].

==Cause==
Chloracne normally results from direct skin contact with chloracnegens, although ingestion and [[inhalation]] are also possible causative routes.

Chloracnegens are [[fat-soluble]], meaning they persist in the body fat for a very long period following exposure. Chloracne is a chronic [[inflammation|inflammatory]] condition that results from this persistence, in combination with the toxin's chemical properties. It is believed, at least from [[rodent]] models, that the [[toxin]] activates a series of [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] promoting [[macrophage]] proliferation, inducing [[neutrophilia]] and leading to a generalised inflammatory response in the skin. This process may also be augmented by induction of excess [[Tumor necrosis factors|tumor necrosis factor]] in the [[blood]] [[blood plasma|serum]].

The inflammatory processes lead to the formation of [[keratin]]ous plugs in skin pores, forming yellowish [[cyst]]s and dark [[pustule]]s. The associated [[pus]] is usually a color of green approximating that of a tennis ball. The skin lesions occur mainly in the face, but in more severe cases they involve the shoulders and chest, the back, and the abdomen. In advanced cases, the lesions appear also on the arms, neck, thighs, legs, hands and feet.

In some instances, chloracne may not appear for three to four weeks after toxic exposure; however, in other cases&amp;mdash;particularly in events of massive exposure&amp;mdash;the symptoms may appear within days.&lt;ref name="ref1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=De Marchia B, Ravetzb JR |title=Risk management and governance: a post-normal science approach |journal=Futures |volume=31 |issue=7 |pages=743–57 |year=1999 |doi=10.1016/S0016-3287(99)00030-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Once chloracne has been identified, the primary action is to remove the patient and all other individuals from the source of contamination. Further treatment is [[symptomatic]].

Secondary infections on severe or persistent lesions may need to be treated with oral [[antibiotics]] or [[isotretinoin]]. However, chloracne itself can be highly resistant to any treatment.

The course of the disease is highly variable. In some cases the lesions may disappear within two years or so; however, in other cases the lesions may be effectively permanent (mean duration of lesions in one 1984 study was 26 years, with some workers remaining disfigured over three decades after exposure).&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moses M, Lilis R, Crow KD |title=Health status of workers with past exposure to 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin in the manufacture of 2,4,5-trichlorophenoxyacetic acid: comparison of findings with and without chloracne |journal=Am.

Chloracne is very often seen in combination with [[hyperhidrosis]] (clammy, sweaty skin) and [[porphyria cutanea tarda]] (a skin condition of increased pigmentation, hair coarsening and blistering).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18474">'''Cognitive ecology''' is the study of cognitive phenomena within social and natural contexts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hutchins|first=Edwin|date=2010-10-01|title=Cognitive Ecology|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2010.01089.x/abstract|journal=Topics in Cognitive Science|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=705–715|doi=10.1111/j.1756-8765.2010.01089.x|issn=1756-8765}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an integrative perspective drawing from aspects of [[ecological psychology]], [[cognitive science]], [[evolutionary ecology]] and [[anthropology]]. Notions of domain-specific [[Modularity of mind|modules in the brain]] and the cognitive biases they create are central to understanding the [[Enactivism|enacted]] nature of cognition within a cognitive ecological framework. This means that cognitive mechanisms not only shape the characteristics of thought, but they dictate the success of [[Dual inheritance theory|culturally transmitted ideas]]. Because [[Dual inheritance theory|culturally transmitted]] concepts can often inform ecological decision-making behaviors, group-level trends in cognition (i.e., culturally salient concepts) are hypothesized to address ecologically relevant challenges.&lt;ref name="botero"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Botero|first1=Carlos A.|last2=Gardner|first2=Beth|last3=Kirby|first3=Kathryn R.|last4=Bulbulia|first4=Joseph|last5=Gavin|first5=Michael C.|last6=Gray|first6=Russell D.|title=The ecology of religious beliefs|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=25 November 2014|volume=111|issue=47|pages=16784–16789|doi=10.1073/pnas.1408701111|pmc=4250141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theoretical basis ==
Cognitive ecology explores the interactive relationship between organism-environment interactions and its impact on cognitive phenomena.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Human cognition in this framework is multimodal and viewed similarly to [[Enactivism|enactivist]] perspectives on cognitive processing. For cultural concepts, this emphasizes cognitive distribution across an ecosystem, which is predicated on models of the [[extended mind thesis]].

=== Ecological psychology ===
While the multi-faceted nature of cognitive ecology is a consequence of its interdisciplinary history, it primarily derives from early work in ecological psychology. Paradigm shifts from behaviorist orientations of psychology to cognition, or the "cognitive revolution",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=George A|title=The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=March 2003|volume=7|issue=3|pages=141–144|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00029-9|pmid=12639696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="neisser"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Neisser|first1=Ulric|title=Cognitive psychology.|date=1967|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=New York|isbn=978-0131396678}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave rise to the ecological psychology approach, which distanced itself from mainstream [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivist]] views by breaking down the common mind-environment dichotomy of psychological theory.&lt;ref name=":heft"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heft|first1=Harry|title=An ecological approach to psychology.|journal=Review of General Psychology|date=2013|volume=17|issue=2|pages=162–167|doi=10.1037/a0032928}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One particularly influential progenitor of this work was ecological psychologist [[James J. Gibson|James Gibson]], whose legacy is marked by his ideas on ecological and social [[affordance]]s. These are the opportunistic features of environmental objects that can be exploited for human use, and are therefore particularly perceptible (e.g., a knob affords twisting, an agreeable social cue affords a warm reaction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chemero|first1=Anthony|title=An outline of a theory of affordances|journal=Ecological Psychology|date=2003|volume=15|issue=2|pages=181–195|doi=10.1207/s15326969eco1502_5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson argued further that organisms cannot be disentangled from their environments, and that their cognitive constraints were consequences of a limited set of environmental invariants which shaped them over evolutionary time.&lt;ref name=":heft" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=James J.|title=The ecological approach to visual perception|date=1986|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York|isbn=0898599598|edition=[Nachdr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; An illustrative example for Gibson is the human capacity for three-dimensional visual perception, which he argues is a cognitive concept resulting from the way that people interact with their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gibson|first1=James|title=The Ecological Approach to Visual Perception|date=1979|isbn=978-1848725782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another foreshadowed element of cognitive ecological theory comes from ecological anthropologist [[Gregory Bateson]], who considered the notion of informational feedback loops between mind and environment, particularly their role in generating meaning and awareness of one's surroundings. In an essay, he speculates on how an observer might best delineate the "self" of a blind man. In his treatment, he questions whether one may arbitrarily choose to carve out the man's informational processing loop at his brain or his hands or his walking stick without offering an incomplete view of his cognitive process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bateson|first1=Gregory|title=Steps to an ecology of mind|date=2000|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago [u.a.]|isbn=0-226-03905-6|edition=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; This discussion of concept remains influential in modern cognitive ecological considerations of the densely interconnected elements of ecology that play relevant roles in cognition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Enactivism ===
An enactive perspective of cognition is fundamental to a cognitive ecological view.&lt;ref name=":enactive"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Palacios|first1=AG|last2=Bozinovic|first2=F|title=An "enactive" approach to integrative and comparative biology: thoughts on the table.|journal=Biological research|date=2003|volume=36|issue=1|pages=101–5|pmid=12795209|doi=10.4067/s0716-97602003000100008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than a passive interpretation of internally represented information, cognition is considered to be an active process involving the transformation of information into meaningful relationships between the organism and its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Noë|first1=Alva|title=Action in perception|date=2004|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=0262140888|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; For humans then, a perceived environment is only constructed insofar as cognitive constraints will allow. In other words, they "enact a world" by building perspectives out of ecological information, using their evolved cognitive equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stewart|first1=edited by John|last2=Gapenne,|first2=Olivier|last3=Paolo|first3=Ezequiel A. Di|title=Enaction Toward a New Paradigm for Cognitive Science.|date=2014|publisher=Bradford Books|isbn=978-0262526012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extended cognition ==
Cognitive ecology borrows ideas from views of [[extended cognition]], as articulated by Chalmers and Clark (1998). They argue that humans cognitively utilize elements of their environment to aid the cognitive process and further entangle the mind-environment relationship as a result. They illustrate their claim with a hypothetical example of two people who achieve the same navigational success through a museum by different means; a person with Alzheimer's may use a notebook with written directions, while another may use her memory. The primary difference between the two people is that the former outsourced his memory to readily available external representations of information about the museum, whereas the latter relied on internal representations. A variant of this concept they also consider is socially extended cognition, which is a similar outsourcing of cognitive representations into other peoples' minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clark|first1=A.|last2=Chalmers|first2=D.|title=The Extended Mind|journal=Analysis|date=1 January 1998|volume=58|issue=1|pages=7–19|doi=10.1093/analys/58.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas elaborate a cognitive interpretation of broader anthropological notions maintaining that humans are a species deeply entangled in social and material elements of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hodder|first1=Ian|title=Entangled. ; An Archaeology of the Relationships Between Humans and Things.|date=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Incorporated|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-470-67212-9|edition=first publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distributed cognition ===
[[Distributed cognition]] is an important model of the extended mind thesis for cognitive ecological theory put forth by Edwin Hutchins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hutchins|first1=Edwin|title=Distributed cognition|journal=International Encyclopedia of the Social &amp; Behavioral Sciences|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cogwild"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutchins|first1=Edwin|title=Cognition in the wild|date=1996|publisher=The MIT Press (A Bradford Book)|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262581462|edition=8. pr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conceptualizes human groups as active networks with cognitive properties of their own, much like neural networks themselves yield emergent cognitive properties. For a social group, cognitive properties are disseminated into an individual's surrounding network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heylighen|first1=Heath|author2=Van Overwalle|title=The Emergence of Distributed Cognition: a conceptual framework|journal=Proceedings of Collective Intentionality IV|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cognitive properties of a group, Hutchins notes, is completely distinct from a given those of an individual.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Distributed cognition is fundamentally contingent on and emergent from trending ideas among a collection of brains and artefacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=Ellis|title=Distributed Cognition: an alternative framework for analysing and explaining collaborative working|journal=Journal of Information Technology|date=1994|volume=9|issue=2|pages=119–128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is conceptually similar to models of collective cognition in other social animal groups, which use [[Agent-based model|agent based models]] to understanding insect swarming, fish schooling, bird flocking and baboon pack behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Strandburg-Peshkin|first1=A.|last2=Farine|first2=D. R.|last3=Couzin|first3=I. D.|last4=Crofoot|first4=M. C.|title=Shared decision-making drives collective movement in wild baboons|journal=Science|date=18 June 2015|volume=348|issue=6241|pages=1358–1361|doi=10.1126/science.aaa5099|pmid=26089514|pmc=4801504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="couzin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Couzin|first1=Iain D.|title=Collective cognition in animal groups|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=January 2009|volume=13|issue=1|pages=36–43|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2008.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Couzin|first1=Iain|title=Collective minds|journal=Nature|date=15 February 2007|volume=445|issue=7129|pages=715–715|doi=10.1038/445715a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collective cognition in social animal groups is adaptive because the group can amplify its overall responsiveness to ecological cues.&lt;ref name="couzin" /&gt; Likewise, the computational power of a human group can be more effective than that of even its best individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clément|first1=Romain J. G.|last2=Krause|first2=Stefan|last3=von Engelhardt|first3=Nikolaus|last4=Faria|first4=Jolyon J.|last5=Krause|first5=Jens|last6=Kurvers|first6=Ralf H. J. M.|last7=de Polavieja|first7=GonzaloÂ G.|title=Collective Cognition in Humans: Groups Outperform Their Best Members in a Sentence Reconstruction Task|journal=PLoS ONE|date=17 October 2013|volume=8|issue=10|pages=e77943|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0077943|pmid=24147101|pmc=3798465}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea is echoed by anthropologists noting the [[collective intentionality]] of cultural institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tomasello|first1=Michael|last2=Melis|first2=Alicia P.|last3=Tennie|first3=Claudio|last4=Wyman|first4=Emily|last5=Herrmann|first5=Esther|title=Two Key Steps in the Evolution of Human Cooperation|journal=Current Anthropology|date=December 2012|volume=53|issue=6|pages=673–692|doi=10.1086/668207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Existing models of cultural learning dynamics seem to articulate the mechanisms by which information is acquired by and distributed within groups. In particular, [[cultural evolution]] theorists assert that individual learning is required for tracking environmental dynamics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henrich|first1=Joseph|last2=McElreath|first2=Richard|title=The evolution of cultural evolution|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews|date=19 May 2003|volume=12|issue=3|pages=123–135|doi=10.1002/evan.10110}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this information is retained in culture by social learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boyd|first1=R.|last2=Richerson|first2=P. J.|last3=Henrich|first3=J.|title=The cultural niche: Why social learning is essential for human adaptation|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=20 June 2011|volume=108|issue=Supplement_2|pages=10918–10925|doi=10.1073/pnas.1100290108|pmid=21690340|pmc=3131818}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Hutchins, this theoretical similarity is not a coincidence. After describing distributed cognitive networks and their relationships with ecological dynamics as "cognitive ecosystems", he defines culture as a "shorthand way of referring to a complex cognitive ecosystem."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Applications to cultural concepts ==

=== Religious beliefs ===
{{main|Cognitive ecology of religion}}
Religious behaviors typically exist in the form of ritual and correspond to religious god concepts.&lt;ref name="pursosis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purzycki &amp; Sosis|editor1-last=Ulrich|editor1-first=Frey|title=Essential Building Blocks of Human Nature|date=2011|chapter=Our Gods: Variation in Supernatural Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt; These behaviors are phenotypic outcomes of god concepts that are ultimately subject to natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Codding|first1=Brian F.|last2=Bird|first2=Douglas W.|title=Behavioral ecology and the future of archaeological science|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=April 2015|volume=56|pages=9–20|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2015.02.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cronk|first1=Lee|title=Human Behavioral Ecology|journal=Annual Review of Anthropology|date=1991|volume=20|issue=1|pages=25–53|doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.20.1.25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cognitive ecology of religion|Cognitive ecologists who study religion]] predict that god concepts across cultures can be linked to [[Coordination game|coordination solutions]] for local socioecological challenges, such as large-scale cooperation, intragroup cohesion and commitment, and resource management.&lt;ref name="botero"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in Religion, Cognitive Science and Experimental Philosophy|last=Purzycki|first=|last2=McNamara|publisher=|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=An Ecological Theory of Gods' Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an omniscient and morally punitive "Big God" may be adaptive for large-scale populations by motivating prosocial behavior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norenzayan|first1=Ara|last2=Shariff|first2=Azim F.|last3=Gervais|first3=Will M.|last4=Willard|first4=Aiyana K.|last5=McNamara|first5=Rita A.|last6=Slingerland|first6=Edward|last7=Henrich|first7=Joseph|title=The cultural evolution of prosocial religions|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2 December 2014|volume=39|doi=10.1017/S0140525X14001356}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas gods associated with small-scale societies are often concerned about the stability of local resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Purzycki|first1=Benjamin Grant|title=The Evolution of Gods' Minds in the Tyva Republic|journal=Current Anthropology|date=13 April 2016|pages=S000–S000|doi=10.1086/685729|volume=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economic exchange ===
Social contracts and their associated fairness norms are thought by many economists to be contingent on means of production. A hunter-gatherer society, for instance, may operate at an equilibrium where each person contributes to the best of his or her ability and receives according to need. But if this society were to shift toward larger-scale agricultural practices, this equilibrium would be destabilized by increases in free riding and general temptations to profit by defecting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Binmore|first1=Ken|title=Economic man – or straw man?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=22 December 2005|volume=28|issue=06|doi=10.1017/S0140525X05230145}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been supported empirically in cross-cultural studies using [[Experimental economics|experimental economic]] game data, which showed a wide range of variance in fairness expectations between populations based on culturally-specific exchange concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henrich|first1=Boyd|author2=Bowles|author3=Camerer|author4=Fehr|author5=Gintis|author6=McElreath|author7=Aivard|author8=Barr|author9=Ensminger|author10=Henrich|author11=Hill|author12=Gil-White|author13=Gurven|author14=Marlowe|author15=Patton|author16=Tracer|title="Economic man" in cross-cultural perspective: Behavioral experiments in 15 small-scale societies|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|date=2005|volume=28|doi=10.1017/s0140525x05000142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gachter|first1=S.|last2=Herrmann|first2=B.|last3=Thoni|first3=C.|title=Culture and cooperation|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=2 August 2010|volume=365|issue=1553|pages=2651–2661|doi=10.1098/rstb.2010.0135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This shift in fairness expectations has also been implicated in archaeological data. In particular, the relaxed sharing norms hypothesized to be built upon periods of successful maize exploitation in the pre-Hispanic Pueblo Southwest seemed to be eroded by decreases in agricultural success. In other words, when crops began to fail and supply became low, cultural exchange norms became more stringent, kin-based and based on [[Reciprocal altruism|reciprocity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bocinsky|first1=R. K.|last2=Rush|first2=J.|last3=Kintigh|first3=K. W.|last4=Kohler|first4=T.

Established in 1988, the '''Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes''' serves as a site for the discussion of issues germane to the fostering of [[Crossdisciplinarity|crossdisciplinary activity]] and as a network for the circulation of information and the sharing of resources within the [[humanities]] and [[Interpretive sociology|interpretive social sciences]]. CHCI has a membership of over 200 centers and institutes that are remarkably diverse in size and scope and are located in the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Korea]], [[Finland]], [[Taiwan]], [[Ireland]], [[United Kingdom]], and other countries.

==Mission and History==
Established in 1988, the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes (CHCI) serves as an arena for the discussion of issues germane to crossdisciplinary activity in the humanities and as a network for the circulation of information and [[best practice]]s related to the organizational and management dimensions of humanities centers and institutes. CHCI produces a major Annual Meeting of its membership, maintains a content-rich [[website]], produces an annual print directory, and serves as a re-circulator for information about its members via [[LISTSERV|listservs]] and its website. Members of the Consortium also assist one another with ideas, evaluation, and other forms of service. The organization is headed by a President, and is governed by an International Advisory Board of member directors and other leaders in the humanities.

CHCI was established in 1988 as the product of two meetings: ''The Institutional Impact of Institutes'' at the [[University of California Humanities Research Institute]] (UCHRI, now based at the [[University of California, Irvine]]), convened by [[Murray Krieger]], and an organizational meeting at the 1988 meeting of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (ACLS), convened by E. Ann Kaplan of the Humanities Institute at [[Stony Brook University]]. These gatherings were the first moments at which directors of humanities research organizations had come together to discuss issues of mutual concern, and the major product of the meetings was a unanimous sense that it was essential to establish a [[consortium]] to continue these dialogues. Ralph Cohen of the [[University of Virginia]] served from 1988-1995 as the organization's first Chair, while CHCI administration was based at UCHRI. In its early years, the CHCI membership included over 70 members from the US and four other countries.

In 1995 CHCI operations and leadership moved to the Center for 21st Century Studies at the [[University of Wisconsin&amp;ndash;Milwaukee]], at that time directed by Kathleen Woodward, currently Director of [[The Walter Chapin Simpson Center for the Humanities]] at the [[University of Washington]]. During CHCI's term at UW-Milwaukee, the membership grew to over 125 organizations as new centers were opened and existing members began to expand their programs and operations. This period of time also saw the dramatic expansion of CHCI's Annual Meetings, the development of the organization's first [[website]], and two major [[Grant (money)|grants]] from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] for [[organizational development]] and network-building.

In 2001 CHCI moved to the auspices of the Humanities Center at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], where Director [[Marjorie Garber]] served a six-year term as President of CHCI. During Professor Garber's term, membership continued to grow, and CHCI's annual meetings grew markedly in terms of depth, scale and impact.

In 2007, CHCI operations moved to the [[John Hope Franklin Humanities Institute]] at [[Duke University]], under the leadership of ex-CHCI President [[Srinivas Aravamudan]]. At Duke, CHCI began developing new programs for membership, such as a partnership with the American Council of Learned Societies.

In 2016, CHCI moved from Duke University to the Center for the Humanities at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin-Madison]], where Professor Sara Guyer took over as president. In December of the same year, [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation|The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] announced their decision to fund two new CHCI initiatives: [https://chcinetwork.org/programs/global-humanities-institutes The CHCI Global Humanities Institutes] and [https://chcinetwork.org/programs/africa-humanities-workshops The CHCI Africa Initiative].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chcinetwork.org/news/mellon-foundation-fund-two-new-chci-initiatives|title=Mellon Foundation to Fund Two New CHCI Initiatives {{!}} Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes|website=chcinetwork.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 5, 2018 it was announced that CHCI would serve as a host organization for the [[American Council of Learned Societies|American Council of Learned Societies's]] Public Fellows program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chcinetwork.org/news/chci-selected-as-host-organization-for-american-council-of-learned-societys-public-fellows-program|title=CHCI Selected as Host Organization for American Council of Learned Society's Public Fellows Program {{!}} Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes|website=chcinetwork.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CHCI is an [[affiliated institution|affiliate]] member of the American Council of Learned Societies. The organization has put out statements affirming its support of federal funding for the humanities in general and for the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chcinetwork.org/news/take-action-statement-on-proposed-arts-and-humanities-cuts-in-the-us|title=Take Action: Statement on Proposed Arts and Humanities Cuts in the US {{!}} Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes|website=chcinetwork.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual Meetings==
CHCI's Annual Meetings provide an opportunity for member directors and administrators to engage in stimulating intellectual dialogues about broadly defined, current issues in the humanities. Each Annual Meeting includes useful and lively workshops focused on [[management]] issues, programming ideas and structures, [[fundraising]], facilities, [[Human resources|staffing]], and other operational challenges facing member directors and their staffs. Perhaps most importantly, each CHCI Annual Meeting provides invaluable opportunities to meet, network, and collaborate with peers and counterparts at humanities centers and institutes from around the world. Each CHCI Annual Meeting is each constructed around a broadly defined intellectual theme, and is hosted by a member center or institute. Upcoming and recent Annual Meetings include:

Kant defined the relationship between ontotheology and cosmostheology as follows: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Transcendental theology aims either at inferring the existence of a Supreme Being from a general experience, without any closer reference to the world to which this experience belongs, and in this case it is called cosmotheology; or it endeavours to cognize the existence of such a being, through mere conceptions, without the aid of experience, and is then termed ontotheology."&lt;ref&gt;Kant, Immanuel, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', [https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;q=%22Transcendental+theology+aims+either+at+inferring+the+existence+of+a+Supreme+Being+from+a+general+experience,+without+any+closer+reference+to+the+world+to+which+this+experience+belongs,+and+in+this+case%22%22it+is+called+cosmotheology;+or+it+endeavours+to+cognize+the+existence+of+such+a+being,+through+mere+conceptions,+without+the+aid+of+experience,+and+is+then+termed+Ontotheology%22 Section VII: Critique of all Theology based upon Speculative Principles of Reason].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Clear jelly dildo series.png|thumb|A {{convert|5.5|in|cm|adj=on}} clear jelly dildo]]
A '''dildo''' is a [[sex toy]], often explicitly [[Phallus|phallic]] in appearance, intended for [[sexual penetration]] or other [[sexual activity]] during [[masturbation]] or with [[sex partner]]s.

==Description and uses==
===General===
A dildo is a device usually designed for penetration of the [[vagina]], mouth, or [[Human anus|anus]], and is usually solid and phallic in shape. Some expand this definition to include [[vibrator (sex toy)|vibrators]]. Others exclude penis [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] aids, which are known as "extensions". Some include penis-shaped items clearly designed with [[Sexual intercourse|vaginal penetration]] in mind, even if they are not true approximations of a penis. Some people include devices designed for [[anal penetration]] ([[butt plug]]s), while others do not. These devices are often used by people of all genders and [[sexual orientation]]s, for masturbation or for other sexual activity.

===Materials===
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}
[[File:Wood dildo.jpg|thumb|Mahogany wood dildo]]
Rubber dildos, usually incorporating a steel spring for stiffness, became available in the 1940s. This arrangement was unsatisfactory because of the potential for injury from cuts by the spring if the rubber cracked and came apart. Later, [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] dildos with a softer PVC filler became popular. Most of the inexpensive dildos sold in the 2000s are made this way.

PVC and jelly-rubber toys are problematic because they contain unsafe [[phthalate]]s, softeners added to many plastics that are also found in some jewelry, food containers, and other soft rubber toys. Phthalates are linked to health problems such as cancer and prenatal defects. Products made of PVC or jelly rubber cannot be [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]]. Manufacturers recommend using [[condom]]s with these toys if users share them.

High-end, [[Chrome plating|chrome plated]] [[steel]] dildos are also popular in the [[BDSM]] scene. Some users prefer them because of their [[hardness]], firmness, durability, electrical conductance (see [[erotic electrostimulation]]), and low friction, especially when used in conjunction with lubricant. Because they are heavy, they can be used to exercise vaginal [[Pubococcygeus muscle|PC muscles]].

A steel dildo may be warmed or cooled in water before use to elicit a range of temperature sensations. It may also retain the user's body heat. Its polished nonporous surface allows sterilization in boiling water or an [[autoclave]].

[[Glass]] and steel dildos have similar features. In most cases, glass toys are solid, and made of [[Pyrex]] or other types [[borosilicate]] glass (Schott-Duranglas and Simax), although their construction can vary depending on the manufacturer. Like steel, glass toys may be used to apply firmer pressure than silicone can to a female's [[G-spot]] ([[urethral sponge]]) or a male's [[prostate gland]]. Unlike other types of toys, glass sex toys can also be personalized with inscriptions.

Cyberskin is a synthetic material that feels more like human skin. It is a porous material and cannot be sterilized. It often decomes sticky after washing (which can be remedied by a dusting of [[cornstarch]]) and is more delicate and more prone to rips and tears than silicone dildos. "[[Packing (phallus)|Packing]] dildos", which are not designed for penetration, are often made of this material.

Phallus-shaped vegetables and fruits, such as [[banana]]s or [[zucchini]] have even been used as dildos. Any object of sufficient firmness and shape could be used as a dildo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yourtango.com/2015278445/11-things-you-should-never-ever-put-inside-your-vagina|title=11 Things You Should Never, EVER Put Inside Your Vagina|date=10 August 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shape===
[[File:Dildo PICT3774 small.jpg|thumb|180px|Acrylic dildo]]
Conventionally, many dildos are shaped like a [[human penis]] with varying degrees of detail; others are made to resemble the phallus of animals. Not all, however, are fashioned to reproduce the male anatomy meticulously, and dildos come in a wide variety of shapes. They may resemble figures, or simply be practical creations which stimulate more easily than conventional designs. In [[Japan]], many dildos are created to resemble animals or cartoon characters, such as [[Hello Kitty]], so that they may be sold as conventional toys, thus avoiding [[obscenity|obscenity laws]]. Some dildos have textured surfaces to enhance sexual pleasure, and others have [[macrophallic]] dimensions including over a dozen inches long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kendall|first1=Christopher|title=Gay male pornography: an issue of sex discrimination|date=2001|page=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uses===

{{redirect|Anal dildo|the vibrating device intended to remain in place for some time|anal vibrator}}
Most dildos are intended for [[Sexual penetration|vaginal or anal penetration]] and stimulation, whether for [[masturbation]] or with a [[sexual partner]]. Dildos have [[Sexual fetishism|fetishistic]] value as well, and may be used in other ways, such as touching one's own or another's skin in various places, often during [[foreplay]] or as an act of [[dominance and submission]]. If of appropriate sizes, they can be used as [[Gag (BDSM)|gags]], for oral penetration for a sort of artificial [[fellatio]]. Dildos, particularly specially designed ones, may be used to stimulate the [[G-spot]] area.

A dildo designed for anal insertion and to remain in place is usually referred to as a butt plug. A dildo intended for repeated anal penetration (thrusting) is typically referred to as an '''anal dildo''' or simply "dildo". Anal dildos and butt plugs generally have a large base to avoid accidental complete insertion into the rectum, which may require medical removal. Some women use [[double penetration dildo|double-ended dildos]], with different-sized shafts pointing in the same direction, for simultaneous vaginal and anal penetration, or for two partners to share a single dildo. In the latter case, the dildo acts as a sort of "see-saw," where each partner takes an end and receives stimulation.

Some dildos are designed to be worn in a harness, sometimes called a [[strap-on dildo|strap-on]] harness or [[strap-on dildo]], or to be worn inside, sometimes with externally-attached [[vibrating]] devices. Strap-on dildos may be double-ended, meant to be worn by users who want to experience vaginal or anal penetration while also penetrating a partner. They may also be used for anally penetrating men. If a female penetrates a male, the act is known as ''[[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]]''.

Other types of dildos include those designed to be fitted to the face of one party, inflatable dildos, and dildos with suction cups attached to the base (sometimes referred to as a wall mount). Other types of harness mounts for dildos (besides strapping to the groin) include thigh mount, face mount, or furniture mounting straps.

Recent social acceptance and popularity has resulted in the emergence of highly adorned dildos, which are often made of expensive materials and may be [[jewellery|jewelled]].

==Society and culture==

===Etymology===
The etymology of the word ''dildo'' is unclear. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (''OED'') describes the word as being of "origin unknown".&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{Cite book|contribution=dildo|contribution-url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/dildo|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED Online]]|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1989|accessdate=21 April 2009|postscript=.}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One theory is that it originally referred to the phallus-shaped peg used to lock an [[oar]] in position on a [[dory]] (small boat). It would be inserted into a hole on the side of the boat, and is very similar in shape to the modern toy. The sex toy might take its name from this sailing tool, which also lends its name to the town of [[Dildo, Newfoundland and Labrador|Dildo]] and the nearby [[Dildo Island]] in [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], [[Canada]]. Others suggest the word is a [[Corruption (linguistics)|corruption]] of [[Italian language|Italian]] ''diletto'' "delight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=dildo&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''OED'', the word's first appearance in English was in [[Thomas Nashe]]'s ''[[The Choice of Valentines]]'' ''or the Merie Ballad of Nash his Dildo'' (c. 1593).&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The ''OED'' notes that in the 1899 edition of Nashe's ''Choise of Valentines'' the following sentence appears: "Curse [[eunuch|Eunuke]] dilldo, senceless counterfet."&lt;/ref&gt; The word also appears in [[Ben Jonson]]'s 1610 play, ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]''. [[William Shakespeare]] used the term once in ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'', believed to be from 1610 or 1611, but not printed until the [[First Folio]] of 1623.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The ''OED'' cites Jonson's 1610 edition of ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' ("Here I find ... The seeling fill'd with poesies of the candle: And Madame, with a Dildo, writ o' the walls.": Act V, scene iii) and Shakespeare's ''The Winter's Tale'' (dated 1611) ("He has the prettiest Loue-songs for Maids ... with such delicate burthens of Dildo's and Fadings.": Act IV, scene iv).&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "Dil Doul", referring to a man's penis, appears in the 17th century [[folk music|folk ballad]] "The Maids Complaint for want of a Dil Doul".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/21716/citation|title=
The Maids Complaint / For want of a Dil doul|quote=The Maids Complaint / For want of a Dil doul. / This Girl long time had in a sickness been, / Which many maids do call the sickness green: / I wish she may some comfort find poor Soul / And have her belly fill'd with a Dil doul.|work=[[Samuel Pepys]] Library|publisher=Magdalene College}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was among the many in the library of [[Samuel Pepys]].

An ''olisbos'' (pl. ''olisboi'') is a classical term for a dildo, from Greek {{lang|el|ὄλισβος}}.&lt;ref name=LSJolisbos&gt;{{LSJ|o)/lisbos|ὄλισβος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. a dildo that was usually made of leather. A ''[[wikt:godemiché|godemiché]]'' is a dildo in the shape of a penis with scrotum.

In some modern languages, the names for ''dildo'' can be more descriptive, creative or subtle—note, for instance, the [[Russian language|Russian]] ''фаллоимитатор'' (literally "phallic imitator"), [[Hindi]] {{lang|hi|दर्शिल्दो}} ''{{IAST|darśildō}}'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''consolador'' "consoler" and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''cala goeg'' "fake penis".

===History===
Dildos in one form or another have been present in society throughout history. [[Artifact (archaeology)|Artifacts]] from the [[Upper Paleolithic]] of a type called [[bâton de commandement]] have been speculated to have been used for sexual purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Marshack, A. 1972 The Roots of Civilization ''McGraw-Hill New York:'' 333&lt;/ref&gt;  Few archaeologists consider these items as sex toys, but archaeologist [[Timothy Taylor (archaeologist)|Timothy Taylor]] put it, "Looking at the size, shape, and—some cases—explicit symbolism of the ice age batons, it seems disingenuous to avoid the most obvious and straightforward interpretation. But it has been avoided."&lt;ref name='taylor_prehistory'&gt;Taylor, T. 1996. ''The Prehistory of Sex.'' New York: Bantam.  p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='macaques'&gt;Paul L. Vasey, ''Intimate Sexual Relations in Prehistory: Lessons from the Japanese Macaques.''  World Archaeology, Vol. 29, No. 3, Intimate Relations (Feb., 1998), pp. 407-425&lt;/ref&gt;

The first dildos were made of stone, tar, wood and other materials that could be shaped as penises and that were firm enough to be used as penetrative sex toys. Scientists believe that a 20-centimeter siltstone [[phallus]] from the Upper Palaeolithic period 30,000 years ago, found in [[Hohle Fels]] Cave near Ulm, [[Germany]], may have been used as a dildo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4713323.stm | work=BBC News | title=Ancient phallus unearthed in cave | date=2005-07-25 | accessdate=2010-05-01 | first=Jonathan | last=Amos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dildo-like [[breadstick]]s, known as ''olisbokollikes'' (sing. ''olisbokollix''),&lt;ref name=LSJolisbokollix&gt;{{LSJ|o)lisboko/llic|ὀλισβοκόλλιξ|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; were known in Ancient Greece prior to the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Belardes|first=Nick|title=Random obsessions : trivia you can't live without|year=2009|publisher=Viva Editions|location=San Francisco|isbn=1573443603|page=97|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AW_g7e0QXBkC&amp;pg=PT111&amp;lpg=PT111&amp;dq=olisbo-kollix&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kTOQmGqqw2&amp;sig=KtxOKf_if4jHF-I2jn9wxQVHAjc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_CQLUf-fOcSL0QGpo4D4Cg&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[China|Chinese]] women in the 15th century used dildos made of lacquered wood with textured surfaces. Nashe's early-1590s work ''The Choice of Valentines'' mentions a dildo made from glass.&lt;ref name="Haynes"&gt;{{cite book | title=Sex in Elizabethan England | publisher=Sutton Publishing | author=Haynes, Alan | year=1997 | pages=140 | isbn=0750910712}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many references to dildos exist in the [[history|historical]] and [[ethnography|ethnographic]] literature. Haberlandt,&lt;ref&gt;Haberlandt, M. 1899. "Conträre Sexual-Erscheinungen bei der Neger-Bevölkerung Zanzibars", ''Zeitschrift für Ethnologie'', 31: 668–670&lt;/ref&gt; for example, illustrates single and [[double penetration dildo|double-ended wooden dildos]] from late 19th century [[Zanzibar]]. With the invention of modern materials, making dildos of different shapes, sizes, colors and textures became more practical. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestdildo.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Interesting-Facts-about-your-Favorite-Sex-Toys.pdf|title=More Historical Facts on Sex Toys|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ancient Greece====

[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (27).jpg|thumb|Dildo being used by two women. Lithograph from ''[[De Figuris Veneris]]'' (1906) by [[Édouard-Henri Avril]]]]
Dildos may be seen in some examples of [[Pottery of ancient Greece|ancient Greek vase art]]. Some pieces show their use in group sex or in solitary female masturbation.&lt;ref name="duBois 2003 85"&gt;{{cite book | title= Slaves and other objects | last=  duBois | first= Paige | year= 2003 | publisher= University of Chicago Press| isbn= 0-226-16787-9 |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One vessel, of about the 6th century BC, depicts a scene in which a woman bends over to perform [[oral sex]] on a man, while another man is about to thrust a dildo into her [[anal sex|anus]].&lt;ref&gt;

They are mentioned several times in [[Aristophanes]]' comedy of 411 BC, ''[[Lysistrata]]''.

:LYSISTRATA
:''And so, girls, when fucking time comes… not the faintest whiff of it anywhere, right? From the time those Milesians betrayed us, we can’t even find our eight-fingered leather dildos. At least they’d serve as a sort of flesh-replacement for our poor cunts…  So, then! Would you like me to find some mechanism by which we could end this war?'' &lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herodas]]' short comic play, ''[[Herodas#Mime VI|Mime VI]]'', written in the 3rd Century BC, is about a woman called Metro, anxious to discover from a friend where she recently acquired a dildo.

:METRO
:''I beg you, don't lie,''
:''dear Corrioto: who was the man who stitched for you this bright red dildo?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Sexuality in Greek and Roman society and literature | last1=  Johnson | first1= Marguerite | last2=Ryan | first2=Terry | year= 2005 | publisher= Routledge| isbn= 0-674-01379-4 |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She eventually discovers the maker to be a man called Kerdon, who hides his trade by the front of being a cobbler, and leaves to seek him out. Metro and Kerdon are main characters in the next play in the sequence, ''Mime VII'', when she visits his shop.

Page duBois, a classicist and feminist theorist, suggests that dildos were present in Greek art because the ancient Greek male imagination found it difficult to conceive of sex taking place without penetration. Therefore, female masturbation or sex between women required an artificial phallus to be used.&lt;ref name="duBois 2003 85"/&gt;

====Early modern period====
In the early 1590s, the English playwright [[Thomas Nashe]] wrote a poem known as ''[[The Choice of Valentines]]'', ''Nashe's Dildo'' or ''The Merrie Ballad of Nashe his Dildo''. This was not printed at the time, due to its obscenity&lt;ref name="coulthart"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.johncoulthart.com/feuilleton/2011/02/14/the-choise-of-valentines-or-the-merie-ballad-of-nash-his-dildo/ | title=The Choise of Valentines, Or the Merie Ballad of Nash His Dildo | publisher=www.johncoulthart.com | date=Feb 14, 2011 | accessdate=July 10, 2011 | author=Coulthart, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was still widely circulated and made Nashe's name notorious.&lt;ref name="Haynes" /&gt; The poem describes a visit to a brothel by a man called "Tomalin"; he is searching for his sweetheart, Francis, who has become a prostitute. The only way he can see her is to hire her. However, she resorts to using a glass dildo as he finds himself unable to perform sexually to her satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Madams - Bawds &amp; Brothel-Keepers of London | publisher=The History Press Ltd | author=Linnane, Fergus | year=2005 | pages=16 | isbn=0-7509-3306-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dildos are humorously mentioned in Act IV, scene iv of Shakespeare's ''[[The Winter's Tale]]''. This play and [[Ben Jonson]]'s play ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'' (1610) are typically cited as the first use of the word in publication (Nashe's ''Merrie Ballad'' was not published until 1899&lt;ref name="coulthart" /&gt;).

[[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester|John Wilmot]], the 17th century English [[libertine]], published his poem '' Signor Dildo'' in 1673. During the Parliamentary session of that year, objections were raised to the proposed marriage of [[James II of England|James, Duke of York]], brother of the King and heir to the throne, to [[Mary of Modena]], an Italian Catholic princess. An address was presented to [[Charles II of England|King Charles]] on 3 November, foreseeing the dangerous consequences of marriage to a Catholic, and urging him to put a stop to any planned wedding '...to the unspeakable Joy and Comfort of all Your loyal Subjects." Wilmot's response was ''[http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/dildo.html Signior Dildo (You ladies all of merry England)]'', a mock address anticipating the 'solid' advantages of a Catholic marriage, namely the wholesale importation of Italian dildos, to the unspeakable joy and comfort of all the ladies of England:

:''You ladies all of merry England''
:''Who have been to kiss the Duchess's hand,''
:''Pray, did you not lately observe in the show''
:''A noble Italian called Signor Dildo? ...''

:''A rabble of pricks who were welcomed before'',
:''Now finding the porter denied them the door,''
:''Maliciously waited his coming below''
:''And inhumanly fell on Signor Dildo ...''

This ballad was subsequently added to by other authors, and became so popular that ''Signor'' became a term for a dildo.&lt;ref name="wilson" /&gt; In the epilogue to ''[[The Mistaken Husband]]'' (1674), by [[John Dryden]], an actress complains:

:''To act with young boys is loving without men.''
:''What will not poor forsaken women try?''
:''When man's not near, the Signior must supply.''&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;{{cite book | title= Court satires of the Restorationd | last=  Wilson | first= John | year= 1976 | publisher=  Ohio State University Press| isbn= 978-0-8142-0249-4 |page=14|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0dXpt-fAcJMC&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'' Signor Dildo'' was more recently set to music by [[Michael Nyman]] for the Wilmot [[biopic]], ''[[The Libertine (2004 film)|The Libertine.]]''

Many other works of bawdy and satirical English literature of the period deal with the subject. ''Dildoides: A Burlesque Poem'' (London, 1706), attributed to [[Samuel Butler (poet)|Samuel Butler]], is a mock lament to a collection of dildos that had been seized and publicly burnt by the authorities. Examples of anonymous works include ''The Bauble, a tale'' (London, 1721) and ''Monsieur Thing's Origin: or Seignor D---o's Adventures in London,'' (London, 1722).&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1987), p.53&lt;/ref&gt; In 1746, [[Henry Fielding]] wrote ''The Female Husband: or the surprising history of Mrs Mary, alias Mr. George Hamilton'', in which a woman posing as a man uses a dildo. This was a fictionalized account of the story of [[Mary Hamilton (bigamist)|Mary Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;Wagner (1987), p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

====20th century====
Dildos are obliquely referred to in [[Saul Bellow]]'s novel ''[[The Adventures of Augie March]]'' (1953): "....he had brought me along to a bachelor's stag where two naked acrobatic girls did stunts with false tools".&lt;ref&gt;Bellow, Saul The Adventures of Augie March  New York: Penguin, 1953, 2001 . p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; A dildo called ''Steely Dan III from Yokohama'' appears in the [[William S. Burroughs]] novel ''[[The Naked Lunch]]'' (1959).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.steelydan.com/mojo.html|title= The Return of Steely Dan|accessdate=December 15, 2006|work= [[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo Magazine]]|date=October 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.steelydan.com/faq.html|title= Official Steely Dan FAQ|accessdate=January 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rock band [[Steely Dan]] took their name from it.

===21st century===
In 2017, [[dark web]] privacy researcher [[Sarah Jamie Lewis]] connected a vibrator (using [[reverse engineering]]) to [[Tor anonymity network|Tor]], the anonymity network, in a [[proof of concept]] demonstrating the applicability of privacy technology after the fact.&lt;ref name="We Anonymously Controlled a Dildo Through the Tor Network"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/wjnwgb/we-anonymously-controlled-a-dildo-through-the-tor-network |title=We Anonymously Controlled a Dildo Through the Tor Network |last=Cox |first=Joseph |date=2017-08-07 |website=Motherboard |access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal and ethical issues ===
The possession and sale of dildos is illegal in some jurisdictions, including [[India]].&lt;ref name="palika"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-11-26/delhi/27813379_1_toys-palika-bazaar-electronic-goods|title=Palika a haven for adult toys|last=Sethi|first=Atul|date=2008-11-26|work=[[Times of India]]|publisher=[[Times Group]]|accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until recently, many [[Southern United States|southern states]] and some [[Great Plains]] states in the United States banned the sale of dildos completely, either directly or through laws regulating "obscene devices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Lingere Store Accused of Violating State Obscenity Laws | publisher = KBCD.com | url = http://www.kcbd.com/Global/story.asp?S=6554592&amp;pass=1&amp;nav=3w6y | accessdate = 2007-09-28 | archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/5vyu8WWwd?url=http://www.kcbd.com/Global/story.asp?S=6554592&amp;pass=1&amp;nav=3w6y | archive-date = 2011-01-24 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a federal appeals court upheld Alabama's law prohibiting the sale of sex toys.&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, Phillip.

In February 2008, a federal appeals court overturned a [[Texas]] statute banning the sales of dildos and other sexual toys, deeming such a statute as violating the Constitution's 14th Amendment on the right to privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Appeals court overturns Texas ban on sex toys | publisher = msnbc.msn.com | url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23155562 | accessdate = 2008-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appeals court cited ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'', where the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 2003 struck down bans on consensual sex between gay couples, as unconstitutionally aiming at "enforcing a public moral code by restricting private intimate conduct." Similar statutes have been struck down in [[Kansas]] and [[Colorado]]. Alabama is the only state where a law prohibiting the sale of sex toys remains on the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/alcode/13A/12/4/5/13A-12-200.2|title=Alabama Code Title 13A.

Some [[Conservatism|Conservative]] [[Christian]]s believe that the use of sex toys is immoral. The [[Southern Baptist Convention|Southern Baptist]] preacher Dan Ireland has been an outspoken critic of such devices and has fought to ban them on religious and ethical grounds.&lt;ref name="huffpo2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jacob-m-appel/alabamas-bad-vibrations_b_300491.html|title=Alabama's Bad Vibrations|work=Huffington Post|date=17 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ireland led an effort to outlaw dildos and other sex toys in Alabama to "...protect the public against themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=editorial board|title=State should scrap pointless law|url=http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/news/20080123/state-should-scrap-pointless-law|accessdate=28 March 2018|work=Tuscaloosa News|date=23 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Christian religious leaders such as [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of America]] pastor Heidi Johnson, who founded a student group on sexuality at [[Duke Divinity School]], have a positive view of sex toys in Christian sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elle.com/life-love/sex-relationships/a46666/how-the-pussy-pastor-is-bringing-sex-and-christianity-together/|title=Pussy Pastor Heidi Johnson Joins Sex and Christianity|last=Weiss|first=Suzannah|date=19 June 2017|work=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|publisher=[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]|language=English|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erotic electrostimulation''' (abbreviated '''e-stim'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2009/nov/17/erotic-electricity/ |title=Erotic electricity |publisher=Las Vegas Weekly |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also known as '''electrosex''') is a [[human sexual practice|sexual practice]] involving the application of [[electricity|electrical]] stimulation to the [[nerve]]s of the body, with particular emphasis on the [[genitals]], using a power source (such as a [[TENS]], [[Electrical muscle stimulation|EMS]], [[Violet wand]], or made-for-play units) for purposes of [[sexual stimulation]]. Electrostimulation has been associated with [[BDSM]] activities, and erotic electrostimulation is an evolution of that practice.

== Safety ==
Electrostimulation, in general, can cause [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] damage or even [[death]] if misused.&lt;ref name="Juice"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Abdul |first= Uncle |title= Juice: Electricity for Pleasure and Pain |year= 1998 |publisher= Greenery Press |location=San Francisco |isbn= 1-890159-06-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common problems arising from electrostimulation tend to be [[burn]]s from lack of sufficiently wide surface contact, i.e. [[electric insulation|bad contact]], between the electrode and the skin's surface.&lt;ref name="zity.biz"&gt;http://www.zity.biz/docs/english/estim/information/guide-to-erotic-electrostimulation.html&lt;/ref&gt; Even at relatively low [[Electric current|current]] and [[voltage]], there is also risk of interference with normal heart function (potentially including [[cardiac arrest]]), and this risk is higher for those who use an [[artificial pacemaker]] or similar device or who have heart conditions.&lt;ref name="zity.biz"/&gt; Because of this, it is not advisable to place the electrical contacts in such a way that current passes through the [[thoracic cavity|chest cavity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merckmanuals.com/home/fundamentals/rehabilitation/treatment_of_pain_and_inflammation.html |title=Treatment of Pain and Inflammation: Rehabilitation: Merck Manual Home Edition |publisher=Merckmanuals.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international standard on the basic safety of medical nerve and muscle stimulators advises “that stimulation should not be applied across or through the head, directly on the eyes, covering the mouth, on the front of the neck, (especially the [[carotid sinus]]), or from electrodes placed on the chest and the upper back or crossing over the heart”.&lt;ref name="iec601-2-10"&gt;{{cite|title=IEC 60601-2-10:2012 – Medical electrical equipment – Part 2-10: Particular requirements for the basic safety and essential performance of nerve and muscle stimulators|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/2617}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard also notes that “any electrodes that have current densities exceeding 2 mA/cm² may require the special attention of the operator”. It imposes the following limits on the output parameters of stimulators (for therapeutic purposes):

* with a load resistance of 500 Ω, the output current shall not exceed
**80 mA at DC
**50 mA below 400 Hz pulse frequency
**80 mA at 400–1500 Hz
**100 mA above 1500 Hz
* for pulse durations less than 0.1 s, the pulse energy into a 500 Ω load shall not exceed 300 mJ per pulse, for longer pulses the above DC limit applies
* the output shall not exceed a peak voltage of 500 V when measured under open-circuit condition

Erotic electrostimulation devices should avoid DC currents entirely, in order to avoid [[Electrolysis|electrolytic]] effects. This is usually achieved through “biphasic” waveforms, each positive current [[Pulse (signal processing)|pulse]] is followed an equivalent negative current pulse. Devices with multiple channels (e.g. for several users or body regions) should have a small pulse [[isolation transformer]] for [[galvanic isolation]] in each channel, such that currents cannot flow across the body between channels. Pulse frequency, duration and amplitude should be selected to achieve the desired stimulation with the least amount of power delivered into the body, for example avoiding current during the [[Refractory period (physiology)|refractory period]] after each [[action potential]], where neurons do not respond to stimuli. Typical erotic electrostimulation devices use pulse frequencies in the range 300–3000 Hz, where skin nerves are most sensitive. 

A few cases of [[accidental death]] as a result of [[Autoeroticism|autoerotic]] electrostimulation have been reported in the [[forensic science]] literature; the cases reported involved [[Mains electricity|mains]]-powered, [[Do it yourself|self-made devices]], with current passing through the chest intentionally (usually via nipple stimulation) or unintentionally (for instance, touching an energized part with a hand).&lt;ref name="SauvageauGeberth2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anny Sauvageau|author2=Vernon J.

The tempered and evacuated glass tubes are back-filled with noble gas, causing them to emit sparks and glow with various colors when the violet wand is powered.]]
The use of electricity for entertainment purposes dates back at least as early as the 1740s. In the 1830s, insertable electrode attachments for small magnetos could be purchased. Later in the 1800s, various electric belts (some complete with "suspensory sack") were advertised as cures for impotence.&lt;ref name="Essig"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Essig |first= Mark |title= Edison &amp; The Electric Chair|page=43 |year= 2003 |isbn= 0-8027-1406-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the [[American Medical Association]] investigated such devices, and concluded that they provided "more or less mechanical masturbation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Body Electric: How Strange Machines Built the Modern American |last=de la Peña |first=Carolyn Thomas |year=2005 |publisher=NYU Press |location=New York |isbn=0-8147-1983-X |page=169 |accessdate=July 6, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MxU8Rf1pKTgC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;dq=electric+masturbation#v=onepage&amp;q=electric%20masturbation&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern{{Clarify|date=September 2010}} electrostimulation first became recognized during the 1950s with the introduction of a device called the ''[[Relax-A-Cizor]]'',{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} which was originally designed to stimulate the muscles of a [[Relaxation technique|relaxing]] subject using electric currents as a means of "passive [[exercise]]". Such power sources{{Dubious|date=September 2010}}&lt;!-- the Relax-A-Cizor was banned by the FDA--&gt; are still in medical use today and are known as EMS ([[electrical muscle stimulation]]) units. Some people soon found alternative uses for the Relax-A-Cizors by placing the contacts on sexual parts of the body.

By the 1970s, medical TENS ([[transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation]]) units were also being used for electrostimulation. In the 1980s the first devices manufactured specifically for erotic electrostimulation became available, in particular the Titillator and the Pleasure Box, later known as the PES Power Box.

In the 1970s, experimenters noticed that bare speaker wires could deliver a jolt and began using recorded and live sound for electrostimulation. At that time, there were no professionally made attachments for such play, so people built their own out of copper plumbing parts and other metal pieces with attention to [[resistor]]s placed in series with the human parts to control the current for safety. Although early e-stim units used only a simple, [[pulse wave|pulsed]], [[sinusoidal wave]], newer units use more complex [[wave form]]s and also allow for the use of ambient sound or prerecorded wave forms like music or specially designed computer files for specific types of stimulation. There are now sites dedicated to the creation of [[MP3]] files specifically for erotic journeys or symphonies, which can include such routines as rewards, punishments, very strong, and pleasantly soft portions.

== Types of power sources ==

=== Medical power sources ===

There are repackaged [[TENS]] and [[Electrical muscle stimulation|EMS]] units marketed as erotic electrostimulation power sources. EMS units are designed to cause muscle contraction.

=== Body toning and massage units ===
An increasing number of "body toner" or "electromassage"-type power sources are being marketed directly to consumers. Though lacking in options compared to the more expensive specialized units, these have proven to be an inexpensive method for entry level practice.

=== Homemade power sources ===
Some people craft "homemade" electrostimulation power sources, or adapt or modify commercial products (such as a [[High fidelity|Hifi]] or [[DVD]] system) that were never intended for electrostimulation of the human body. These can be dangerous practices; such improvised devices not specifically designed for use on the human body can easily cause injury.&lt;ref name="zity.biz"/&gt; The risk is mostly twofold. First the device can supply too much power. Second the insulation of most devices is not suited for medical equipment. For example, a transient over-voltage on the mains input can damage the isolation of the transformer, resulting in the output terminals becoming live.

=== Erotic electrostimulation power sources ===
Erotic electrostimulation power sources are specifically designed and manufactured for erotic use on the human body. The first [[Analogue electronics|analog]] devices became popular during the mid-1980s, and during the late 1990s [[Digital data|digital]] devices also became available. Both types usually allow for adjustments of frequency and power output levels, some with complex preset "programs" and computer controls. The setups usually consist of a "box" and electrodes connected by wiring. Many of the boxes are portable and can be powered by [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] or come with built-in [[rechargeable battery|rechargeable batteries]]. Some units can be connected to remote operators via an [[Internet]]-connected [[computer]] or controlled via [[radio]] frequency [[key fob]]s. Units which can be powered by a 9 volt battery are preferable to those plugged into mains as they reduce the risk of accidental injury.&lt;ref name="zity.biz"/&gt;

=== Other methods ===
There are other medical methods that have led to patent filings, such as the discovery that placing electrodes in the spinal cord can induce pleasurable feelings leading to orgasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference |number=6169924 |y=2001 |m=1 |d=2 |inventor=T. Stuart Meloy and W. Joseph Martin |title=Spinal cord stimulation}}. Retrieved 7 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also various apparatuses, with external or internal stimulation.

* [[United States patent law|U.S. patent]] 3,941,136: "Method for artificially inducing urination, defecation, or sexual excitation".&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference |number=3941136 |y=1976 |m=3 |d=2 |inventor=Louis Bucalo |title=Method for artificially inducing urination, defecation, or sexual excitation}}. Retrieved 7 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[United States patent law|U.S. patent]] 4,585,005: "Method and pacemaker for stimulating penile erection".&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent reference |number=4585005 |y=1986 |m=4 |d=29 |inventor=Tom P. Lue, Emil A. Tanagho, and Richard A. Schmidt |title=Method and pacemaker for stimulating penile erection}}. Retrieved 7 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other kinds of apparatus use [[Electroanalgesia#Interferential_current_therapy|interferential currents]] with four surface electrodes to replace the internal electrodes.

==Electrodes==
An [[electrode]] is used to deliver the actual electrostimulation to the body.

[[File:Electroplay girl with electrode.jpg|thumb|right|Example of woman with electrode on the chest. This is not recommended due to the risk of cardiac arrhythmia.&lt;ref name="zity.biz"/&gt;]]
The image of the woman receiving electrostimulation shows a deprecated practice. Placing electrodes anywhere on the chest is risking current passing through the heart, which risks cardiac arrhythmia or arrest. The general rule for electrostimulation is 'only below the waist'.&lt;ref name="zity.biz"/&gt;

For erotic electrostimulation, these are typically items designed to be applied to the genitals such as vaginal plugs and shields, [[butt plug|anal plug]]s, probes to directly stimulate the prostate, testicle rings, [[Cock and ball torture (sexual practice)|CBT boards]], [[cock ring]]s, urethral probes, and other items for [[human penis|penile]] application. The pads used with TENS units are also used in the sexual application of electrostimulation. There are also electrified [[nipple]] and [[breast]] electrodes available, but while there is disagreement within the e-stim community about their safety the most commonly held consensus is 'only below the waist'.&lt;ref name="zity.biz"/&gt; Still, the right-[[lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] of the body, the [[breast]], is far not as risky as the left one, due the proximity of the left breast to the [[heart]] and its [[nerve]]s, and so possibly colliding with the natural electro-impulse control of the [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]].

The electrodes can be made of [[metal]]s such as [[gold]], [[silver]], [[aluminum]], and [[stainless steel]]. There are also electrodes made out of [[conductive]] [[silicone]]. [[Conductive rubber]] is a cheap, flexible and efficient option.

==Violet wands==
[[File:Erotec-violet-wand.png|right|250px|thumb|Erotec Violet Wand, from 2000]]
'''Violet wands''' were originally electric and neon testers, but are now split into two types: mechanical (Tesla Coil), and solid-state wands.  They are used for the application of low current, high voltage (min 35&amp;nbsp;kV to max 65&amp;nbsp;kV typically), high-frequency electricity to the body, as such they are most commonly used in [[BDSM]] though erotic [[sensation play]].  Violet wands can deliver a variety of sharp, cutting, or piercing type sensations.

A violet wand typically consists of a hand-held "wand" made of plastic case which encases the mechanical (tesla coil) or solid state components; a power cable, a collet (7/16" in the United States, 11 mm in Europe), and a cone. The collet is inside the cone end of the Violet Wand and is where glass and metal probes are inserted to be used with the wand. The cone is there to prevent sparks jumping from the collet directly to subject. Violet wands can be used anywhere on the body but should not be used around the eyes.&lt;ref name="Juice"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Abdul |first= Uncle |title= Juice: Electricity for Pleasure and Pain |year= 1998 |publisher= Greenery Press |location=San Francisco |isbn= 1-890159-06-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lubrication ==
[http://www.bioshare.info/en/diygel Electroconductive gels] play an important role in the success of erotic electrostimulation since without it, there is a greater risk of high-current skin [[burn]]ing. Water-based lubricants are generally recommended. Typically it is recommended to avoid any lubricant that contains [[silicone]] since it is an [[Insulator (electrical)|insulator]] and hence reduces conductivity. Practitioners of electrostimulation select lubricants for compatibility with the material of the electrodes, as well as for desirable conductive properties, which can maximize the strength and quality of the signal.&lt;ref name="zity.biz"/&gt;

''Ethnoscape'' is one of five elementary frameworks ('''''ethnoscapes''''', ''[[mediascape]]s'', ''[[technoscape]]s'', ''[[financescape]]s'', and ''[[ideoscape]]s'') used by [[Arjun Appadurai]], in purpose of exploring fundamental discrepancies of global cultural flows. The suffix ''-scape'' indicates that these terms are perspectival constructs inflected by the historical, [[Linguistics|linguistic]], and political situatedness of different kinds of actors: nation-states, multinationals, diasporic communities, and subnational groupings and movements, whether religious, political, or economic, etc..

By using the ethnoscape, Appadurai extends the landscape of persons who form the shifting world where we live, that is, tourists, [[Immigration|immigrants]], refugees, or any moving groups and individuals of fundamental feature of the world and appear to affect the politics of (and between) nations to a hitherto unprecedented degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frank J. and Boli|first1=Frank J. and John|title=The Globalization Reader|date=2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.|page=98|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Appadurai|first1=Arjun|title=Disjuncture and Difference in the Global Cultural Economy|journal=Modernity at Large: Cultural Dimensions of Globalization|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appadurai claims that this is not to say there are no relatively stable communities and networks of kinship, friendship, work, and leisure, as well as of birth, residence, and other filial forms. But it is to say that the warp of these stabilities is everywhere shot through with the weft of human motion, as more persons and groups deal with the realities of having to move of the fantasies of wanting to move. Ethnoscapes allow us to recognize that our notions of space, place and community have become much more complex, indeed a ‘single community’ may now be dispersed across a variety of sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smart|first1=B.|title=Postmodernity|date=1993|publisher=London: Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ESO Trailer.webm|thumb|Trailer of the European Southern Observatory]]

The '''European Southern Observatory''' ('''ESO'''), formally the '''European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eso.org/public/unitedkingdom/about-eso/organisation/ | title = ESO's Organisational Structure | accessdate = 2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;, is a 16-nation [[intergovernmental organization|intergovernmental research organization]] for ground-based [[astronomy]]. Created in 1962, ESO has provided astronomers with state-of-the-art research facilities and access to the southern sky. The organisation employs about 730 staff members and receives annual member state contributions of approximately €162&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/usa/about-eso/memberstates/ | title = Member States | date=2017-04-02 | accessdate = 2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its observatories are located in northern [[Chile]].

ESO has built and operated some of the largest and most technologically advanced [[telescope]]s. These include the 3.6 m [[New Technology Telescope]], an early pioneer in the use of [[active optics]], and the [[Very Large Telescope]] (VLT), which consists of four individual 8.2 m telescopes and four smaller auxiliary telescopes which can all work together or separately. The [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] observes the [[universe]] in the [[Terahertz radiation|millimetre and submillimetre]] wavelength ranges, and is the world's largest ground-based astronomy project to date. It was completed in March 2013 in an international collaboration by Europe (represented by ESO), North America, East Asia and Chile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almaobservatory.org/en | title = ALMA website | accessdate = 2011-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/alma/ | title = Welcome to ALMA! | accessdate = 2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently under construction is the [[Extremely Large Telescope]]. It will use a 39.3-metre-diameter [[segmented mirror]], and become the [[List of largest optical reflecting telescopes|world's largest]] optical reflecting telescope when operational in 2024. Its light-gathering power will allow detailed studies of planets around other stars, the first objects in the universe, [[supermassive black hole]]s, and the nature and distribution of the [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] which dominate the universe.

ESO's observing facilities have made astronomical discoveries and produced several [[astronomical catalogue]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.eso.org/starcat/astrocat/astrocat_screen_list.html | title = ESO Archive | accessdate = 2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its findings include the discovery of the most distant [[gamma-ray burst]] and evidence for a [[black hole]] at the centre of the [[Milky Way]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7268/full/nature08459.html | title = A gamma-ray burst at a redshift of 8.2| accessdate = 2011-09-21 | volume=461 | doi = 10.1038/nature08459 | journal=Nature | pages=1254–1257|arxiv = 0906.1577 |bibcode = 2009Natur.461.1254T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = Monitoring stellar orbits around the Massive Black Hole in the Galactic Center| date = 1970| last1 = Gillessen| first1 = S.| display-authors = 4| last2 = Eisenhauer| first2 = F.| last3 = Trippe| first3 = S.| last4 = Alexander| first4 = T.| last5 = Genzel| first5 = R.| last6 = Martins| first6 = F.| last7 = Ott| first7 = T.| doi = 10.1088/0004-637X/692/2/1075| journal = [[The Astrophysical Journal]]| volume = 692| issue = 2| pages = 1075|arxiv=0810.4674|bibcode = 2009ApJ...692.1075G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the VLT allowed astronomers to obtain the first picture of an [[extrasolar planet]] ([[2M1207b]]) orbiting a [[brown dwarf]] 173 light-years away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = A giant planet candidate near a young brown dwarf.

The idea that European astronomers should establish a common large observatory was broached by [[Walter Baade]] and [[Jan Oort]] at the [[Leiden Observatory]] in the Netherlands in spring 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ESO's Early History |author=Adriaan Blaauw |publisher=ESO |date=1991 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was pursued by Oort, who gathered a group of astronomers in Leiden to consider it on June 21 that year. Immediately thereafter, the subject was further discussed at the Groningen conference in the Netherlands. On January 26, 1954, an ESO declaration was signed by astronomers from six European countries expressing the wish that a joint European observatory be established in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref name="ESO Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/about-eso/timeline.html | title = ESO Timeline | accessdate = 2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, all [[reflector telescope]]s with an [[aperture]] of 2 metres or more were located in the northern hemisphere. The decision to build the observatory in the southern hemisphere resulted from the necessity of observing the southern sky; some research subjects (such as the central parts of the [[Milky Way]] and the [[Magellanic Clouds]]) were accessible only from the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Europe's Quest for the Universe |author=Lodewijk Woltjer |publisher=EDP Sciences |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was initially planned to set up telescopes in South Africa (where several European observatories were located), tests from 1955 to 1963 demonstrated that a site in the [[Andes]] was preferable. On November 15, 1963 [[Chile]] was chosen as the site for ESO's observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ESO's Early History |author=Adriaan Blaauw |publisher=ESO |date=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was preceded by the ESO Convention, signed 5 October 1962 by Belgium, Germany, France, the Netherlands and Sweden. [[Otto Heckmann]] was nominated as the organisation's first director general on 1 November 1962.

A preliminary proposal for a convention of astronomy organisations in these five countries was drafted in 1954. Although some amendments were made in the initial document, the convention proceeded slowly until 1960 when it was discussed during that year's committee meeting. The new draft was examined in detail, and a council member of [[CERN]] (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) highlighted the need for a convention between governments (in addition to organisations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ESO's Early History |author=Adriaan Blaauw |publisher=ESO |date=1991 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention and government involvement became pressing due to rapidly rising costs of site-testing expeditions. The final 1962 version was largely adopted from the CERN convention, due to similarities between the organisations and the dual membership of some members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ESO's Early History |author=Adriaan Blaauw |publisher=ESO |date=1991 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the first ESO telescope at the La Silla site in Chile began operating.&lt;ref name="ESO Timeline"/&gt; Because CERN (like ESO) had sophisticated instrumentation, the astronomy organisation frequently turned to the nuclear-research body for advice and a collaborative agreement between ESO and CERN was signed in 1970. Several months later, ESO's telescope division moved into a CERN building in [[Geneva]] and ESO's Sky Atlas Laboratory was established on CERN property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=ESO's Early History |author=Adriaan Blaauw |publisher=ESO |date=1991 |pages=169, 179}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESO's European departments moved into the new ESO headquarters in [[Garching bei München|Garching]] (near [[Munich]]), Germany in 1980.

Although ESO is headquartered in Germany, its telescopes and observatories are in northern Chile, where the organisation operates advanced [[Observatory|ground-based]] astronomical facilities:
* [[La Silla Observatory|La Silla]], which hosts the [[New Technology Telescope]] (NTT)
* [[Paranal Observatory|Paranal]], where the [[Very Large Telescope]] (VLT) is located
* [[Llano de Chajnantor Observatory|Llano de Chajnantor]], which hosts the APEX ([[Atacama Pathfinder Experiment]]) [[submillimetre astronomy|submillimetre telescope]] and where ALMA, the [[Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array]], is located

These are among the best locations for astronomical observations in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almaobservatory.org/en/about-alma/location/why-chile | title = The best observing sites on Earth | accessdate = 2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ESO project is the [[Extremely Large Telescope]] (ELT), a 40-metre-class telescope based on a five-mirror design and the formerly planned [[Overwhelmingly Large Telescope]]. The ELT will be the largest visible and near-infrared telescope in the world. ESO began its design in early 2006, and aimed to begin construction in 2012.&lt;ref name="The E-ELT project"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/eelt/ | title = The E-ELT project | accessdate = 2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction work at the ELT site started in June 2014.&lt;ref name=beginning&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/european-extremely-large-telescope-to-break-ground-using-dynamite-live-later-today-9548123.html|title=European Extremely Large Telescope to break ground (using dynamite) live later today |author=James Vincent|publisher=The Independent|date=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As decided by the ESO council on 26 April 2010, a fourth site ([[Cerro Armazones]]) is to be home to ELT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=26 April 2010 |title=E-ELT Site Chosen |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1018/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://site2010.sai.msu.ru/section/4| title = Comprehensive characterization of astronomical sites| accessdate = 2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.dfa.uv.cl/sitetestingdata/index.htm/4| title = Conference Astronomical Site Testing Data in Chile| accessdate = 2011-10-04}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year about 2,000 requests are made for the use of ESO telescopes, for four to six times more nights than are available. Observations made with these instruments appear in a number of peer-reviewed publications annually; in 2017, more than 1,000 reviewed papers based on ESO data were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/libraries/edocs/ESO/ESOstats.pdf| title = ESO Publication Statistics| accessdate = 2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ESO telescopes generate large amounts of data at a high rate, which are stored in a permanent archive facility at ESO headquarters. The archive contains more than 1.5&amp;nbsp;million images (or spectra) with a total volume of about 65&amp;nbsp;terabytes (65,000,000,000,000&amp;nbsp;bytes) of data.

La Silla, located in the southern [[Atacama Desert]] {{convert|600|km}} north of [[Santiago de Chile]] at an altitude of {{convert|2400|m}}, is the home of ESO's original observation site. Like other observatories in the area, La Silla is far from sources of [[light pollution]] and has one of the darkest night skies on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chile.travel/en/what-to-do/astronomy/touristic-observatories.html |title=Observatories in Chile |accessdate=2011-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923095254/http://chile.travel/en/what-to-do/astronomy/touristic-observatories.html |archivedate=2011-09-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In La Silla, ESO operates three telescopes: a 3.6-metre telescope, the New Technology Telescope (NTT) and the 2.2-metre Max-Planck-ESO Telescope.

The observatory hosts visitor instruments, attached to a telescope for the duration of an observational run and then removed. La Silla also hosts national telescopes, such as the 1.2-metre Swiss and the 1.5-metre Danish telescopes.

About 300 reviewed publications annually are attributable to the work of the observatory. Discoveries made with La Silla telescopes include the [[High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher|HARPS-spectrograph]] detection of the planets orbiting within the [[Gliese 581 planetary system]], which contains the first known rocky planet in a habitable zone outside the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=25 April 2007|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0722/ | publisher=ESO | title = Astronomers Find First Earth-like Planet in Habitable Zone | accessdate = 2011-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obswww.unige.ch/%7Eudry/udry_preprint.pdf | title = The HARPS search for southern extra-solar planets | accessdate = 2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several telescopes at La Silla played a role in linking [[gamma-ray burst]]s, the most energetic explosions in the universe since the [[Big Bang]], with the explosions of massive stars. The ESO La Silla Observatory also played a role in the study of supernova [[SN 1987A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=24 February 2007 |title=SN 1987A's Twentieth Anniversary |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0708/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== ESO 3.6-metre telescope ====
{{Main|ESO 3.6 m Telescope}}
The ESO 3.6-metre telescope began operations in 1977. It has been upgraded, including the installation of a new [[secondary mirror]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/lasilla/telescopes/3p6/ | title = The ESO 3.6m Telescope | accessdate = 2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conventionally designed [[Telescope#Telescope mountings|horseshoe-mount]] telescope was primarily used for [[infrared]] [[spectroscopy]]; it now hosts the HARPS spectrograph, used in search of [[extra-solar planets]] and for [[asteroseismology]]. The telescope was designed for very high long-term [[radial velocity]] accuracy (on the order of 1&amp;nbsp;m/s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/lasilla/instruments/harps/overview.html | title = HARPS: The Planet Hunter | accessdate = 2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== New Technology Telescope ====
{{Main|New Technology Telescope}}

The New Technology Telescope (NTT) is an [[Altazimuth mount|altazimuth]], 3.58-metre [[Ritchey-Chrétien telescope]], inaugurated in 1989 and the first in the world with a computer-controlled main mirror. The flexible mirror's shape is adjusted during observation to preserve optimal image quality. The secondary mirror position is also adjustable in three directions. This technology (developed by ESO and known as [[active optics]]) is now applied to all major telescopes, including the VLT and the future ELT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/publications/messenger/archive/no.142-dec10/messenger-no142-41-41.pdf| title = Raymond Wilson honoured with two prestigious prizes | accessdate = 2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design of the octagonal enclosure housing the NTT is innovative. The telescope dome is relatively small and ventilated by a system of flaps directing airflow smoothly across the mirror, reducing turbulence and resulting in sharper images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/lasilla/ntt.html | title = ESO NTT | accessdate = 2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== MPG/ESO 2.2-metre telescope ====
{{Main|MPG/ESO telescope}}

The 2.2-metre telescope has been in operation at La Silla since early 1984, and is on indefinite loan to ESO from the [[Max Planck Society]] (''Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften'', or MPG, in German). Telescope time is shared between MPG and ESO observing programmes, while operation and maintenance of the telescope are ESO's responsibility.

Its instrumentation includes a 67-million-pixel wide-field imager (WFI) with a [[Field of view#Astronomy|field of view]] as large as the full moon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/lasilla/instruments/wfi/index.html | title = WFI—Wide Field Imager | accessdate = 2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has taken many images of celestial objects. Other instruments used are [[GROND]] (Gamma-Ray Burst Optical Near-Infrared Detector), which seeks the afterglow of gamma-ray bursts—the most powerful explosions in the universe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=6 July 2007 |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0730/ | title = GROND Takes Off |publisher=ESO| accessdate = 2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the high-resolution spectrograph FEROS (Fiber-fed Extended Range Optical Spectrograph), used to make detailed studies of stars.

La Silla also hosts several national and project telescopes not operated by ESO. Among them are the Swiss Euler Telescope, the Danish National Telescope and the REM, TRAPPIST and TAROT telescopes.&lt;ref name="National and Project Telescopes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/lasilla/telescopes/national.html | title = National and Project Telescopes | accessdate = 2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Euler Telescope]] is a 1.2-metre telescope built and operated by the [[Geneva Observatory]] in Switzerland. It is used to conduct high-precision radial velocity measurements primarily used in the search for large extrasolar planets in the southern celestial hemisphere. Its first discovery was a planet orbiting [[Gliese 86]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=24 November 1998|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso9855/ | title = Extrasolar Planet in Double Star System Discovered from La Silla |publisher=ESO| accessdate = 2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other observing programmes focus on [[variable star]]s, [[asteroseismology]], gamma-ray bursts, monitoring [[Active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] (AGN) and [[gravitational lens]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obswww.unige.ch/exoplanets/coralie.html| title = Southern Sky extrasolar Planet search Programme | accessdate = 2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1.54-metre ''Danish National Telescope'' was built by [[Sir Howard Grubb, Parsons and Co|Grubb-Parsons]] and has been in use at La Silla since 1979. The telescope has an [[Off-axis optical system|off-axis]] mount, and the optics are a Ritchey-Chrétien design. Because of the telescope's mount and limited space inside the dome, it has significant pointing restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/lasilla/telescopes/d1p5/ |title = The Danish Telescope at La Silla | accessdate = 2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[Rapid Eye Mount telescope]] is a small rapid-reaction automatic telescope with a primary {{convert|60|cm|in|adj=on}} mirror. The telescope, in an [[altazimuth mount]], began operation in October 2002. The primary purpose of the telescope is to follow the afterglow of the GRBs detected by the [[Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Mission]] satellite.&lt;ref name="National and Project Telescopes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rem.inaf.it/ | title = Rapid Eye Mount | accessdate = 2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Belgian [[TRAPPIST]] is a joint venture between the [[University of Liège]] and Geneva Observatory. The 0.60-metre telescope is specialized in [[comets]], exoplanets, and was one of the few telescopes that observed a [[stellar occultation]] of the dwarf planet [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], revealing that it may be smaller than [[Pluto]].&lt;ref name=beatty&gt;Newscientist.com, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19697-former-tenth-planet-may-be-smaller-than-pluto.html Kelly Beatty - Former 'tenth planet' may be smaller than Pluto], November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''Quick-action telescope for transient objects'', [[TAROT-South robotic observatory|TAROT]], is a very fast-moving optical robotic telescope able to observe a gamma-ray burst from its beginning. Satellites detecting GRBs send signals to TAROT, which can provide a [[Minute of arc#Astronomy|sub-arc second]] position to the astronomical community. Data from the TAROT telescope is also useful in studying the evolution of GRBs, the physics of a [[Meteoroid#Fireball|fireball]] and its surrounding material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tarot.obs-hp.fr/tarot/ |title=TAROT website |accessdate=2011-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830125651/http://tarot.obs-hp.fr/tarot/ |archivedate=2011-08-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is operated from the [[Haute-Provence Observatory]] in France.

=== Paranal ===
{{Main|Paranal Observatory}}

The Paranal Observatory is located atop [[Cerro Paranal]] in the Atacama Desert in northern Chile.

The main facility at Paranal is the VLT, which consists of four nearly identical {{convert|8.2|m|adj=on}} unit telescopes (UTs), each hosting two or three instruments. These large telescopes can also work together in groups of two or three as a giant [[Interferometry|interferometer]]. The ESO Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI) allows astronomers to see details up to 25 times finer than those seen with the individual telescopes. The light beams are combined in the VLTI with a complex system of mirrors in underground tunnels, where the light paths must diverge less than 1/1000&amp;nbsp;mm over 100 metres. The VLTI can achieve an [[angular resolution]] of milliarcseconds, equivalent to the ability to see the headlights of a car on the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/vlt.html | title = The Very Large Telescope | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of the UTs had its [[First light (astronomy)|first light]] in May 1998, and was offered to the astronomical community on 1 April 1999.&lt;ref name="A Great Moment for Astronomy"&gt;{{cite news |date=27 May 1998 |title=A Great Moment for Astronomy|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso9820/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other telescopes followed suit in 1999 and 2000, making the VLT fully operational. Four 1.8-metre auxiliary telescopes (ATs), installed between 2004 and 2007, have been added to the VLTI for accessibility when the UTs are used for other projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=22 December 2006 |title=Little Brother Joins the Large Family |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0651/|publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from the VLT have led to the publication of an average of more than one peer-reviewed scientific paper per day; in 2017, over 600 reviewed scientific papers were published based on VLT data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/sci/libraries/edocs/ESO/ESOstats.pdf| title = ESO Publication Statistics| accessdate = 2018-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VLT's scientific discoveries include imaging an extrasolar planet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=21 November 2008 |title=Beta Pictoris planet finally imaged? |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0842/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; tracking individual stars moving around the [[supermassive black hole]] at the centre of the Milky Way&lt;ref name="eso.org"&gt;{{cite news |date=10 December 2008 |title=Unprecedented 16-Year Long Study Tracks Stars Orbiting Milky Way Black Hole |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0846/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and observing the afterglow of the furthest known gamma-ray burst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=19 September 2008 |title=NASA's Swift Catches Farthest Ever Gamma-Ray Burst |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/farthest_grb.html |publisher=NASA | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Paranal inauguration in March 1999, names of celestial objects in the [[Mapuche language]] were chosen to replace the technical designations of the four VLT Unit Telescopes (UT1–UT4). An essay contest was prior arranged for schoolchildren in the region concerning the meaning of these names which attracted many entries dealing with the cultural heritage of ESO's host country. A 17-year-old adolescent from [[Chuquicamata]], near [[Calama, Chile|Calama]], submitted the winning essay and was awarded an amateur telescope during the inauguration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=6 March 1999 |title=VLT Unit Telescopes Named at Paranal Inauguration |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso9921/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four unit telescopes, UT1, UT2, UT3 and UT4, are since known as ''Antu'' (sun), ''Kueyen'' (moon), ''Melipal'' (Southern Cross), and ''Yepun'' (Evening Star),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/vlt/vlt-names.html | title = Names of VLT Unit Telescopes | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the latter having been originally mistranslated as "Sirius", instead of "Venus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/vlt/yepun.html | title = On the Meaning of "YEPUN" | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy]] (VISTA) is housed on the peak adjacent to the one hosting the VLT, sharing observational conditions. VISTA's main mirror is {{convert|4.1|m}} across, a highly curved mirror for its size and quality. Its deviations from a perfect surface are less than a few thousandths the thickness of a human hair, and its construction and polishing presented a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=11 December 2009 |title=VISTA: Pioneering New Survey Telescope Starts Work |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0949/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VISTA was conceived and developed by a consortium of 18 universities in the United Kingdom led by [[Queen Mary, University of London]], and it became an in-kind contribution to ESO as part of the UK's ratification agreement. The telescope's design and construction were managed by the Science and Technology Facilities Council's [[UK Astronomy Technology Centre]] (STFC, UK ATC). Provisional acceptance of VISTA was formally granted by ESO at the December 2009 ceremony at ESO headquarters in Garching, which was attended by representatives of Queen Mary, University of London and STFC. Since then the telescope has been operated by ESO,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=11 December 2009 |title=First stunning images captured by VISTA Telescope |url=http://www.stfc.ac.uk/News+and+Events/13651.aspx |publisher=STFC |accessdate=2011-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308055042/http://www.stfc.ac.uk/News+and+Events/13651.aspx |archivedate=8 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; capturing quality images since it began operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=10 February 2010 |title=Orion in a New Light |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1006/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=5 January 2011 |title=VISTA Stares Deeply into the Blue Lagoon |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1101/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[VLT Survey Telescope]] (VST) is a state-of-the-art, {{convert|2.6|m|adj=on}} telescope equipped with OmegaCAM, a 268-megapixel CCD camera with a field of view four times the area of the full moon. It complements VISTA by surveying the sky in visible light. The VST (which became operational in 2011) is the result of a joint venture between ESO and the [[Astronomical Observatory of Capodimonte]] (Naples), a research centre at the Italian National Institute for Astrophysics [[INAF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1119/| title = First Images from the VLT Survey Telescope | accessdate = 2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vstportal.oacn.inaf.it/ |title=VLT Survey Telescope Center at Naples Web Portal |accessdate=2011-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305031627/http://vstportal.oacn.inaf.it/ |archivedate=2007-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific goals of both surveys range from the nature of dark energy to assessing [[near-Earth object]]s. Teams of European astronomers will conduct the surveys; some will cover most of the southern sky, while others will focus on smaller areas. VISTA and the VST are expected to produce large amounts of data; a single picture taken by VISTA has 67&amp;nbsp;megapixels, and images from OmegaCam (on the VST) will have 268&amp;nbsp;megapixels. The two survey telescopes collect more data every night than all the other instruments on the VLT combined. The VST and VISTA produce more than 100 terabytes of data per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/surveytelescopes.html | title = The ESO Survey Telescopes | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Llano de Chajnantor is a {{convert|5100|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} plateau in the Atacama Desert, about {{convert|50|km}} east of [[San Pedro de Atacama]]. The site is {{convert|750|m}} higher than the [[Mauna Kea Observatory]] and {{convert|2400|m}} higher than the VLT in Cerro Paranal. It is dry and inhospitable to humans, but a good site for [[submillimetre astronomy]]; because [[water vapor]] molecules in [[Earth's atmosphere]] absorb and attenuate [[submillimetre radiation]], a dry site is required for this type of [[radio astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alma.nrao.edu/projectbk/construction/chap14/chap14.html|title = ALMA Site Characterization and Monitoring| accessdate = 2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The telescopes are:
* [[Atacama Cosmology Telescope]] (ACT; not operated by ESO)
* [[Atacama Pathfinder Experiment]] 
* [[Atacama Large Millimeter Array]] 
* [[QUIET|Q/U Imaging Experiment]] (QUIET; not operated by ESO) &lt;!-- Though the Wikipedia article is horribly outdated --&gt;
* [[POLARBEAR]] (on the Huan Tran Telescope; not operated by ESO)

APEX and ALMA are telescopes designed for millimetre and submillimetre astronomy. This type of astronomy is a relatively unexplored frontier, revealing a universe which cannot be seen in more-familiar visible or infrared light and ideal for studying the "cold universe"; light at these wavelengths shines from vast cold clouds in interstellar space at temperatures only a few tens of degrees above [[absolute zero]]. Astronomers use this light to study the chemical and physical conditions in these [[molecular cloud]]s, the dense regions of gas and cosmic dust where new stars are being born. Seen in visible light, these regions of the universe are often dark and obscure due to dust; however, they shine brightly in the millimetre and submillimetre portions of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. This wavelength range is also ideal for studying some of the earliest (and most distant) galaxies in the universe, whose light has been [[redshift]]ed into longer wavelengths from the expansion of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/apex.html |title = ESO APEX | accessdate = 2011-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://almascience.nrao.edu/about-alma/alma-site |title = ALMA Site – ALMA Science Portal | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Atacama Pathfinder Experiment ====

The Atacama Pathfinder Experiment telescope is operated by ESO in collaboration with the [[Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy]] in [[Bonn]], Germany and the [[Onsala Space Observatory]] in [[Onsala]], Sweden. It is a {{convert|12|m|adj=on}}-diameter telescope operating at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths, the largest of its kind in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apex-telescope.org/|title = Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment APEX| accessdate = 2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/apex.html |title = ESO APEX | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; APEX is a precursor of ALMA (the Atacama Large Millimeter Array), an [[astronomical interferometer]] which ESO and its international partners is building on the Chajnantor plateau. APEX is based on a prototype ALMA antenna that is modified to be operated as single dish [[radio telescope]].

==== Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array ====
{{Main|Atacama Large Millimeter Array}}

ALMA is an astronomical interferometer of innovative design, initially composed of 66 high-precision antennas and operating at wavelengths of 0.3 to 3.6&amp;nbsp;mm. Its main array will have 50 {{convert|12|m|adj=on}} antennas acting as a single [[interferometer]]. An additional compact array of four 12-metre and twelve {{convert|7|m|adj=on}} antennas is also planned. The antennas can be arranged across the desert plateau over distances from 150 metres to {{convert|16|km}}, which will give ALMA a variable "zoom". The array will be able to probe the universe at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution, with vision up to ten times sharper than the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. These images will complement those made with the [[VLT Interferometer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/alma.html |title = ESO ALMA | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; ALMA is a collaboration between East Asia (Japan and [[Taiwan]]), Europe (ESO), North America (USA and Canada) and Chile.

The scientific goals of ALMA include studying the origin and formation of stars, galaxies, and planets with observations of molecular gas and dust, studying distant galaxies towards the edge of the observable universe and studying [[Cosmic microwave background radiation|relic radiation]] from the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://almascience.nrao.edu/alma-science |title = ALMA Science—ALMA Science Portal | accessdate = 2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A call for ALMA science proposals was issued on 31 March 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://almascience.nrao.edu/call-for-proposals |title=Call for Proposals—ALMA Science Portal |accessdate=2011-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114071735/https://almascience.nrao.edu/call-for-proposals |archivedate=2011-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and early observations began on 3 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ALMA Early Science Cycle 0 Call for Proposals |url=https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/alma |publisher=NRAO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1137/|title = ALMA Opens its Eyes| accessdate = 2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Search for extrasolar planets ===
[[File:ESO OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb.jpg|thumb|alt=Icy planet and its very-distant star|Artist's impression of an icy [[exoplanet]]]]

"Is there life elsewhere in the universe?" is one of humankind's most profound unanswered questions. A step in the attempt to answer this question is the search for planets outside the Solar System. ESO's observatories are equipped with an arsenal of instruments for finding, studying, and monitoring [[extrasolar planet]]s. In 2004, the Very Large Telescope detected a faint glow from an apparent planet orbiting a star about 200 light-years from earth. A year later, this detection was confirmed as the first picture of an exoplanet ever recorded. Although the planet is large (five times more massive than [[Jupiter]]), this observation is a first step toward identifying the physical structure and chemical composition of exoplanets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=30 April 2005 |title=Yes, it is the Image of an Exoplanet |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0515/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2005/04/29/first-exoplanet-imaged/ | title = Bad Astronomy, FIRST EXOPLANET IMAGE CONFIRMED! | accessdate = 2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that planets seem very common in the universe they are tiny, faint objects at cosmic scales; this makes their detection difficult with current technology. For this reason, most exoplanets have been detected with indirect methods. Of these, the most successful has been the [[radial velocity method]]. HARPS (the High Accuracy Radial-velocity Planet Searcher) has allowed the discovery of a number of planets with masses below that of [[Neptune]] orbiting nearby stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=12 September 2011 |title=Fifty New Exoplanets Discovered by HARPS |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1134/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, few of these planets are among the smallest ever discovered, or reside in its star's [[habitable zone]]. The possibility exists that one of these planets is covered by oceans; this discovery is an encouraging result in the search for planets which could support life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/science/exoplanets.html | title = ESO Exoplanets | accessdate = 2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish 1.54-metre telescope at La Silla participated in the discovery of one of the most Earth-like planets found to date. The planet, detected using the [[microlensing]] technique and about five times as massive as Earth, circles its parent star in about 10 years and most certainly has a rocky and icy surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v439/n7075/full/nature04441.html| title = Discovery of a cool planet of 5.5 Earth masses through gravitational microlensing | accessdate = 2011-05-05 | volume=439| doi = 10.1038/nature04441| pmid=16437108| date=January 2006| journal=Nature| pages=437–40 | last1 = Beaulieu | first1 = JP | last2 = Bennett | first2 = DP | last3 = Fouqué | first3 = P | display-authors = 3 | last4 = et al|arxiv = astro-ph/0601563 |bibcode = 2006Natur.439..437B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=25 January 2006 |title=It's Far, It's Small, It's Cool: It's an Icy Exoplanet! |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0603/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Breakthrough Initiatives and the European Southern Observatory (ESO) entered a collaboration&lt;ref name="VLT ESO"&gt;{{cite web|title=VLT to Search for Planets in Alpha Centauri System - ESO Signs Agreement with Breakthrough Initiatives|url=https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1702/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breakthrough Initiatives|url=http://breakthroughinitiatives.org/News/8|website=breakthroughinitiatives.org|accessdate=10 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to enable and implement a search for habitable planets in the nearby star system, Alpha Centauri. The agreement involves Breakthrough Initiatives providing funding for an upgrade to the VISIR (VLT Imager and Spectrometer for mid-Infrared)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VISIR|url=https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/vlt/vlt-instr/visir/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=July 26, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; instrument on ESO's [[Very Large Telescope]] (VLT) in Chile. This upgrade will greatly increase the likelihood of planet detection in the system.

[[File:The Very Large Telescope and the star system Alpha Centauri.jpg|thumb|The Very Large Telescope and the star system Alpha Centauri.&lt;ref name="VLT ESO"/&gt;]]

An objective of the mission would be to make a fly-by of and possibly photograph any Earth-like worlds that might exist in the system.

=== Age of the universe ===
[[File:The Globular Cluster 47 Tu.jpg|thumb|alt=Cluster of stars|Globular Cluster [[47 Tucanae]]]]

With the Very Large Telescope, astronomers have made an independent determination of the age of the universe and shed new light on the earliest stages of the Milky Way. For the first time, they measured the amount of the [[radioactive isotope]] uranium-238 in a star born when the Milky Way was still forming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=7 February 2001 |title=How Old is the Universe? |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0106/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[carbon dating]] over longer timescales, the uranium clock measures the age of a star. It shows that this star is 12.5&amp;nbsp;billion years old. Because the star cannot be older than the universe itself, the universe must be older than this. This agrees with known [[cosmology]], which gives an [[age of the universe]] of 13.8&amp;nbsp;billion years. The star (and the Milky Way) must have formed soon after the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/science/stars.html | title = ESO Very Old Stars | accessdate = 2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another result is the first measurement of the [[beryllium]] content of two stars in a Milky Way [[globular cluster]]. With this measurement, astronomers found that the first generation of stars in our galaxy must have formed soon after the end of the 200-million-year "[[Chronology of the universe#Dark Ages|Dark Age]]" following the Big Bang.&lt;ref name="How Old is the Milky Way"&gt;{{cite news |date=17 August 2004 |title=How Old is the Milky Way? |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0425/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Milky Way black hole ===

Astronomers long suspected that a black hole exists at the center of the Milky Way, but their theory was unproven. Conclusive evidence was obtained after 16 years of monitoring the [[Galactic Center]] with ESO telescopes at the La Silla and Paranal observatories.

Stars at the centre of the Milky Way are so densely packed that special imaging techniques (such as [[adaptive optics]]) were needed to boost the resolution of the VLT. Thanks to these techniques, astronomers were able to watch individual stars with unprecedented accuracy as they circled the Galactic Center.&lt;ref name="Surfing a Black Hole"&gt;{{cite news |date=16 October 2002 |title=Surfing a Black Hole |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0226/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their paths conclusively demonstrated that they were orbiting in the immense gravitational grip of a supermassive black hole nearly three million times more massive than the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=29 October 2003 |title=Messages from the Abyss |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0330/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VLT observations also revealed flashes of infrared light emerging from the region at regular intervals. While the cause of this phenomenon is unknown, observers have suggested that the black hole may be spinning rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=12 October 2008 |title=Unprecedented 16-Year Long Study Tracks Stars Orbiting Milky Way Black Hole |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0846/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VLT has also peered into the centre of galaxies beyond our own, where clear signs of activity produced by supermassive black holes are found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=8 March 2001 |title=A Supermassive Black Hole in a Nearby Galaxy |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0109/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[active galaxy]] NGC 1097, a complex network of filaments spiraling from the main part of the galaxy to its centre was seen in great detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=17 October 2005 |title=Feeding the Monster |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0534/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gamma-ray bursts ===

[[Gamma-ray burst]]s (GRBs) are bursts of highly energetic gamma rays lasting from less than one second to several minutes. They are known to occur at great distances from earth, near the limits of the observable universe.

The VLT has observed the afterglow of the farthest known gamma-ray burst. With a measured redshift of 8.2, the light from this very remote astronomical source has taken more than 13&amp;nbsp;billion years to reach the earth. It occurred when the universe was less than 600&amp;nbsp;million years old (less than five percent of its present age), and released 300 times as much energy in a few seconds as the sun will in its entire lifetime (more than 10&amp;nbsp;billion years).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 April 2009 |title=The Most Distant Object Yet Discovered in the Universe |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0917/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nature of these explosions has long been a mystery. Observations show that GRBs are one of two types: short- (less than a few seconds) and long-duration. Until 2003, it was suspected that two different types of cosmic event caused them. In 2003, ESO telescopes followed the aftermath of an explosion for one month. Their data showed that the light had similar properties to that of a supernova, and allowed astronomers to link long-duration GRBs with the ultimate explosions of massive stars ([[hypernova]]e).&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite news |date=18 June 2003 |title=Cosmological Gamma-Ray Bursts and Hypernovae Conclusively Linked |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0318/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, ESO telescopes detected visible light after a short-duration burst and tracked this light for three weeks. The conclusion was that short-duration bursts could not be caused by a hypernova; instead, it is thought that they originate in the violent merges of neutron stars or black holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=14 December 2005 |title=Witnessing the Flash from a Black Hole's Cannibal Act |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0541/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Observations of gamma-ray-burst afterglows were coordinated between the VLT and the [[Atacama Pathfinder Experiment]] (APEX) to identify the possible counterpart (and its decay) at submillimeter wavelengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/gcn/gcn3/11098.gcn3 |title = GCN CIRCULAR, GRB 100814A: Submm observations from APEX, NASA email message}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Digital archives ===
[[File:Science-archive-data.jpg|alt=Two men standing in front of a bank of computers|ESO science archive|thumb]]

The Science Archive Operation Group receives and redistributes ESO data and provides archival support. About 200&amp;nbsp;Terabytes (TB) of public data are distributed per year through the ESO archive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Archive and the Digital Universe|url=https://www.eso.org/public/science/archive/|website=www.eso.org|accessdate=5 December 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archive is about 1.01&amp;nbsp;Petabytes (PB), with an input rate of about 131&amp;nbsp;TB per year; this is being increased by a factor of 10 or so due to the survey telescopes' data-production rate.

Breakthroughs in telescope, detector and computer technology now allow astronomical surveys to produce large numbers of images, spectra and catalogues. These data sets cover the sky at all wavelengths, from gamma- and X-rays through optical, infrared and radio waves. Astronomers are developing ways to make the large amount of data easily accessible. These techniques use the grid paradigm of distributed computing with seamless, transparent access to data through virtual observatories (VOs). As a physical observatory has telescopes with unique astronomical instruments, a VO consists of data centres with unique collections of astronomical data, software systems and processing capabilities. This global, community-based initiative is being developed under the International Virtual Observatory Alliance&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivoa.net/ International Virtual Observatory Alliance]. Ivoa.net. Retrieved on 2011-04-05.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Europe as part of the EURO-VO project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euro-vo.org/ European Virtual Observatory]. Euro-vo.org. Retrieved on 2011-04-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

VOs have proven their effectiveness in a number of ways, including discovering 31 optically faint, obscured [[quasar]] candidates in existing [[Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey]](GOODS) fields (quadrupling the number previously found). The discovery means that surveys of supermassive black holes have underestimated their numbers by a factor of two to five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=28 May 2004 |title=Missing Black Holes Driven Out |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0418/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Proxima Centauri b, the closest potentially habitable exoplanet'''
: An ESO team led by Guillem Anglada-Escudé found [[Proxima Centauri b]]. The discovery was reported in ''Nature'' on 24 August 2016.
* '''Stars orbiting Milky Way black hole'''
: Several of ESO telescopes were used in a 16-year study to obtain the most detailed view to date of the surroundings of the [[Galactic Center#Supermassive black hole|supermassive black hole at the centre of the galaxy]].&lt;ref name="eso.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Surfing a Black Hole"/&gt;
* '''Accelerating universe'''
: Two independent research teams have shown that the universe's expansion is [[Accelerating universe|accelerating]], based on exploding-star observations with astronomical telescopes at La Silla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=15 December 1998 |title=Distant Supernovae Indicate Ever-Expanding Universe |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso9861/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research teams were awarded the 2011 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for their discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=4 October 2011 |title=Scientists studying universe's expansion win Nobel Prize in Physics|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/04/world/europe/sweden-nobel-physics/ |publisher=CNN| accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Oldest known Milky Way star'''
: Using ESO's VLT, astronomers have measured the age of the [[NGC 6397|oldest known star]] in the [[Milky Way]]. At 13.2&amp;nbsp;billion years, the star was born in the universe's earliest era of star formation.&lt;ref name="How Old is the Milky Way"/&gt; However, the [[oldest star]] seems to be 13.6&amp;nbsp;billion years old, and the [[Methuselah star]] might be even older.
* '''Measuring exoplanet spectra and atmosphere'''
: The atmosphere around an [[exoplanet]] has been analysed for the first time with the VLT. The planet, [[GJ 1214b]], was studied as it passed in front of its parent star and [[starlight]] passed through the planet's atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=13 January 2010 |title=VLT Captures First Direct Spectrum of an Exoplanet |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1002/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''First image of exoplanet'''
: The VLT has obtained the [[2M1207|first image]] of a planet outside the [[Solar System]]. The 5-Jupiter-mass planet orbits a failed star—a [[brown dwarf]]—at a distance of 55 times the mean Earth-Sun distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=10 September 2004 |title=Is This Speck of Light an Exoplanet? |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0428/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Rich planetary system'''
: Astronomers using [[HARPS]] have discovered a planetary system (with at least five planets) orbiting a sunlike star, [[HD 10180]]. Two other planets may be present, one of which would have the lowest mass ever found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=24 August 2010 |title=Richest Planetary System Discovered |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1035/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Supermassive black hole flares at Milky Way centre'''
: The VLT and APEX collaborated to study violent flares from the [[supermassive black hole]] at the centre of the Milky Way, revealing material stretched as it orbits in the intense gravitational field near the central black hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=18 October 2008 |title=Astronomers detect matter torn apart by black hole |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0841/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Gamma-ray bursts'''
: ESO telescopes have provided proof that long [[gamma-ray bursts]] are linked with the [[Supernova|explosion of massive stars]]; short gamma-ray bursts seem to be produced by merging [[neutron star]]s.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;
* '''Milky Way stellar motion'''
: After more than 1,000 nights of observation at La Silla over a 15-year period, astronomers have determined the motion of more than 14,000 sunlike stars in the vicinity of the sun (demonstrating that the Milky Way is more turbulent and chaotic than previously thought).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=6 April 2004 |title=Milky Way Past Was More Turbulent Than Previously Known |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0411/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Cosmic-temperature measurements'''
: The VLT has detected, for the first time, carbon-monoxide molecules in a galaxy located almost 11&amp;nbsp;billion light-years away. This has allowed astronomers to obtain a precise measurement of cosmic temperature at such a remote location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=13 May 2008 |title=A Molecular Thermometer for the Distant Universe |url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso0813/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Publications ===
[[File:Esocast hd.jpg|thumb|alt=ESOcast logo: "ESO" in a blue square, with blue radio waves emanating from it|ESOcast is a video [[podcast]] series with the latest news and research in astronomy.&lt;ref name=esocast&gt;{{cite web |title=ESOcast |url=http://www.eso.org/public/videos/archive/category/esocast/ |work=ESO Videos |publisher=ESO |accessdate=18 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

ESO press releases describe scientific, technical and organisational developments and achievements and results obtained by scientists with ESO facilities. The organisation publishes three types of press releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/outreach/pressmedia.html | title = ESO Press Room | accessdate = 2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science releases describe results (usually appearing in a peer-reviewed journal) involving data from ESO observatories or staff. Organisational releases cover a range of themes related to ESO operations, including news on current and future observatories, new astronomical instruments and announcements of exhibitions worldwide. ESO also selects its best astronomical images, and presents them publicly in periodic photo releases. All press releases (dating back to 1985) are available online. There are child-friendly versions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=13 April 2011 |title=Space Scoop: Astronomy News for Children  |url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ann11018/ |publisher=ESO | accessdate=2011-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and press releases translated into the languages of ESO's member countries.

''The Messenger'' is a quarterly journal which has presented ESO's activities to the public since May 1974. All back copies are available for download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eso.org/sci/publications/messenger/ | title=The Messenger | publisher=ESO | accessdate=December 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESO also publishes announcements&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/announcements/ | title = ESO Announcements | accessdate = 2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pictures of the Week&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.so.org/public/images/potw/ | title = ESO Picture of the Week | accessdate = 2011-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; on its website. Announcements are shorter than press releases (typically less than 200 words) highlighting stories and events of interest to the community. Pictures of the Week show beautiful (or interesting) photos from ESO telescopes, and may highlight recent events or archival photos. All former entries are available on the website.

ESOcast&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eso.org/public/videos/archive/category/esocast/ | title = ESOcast| accessdate = 2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a video-podcast series dedicated to reporting news and research from ESO. The universe's frontier is explored with "Doctor J" (Dr. Joe Liske, a German astronomer at ESO). Liske's scientific interests are in cosmology, particularly [[galaxy evolution]] and [[quasars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eso.org/~jliske/ |title=Joe Liske's home |accessdate=2011-05-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726210211/http://www.eso.org/~jliske/ |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[IMAX]] documentary ''[[Hidden Universe 3D]]'' was produced in cooperation of Cinema Productions, [[Film Victoria]], [[Swinburne University of Technology]], and the European Southern Observatory.

'''Family literacy''' is a method of [[education]]. Relatively new, family literacy is being put into practice in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[South Africa]].

==Philosophy==
The roots of family literacy as an educational method come from the belief that “the parent is the child’s first teacher.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Salisbury University - May Literacy Centre|url=http://www.salisbury.edu/seidel/mayliteracycenter/FamilyLit.html|publisher=Salisbury.edu|accessdate=11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have demonstrated that adults who have a higher level of education tend to not only become productive citizens with enhanced social and economic capacity in society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowen|first=Howard|title=Investment in Learning.

Establishing family literacy programs is the most effective strategy to increase parental involvement and literacy development. The purpose of parental literacy curriculum is to increase students’ academic achievement. When family literacy programs are established parents become advocates for their child’s literacy. Simultaneously students’ literacy excels as parents become empowered. When parents are empowered they become active lifelong participants in their child’s education &lt;ref name="familyliteracyprogram1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.familyliteracyprogram.org/ |title=&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Family Literacy Program&amp;nbsp; |publisher=Familyliteracyprogram.org |date= |accessdate=2015-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150717193539/http://www.familyliteracyprogram.org/ |archive-date=2015-07-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Comprehensive family [[literacy]] services provide a [[holism|holistic]], fully integrated, family-focused approach, providing parents and children most in need of improving their literacy skills with intensive, frequent, and long-term educational and non-educational services. Family literacy services make sustainable changes in a family by integrating all of the following activities:
* [[Adult Education]]: designed to extend basic academic level, think critically and creatively, solve problems, set and achieve goals, and acquire successful workplace and interpersonal skills.
* Childhood Education: designed to promote the growth and development of young children and to engage parents in their child’s educational program in order to foster meaningful involvement that will be maintained throughout the child’s educational career.
* Parent Education: provides instruction on how children grow, develop, and learn. It addresses issues critical to family well-being, connects parents with community resources, and provides opportunities for parents to network and develop mutual support systems.
* Interactive Parent/Child Activities: provides parents and children the opportunity to share their newly developed literacy experiences. Parents and children interact together, enriching their relationship through reciprocal learning that takes place, enabling them to become true partners in education.

==Examples==
*Adult Education:  The goal of educating parents is to empower and provide resources to parents who are a child's first teacher. Adult Education helps to rebuild relationships between parents and the school's faculty and staff. Some classes and activities provided for parents at the Prairie State College Family Literacy Project are [[English as Second Language]] classes, Adult Basic Education classes, General Education Development certifications, and vocational training.
*Building Family: The Leadership Program’s nationally recognized Building Family program invites parents into school communities with workshops that are hands-on, informative, and fun. These successful workshops meet a wide variety of parent needs and interests: from personal health and professional growth to nurturing the creative spirit and parenting strategies for promoting children’s academic achievement. Backed by The Leadership Program’s decades of experience facilitating more than 2,000 Building Family workshops for over 20,000 public school parents, this inspiring guidebook includes thirty-three complete workshops with convenient step-by-step instructions. Use it to lead dynamic experiences that will inspire enduring parent engagement in your own school community.
*Childhood Education: Helping to involve parents can be done in a child's learning through play groups, sharing stories and books together, and child-directed play time that all help the child to bond with their parents.
*Parent Education: The family literacy program developed in [[Illinois]] at the Prairie State Family Literacy Program provides parental support about health issues, good nutrition, discipline, and takes parents and children on field trips to purchase books for children to read at home.
*Interactive Parent/Child Activities: The Prairie State Family Literacy Program has developed a special time for interactive activities that they call "P.A.C.T." time. During this P.A.C.T. time there are play groups that involve both parents and their children working together. They are separated by age groups to help guide the interaction and activities.
*Greenman Elementary in [[Illinois]] established the first family literacy project called P.A.L. Parents Advocating Literacy in district 129. Since 2010 over 100 parents have become members of  P.A.L. (Parents Advocating Literacy.) P.A.L. is a family literacy project that teaches parents strategies that teachers use in the classroom every day. Establishing P.A.L. is the most effective approach to increase parental involvement in reading development. The purpose of family literacy curriculum is to increase students’ achievement by connecting school and home. When family literacy is established parents become advocates for their child’s literacy. Through P.A.L. parents become empowered and become lifelong supporters of their child’s education. P.A.L. was implemented district wide in 2013. P.A.L. is also in other districts throughout Illinois.&lt;ref name="familyliteracyprogram1"/&gt;
*F.R.E.D.:Fathers Reading Every Day is a family literacy program developed at Texas A&amp;M University.  In this program, fathers or father figures such as grandparents, uncles, or family friends are encouraged to read to their children every day for four weeks.

The '''FoolProof''' Initiative is a project by the [https://www.foolprooffoundation.org FoolProof Foundation] that teaches consumer [[life skills]] and healthy skepticism to consumers. It teaches consumers to question anyone who wants to impact their money or welfare. Its resources are generally listed under 
[[financial literacy]] resources.

FoolProof was founded by [[Walter Cronkite]] and a group of young people. It provides free, advertising-fee, and comprehensive consumer life skills curriculums for middle and high schools, as well as a consumer newspaper.

The peer-to-peer curriculums use video and audio, games and music in a modular system to teach critical thinking skills and habits that can travel with a consumer through life. It also includes complex as well as basic financial concepts such as understanding [[credit (finance)]] and [[credit score]], getting a [[checking account]] or [[savings account]], and knowing how to use [[credit cards]].

The Initiative, for instance, appears to be one of the most effective in reaching vulnerable young people with meaningful education, rather than programs sponsored by business.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/get-there/wp/2018/01/04/who-do-you-want-to-teach-your-children-about-money/ Washington Post] Article.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its motto is "Use Caution. Question Sellers. Rely on Research."

==Characteristics==

FoolProof is a program designed by young people from across the world to help educate students about financial decisions in a friendly video format using real-life stories. The best part is that FoolProof can be used for free by anyone, no matter their financial aptitude, to help (young) people learn about money and the power of healthy skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.huffingtonpost.com/ralph-nader/dont-be-a-financial-fool_b_9593054.html Huffington Post] Article.&lt;/ref&gt;

Young people generally make common mistakes when it comes to their money. The FoolProof Initiative addresses these problems.

Here is a list of the most common mistakes:

* I impulse buy and don't practice healthy skepticism.
* I don’t have to worry about [[credit (finance)]] yet.
* News is news, whatever the platform or source.
* I believe advertising generally tells me all I need to know about a product or service.
* [[Bad credit]] can’t keep me from getting a job.
* All loan companies have the same rates.
* Posting sensitive and personal information online is okay.
* All [[credit cards]] are alike.
* It’s OK to bounce a few checks.
* It’s OK to make minimum payments on a credit card.
* Paying late occasionally can’t hurt my credit.
* [[Fine print]] isn’t important.
* Young people don’t have a [[credit score]].

== Curriculum ==
Available are a variety of educational programs/curriculums that are tied to state financial literacy standards and guidelines, listed in every state by the [[United States Department of Education]]. FoolProof also teaches financial literacy topics required by the [[Council of Economic Education]].  All programs are available to any consumer for free.

== Endorsements ==
The FoolProof Initiative is endorsed by many consumer-oriented organizations throughout the United States:

* [[Consumer Federation of America]] (CFA), a [[non-profit organization]] founded in 1968 to advance the consumer interest through research, education and advocacy.
* [[National Association of Consumer Advocates]] (NACA) is a nationwide organization of more than 1500 attorneys and consumer advocates who represent and have represented hundreds of thousands of consumers victimized by fraudulent, abusive and predatory business practices.
* The [[Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood]] educates the public about commercialism's impact on kids' wellbeing and advocates for the end of child-targeted marketing. CCFC’s endorsement of FoolProof’s middle and high school curriculums were its first endorsements ever of a screen curriculum.
* [[Public Citizen]] serves as the people’s voice in the nation’s capital.
* [[Credit Abuse Resistance Education]] (CARE) Program is a national program founded by the [[U.S. Bankruptcy Court]], [[United States District Court for the Western District of New York|WDNY]] and the Bankruptcy Committee of the Monroe County Bar Association.  It was founded in 1997 by Bankruptcy Judge John C. Ninfo, II, and as of 2008 has a presence in all 50 states.

'''Friedrich Wilhelm Stein''' (17 December 1879 – 14 November 1961) was a German theologian, conductor, musicologist and church musician. He found in an archive in [[Jena]] the score of the so-called ''[[Jena Symphony]]'', which he published as possibly a work by the young [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. After a long period in [[Kiel]] from 1919 to 1933, teaching at the [[Kiel University]] and as [[Generalmusikdirektor]], he had a leading position in the [[Reichsmusikkammer]] of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in Berlin.

== Career ==
Born Friedrich Wilhelm Stein&lt;ref name="Gerlachsheim" /&gt; in [[Gerlachsheim (Lauda-Königshofen)|Gerlachsheim]],&lt;ref name="Munzinger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gerlachsheim" /&gt; Stein first studied theology in [[Heidelberg University|Heidelberg]] and Berlin. He graduated with the ''Staatsexamen'' in Karlsruhe in 1902.&lt;ref name="Klee588" /&gt; He then studied with [[Philipp Wolfrum]] who, being both a conductor and conductor, became a model for his own work.&lt;ref name="Munzinger" /&gt; Stein played organ concerts, but still studied music and musicology with [[Arthur Nikisch]] and [[Hans Sitt]] at the Leipzig Conservatory until 1906.&lt;ref name="Munzinger" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Prieberg" /&gt; In Leipzig he had close contact with [[Max Reger]] and [[Karl Straube]].&lt;ref name="Munzinger" /&gt;

Stein worked in [[Jena]] from 1906 as an organist for the town and the university. He found in an archive in Jena the orchestral parts of the so-called ''[[Jena Symphony]]'', which he published in 1911, thinking that it might have been written by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]].&lt;ref name="BC"/&gt; He found the name "Beethoven" in two parts, and summarized: "As we do not as yet know of anyone, amongst the followers of Haydn and Mozart towards the end of the 19th century, to whom we could attribute such a composition, which heralds the Master ...".&lt;ref name="Prieser" /&gt; The work was performed as one by Beethoven, until [[H. C. Robbins Landon]], a scholar of [[Joseph Haydn]] and [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], found in 1957 manuscript portions of the symphony in the Landesarchiv in [[Rudolstadt]], by [[Friedrich Witt]].&lt;ref name="Prieser" /&gt;

Stein's [[dissertation]] in 1910 was ''Geschichte des Musikwesens in Heidelberg bis zum Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts'' (History of music in Heideberg until the end of the 18th century).&lt;ref name="Prieberg" /&gt; In 1914 he succeeded Reger as court director of music in [[Meiningen]]. As an academic teacher, he was ''Außerordentlicher Professor'' in Jena from 1913.&lt;ref&gt;Josef Wulf: Kultur im Dritten Reich. Musik. 1989, S. 18&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 he was appointed ''Außerordentlicher Professor'' for musicology in Kiel, and from 1928 also in Ordinarius.&lt;ref name="Klee588" /&gt; In Kiel he was also the organist at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Nikolaikirche, Kiel|de|3=Nikolaikirche (Kiel)|lt=Nikolaikirche}} until 1923 and ''[[Generalmusikdirektor]]'' from 1925 to 1933.&lt;ref name="Prieberg" /&gt;

In 1932 he became a member of the [[Militant League for German Culture|Kampfbund für deutsche Kultur]]. In July 1933, he became ''Reichsleiter der Fachgruppe Musik'' of the ''Kampfbund'', responsible for music.&lt;ref name="Klee588" /&gt; Under the Nazis, he was director of the [[Universität der Künste Berlin|Musikhochschule]] in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Prieberg"/&gt; Among his students was [[Sergiu Celibidache]].&lt;ref name="Oxford" /&gt;

After World War II, he lost all his functions and worked freelance. He was later president of the ''Verband für evangelische Kirchenmusik''.&lt;ref name="Prieberg"/&gt; Stein died in Berlin.&lt;ref name="Kiel" /&gt;

'''FOSS''' ('''Full-Option Science System''') is a research-based science curriculum for grades K—8 developed at the [[Lawrence Hall of Science]], [[University of California, Berkeley]]. FOSS is also an ongoing research project dedicated to improving the learning and teaching of science.

==History==
The FOSS K–8 program was developed at the [[Lawrence Hall of Science]], [[University of California at Berkeley]], under three separate [[National Science Foundation]] grants (1988&lt;ref&gt;FOSS Grades 3–6, NSF Grant MDR-8751727, July 1988 to March 1992&lt;/ref&gt; 1991,&lt;ref&gt;FOSS Grades K–2, NSF Grant MDR-9150097, July 1991 to Dec. 1994&lt;/ref&gt; 1996.&lt;ref&gt;FOSS for Middle School, NSF Grant ESI-9553600, Sept. 1996 to Aug. 2002&lt;/ref&gt;)  The program was originally developed and trial tested in urban and suburban [[San Francisco Bay Area]] school districts and field-tested and implemented nationally in ten sites.  Twenty-six modules were developed for K–6, and nine courses for middle school. The FOSS K–6 program went through a major revision in 2000 and was then adopted in Texas. The program went through a minor revision in 2005. A new, California specific, edition was developed for the California science adoption (K–5) in 2007. FOSS is currently published by Delta Education, a division of School Specialty Inc.

==Pedagogy==
The FOSS program uses several instructional pedagogies: [[inquiry-based learning]] (each investigation is guided by questions), hands-on learning and active investigation (students work with materials and conduct investigations to attempt to answer questions), student-to-student interaction, writing (students keep careful notes in science notebooks), and research/reading (readings are included to enhance or underscore active investigation—students work with materials prior to doing any reading).

==Components==
Each K–6 module consists of a kit of student materials, a teacher guide, and a student reading book. Each middle school course includes a kit of student materials, a teacher guide, a Science Resources book, a lab notebook, and a course-specific multimedia component. The FOSS website, FOSSweb, contains additional online activities for students and resources for parents and teachers. FOSSweb has two sister sites, FOSSweb CA, for the California 2007 edition, and FOSSweb NYC, for New York City teachers using FOSS.

==Program Use and Adoption==
FOSS is in use in every state in the country with over 100,000 teachers and 2 million students and is in approximately 16% of the nation's school districts.  FOSS was the first non-t
ex
tbook curriculum to make the California adoption list (1992) and was adopted in California for the 2007 science adoption (FOSS California K–5).  The program is on many state adoption lists and is used in 50 of the 100 largest U.S. school districts.  FOSS is cited as an exemplary program in publications by nationally recognized organizations in the science reform movement, including National Science Resources Center,&lt;ref&gt;Resources for Teaching Elementary Science, 1996; Science for All Children, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Science Teachers Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Pathways to the National Standards, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

FOSS has been approved as a recommended science program in each of the adoption states in which it has been submitted.

'''Heather Dewey-Hagborg''' (born June 4, 1982, [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]) is an information artist and [[Do-it-yourself biology|bio-hacker]].&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt; She is most noted for her project [[#Stranger Visions|''Stranger Visions'']]: a series of portraits created from [[DNA]] she recovered from discarded items, such as hair, cigarettes and chewing gum while living in [[Brooklyn, New York]].&lt;ref name="Aldous, Peter"/&gt; She sequenced the DNA at the Brooklyn open [[biotechnology]] laboratory, [[Genspace]].&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt; From the extracted DNA, she determined gender, ethnicity and other factors and then used face-generating software and a [[3D printer]] to create a speculative, algorithmically determined 3D portrait. While critical of technology and surveillance, her work has been found disturbing by some critics.&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/09/04/tech/innovation/dna-face-sculptures/ Natalie Angley, "Artist creates faces from DNA left in public"], CNN.com, September 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Spurious Memories.jpg|thumb|''Spurious Memories'' (2007)]]
Dewey-Hagborg is an information and bio artist whose works explore the intersection between art and science.&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Colanduno|first1=Derek|authorlink=Derek Colanduno|title=Pieces of You #223|url=http://www.skepticality.com/piecesofyou|website=Skepticality|accessdate=August 5, 2014|date=December 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a student in the Information Arts program at [[Bennington College]],&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Alec|title=Mask Crusader|journal=New Yorker|date=July 1, 2013|volume=89|issue=19|pages=22–23|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/01/mask-crusader|accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; she participated in computer science classes, which laid the groundwork for the science-based artwork she would later envision using [[algorithms]], [[electronics]], and [[computer programming]].&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; She earned a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in 2003.

Dewey-Hagborg continued refining her work as an artist and computer programmer, studying [[artificial intelligence]],&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; while obtaining a Master of Professional Studies (M.P.S.) in Interactive Telecommunications from [[New York University]] (NYU)&lt;ref name="Schwendener1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwendener|first1=Martha|title=Populism, Technology, and Interactivity|publisher=The New York Times|date=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007. It was here she curated a robotic performance art show called ''Robots on the March!'' in March 2005, and exhibited a piece called ''Lighter than Air: an experiment in constructing an autonomous flying robot''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photosynthesis and Experiments in Sustainable Robotics|url=http://www.atasite.org/calendar/archive/index-24133.html|website=Artists' Television Access|accessdate=August 5, 2014|date=March 25 – April 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewey-Hagborg|first1=Heather|title=Lighter Than Air|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJmu-AzrXH4|website=YouTube|accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a final project at NYU, Dewey-Hagborg explored the question "Can computers be creative?" in an exhibit she called Spurious Memories. She developed an autonomous face categorizing and generating software program which recognized facial components, made comparisons and adjustments, and produced unique representations of the human face through mass exposure to facial images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewey-Hagborg|first1=Heather|title=Spurious Memories|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1elpx1rz_R0|website=YouTube|accessdate=August 5, 2014|date=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of August 2014, Dewey-Hagborg resides in [[Chicago, Illinois]], teaching art and technology studies at the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art and Technology Studies: Faculty|url=http://www.saic.edu/profiles/faculty/heatherdewey-hagborg|website=School of the Art Institute of Chicago|accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an educator her areas of interest include art and technology, multimedia, digital photography, research-based art and programming, and computer science.&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dewey-Hagborg/&gt;

==Selected projects==
===Totem===
[[File:Heather Dewey-Hagborg Totem.jpg|thumb|''Totem'' (2010)]]
Dewey-Hagborg's ''Totem'' (2010) was a site-specific multimedia sculpture characterizing her earlier work. ''Totem'', an idol, was designed to explore the implications of language and artificial intelligence using [[machine learning]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Event Guide July thru December 2011|url=http://issuu.com/groundsforsculpture/docs/summerfall2011|website=ISSUU.com|accessdate=August 5, 2014|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploiting audio surveillance techniques to eavesdrop on and record conversations at the installation site, Dewey-Hagborg wrote algorithms to then isolate word sequences and grammatical structures into commonly used units. Influenced by [[Hebbian theory]], she programmed the sculpture's computer to generate speech based on the most frequently occurring language structures in any given recording period. Over time, the least frequently elicited words or units would fade or be dropped from the sculpture's spoken vocabulary. The remaining units, stored in the sculpture's memory, were then spoken at random intervals.&lt;ref name=Totem/&gt;

The piece also reflected the writings of psychologist [[Julian Jaynes]]. According to Dewey-Hagborg, Jaynes theorized that an early form of human consciousness evolved as a result of hallucinated speech experienced by the Mari civilization of the [[Euphrates]]. The ancient people interpreted water trickling through a goddess statue as whispers or vocalizations from the goddess herself.&lt;ref name=Totem/&gt; Dewey-Hagborg saw a parallel between the "mystical and authoritative power of language in the ancient world and the force of power of technology today"&lt;ref name="Totem"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dewey-Hagborg|first1=Heather|title=Totem|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsTu3Iv1408|website=YouTube|accessdate=August 5, 2014|date=June 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, with this piece, sought to explore how technology is used to shape public opinion and behavior.

Martha Schwendener, of ''[[The New York Times]]'', wrote that ''Totem'' showed promise, but, because of audio difficulties and its fragmented, randomly generated speech, the piece "failed to connect human speech, meaning, and technology in a profound fashion."&lt;ref name="Schwendener, M."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwendener|first1=Martha|title=Populism, Technology, and Interactivity|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/28/nyregion/at-grounds-for-sculpture-works-by-james-surls-and-daniel-henderson-review.html?_r=0|accessdate=August 5, 2014|work=The New York Times|date=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Stranger Visions''===
[[File:Stranger Visions-1.jpg|left|thumb|''Stranger Visions'' Portraits (2012)]]
''Stranger Visions'' (2012&amp;ndash;2014) is a science-based, artistic exploration using DNA as a starting point for Dewey-Hagborg's lifelike, computer generated 3-D portraits.&lt;ref name="Herper, M."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jenkins, M."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jenkins|first1=Mark|title=A 'Cyber' exhibit as timely as the news|work=Washington Post|date=September 18, 2013|page=E18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krulwich, R."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krulwich|first1=Robert|title=Artist plays detective: Can I reconstruct a face from a piece of hair?|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2013/06/28/196307915/artist-plays-detective-can-i-reconstruct-a-face-from-a-piece-of-hair|website=NPR|accessdate=August 7, 2014|date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Le Monde"&gt;{{cite news|title=Trafics optiques a l'heure numerique: a Creteil, l'exposition "Micro Macro" interroge notre perception du reel"|work=Le Monde|date=April 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of her research for ''Stranger Visions'', Dewey-Hagborg took a three-week crash-course&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt; in biotechnology at Genspace, a non-profit, community-based biotechnology laboratory in New York. She was astonished to learn how much an amateur biologist could learn about someone.&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang, L."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Linda|title=Guarding Our DNA: Art project exposes the vulnerability of the genetic material we unintentionally leave behind|journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News|date=June 24, 2013|volume=91|issue=25|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pauwels|first1=Eleanore|title=Leave me your DNA ... and I'll 3-D print your face|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/01/dna-art-recreate-faces|accessdate=August 7, 2014|work=The Guardian|date=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She began the process of extracting DNA from the samples she collected. The extraction involves treating a hair sample, for example, with a gel that dissolves the hair, and a primer specifically developed to help locate characteristics like eye color or gender along the [[genome]].&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gruber, B."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gruber|first1=Ben|title=Artist stirs privacy debate with portraits from DNA|url=https://www.reuters.com/video/2013/07/02/artist-stirs-privacy-debate-with-portrai?videoId=243713123|accessdate=August 7, 2014|work=Reuters|date=July 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewey-Hagborg might repeat this process up to 40 times,&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt; looking for genetic variants influencing traits like eye color, hair color, and racial ancestry, in order to complete a portrait.&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aldous|first1=Peter|title=Artwork highlights legal debate over 'abandoned' DNA|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23677-artworks-highlight-legal-debate-over-abandoned-dna.html#.U-N6YUi9g7A|accessdate=August 7, 2014|work=New Scientist|date=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the DNA strands are extracted from the samples, Dewey-Hagborg then amplifies, or copies, specific regions of the genome, using a technique called [[Polymerase Chain Reaction]], or PCR, a process advanced by [[Kary Mullis]], a winner of the [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry (1993).&lt;ref name="Dawsey, J"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt; These amplified regions of the genome make it possible to identifying [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]], or SNPs (pronounced "snips"),&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt; which contain variables in the base pairs that give clues to a person's individual genetic make up (e.g., whether or not a person's eyes might be blue, brown or green). These results are then sent for analysis to a company for sequencing. Dewey-Hagborg used [[23andMe]],&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt; a DNA analysis service, for ''Stranger Visions''.

The genetic blueprint&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gruber, B."/&gt; she receives in return is a text file full of coded information identifying the unique positioning of the 4 [[nucleobase]]s [[adenine]], [[thymine]], [[cytosine]], and [[guanine]], or ATC and G, that make up the sections of the genome she is interested in.&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt; This data is then entered into a customized computer program she wrote.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."/&gt; The program interprets the code and provides her with a list of traits, including propensity for obesity, eye color, hair color, hair curl, skin tone, freckles, and gender.&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt; She then takes these traits, as many as 50, and enters them into a face-generating program to configure the 3-D portraits.&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt; Her previous experience with facial recognition algorithms gave her the ability to repurpose an existing [[facial recognition system|facial recognition program]], from [[Basel]], Switzerland.&lt;ref name="Walters, H."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walters|first1=Helen|title=A Portrait from a Single Hair: The Work of Heather-Dewey Hagborg|url=http://ideas.ted.com/2013/06/20/generating-a-sculpture-from-a-hair-the-work-of-heather-dewey-hagborg/|website=Ideas.Ted.Com|accessdate=August 7, 2014|date=June 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reworked the program to generate faces instead of just recognizing facial features.&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; The resulting model changes facial dimensions (e.g., width of the nose and mouth) and characteristics with the genetic information it receives. Before making the final 3-D print,&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt; Dewey-Hagborg generates several different versions of the face, finally choosing the one she finds most aesthetically pleasing.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Kurt|title=Making Portraits out of DNA|url=http://www.studio360.org/story/267842-making-portraits-out-of-dna|website=Studio 360|accessdate=August 7, 2014|date=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of Dewey-Hagborg's ''Stranger Visions'' question whether or not the work crosses ethical and legal boundaries.&lt;ref name="Aldous, Peter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aldous|first1=Peter|title=Who's looking through your discarded DNA?|journal=New Scientist|date=2013-06-15|volume=281|issue=2921|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They make a distinction between an artist's right to express societal concerns through artwork and the act of collecting personal, genetic information without informed consent.&lt;ref name="Gruber, B."/&gt; The fact that DNA samples are regularly "left behind" or abandoned does not mean those people have relinquished their interest in how that information is used.&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."/&gt;&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt;

Some laws, like that of the [[Human Tissue Act of 2004]] in the United Kingdom, prohibit private individuals from collecting biological samples for DNA analysis.&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt; What laws that exist to regulate the collection and use of DNA samples in the United States are not consistent among the states and rarely address the private sector.&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt; Only some states, like New York, outlaw most DNA testing without written consent.&lt;ref name="Aldous, Peter"/&gt; Others worry about the misuse of the information, fearing discrimination based on existing medical or mental health issues or a predisposition for disease-related illnesses or "unreasonable" searches of DNA evidence by law enforcement.&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt;&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Enserink, M."&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Enserink|first1=Martin|title=Emerging Forensics Field May Hit Legal and Ethical Obstacles|journal=Science|date=February 18, 2011|volume=331|doi=10.1126/science.331.6019.840|pages=840|pmid=21330505}}&lt;!--|accessdate=August 7, 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One scientist and one gallery, according to Dewey-Hagborg, turned down her proposal fearing the project would "cause a fright" among people.&lt;ref name="Dawsey, J"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wang, L."/&gt;

Other critics focus on the growing do-it-yourself or [[Do-it-yourself biology|biohacking]] movement. Supporters like Genspace's Ellen Jorgensen claim projects like ''Stranger Visions'' engage the public and make the new technology more accessible.&lt;ref name="Krulwich, R."/&gt; Detractors fear unintended or unexpected consequences from unregulated experiments conducted by D.I.Y. amateur biologists developed in non-traditional laboratory settings.&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aldous, P."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt;

Still others, including Daniel MacArthur, an assistant professor at [[Harvard Medical School]], [[John D. Hawks]], an anthropologist at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]], Michelle N. Meyer, an academic fellow at the Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology &amp; Bioethics at Harvard Medical School, and [[Arthur Caplan]], PhD, Director of the Division of Medical Ethics, N.Y.U., report that the technological capability to construct an accurate likeness of a human face based on DNA evidence is not currently available.&lt;ref name="Herper, M."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt;

Although it is possible to identify certain genetic markers linked to facial structures, scientists have yet to isolate all the genes and their variations needed to produce an accurate likeness with a computer simulation.&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt; Meyer, who analyzed the data from Dewey-Hagborg's website concludes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So far as I can tell, she's working with sex; ancestral groups that are usually very broad, and in any event only reflects half of the individual's DNA (from which she presumably guesses hair color and texture and bone structure); and a decent guess at eye color. There are hundreds of thousands (at least) of people who would fit these descriptions even if each of her phenotype predictions were accurate, and in many cases, one or more of the predictions are probably going to be wrong.&lt;ref name="Herper, M."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name=Passarello/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The environment, the probabilistic nature of interpreting the DNA data collected, and limitations of computer technology all influence the outcome.&lt;ref name="Wilson Center"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; She likens her work to that of a sketch artist.&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt; At most, her portraits bear only a vague, family resemblance to the people whose genetic information was used as a foundation for the portraits.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersen, K."/&gt;

===''A Becoming Resemblance''===
In the summer of 2017 Dewey-Hagborg's collaborative exhibition with transgender activist [[Chelsea E. Manning]] opened at Fridman Gallery. The exhibition was an iteration of the artist's successful and controversial ''Stranger Visions'' project.&lt;ref name="Kobler, J."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kobler|first1=Jason|title=Don't Give Your DNA to Giant Genetic Databases|work=Vice|date=May 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of ''A Becoming Resemblance'', Dewey-Hagborg created a series titled ''Radical Love'', 30 3-D printed portraits of Manning, based on cheek swabs and hair clippings that Manning sent her while incarcerated for leaking classified information to WikiLeaks. While all 30 portraits were based on Manning's DNA, their variances in skin color and features presents the malleability of DNA data. The installation demonstrated how much the human genome is up for interpretation once condensed and subjectively interpreted.

In 2013, Dewey-Hagborg was contacted by an assistant medical examiner in Delaware,&lt;ref name="Dawsey, J"/&gt; as a result of her work with ''Stranger Visions''. The project involved developing a portrait of an unidentified woman whose case has remained unsolved for 20 years. She agreed to be an adviser to assist with the case.&lt;ref name="Colanduno, D."/&gt; Though the resulting portrait based on the unidentified woman's DNA could only be as accurate as existing technology allowed, leaving room for speculation, Dewey-Hagborg viewed working on the case as the only potential use for this type of face-generating technology.&lt;ref name="Squires, A."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herper, M."/&gt; "If you can add anything at all to her description, if you can increase the possibility her loved ones may find her even one little bit I think it's worth it."&lt;ref name="Herper, M."/&gt; Critics of Dewey-Hagborg's involvement in the Delaware case express concern for what they call "D.I.Y. forensic science" and question the role of civilians in state investigations.&lt;ref name="Pauwels, E."/&gt;

Dewey-Hagborg's work with ''Stranger Visions'' and interest in issues surrounding genetic surveillance lead to the development of two products whose purpose is to eliminate DNA traces. The first, ''Erase'', is a bleaching spray that cleans surfaces (e.g., cups, silverware) of DNA evidence. The second, ''Replace'', is a spray consisting of a blend of genes designed to introduce foreign DNA evidence to the surface, therefore masking any of the original DNA remaining in that area.&lt;ref name="Brodwin, E."/&gt; Dewey-Hagborg views these as a "citizens' defense against the looming DNA surveillance state."&lt;ref name="Hartnett, K."&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hartnett|first1=Kevin|title=How to cover your DNA trail|work=Boston Globe|date=May 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1931">The '''Hubble European Space Agency Information Centre''' ('''HEIC''') is a science communication office, established at the [[Space Telescope - European Coordinating Facility]] (ST-ECF) in [[Munich]], [[Germany]] late in 1999. This initiative was taken so as to fulfil the NASA/ESA [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) outreach and education tasks for the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA), as outlined in an agreement between [[NASA]] and [[ESA]].

Over the past few years HEIC has become a very distinguished communication office of experts using the newest software and techniques. The European Hubble office has produced large amounts of astronomical material suitable both for educational purposes and wider public consumption. HEIC provides a well-assorted archive that is publicly available on its web page.

The work is centred on the production of news and photo releases that highlight interesting Hubble science results and images. These are often European in origin, and so not only increase the awareness of ESA’s Hubble share (15%), but the contribution of European scientists to the observatory. Furthermore, the group produces video releases, innovative educational material, CD-ROMs, brochures, posters, as well as DVDs and museum information kiosks, and much more.

The Hubble Information Centre is headed by the science communication specialist [[Lars Lindberg Christensen]] and the lead graphic designer is [[Martin Kornmesser]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6334">'''Humanities in the United States''' refers to the study of [[humanities]] disciplines, such as literature, history, language, performing and visual arts or philosophy, in the [[United States|United States of America]].

Many American colleges and universities seek to provide a broad "[[liberal arts education]]", in which all [[college]] students to study the humanities in addition to their specific area of study. Prominent proponents of liberal arts in the United States have included [[Mortimer J. Adler]]&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Mortimer J.; "A Guidebook to Learning: For the Lifelong Pursuit of Wisdom"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[E.D. Hirsch]].  A liberal arts focus is often coupled with curricular requirements; colleges including [[Saint Anselm College]] and [[Providence College]] have mandatory two-year [[core curricula]] in the humanities for their students.

The 1980 United States Rockefeller Commission on the Humanities described the humanities in its report, ''The Humanities in American Life'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Through the humanities we reflect on the fundamental question: What does it mean to be human? The humanities offer clues but never a complete answer. They reveal how people have tried to make moral, spiritual, and intellectual sense of a world in which irrationality, despair, loneliness, and death are as conspicuous as birth, friendship, hope, and reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Conceptual validity==
The very concept of the ‘humanities’ as a  class or kind, distinct from the ’sciences’, has come under repeated attack in the twentieth century. [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|T.S. Kuhn]]’s ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Samuel Kuhn|Kuhn, Thomas]], ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', The [[University of Chicago Press]], 1962&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the forces driving scientific progress often have less to do with objective inference from unbiased observation than with much more value-laden sociological and cultural factors. More recently, [[Richard Rorty]] has argued that the distinction between the sciences and the humanities is harmful to both pursuits, placing the former on an undeserved pedestal and condemning the latter to irrationality. Rorty’s position requires a wholesale rejection of such traditional philosophical distinctions as those between appearance and reality, subjective and objective, replacing them with what he endorses as a new ‘fuzziness’. This leads to a kind of pragmatism where "the oppositions between the humanities, the arts, and the sciences, might gradually fade away... In this situation, ‘the humanities’ would no longer think of themselves as such...."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Rorty|Rorty, Richard]], ''Science as Solidarity'', in ''Objectivity, Relativism and Truth: Philosophical Papers Volume I'', [[Cambridge University Press]], 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernism and postmodernism==
In the United States, the late 20th century saw a challenge to the "elitism" of the humanities, which [[Edward Said]] has characterized as a "conservative philosophy of gentlemanly refinement, or sensibility." Such [[postmodernism|postmodernists]] argued that the humanities should go beyond the study of "[[dead white males]]" to include work by women and people of color, and without religious bias. The French philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] has been a very influential part of this movement, stating in ''The Order of Things'' that "we can study only individuals, not human nature."  However some in the humanities believed that such changes could be detrimental; the result is said to be what [[E. D. Hirsch Jr.]] refers to as declining [[cultural literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Kernan, Alvin, editor; ''What's Happened to the Humanities?'', [[Princeton University Press]], Princeton, New Jersey, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

==National institutions==
President [[Lyndon Johnson]] signed the [[National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act]] in 1965,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/overview.html www.neh.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; creating the National Council on the Humanities, and funded the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH) in 1969. NEH is an independent grant-making agency of the United States government dedicated to supporting research, education, preservation, and public programs in the humanities (see [[Public humanities]]).

NEH facilitated the creation of State Humanities Councils&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/statecouncils.html www.neh.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; in the 56 [[U.S. state]]s and [[Territories of the United States|territories]]. Each council operates independently, defining the "humanities" in relationship to the disciplines, subjects, and values valued in the regions they serve. Councils give grant funds to individuals, scholars, and nonprofit organizations dedicated to the humanities in their region. Councils also offer diverse programs and services that respond to the needs of their communities and according to their own definitions of the humanities.

==Career prospects==
Criticism of the traditional humanities/liberal arts degree program has been leveled by critics who see them as both expensive and relatively "useless" in the modern American job market, where several years of specialized study is required in most job fields. According to a 2018 report by the [[Humanities Indicators]], unemployment rates for humanities majors were slightly higher and their earnings were slightly lower than the averages for college degree recipients with similar degree levels (though both were still substantially better than for those without a college degree). Their overall levels of satisfaction with their jobs and their lives, however, were essentially the same as graduates from other fields, with more than 85% of humanities graduates reporting they were satisfied with their jobs. As of 2015, approximately five million people employed in management and professional jobs had bachelor’s degrees in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The State of the Humanities 2018: Graduates in the Workforce &amp; Beyond|last=|first=|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|year=2018|isbn=|location=Cambridge, Mass.|pages=5-6, 12, 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Durham University's extragalactic astronomy group was founded in the late 1970s, and secured in 1984-5 with the appointments of [[Carlos Frenk]], [[Richard Ellis (astronomer)|Richard Ellis]], and Tom Shanks. A group researching theoretical cosmology grew steadily during the 1980s and 1990s, mainly funded by the UK [[Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council]] (PPARC). A dedicated building for theoretical cosmology was then funded through private donations, principally from alumnus [[Peter Ogden]], and opened in 2002 by the Prime Minister, [[Tony Blair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Barrat|first=Peter|title=Prime Minister Tony Blair Opens New Centre for Physics Research|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=9567|publisher=PPARC|date=18 October 2002 | accessdate = 6 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has grown in these new facilities, and the ICC now hosts more than 60 researchers, including theoretical and observational cosmologists, as well as astroparticle physicists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = ICC Personnel | url = http://icc.dur.ac.uk/index.php?content=Staff/Staff | accessdate = 6 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the ICC is strictly speaking a theoretical institute, theory and observations in cosmology are intimately interwoven. Uniquely amongst Durham University's Research Institutes, the ICC and IPPP are structurally integrated within an academic and teaching department, [[Durham University Department of Physics|Physics]]. The physics department as a whole was awarded grade 5A in the 2001 [[Research Assessment Exercise]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Research Assessment Exercise 2001 | publisher = Higher Education Funding Council for England | url = http://www.rae.ac.uk/2001/ | accessdate = 6 September 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131003145917/http://www.rae.ac.uk/2001/ | archivedate = 3 October 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; (RAE) carried out by the UK government, with the international excellence of research in Astronomy and Particle Physics specifically highlighted. The department's research in Space Science and Astrophysics was rated as number one in Europe and fourth in the world by Thomson Reuters from its Essential Science Indicators (1998–2008).&lt;ref&gt;

'''Latent homosexuality''' is an [[erotic]] attraction toward members of the same sex that is not [[conscious]]ly experienced or expressed in overt action. This may mean a [[closeted|hidden]] inclination or potential for [[bi-curious|interest]] in [[homosexual]] relationships, which is either suppressed or not recognized, and which has not yet been explored, or may never be explored.

The term was originally proposed by [[Sigmund Freud]]. Some argue that the latent homosexuality is a potentially [[iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] effect (that is, it is not present until suggested by a therapist).{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}  Others argue that the term ''latent'' is not truly applicable in the case of homosexual urges, since they are often not in the unconscious or unexpressed category, but rather exist in the conscious mind and are (often violently) [[Psychological repression|repressed]] on a conscious level.

==Links to homophobia==
A [[theory]] that [[homophobia]] is a result of latent homosexuality was put forth in the late 20th century. A 1996 study conducted at the [[University of Georgia]] by Henry Adams, Lester Wright Jr., and Bethany Lohr&lt;ref name=homophobiastudy&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://my.psychologytoday.com/files/u47/Henry_et_al.pdf|pmid=8772014|year=1996|last1=Adams|first1=HE|last2=Wright Jr|first2=LW|last3=Lohr|first3=BA|title=Is homophobia associated with homosexual arousal?|volume=105|issue=3|pages=440–5|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|doi=10.1037/0021-843X.105.3.440}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that a number of homophobic males exhibit latent homosexuality. The research was done on 64 heterosexual men, 35 of whom exhibited homophobic traits and 29 who did not. They were assigned to groups on the basis of their scores on the Index of Homophobia (W. W. Hudson &amp; W. A. Ricketts, 1980). The groups did not differ in aggression.&lt;ref name=homophobiastudy /&gt;

Three tests were conducted using [[penile plethysmography]]. While there was no difference in response when the men were exposed to [[heterosexual]] and [[lesbian]] [[pornography]], there was a major difference in response when the men were exposed to male homosexual pornography.

The researchers reported that 24% of the non-homophobic men showed some degree of [[tumescence]] in response to the male homosexual video, compared to 54% of the subjects who scored high on the homophobia scale. In addition, 66% of the non-homophobic group showed no significant increases in [[tumescence]] after this video, but only 20% of the homophobic men failed to display any arousal. Additionally, when the participants rated their degree of sexual arousal later, the homophobic men significantly underestimated their degree of arousal by the male homosexual video.

The results of this study indicate that individuals who score in the homophobic range and admit negative affect toward homosexuality demonstrate significant sexual arousal to male homosexual erotic stimuli.

A possible explanation is found in various psychoanalytic theories, which have generally explained homophobia as a threat to an individual's own homosexual impulses causing repression, denial, or reaction formation (or all three; West, 1977). Generally, these varied explanations conceive of homophobia as one type of latent homosexuality where persons either are unaware of or deny their homosexual urges.&lt;ref name=homophobiastudy /&gt;

Another explanation of these data is found in Barlow, Sakheim, and Beck's (1983) theory of the role of anxiety and attention in sexual responding. It is possible that viewing homosexual stimuli causes negative emotions such as anxiety in homophobic men but not in nonhomophobic men. Because anxiety has been shown to enhance arousal and erection, this theory would predict increases in erection in homophobic men.&lt;ref name=homophobiastudy /&gt;

[[Reparative therapy]] advocates {{who|date=May 2013}} disagree that the homophobic males were stimulated by genuine latent homosexuality, claiming that the stimulation arose from negative emotions such as anxiety.

==Links to environment==
Living in a homophobic [[culture]], not being exposed to homosexuality, and being surrounded by members of both genders may encourage latent homosexuality.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} Conversely, [[Situational sexual behavior|situational homosexuality]] may be due to exposure to a single-gender environment, such as a [[single-sex education|single-sex school]], prison, or military service.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==In fiction==
In [[Kingsley Amis]]' 1966 book, ''[[The Anti-Death League]]'' the main character is introduced while resisting treatment for repressed homosexuality – which a doctor believes that he has – despite the man being openly homosexual.

Latent homosexual themes were a common theme of science fiction films of the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Geraghty2009"&gt;{{cite book |author=Lincoln Geraghty |title=American Science Fiction Film and Television |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WkILrUVObWQC&amp;pg=PT23 |date=1 October 2009 |publisher=[[Berg Publishers|Berg]] |isbn=978-0-85785-076-8 |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1999 film ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' the character Colonel Fitts ([[Chris Cooper]]) is depicted as being a latent homosexual. Throughout the film, Fitts makes several statements that are narrow-minded and [[homophobic]], and it disturbs the colonel that his son Ricky might be homosexual. However, towards the end of the film, it is revealed that Fitts himself has sexual feelings towards men when he approaches his neighbor Lester Burnham ([[Kevin Spacey]]) and kisses him, but Lester rejects Col.&amp;nbsp;Fitts, and this greatly humiliates him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0169547/?ref_=fn_tt_tt_1 |series=film title |title=American Beauty |website=IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=June 2007}}
A '''legal case''' is a dispute between opposing parties resolved by a [[court]], or by some equivalent legal process. A legal case may be either [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] or [[criminal law]]. In each legal case there is an [[Plaintiff|accuser]] and one or more [[defendant]]s.

==Civil case==
A civil case, more commonly known as a [[lawsuit]] or [[Controversy (law)|controversy]], begins when a [[plaintiff]] [[file (legal)|files]] a document called a [[complaint]] with a court, informing the court of the wrong that the plaintiff has allegedly suffered because of the [[defendant]], and requesting a [[judicial remedy|remedy]]. The remedy sought may be money, an [[injunction]], which requires the defendant to perform or refrain from performing some action, or a [[declaratory judgment]], which determines that the plaintiff has certain legal rights. The remedy will be prescribed by the court if the plaintiff wins the case. A civil case can also be arbitrated through [[arbitration]], which may result in a faster settlement, with lower costs, than could be obtained by going through a trial. 

The plaintiff must make a genuine effort to inform the defendant of the case through [[service of process]], by which the plaintiff delivers to the defendant the same documents that the plaintiff filed with the court.

At any point during the case, the parties can agree to a [[settlement (law)|settlement]], which will end the case, although in some circumstances, such as in [[class action]]s, a settlement requires court approval in order to be binding.

===Family case===
Cases involving separation including asset division, support (a.k.a. maintenance or alimony), and matters related to children are handled differently in different jurisdictions. Often, the court's procedure for dealing with family cases is very similar to that of a civil case (it requires service and disclosure, and will issue judgments).

Divorce and separation from a spouse is one of the most stressful situations, as rated by the [[Holmes and Rahe stress scale#Adults|Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale]], and so family proceedings are increasingly being "divorced" from the often very formal and impersonal process of civil proceedings, and given special treatment.

==Criminal case==
{{Main article|Criminal case}}
[[File:CanadianCriminalCases.jpg|thumb|Canadian criminal cases]]
A [[criminal case]], in [[common law (legal system)|common law]] jurisdictions, begins when a person suspected of a crime is [[indictment|indicted]] by a grand jury or otherwise charged with the offense by a government official called a [[prosecutor]] or [[district attorney]].

A criminal case may in some jurisdictions be settled before a [[Trial (law)|trial]] through a [[plea bargain]]. Typically, in a plea bargain, the defendant agrees to plead guilty to a lesser charge than that which was originally brought by the grand jury or prosecuter. A defendant who goes to trial risks greater penalties than would normally be imposed through a plea bargain.

==Common elements==
Legal cases, whether criminal or civil, are premised on the idea that a dispute will be fairly resolved when a [[legal procedure]] exists by which the dispute can be brought to a factfinder not otherwise involved in the case, who can evaluate [[evidence (law)|evidence]] to determine the truth with respect to claims of guilt, innocence, liability, or lack of fault. Details of the procedure may depend on both the kind of case and the kind of system in which the case is brought - whether, for example, it is an [[inquisitorial system]] or a solo

===Designation and citation===
&lt;!--Linked from [[Tochigi patricide case]]--&gt;
{{main|Case citation}}
In most systems, the governing body responsible for overseeing the courts assigns a unique number/letter combination or similar designation to each case in order to track the various disputes that are or have been before it. The outcome of the case is recorded, and can later be reviewed by obtaining a copy of the documents associated with the designation previously assigned to the case.

However, it is often more convenient to refer to cases{{spaced ndash}}particularly landmark and other notable cases{{spaced ndash}}by a title of the form ''Claimant [[wikt:v.|v]] Defendant'' (e.g. ''[[Arkell v Pressdram]]'').  Where a legal proceeding does not have formally designated adverse parties, a form such as ''[[In re]]'', ''Re'' or ''In the matter of'' is used (e.g. ''[[In re Gault]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford University Standard for Citation of Legal Authorities |url=http://www.law.ox.ac.uk/publications/oscola.php |publisher=Hart Publishers |edition=4 |year=2012 |isbn=9781849463676}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "v" separating the parties is an abbreviation of the Latin [[wikt:versus|versus]], but, when spoken in [[Commonwealth countries]], it is normally rendered as "[[wikt:and|and]]" or "[[wikt:against|against]]" (as in, for example, [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Jarndyce and Jarndyce]]'').  Where it is considered necessary to protect the anonymity of a [[natural person]], some cases may have one or both parties replaced by a standard pseudonym ([[John Doe|Jane Roe]] in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'') or by an initial (''[[D v D]]'').  In titles such as ''[[R v Adams]]'', however, the initial "R" is usually an abbreviation for the Latin [[King|Rex]] or [[Queen regnant|Regina]], i.e. for [[the Crown]]. (For an explanation of other terms that may appear in case titles, see the [[Glossary of legal terms]].)

The '''Marine Biological Laboratory''' ('''MBL''') is an international center for research and education in biological and environmental science. Founded in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]], in 1888, the MBL is a private, nonprofit institution affiliated with the [[University of Chicago]]. After being independent for most of its history, it became affiliated with the university on July 1, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/uc-affiliation/|title=Affiliation with University of Chicago|website=Affiliation with University of Chicago|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/mbl-uchicago-faq/|title=MBL – University of Chicago Affiliation FAQ|website=www.mbl.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also collaborates with numerous other institutions.

== Introduction ==
The MBL has approximately 250 year-round employees, about half of which are scientists and scientific support staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/mbl-facts/|title=About the MBL|website=www.mbl.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are joined each year by more than 500 visiting scientists, summer staff, and research associates from hundreds of institutions around the world, as well as a large number of faculty and students participating in MBL courses (in 2016, 550 students from  333 institutions and 58 countries).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

The MBL's resident research centers are the Eugene Bell Center for Regenerative Biology and Tissue Engineering, the Ecosystems Center, and the Bay Paul Center for Comparative Molecular Biology and Evolution. Visiting scientists are affiliated with the MBL's Whitman Center. Other resources include The Marine Resources Center, an advanced facility for maintaining, culturing, and providing aquatic and marine organisms essential to biological, biomedical, and ecological research; and The National Xenopus Resource, which breeds and maintains Xenopus (frog) genetic stocks; and provides training in Xenopus husbandry, cell biology, imaging, genetics, transgenesis, and genomics.  

Research at the MBL focuses on four themes:

* fundamental biological research, often using marine organisms as novel model systems, encompassing research in regenerative biology, neuroscience, sensory physiology, and comparative evolution and genomics;
* the study of microbiomes and microbial diversity and ecology in a variety of ocean and terrestrial habitats;
* imaging and computation;
* ecosystems science and climate change, and organismal adaptation to changing environments.

The MBL offers a range of courses, workshops, conferences, and internships throughout the year. Central to its programs are more than 20 Advanced Research Training Courses, graduate-level courses in topics ranging from physiology, embryology, neurobiology, and microbiology to imaging and computation integrated with biological research. In addition, the MBL hosts courses for undergraduate and graduate students from the University of Chicago and other colleges and universities, as well as workshops and conferences—accommodating more than 2,600 participants in 2016. (MBL Facts).

Among the scientists with a significant affiliation with the MBL (scientists, course faculty and students) are 57 Nobel Prize winners (since 1929); 124 Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigators, early career scientists, international researchers, and professors (since 1960); 263 Members of the National Academy of Sciences (since 1960); and 219 Members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (since 1960). 

The MBL shares a library, the MBLWHOI Library, with [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]]. The MBLWHOI Library holds print and electronic collections in the biological, biomedical, ecological, and oceanographic sciences, and houses a growing archival collection, including photograph and videos from the MBL's 120-year history. The library also conducts digitization and informatics projects.

In September 2018, Nipam Patel became director of the Marine Biological Laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/blog/introducing-nipam-patel-director-marine-biological-laboratory/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2017, Neil Shubin, Ph.D., and Melina Hale, Ph.D., were named interim co-directors of the Marine Biological Laboratory, succeeding [[Huntington F. Willard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/blog/uchicago-faculty-members-to-serve-on-marine-biological-laboratory-interim-leadership-team/|title=UChicago Faculty Members to Serve on MBL Interim Leadership Team|author=|date=|website=www.mbl.edu|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Marine Biological Laboratory grew from the vision of several Bostonians and [[Spencer Fullerton Baird]], the United State's first Fish Commissioner (a government official concerned with the use of [[fisheries]]). Baird had set up a [[United States Fish Commission]] research station in Woods Hole in 1882, and had ambitions to expand it into a major laboratory. He invited [[Alpheus Hyatt]] to move his marine biology laboratory and school which he had founded at the [[Norwood-Hyatt House]] in [[Annisquam, Massachusetts]], to Woods Hole. Inspired by Harvard biologist [[Louis Agassiz]]'s short-lived summer school of natural history on Penikese Island, off the coast of Woods Hole, Hyatt accepted the offer. With $10,000 raised by the Woman's Education Association of Boston and the [[Boston Society of Natural History]], land was purchased, a building was erected, and the MBL was incorporated with Hyatt as the first president of the board of trustees. The Fish Commission supplied crucial support, including marine organisms and running sea water.

[[Charles Otis Whitman]], an embryologist, was retained as the first director of the MBL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/charles-otis-whitman-1842-1910|title=Charles Otis Whitman (1842-1910) {{!}} The Embryo Project Encyclopedia|website=embryo.asu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitman, who believed “other things being equal, the investigator is always the best instructor,” emphasized the need to combine research and education at the new laboratory. The MBL's first summer course provided a six-week introduction to invertebrate zoology; facilities for visiting summer investigators were also offered.

The MBL Library was established in 1889, with scientist and future MBL trustee [[Cornelia Clapp]] serving as librarian. In 1899, the MBL began publishing ''[[The Biological Bulletin]]'', a scientific journal that is still edited at the MBL.

[[Gertrude Stein]], later well known as a novelist and art collector, took part in MBL's Embryology course in the summer of 1897, while her brother Leo took part in the Invertebrates course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://comm.archive.mbl.edu/publications/women_stein.html |title=Women of Science, Gertrude Stein (1874-1946) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Inside the MBL |publisher= |access-date=August 2, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people= |date=1897 |title=Embryology Class 1897 |medium=Photograph |url=https://hpsrepository.asu.edu/handle/10776/12859 |access-date= |archive-url= |location=Woods Hole, Massachusetts |publisher=Marine Biological Laboratory Archives |quote=1897 Embryology Class, six women sitting in front row, two rows of men standing behind them, many with hats on, most looking at camera.

The MBL formally affiliated with the [[University of Chicago]] on July 1, 2013. In order to further scientific research and education, the affiliation builds on historical ties with the university, as MBL was led by University of Chicago faculty members in its first four decades.  The president of the university chairs the MBL trustee's board and with their advice appoints its members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/uc-affiliation/2013/11/27/university-of-chicago-president-robert-j-zimmer-to-serve-as-chairman-of-marine-biological-laboratory-board-of-trustees-2/|title=University of Chicago President Robert J.

== Research History ==
=== Cell, developmental, and reproductive biology ===
Cell, developmental, and reproductive biology have been a central part of the MBL's programs since the 1890s. Important discoveries in these fields at the MBL reach back to 1899, when [[Jacques Loeb]] demonstrated artificial parthenogenesis in sea urchin eggs; to 1905, when [[Edwin Grant Conklin]] first identified egg cytoplasmic regions that are programmed to form certain tissues or organs; to 1916, when [[Frank Rattray Lillie]] identified circulating hormones that influence sexual differentiation (Lillie, 1944). In the MBL's first two decades, cytologists [[Edmund Beecher Wilson]], [[Nettie Stevens]] and others made connections between the chromosomes and Mendelian heredity, while Wilson's colleague at both the MBL and Columbia University, [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], launched the field of experimental genetics (Pauly, 2000:158). [[Keith R. Porter]], considered by many to be a founder of modern cell biology due to his pioneering work on the fine structure of cells, including the discovery of [[microtubules]], carried out research at the MBL starting in 1937 and directed the laboratory from 1975-77 (Barlow et al., 1993: 95-115).

The MBL is also a proving ground for new technologies in [[microscopy]] and imaging. The availability of cutting-edge imaging instrumentation in the MBL's Advanced Research Courses puts faculty and students at the forefront of experimentation. MBL Distinguished Scientist [[Osamu Shimomura]], who joined the MBL in 1983, was awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery of [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) in the early 1960s, which led to the development of revolutionary techniques for imaging live cells and their components. Resident Distinguished Scientist Shinya Inoué's innovations in polarized light microscopy and video imaging since the 1950s have been instrumental in clarifying the cellular events of [[mitosis]], including his discovery of the [[spindle fibers]].

The MBL has long been a center for the world's experts in cell division. In the early 1980s, [[Tim Hunt]], Joan Ruderman and others at the MBL identified the first of a class of proteins that regulate the cycle of cell division ([[cyclin]]). Hunt was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2001 for this work (Hunt, 2004). In 1984, [[Ron Vale]], Michael Sheetz, and others discovered [[kinesin]], a motor protein involved in mitosis and other cellular processes, during summer MBL research. Vale, Sheetz, and James Spudich received the 2012 Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research for their discoveries related to molecular motors. In 1991 Israeli scientist [[Avram Hershko]] began coming to the MBL to study the role that the protein ubiquitin plays in cell division. In 2004, Hershko won a Nobel Prize for his work to establish the basic mechanism of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation.

A large portion of the leading developmental biologists in the United States, both historically and today, have participated in the MBL's Embryology Course as directors, lecturers or students. One draw is the Woods Hole location and the availability of marine organisms, particularly the [[sea urchin]], that are ideal for embryological analysis because they shed nearly transparent eggs which are fertilized and develop externally. In the first decades after the course was founded in 1893, its faculty pioneered research directions that remain central today, including the study of cytoplasmic localization in eggs; embryonic cell lineage (important in modern [[stem cell]] research); and [[evolutionary developmental biology]] (today called ‘evo devo'). Some distinguished embryologists who have directed the course are [[Charles Otis Whitman]] (1893–1895); [[Frank Rattray Lillie]] (1896–1903); Viktor Hamburger (1942–45); James Ebert (1962–66); [[Eric H. Davidson]] (1972–74; 1988–96); Rudolf Raff (1980–82) (see Davidson, 1993) and  Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado and Richard Behringer (2012-2016).

=== Regenerative biology and medicine ===
In 2010, the MBL established the Eugene Bell Center for Regenerative Biology and Tissue Engineering, where researchers study the ability of marine and other animals to spontaneously regenerate damaged or aging body parts. An understanding of tissue and organ regeneration in lower animals holds promise for translation to treatments for human conditions, including spinal cord injury, diabetes, organ failure, and degenerative neural diseases such as Alzheimer's.  A cornerstone of the Bell Center is a national resource for research on the frog, Xenopus, which is a major animal model used in U.S. biomedical research. The National Xenopus Resource at the MBL is funded by the National Institutes of Health (MBL Facts).

=== Neuroscience, neurobiology, and sensory physiology ===
The MBL's contributions to [[neuroscience]] and sensory physiology are significant, fostered today by more than 65 visiting investigators and resident researchers in these fields, as well as five graduate- and post-graduate level Advanced Research Training courses. The MBL has been a magnet for the discipline since L.W. Williams in 1910 discovered, and [[John Zachary Young]] in 1936 rediscovered, the [[squid giant axon]], a nerve fiber that is 20 times larger in diameter than the largest human axon. Young brought this locally abundant, ideal experimental system to the attention of his MBL colleague [[Kenneth Stewart Cole|KS Cole]], who in 1938 used it to record the resistance changes underlying the action potential, which provided evidence that ions flowing across the axonal membrane generate this electrical impulse. In 1938, [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] came to the MBL to learn about the squid giant axon from Cole. After World War II, Hodgkin and [[Andrew Huxley]], working in Plymouth, England and using the [[voltage clamp]] technique developed by Cole, laid the basis for the modern understanding of electrical activity in the nervous system by measuring quantitatively the flow of ions across the axonal membrane. Hodgkin and Huxley received the Nobel Prize in 1963 for their description of the ionic basis of nerve conduction (Barlow et al., 1993: 151-172). Following on Hodgkin and Huxley's work, in the 1960s and 1970s [[Clay Armstrong]] and other MBL researchers described a number of the properties of the [[ion channels]] that allow sodium and potassium ions to carry electric current across the cell membrane and [[Rodolfo Llinas]] described the transmission properties at the squid giant synapse (Llinas 1999). The “scientific career” of the “Woods Hole squid,” ''[[Doryteuthis pealeii|Doryteuthis (formerly Loligo) pealeii]]'', continues today, with studies on [[axonal transport]], the [[squid giant synapse]], squid genomics, and the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease.

Other marine organisms draw neuroscientists and neurobiologists to the MBL each summer, where a history of research into sensory physiology and behavior has been established. [[Haldan Keffer Hartline]], an MBL summer investigator in the 1920s and early 1930s, uncovered several basic mechanisms of photoreceptor function through his studies on the horseshoe crab. Hartline shared the 1967 Nobel Prize with summer MBL colleague [[George Wald]], who described the molecular basis of photoreception by showing that the light-sensitive visual pigment molecules consist of a slightly modified form of vitamin A coupled to a protein.  Another long-term summer investigator, [[Stephen W. Kuffler]], is credited with “founding” the science of [[neurobiology]] in the mid-1960s at Harvard Medical School and he also initiated instruction in neurobiology at the MBL (Barlow et al., 1993:175-234; 203-234). [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] (Nobel Laureate in 1937) conducted research at the MBL from 1947 to 1986, most significantly on the biochemical nature of muscular contraction.  In the 1950s and 1960s, Frederik Bang and Jack Levin at the MBL discovered that the blood of the horseshoe crab clotted when exposed to bacterial endotoxins even in vanishingly small amounts. From this basic research, a reagent, Limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL), was developed that can detect minute amounts of bacterial toxins. The [[LAL test]] has resulted in dramatic improvement in the quality of drugs and biological products for intravenous injection.

=== Ecosystems science ===
Ecosystems research became a year-round commitment at the MBL in 1962 with the founding of the Systematics-Ecology program, under the direction of Melbourne R. Carriker. In 1975, the MBL's Ecosystems Center was established, with George Woodwell as director. The original research focus was on the global [[carbon cycle]], an emphasis maintained today. The Ecosystems Center has a year-round staff of more than 40 scientists who study a variety of ecosystems and their responses to human activities and environmental changes. The center is located in Woods Hole yet has a global reach, with active research sites in the Arctic tundra; in forest, coastal and marine sites in New England, Sweden and Brazil. The Ecosystems Center is home to two of the 26 U.S. Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) sites: Toolik Lake, Alaska; and Plum Island, Massachusetts. Scientists in the Ecosystems Center study the effects of forest clearance and land-use change on atmospheric chemistry, watershed processes and coastal ecology, the global-scale anthropogenic enrichment of the [[nitrogen cycle]], and ecosystem responses to [[global warming]]. The interim director of the Ecosystems Center is Anne Giblin. Former directors of the Center who are still active on the scientific staff are Jerry Melillo, who studies the [[biogeochemistry]] of terrestrial ecosystems, and John Hobbie, a microbial ecologist. The Ecosystems Center is founded on a vision of collaborative, interdisciplinary science; shared lab facilities and instrumentation; and a long-term, large-scale, systems-wide view of ecosystem processes.

=== Comparative genomics, molecular evolution, and microbial ecology ===
The Josephine Bay Paul Center for Comparative Molecular Biology and Evolution was founded at the MBL in 1997 and is currently directed by David Mark Welch. By comparing diverse [[genomes]], scientists at the center are elucidating the evolutionary relationships of biological systems, and describing genes and genomes of biomedical and environmental significance. [[Microorganisms]] found in a wide range of ecosystems, including the human [[microbiome]], are studied. [[Mitchell Sogin]], the Bay Paul Center's founder, also founded two courses at the MBL: the Workshop in Molecular Evolution; and Strategies and Techniques for Analyzing Microbial Population Structures. In 2003-2004, Sogin launched the International Census of Marine Microbes, a global effort to describe the [[biodiversity]] of marine micro-organisms. Early results from this census in 2006 revealed some 10 to 100 times more types of marine microbes than expected, and the vast majority are previously unknown, low-abundance microorganisms now called the “rare biosphere.” Other Bay Paul Center projects are focused on microbes that live in extreme environments, from [[hydrothermal vents]] to highly acidic ecosystems, which may lead to a better understanding of life that could exist on other planets. Activities at the Bay Paul Center are supported by advanced DNA sequencing and other genomics equipment at the center's Keck Ecological and Evolutionary Genetics Facility.

'''Mark Roland Wilson Jones''' (born 1956) is an architect and prominent architectural historian whose research covers varied aspects of classical architecture while concentrating on that of ancient Greece and Rome. He is best known for his work on the design of monumental buildings, especially the [[Pantheon, Rome]], and that of the Architectural orders in both Roman and Greek contexts. He is the author of two important books of classical architecture, and is currently a senior lecturer (associate professor) at the [[University of Bath]].

== Biography ==
Wilson Jones was educated at [[Queens' College, Cambridge]] (MA Cantab in architecture, RIBA Part 1) and the Polytechnic of Central London, now the [[University of Westminster]] (Diploma in architecture, RIBA Part 2, with distinction). The architecture department at PCL at the time benefited from inspirational young teachers including [[David Leatherbarrow]], [[Eric Parry]], [[Demetri Porphyrios]] and [[Robert Tavernor]]. Wilson Jones moved to Rome to take up tenure of the Rome Prize (the British Prix de Rome) in Architecture at the [[British School at Rome]] (1982–1984), with a project on the masterpiece of [[Baldassarre Peruzzi]], [[Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne]], and it was the process of understanding Peruzzi’s ideas about ancient design that led Wilson Jones to study ancient Roman practice in its own right. To further this research he was awarded a research contract with the Soprintendenza Archeologica di Roma (1984-5) at the instigation of the archeologist [[Lucos Cozza]].

While working as an architect for practices including Shepheard, Epstein and Hunter in London and Bruges Tozer in [[Bristol]], Wilson Jones published several articles on his discoveries about the [[Pantheon, Rome]], [[Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne]], the [[Tempietto]] and the [[Corinthian order]]. Having won research grants from the [[British Academy]] and the [[Leverhulme Trust]] he moved back to Rome in 1991, where he combined research with private practice and teaching at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]] and at American universities with programmes in Rome, along with fellowships in the United States. In 2000 he moved to the Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering, [[University of Bath]], where he has served as Director of CASA, and Director of Postgraduate Research. His research has received funding from bodies including the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council|AHRC]] and he held a research fellowship at the [[Canadian Centre for Architecture]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cca.qc.ca/fr/centre-d-etude/854-mark-wilson-jones-modernism-and-the-myth-of-origins |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053003/http://www.cca.qc.ca/fr/centre-d-etude/854-mark-wilson-jones-modernism-and-the-myth-of-origins |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson Jones is a registered architect. His professional practice and archaeological interests have sometimes intersected, as in the commission for a shelter at the site of [[Cosa]] north of Rome, and, also on the initiative of [[Elizabeth Fentress]], a masterplan for the site of [[Volubilis]] in Morocco for the [[World Monuments Fund]] (2001-2003). He  has been member of the Architecture and Planning Committee of the [[Bath Preservation Trust]] since 2001, and a Trustee since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bath-preservation-trust.org.uk/about-us/trustees/&lt;/ref&gt; He has served on the Faculty of Archaeology, History and Letters of the [[British School at Rome]] from 2006 to 2011, and in 2010 was elected corresponding member of the [[American Institute of Archaeology]].

He is married to Donatella Caramia professor of neurology at the University of Rome.

== Research ==
While the scholarly environment of much of Wilson Jones’s research is archaeological, it is characterized by an architectural approach. He is drawn to major unresolved issues, especially if much debated ever since the Renaissance, or even antiquity. His discoveries invite paradigm shifts with respect to the scholarly consensus. A case in point is his demonstration that the Romans designed the [[Corinthian order]] of columns not according to ratios based on the lower column diameter, as stipulated by [[Vitruvius]] and his Renaissance followers.  This had been argued by Claude Perrault in 1683, but he and subsequent authorities mistakenly held Roman design to be merely empirical. Wilson Jones proved, however, that while yet compatible with almost endless variation the Romans did in fact employ a system of simple arithmetical ratios (e.g. 1:1,1:2 and 6:5) to design and produce Corinthian columns. His synthetic vision of Roman design appeared as ''Principles of Roman Architecture'' (Yale University Press, 2000), the only book to have been awarded both the [[Banister Fletcher]] Prize by the RIBA together with the Authors’ Club of Great Britain and the Alice Davis Hitchcock Medallion by the [[Society of Architectural Historians of Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bath.ac.uk/ace/people/wilson-jones/&lt;/ref&gt;

An abiding subject of study and controversy has been the [[Pantheon, Rome]], which despite being one of the most famous icons of architectural history is arguably a flawed masterpiece. The theory of a compromised design, first published in 1987 together with Paul Davies and David Hemsoll, was further developed in the final pair of chapters in Principles of Roman Architecture. Although widely embraced, the ‘compromise hypothesis’ has been contested by [[Lothar Haselberger]], a fellow authority on ancient design. Wilson Jones has published further corroboration in the volume of essays, ''The Pantheon from Antiquity to the Present'' (Cambridge University Press, 2015). Two decades of research into the nature of the orders and the Greek temple and the orders have culminated in the book ''Origins of Classical Architecture: temples, orders and gifts to the gods in ancient Greece'' (Yale University Press, 2014).

The '''Land Surface Model (LSM)''' is a unidimensional computational model developed by ''Gordon Bonan'' that describes ecological processes joined in many [[ecosystem model]]s, hydrological processes found in hydrological models and flow of surface common in surface models using atmospheric models.

In this way, the model examines interactions especially biogeophysics (sensible and latent heat, momentum, albedo, emission of long waves) and biogeochemistry (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) of the land-atmosphere the effect of surface of the land in the climate and composition of the atmosphere.

This model has a simplified treatment of the surface flows that reproduce at the very least computational cost the essential characteristics of the important interactions of the land-atmosphere for climatic simulations.

As the types of surface vegetated for some species are several, have a standardization of types of covering being enclosed surfaces covered with water as lakes (amongst others); thus the model wheel for each point of independent form, with the same average of the atmospheric interactions. The model functions in a space grating that can vary of a point until global.

The centre operates multi-purpose offshore renewable energy test and demonstration facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Test &amp; Demonstration assets – Catapult|url = https://ore.catapult.org.uk/testing|website = ore.catapult.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to other centres, such as [[NREL]] in the US&lt;ref&gt;http://www.narec.co.uk {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216002837/http://www.narec.co.uk/ |date=16 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[National Centre for Renewable Energies (CENER)]] in Spain. The National Renewable Energy Centre is based in [[Blyth, Northumberland]].

==History==

Originally known as NaREC (New and Renewable Energy Centre), the centre was created in 2002 by [[One NorthEast]], the North East [[regional development agency]], as part of the ''Strategy for Success'' programme.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.strategyforsuccess.info/page/news/article.cfm?articleId=1400&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the organisation changed its name to Narec (National Renewable Energy Centre).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.companiesintheuk.co.uk/ltd/national-renewable-energy-centre|title=OFFSHORE RENEWABLE ENERGY CATAPULT|work=CompaniesInTheUK}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2014, the organisation merged with the Offshore Renewable Energy (ORE) Catapult to focus on the development and cost reduction of offshore wind, wave and tidal energy across the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ORE Catapult and Narec merge|url = http://renews.biz/64303/ore-catapult-narec-link-ships|website = reNEWS – Renewable Energy News|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Narec to merge with Glasgow’s Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult|url = http://www.thejournal.co.uk/business/business-news/narec-merge-glasgows-offshore-renewable-6917321|website = journallive|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation was originally involved in a wide range of technologies, including:
* Wind (onshore and offshore)
* Transmission and distribution
* Photovoltaics
* Oil and gas
* Marine renewables
* Fuel cells
* Microrenewables
* Biomass&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narec.co.uk/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216002837/http://www.narec.co.uk/|title=Welcome to NaREC|archivedate=16 February 2008|work=narec.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, due to UK government cutbacks, Narec closed, sold off or separated parts of the business. Now, Narec itself concentrates on testing blades and drive trains for marine renewables. Spin-off companies include:

'''Narec Distributed Energy''' – An organisation which deals with microrenewables, energy efficiency, low carbon transport and citywide energy planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narecde.co.uk|title=Narec Distributed Energy – National Renewable Energy Centre Group|work=Narec Distributed Energy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narec Distributed Energy is 100% owned by Narec.

'''Solar''' '''Capture Technologies''' – 8% owned by Narec, and 92% owned by the Swedish firm Absolicon. This organisation is focused on silicon photovoltaic cells.&lt;ref name="wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk/57f66c2d0af5abf81b3aeaaf94e518dc/compdetails|title=Failure Page|work=companieshouse.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.narecsolar.com|title=Solar Capture Technologies – Home – Solar Capture Technologies|work=Solar Capture Technologies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.absolicon.com/narec-solar-spun-out/|title=Narec Solar Spun Out|work=absolicon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Narec Capital''' – A financial organisation run by Narec and Ashberg Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nebusiness.co.uk/business-news/latest-business-news/2011/07/04/narec-capital-looking-to-raise-300m-of-funding-51140-28987729/|title=Narec Capital looking to raise £300m of funding|author=journallive Administrator|date=4 July 2011|work=journallive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Narec Capital Risk Solutions''' – Beyond its existence, there is very little information on what this organisation does.&lt;ref name="wck2.companieshouse.gov.uk"/&gt;

Following its merger with ORE Catapult, the National Renewable Energy Centre now focuses on helping to de-risk and accelerate the development and commercialisation of the offshore renewable energy industry in the UK.

==Closed facilities==

===Clothier High Voltage Laboratory===

The [[Henry William Clothier|Clothier]] Electrical Testing Laboratory was opened in 1970 by [[A. Reyrolle &amp; Company]]. Narec took over the facility in 2004, to use it to test the robustness of electrical infrastructure offshore locations to onshore sites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nebusiness.co.uk/business-news/latest-business-news/2010/05/13/narec-in-advanced-talks-on-wind-turbine-tests-51140-26434889/2/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although one of the few high voltage testing facilities in the world,{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} the facility was closed by Narec in 2011 due to a lack of government funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shieldsgazette.com/news/business/latest-news/plug_could_be_pulled_on_testing_lab_1_3230372|title=Plug could be pulled on testing lab|work=shieldsgazette.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many parts of the lab were relocated to Narec's main campus in Blyth. The ruins of the original lab are now the property of [[Siemens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2013/02/urban-explorers-highlight-decay-highest-voltage-lab-world|title=Urban explorers highlight the decay of the highest voltage lab in the world|work=newstatesman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current facilities==

===Charles Parsons Technology Centre===

Built in 2004, this £5m facility contains a low voltage electrical laboratory for the testing of connecting renewable energy systems to the transmission and distribution grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onenortheast.co.uk/page/news/article.cfm?articleId=685%7ctitle=onenortheast.co.uk%7cwork=onenortheast.co.uk|title=onenortheast.co.uk|work=onenortheast.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the equipment and staff from the closed Narec Clothier Electrical Testing Laboratory were moved to this facility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.narec.co.uk/electrical_networks_info/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training tower===

== Organization of research—laboratories and programs ==

NCAR is currently organized into seven laboratories and two programs:&lt;ref name=orgchart&gt;[https://ncar.ucar.edu/org-chart NCAR's Clickable Organization Chart]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Laboratories'''
* Atmospheric Chemistry Observations and Modeling laboratory (ACOM)
* Climate and Global Dynamics laboratory (CGD)
* Computational &amp; Information Systems Laboratory (CISL)—CISL was formerly known as the Scientific Computing Division (SCD).  CISL manages and operates NCAR's supercomputers, mass storage system, networking, and other computing and cyberinfrastructure services. The Institute for Mathematics Applied to Geosciences (IMAGe) is a research division within CISL.&lt;ref name=orgchart&gt;[https://ncar.ucar.edu/org-chart NCAR's Clickable Organization Chart]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Earth Observing Laboratory (EOL)—EOL was formerly known as the Atmospheric Technology Division (ATD). EOL manages and operates NCAR's lower atmosphere observing systems, including ground-based instrumentation and two research aircraft, on behalf of the NSF.
* High Altitude Observatory (HAO)—The oldest part of NCAR, HAO is NCAR's solar-terrestrial physics laboratory. Research foci are the Sun and the Earth's upper atmosphere. HAO operates the Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (MLSO). 
* Mesoscale and Microscale Meteorology laboratory (MMM)
* Research Applications Laboratory (RAL)

'''Programs'''
* Advanced Study Program (ASP)
* Integrated Science Program (ISP)

NCAR's service to the universities and larger geosciences community is reinforced by the offerings of UCAR's [[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research|community programs]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucp.ucar.edu/ UCAR Community Programs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=highlights&gt;[https://www2.ucar.edu/highlights UCAR Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding and management ==
NCAR is managed by the nonprofit [[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research|UCAR]] and is one of the [[National Science Foundation|NSF]]'s [[Federally Funded Research and Development Center]]s, with approximately 95% of its funding coming from the federal government. However, it is not a federal agency and its employees are not part of the federal personnel system.&lt;ref name=quickfacts/&gt; NCAR employs about 761 staff. Its annual expenditures in fiscal year 2015 were $167.8 million.&lt;ref name=quickfacts/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://ncar.ucar.edu/budget-and-planning/public NCAR Annual Report&lt;/ref&gt;

== NCAR Directors ==
The founding director of NCAR was [[Walter Orr Roberts]].&lt;ref name="Directors"&gt;[https://www2.ucar.edu/about-us/ncar-directors NCAR Directors]&lt;/ref&gt; The current director is James Hurrell.&lt;ref name="Director"/&gt;

'''R/V ''Rachel Carson''''' is a [[research vessel]] owned and operated by the [[University of Washington]]'s School of Oceanography, named in honor of the marine biologist and writer [[Rachel Carson]]. The vessel is part of the [[University-National Oceanographic Laboratory System|UNOLS]] fleet. It is capable of conducting operations within the [[Salish Sea]] and coastal waters of the western United States and British Columbia. She can accommodate up to 28 persons, including the crew, for day operations, while up to 13 can be accommodated for multi-day operations.&lt;ref name="UWSO-RVRC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="king5-1st-voyage"/&gt;

==Service history==

===R/V ''Aora'', 2003–2016=== 
The ship was originally launched in May 2003 at the Macduff Shipyard in [[Macduff, Aberdeenshire|Macduff]], Scotland, as the 
R/V ''Aora'', a [[fisheries research vessel]].&lt;ref name="UWSO-RVRC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ocean.washington.edu/story/RV_Rachel_Carson |title=R/V Rachel Carson |date=2018 |website=University of Washington School of Oceanography |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was based at the [[University Marine Biological Station Millport]] in the [[Firth of Clyde]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riverclydephotography.uk/2010/12/rv-aora.html |title=R/V Aora |last=Ward |first=Gerard |date=6 December 2010 |website=River Clyde Photography |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the station was closed in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.field-studies-council.org/centres/scotland/millport/about/history.aspx |title=Millport History |website=[[Field Studies Council]] |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===R/V ''Rachel Carson'', 2017–present=== 
In 2015 the University of Washington's School of Oceanography wanted to replace the fifty-year old {{ship|RV|Clifford A. Barnes}}, but were unable to raise the funds required to design and build a replacement. In December 2016 they found the ''Aora'' for sale on a yacht-trading website.&lt;ref name="king5-1st-voyage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/uw-launches-1st-voyage-saturday-on-bigger-better-research-ship/281-536058226 |title=UW launches 1st voyage Saturday on bigger, better research ship |last=Farley |first=Glenn  |date=6 April 2018 |website=[[KING-TV]] |access-date=25 November 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407042551/https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/uw-launches-1st-voyage-saturday-on-bigger-better-research-ship/281-536058226 |archive-date=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irso.info"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.irso.info/wp-content/uploads/Russell-RV-Rachel-Carson-Presentation-26-Sept-2018-IRSO-copy.pdf |title=R/V Rachel Carson |first=Doug |last=Russell |date=26 September 2018 |website=International Research Ship Operators |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an inspection in March 2017, the ship was purchased for $1.07m on 8 August 2017,&lt;ref name="irso.info"/&gt; with the aid of a $1m gift.&lt;ref name="new-uw-vessel"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2018/05/10/new-uw-vessel-rv-rachel-carson-will-explore-regional-waters/ |title=New UW vessel, RV Rachel Carson, will explore regional waters |last=Hickey |first=Hannah |date=May 10, 2018 |website=UW News |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A programme of maintenance and some modifications at the MacDuff yard were completed in October, and the ''Rachel Carson'' was transported by ship from [[Rotterdam]] to [[West Palm Beach, Florida]] by early November.&lt;ref name="irso.info"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.macduffshipdesign.com/news/the-rachel-carson-transported-to-the-university-of-washington/ |title=The "Rachel Carson" transported to the University of Washington |date=16 December 2017 |website=MacDuff Ship Design |access-date=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was then transported to the University of Washington, arriving on 28 December.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3892">A '''range-finder painting''', sometimes called '''range-finding painting''',&lt;ref name=walter-bloom/&gt; is a large [[landscape painting]] produced as a training device to help gunners improve their accuracy. Historically, the best-documented use of such paintings was in the United States during [[World War I]].

==History==
During World War I, some military gunnery training was carried out indoors.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; While it is relatively simple to train gunners in [[Rangefinder|range-finding]] (that is, estimating the correct distance for their shots) outdoors, it is difficult to train them in long-range gunnery indoors.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; To solve this problem, the British&lt;ref name=walter-bloom/&gt; and U.S. militaries tested the use of large landscape paintings showing distant sites for range-finding and target-sighting in indoor gun ranges.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; These so-called range-finder paintings proved so successful that a program was organized in the United States to produce them in larger numbers.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; They were also used to teach soldiers how to draw military maps in the field and how to identify points of military importance such as zones of good cover.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt;

In 1918, the [[Salmagundi Club]] in New York spearheaded the effort to produce range-finder paintings for the U.S. military, providing canvas and painting materials.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; The program resulted in dozens of landscape paintings of various French and Belgian sites that were roughly {{convert|50|x|70|in|m}}.&lt;ref name=hassrick/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson/&gt; Most showed towns and villages in the near or middle distance, along with other militarily important features such as roads, bridges, canals, fields, forests, and hills.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt; 

The painter [[Ernest L. Blumenschein]] helped to draft and organize artists across the United States for this effort, especially in his home town of [[Taos, New Mexico]], and nearby [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]].&lt;ref name=hassrick/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson/&gt; In Taos alone, 15 such range-finder paintings of landscapes in France were produced in 1918.&lt;ref name=hassrick/&gt; Some of these were sent to [[Camp Cody (military camp)|Camp Cody]] in southern New Mexico and to [[Camp Funston]] in Kansas.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt;

Artists who participated besides Blumenschein included [[Gustave Baumann]], [[O.E. Berninghaus]], [[Harriet Blackstone]], [[Paul Burlin]], Ethel Coe, [[E. Irving Couse]], [[W. Herbert Dunton]], [[Leon Gaspard]], Burt Harwood, Lee Hersch, J.T. Hunter, Sheldon Parsons, [[Bert Geer Phillips]], J.H. Sharp, [[Walter Ufer]], [[Cordelia Wilson]], and Jay Young-Hunter.&lt;ref name=walter/&gt;&lt;ref name=larson/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12209">The '''Regional Studies Association''' ('''RSA''') is an international learned society that is concerned with the analysis of regions and regional issues. The Regional Studies Association works with its international and interdisciplinary membership to facilitate the highest standards of theoretical development, empirical analysis and policy debate of issues at this sub-national scale, incorporating both the urban and rural and different conceptions of space such as city regions and interstitial spaces. We are, for example, interested in issues of economic development and growth, conceptions of territory and its governance and in thorny problems of equity and injustice.

[[File:RSA logo.jpg|thumb|Regional Studies Association logo]]

It runs a programme of international conferences and events based on excellence that has been growing steadily over the years and plays a major role in the Association’s aim in supporting its members disseminate their research. These events also create debates and offer opportunities for those who wish to be part of a community where high quality events are also the place to network within a friendly atmosphere, present their work to international audiences and strengthen their careers. In 2017, the RSA organised events in Ireland, Brazil, China, Romania, Belgium, Australia, UK &amp; Russia. The RSA was a key partner in the European Week of Regions and Cities and we were coordinating the #EURegionsWeek 2017 University sessions and EU Cohesion Policy Master Class. 

The association publishes 5 journals with the publisher [[Taylor and Francis]]: [[Regional Studies (journal) |''Regional Studies'']],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=cres20|title=Regional Studies :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Spatial Economic Analysis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=rsea20|title=Spatial Economic Analysis :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Territory, Politics, Governance'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=rtep20|title=Territory, Politics, Governance :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[open access journal]] ''Regional Studies, Regional Science'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsa.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=aimsScope&amp;journalCode=rsrs20|title=Regional Studies, Regional Science :|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Area Development and Policy'', that engages with the transformation of the modern world as a result of development of the global South/Greater [[BRICS]]. The ''Regions and Cities'' Book Series&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tandfbuiltenvironment.com/books/series/Regions_and_Cities|title=Built Environment - Routledge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is published by [[Routledge]] in association with the RSA. The Book Series Editor-in-Chief is Joan Fitzgerald (Northeastern University, USA). ''Regions'' magazine is the membership magazine and the voice of the RSA membership.

It has allocated financial resources to support its members and offer a range of funding opportunities to suit different career stages. These opportunities provide members with the chance to apply for financial help to support their research, run networking events, receive awards for excellence and help towards the costs of travel to attend non-RSA events and present their work to international audiences. The RSA offers the following funding opportunities: '''Travel Grant''' up to £500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/rsa-travel-grant|title=RSA Travel Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Policy Expo'''  up to £15,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/policy-expo-grant-scheme|title=RSA Policy Expo Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Membership Research Grant (MeRSA)''' up to £5,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/rsa-MeRSA-Grant|title=RSA Membership Research Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Fellowship Research Grant (FeRSA)''' up to £7,500&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/rsa-fellowship-research-grant-scheme|title=RSA Fellowship Research Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt;, '''Early Career Research Grant''' up to £10,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/early-career-grant-scheme|title=RSA Early Career Research Grant Scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; and '''Research Network Grant Scheme''' up to £10,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding/page/research-network-grants|title=RSA Research network grant}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The RSA's Research Networks are formed by RSA members to organise a series of events to examine an issue of collective interest. 

There is an extensive '''international network''' of around 70 Ambassadors, five Divisions (China, Latin America, Northern Europe, India and Russia), five country Sections (Hungary, Poland, Scotland, Ireland and Wales) and six UK regional Branches which support members in their own locales. We also have a non-profit Foundation in Belgium (RSA Europe). These international networks work together with the Association to expend the opportunities and benefits offered to its members but also to those who do not yet know the Association. These networks are set up to organise a range of activities that are open to all to attend and they have the role of informing and disseminating information on regional studies at a regional and/or national level. They also act as an invaluable link to the Association for those who work in a language other than English but also for those who cannot attend all the major events directly organised by the Association&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/networks|title=RSA International Networks}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The RSA's Chair is Professor Mark Tewdwr-Jones, Director of Newcastle City Futures and Chair of Town Planning, Newcastle University, UK. The RSA’s previous Chair (2012-2017) was Professor Andrew Beer, Dean, Research &amp; Innovation at UniSA Business School, Australia. He succeeded Professor [[David Bailey (academic economist and commentator)|David Bailey]] who served as Chair over 2006–12. Sally Hardy is Chief Executive for the past 30 years. The RSA President is Ron Martin, University of Cambridge, UK. The previous RSA President was [[Peter Hall (urbanist)|Sir Peter Hall]] until 2014.

[[Peter Hall (urbanist)|Sir Peter Hall]] was awarded the RSA's Prize for Outstanding Contribution to the field of Regional Studies at the RSA's Presidential Lunch held at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in September 2008. In subsequent years the association has awarded an annual Sir Peter Hall Prize for outstanding contribution to the field of Regional Studies, with recipients including Ann Markusen, John Bachtler, John Goddard, [[Michael Storper]], [[Allen J. Scott]], Ray Hudson, Brian Robson, Susan Christopherson and [[Saskia Sassen]]  in 2017. The RSA also awards excellence in the field with its Best Book Award, Nathaniel Lichfield Award, RSA and Routledge Early Career Award, as well as its Best Paper and Best Referee Awards for all its academic journals (''Regional Studies; Spatial Economic Analysis; Territory, Politics, Governance; Regional Studies, Regional Science; Area Development and Policy'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.regionalstudies.org/funding|title=RSA Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The RSA is a member society of the Academy of Social Sciences, previously known as the [[Academy of Learned Societies in the Social Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acss.org.uk/about6.htm |title=Academy of Social Sciences |publisher=Acss.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association is also a recognised United Nations NGO with Consultative Status (ECOSOC).

The '''Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science''' ('''RDFRS''' or '''RDF''') is a division of [[Center for Inquiry]] (CFI) founded by British biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] in 2006 to promote scientific literacy and secularism.

Originally a non-profit based in Washington, D.C., the organization merged with CFI in 2016.

==History==
After Richard Dawkins’ success with the book ''[[The God Delusion]]'', he created the foundation with its headquarters in the United States to work toward a world in which religion no longer interferes with the advance of science and in which people use their critical thinking skills to evaluate theist claims about the nature of reality.

Dawkins complained of the difficulty he faced in gaining tax-free status, which he attributes to the secular nature of the organization. In contrast to the presumption by officials that religious organizations benefit humanity without evidence (for instance [[Our Lady of Perpetual Exemption]]), he points to a letter he received from the British Charity Commission requesting evidence for the claim that the advancement of science is connected to the public good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution |last=Dawkins |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |year=2009 |publisher=[[Bantam Press]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-593-06173-2 |oclc= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theist author Marion Ledwig suggests that the foundation may have been set up as an atheist counterpart to the [[John Templeton Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=God's Rational Warriors |year=2008 |first=Marion |last=Ledwig |publisher=Ontos-Verlag |isbn=978-3-938793-87-9 |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; an organization which Dawkins has publicly criticized, especially in ''[[The God Delusion]]'', for corrupting science. In a [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk prior to writing ''The God Delusion'', Dawkins had called for the need for an "anti-Templeton" to step up, saying that if his books sold better, he would take the initiative himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/richard_dawkins_on_militant_atheism.html Dawkins 2002 TED talk] accessed 2010-04-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins describes his foundation’s purpose this way:&lt;blockquote&gt;“Critical thinking is the real saviour of humankind. My foundation promotes respect for people who hold critical thinking as a cherished personal value and use it in day-to-day life. The logical counter to religious extremism is people who rely on evidence to make decisions. Yet the voice of secular people is maligned in this country. Forty-five percent of Americans think you have to believe in God to be moral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.people-press.org/2014/06/26/section-5-views-on-religion-the-bible-evolution-and-social-issues/|title = PewResearchCenter|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Secular voices are considered immoral. They are not listened to on that basis. We must counter this baseless hostility to allow the contributions of secular people in vital national debates to count. Making secular views and people welcome in politics and policy-making will advance human safety, security, health, achievement, prosperity and most of all, ''science''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://richarddawkins.net/aboutus/|title = Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The organization began accepting members in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://richarddawkins.net/join/#|title = Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among its activities, RDFRS finances research into the psychology of belief and religion, finances scientific education programs and materials, and publicizes and supports [[secularism|secular]] charitable organisations.&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richarddawkins.net/pages/mission |title=Our Mission |accessdate=2006-11-17 |work=richarddawkins.net |publisher=The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation has been granted charitable status in the United Kingdom and status as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit [[Private foundation (United States)|private operating foundation]] in the United States. RDFRS financed research on the [[psychology of religion|psychology of belief and religion]], financed scientific education programs and materials, and publicised and supported [[charitable organisation]]s that are [[secularity|secular]] in nature. The foundation also offers [[humanism|humanist]], [[rationalism|rationalist]], and [[science|scientific]] materials through its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.richarddawkins.net/foundation,ourMission |title=Our Mission |accessdate=17 November 2006 |publisher=The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061117150429/http://www.richarddawkins.net/foundation,ourMission |archivedate =17 November 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins has said the "trend toward theocratic thinking in the United States is a danger not only for America but for the entire world."&lt;ref name="RDFfaircloth" /&gt;  Connected to this concern, Dawkins invited [[Sean Faircloth]] to serve as opening speaker on Dawkins's 2011 US book tour. Faircloth is author of the book ''Attack of the Theocrats, How the Religious Right Harms Us All and What We Can Do About It''. The Richard Dawkins Foundation (United States branch) later hired Faircloth, who has ten years experience as a state legislator, as Director of Strategy and Policy.&lt;ref name="RDFfaircloth"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://richarddawkins.net/articles/643044-sean-faircloth-joins-rdfrs-us-as-director-of-strategy-and-policy |title=Sean Faircloth joins RDFRS (US) as Director of Strategy and Policy |accessdate=1 October 2011 |publisher=The Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006003447/http://richarddawkins.net/articles/643044-sean-faircloth-joins-rdfrs-us-as-director-of-strategy-and-policy |archivedate=4 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
{{Reduced pull quote|1=right
|2=Next time somebody tells you something that sounds important, think to yourself: 'Is this the kind of thing that people probably know because of evidence? Or is it the kind of thing that people only believe because of tradition, authority or revelation?' And, next time somebody tells you that something is true, why not say to them: 'What kind of evidence is there for that?' And if they can't give you a good answer, I hope you'll think very carefully before you believe a word they say.

}}

RDFRS also invests in creating, producing and influencing the development of entertainment products for general audiences that support secularism and fight scientific illiteracy.

===2009===
In March 2009, following proposed [[anti-evolution]] resolutions by Oklahoma State Representative [[Todd Thomsen]], including condemning a visit by Dawkins to Oklahoma,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://ncse.com/news/2009/03/antievolution-resolutions-introduced-oklahoma-004637 | title=Antievolution resolutions introduced in Oklahoma | publisher=[[National Center for Science Education]] |date= March 7, 2009 | first= | last= | accessdate =2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; he instructed the U.S. branch of the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science to donate $5,000 to Oklahomans for Excellence in Science Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.normantranscript.com/localnews/local_story_066011126 | title=Dawkins lecture draws thousands at OU | publisher=[[Norman Transcript]] |date=March 7, 2009 | first= | last= | accessdate =2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://richarddawkins.net/article,3646,Richard-Dawkins-at-the-University-of-Oklahoma---Introduction,Richard-Dawkins | title=Richard Dawkins at the University of Oklahoma - Introduction | publisher=Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science |date=March 7, 2009 | first= | last= | accessdate =2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011===
In March 2011, the RDFRS along with the [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]] began [[The Clergy Project]] which is a confidential on-line community that supports members as they move from their faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.clergyproject.org/ | title=The Clergy Project | accessdate=6 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-04-30/national/35451816_1_pastors-daniel-dennett-faith | title=For clergy, lost faith can lead to lost family, jobs | publisher=The Washington Post | date=30 April 2012 | accessdate=6 August 2013 | author=Winston, Kimberly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014===
In 2014 RDFRS joined several similar organizations, including the Stiefel Freethought Foundation, the [[Secular Student Alliance]], and the [[Secular Coalition for America]], to form Openly Secular, an initiative which aims to combat and draw attention to anti-atheist discrimination and to encourage more people to openly self-identify as nonbelievers.&lt;ref name="dawkinsopenlysecular"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://richarddawkins.net/2014/07/announcing-the-openly-secular-coalition/|title=Announcing the Openly Secular coalition|work=Richarddawkins.net|date=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="winston"&gt;{{cite web|title=New 'Openly Secular' group seeks to combat anti-atheist discrimination|date=2 May 2014|first1=Kimberly|last1=Winston|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/religion/new-openly-secular-group-seeks-to-combat-anti-atheist-discrimination/2014/05/02/b8195ba8-d231-11e3-a714-be7e7f142085_story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Atheist Groups Form New Coalition to Fight 'Discrimination'|work=Christian Post|date=3 May 2014|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/atheist-groups-form-new-coalition-to-fight-discrimination-119064/|first1=Anugrah|last1=Kumar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the strategies is to get celebrities to come forward as openly secular. Videos have been posted by [[Penn &amp; Teller]], [[Bill Maher]], NFL star [[Arian Foster]], [[Julia Sweeney]], [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.openlysecular.org|title = Openly Secular|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015===
In April 2015, RDFRS launched the Teacher Institute for Evolutionary Science (TIES) to provide middle school teachers with workshops and free online tools to teach evolution and answer its critics. TIES is led by Bertha Vazquez, an award-winning middle school science teacher in Miami, FL.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://richarddawkins.net/ties|title = TIES|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 ===
In January 2016, RDFRS announced that it was merging with the [[Center for Inquiry]], with [[Robyn Blumner]] as the CEO of the combined organizations.&lt;ref name="An Important Announcement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/news/an_important_announcement_from_cfi_president_ronald_a._lindsay/|title=An Important Announcement from CFI President Ronald A.

The merger was completed in December 2016, with RDFRS becoming a division of CFI.&lt;ref name="merger complete"&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Great Freethought Organizations Are Now One|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/news/cfi-rdf-merger-complete/|publisher=Center for Inquiry|accessdate=1 January 2017|date=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is Professor of the [[School of Human Evolution and Social Change]]&amp;nbsp;(SHESC) at [[Arizona State University]]&amp;nbsp;(ASU). His research interests include [[evolutionary psychology]] and in particular the evolutionary roots of [[culture]]. Together with his [[primatologist]] wife, [[Joan B. Silk]] (who is also a Professor in SHESC at ASU), he wrote the textbook ''How Humans Evolved''.

==Life==
Boyd was born in [[San Francisco]]. He studied [[physics]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (B.A., 1970). In 1975, he completed a Ph.D. in [[ecology]] at the [[University of California, Davis]]. From 1980 to 1984, he was [[Assistant Professor]] of the Department of [[Forestry]] and [[Environmental Science]] at [[Duke University]]. Afterwards, he taught two years in the Department of Anthropology at [[Emory University]]. From 1988 to 2012, Boyd was on the faculty of the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] Department of Anthropology. He is currently a Professor at the [[School of Human Evolution and Social Change]] at [[Arizona State University]].

The '''Seljuk stucco figures''' are [[stucco]] ([[plaster]]) figures found in the region of the [[Seljuk Empire]], from its "golden age" between the 11th and 13th centuries. They decorated the inner walls and friezes of Seljuk palaces, together with other ornamented stucco ornaments, concealing the wall behind them. The figures were painted bright-colored and often gilded. They represented royal figures and were symbols of power and authority. 

==Islamic art of Seljuk==
The Seljuks were a [[Turkish people|Turkic]] dynasty of [[Central Asia]]n nomadic origins, who became the new rulers of the eastern Islamic world after defeating the [[Ghaznavids]] in the [[Battle of Dandanaqan]], and the [[Buyid dynasty]]. Following these victories, the Seljuks established themselves as the new patrons of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and [[Sunni Islam]]. In only half-a-century, the Seljuks managed to create a vast empire encompassing modern [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], and much of [[Anatolia]]. Under the Seljuks, Iran enjoyed a period of cultural prosperity. Multitudes of architecture and arts were developed during the period, and influenced later artistic developments in the region and the surrounding.{{sfn|Yalman|2001}}

In ceramics, fine motifs were created in underglaze painting, luster decorations, and polychrome painting. Metal objects were decorated with [[inlay]]s of silver and gold. The Seljuks developed many figurative motifs with frequent depiction of animals, men, and women.&lt;ref name="dk"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.davidmus.dk/en/collections/islamic/dynasties/seljuks |title=The Seljuks and their Successors |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |website=THE DAVID COLLECTION  |publisher=THE DAVID COLLECTION  |access-date=November 10, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anthropomorphic representation of figures are not rare at all in the Muslim culture. Whereas iconic image in holy places e.g. mosques are strictly forbidden, in secular places, depiction of figures are common.&lt;ref name="metwar"/&gt;

All the Seljuk palaces are now in ruins. Excavations indicate that these palaces had once been decorated with tiles and with stucco wall [[relief]]s of geometric patterns and figures. In Lashgari Bazar, a ruin of former Ghaznavid period palace, polychrome [[fresco]]es depicting 44 soldiers were found decorating the lower floor of the audience hall. They all have similar round faces and almond-shaped eyes, traditionally associated with the [[Turkish people|Turks]] of Central Asia.{{sfn|Öney|1984|pp=133-5}}  

The stucco figures would have decorated similar royal palaces in the audience hall or the royal court. They were found decorating large palaces of the Seljuk sultans, or smaller royal courts of the local vassals or successors.&lt;ref name="metwar"/&gt; The stucco figures may be part of larger stucco geometric ornamentation which conceals the base wall behind it. One example of stucco figures in complete form comes from the late 12th century [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], which depicts the enthroned Seljuk Sultan Tughril II (1194) surrounded by his officers. Similar examples were found in [[Bast, Afghanistan]], in [[Samarkand]], and in [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref name="kianush"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artarena.force9.co.uk/seljuks.htm |title=THE SELJUKS 11th - 13th Century |last=Kianush |first=K. |date=1999 |website=IRANSAGA |publisher=Art Arena |access-date=November 10, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were painted in bright colors of red, blue, black, and gilded with gold. The dark room in the palace where they were placed means that this figure needs to stand out as much as possible.&lt;ref name="metwar"/&gt;

==Form==
[[File:Persian - Standing Warrior Holding a Sword - Walters 241.jpg|thumb|left|Stucco figures of a warrior discovered in Iran. This is painted with red, blue, black, and gilded with gold.]]
Stucco or plaster is a soft, cement-like water-based material that is easy to carve when dry and [[mold]] when still wet. Its lightness makes it easy to affix to walls. Many 12th-century stucco figures survived in pristine condition because of the preserving dryness of the desert where they were found. Seljuk stucco figures were painted in bright colors of blue (powdered [[lapis lazuli]]), red (powdered [[ruby]]), and black colors, and were gilded with gold.&lt;ref name="metwar"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/451909 |title=Standing Figure with Jeweled Headdress |date=2017 |website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |access-date=November 10, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The figures were representations of power. In a royal palace setting, they represent figures related to the power of the empire, e.g. royal guards, royal viziers, courtiers or [[emir|amir]]. Warrior figures were depicted clutching swords. They wear rich colored caftans, trousers, [[tiraz|tiraz bands]] and long boots. Royal figures were depicted wearing crowns. The two figures in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]] are wearing crowns, one figure is wearing the winged crown, an ancient symbol of authority which was first recorded in a 3rd century [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] coins. All of the Seljuk stucco figures have round faces with typical high cheekbones and almond-shaped eyes, known as the Turkic moon face, which reflect the indicating the Turkic and Mongol ethnic type.&lt;ref name="dk"/&gt; The stucco figures were usually displayed in a pomp and circumstance setting, enhancing the actual ceremonies that took place in the room where the figures were set.&lt;ref name="metwar"/&gt;

The '''Signature Bridge''' is a [[Cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge|cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge]] which spans the [[Yamuna]] river at Wazirabad section, connecting [[Wazirabad, Delhi|Wazirabad]] to [[East Delhi]].&lt;ref name=NDTV&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/signature-bridge-to-be-ready-by-october-arvind-kejriwal-1878987|title= Signature Bridge To Be Ready By October: Arvind Kejriwal|date= 6 July 2018| accessdate=6 July 2018|publisher= www.ndtv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is India's first asymmetrical [[cable-stayed bridge]].&lt;ref name=NDTV/&gt; The [[Tower#Transportation support|pylon]] of the Signature bridge is the tallest structure in Delhi and is double the height of [[Qutb Minar]] with its 154-metre high viewing box, which acts as selfie points for visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/154-metre-high-viewing-box-selfie-points-delhi-s-signature-bridge-opens-tomorrow/story-ss5rUlwFk5PI7Tkz2SV2AL.html|title=154-metre high viewing box, selfie points: Delhi’s Signature Bridge opens today}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shortens the travel time between north and northeast Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/as-signature-bridge-opens-rush-to-ease-on-ring-road-and-nh-9/articleshow/66493331.cms?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=TOIDesktop|title=As Delhi's Signature Bridge opens, rush to ease on Ring Road and National Highway-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Wazirabad bridge on sahibi river.jpg|thumb|left|The old wazirabad bridge]]
In 1997, 28 school students died in an accident on the narrow Wazirabad bridge.&lt;ref name= kolkata24x7/&gt; Since then, the Delhi government had plans to build another parallel wide bridge nearby to alleviate traffic congestions. By the end of 1998, the [[Government of Delhi|Delhi government]] finalised the draft plan for this bridge.&lt;ref name= kolkata24x7/&gt; The bridge was inaugurated on 4 November 2018 by the Chief Minister of Delhi [[Arvind Kejriwal]] with the aim to ease the burgeoning traffic congestion on the existing [[Wazirabad]] bridge.&lt;ref name= Y/&gt;&lt;ref name="NDTV_inaugration"&gt;{{cite news |title=Delhi's Signature Bridge To Have Selfie Spots, Glass Viewing Deck |url=https://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/delhi-signature-bridge-opens-to-public-on-monday-heres-what-it-offers-1942195 |accessdate=4 November 2018 |publisher=NDTV |date=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
By the end of 1998, the Delhi government finalized the draft plan made by Divyansh Sharma for the construction of the bridge. However, the construction of the bridge was stuck due to multiple reasons - lack of manpower and financial difficulties, being the major reason. When the project started, its cost was estimated to be ₹1,100&amp;nbsp;crore. Now it has surpassed  ₹1,875&amp;nbsp;crores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= More funds for Signature Bridge may help it meet latest dead|url= https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/more-funds-for-signature-bridge-may-help-it-meet-latest-deadline/articleshow/64890739.cms|date=  7 July 2018| accessdate= 7 July 2018 |publisher=Times of India }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=theweekendleader&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theweekendleader.com/Headlines/13516/delhi-government-clears-signature-bridge-project.html|title=Delhi government clears signature bridge project |date= 6 July 2018| accessdate=7 July 2018|publisher=www.theweekendleader.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Government of Delhi|Delhi government]] was tight handed and it was very difficult for it to shell out the extra rising budget. ₹1,244&amp;nbsp;crores of rupees have been sanctioned recently through PBDB. The work had started in full swing in 2004 on the bridge. A fresh deadline of end 2016 was set in 2013.&lt;ref name=theweekendleader/&gt; Since then half a dozen times, deadlines have been missed and fresh deadlines set. Finally, the bridge was inaugurated in November 2018.&lt;ref name=kolkata24x7&gt;{{cite news|url=https://kolkata24x7.com/delhi-may-get-indias-first-asymmetrical-cable-stayed-bridge-by-october-will-decongest-wazirabad-bridge.html|title= নজির গড়ে দেশের বুকে তৈরি হচ্ছে প্রথম ‘অ্যাসমিট্রিক্যাল’ ব্রিজ|date= 6 July 2018| accessdate=6 July 2018|publisher= kolkata24x7.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The bridge is a [[Cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge]], a type of [[Cable-stayed bridge]] and in which cables were in a combination of radial and semi-harp arrangement, in which cables are spaced apart on the pylon, like the harp design, but connect to one point or a number of closely spaced points on the deck.&lt;ref name="Dayaratnam2000"&gt;{{cite book|author1=T.K.

The name refers to the fact that the participants will attempt to "[[spin (public relations)|spin]]" or influence the perception of the debate among the assembled reporters. The benefit for reporters is that they quickly get in-person interviews with debaters or their representatives, complete with audio, video and photos. For a [[United States presidential election debates|U.S. presidential debate]], the number of reporters in the spin room can number into the thousands.&lt;ref name="TwitterSpin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Calderone|first=Michael|title=For 2012 Presidential Debates, Campaigns Speed Up The Spin|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/01/2012-presidential-debates-spin-room_n_1929185.html|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=2 October 2012|date=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest known spin room was set up by the [[political campaign|campaign]] of U.S. president [[Ronald Reagan]] in 1984. In a hotel banquet room, campaign officials spoke on the record with [[talking point]]s playing up their own candidate's debate performance and minimizing opponent [[Walter Mondale]]'s success, despite many observers believing Mondale had just won. This operation was dubbed the "spin patrol."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Santini|first=Maureen|title='Spin patrol' spins out|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=toNGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2229,1288893|accessdate=18 October 2012|newspaper=The Evening News|date=13 October 1984|agency=The Associated Press|location=Newburgh-Beacon, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
A spin room may also be active before a debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Zeke|title=Before The Spin Room, Campaigns Pre-Wash The Press|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/zekejmiller/before-the-spin-room-campaigns-pre-wash-the-press|work=BuzzFeed|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common form of pre-debate spin is for each side to try to raise expectations for the opposing debater and lower expectations for their own team, a pursuit known as playing the [[expectations game]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=Leigh Ann|title=What's behind the debate expectations game?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57529085/whats-behind-the-debate-expectations-game/|work=CBS News|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=10 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Some observers have criticized the overt nature of the [[media manipulation]] in spin rooms, and the media's willing participation in it.&lt;ref name="TribCritic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosen|first=Jay|title=Raze Spin Alley, That Strange Creation of the Press|url=http://archive.pressthink.org/2003/11/22/spin_alley.html|work=PressThink|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=22 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lanson|first=Jerry|title=The spin room - oily engine of the political meat grinder|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/1212/p11s01-coop.htm|work=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=12 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders have said reporters know it's scripted and aren't persuaded by the spin, but rather, they use the talking points to analyze candidates' strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hardman|first1=Isabel|title=A (partial) defence of the spin room|url=http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/coffeehouse/2015/04/a-partial-defence-of-the-spin-room/|website=The Spectator|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=30 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spin rooms can occasionally include moments of candor, such as when presidential candidate [[Rick Perry]] admitted that he had "stepped in it" during a debate response that became known as his [[Rick Perry presidential campaign, 2012#November 2011: "Oops" moment and continued struggles|"oops" moment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perry in spin room explains flub: "I stepped in it" (with video)|url=http://blogs.star-telegram.com/politex/2011/11/perry-in-spin-room-explains-flub-i-stepped-in-it-with-video.html|website=PoliTex|accessdate=6 August 2015|date=9 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spin rooms have also been portrayed as outdated in an era of instant online reaction from all quarters before a debate is even over.&lt;ref name="TwitterSpin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaudin|first=Sharon|title=Twitter becomes new debate spin room|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9232060/Twitter_becomes_new_debate_spin_room|work=Computer World|accessdate=17 October 2012|date=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Focus group]]s and instant post-debate "snap [[opinion poll|polls]]" attempt to provide a more scientific method than spin rooms in determining who has won a debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US presidential debate: Early polls give Barack Obama slender victory|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/uselection2008/presidentialdebates/3092194/US-presidential-debate-Early-polls-give-Barack-Obama-slender-victory.html|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=15 October 2015|date=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clegg Beats Brown, Cameron in U.K. TV Debate, Polls Show|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-04-15/clegg-wins-top-mark-in-u-k-debate-polls-as-brown-cameron-stay-deadlocked.html|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=9 November 2012|date=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technological rationality''' or '''technical rationality''' is a philosophical idea postulated by the  [[Frankfurt School]] philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]] in his 1941 article, "Some Implications of Modern Technology", published first in the journal Studies in Philosophy and Social Sciences, Vol. IX. It gained mainstream repute and a more holistic treatment in his 1964 book ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]''. 

It posits that [[Rationality|rational]] decisions to incorporate [[technology|technological]] advances into society can, once the technology is ubiquitous, change what is considered rational within that society.

'''''The Automatic Message''''' (1933) (''Le Message Automatique'') was one of [[André Breton]]'s significant theoretical works about automatism. The essay was first published in the magazine ''[[Minotaure]]'', No. 3-4, (Paris) 1933.

In 1997 it became the title of a compilation of [[surrealism|surrealist]] writing of [[André Breton]], [[Paul Éluard]] and [[Philippe Soupault]], amongst  others. The book includes two vital “automatic” texts of surrealism.

Breton’s prefatory essay ''The Automatic Message'' relates the technique to the underlying concepts and aesthetic of surrealism.

''[[Les Champs Magnétiques|The Magnetic Fields (Les Champs Magnétiques)]]'' (1919) by Breton and Soupault, was the first work of literary surrealism and one of the foundations of modern European thought and writing. ''The Automatic Message'' contains the authorised translation by the poet [[David Gascoyne]], himself a member of the group, and a friend of both authors.

''The Immaculate Conception'' (1930) traces the interior and exterior life of man from ''Conception'' and ''Intra-Uterine Life'' to ''Death and The Original Judgement'', and includes a section with a series of “simulations” of various types of mental instability.
