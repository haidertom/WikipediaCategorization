      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35139">'''Agricultural pollution''' refers to [[biotic material|biotic]] and [[abiotic]] byproducts of [[agriculture|farming]] practices that result in [[pollution|contamination or degradation]] of the environment and surrounding ecosystems, and/or cause injury to humans and their economic interests. The pollution may come from a variety of sources, ranging from [[point source pollution|point source water pollution]] (from a single discharge point) to more diffuse, landscape-level causes, also known as [[non-point source pollution]]. Management practices play a crucial role in the amount and impact of these pollutants. Management techniques range from animal management and housing to the spread of [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s in global agricultural practices.

==Abiotic sources==
===Pesticides===
[[File:Cropduster spraying pesticides.jpg|thumb|alt=Cropduster spraying pesticides.|[[Aerial application]] of [[pesticide]].]]
[[Pesticides]] and [[herbicides]] are applied to agricultural land to control pests that disrupt crop production. [[Soil contamination]] can occur when pesticides persist and accumulate in soils, which can alter [[Microbial metabolism|microbial processes]], increase plant uptake of the chemical, and also cause [[toxicity]] to soil organisms. The extent to which the pesticides and herbicides persist depends on the compound’s unique chemistry, which affects [[sorption]] dynamics and resulting fate and transport in the soil environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/science/efed_databasesdescription.htm |title=Environmental Databases: Ecotoxicity Database |website=Pesticides: Science and Policy |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |date=2006-06-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704074226/http://www.epa.gov/opp00001/science/efed_databasesdescription.htm |archive-date=2014-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pesticides can also accumulate in animals that eat contaminated pests and soil organisms. In addition, pesticides can be more harmful to beneficial insects, such as pollinators, and to natural enemies of pests (i.e. insects that prey on or parasitize pests) than they are to the target pests themselves.&lt;ref name="Gullan"&gt;Gullan, P.J. and Cranston, P.S. (2010) The Insects: An Outline of Entomology, 4th Edition. Blackwell Publishing UK: 584 pp.{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pesticide leaching====
Pesticide leaching occurs when pesticides mix with water and move through the soil, ultimately [[Groundwater pollution|contaminating groundwater]]. The amount of leaching is correlated with particular soil and pesticide characteristics and the degree of rainfall and irrigation. Leaching is most likely to happen if using a water-soluble pesticide, when the soil tends to be sandy in texture; if excessive watering occurs just after pesticide application; if the adsorption ability of the pesticide to the soil is low. Leaching may not only originate from treated fields, but also from pesticide mixing areas, pesticide application machinery washing sites, or disposal areas.&lt;ref name="agf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/pesticides/c_2.htm |title=Environmental Fate of Pesticides |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=Pesticide Wise |publisher=British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture |location=Victoria, BC |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151225091304/http://www.agf.gov.bc.ca/pesticides/c_2.htm |archive-date=2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fertilizers===
Only a fraction of the [[nitrogen]]-based fertilizers is converted to produce and other plant matter. The remainder accumulates in the soil or lost as [[surface runoff|runoff]]. High application rates of nitrogen-containing fertilizers combined with the high water-solubility of [[nitrate]] leads to increased runoff into surface water as well as leaching into groundwater, thereby causing [[groundwater pollution]]. The excessive use of nitrogen-containing fertilizers (be they synthetic or natural) is particularly damaging, as much of the nitrogen that is not taken up by plants is transformed into nitrate which is easily leached. Nitrate levels above 10&amp;nbsp;mg/L (10 ppm) in groundwater can cause "[[blue baby syndrome]]" (acquired methemoglobinemia). The nutrients, especially nitrates, in fertilizers can cause problems for natural habitats and for human health if they are washed off soil into watercourses or leached through soil into groundwater.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Moreover, the abuse of fertilizers caused air pollution in the form of ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tsigaridis|first1=Kostas|last2=Miller|first2=Ron|title=A Major Source of Air Pollution: Farms|url=http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/3281|website=Earth Institute Columbia University|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Cadmium
The concentration of [[cadmium]] in [[phosphorus]]-containing fertilizers varies considerably and can be problematic. For example, mono-ammonium phosphate fertilizer may have a cadmium content of as low as 0.14&amp;nbsp;mg/kg or as high as 50.9&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. This is because the [[phosphate rock]] used in their manufacture can contain as much as 188&amp;nbsp;mg/kg cadmium (examples are deposits on Nauru and the Christmas islands). Continuous use of high-cadmium fertilizer can contaminate soil and plants. Limits to the cadmium content of phosphate fertilizers has been considered by the [[European Commission]]. Producers of phosphorus-containing fertilizers now select phosphate rock based on the cadmium content.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

;Fluoride
Phosphate rocks contain high levels of [[fluoride]]. Consequently, the widespread use of phosphate fertilizers has increased soil fluoride concentrations. It has been found that food contamination from fertilizer is of little concern as plants accumulate little fluoride from the soil; of greater concern is the possibility of fluoride toxicity to livestock that ingest contaminated soils. Also of possible concern are the effects of fluoride on soil microorganisms.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

;Radioactive elements
The radioactive content of the fertilizers varies considerably and depends both on their concentrations in the parent mineral and on the fertilizer production process. [[Uranium-238]] concentrations range can range from 7 to 100 pCi/g in phosphate rock and from 1 to 67 pCi/g in phosphate fertilizers. Where high annual rates of phosphorus fertilizer are used, this can result in uranium-238 concentrations in soils and drainage waters that are several times greater than are normally present. However, the impact of these increases on the risk to human health from radinuclide contamination of foods is very small (less than 0.05 mSv/y).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

;Other metals
[[Steel industry]] wastes, which are recycled into fertilizers for their high levels of [[zinc]] (essential to plant growth), can include the following toxic metals: [[lead]], [[arsenic]], cadmium, [[chromium]], and [[nickel]]. The most common toxic elements in this type of fertilizer are [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], lead, and arsenic. These potentially harmful impurities can be removed; however, this significantly increases cost. Highly pure fertilizers are widely available and perhaps best known as the highly water-soluble fertilizers containing blue dyes used around households, such as [[Miracle-Gro]]. These highly water-soluble fertilizers are used in the plant nursery business and are available in larger packages at significantly less cost than retail quantities. There are also some inexpensive retail granular garden fertilizers made with high purity ingredients.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Leaching, runoff, and eutrophication====
[[File:Potomac river eutro.jpg|thumb|alt=The bright green water in the Potomac River estuary is result of a dense bloom of cyanobacteria.|[[Eutrophication]] of the [[Potomac River]].]]
The [[nitrogen]] (N) and [[phosphorus]] (P) applied to agricultural land (via synthetic fertilizers, composts, manures, biosolids, etc.) can provide valuable plant nutrients. However, if not managed correctly, excess N and P can have negative environmental consequences. Excess N supplied by both synthetic fertilizers (as highly soluble nitrate) and organic sources such as [[manure]]s (whose organic N is mineralized to nitrate by soil microorganisms) can lead to groundwater contamination of nitrate. Nitrate-contaminated drinking water can cause [[blue baby syndrome]]. Together with excess P from these same fertilizer sources, [[eutrophication]] can occur downstream due to excess nutrient supply, leading to [[anoxic waters|anoxic]] areas called dead zones.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Organic contaminants====
[[Manures]] and [[biosolids]] contain many nutrients consumed by animals and humans in the form of food. The practice of returning such waste products to agricultural land presents an opportunity to recycle soil nutrients. The challenge is that manures and biosolids contain not only nutrients such as carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, but they may also contain contaminants, including pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs). There is a wide variety and vast quantity of PPCPs consumed by both humans and animals, and each has unique chemistry in terrestrial and aquatic environments. As such, not all have been assessed for their effects on soil, water, and air quality. The [[US Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has surveyed sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants across the US to assess levels of various PPCPs present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/sewage-sludge-surveys |title=Sewage Sludge Surveys |publisher=EPA |website=Biosolids |date=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heavy metals===
The major inputs of [[heavy metals]] (e.g. lead, cadmium, arsenic, mercury) into agricultural systems are fertilizers, organic wastes such as manures, and industrial byproduct wastes. Some farming techniques, such as irrigation, can lead to accumulation of [[selenium]] (Se) that occurs naturally in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ganje |first1=T. J. |chapter=Selenium |year=1966 |editor1-last=Chapman |editor1-first=H. D. |title=Diagnostic Criteria for Plants and Soils |pages=394–404 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result in downstream water reservoirs containing concentrations of selenium that are toxic to wildlife, livestock, and humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0147-6513(03)00064-2 |pmid=15041249 |title=Review of 15 years of research on ecotoxicology and remediation of land contaminated by agricultural drainage sediment rich in selenium |journal=Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety |volume=57 |issue=3 |pages=257–69 |year=2004 |last1=Wu |first1=Lin }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This process is known as the “Kesterson Effect,” eponymously named after the [[Kesterson Reservoir]] in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] (California, USA), which was declared a toxic waste dump in 1987.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

===Land management===
====Tillage and nitrous oxide emissions====
Natural soil biogeochemical processes result in the emission of various greenhouse gases, including nitrous oxide. Agricultural management practices can affect emission levels. For example, tillage levels have also been shown to affect [[nitrous oxide]] emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2134/jeq1998.00472425002700030029x |title=Nitrous Oxide Emission in Three Years as Affected by Tillage, Corn-Soybean-Alfalfa Rotations, and Nitrogen Fertilization |journal=Journal of Environment Quality |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=698–703 |year=1998 |last1=MacKenzie |first1=A. F |last2=Fan |first2=M. X |last3=Cadrin |first3=F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Soil erosion - geograph.org.uk - 1135515.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Soil erosion|Soil erosion: soil has washed from a ploughed field through this gate and into a watercourse beyond.]]

====Soil erosion and sedimentation====
Agriculture contributes greatly to [[soil erosion]] and [[sediment]] deposition through intensive management or inefficient land cover.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Long-Range Soil and Water Conservation, National Research Council. 1993. Soil and Water Quality: An Agenda for Agriculture. National Academy Press: Washington, D.C.{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that agricultural land degradation is leading to an irreversible decline in fertility on about 6 million ha of fertile land each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dudal |first1=R. |year=1981 |chapter=An evaluation of conservation needs |pages=3–12 |title=Soil Conservation, Problems and Prospects |editor1-first=R. P. C. |editor1-last=Morgan |location=Chichester, U.K. |publisher=Wiley }}&lt;/ref&gt; The accumulation of [[sediment]]s (i.e. sedimentation) in [[Surface runoff|runoff]] water affects water quality in various ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Matt |last1=Hangsleben |first2=David |last2=Suh |date=November 30, 2006 |title=Sediment Pollution |url=http://www3.abe.iastate.edu/tsm424/TSM424TermProj2006/HangslebenSuhFinalPaper.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915085504/http://www3.abe.iastate.edu/tsm424/TSM424TermProj2006/HangslebenSuhFinalPaper.pdf |archivedate=September 15, 2012 }}{{self-published inline|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sedimentation can decrease the transport capacity of ditches, streams, rivers, and navigation channels. It can also limit the amount of light penetrating the water, which affects aquatic biota. The resulting turbidity from sedimentation can interfere with feeding habits of fishes, affecting population dynamics. Sedimentation also affects the transport and accumulation of pollutants, including phosphorus and various pesticides.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Biotic sources==
===Greenhouse gases from fecal waste===
The United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) predicted that 18% of anthropogenic greenhouse gases come directly or indirectly from the world’s livestock. This report also suggested that the emissions from livestock were greater than that of the transportation sector. While livestock do currently play a role in producing greenhouse gas emissions, the estimates have been argued to be a misrepresentation. While the FAO used a life cycle assessment of animal agriculture (i.e. all aspects including emissions from growing crops for feed, transportation to slaughter, etc.), they did not apply the same assessment for the transportation sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1016/S0065-2113(09)03001-6 |chapter=Clearing the Air: Livestock's Contribution to Climate Change |volume=103 |pages=1–40 |title=Advances in Agronomy |year=2009 |last1=Pitesky |first1=Maurice E |last2=Stackhouse |first2=Kimberly R |last3=Mitloehner |first3=Frank M |isbn=978-0-12-374819-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A PNAS model showed that even if animals were completely removed from U.S. agriculture and diets, U.S. GHG emissions would be decreased by 2.6% only (or 28% of agricultural GHG emissions). This is because of the need replace animal manures by fertilizers and to replace also other animal coproducts, and because livestock now use human-inedible food and fiber processing byproducts. Moreover, people would suffer from a greater number of deficiencies in essential nutrients although they would get a greater excess of energy, possibly leading to greater obesity.&lt;ref name=pnas&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/E10301.full|title=Nutritional and greenhouse gas impacts of removing animals from US agriculture|date=Nov 13, 2017|volume=114|issue=48|doi=10.1073/pnas.1707322114|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biopesticides===
[[Biopesticides]] are pesticides derived from natural materials (animals, plants, microorganisms, certain minerals).&lt;ref name="Pedigoand"&gt;L. P. Pedigo, and M. Rice. 2009. Entomology and Pest Management, 6th Edition. Prentice Hall: 816 pp.{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an alternative to traditional pesticides, biopesticides can reduce overall agricultural pollution because they are safe to handle, usually do not strongly affect beneficial invertebrates or vertebrates, and have a short residual time.&lt;ref name="Pedigoand" /&gt; Some concerns exist that biopesticides may have negative impacts on populations of nontarget species, however.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10123-003-0144-x |pmid=12955583 |title=Development, registration and commercialization of microbial pesticides for plant protection |journal=International Microbiology |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=245–52 |year=2003 |last1=Montesinos |first1=Emilio }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, biopesticides are regulated by EPA. Because biopesticides are less harmful and have fewer environmental effects than other pesticides, the agency does not require as much data to register their use. Many biopesticides are permitted under the [[National Organic Program]], [[United States Department of Agriculture]], standards for organic crop production.&lt;ref name="Pedigoand" /&gt;

===Introduced species===
====Invasive species====
{{main|Invasive species}}
[[File:Yellow star thistle.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Yellow Star Thistle.|''[[Centaurea solstitialis]]'', an aggressively invasive weed, was probably introduced to North America in contaminated fodder seed. Agricultural practices such as tilling and livestock grazing aided in its rapid spread. It is toxic to horses, prevents native plants from growing (decreasing biodiversity and degrading natural ecosystems), and is a physical barrier to the migration of indigenous animals.]]
The increasing [[globalization]] of agriculture has resulted in the accidental transport of pests, weeds, and diseases to novel ranges. If they establish, they become an invasive species that can impact populations of native species&lt;ref name="Mooney"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.091093398 |pmid=11344292 |pmc=33232 |title=The evolutionary impact of invasive species |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=98 |issue=10 |pages=5446–51 |year=2001 |last1=Mooney |first1=H. A |last2=Cleland |first2=E. E |bibcode=2001PNAS...98.5446M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and threaten agricultural production.&lt;ref name="Gullan" /&gt; For example, the transport of [[bumble bee]]s reared in Europe and shipped to the United States and/or Canada for use as commercial [[pollinator]]s has led to the introduction of an Old World parasite to the New World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iucnredlist.org/apps/redlist/details/135295/0 |title=Bombus franklini (Franklin's Bumble Bee) |publisher=Iucnredlist.org |date=2008-01-01 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This introduction may play a role in recent native bumble bee declines in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Thorp |first1=R.W. |first2=M.D. |last2=Shepherd |year=2005 |chapter=Profile: Subgenus Bombus Lateille 1802 (Apidae: Apinae: Bombini) |editor1-first=M.D. |editor1-last=Shepherd |editor2-first=D.M. |editor2-last=Vaughan |editor3-first=S.H. |editor3-last=Black |title=Red list of pollinator insects of North America |publisher=Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation |location=Portland, OR }}{{page needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculturally introduced species can also [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ize with native species resulting in a decline in genetic [[biodiversity]] &lt;ref name="Mooney" /&gt; and threaten agricultural production.&lt;ref name="Gullan" /&gt;

Habitat [[disturbance (ecology)]] associated with farming practices themselves can also facilitate the establishment of these introduced organisms. Contaminated machinery, livestock and fodder, and contaminated crop or pasture seed can also lead to the spread of weeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeds.gov.au/management/prevention.htm |title=Weeds in Australia home page |publisher=Weeds.gov.au |date=2013-06-12 |accessdate=2013-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quarantines (see [[biosecurity]] )are one way in which prevention of the spread of invasive species can be regulated at the policy level. A quarantine is a legal instrument that restricts the movement of infested material from areas where an invasive species is present to areas in which it is absent.
The [[World Trade Organization]] has international regulations concerning the quarantine of pests and diseases under the [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures]]. Individual countries often have their own quarantine regulations. In the United States, for example, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]]/[[Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service]] (USDA/APHIS) administers domestic (within the United States) and foreign (importations from outside the United States) quarantines. These quarantines are enforced by inspectors at state borders and ports of entry.&lt;ref name="Pedigoand" /&gt;

====Biological control====
The use of [[biological pest control]] agents, or using predators, [[parasitoid]]s, parasites, and pathogens to control agricultural pests, has the potential to reduce agricultural pollution associated with other pest control techniques, such as pesticide use. The merits of introducing non-native biocontrol agents have been widely debated, however. Once released, the introduction of a biocontrol agent can be irreversible. Potential ecological issues could include the dispersal from agricultural habitats into natural environments, and host-switching or adapting to utilize a native species. In addition, predicting the interaction outcomes in complex ecosystems and potential ecological impacts prior to release can be difficult. One example of a biocontrol program that resulted in ecological damage occurred in North America, where a parasitoid of butterflies was introduced to control [[gypsy moth]] and browntail moth.  This parasitoid is capable of utilizing many butterfly host species, and likely resulted in the decline and extirpation of several native silk moth species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.48.060402.102800 |pmid=12208812 |title=Nontarget effects—the Achilles' heel of biological control? Retrospective analyses to reduce risk associated with biocontrol introductions |journal=Annual Review of Entomology |volume=48 |pages=365–96 |year=2003 |last1=Louda |first1=S.M |last2=Pemberton |first2=R.W |last3=Johnson |first3=M.T |last4=Follett |first4=P.A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

International exploration for potential biocontrol agents is aided by agencies such as the European Biological Control Laboratory, the United States Department of Agriculture/[[Agricultural Research Service]] (USDA/ARS), the Commonwealth Institute of Biological Control, and the [[International Organization for Biological Control]] of Noxious Plants and Animals.  In order to prevent agricultural pollution, quarantine and extensive research on the organism’s potential efficacy and ecological impacts are required prior to introduction. If approved, attempts are made to colonize and disperse the biocontrol agent in appropriate agricultural settings. Continual evaluations on their efficacy are conducted.&lt;ref name="Pedigoand" /&gt;

===Genetically modified organisms (GMO)===
[[File:Bt plants.png|thumb|left|alt= Top: Lesser cornstalk borer larvae extensively damaged the leaves of this unprotected peanut plant. (Image Number K8664-2)-Photo by Herb Pilcher. Bottom: After only a few bites of peanut leaves of this genetically engineered plant (containing the genes of the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) bacteria), this lesser cornstalk borer larva crawled off the leaf and died. (Image Number K8664-1)-Photo by Herb Pilcher.|(Top) Non transgenic peanut leaves showing extensive damage from [[European corn borer]] larvae. (Bottom) Peanut leaves genetically engineered to produce Bt toxins are protected from herbivory damage.]]

====Genetic contamination and ecological effects====
GMO crops can, however, result in genetic contamination of native plant species through hybridization. This could lead to increased weediness of the plant or the extinction of the native species. In addition, the [[transgenic]] plant itself may become a weed if the modification improves its fitness in a given environment.&lt;ref name="Gullan" /&gt;

There are also concerns that non-target organisms, such as [[pollinator]]s and natural enemies, could be poisoned by accidental ingestion of Bt-producing plants. A recent study testing the effects of Bt corn pollen dusting nearby milkweed plants on larval feeding of the [[monarch butterfly]] found that the threat to populations of the monarch was low.&lt;ref name="Gullan" /&gt;

The use of GMO crop plants engineered for [[herbicide resistance]] can also indirectly increase the amount of agricultural pollution associated with [[herbicide]] use. For example, the increased use of herbicide in herbicide-resistant corn fields in the mid-western United States is decreasing the amount of milkweeds available for [[monarch butterfly]] larvae.&lt;ref name="Gullan" /&gt;

[[Regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms]] vary based on the type of organism and the country concerned.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====GMO as a tool of pollution reduction====
While there may be some concerns regarding the use of GM products, it may also be the solution to some of the existing animal agriculture pollution issues.  One of the main sources of pollution, particularly vitamin and mineral drift in soils, comes from a lack of digestive efficiency in animals.  By improving digestive efficiency, it is possible to minimize both the cost of animal production and the environmental damage.  One successful example of this technology and its potential application is the [[Enviropig]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The [[Enviropig]] is a genetically modified Yorkshire pig that expresses [[phytase]] in its saliva. Grains, such as corn and wheat, have phosphorus that is bound in a naturally indigestible form known as phytic acid. [[Phosphorus]], an essential nutrient for pigs, is then added to the diet, since it can not be broken down in the pigs digestive tract.  As a result, nearly all of the phosphorus naturally found in the grain is wasted in the feces, and can contribute to elevated levels in the soil. Phytase is an enzyme that is able to break down the otherwise indigestible phytic acid, making it available to the pig. The ability of the Enviropig to digest the phosphorus from the grains eliminates the waste of that natural phosphorus (20-60% reduction), while also eliminating the need to supplement the nutrient in feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/90788 |pmid=11479566 |year=2001 |last1=Golovan |first1=Serguei P |title=Pigs expressing salivary phytase produce low-phosphorus manure |journal=Nature Biotechnology |volume=19 |issue=8 |pages=741–5 |last2=Meidinger |first2=Roy G |last3=Ajakaiye |first3=Ayodele |last4=Cottrill |first4=Michael |last5=Wiederkehr |first5=Miles Z |last6=Barney |first6=David J |last7=Plante |first7=Claire |last8=Pollard |first8=John W |last9=Fan |first9=Ming Z |last10=Hayes |first10=M.

===Animal management===
====Manure management====
{{main|Manure management}}
One of the main contributors to air, soil and [[water pollution]] is animal waste. According to a 2005 report by the USDA, more than 335 million tons of "dry matter" waste (the waste after water is removed) is produced annually on farms in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;USDA Agricultural Research Service. "FY-2005 Annual Report Manure and Byproduct Utilization", 31 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[Animal feeding operation]]s produce about 100 times more manure than the amount of human sewage sludge processed in US municipal waste water plants each year. Diffuse source pollution from agricultural fertilizers is more difficult to trace, monitor and control. High nitrate concentrations are found in groundwater and may reach 50&amp;nbsp;mg/litre (the EU Directive limit). In ditches and river courses, [[nutrient pollution]] from fertilizers causes eutrophication. This is worse in winter, after autumn ploughing has released a surge of nitrates; winter rainfall is heavier increasing runoff and leaching, and there is lower plant uptake. EPA suggests that one dairy farm with 2,500 cows produces as much waste as a city with around 411,000 residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=May 2004 |title=Risk Management Evaluation for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=901V0100.txt |publisher=EPA |location=Cincinnati, OH |page=7 |id=EPA 600/R-04/042}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Research Council (United States)|US National Research Council]] has identified odors as the most significant animal emission problem at the local level. Different animal systems have adopted several waste management procedures to deal with the large amount of waste produced annually.

The advantages of manure treatment are a reduction in the amount of manure that needs to be transported and applied to crops, as well as reduced soil compaction. Nutrients are reduced as well, meaning that less cropland is needed for manure to be spread upon. Manure treatment can also reduce the risk of human health and biosecurity risks by reducing the amount of pathogens present in manure. Undiluted animal manure or slurry is one hundred times more concentrated than domestic sewage, and can carry an intestinal parasite, ''[[Cryptosporidium]],'' which is difficult to detect but can be passed to humans. [[Silage]] liquor (from fermented wet grass) is even stronger than slurry, with a low pH and very high biological oxygen demand. With a low pH, silage liquor can be highly corrosive; it can attack synthetic materials, causing damage to storage equipment, and leading to accidental spillage. All of these advantages can be optimized by using the right manure management system on the right farm based on the resources that are available.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Manure treatment====
=====Composting=====
[[Compost#Animal manure and bedding|Composting]] is a solid manure management system that relies on solid manure from bedded pack pens, or the solids from a liquid manure separator. There are two methods of composting, active and passive. Manure is churned periodically during active composting, whereas in passive composting it is not. Passive composting has been found to have lower green house gas emissions due to incomplete decomposition and lower gas diffusion rates.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

=====Solid-liquid separation=====
Manure can be mechanically separated into a solid and liquid portion for easier management. Liquids (4-8% dry matter) can be used easily in pump systems for convenient spread over crops and the solid fraction (15-30% dry matter) can be used as stall bedding, spread on crops, composted or exported.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

=====Anaerobic digestion and lagoons=====
[[File:Anaerobic Lagoon at Cal Poly.jpg|thumb|Anaerobic lagoon at a dairy]]
[[Anaerobic digestion]] is the biological treatment of liquid animal waste using bacteria in an area absent of air, which promotes the decomposition of organic solids.  Hot water is used to heat the waste in order to increase the rate of biogas production.&lt;ref name="manuremanagement.cornell"/&gt; The remaining liquid is nutrient rich and can be used on fields as a fertilizer and methane gas that can be burned directly on the biogas stove&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2017.08.068 |title=Current approach to manure management for small-scale Southeast Asian farmers - Using Vietnamese biogas and non-biogas farms as an example |journal=Renewable Energy |volume=115 |pages=362–70 |year=2018 |last1=Roubík |first1=Hynek |last2=Mazancová |first2=Jana |last3=Phung |first3=Le Dinh |last4=Banout |first4=Jan }}&lt;/ref&gt; or in an engine generator to produce electricity and heat.&lt;ref name="manuremanagement.cornell"&gt;{{cite report |date=2005-04-12 |title=Evaluating the Need for a Manure Treatment System |series=Fact Sheet |url=http://www.manuremanagement.cornell.edu/Pages/General_Docs/Fact_Sheets/Evaluating_Need_for_Manure_Treatment_System_factsheet.pdf |publisher=Cornell University Manure Management Program |location=Ithaca, NY |id=MT-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=July 1999 |title=Animal Agriculture: Waste Management Practices |url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1999/rc99205.pdf |publisher=U.S. General Accounting Office |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=9–11 |id=GAO/RCED-99-205}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methane is about 20 times more potent as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, which has significant negative environmental effects if not controlled properly.  Anaerobic treatment of waste is the best method for controlling the odor associated with manure management.&lt;ref name="manuremanagement.cornell" /&gt;

[[Anaerobic lagoon|Biological treatment lagoons]] also use anaerobic digestion to break down solids, but at a much slower rate.  Lagoons are kept at ambient temperatures as opposed to the heated digestion tanks.  Lagoons require large land areas and high dilution volumes to work properly, so they do not work well in many climates in the northern United States. Lagoons also offer the benefit of reduced odor and biogas is made available for heat and electric power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=September 2002 |title=Anaerobic Lagoons |series=Wastewater Technology Fact Sheet |url=https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/alagoons.pdf |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 832-F-02-009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have demonstrated that GHG emissions are reduced using aerobic digestion systems. GHG emission reductions and credits can help compensate for the higher installation cost of cleaner aerobic technologies and facilitate producer adoption of environmentally superior technologies to replace current anaerobic lagoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2007.09.034 |pmid=18060761 |title=Greenhouse gas emission reduction and environmental quality improvement from implementation of aerobic waste treatment systems in swine farms |journal=Waste Management |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=759–66 |year=2008 |last1=Vanotti |first1=M.B |last2=Szogi |first2=A.A |last3=Vives |first3=C.A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alessandro Longo''' (31 December 1864 – 3 November 1945) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[composer]] and [[musicology|musicologist]].

==Early life==
Longo was born in [[Amantea]]. After studying at the [[Music conservatories of Naples|Naples Conservatory]] under [[Beniamino Cesi]] (and composition under [[Paolo Serrao]]), he began teaching [[piano]] at his [[alma mater]] in 1887, deputizing for Cesi as pianoforte professor, and succeeded him in 1897.

==Career==
As a pianist, Longo often played in chamber ensemble with the Ferni Quartet, and with the Quartetto Napoletano (with Cantani, Parmiciano, Scarano and Viterbini). He founded various musical institutions in Naples, and gained a high reputation as a concert pianist. In 1914 he began editing the review ''L'Arte Pianistica''.&lt;ref&gt;This paragraph derived from [[Arthur Eaglefield Hull]], ''A Dictionary of Modern Music and Musicians'' (Dent, London 1924), 87, 303-304.&lt;/ref&gt; He became Director of the Naples Conservatory in 1944, and died in [[Naples]] the following year, aged 80.

==Legacy==
Today, Longo is mainly remembered for compiling an almost comprehensive catalogue of the [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] works of [[Domenico Scarlatti]].  For many years, [[List of solo keyboard sonatas by Domenico Scarlatti|Scarlatti's keyboard sonatas]] were conventionally identified by their Longo numbers, but these were later superseded by those found in [[Ralph Kirkpatrick]]'s catalogue. Longo's Catalogue originated in his landmark full publication of the works of Scarlatti in 11 volumes&lt;ref&gt;A. Longo, ''545 Scarlatti Sonatas in XI Volumes'' (Ricordi, 1906-1913).&lt;/ref&gt; and implied particular groupings of the sonatas, the chronology of which was later completely revised and differently grouped in Kirkpatrick's 1953 study of the composer.&lt;ref&gt;R. Kirkpatrick, ''Domenico Scarlatti'' (Princeton University Press, 1953).&lt;/ref&gt; Longo also edited works by [[Domenico Gallo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Permanent Link to Catalog Card Entry for Gallo Sonata, attributed to Pergolesi, as Arranged by Longo|publisher=Cornell University|url=https://catalog.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=2004985&amp;DB=local|accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His compositions include, among others, two works for piano four-hands, a serenade and a suite;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McGraw|first=Cameron|title=Piano Duet Repertoire: Music Originally Written for One Piano, Four Hands|year=1981|pages=174|isbn=0-253-21461-0|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|

==Family life==

{{As of|2016|8}}, neither the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy]] nor the [[International Union of Geological Sciences]] has yet officially approved the term as a recognized subdivision of [[Geologic time scale|geological time]],&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Subcomission on Quaternary Stratigraphy, ICS » Working Groups |url = http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/workinggroups/anthropocene/ |website = quaternary.stratigraphy.org |accessdate = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gixmodo001" /&gt; although the Anthropocene Working Group (AWG) of the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy (SQS) of the [[International Commission on Stratigraphy|International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS)]], voted to proceed towards a formal [[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point|golden spike (GSSP)]] proposal to define the Anthropocene epoch in the [[Geologic time scale|Geologic Time Scale]] and presented the recommendation to the [[International Geological Congress]] on 29 August 2016.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/29/declare-anthropocene-epoch-experts-urge-geological-congress-human-impact-earth |title= The Anthropocene epoch: scientists declare dawn of human-influenced age|first= Damian |last= Carrington|date= 29 August 2016|work= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= August 29, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various different start dates for the Anthropocene have been proposed, ranging from the beginning of the [[Neolithic Revolution|Agricultural Revolution]] 12,000–15,000 years ago, to as recent as the [[Trinity test]] in 1945. {{As of|2018|02}}, the ratification process continues and thus a date remains to be decided definitively, but the latter date has been more favored than others.

The most recent period of the Anthropocene has been referred to by several authors as the [[Great Acceleration]] during which the socioeconomic and earth system trends are increasing dramatically, especially after the [[Second World War]]. For instance, the [[Geological Society]] termed the year 1945 as ''The Great Acceleration''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/anthropocene|title=The Anthropocene|publisher=The Geological Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
An early concept for the Anthropocene was the [[Noosphere]] by [[Vladimir Vernadsky]], who in 1938 wrote of "scientific thought as a geological force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://action.larouchepac.com/_the_anthropocene|title='The Anthropocene' viewed from Vernadsky's Noosphere|date=29 February 2016|publisher=Larouche Pac}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists in the [[Soviet Union]] appear to have used the term "anthropocene" as early as the 1960s to refer to the [[Quaternary]], the most recent [[Period (geology)|geological period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= Akademii͡a nauk SSSR|title= Doklady: Biological sciences sections, Volumes 132-135}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=June 2018|reason=URL?

Stoermer]] subsequently used "anthropocene" with a different sense in the 1980s&lt;ref name="revkin2011"&gt;{{cite web|last= Revkin|first= Andrew C.|title= Confronting the 'Anthropocene'|url= http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/confronting-the-anthropocene/|work= New York Times|accessdate= 25 March 2014|date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the term was widely popularized in 2000 by [[Atmospheric chemistry|atmospheric chemist]] [[Paul J. Crutzen]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Dawson|first= Ashley|authorlink = Ashley Dawson |title= Extinction: A Radical History|date= 2016|publisher= [[OR Books]]|url= http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/extinction-by-ashley-dawson/|page= 19 |isbn= 978-1944869014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who regards the influence of human behavior on Earth's atmosphere in recent centuries as so significant as to constitute a new [[geological epoch]].

In 2008, the Stratigraphy Commission of the [[Geological Society of London]] considered a proposal to  make the Anthropocene a formal unit of geological epoch divisions.&lt;ref name="Edwards"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zalasiewicz08"&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Zalasiewicz |first= Jan |title = Are we now living in the Anthropocene? |journal = [[GSA Today]] |volume = 18 |issue = 2 |pages= 4–8 |year = 2008 |url = http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/18/2/pdf/i1052-5173-18-2-4.pdf |doi = 10.1130/GSAT01802A.1|display-authors= etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of the commission decided the proposal had merit and should be examined further. Independent working groups of scientists from various geological societies have begun to determine whether the Anthropocene will be formally accepted into the [[Geologic time scale|Geological Time Scale]].&lt;ref name="Zalasiewicz10"&gt;{{Cite journal |author = Zalasiewicz, J. |title = The New World of the Anthropocene |journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology |volume = 44 |issue = 7 |pages= 2228–2231 |date = 2010 |url = http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es903118j |doi = 10.1021/es903118j |bibcode = 2010EnST...44.2228Z |display-authors= etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{Human timeline}}{{Life timeline}}
The name ''Anthropocene'' is a combination of ''[[wikt:anthropo-#English|anthropo-]]'' from ''anthropos'' ({{lang-grc|ἄνθρωπος}}) meaning "human" and ''[[wikt:-cene#English|-cene]]'' from ''kainos'' ({{lang-grc|καινός}}) meaning "new" or "recent."&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a)/nqrwpos|ἄνθρωπος}}, {{LSJ|kaino/s|καινός|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|-cene}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1873, the Italian geologist [[Antonio Stoppani]] acknowledged the increasing power and effect of humanity on the Earth's systems and referred to an 'anthropozoic era'.&lt;ref name="Crutzen02"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Crutzen | first=P. J. | title=Geology of mankind | journal=Nature | volume=415 | date=2002 | page=23 | url=http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038%2F415023a | doi=10.1038/415023a | pmid=11780095 | issue=6867|bibcode = 2002Natur.415...23C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the biologist [[Eugene Stoermer]] is often credited with coining the term "anthropocene", it was in informal use in the mid-1970s. [[Paul Crutzen]] is credited with independently re-inventing and popularizing it. Stoermer wrote, "I began using the term 'anthropocene' in the 1980's, but never formalized it until Paul contacted me."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steffen |first=Will |last2=Grinevald |first2=Jacques |last3=Crutzen |first3=Paul |last4=McNeill |first4=John |date=2011 |title=The Anthropocene: conceptual and historical perspectives |url=ftp://ftp.iluci.org/Evan/GEOG415/Reading_Assignments/Anthropocene.pdf |journal=Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A |volume=369 |page=843 |accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crutzen has explained, "I was at a conference where someone said something about the [[Holocene]]. I suddenly thought this was wrong. The world has changed too much. So I said: 'No, we are in the Anthropocene.' I just made up the word on the spur of the moment. Everyone was shocked. But it seems to have stuck."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pearce |first=Fred |author-link=Fred Pearce |title=With Speed and Violence: Why Scientists fear tipping points in Climate Change |publisher=Beacon Press |location=Boston, Massachusetts |date=2007 |isbn=978-0-8070-8576-9 |url=http://www.gci.org.uk/Documents/wsav.pdf |access-date=5 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21}} In 2008, Zalasiewicz suggested in ''[[GSA Today]]'' that an anthropocene [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]] is now appropriate.&lt;ref name="Zalasiewicz08"/&gt;

===Homogenocene===
'''Homogenocene''' (from old Greek: [[wikt:Homo-#English|homo-]], ''same'' [[wikt:geno-#English|geno-]], ''kind'', '''kainos-''', ''new'' and [[wikt:-cene#English|-cene]], ''period'') is a more specific term used to define our current [[Geologic time scale|geological]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]], in which [[#Biodiversity|biodiversity]] is diminishing and [[#Biogeography|biogeography]] and [[ecosystems]] around the globe seem more and more similar to one another mainly due to [[invasive species]] that have been introduced around the globe either on purpose (crops, livestock) or inadvertently.

The term Homogenocene was first used by Michael Samways in his editorial article in the ''Journal of Insect Conservation'' from 1999 titled "Translocating fauna to foreign lands: here comes the Homogenocene."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

One geological symptom resulting from human activity is increasing [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] [[carbon dioxide]] (CO{{sub|2}}) content. During the [[ice age|glacial–interglacial]] cycles of the past million years, natural processes have varied CO{{sub|2}} by approximately 100 [[Parts per million|ppm]] (from 180 ppm to 280 ppm). {{As of|2013}}, anthropogenic net emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increased atmospheric concentration by a comparable amount from 280 ppm (Holocene or pre-industrial "equilibrium") to approximately 400 ppm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/global.html|title=ESRL Global Monitoring Division - Global Greenhouse Gas Reference Network|author=ESRL Web Team|work=noaa.gov|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 2015&amp;ndash;16 monthly monitoring data of CO{{sub|2}} displaying a rising trend above 400 ppm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/|title=NASA Global Climate Change - Vital Signs of the Planet - Facts - Carbon Dioxide|date=7 November 2016|accessdate=10 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This signal in the Earth's climate system is especially significant because it is occurring much faster,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5314592.stm|date=4 September 2006|title=Deep ice tells long climate story|work=BBC News|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to a greater extent, than previous, similar changes. Most of this increase is due to the [[combustion]] of [[fossil fuel]]s such as [[coal]], [[Petroleum|oil]], and [[Natural gas|gas]], although smaller fractions are the result of [[cement]] production and land-use changes (e.g. [[deforestation]]).

===Geomorphology===
Changes in drainage patterns traceable to human activity will persist over geologic time in large parts of the continents where the geologic regime is erosional.  This includes the paths of roads and highways defined by their grading and drainage control. Direct changes to the form of the Earth's surface by human activities (e.g., quarrying, landscaping) also record human impacts.

It has been suggested the deposition of [[calthemite]] formations are one example of a natural process which has not previously occurred prior to the human modification of the Earth's surface, and therefore represents a unique process of the Anthropocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dixon|first=Simon J|last2=Viles|first2=Heather A|last3=Garrett|first3=Bradley L|title=Ozymandias in the Anthropocene: the city as an emerging landform|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/area.12358/abstract|date=21 June 2017|journal=Area|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1111/area.12358|issn=1475-4762}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calthemite is a secondary deposit, derived from [[concrete]], [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] or other calcareous material ''outside the [[cave]] environment''.&lt;ref name=SmithGK2016&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=G.

===Stratigraphy===

====Sedimentological record====
Human activities like deforestation and road construction are believed to have elevated average total sediment fluxes across the Earth's surface.&lt;ref name="Science2016" /&gt; However, construction of dams on many rivers around the world means the rates of sediment deposition in any given place do not always appear to increase in the Anthropocene. For instance, many [[river delta]]s around the world are actually currently starved of sediment by such dams, and are subsiding and failing to keep up with sea level rise, rather than growing.&lt;ref name="Science2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Giosan|first1=L.|last2=Syvitski|first2=J. P. M.|last3=Constantinescu|first3=S.|last4=Day|first4=J.|date=3 December 2014|title=Climate change: Protect the world's deltas|work=Nature|volume=516|pages=31–33|doi=10.1038/516031a|bibcode=2014Natur.516...31G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fossil record====
Increases in erosion due to farming and other operations will be reflected by changes in sediment composition and increases in deposition rates elsewhere. In land areas with a depositional regime, engineered structures will tend to be buried and preserved, along with litter and debris. Litter and debris thrown from boats or carried by rivers and creeks will accumulate in the marine environment, particularly in coastal areas. Such manmade artifacts preserved in stratigraphy are known as "technofossils."&lt;ref name="Science2016" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first1=H.V.|last1=Cabadas-Báez|first2=S.|last2=Sedov|first3=S|last3=Jiménez-Álvarez|first4=D|last4=Leonard|first5=B.|last5=Lailson-Tinoco|first6=R.|last6=García-Moll|first7=I.|last7=Ancona-Aragón|first8=L.|last8=Hernández|date=2017|title=Soils as a source of raw materials for ancient ceramic production in the Maya region of Mexico: Micromorphological insight|url=http://boletinsgm.igeolcu.unam.mx/bsgm/vols/epoca04/7001/%282%29Cabadas.pdf|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana|volume=70|issue=1|pages=21–48|doi=10.18268/BSGM2018v70n1a2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in biodiversity will also be reflected in the fossil record, as will species introductions.  An example cited is the domestic chicken, originally the [[red junglefowl]] ''Gallus gallus'', native to south-east Asia but has since become the world's most common bird through human breeding and consumption, with over 60 billion consumed a year and whose bones would become fossilized in landfill sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/aug/31/domestic-chicken-anthropocene-humanity-influenced-epoch |title=How the domestic chicken rose to define the Anthropocene |first=Damian |last=Carrington|date= 31 August 2016 |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trace elements====
In terms of trace elements, there are distinct signatures left by modern societies. For example, in the [[Upper Fremont Glacier]] in Wyoming, there is a layer of [[chlorine]] present in ice cores from 1960's atomic weapon testing programs, as well as a layer of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] associated with [[coal]] plants in the 1980s. From 1945 to 1951, [[nuclear fallout]] is found locally around atomic device test sites, whereas from 1952 to 1980, tests of [[thermonuclear]] devices have left a clear, global signal of excess {{SimpleNuclide2|carbon|14}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|plutonium|239}}, and other artificial [[radionuclide]]s. The highest global concentration of radionuclides was in 1965, one of the dates which has been proposed as a possible benchmark for the start of the formally defined Anthropocene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global peak in atmospheric radiocarbon provides a potential definition for the onset of the Anthropocene Epoch in 1965|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-20970-5|website=[[Scientific Reports]]|accessdate=1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human burning of [[fossil fuel]]s has also left distinctly elevated concentrations of black carbon, inorganic ash, and spherical carbonaceous particles in recent sediments across the world. Concentrations of these components increases markedly and almost simultaneously around the world beginning around 1950.&lt;ref name="Science2016" /&gt;

== Temporal limit ==
The Anthropocene Working Group voted on the "Base/beginning of the Anthropocene", and most members favored some time around 1950.&lt;ref name="guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/press/press-releases/2016/august/media-note-anthropocene-working-group-awg|title=Media note: Anthropocene Working Group (AWG)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=University of Leicester|access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This time period has also been referred to as the [[Great Acceleration]].

==="Early anthropocene" model ===
{{Main|Early anthropocene}}
While much of the environmental change occurring on Earth is suspected to be a direct consequence of the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[William Ruddiman]] has argued that the proposed Anthropocene began approximately 8,000 years ago with the development of farming and sedentary cultures. At this point, humans were dispersed across all of the continents (except [[Antarctica]]), and the [[Neolithic Revolution]] was ongoing. During this period, humans developed [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]] to supplement or replace [[hunter-gatherer]] subsistence. Such innovations were followed by a wave of [[extinction]]s, beginning with large [[mammal]]s and land [[bird]]s. This wave was driven by both the direct activity of humans (e.g. hunting) and the indirect consequences of land-use change for agriculture.

From the past to present, some authors consider the Anthropocene and the Holocene to be the same or coeval geologic time span,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The onset of the Anthropocene |author= Smith, B.

Furthermore, the argument that "something" is needed to explain the differences in the Holocene is challenged by more recent research showing that all interglacials differ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v2/n11/abs/ngeo660.html|title=Interglacial diversity |accessdate=28 November 2015|volume=2|doi=10.1038/ngeo660|pages=751–755|journal=Nature Geoscience|bibcode=2009NatGe...2..751T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquity===
A plausible starting point of the Anthropocene could be at ''ca.'' 2,000 years ago,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} which roughly coincides with the start of the final phase of [[Holocene]], the [[Subatlantic]].&lt;ref name="Certini01"&gt;{{cite journal |title= Anthropogenic soils are the golden spikes for the Anthropocene |author= Certini, G. |author2= Scalenghe, R. |last-author-amp= yes |date= 2011 |doi= 10.1177/0959683611408454|journal= The Holocene|volume= 21 |issue= 8 |pages= 1269–1274|bibcode= 2011Holoc..21.1269C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, the [[Roman Empire]] encompassed large portions of [[Europe]], the Middle East, and North Africa. In [[China]] the [[Han Dynasty|classical dynasties]] were flowering. The [[Middle kingdoms of India]] had already the [[largest economy]] of the ancient and medieval world. The Napata/Meroitic kingdom extended over the current [[Sudan]] and [[Ethiopia]]. The [[Olmec]]s controlled central [[Mexico]] and [[Guatemala]], and the pre-Incan Chavín people managed areas of northern [[Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/world-history-beginnings/ancient-americas/a/andean-and-chavn-civilizations-article|title=Andean and Chavín civilizations|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although often apart from each other and intermixed with buffering ecosystems, the areas directly impacted by these civilizations and others were large. Additionally, some activities, such as mining, implied much more widespread perturbation of natural conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Greenland ice evidence of hemispheric lead pollution two millennia ago by Greek and Roman civilizations |author= Hong, S. |author2= Candelone, J-P. |author3= Patterson, C.

They have taken advantage of global environmental conditions not of their own making.The end of the [[last glacial period]] – when as much as 30% of Earth's surface was ice-bound – led to a warmer world with more water ({{H2O}}). Although humans existed in the previous Pleistocene epoch, it is only in the recent Holocene period that they have flourished. Today there are more humans alive than at any previous point in Earth's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Castree|first=Noel|year=2015|title=The anthropocene: a primer for geographers|url=https://2017.moodle.maynoothuniversity.ie/pluginfile.php/487483/mod_resource/content/1/Castree%20The%20Anthropocene.pdf|journal=geography|volume= 100|pages=66|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial Revolution===
Crutzen proposed the [[Industrial Revolution]] as the start of Anthropocene.&lt;ref name="Crutzen02" /&gt; Lovelock proposes that the Anthropocene began with the first application of the [[Newcomen atmospheric engine]] in 1712. The [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] takes the pre-industrial era (chosen as the year 1750) as the baseline related to changes in long-lived, well mixed greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html|title=NOAA/ESRL Global Monitoring Division - THE NOAA ANNUAL GREENHOUSE GAS INDEX (AGGI)|last=Laboratory|first=US Department of Commerce, NOAA, Earth System Research|website=www.esrl.noaa.gov|language=EN-US|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is apparent that the Industrial Revolution ushered in an unprecedented global human impact on the planet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Industry, environment and health through 200 years in Manchester |author= Douglas, I. |author2= Hodgson, R. |author3= Lawson, N. |last-author-amp= yes |year= 2002 |doi= 10.1016/S0921-8009(02)00029-0 |journal= Ecological Economics |volume= 41 |issue= 2 |pages= 235–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; much of Earth's landscape already had been profoundly modified by human activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Holocene record |author= Kirch, P.

=== Anthropocene marker ===
A marker that accounts for a substantial global impact of humans on the total environment, comparable in scale to those associated with significant perturbations of the geological past, is needed in place of minor changes in atmosphere composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Response to 'The Anthropocene forces us to reconsider adaptationist models of human-environment interactions' |author= Zalasiewicz, J. |author2= Williams, M. |author3= Steffen, W. |author4= Crutzen, P.

A useful candidate for this purpose is the [[pedosphere]], which can retain information of its climatic and geochemical history with features lasting for centuries or millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Humanity's transformation of Earth's soil: pedology's new frontier |author= Richter, D. deB. |year= 2007 |doi= 10.1097/ss.0b013e3181586bb7 |journal= Soil Science |volume= 172 |issue= 12 |pages= 957–967|bibcode= 2007SoilS.172..957R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Human activity is now firmly established as the sixth factor of soil formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= The place of humans in the state factor theory of ecosystems and their soils |author= Amundson, R. |author2= Jenny, H. |last-author-amp= yes |date= 1991 |journal= Soil Science |volume= 151 |issue= 1 |pages= 99–109 |doi=10.1097/00010694-199101000-00012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It affects pedogenesis either directly, by, for example, land levelling, trenching and embankment building for various purposes, organic matter enrichment from additions of manure or other waste, organic matter impoverishment due to continued cultivation, compaction from overgrazing or, indirectly, by drift of eroded materials or pollutants. Anthropogenic soils are those markedly affected by human activities, such as repeated ploughing, the addition of fertilizers, contamination, sealing, or enrichment with artefacts (in the [[World Reference Base for Soil Resources]] they are classified as [[Anthrosols]] and [[Technosols]]). They are recalcitrant repositories of artefacts and properties that testify to the dominance of the human impact, and hence appear to be reliable markers for the Anthropocene. Some anthropogenic soils may be viewed as the 'golden spikes' of geologists ([[Global Boundary Stratotype Section and Point]]), which are locations where there are strata successions with clear evidences of a worldwide event, including the appearance of distinctive fossils.&lt;ref name="Certini01" /&gt; Drilling for fossil fuels has also created holes and tubes which are expected to be detectable for millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldofideas.wbur.org/2015/03/29/mcneill|title=The Advent of the Anthropocene: Was That the Big Story of the 20th Century?|work=worldofideas|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In culture==
The concept of the Anthropocene has also been approached via humanities such as philosophy, literature and art. In the scholarly world, it has been the subject of increasing attention through special journal issues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| volume = 34| issue = 2| editor = Timothy Clark| title = Special Issue: Deconstruction in the Anthropocene| journal = Oxford Literary Review| accessdate = 21 July 2014| date = 1 December 2012| url = http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/olr.2012.0039| doi=10.3366/olr.2012.0039| pages=v–vi}}&lt;/ref&gt; conferences,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| author = Humanities Research Centre, Australian National University| title = Anthropocene Humanities: The 2012 Annual Meeting of the Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes| location = Canberra, Australia| accessdate = 21 July 2014| date = 13 June 2012| url = http://chcinetwork.org/anthropocene-humanities/| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140831221523/http://chcinetwork.org/anthropocene-humanities/| archivedate = 31 August 2014| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference| author = Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society at LMU-Munich| last2 = Alexander von Humboldt Transatlantic Network in the Environmental Humanities| title = Culture and the Anthropocene| location = Munich, Germany| accessdate = 21 July 2014| date = 14 June 2013| url = http://www.carsoncenter.uni-muenchen.de/events_conf_seminars/event_history/2013/2013_conf_ws_sem/130614_cult_anthrop/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and disciplinary reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = American Comparative Literature Association| last = Wenzel| first = Jennifer| title = State of the Discipline Report: Ideas of the Decade| chapter = Climate Change| accessdate = 21 July 2014| date = 13 March 2014| chapterurl = http://stateofthediscipline.acla.org/entry/climate-change}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anthropocene, its attendant timescale, and ecological implications prompts questions about death and the ends of civilization,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Scranton| first = Roy| title = Learning How to Die in the Anthropocene| work = New York Times: Opinionator| accessdate = 17 July 2014| date = 10 November 2013| url = http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/learning-how-to-die-in-the-anthropocene/}}&lt;/ref&gt; memory and archives,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Colebrook| first = Claire| title = The Anthropocene and the Archive| work = The Memory Network: Exchanges| accessdate = 21 July 2014| date = 27 January 2014| url = http://thememorynetwork.net/the-anthropocene-and-the-archive/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the scope and methods of humanistic inquiry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Nowviskie| first = Bethany| title = digital humanities in the anthropocene| work = nowviskie.org| accessdate = 10 July 2014| date = 10 July 2014| url = http://nowviskie.org/2014/anthropocene/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emotional responses to the "end of nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Ronda| first = Margaret| title = Mourning and Melancholia in the Anthropocene| journal = Post45| accessdate = 21 July 2014| date = 10 June 2013| url = http://post45.research.yale.edu/2013/06/mourning-and-melancholia-in-the-anthropocene/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been also criticized as an ideological construct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Andreas|last=Malm|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/03/anthropocene-capitalism-climate-change/|title=The Anthropocene Myth|magazine=[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some environmentalists on the political left suggest that "Capitalocene" is a more historically appropriate term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anthropocene or Capitalocene?

'''Applied Maths''' NV is a [[bioinformatics]] company, headquartered in [[Sint-Martens-Latem]], [[Belgium]], developing software for the biosciences.

==History==

Applied Maths was founded in 1992 and gained worldwide recognition with the software GelCompar, used as a standard tool for the normalization and comparative analysis of [[electrophoresis]] patterns ([[PFGE]], [[Amplified fragment length polymorphism|AFLP]], [[RAPD]], REP-PCR and variants, …)
&lt;ref&gt;Dijkshoorn L., Towner K. J., Struelens M., 2001. New approaches for the generation and analysis of microbial typing data. Elsevier, {{ISBN|0-444-50740-X}}, {{ISBN|978-0-444-50740-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
.&lt;ref&gt;Vauterin L. and P. Vauterin. 1992. Computer-aided objective comparison of electrophoresis patterns for grouping and identification of microorganisms. Eur. Microbiol. 1:37-41.&lt;/ref&gt;

GelCompar II was released in 1998 to deal with the ever growing amounts of information following the success and expansion of electrophoresis and other fingerprinting techniques in various application fields in [[microbiology]], [[virology]] and [[mycology]]. Following the introduction of the concepts of polyphasic taxonomy &lt;ref&gt;[http://mmbr.asm.org/content/60/2/407.full.pdf+html] Vandamme et al., Polyphasic taxonomy, a consensus approach to bacterial systematics. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. June 1996 vol. 60 no. 2 407-438.&lt;/ref&gt; and the growing need to combine [[genotypic]], [[phenotypic]], electrophoresis and sequence information, Applied Maths released in 1996 the software package [[BioNumerics]] which still today is a platform for the management, storage and (statistical) analysis of all types of biological data.&lt;ref&gt;Vauterin L, Vauterin P. Integrated databasing and analysis. In: Molecular Identification, Systematics, and Population Structure of Prokaryotes (ed. Erko Stackebrandt). Springer, 2006. {{ISBN|978-3-540-23155-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; BioNumerics and GelCompar II are used by several networks around the globe, such as [[Pulsenet]] and Calicinet, to share and identify strain information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hunter SB, Vauterin P, Lambert-Fair MA, Van Duyne MS, Kubota K, Graves L, Wrigley D, Barrett T, Ribot E | title= Establishment of a universal size standard strain for use with the PulseNet standardized pulsed-field gel electrophoresis protocols: converting the national databases to the new size standard.  |journal= J.

In January 2016, Applied Maths was acquired by [[bioMérieux]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biomerieux.com/en/biomerieux-acquires-applied-maths-and-enhances-its-bioinformatics-capabilities-cutting-edge bioMérieux acquires Applied Maths and enhances its bioinformatics capabilities with cutting-edge expertise and solutions for the smart use of complex biological data]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==

'''[[BioNumerics]]''': BioNumerics is a commercial suite of 10 software modules, used for the analysis of all major applications in bioinformatics: [[gel electrophoresis|1D electrophoresis gels]], [[Chromatography|chromatographic]] and [[Mass spectrometry|spectrometric]] profiles, [[phenotype]] characters, [[microarray]]s, [[sequence]]s, etc.

'''GelCompar II''': GelCompar II is a suite of 5 modules developed for the analysis of fingerprint patterns, covering the normalization, import into a relational database and the comparative analysis.

'''BNServer''': BNserver is the web-based platform generally installed between a centrally maintained database and distributed clients using BioNumerics, GelCompar II or a web browser to exchange biological information and analysis results. BNServer has been used since the nineties in Food outbreak detection.

==History==
Bakeys was founded by Narayana Peesapathy in 2010 in Hyderabad. In April 2016, it earned a crowd-funding of around {{INRconvert|25|l}} from 1500+ backers through Ketto with its initial goal being only {{INRconvert|1|l}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.ketto.org/bakeys|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=| website=Ketto| publisher=|access-date=31 May 2016|title=Eat Your Spoon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this support, the company started a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to increase its reach.&lt;ref name="ZME 2016"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.zmescience.com/ecology/environmental-issues/bakeys-spoon-53749/|last1=Micu|first1=Alexandra|last2=|first2=|date=30 March 2016| website=ZME Science| publisher=|access-date=31 May 2016|title=India’s Bakey edible spoon does two of my favorite things: limits dishes and plastic waste}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1240116767/edible-cutlery-the-future-of-eco-friendly-utensils/description|last1=|first1=|last2=|first2=|date=April 2016| website=[[Kickstarter]]| publisher=|access-date=31 May 2016|title=Edible Cutlery: The Future of Eco Friendly Utensils}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2016, the company had 30 employees.&lt;ref name="TET 2016"/&gt; As of May 2017 the company had not yet started shipping to backers of the Kickstarter, though shipments of the spoons to customers in India, has been proceeding without issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1240116767/edible-cutlery-the-future-of-eco-friendly-utensils/posts/1787901 | date=19 January 2017 | website=Kickstarter | title=Kickstarter Campaign Update}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Kickstarter backers are currently attempting legal action against Bakeys due to no response after pledging over $250,000 in US dollars.

'''''Barnaviridae''''' is a family of [[viruses]]. Cultivated [[mushroom]] serve as natural hosts. There are currently only one genus (''Barnavirus'') and one species in this family: the type species ''Mushroom bacilliform virus''. Diseases associated with this family include: [[Mycovirus#History|La France disease]].&lt;ref name=ViralZone&gt;{{cite web|title=Viral Zone|url=http://viralzone.expasy.org/all_by_species/177.html|publisher=ExPASy|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ICTV&gt;{{cite web|last1=ICTV|title=Virus Taxonomy: 2014 Release|url=http://ictvonline.org/virusTaxonomy.asp|accessdate=12 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life cycle==
Viral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by penetration into the host cell. Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive stranded rna virus transcription is the method of transcription. Cultivated mushroom serve as the natural host.&lt;ref name=ViralZone /&gt;

A '''biogeographic realm''' or '''ecozone''' is the broadest [[biogeography|biogeographic]] division of the Earth's land surface, based on distributional patterns of [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]] organisms. They are subdivided in [[ecoregion]]s, which are classified in [[biome]]s or habitat types.

The realms delineate large areas of the Earth's surface within which organisms have been evolving in relative isolation over long periods of time, separated from one another by geographic features, such as [[ocean]]s, broad [[desert]]s, or high [[mountain range]]s, that constitute barriers to migration.  As such, biogeographic realms designations are used to indicate general groupings of organisms based on their shared biogeography.  Biogeographic realms correspond to the [[floristic kingdom]]s of [[botany]] or [[zoogeographic region]]s of [[zoology]].

Biogeographic realms are characterized by the evolutionary history of the organisms they contain. They are distinct from [[biome]]s, also known as major habitat types, which are divisions of the Earth's surface based on ''life form'', or the adaptation of animals, fungi, micro-organisms and plants to climatic, [[soil]], and other conditions. Biomes are characterized by similar [[climax vegetation]]. Each realm may include a number of different biomes. A [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] in Central America, for example, may be similar to one in New Guinea in its vegetation type and structure, climate, soils, etc., but these forests are inhabited by animals, fungi, micro-organisms and plants with very different evolutionary histories.

The patterns of distribution of living organisms in the world's biogeographic realms were shaped by the process of [[plate tectonics]], which has redistributed the world's land masses over geological history.

==Concept history==
The "biogeographic realms" of Udvardy (1975) were defined based on taxonomic composition. The rank corresponds more or less to the [[floristic kingdom]]s  and [[zoogeographic region]]s.&lt;ref name="Udvardy"&gt;Udvardy, M. D. F. (1975). ''A classification of the biogeographical provinces of the world.'' IUCN Occasional Paper no. 18. Morges, Switzerland: IUCN, [https://portals.iucn.org/library/efiles/documents/OP-018.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of the term "ecozone" is more variable. It was used originally in [[stratigraphy]] (Vella, 1962, Hedberg, 1971). In Canadian literature, the term was used by Wiken (1986) in macro level [[land classification]], with geographic criteria (see [[Ecozones of Canada]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wicken, E. B. 1986. ''Terrestrial ecozones of Canada'' / ''Écozones terrestres du Canada''. Environment Canada. Ecological Land Classification Series No. 19. Lands Directorate, Ottawa. 26 pp., [http://ecozones.ca/francais/introduction.html].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scott, G. 1995. Canada's vegetation: a world perspective, p., [https://books.google.com/books?id=QpHCHdrgSVoC&amp;pg=PA13].&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Schültz (1988) would use it with ecological and physiognomical criteria, in a way similar to the concept of [[biome]].&lt;ref name="Schultz"&gt;Schültz, J. ''Die Ökozonen der Erde'', 1st ed., Ulmer, Stuttgart, Germany, 1988, 488 pp.; 2nd ed., 1995, 535 pp.; 3rd ed., 2002. Transl.: ''The Ecozones of the World: The Ecological Divisions of the Geosphere''. Berlin: Springer-Verlag, 1995; 2nd ed., 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V9L8yPzAjxIC].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Global 200]]/WWF scheme (Olson &amp; Dinerstein, 1998), originally the term "biogeographic realm" in Udvardy sense was used.&lt;ref name="Olson"&gt;Olson, D. M. &amp; E. Dinerstein (1998). The Global 200: A representation approach to conserving the Earth’s most biologically valuable ecoregions. ''Conservation Biol.'' 12:502–515, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1523-1739.1998.012003502.x/abstract].&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a scheme of [[BBC]], it was replaced by the term "ecozone".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/ecozones BBC Nature - Ecozones].&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8681">A '''branch attachment''' is where a [[branch]] is attached to the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] of a [[tree]]. Three types of branch attachment are recognized due to differences in the anatomical position of buds that form them.  Two key components contribute to the mechanical [[strength of materials|strength]] and [[toughness]] of the attachment: interlocking wood grain at the top of the attachment and an embedded [[Knot (wood)|knot]] that often lies within the attachment.  A common malformation of a branch attachment is the inclusion of bark within the join, which can weaken the attachment.

==Anatomy of branch attachment in trees==
[[File:Branch attachment in Fraxinus excelsior L.jpg|thumb|Branch attachment in common ash [[Fraxinus excelsior|''Fraxinus excelsior'' L.]]]]

[[File:Branch attachment model (Slater et al., 2014).png|thumb|Figure 1: Anatomical drawing of the wood grain of a branch attachment in a tree]]
Initially [[branch]]es are mechanically attached to the [[trunk (botany)|trunks]] of trees by forming interlocking wood grain patterns at the top of the joint (Fig. 1).&lt;ref name=Slater&amp;Ennos1&gt;Slater, D. and Ennos, A. R. (2015) Interlocking wood grain patterns provide improved wood strength in forks of hazel (''Corylus avellana'' L.), ''Arboricultural Journal'' 37 (1) 1-12&lt;/ref&gt;  The xylem tissues in this location are denser than in surrounding tissues of the tree's stem or [[branch]], the wood grain pattern formed is tortuous and in these tissues there is typically a reduction in vessel length, diameter and frequency of occurrence (i.e. more of the xylem consists of fibre cells).&lt;ref&gt;Slater, D. Bradley, R, Withers, P. and Ennos, A. R. (2014) The anatomy and grain pattern in forks of hazel (Corylus avellana L.) and other tree species, ''Trees'' 28 (5) 1437-1448&lt;/ref&gt;  This specialized xylem tissue, formed under the branch bark ridge, provides unique mechanical properties to the union of the branch to the trunk, requiring that wood fibres are stretched along their length (the axial strength of the wood) in order to rupture the attachment apart.&lt;ref name=Slater&amp;Ennos1/&gt;

As the typical lateral branch of a [[tree]] and its [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] expand in diameter at different rates, the base of the smaller branch becomes occluded in the larger trunk of the [[tree]] which is producing a larger increment of growth, and this occluded part of the [[branch]] forms a [[Knot (wood)|knot]] that provides substantial additional mechanical support to the attachment as it develops (Fig. 2).  This is not the case in [[tree forks]], where the growth rate of both branches is approximately equal, and no occluded knot is formed.

The combination of the interlocking wood grain at the apex of the branch and the occluded knot embedded into the tree's trunk make mature branch attachments in trees very strong components of a tree's crown.  From static testing, branch attachments have been found to be far stronger than attachments made at [[tree forks|forks in trees]].&lt;ref&gt;Kane B., Farrell R., Zedaker S. M., Loferski J. R. and Smith D. W. (2008) Failure mode and prediction of the strength of branch attachments; ''Arboriculture &amp; Urban Forestry'' 34, 308-316&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Branch attachment model - internal view (Slater et al., 2014).png|thumb|Figure 2: Anatomical drawing of the attachment of a branch to the [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] of a tree, illustrating the formation of a [[Knot (wood)|knot]] inside the tree's [[trunk (botany)|trunk]]]]

==Types of branch attachment==

Botanists commonly differentiate between branches that originate from the initial extension growth and those that have developed epicormically from the growth of latent [[bud]]s or [[adventitiousness|adventitious]] [[bud]]s that developed later on the tree's trunk surface.&lt;ref&gt;Harris R. W., Clark J. R. &amp; Matheny N. P. (1999) ''Arboriculture: Integrated Management of Landscape Trees, Shrubs and Vines''; 3rd Edition; Prentice Hall: New Jersey&lt;/ref&gt;  A clear anatomical difference can be found on dissection between these branch attachments, in that the former has an initial [[Knot (wood)|knot]] that originates near to the stem's [[pith]], those developing from latent buds will have a bud trace that originates near the stem's [[pith]], and adventitious epicormic branches will exhibit neither of these internal features.

==Malformations of branch attachments==

A common malformation of a branch attachment in a tree is the inclusion of [[bark (botany)|bark]] within the join, commonly referred to as a 'bark inclusion' or 'included bark'.  This malformation is known to weaken the connection of the [[branch]] to the rest of the tree's structure, as it acts to block the formation of the interlocking wood grain pattern at the branch attachment's apex&lt;ref&gt;Lonsdale, D. (1999) ''Principles of Tree Hazard Assessment and Management'', TSO: London&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smiley, E. T. (2003) Does included bark reduce the strength of co-dominant stems? ''Journal of Arboriculture'' 29 (2): 104-106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Slater, D. and Ennos, A. R. (2015) The level of occlusion of included bark affects the strength of bifurcations in hazel (''Corylus avellana'' L.) ''Journal of Arboriculture and Urban Forestry'' 41 (4): 194-207&lt;/ref&gt;

Bark included branch junctions are commonly found in a wide range of tree species, and are considered to occur due to genetic traits in individual trees (e.g. fastigiated), tightly-angled joins and branches competing for light ([[phototropism]]).  In amenity trees, it is common practice for arborists to prune out young branches with such malformed attachments, subordinate the branch by reducing its length or brace the weakened branch to the rest of the tree, ideally using a flexible brace.&lt;ref&gt;Gilman E. F. (2012) ''Illustrated guide to pruning''; third edition; Delmar publishers, Albany, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previous anatomical models of branch attachment==

[[File:Representation of Alex Shigo's model of branch attachment in trees.png |thumb| Figure 3: A visual representation of the branch attachment model of Dr. Alex L. Shigo based on overlapping growth, published in 1985&lt;ref name=Shigo1&gt;
Shigo A. L. (1985) How tree branches are attached to trunks; ''Canadian Journal of Botany'' 63 (8) 1391-1401 [http://arbtalk.co.uk/forum/attachments/general-chat/174055d1421271234-how-tree-branches-attached-trunks-shigo-branches-1985.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1985, the researcher Dr. [[Alex Shigo]] published an anatomical model of branch attachment&lt;ref name=Shigo1/&gt; based on analysis of extensive tree cross-sections and which came to be widely utilised in the arboricultural industry.  Unfortunately, this model of branch attachment is illogical and anatomically incorrect.&lt;ref name=SlaterHarb01&gt;Slater, D. and Harbinson, C. J. (2010) Towards a new model for branch attachment; ''Arboricultural Journal'' 33 (2) 95-105&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of Shigo's model was that the branch base grew first, then the branch's base was overlapped by the growth of the trunk, and the further development of overlapping layers of these two distinct xylem tissues resulted in the development of a strong connection (Fig. 3).  However, this model does not take into account the anatomy of [[tree forks]], nor when tree growth is continuous (such as in tropical trees) and it requires contortions of the [[vascular cambium]] that are infeasible.&lt;ref name=SlaterHarb01/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nrs.fs.fed.us/pubs/jrnl/2012/nrs_2012_smith-k_001.pdf Response to Slater and Harinson&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the development of Shigo's model of branch attachment, it was commonly thought that wood grain traversed directly from the top of the branch into the trunk of the tree, ascending to the tree's crown.  Such a wood grain arrangement would result in sap travelling from the foliage at the end of the branch to other foliage in the tree's crown, which is contrary to the 'source-to-sink' model widely accepted for sap distribution in all woody plants,&lt;ref&gt;Kramer P. J. &amp; Kozlowski T. T. (1979)  ''Physiology of Woody Plants''; New York: Academic Press, Inc&lt;/ref&gt; and can clearly be seen not to be the case by dissections of junctions formed in trees.

The gas can be [[natural gas]] (which is mainly [[methane]]) or a [[liquefied petroleum gas]], such as [[propane]], [[butane]], or a mixture of both.

== History ==
In 1852 the University of Heidelberg hired Bunsen and promised him a new laboratory building.  The city of Heidelberg had begun to install [[coal-gas]] street lighting, and so the university laid gas lines to the new laboratory.

The designers of the building intended to use the gas not just for illumination, but also in burners for laboratory operations.  For any burner lamp, it was desirable to maximize the temperature and minimize luminosity.  However, existing laboratory burner lamps left much to be desired not just in terms of the heat of the flame, but also regarding economy and simplicity.

While the building was still under construction in late 1854, Bunsen suggested certain design principles to the university's mechanic, [[Peter Desaga]], and asked him to construct a prototype. Similar principles had been used in an earlier burner design by [[Michael Faraday]], as well as in a device patented in 1856 by the gas engineer R. W. Elsner. The Bunsen/Desaga design succeeded in generating a hot, sootless, non-luminous flame by mixing the gas with air in a controlled fashion before combustion.  Desaga created adjustable slits for air at the bottom of the cylindrical burner, with the flame igniting at the top.  By the time the building opened early in 1855 Desaga had made 50 burners for Bunsen's students.  Two years later Bunsen published a description, and many of his colleagues soon adopted the design.  Bunsen burners are now used in laboratories all around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Ihde, Aaron John | title = The development of modern chemistry| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=34KwmkU4LG0C&amp;pg=PA233| date = 1984| publisher = Courier Dover Publications| isbn = 978-0-486-64235-2| pages = 233–236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
[[File:Bunsen_burner_flame_types.jpg|thumb|left|Bunsen burner flames depend on air flow in the throat holes (on the burner side, not the needle valve for gas flow): 1. air hole closed (safety flame used for lighting or default), 2. air hole slightly open, 3. air hole half-open, 4. air hole fully open (roaring blue flame).]]
The device in use today safely burns a continuous stream of a flammable [[gas]] such as [[natural gas]] (which is principally [[methane]]) or a [[liquefied petroleum gas]] such as [[propane]], [[butane]], or a mixture of both.

The hose barb is connected to a gas nozzle on the laboratory bench with rubber tubing.  Most laboratory benches are equipped with multiple gas nozzles connected to a central gas source, as well as vacuum, [[nitrogen]], and steam nozzles.  The gas then flows up through the base through a small hole at the bottom of the barrel and is directed upward. There are open slots in the side of the tube bottom to admit air into the stream using the [[Venturi effect]], and the gas burns at the top of the tube once ignited by a flame or spark.  The most common methods of lighting the burner are using a [[match]] or a [[spark lighter]].

The amount of air mixed with the gas stream affects the completeness of the [[combustion]] reaction.  Less air yields an incomplete and thus cooler reaction, while a gas stream well mixed with air provides oxygen in a [[stoichiometric]] amount and thus a complete and hotter reaction.  The air flow can be controlled by opening or closing the slot openings at the base of the barrel, similar in function to the [[Choke valve|choke]] in a [[carburettor]].

[[File:Laboratory tripod with other lab equipments.jpg|thumb|A Bunsen burner situated below a [[Tripod (laboratory)|tripod]]]]
If the collar at the bottom of the tube is adjusted so more air can mix with the gas before combustion, the flame will burn hotter, appearing blue as a result.  If the holes are closed, the gas will only mix with ambient air at the point of combustion, that is, only after it has exited the tube at the top.  This reduced mixing produces an incomplete reaction, producing a cooler but brighter yellow, which is often called the "safety flame" or "[[luminous flame]]".  The yellow flame is [[luminosity|luminous]] due to small [[soot]] particles in the flame, which are heated to [[incandescence]]. The yellow flame is considered "dirty" because it leaves a layer of carbon on whatever it is heating.  When the burner is regulated to produce a hot, blue flame, it can be nearly invisible against some backgrounds. The hottest part of the flame is the tip of the inner flame, while the coolest is the whole inner flame. Increasing the amount of fuel gas flow through the tube by opening the [[needle valve]] will increase the size of the flame.  However, unless the airflow is adjusted as well, the flame temperature will decrease because an increased amount of gas is now mixed with the same amount of air, starving the flame of oxygen.

Generally, the burner is placed underneath a [[Tripod (laboratory)|laboratory tripod]], which supports a [[Beaker (glassware)|beaker]] or other container. The burner will often be placed on a suitable [[heatproof mat]] to protect the laboratory bench surface.

A Bunsen burner is also used in [[microbiology]] laboratories to sterilise pieces of equipment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/sites/default/files/safety/sop/SOP_Spreading_Bacterial_Cultures.pdf |title=Spreading Liquid Cultures of Bacteria on Agar-Media Plates |publisher=chemistry.ucla.edu |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to produce an updraft that forces airborne contaminants away from the working area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3941987/ |doi= 10.3791/2754 |title= Aseptic Laboratory Techniques: Volume Transfers with Serological Pipettes and Micropipettors |first=Erin R. |last=Sanders |journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
Other burners based on the same principle exist. The most important alternatives to the Bunsen burner are:
* [[Teclu burner]] – The lower part of its tube is conical, with a round screw nut below its base. The gap, set by the distance between the nut and the end of the tube, regulates the influx of the air in a way similar to the open slots of the Bunsen burner. The Teclu burner provides better mixing of air and fuel and can achieve higher flame temperatures than the Bunsen burner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title =  Ein neuer Laboratoriums-Brenner|first = Nicolae|last = Teclu|authorlink = Nicolae Teclu|journal = [[J.

* [[Meker-Fisher burner|Meker burner]] – The lower part of its tube has more openings with larger total cross-section, admitting more air and facilitating better mixing of air and gas. The tube is wider and its top is covered with a wire grid. The grid separates the flame into an array of smaller flames with a common external envelope, and also prevents [[Oxy-fuel welding and cutting#Flashback|flashback]] to the bottom of the tube, which is a risk at high air-to-fuel ratios and limits the maximum rate of air intake in a conventional Bunsen burner. Flame temperatures of up to {{convert|1100|-|1200|°C|°F|-2}} are achievable if properly used. The flame also burns without noise, unlike the Bunsen or Teclu burners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zco6AAAAIAAJ|page=38|title=Domestic Science, Volume 2|first= Charles W. |last=Hale| publisher=Cambridge University Press|location= London|year= 1915}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tirrill burner]] – The base of the burner has a needle valve which allows the regulation of gas intake directly from the Burner, rather than from the gas source.  Maximum temperature of flame can reach 1560&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Flinn scientific.  http://www.flinnsci.com/store/Scripts/prodView.asp?idproduct=14010&lt;/ref&gt;

The cephalium will only begin growing after a cactus has reached a certain size or age. Once flowering begins the flower buds will form from the cephalium.

{{Hispanic and Latino Americans}}
'''Chonga''' is a Spanish-derived term used especially in [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]], often to indicate a working-class, sexualized, aggressive, and emotionally expressive young woman.

Chongas are also a distinct [[subculture]], believed to have developed in [[Miami]] in the late 20th century. Members are typically young, working-class Latina women. In South Florida the term is usually considered a pejorative, though some young women are proud to identify themselves as such. While feminist scholarship on chongas is limited, early work by [[gender studies]] scholar Jillian Hernandez has suggested that the chonga identity is an "emerging [[icon]]", and that it can be empowering for working-class women.

==Etymology and meaning==
The intended meaning of the term "chonga" varies depending on the context in which it is used. The most specific meaning of the term denotes a member of the chonga subculture—young, usually working class and Latina women—who dress and often act in a sexualized, brash, sometimes aggressive manner. The term also has three looser meanings: as a synonym for prostitute; to refer to a woman who acts "gangsta" or in a thug like manner; and among female friends, as a jovial way to greet each other, as an alternative to "girlfriend!"&lt;ref name="hern68"&gt;Hernandez 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"&gt;Lush 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the term to refer to young women is believed to have arisen in [[Miami]], and only became prominent in the early 21st century. The same word has long been used in Latin American countries such as [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]] to refer to a brothel; the modern US usage of the word may be related to this, or might have arisen independently among Floridian Cuban-Americans. 

"Chonga" has lexical similarities with several other Spanish terms, some of which have been in use for centuries.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt; These include: 
* ''[[Cholo|chola]]''  - used in the [[Southwestern United States]] for women of [[Mexican people|Mexican]] or [[Mexican American|Mexican-American]] descent, sometimes with the added meaning that they are a "homegirl" or someone from the streets.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;
* ''chula'' - which denotes a cute or sexy young woman.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;
* ''chusma'' - in the US, this term is often used to denote  an oversexualized and under-Americanized woman of [[Cuban people|Cuban]] descent. In Latin America, the term can merely refer to loud, working-class women, and can even refer to a rabble, some of whom might not be female.&lt;ref name="hern68"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Muñoz 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chonga subculture==
According to the journalist Tamara Lush, Chonga subculture may have first appeared in [[Miami]] during the 1980s. Early chongas were usually Cuban teenagers whose parents had recently immigrated to the US. In the 1990s, chongas often wore white shorts with a colored thong underneath, basketball jerseys, and fake gold jewelry. Over the years the style evolved, with for instance tight jeans becoming more popular than shorts.&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt;

===Chonga characteristics===
21st-century chongas will often exhibit at least some of the following characteristics: 
*Cheap but sexy clothing, which often includes "Brazilian jeans"&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Pocketless [[Skinny jeans]] that usually have an accentuating effect on the bottom.&lt;/ref&gt; and revealing tops, a preference for gelled hair, synthetic nails and gaudy jewelry, often including fake gold, bangles and earring hoops.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Chongas sometimes like to have their names written on the hoops.&lt;/ref&gt;   
*Sexual availability, often along with a preference to be surrounded by men.  
*Hostility to other young women, unless they are fellow members of the same chonga crew.  
*Loud, emotionally expressive and aggressive behavior.&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez ''passim'', and esp. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all chongas live up to these stereotypes; for example, sometimes women whose conduct is the most overtly sexualized will in fact be among the least interested in actual heterosexual encounters—in some cases chonga behavior is perhaps best understood as a kind of bonding between female friends.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depictions in the media===
Until 2007, chongas have rarely appeared in the media, despite their high visibility in real life. One of the rare exceptions was the ''Cheerleaders'' (2000) set of art photographs by [[Luis Gispert]].&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 77-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luisgispert.com/index.php#mi=2&amp;pt=1&amp;pi=10000&amp;s=16&amp;p=1&amp;a=0&amp;at=0 The cheerleader set of images on Gispert's web site]. Not all pics feature chonga-like lasses; for an iconic image discussed at length in Hernandez, see pic no. 15. See also pic nos. 3, 9, 16 &amp; 17.&lt;/ref&gt; In popular culture, the few exceptions include [[Bratz]] dolls which have a chonga-like appearance; the chonga-like characters Lydia and Melina in the television comedy [[MADtv]]; and the chonga-like character Tina in the movie ''[[Do the Right Thing]]''.&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Chongas became considerably more common in popular culture after the 2007 release of [[Chongalicious]], a YouTube [[viral video]]. Hernandez noted that the only depiction she's aware of that accurately showed chongas in their social context was the 2007 "Bratz girls" exhibition by the ''GisMo Collective'' (Jessica Gispert and Crystal Molinary).&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 68, 79-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In cultural and gender studies===
According to a 2009 article by gender studies scholar Jillian Hernandez, feminist literature covering chongas remains sparse, even after their profile was raised by the ''Chongalicious'' video. Hernandez contrasts this with the extensive body of work on [[Chicana feminism]], which explores the ''chola'' and ''chusma'' phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 86-87.&lt;/ref&gt; Hernandez argues the chonga image has become iconic in Miami, and states that the aesthetic appeal of the chonga can be considerable, which in her opinion partly explains why the ''cheerleaders'' set of photographs was successful in launching Gispert's international career.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The portrayal of chongas in the media can, however, be problematic, sometimes even repressive, as powerful negative images contribute to Latinas internalizing pressure to conform which originates from the dominant Anglo-American culture.&lt;ref&gt;Guzmán  2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Stereotypical representations of chongas can play a role in the United States' wider [[culture wars#United States of America|culture wars]], adding to concerns about the sexuality of some Latina women being "out of control" with their perceived high rate of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Gutiérrez ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Citing earlier work by Isabel Molina Guzmán,&lt;ref&gt;''Disorderly Bodies and Discourses of Latinidad in the Elián González Story'', Isabel Molina Guzmán (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Hernandez relates this to the [[Elián González affair]], where the media portrayal of Marisleysis González as having the chonga-like characteristic of emotional excess contributed to the degradation of the  privileged, "model minority status" that [[Cuban Americans]] had previously enjoyed.&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her own research, Hernandez found that most people she questioned considered "chonga" a pejorative term. One respondent even went as far as to say the term sums up all the negative Latina stereotypes. A few asserted that while they know several chongas, they don't know any who self-identify as such. Sometimes Latina women will admit they went through a brief "chonga" phase in their early teens, but later came to view the style as uncool. Yet some chongas chose to retain the identity into their twenties. Hernandez also found that some young woman are proud to call themselves chongas. Several expressed pride in their sexual attractiveness. The creators of "Chongalicious", who are themselves middle class, found they had considerably more male attention while pretending to be chongas, one of them saying back in 2007 that "I think we would have boyfriends if we were real chongas."&lt;ref name = "Chongas!"/&gt; Hernandez suggests that the chonga sub culture is in several ways a positive thing, representing women who are not shamed into invisibility by their low-class status or ethnic identity. She anticipates a broadening and deepening of feminist scholarship on chongas, to uncover the ways in which the chonga identity can be helpful to young women exploring their "bodies and pleasures".&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Hernandez notes that she is consciously echoing [[Michel Foucault]] in using the term "bodies and pleasures", as she sees it as a more empowering alternative to "sexuality".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez ''passim'', esp. 86-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[telecommunication]], a '''combined distribution frame''' (CDF) is a [[distribution frame]] that combines the functions of [[Main distribution frame|main]] and [[intermediate distribution frame]]s and contains both vertical and horizontal terminating blocks.  

The vertical blocks are used to terminate the permanent outside lines entering the station. Horizontal blocks are used to terminate [[inside plant]] equipment. This arrangement permits the association of any outside [[telephone line|line]] with any desired [[terminal equipment]]. These connections are made either with twisted pair wire, normally referred to as jumper wire, or with [[optical fiber]] cables, normally referred to as jumper cables. 

In technical control facilities, the vertical side may be used to terminate equipment as well as outside lines. The horizontal side is then used for [[Patch panel|jackfields]] and battery terminations.

The '''conservation and restoration of panel paintings''' involves working with an object that is composed of two media: wood and paint.  The process of [[conservation and restoration of paintings]] on canvas is different to that of [[panel paintings]]. In the U.S., it is recommended that conservation practices  follow the "Code of Ethics"  set by the [[American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice|url=http://www.conservation-us.org/our-organizations/association-(aic)/governance/code-of-ethics-and-guidelines-for-practice#.WNlADKK1vtQ|website=www.conservation-us.org|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Preventative care ==
Preventative care is a form of conserving panel paintings. Improper storage conditions, environmental conditions, and handling can act as catalysts in damaging effects. These include chemical and structural damage, seen through skin oils and degradation that can be caused by high humidity or high temperature levels.  The conservation of panel paintings can be achieved by a series of methods, including: 

=== Handling ===
The recommended handling method of panel paintings is similar to that of canvas paintings and other two-dimensional works. The procedure includes planning the move, handling with two hands or in tandem, communication within the handling staff during the move, the use of nitrile gloves, the use of painting carts and other tools including a pallet jack or furniture dolly when moving a panel painting within a crat.

=== Storage ===
Typical storage units in museums include sliding screens or slotted shelves made out of MDF and heat treated wood coated in polyurethane.  "S" Hooks are used to hang objects with the proper hanging hardware (e.g. D-Rings or eye brackets with picture wire) onto the screen. Temporary storage solutions include the use of ethafoam, moving/packing blankets, and [http://www.gaylord.com/Preservation/Conservation-Supplies/Boards-%26-Paper/Gaylord-Archival%26%23174%3B-48-x-96%22-E-flute-Corrugated-Board-%2815-Pack%29/p/EFCB4892 archival corrugated cardboard].

=== Environmental conditions ===
Fluctuating humidity and temperatures can lead to smaller problems within the structure and painted surface that in the long-term accumulate. In panels that are made up of multiple pieces of wood composing the larger surface area, the damage can be visible where the pieces of wood are attached&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Structural Conservationof Panel Paintings|last=J.

In exhibitions panel paintings are subjected to various environmental conditions. The exhibition conditions must also be regulated to conserve the painting. These factor includes temperature, humidity , light intensity and duration of exposure, and air and atmospheric pollutants. There must be sufficient air filters attached to the HVAC system to reduce the air pollutants within the air in gallery/exhibition spaces along with storage areas (via reducing gases potentially emitted by various objects). Light levels must be at approximately 50-200 Lux as there is an irreversible light lifetime per panel painting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/conservation-preservation-publications/canadian-conservation-institute-notes/environmental-display-guidelines-paintings.html|title=Environmental Guidelines for Paintings - Canadian Conservation Institute (CCI) Notes 10/4|last=Canadian Conservation Institute|first=|date=|website=Government of Canadq|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Integrated pest management ===
[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 1140 Damage Done by a Furniture Beetle.jpg|thumb|400x400px|CSIRO ScienceImage 1140 Damage Done by a Furniture Beetle]]
[[Museum integrated pest management|Integrated Pest Management]] policies are created to reduce or limit any problems relating to pests damaging objects within collections. Concepts discussed in Integrated Pest Management Policies include restricting food and sugary drink consumption in exhibition, storage areas and surrounding areas along with maintaining cleanliness in exhibition and storage areas. 
== Examples of causes of damage ==

==Examination ==

===Structural===

[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 1831 Borer damaged wood.jpg|alt=CSIRO ScienceImage 1831 Borer damaged wood|thumb|CSIRO ScienceImage 1831 Borer damaged wood]]
Proper examination of the object is an initial step in the conservation process. Commonly used technologies include radiography and reflectography. Radiography provides the effective technique in terms of analyzing the condition and preservation work done on the structure of panel paintings. Other uses of radiography can be seen by the opaqueness of specific colors used in the painting, condition of the wood, thickness or density of the wood, and various damage done by pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic35-02-005.html|title=Air-Coupled Ultrasonic System: A New Technology For Detecting Flaws In Paintings On Wooden Panels|last=Murray|first=Alison|date=1996|website=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/panelpaintings4.pdf|title=Current Approaches to the Structural Conservation of Panel Paintings|last=|first=|date=October 29, 1998|website=The Getty Conservation Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other examples can be found through Museumpests.net's [http://museumpests.net/identification/ Identification] page.

=== Surface and painting ===

Photographic documentation and the use of magnification with the naked eye used with diffuse and [[raking light]] are common methods used at art museums like the [http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/ophelia/conservation-ophelia/raking-light-and-relief Tate Museum] in the United Kingdom, these are effective tools for initial observation. Causes for damage in the surface of panel paintings can be caused by the structural issues in the wood, these include damage done by wood-boring pests. Damage to the painting can also be caused by the fluctuation of temperatures and relative humidity levels.

==Treatments==

===Structural===

Pests can cause damage to the wood panels used in panel paintings. The pests must be eradicated prior to conservation to ensure the longevity of the object and the conservation work. Examples of treatments include:
* '''Isolation through bagging''' - putting the object in isolation with blotter paper, paper board, tissue or foam sealed in a polyethylene bag and monitored over several weeks or months.
* '''Low Temperature''' - typically putting the object into a freeze (qualified for this type of use). The freezer must reach -20°F (-29°C) and objects must be put into the freezer inside a resealable plastic bag to be froze during 4 hours.
[[File:Cradled panel painting, Aert van der Neer.jpg|thumb|Cradled panel painting, Aert van der Neer]]
Conservators must adapt to the specific case of each panel and must use their experience to their advantage. Structures used in conservation include: 
* '''Custom strainers''' that are curved to match the panel with springs to safely flex.
* [[Cradling (paintings)|'''Cradling''']] - Cradling refers to the addition of support on the rear part of the panels. These must have flexibility to allow for some movement from slight temperature and humidity changes.
* '''Adhesives''' - If there is a simple crack within the panel, adhesives are used in combination of alignment, and moderate compression. All adhesives used must adhere to the "Code of Ethics" and must be reversible.

Treatment of adhesives include:
* Reactivation of hide glues. 
* Adding water-based emulsion glues to existing and failing adhesives.
* Replacing failed adhesives with new ones. 
Examples of adhesives include:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/panelpaintings1.pdf|title=A Survey of Adhesives for Wood Conservation|last=Williams|first=Donald C.|date=April 1995|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Natural protein adhesives''' - found through animal products such as casein, albumin, fish glue, and animal-hide glue.
* '''Natural resins''' - often seen in historic objects. 
* '''Synthetic resin adhesives''' - "aqueous emulsions of  polyvinyl acetate (PVA) and arecommonly called “white” glues"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Transfer of panel paintings|Transfer of Panel Paintings]] - The transferral of a painting from an often unstable panel to another panel is considered to be a delicate process. This process occurs when there has been a form of degradation in the original panel (possible causes include pest damage (burrowing), warping, or the thinning of the panel). The transfer should be made to a similarly aged panel, made out of the same wood type. The National Gallery in the United Kingdom provides an example with [http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/research/conservation-history Raphael's ''Virgin and Child'']

When a panel is submerged due to flooding, the recommended procedure is to expose the panel painting through a long drying process prior to any further conservation work.

The conservation of paintings varies for the different types of oil, acrylic and fresco paintings. These techniques include cleaning, removal and replacement of degraded varnish and the restoration of paint losses. The Tate Museum described that "Cleaning is a particularly delicate and demanding part of conserving and restoring paintings. Layers of dirt, discoloured varnish and old restorations that may be disfiguring or obscuring parts of the composition are painstakingly removed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/about/our-work/conservation/paintings|title=Conservation – paintings|last=|first=|date=|website=The Tate Museum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution of modern paints, that can be used in panel paintings, has contributed to facilitate conservation. "The introduction of synthetic binders—most notably acrylic, alkyd, polyvinyl acetate, and nitrocellulose—has resulted in paints that exhibit fast drying times, reduced yellowing tendencies, a vast range of appearances and handling properties and, in the case of emulsion formulations, great flexibility and the elimination of organic solvents as thinners and diluents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/modpaints/|title=Modern Paints|last=|first=|date=|website=The Getty Conservation Institute|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outreach ==
The Penn Museum, based out of Philadelphia (Pennsylvania), created the ''[https://www.penn.museum/sites/artifactlab Artifact Lab],'' where visitors interact with content related to the museum.  The webpage provides a blog and other relevant pages relating to their Artifact Lab and its operations. It has a blog section discussing topics from general cleaning (with objects under different lights), to the use of various scanning technologies (such as X-radiography).

[[File:Efficiency diagram by Zureks.svg|thumb|Useful output energy is always lower than input energy.]]
[[File:Ene Flow Pow Plt uni.png|thumb|Efficiency of power plants, world total, 2008]]

'''Energy conversion efficiency''' ('''''η''''') is the [[ratio]] between the useful output of an [[energy conversion machine]] and the input, in [[energy]] terms. The input, as well as the useful output may be [[chemical]], [[electric power]], [[mechanical work]], [[light]] (radiation), or [[heat]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

== Overview ==
Energy conversion efficiency depends on the usefulness of the output. All or part of the heat produced from burning a fuel may become rejected [[waste heat]] if, for example, work is the desired output from a [[thermodynamic cycle]]. Energy converter is an example of an energy transformation. For example a light bulb falls into the categories energy converter.  
&lt;math&gt;
\eta = \frac{P_\mathrm{out}}{P_\mathrm{in}}
&lt;/math&gt;
Even though the definition includes the notion of usefulness, [[wikt:efficiency|efficiency]] is considered a [[technology|technical]] or [[physics|physical]] term. Goal or mission oriented terms include [[effectiveness]] and [[efficacy]].

Generally, energy conversion efficiency is a [[dimensionless]] number between 0 and 1.0, or 0% to 100%.  Efficiencies may not exceed 100%, e.g., for a [[perpetual motion]] machine.  However, other [[thermal efficiency|effectiveness measures]] that can exceed 1.0 are used for [[heat pumps]] and other devices that move heat rather than convert it.

When talking about the efficiency of heat engines and power stations the convention should be stated, i.e., HHV ({{aka}} Gross Heating Value, etc.) or LCV (a.k.a. Net Heating value), and  whether gross output (at the generator terminals) or net output (at the power station fence) are being considered.  The two are separate but both must be stated. Failure to do so causes endless confusion.

Related, more specific terms include
*[[Electrical efficiency]], useful power output per electrical power consumed;
*[[Mechanical efficiency]], where one form of mechanical energy (e.g. potential energy of water) is converted to mechanical energy ([[Mechanical work|work]]);
*[[Thermal efficiency]] or [[Fuel efficiency]], useful [[heat]] and/or [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] [[Work output|output]] per input energy such as the [[fuel]] consumed;
*'Total efficiency', e.g., for [[cogeneration]], useful [[electric power]] and heat output per fuel energy consumed.  Same as the [[thermal efficiency]].
*[[Luminous efficiency]], that portion of the emitted electromagnetic radiation is usable for human vision.

==Fuel heating values and efficiency==
In Europe the usable energy content of fuel is typically calculated using the '''[[lower heating value]]''' (LHV) of that fuel, the definition of which assumes that the [[water vapor]] produced during fuel [[combustion]] (oxidation), remains gaseous, and is not [[condensation|condensed]] to liquid water so the latent heat of vaporization of that water is not  usable. Using the LHV, a [[condensing boiler]] can achieve a "heating efficiency" in excess of 100% (this does not violate the [[first law of thermodynamics]] as long as the LHV convention is understood, but does cause confusion). This is because the apparatus recovers part of the [[heat of vaporization]], which is not included in the definition of the lower heating value of fuel.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} In the U.S. and elsewhere, the '''[[higher heating value]]''' (HHV) is used, which includes the latent heat for condensing the water vapor, and thus the thermodynamic maximum of 100% efficiency cannot be exceeded with HHV's use.

==Wall-plug efficiency, luminous efficiency, and efficacy==
[[File:Rare gas flashtube spectral outputs.JPG|thumb|The absolute irradiance of four different gases when used in a flashtube. Xenon is by far the most efficient of the gases, although krypton is more effective at a specific wavelength of light.]]
[[File:Eyesensitivity.svg|thumb|The sensitivity of the human eye to various wavelengths. Assuming each wavelength equals 1 watt of radiant energy, only the center wavelength is perceived as 685 [[candela]]s (1 watt of luminous energy), equaling 685 lumens. The vertical colored-lines represent the 589 (yellow) sodium line, and popular 532 nm (green), 671 nm (red), 473 nm (blue), and 405 nm (violet) laser pointers.]]
[[File:Fluorescent Energy.svg|thumb|A [[Sankey diagram]] showing the multiple stages of energy loss between the wall plug and the light output of a fluorescent lamp. The greatest losses occur due to the Stokes shift.]]

In optical systems such as lighting and [[laser]]s, the energy conversion efficiency is often referred to as [[wall-plug efficiency]]. The wall-plug efficiency is the measure of output radiative-energy, in [[watt]]s ([[joule]]s per second), per the total of the input electrical-energy in watts. The output-energy is usually measured in terms of [[Absolute scale|absolute]] [[irradiance]] and the wall-plug efficiency is given as a percentage of the total input-energy, with the inverse percentage representing the losses.

The wall-plug efficiency differs from the ''luminous efficiency'' in that wall-plug efficiency describes the direct output/input conversion of energy (the amount of [[Work (physics)|work]] that can be performed) whereas luminous efficiency takes into account the human eye's varying sensitivity to different wavelengths (how well it can illuminate a space). Instead of using watts, the power of a light source to produce wavelengths proportional to human perception is measured in [[lumen (unit)|lumen]]s. The human eye is most sensitive to wavelengths of 555 [[nanometer]]s (greenish-yellow) but the sensitivity decreases dramatically to either side of this wavelength, following a [[Gaussian profile|Gaussian]] power-curve and dropping to zero sensitivity at the red and violet ends of the spectrum. Due to this the eye does not usually see all of the wavelengths emitted by a particular light-source, nor does it see all of the wavelengths within the visual spectrum equally. Yellow and green, for example, make up more than 50% of what the eye perceives as being white, even though in terms of radiant energy white-light is made from equal portions of all colors (i.e.: a 5 mw green laser appears brighter than a 5 mw red laser, yet the red laser stands-out better against a white background). Therefore, the [[radiant intensity]] of a light source may be much greater than its [[luminous intensity]], meaning that the source emits more energy than the eye can use. Likewise, the lamp's wall-plug efficiency is usually greater than its luminous efficiency. The effectiveness of a light source to convert electrical energy into wavelengths of visible light, in proportion to the sensitivity of the human eye, is referred to as [[luminous efficacy]], which is measured in units of lumens per watt (lm/w) of electrical input-energy. 

Unlike efficacy (effectiveness), which is a [[unit of measurement]], efficiency is [[unitless]] number expressed as a [[percentage]], requiring only that the input and output units be of the same type. Therefore, the luminous efficiency of a light source is the percentage of luminous efficacy per the theoretical-maximum efficacy at a specific wavelength. The amount of energy carried by a photon of light is determined by its wavelength. In lumens, this energy is offset by the eye's sensitivity to the selected wavelengths. For example, a green [[laser pointer]] can have greater than 30 times the apparent brightness of a red pointer of the same power output. At 555 nm in wavelength, 1 watt of radiant energy is equivalent to 685 lumens, thus a monochromatic light source at this wavelength, with a luminous efficacy of 685 lm/w, has a luminous efficiency of 100%. The theoretical-maximum efficacy lowers for wavelengths at either side of 555 nm. For example, [[low-pressure sodium lamp]]s produce [[monochromatic light]] at 589 nm with a luminous efficacy of 200 lm/w, which is the highest of any lamp. The theoretical-maximum efficacy at that wavelength is 525 lm/w, so the lamp has a luminous efficiency of 38.1%. Because the lamp is monochromatic, the luminous efficiency nearly matches the wall-plug efficiency of &lt; 40%.&lt;ref&gt;''Applied Atomic Collision Physics, Volume 5'' by H. S. W. Massey, E. W. McDaniel, B. Bederson -- Academic Press 1982 Page 383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.photonics.com/a28677/Efficacy_Limits_for_Solid-State_White_Light&lt;/ref&gt; 

Calculations for luminous efficiency become more complex for lamps that produce white light or a mixture of spectral lines. [[Fluorescent lamps]] have higher wall-plug efficiencies than low-pressure sodium lamps, but only have half the luminous efficacy of ~ 100 lm/w, thus the luminous efficiency of fluorescents is lower than sodium lamps. A xenon [[flashtube]] has a typical wall-plug efficiency of 50--70%, exceeding that of most other forms of lighting. Because the flashtube emits large amounts of infrared and ultraviolet radiation, only a portion of the output energy is used by the eye. The luminous efficacy is therefore typically around 50 lm/w. However, not all applications for lighting involve the human eye nor are restricted to visible wavelengths. For [[laser pumping]], the efficacy is not related to the human eye so it is not called "luminous" efficacy, but rather simply "efficacy" as it relates to the absorption lines of the [[laser medium]]. Krypton flashtubes are often chosen for pumping [[Nd:YAG laser]]s, even though their wall-plug efficiency is typically only ~ 40%. [[Krypton]]'s spectral lines better match the absorption lines of the [[neodymium]]-[[Dopant|doped]] crystal, thus the efficacy of krypton for this purpose is much higher than [[xenon]]; able to produce up to twice the laser output for the same electrical input.&lt;ref&gt;''Advanced Optical Instruments and Techniques'' by Daniel Malacara Hernández -- CRC Press 2018 Page 589&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Solid-state laser engineering'' by Walter Koechner – Springer-Verlag 1965 Page 335&lt;/ref&gt; All of these terms refer to the amount of energy and lumens as they exit the light source, disregarding any losses that might occur within the lighting fixture or subsequent output optics. ''Luminaire efficiency'' refers to the total lumen-output from the fixture per the lamp output.&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding LED Illumination'' by M. Nisa Khan -- CRC Press 2014 Page 21--23&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of a few light sources, such as [[incandescent light bulb]]s, most light sources have multiple stages of energy conversion between the "wall plug" (electrical input point, which may include batteries, direct wiring, or other sources) and the final light-output, with each stage producing a loss. Low-pressure sodium lamps initially convert the electrical energy using an [[electrical ballast]], to maintain the proper current and voltage, but some energy is lost in the ballast. Similarly, fluorescent lamps also convert the electricity using a ballast (electronic efficiency). The electricity is then converted into light energy by the [[electrical arc]] (electrode efficiency and discharge efficiency). The light is then transferred to a fluorescent coating that only absorbs suitable wavelengths, with some losses of those wavelengths due to reflection off and transmission through the coating (transfer efficiency). The number of photons absorbed by the coating will not match the number then reemitted as [[fluorescence]] ([[Quantum yield|quantum efficiency]]). Finally, due to the phenomenon of the [[Stokes shift]], the reemitted photons will have a shorter wavelength (thus lower energy) than the absorbed photons (fluorescence efficiency). In very similar fashion, lasers also experience many stages of conversion between the wall plug and the output [[aperture]]. The terms "wall-plug efficiency" or "energy conversion efficiency" are therefore used to denote the overall efficiency of the energy-conversion device, deducting the losses from each stage, although this may exclude external components needed to operate some devices, such as coolant pumps.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rp-photonics.com/wall_plug_efficiency.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of Luminescent Semiconductor Materials'' by Leah Bergman, Jeanne L. McHale -- CRC Press 2012 Page 270&lt;/ref&gt;

The environmental revolution follows other technological revolutions such as the [[Industrial Revolution]] and the [[Digital Revolution]].
[[Image:Enten und Gänse als Gartenhelfer.jpg|thumb|right|400px|An example of '''permaculture''', a [[sustainable]] form of [[farming]], using animals and gardens.]]

==History==

The environmental movement has its roots in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="mtmultipleuse1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtmultipleuse.org/endangered/esahistory.htm |title=History of Environmentalism |publisher=Mtmultipleuse.org |date= |accessdate=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Underwood Johnson]] and [[John Muir]] founded the [[Sierra Club]] in 1892 after successfully lobbying Congress to create [[Yosemite National Park]].

The modern environmental movement began in the mid-to-late 1960s.&lt;ref name="mtmultipleuse1"/&gt; Environmental problems had been illustrated in books such as [[Silent Spring]] and there was a [[back-to-the-land movement]], closely associated with the [[Hippie movement]] and [[Counterculture]].

By the 1990s, the need for [[green technology]] was realized, and the development of [[electric cars]] and [[alternative energy]] gradually began to become mainstream. In the first decades of the 21st century, significant progress has been made. The first new electric cars were released to the public in 2010, and environmentalism has gone from being fringe to being completely mainstream, even embraced by [[Conservatism|conservative]] institutions such as the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

==New technologies==

Many environmentally friendly technologies, such as electric cars, [[solar power]], [[geothermal energy]], [[wind power]], [[vertical farming]], [[recycling]], [[permaculture]], [[hydroponics]], [[Efficient energy use|energy-efficient]] technology such as [[fluorescent lighting]] and [[LEDs]] and [[high-speed rail]] have been implemented or have become mainstream in Western nations since 1980. Developing nations have also embraced these technologies, and China has become the world's leading manufacturer of wind turbines and solar-electric panels in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/business/energy-environment/31renew.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=China Leading Global Race to Make Clean Energy « |publisher=nytimes.org |date=2010-01-30 |accessdate=2013-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Estate maps''' were maps commissioned by [[landed gentry|individual landowners]] or institutions, to show their [[Estate (land)|extensive landed property]], typically including fields, [[Designed landscape|parkland]] and buildings. They were used for display and estate management and were fashionable from the 16th to the 19th century. 

==History==
In [[England and Wales]], estate maps began to be produced in large numbers during the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=P. D. A. |last=Harvey |title=Maps in Tudor England |publisher=Public Record Office/British Library |place=London |year=1993 |isbn=0-7123-0311-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The availability of new estates as a result of the [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] gave increased impetus to their production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art of the Mapmaker in Essex|publisher=Essex County Council|year=1947|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estate maps continued in popularity until the middle of the 19th century, when large scale [[tithe maps|tithe]] and [[Ordnance Survey]] maps became available. The [[English country house#Decline|decline of many country estates]] led to the dismantling of many of the traditional landed estates in the early to mid 20th century.

A few maps were drawn prior to the 16th century, but these were ad hoc, for a particular purpose. Before the emergence of the estate map, [[manor]]s and other estates were usually managed using written documents listing the buildings, fields and tenants. These were known variously as surveys, rentals and extents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=P. D. A. |last=Harvey |title=Manorial Records |publisher=[[British Records Association]] |series=Archives and the User |volume=5 |year=1984 |place=London |ISBN=0-900222-06-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the adoption of estate maps, the use of mapless surveys continued, although it gradually declined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=A. Sarah |last=Bendall |title=Maps, Land and Society: A History, with a Carto-bibliography, of Cambridgeshire Estate Maps, 1600–1836 |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1992 |isbn=052141055X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The surveyor who measured the land for the map could typically survey {{convert|20 |acres}} per day and was paid 6d per acre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Essex on the Map|publisher=Essex County Council|year=1990|first=A Stuart|last=Mason|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
Estate maps were colourful and often intended for display as well as estate management. "They were drawn and decorated by country surveyors for the information and pleasure of country squires."&lt;ref&gt;Edward Lynham in {{cite book|title=Catalogue of maps in the Essex Record Office |editor-first=F. G. |editor-last=Emmison |editor-link=F. G. Emmison |year=1947 |publisher=Essex County Council}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of scale was down to the individual map maker, but were usually large scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sarah |last=Bendall |chapter=Estate Maps |editor1-last=Wallis |editor1-first=Helen |editor1-link=Helen Wallis |editor2-last=McConnell |editor2-first=Anita |title=Historian's Guide to Early British Maps |publisher=[[Royal Historical Society]] |place=London |year=1994 |ISBN=0521551528 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buildings (and trees) were often shown as miniature pictures (in what is sometimes termed a "[[Bird's-eye view#Bird's-flight view|bird's-flight view]]") in early maps, although from the 18th century it became common to depict buildings in plan. "Few land surveyors even attempted to show relief; it was not essential to their purpose of recording boundaries and areas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Stacey |last=Gee |title=Estate Maps at Guildhall Library |publisher=Guildhall Library Manuscripts Section |origyear=2004 |year=2006 |url=http://www.history.ac.uk/gh/Estate.htm |accessdate=11 March 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They often had elaborate cartouches giving the name of the estate owner. Typically, little or no detail is shown for land not owned by the person or organisation commissioning the map. Estate maps were frequently accompanied by field books that contained the key to symbols on the map and had information about tenants and crops. Where the field book has not survived, the usefulness of the map is greatly diminished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Essex on the Map |last=Mason |first=A. Stuart |year=1990 |publisher=Essex Record Office |place=Chelmsford |isbn= 0-900360-75-5 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
Large numbers of estate maps are found in [[county record office]]s, having been deposited with the accumulated documents of a landed family. Where the estate owner was a corporate body – an [[Oxbridge]] college or a City [[livery company]], for example – their estate maps remain in their own archives. Some estate maps are held in [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] – for example where the estate was owned by [[the Crown]], or when it has been the subject of a court case.

==Usage==
Originally, estate maps served two purposes. They were a tool that enabled estate owners to manage and improve their property. In addition they were status symbols that enabled a landowner to display the extent of his property ownership and his authority over his property. Surveying texts became explicit about the need to decorate the maps in a way that emphasised the status of the owner – by the use of [[coat of arms|coats of arms]] or depiction of the [[manor house]].

Today, estate maps can be used to investigate land usage and changes in river channels, as well as in [[Conservation and restoration of historic gardens|historic garden conservation]] and other historical interest in [[English country house]]s. An estate map is often useful in determining the history of [[field systems]], as it can be the earliest written evidence of the field system in use in a locality.

[[Rhetoric]] theorist Jane Donawerth identifies Hartley's ''The Ladies’ Book of Etiquette''{{r|Hartley-1860}} as part of a distinctive self-consciously feminine discursive tradition of [[conduct book]] rhetoric, developed in the 18th and 19th centuries.{{r|Donawerth-2012|p=41–42}}{{r|Donawerth-2013|p=84}} Donawerth sees Hartley's work as marking the conservative end of the spectrum of works within this tradition, merging the [[conduct book]] tradition with the narrower tradition of the etiquette manual.{{r|Donawerth-2012|p=65–66}}{{r|Donawerth-2013|p=83}} Hartley sees good [[elocution]] as natural, not as an art, and avoids the use of the ''word'' [[wikt:elocution|''elocution'']]; she discourages women from speaking in such a way as to draw attention to themselves,{{r|Donawerth-2013|p=84}} or asking professional men (such as physicians, attorneys, artists, merchants, or mechanics) about the subject matter of their work.{{r|Johnson-2002|p=66}} Hartley admonishes women never to phrase what they say as assertions of fact, only as declarations of their own opinions.{{r|Johnson-2002|p=66}} She argues for women's education principally on the ground that it enables women to be better companions.{{r|Donawerth-2012|p=66}} Donawerth characterizes Hartley's etiquette as grounded in a profoundly conservative worldview based on wealth and social class.{{r|Donawerth-2012|p=66}} Hartley herself sees her etiquette as a logical extension of [[Christian ethics]], specifically, the [[Golden Rule]].{{r|Szczesiul-2017|p=57}}

Hartley's approach to etiquette strongly emphasized its role in hospitality. Of the 26 chapters in ''The Ladies’ Book of Etiquette'',{{r|Hartley-1860}} ten are devoted to the etiquette of the roles of guest or hostess.{{r|Szczesiul-2017|p=57}} Hartley also placed great emphasis on the etiquette of letter writing.{{r|Johnson-2002|p=91–93}}

=== Response ===

==== Nineteenth century ====

During Hartley's time, her work received favorable reviews, such as this one referring to ''The Ladies’ Book of Etiquette, and Manual of Politeness'':{{r|Hartley-1860}}
{{Quote
|text    = We should despair of any young lady who, having read this volume attentively, was not sufficiently polished to enter the very best society.
|source  = ''The Crayon'' (November 1860){{r|Crayon-1860-11}}
}}

==== Twentieth and twenty-first centuries ====

Present-day reception of Hartley's work has been mixed. Journalist Tanya Sweeney describes ''The Ladies’ Book of Etiquette'' as the "definitive tome" of 19th-century etiquette.{{r|Sweeney-2014-12-09}} According to journalist Jessica Leigh Hester, Hartley's 19th-century etiquette advice can still be instructive in the 21st century, particularly in regard to [[RSVP (invitations)|RSVPs]], tasteful dress, avoidance of gossip in places where it can easily be overheard, and loud amateur music at parties.{{r|Hester-2015-12-02}} On the other hand, food and travel writer Anna Brones ridicules Hartley's dictum that a good hostess should not discuss, or even notice, what her guests are eating.{{r|Brones-2014-12-18}} Historian C. Dallett Hemphill sees Hartley's conservative approach to etiquette as having "nativist or racist roots".{{r|Hemphill-1999|p=141}}

Donawerth notes that Hartley never acknowledges the etiquette writers before her. When Hartley tells readers that
: politeness is as necessary to a happy intercourse with the inhabitants of the kitchen, as with those of the parlour; it lessens the pains of service, promotes kind feelings on both sides, and checks unbecoming familiarity{{r|Hartley-1860}}

she is directly quoting [[Eliza Ware Farrar]]'s ''The Young Lady's Friend''{{r|Farrar-1838}} without credit.{{r|Donawerth-2012|p=66}}

== Needlework ==

Hartley's ''Ladies’ Hand Book of Fancy and Ornamental Work'' offered instruction in a wide variety of types of [[needlework]], including sewing, knitting, and quilting.{{r|Hartley-1859}}{{r|Shrock-2004|p=136}} Just as with etiquette, Hartley saw skill in needlework as essential to a lady's education, with implications for her overall happiness and for her usefulness to, and acceptance within, society.{{r|Woodard-and-Greenstein-1993|p=10}}

== Women's health ==

Hartley was an advocate of more healthful practices for women, and a critic of social customs that she saw as jeopardizing [[women's health]].{{r|Wagner-1997|p=176}} Despite the conservatism of her general approach to etiquette, Hartley denounced the [[corset]], which some other early women writers on etiquette defended.{{r|Donawerth-2013|p=82–83}} She saw young women of her day as less healthy than their mothers and grandmothers. Hartley warned young women against the practice of staying late at [[Ball (dance party)|dance balls]], so that they would not be utterly exhausted when they left, and would not miss breakfast the next morning. She advocated walking 4–5 miles per day for vigorous young women, as an alternative to dancing in overheated ballrooms.{{r|Wagner-1997|p=176}}

'''Form-versus-content humour''' is a type of [[humour]] in an [[:wikt:incongruity|incongruity]] between a statement's content and the way it is communicated makes it humorous. It is one of the basic techniques of [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] humour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How to Laugh Your Way Through Life: A Psychoanalyst's Advice |first=Paul |last=Marcus |publisher=Karnac Books |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[form and content|Form-versus-content]] humour can be delivered, for example, by presenting a message in a form that inherently defeats the ostensible purpose of the message, or in a form that is fundamentally incapable of carrying the important part of the message. The ''[[Jargon File]]'' gives an example of this type of humor: a red [[index card]] with GREEN written on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/h/hackerhumor.html |title=hacker humor |website=The Jargon File, version 4.4.8 |editor=Eric S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3560">'''Green Hour''' is a core concept of the U.S. [[National Wildlife Federation]]'s '''Be Out There''' campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwf.org/Be-Out-There.aspx NWF's "Be Out There" program website]&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was created in response to a growing disconnect between nature and children, a condition dubbed [[nature deficit disorder]] by Richard Louv&lt;ref&gt;[http://richardlouv.com/ Author Richard Louv's website]&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''[[Last Child in the Woods]]''. One of the primary symptoms of nature deficit disorder, according to Louv, is the replacement of outdoor activities (or "green time") with "screen time"—hours that are spent in front of computers, televisions and other electronic devices.

The [[National Wildlife Federation]] recommends that parents give their kids a "Green Hour" every day, a time for unstructured play and interaction with the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwf.org/Be-Out-There/Why-Be-Out-There.aspx NWF's "Why Be Out There" web page]&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of NWF's strategy called [[Reversing Nature Deficit]]. The Green Hour program teaches that unstructured play can take place in a garden, a backyard, a nearby park, or any place that provides safe and accessible green spaces where children can learn and play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/360/story/551908.html Miami Herald article about Green Hour]&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Hour's web site was launched by NWF's Education department in March 2007 as a resource for parents and caregivers, attempting to provide the information, inspiration, tools and community needed to make "green hours" part of every family's daily routine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/18/AR2007061801808_pf.html Washington Post article about Green Hour]&lt;/ref&gt; Green Hour cites a Kaiser Family Foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kff.org/ Kaiser Family Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; study which found the average American child spends 44 hours per week-more than six hours per day-staring at some kind of electronic screen. Studies have also linked excessive television viewing to obesity, violence, and even lower intelligence in kids.

Each week, Green Hour publishes a new issue of its Discovery Journal with a new outdoor theme. The Journal has several tabs: "Book Nook," which provides reading for kids of different ages, "Make &amp; Do," which provides outdoor activities and crafts and "Did You Know." which provides facts about nature.

The Green Hour blog&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenhour.org/content/blog NWF's Green Hour Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; presents different perspectives on the rise in children's "screen-time" and practical ways of reconnecting youth to nature. The Green Hour Community Corner&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenhour.org/content/community NWF's Green Hour Community Corner]&lt;/ref&gt; allow users to sign up as members and talk with other parents and caregivers. NatureFind&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwf.org/NatureFind.aspx NWF's Green Hour NatureFind]&lt;/ref&gt; is a feature on the site that allows users to submit their zip code and find all the parks, trails and other natural areas nearby.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16007">The H-500 project is an outline planning scheme in accordance with the Planning and Building Law for South [[Holon]], [[Israel]]. The area of the project is approximately 4,080 dunams and it is the largest, undeveloped land reserve remaining in Holon. The scheme is bounded in the north by Sderot Yerushalayim and the Kiryat Sharet and Kiryat Pinhas Ayalon neighbourhoods, in the east by Highway no. 4, in the south by the border with the city of [[Rishon LeZion]] and in the west by [[Highway 20 (Israel)]] (the Ayalon Highway).

== General Background ==
The scheme (Holon H-500) adapts the land zoning, and the deployment and height of construction, to the restrictions deriving from NOPS 2/4 (the National Outline Planning Scheme for the development of [[Ben Gurion Airport]]), which fixed the location of the flight paths adjacent to and above the site of the H-500 scheme. The restrictions deriving from the Airport's activity are expressed in a limit of the final height of the buildings in the project (a maximum of 22 stories), height limits for masts and antennas and also restrictions relating to the erection of cranes during construction. In addition, the use of acoustic elements for noise insulation is prescribed, as are provisions intended to minimise the hazards deriving from flying birds that might endanger passing aircraft.

According to the scheme, in the version that has been deposited (Holon H-500), a green area of 1,200 dunams or thereabouts is planned for the development of a metropolitan sand dune park at the centre of the site. The centre of the park, which is called the "preserved heart", will include an area of not less than 400 dunams of natural sand dunes in order to preserve the unique ecology that includes a wide range of rare plants, the like of which is not to be found elsewhere along the coast. The ring around the "preserved heart" will form the outer envelope of the park and will be zoned for municipal recreation and leisure activity.

Further to the hearing of oppositions to the deposited version of the scheme (Holon H-500), the district planning and building committee decided to extend the "preserved heart" of the park at the expense of the area for future planning. The 1,500 dwelling units that were allotted in an area for future planning according to the deposited version of the scheme were moved by the district committee's decision to the residential domains, so that their allotment will not be dependent on changes to the Airport flight paths.

== Milestones in the Holon H-500 scheme approval proceedings ==
* Notice of the scheme's preparation and the conditions for the issue of building permits during the interim three-year period according to sections 77 and 78 of the Planning and Building Law was first published in the press on August 10–11, 2006 and in Government Notices no. 5562 of August 2, 2006.
* Notice of an extension of the time for the issue of conditional building permits during the interim period, for one year or until the scheme's deposit, according to section 78 of the Planning and Building Law was published in Government Notices no. 6080 of April 28, 2010.
* Notice of the scheme's deposit in accordance with section 89 of the Planning and Building Law was published in Government Notices no. 6444 of July 11, 2012.
* The decision of the district planning and building committee (the opposition subcommittee) to ratify the Holon H-500 scheme was made on February 18, 2013.
* The decision of the appeal subcommittee of the national council to approve the scheme was made on May 14, 2014.
* The decision of the district planning and building committee (the opposition subcommittee) to ratify the scheme, subject to technical modifications and transitional provisions to permit the existing uses until the preparation of detailed plans, was made on October 12, 2015.

== Building rights – quantitative data of the Holon H-500 scheme ==
* 1,300 low-rise dwelling units
* 12,400 high-rise dwelling units (including 1,500 dwelling units that were moved from the area for future planning that was cancelled in order to increase the size of the sand dune park), of which 2,000 are small dwelling units of 80 m² each, including safe room, for eligible persons.
* 13,700 dwelling units in total (including 800 for encouragement and assistance in the elimination of nuisances and the removal of squatters).
* 930,000 m² (principal area) for employment of various types, including commercial and multipurpose zoning.
* 175,000 m² (principal area) for public buildings.

== The main provisions of the Holon H-500 scheme ==
* A condition for the approval of an initial detailed plan will be the approval of a scheme incorporating division into different domains for consolidation and partition or a plan including such partition as part of, or contemporaneously with, the initial detailed plan ("the domains scheme").
* The domains scheme will prescribe the division of building rights between the domains, the conditions for realisation of the rights in each individual domain and provisions for consolidation and partition that will include reference to the division of public areas.
* The domains scheme will amongst other things prescribe the area of the park that will be included in the various different detailed plans, with reference to the part of the park located in each domain, provided that complete development of the whole park is ensured.

== History ==
The sand dunes of South Holon have been a focus of real estate activity since the beginning of the last century. At that time, before the establishment of the Holon Local Council, the area was defined as being under galilee jurisdiction, that is to say that it was not under the jurisdiction of any local authority, adjacent to the Arab village of Yazur. The first outline scheme that was prepared for the area by the planning agencies during the British Mandate was called the "Agrobank And Neighbourhood Regional Outline Road Scheme".

The scheme was provisionally approved on October 30, 1939 and finally on January 14, 1942 (its approval was published in the Official Gazette, no. 1164). The purpose of the scheme was to delineate the road network for the new neighbourhoods that were to be built around the Agrobank neighbourhood, situated to the north, adjacent to [[Mikveh Israel]].

In the 1930s private individuals and commercial companies started buying large tracts of land totalling hundreds of dunams from the Arab landowners. Parcellation plans were prepared in accordance with the Mandatory City Building Ordinance, which divided the large tracts of land into small parcels of between 300 and 500 m² each, creating neighbourhoods that incorporated roads and plots for public purposes, in conformity with the Mandatory outline scheme for Holon, R/128, the preparation of which began in the early 1940s

The parcels resulting from the parcellation plans were entered in the Land Registers and came to be traded on the open market in Israel and also abroad. At that time great importance was attached to the redemption of the land and for that reason many parcels were bought by the Jews of Europe, USA and South Africa, with the assistance of public leaders who were harnessed to the task on visiting Jewish communities abroad. Thus, for example, Dr Haim Kugel, who went on to become the first Mayor of Holon, helped in the land redemption when he visited the Jewish community in South Africa. For that reason there are still many owners (the heirs of the original owners) of land within the boundaries of the scheme who are non-residents.

The following are examples of the historical parcellation of land in South Holon:

* The creation of blocks 6747, 6748, 6749 and 6750 by the Agricultural and Building Bank for Palestine Ltd
* The partition of parcel 690 in block 6043 by the Land and Loan Company Ltd.

The first outline planning scheme for the City of Holon, H/1, dating from 1958, cancelled all the Mandatory plans for the construction of new residential neighbourhoods in South Holon and zoned the whole area for planning again as an "area for reparcellation" (fresh consolidation and partition). The H-500 scheme is the third and most recent of the outline planning schemes (following H/1 and Amendment no. 3 to H/1) and it proposes a new planning scheme for the whole area.

== The Moledet Neighbourhood ==
The Moledet neighbourhood is included within the boundaries of the H-500 scheme in the area that is zoned for the sand dune park. The neighbourhood was established in 1930 as the first residential suburb of South Holon and it is one of the first five neighbourhoods (together with Agrobank, Greene, Kiryat Avoda and Am) that combined into the Holon Local Council in 1940.

The Moledet land was purchased by a company called Hamizrach, headed by the engineer, Alexander Hissin. The centre of the neighbourhood was the Water Tower. The first residents were eight immigrant families from Yemen but by the end of 1934, just four years later, the population of the neighbourhood had reached about 100 families.

Because of Moledet's remoteness from other Jewish settlements and its proximity to the Arab villages of Yazur and Bayt Dajan, the neighbourhood was attacked by Arabs from Jaffa in the great Arab revolt between 1936 and 1939 and almost completely abandoned. Its residents went to live temporarily at the Mikveh Israel Agricultural School.

The Security Road, which was paved in 1948 as an alternative to the Jaffa – Jerusalem Road (now Highway no. 44), with the object of connecting Tel Aviv to the settlements of the South and Jerusalem, ran through Moledet.

Dozens of families now live in Moledet, alongside a few businesses and workshops. All the buildings in the neighbourhood, apart from the Water Tower and Security Road that have been zoned for preservation, are to be cleared according to the H-500 scheme (see below – the Clearance of Givat Holon and Moledet).

== The Givat Holon Neighborhood ==
Givat Holon is located within the boundaries of the H-500 scheme in the area that is zoned for the sand dune park. This small suburb is located to the south of Kiryat Sharet in the heart of the sand dune area, alongside the road leading to the site of the municipal abattoir.

Givat Holon includes several dozen homes. The buildings were constructed at the beginning of the 1940s and remain in their original format. Although according to outline scheme H/1 (Amendment no. 3), which was approved in 1978, the area was zoned as residential, in order to enlarge construction in the area it was necessary to prepare a detailed plan. Because of the limitations deriving from the neighbourhood's location in the area affected by the Airport, it was not possible to develop the neighborhood and it has therefore remained in its original state, without modern infrastructure.

The residents of Givat Holon took legal proceedings against Holon Municipality and in June 2014 they were awarded judgement requiring the Municipality to grant them proper municipal services, like garbage removal and the provision of refuse bins, and the installation of lampposts and street signs.

Givat Holon is due to be cleared as part of the H-500 scheme (see below – the Clearance of Givat Holon and Moledet).

== The Abattoir ==
The Abattoir tract is a 254 dunam piece of land that is included in the H-500 scheme. The land was expropriated from private owners in 1961 further to authority obtained by the Mayor of Holon in accordance with the Land Ordinance for the establishment of a regional abattoir and associated industrial facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/b3858e_9a8d0aa430ce481eb5324ac8322f97d0.pdf/ |title=A letter of the mayor of Holon written on Feb. 14, 1960, regarding getting permission to expropriate land for the making of the regional Abattoir|publisher=Joseph Raiten, The Holon H-500 Trade Arena}}&lt;/ref&gt; To that end a joint company was established by the Tel Aviv and Holon Municipalities (80% Tel Aviv and 20% Holon) in order to promote the venture and bear its costs, including the compensation payable to the private landowners.

Further to the expropriation proceedings, in 1966 a town planning scheme (H-142) for the construction of an abattoir and associated industries was approved. According to the scheme it was permitted to build an abattoir and meat processing facilities.

The aforegoing might today sound like a figment of the imagination: to expropriate 250 dunams of land for an abattoir in the sandhills of South Holon, big enough to serve the whole Middle East. Nevertheless, at that time, the venture did appear to justify such a large-scale expropriation. Not one of the private landowners objected to the venture and even had anyone objected, it is doubtful whether he would have had any chance of succeeding against Holon's then legendary mayor, Pinchas Ayalon.

In fact, apart from one building that was constructed at the end of the 1960s, which served as a municipal abattoir until the beginning of the 1990s, the rest of the land remained empty and undeveloped. The abattoir building was blown up in June 2015 as part of an exercise by the Home Front Command.

The landowners in the abattoir domain, Tel Aviv and Holon Municipalities, are expected to obtain rights in the scope of the H-500 scheme for the clearance of the abattoir (section 2.2.4 of the scheme regulations).

== The Clearance of Givat Holon and Moledet ==
The H-500 scheme lays down directions for the preservation of the Security Road and the historic sites associated with it in accordance with the municipal preservation plan. The scheme nevertheless prescribes the clearance of Givat Holon and Moledet because of the limitations of using the area, which is affected by the flight paths according to the Ben Gurion Airport national outline scheme. After clearance, the neighborhoods will become part of the municipal sand dune park.

The deposited plan contains merely general provisions for the compensation of the residents of Moledet, the clearance to be financed from building rights that have been allotted specifically for the purpose, totalling 800 dwelling units (designated for the clearance of three centres: the refuse site, the abattoir and Moledet). The scheme further provides that the total compensation will be determined by a real estate appraiser to be appointed by the local planning and building committee.

Further to appeals that were filed against the district planning and building committee's decision (which the residents of Givat Holon also joined), which culminated in the decision of the appeal subcommittee of the national council of May 15, 2014, several operative decisions were made in respect of the clearance of Givat Holon (from which inferences may be drawn in respect of the clearance of Moledet) as follows:

* The clearance of the existing residents will be effected in consolidation and partition proceedings in accordance with the detailed plan, in which the area will be zoned for the park. The residents will be allotted other land in accordance with the relevant provisions of law.
* Until the clearance of Givat Holon it will be possible to continue using the existing lawful buildings for residential purposes.
* So long as residential use continues in Givat Holon, the issue of building permits for the renovation (not including extension) of existing buildings will be permitted by virtue of existing permits.
* The residents will obtain their rights in the scope of the first plan that is approved by virtue of the H-500 scheme.
* Clearance will only be effected when the implementation of the first detailed plan commences or at such other time as it prescribes.

{{Anthropology }}

'''History of anthropology'scientific word during the [[Renaissance]], has always meant "the study (or science) of man". The topics to be included and the terminology have varied historically. At present they are more elaborate than they were during the development of anthropology. For a presentation of modern social and cultural anthropology as they have developed in Britain, France, and North America since approximately 1900, see the relevant sections under [[Anthropology]].

==Etymology==
The term ''[[wiktionary:anthropology|anthropology]]'' ostensibly is a produced compound of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ἄνθρωπος}} ''anthrōpos'', "human being" (understood to mean "humankind" or "humanity"), and a supposed -λογία ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]'', "study".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=-logy | work=Online Etymological Dictionary | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=-logy&amp;allowed_in_frame=0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compound, however, is unknown in ancient Greek or Latin, whether classical or mediaeval. It first appears sporadically in the scholarly Latin ''anthropologia'' of Renaissance France, where it spawns the French word ''anthropologie'', transferred into English as anthropology. It does belong to a class of words produced with the [[-logy]] suffix, such as archeo-logy, bio-logy, etc., "the study (or science) of".

The mixed character of Greek ''anthropos'' and Latin ''-logia'' marks it as [[New Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=-logy | encyclopedia=Webster's Third New International Dictionary Unabridged and Seven Language Dictionary | volume=II H to R | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no independent noun, logia, however, of that meaning in classical Greek. The word λόγος ([[logos]]) has that meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1940|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dlo%2Fgos logos]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]] attempted to rescue the etymology in his first address to the [[Anthropological Society of London]] as president and founder, 1863. He did find an ''anthropologos'' from Aristotle in the standard [[A Greek–English Lexicon|ancient Greek Lexicon]], which he says defines the word as "speaking or treating of man".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hunt|1863|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is entirely wishful thinking, as Liddell and Scott go on to explain the meaning: "i.e. fond of personal conversation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1940|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aalphabetic+letter%3D*a%3Aentry+group%3D178%3Aentry%3Da%29nqrwpolo%2Fgos anthropologos]}}&lt;/ref&gt; If Aristotle, the very philosopher of the logos, could produce such a word without serious intent, there probably was at that time no anthropology identifiable under that name.

The lack of any ancient denotation of anthropology, however, is not an etymological problem. Liddell and Scott list 170 Greek compounds ending in ''–logia'', enough to justify its later use as a productive suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Liddell|Scott|1940|loc=[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/resolveform?type=end&amp;lookup=logia&amp;lang=greek logia]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Greeks often used suffixes in forming compounds that had no independent variant.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buck|1933|p=359}}&lt;/ref&gt; The etymological dictionaries are united in attributing ''–logia'' to ''logos'', from ''legein'', "to collect". The thing collected is primarily ideas, especially in speech. The [[American Heritage Dictionary]] says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=leg- | encyclopedia=[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] | edition=4th | chapter=Appendix I: Indo-European Roots | year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "(It is one of) derivatives independently built to logos." Its morphological type is that of an abstract noun: log-os &gt; log-ia (a "qualitative abstract")&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buck|1933|p=347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Renaissance]] origin of the name of anthropology does not exclude the possibility that ancient authors presented anthropogical material under another name (see below). Such an identification is speculative, depending on the theorist's view of anthropology; nevertheless, speculations have been formulated by credible anthropologists, especially those that consider themselves [[Structural functionalism|functionalists]] and others in history so classified now.

==The science of history==
[[Marvin Harris]], a historian of anthropology, begins ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory'' with the statement that anthropology is "the science of history".&lt;ref name=Harris1&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is not suggesting that [[history]] be renamed to anthropology, or that there is no distinction between history and [[prehistory]], or that anthropology excludes current social practices, as the general meaning of history, which it has in "history of anthropology", would seem to imply. He is using "history" in a special sense, as the founders of [[cultural anthropology]] used it:&lt;ref&gt;There is currently some regional and traditional equivocation about whether it should be called culture history, as in [[cultural anthropology]]; i.e., [[Culture-historical archaeology]], or [[social history]], as in [[social anthropology]], or the compromise, [[sociocultural anthropology]]. Different theorists have different practices, the distinctions being mainly verbal.&lt;/ref&gt; "the natural history of society", in the words of [[Herbert Spencer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "universal history of mankind", the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment]] objective.&lt;ref name=Harris1/&gt; Just as [[natural history]] comprises the characteristics of organisms past and present, so cultural or social history comprises the characteristics of society past and present. It includes both documented history and prehistory, but its slant is toward institutional development rather than particular non-repeatable historical events.

According to Harris, the 19th-century anthropologists were theorizing under the presumption that the development of society followed some sort of laws. He decries the loss of that view in the 20th century by the denial that any laws are discernable or that current institutions have any bearing on ancient. He coins the term ideographic for them. The 19th-century views, on the other hand, are [[nomothetic]]; that is, they provide laws. He intends "to reassert the methodological priority of the search for the laws of history in the science of man".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is looking for "a general theory of history".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; His perception of the laws: "I believe that the analogue of the Darwinian strategy in the realm of sociocultural phenomena is the principle of techno-environmental and techno-economic determinism", he calls [[Cultural materialism (anthropology)|cultural materialism]], which he also details in ''Cultural Materialism: The Struggle for a Science of Culture.''

Elsewhere he refers to "my theories of historical determinism", defining the latter: "By a deterministic relationship among cultural phenomena, I mean merely that similar variables under similar conditions tend to give rise to similar consequences."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1991|pp=xii-xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of "tends to" implies some degree of freedom to happen or not happen, but in strict [[determinism]], given certain causes, the result and only that result must occur. Different philosophers, however, use determinism in different senses. The deterministic element that Harris sees is lack of human social engineering: "free will and moral choice have had virtually no significant effect upon the direction taken thus far by evolving systems of social life."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1991|p=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harris agrees with the 19th-century view that laws are [[abstraction]]s from [[empirical evidence]]: "...sociocultural entities are constructed from the direct or indirect observation of the behavior and thought of specific individuals&amp;nbsp;...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1999|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutions are not a physical reality; only people are. When they act in society, they do so according to the laws of history, of which they are not aware; hence, there is no historical element of free will. Like the 20th-century anthropologists in general, Harris places a high value on the empiricism, or collection of data. This function must be performed by trained observers.

He borrows terms from linguistics: just as a [[phonetics|phon-'''etic''' system]] is a description of sounds developed without regard to the meaning and structure of the language, while a [[phoneme|phon-'''emic''']] system describes the meaningful sounds actually used within the language, so anthropological data can be [[emic and etic]]. Only trained observers can avoid eticism, or description without regard to the meaning in the culture: "...&amp;nbsp;etics are in part observers' emics incorrectly applied to a foreign system...."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1999|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He makes a further distinction between [[Synchrony and diachrony|synchronic and diachronic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2001|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Synchronic ("same time") with reference to anthropological data is contemporaneous and cross-cultural. Diachronic ("through time") data shows the development of lines through time. Cultural materialism, being a "processually holistic and globally comparative scientific research strategy" must depend for accuracy on all four types of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|1999|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural materialism differs from the others by the insertion of culture as the effect. Different material factors produce different cultures.

Harris, like many other anthropologists, in looking for anthropological method and data before the use of the term anthropology, had little difficulty finding them among the ancient authors. The ancients tended to see players on the stage of history as ethnic groups characterized by the same or similar languages and customs: the Persians, the Germans, the Scythians, etc. Thus the term history meant to a large degree the "story" of the fortunes of these players through time. The ancient authors never formulated laws. Apart from a rudimentary [[three-age system]], the stages of history, such as are found in Lubbock, Tylor, Morgan, Marx and others, are yet unformulated.

==Proto-anthropology==
Eriksen and Nielsen use the term proto-anthropology to refer to near-anthropological writings, which contain some of the criteria for being anthropology, but not all. They classify proto-anthropology as being "travel writing or social philosophy", going on to assert "It is only when these aspects&amp;nbsp;... are fused, that is, when data and theory are brought together, that anthropology appears."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Thomas Hylland | last1=Eriksen | first2=Finn Sivert | last2=Nielsen | title=A History of Anthropology | edition=2nd | series=Anthropology, Culture and Society Series | location=London | publisher=Pluto Press | year=1013 | pages=10–12 | url=http://hyllanderiksen.net/History2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process began to occur in the 18th century of the [[Age of Enlightenment]].

===Classical Age===
Many anthropological writers find anthropological-quality theorizing in the works of [[Classical Greece]] and [[Classical Rome]]; for example, [[John Myres]] in ''Herodotus and Anthropology'' (1908); E. E. Sikes in ''The Anthropology of the Greeks'' (1914); [[Clyde Kluckhohn]] in ''Anthropology and the Classics'' (1961), and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Jonathan Z. | last=Smith | title=Map is Not Territory: Studies in the History of Religions | location=Chicage | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=1993 | page=245}}&lt;/ref&gt; An equally long list may be found in French and German as well as other languages.

====Herodotus====
[[Herodotus]] was a 5th-century BC Greek historian who set about to chronicle and explain the [[Greco-Persian Wars]] that transpired early in that century. He did so in a surviving work conventionally termed ''the History'' or ''the Histories''. His first line begins: "These are the researches of Herodotus of Halicarnassus&amp;nbsp;...."

The [[Achaemenid Empire]], deciding to bring Greece into its domain, conducted a massive invasion across the [[Bosphorus]] using multi-cultural troops raised from many different locations. They were decisively defeated by the Greek city-states. Herodotus was far from interested in only the non-repeatable events. He provides ethnic details and histories of the peoples within the empire and to the north of it, in most cases being the first to do so. His methods were reading accounts, interviewing witnesses, and in some cases taking notes for himself.

These "researches" have been considered anthropological since at least as early as the late 19th century. The title, "Father of History" (''pater historiae''), had been conferred on him probably by [[Cicero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=François | last=Hartog | title=The mirror of Herodotus : the representation of the other in the writing of history | series=New historicism, 5. | year=1988 | location=Berkeley | publisher=University of California Press | page=379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pointing out that [[John Myres]] in 1908 had believed that Herodotus was an anthropologist on a par with those of his own day, [[James M. Redfield]] asserts: "Herodotus, as we know, was both Father of History and Father of Anthropology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=James M. | last=Redfield | title=Herodotus the Tourist | journal=Classical Philology | year=1985 | volume=80 | pages=97–118 | url=https://courses.cit.cornell.edu/class3676/secure/Redfield.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus calls his method of travelling around taking notes "theorizing". Redfield translates it as "tourism" with a scientific intent. He identifies three terms of Herodotus as overlapping on culture: ''diaitia'', material goods such as houses and consumables; ''[[Ethos|ethea]]'', the mores or customs; and ''nomoi'', the authoritative precedents or [[law]]s.

====Tacitus====
The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] historian, [[Tacitus]], wrote many of our only surviving contemporary accounts of several ancient [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Germanic peoples]].

===Middle Ages===

Another candidate for one of the first scholars to carry out comparative ethnographic-type studies in person was the medieval [[Persian people|Persian]] scholar [[Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī]] in the eleventh century, who wrote about the peoples, customs, and religions of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. According to Akbar S. Ahmed, like modern anthropologists, he engaged in extensive [[participant observation]] with a given group of people, learnt their language and studied their primary texts, and presented his findings with [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] and [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutrality]] using [[Cross-cultural studies|cross-cultural comparisons]].&lt;ref name=Ahmed&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Ahmed | first1 = Akbar S. | year = 1984 | title = Al-Beruni: The First Anthropologist | url = | journal = RAIN | volume = 60 | issue = 60| pages = 9–10 | doi = 10.2307/3033407 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue, however, that he hardly can be considered an anthropologist in the conventional sense.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tapper (1995). "Islamic Anthropology" and the "Anthropology of Islam", ''Anthropological Quarterly'' '''68''' (3), Anthropological Analysis and Islamic Texts, p. 185-193.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote detailed comparative studies on the religions and cultures in the [[Middle East]], [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean]], and especially [[South Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1353/jhi.1998.0030 | last1 = Walbridge | first1 = J.

Medieval scholars may be considered forerunners of modern anthropology as well, insofar as they conducted or wrote detailed studies of the customs of peoples considered "different" from themselves in terms of geography. [[John of Plano Carpini]] reported of his stay among the [[Mongols]]. His report was unusual in its detailed depiction of a non-European culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/Publications/Source_pages/AnthroHist.htm Resources for a History of Anthropology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231041925/http://www.timothyjpmason.com/WebPages/Publications/Source_pages/AnthroHist.htm |date=2012-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marco Polo]]'s systematic observations of nature, anthropology, and geography are another example of studying human variation across space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tk421.net/essays/polo.html Marco Polo's Asia]&lt;/ref&gt; Polo's travels took him across such a diverse human landscape and his accounts of the peoples he met as he journeyed were so detailed that they earned for Polo the name "the father of modern anthropology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/sections/gad/history/011rowe.pdf The Renaissance Foundations of Anthropology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904194548/http://www.aaanet.org/sections/gad/history/011rowe.pdf |date=2012-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
{{See also|Bernardino de Sahagún}}
The first use of the term "anthropology" in English to refer to a natural science of humanity was apparently in [[Richard Harvey (astrologer)|Richard Harvey's]] 1593 ''Philadelphus, a defense of the legend of Brutus in British history'', which, includes the passage: "Genealogy or issue which they had, Artes which they studied, Actes which they did. This part of History is named Anthropology."

==The Enlightenment roots of the discipline==
[[File: Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|left|220px|Immanuel Kant (1724-1804)]]

Many scholars consider modern anthropology as an outgrowth of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] (1715–89),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=8407 http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=8407]&lt;/ref&gt; a period when Europeans attempted to study human behavior systematically, the known varieties of which had been increasing since the fifteenth century as a result of the [[first European colonization wave (15th century–19th century)|first European colonization wave]]. The traditions of [[jurisprudence]], history, [[philology]], and [[sociology]] then evolved into something more closely resembling the modern views of these disciplines and informed the development of the [[social sciences]], of which anthropology was a part.

It took [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724-1804) 25 years to write one of the first major treatises on anthropology, ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' (1798), which treats it as a branch of philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, Michel. "Introduction" to his 1961 translation of Kant's work, reprinted, [http://www.generation-online.org/p/fpfoucault1.htm Generation-online.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Kant is not generally considered to be a modern anthropologist, as he never left his region of Germany, nor did he study any cultures besides his own.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, Brian, and Kain, Patrick (eds.), Essays on Kant's Anthropology, Cambridge University Press, 2003, 278pp., {{ISBN|0-521-79038-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He did, however, begin teaching an annual course in anthropology in 1772.
Developments in the systematic study of ancient civilizations through the disciplines of [[Classics]] and [[Egyptology]] informed both archaeology and eventually social anthropology, as did the study of East and South Asian languages and cultures. At the same time, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers, such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~votruba/sstopics/slovaklawsonlanguage/Herder_on_Language.pdf | title = Herder on Language | last = Votruba | first = Martin | work = Slovak Studies Program | publisher = University of Pittsburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]], whose work formed the basis for the "culture concept", which is central to the discipline.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Institutionally, anthropology emerged from the development of [[natural history]] (expounded by authors such as [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]) that occurred during the European colonization of the seventeenth, eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Programs of ethnographic study originated in this era as the study of the "human primitives" overseen by colonial administrations.

There was a tendency in late eighteenth century Enlightenment thought to understand human society as natural phenomena that behaved according to certain principles and that could be observed empirically. In some ways, studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was not unlike studying the flora and fauna of those places.

Early anthropology was divided between proponents of [[unilineal evolution|unilinealism]], who argued that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process, from the most primitive to the most advanced, and various forms of non-lineal theorists, who tended to subscribe to ideas such as [[diffusionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. (1968) Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology. London: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Most nineteenth-century social theorists, including anthropologists, viewed non-European societies as windows onto the pre-industrial human past.

==Overview of the modern discipline==
Marxist anthropologist [[Eric Wolf]] once characterized anthropology as "the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the social sciences". Understanding how [[anthropology]] developed contributes to understanding how it fits into other academic disciplines.
Scholarly traditions of [[jurisprudence]], history, [[philology]] and [[sociology]] developed during this time and informed the development of the [[social sciences]] of which anthropology was a part. At the same time, the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] reaction to the Enlightenment produced thinkers such as [[Herder]] and later [[Wilhelm Dilthey]] whose work formed the basis for the culture concept which is central to the discipline.

These intellectual movements in part grappled with one of the greatest paradoxes of [[modernity]]: as the world is becoming smaller and more integrated, people's experience of the world is increasingly atomized and dispersed. As [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] observed in the 1840s:

{{Quotation|All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilized nations, by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones; industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, universal interdependence of nations.}}

Ironically, this universal interdependence, rather than leading to greater human solidarity, has coincided with increasing racial, ethnic, religious, and class divisions, and new—and to some confusing or disturbing—cultural expressions. These are the conditions of life with which people today must contend, but they have their origins in processes that began in the 16th century and accelerated in the 19th century.

Institutionally anthropology emerged from [[natural history]] (expounded by authors such as [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]]). This was the study of human beings—typically people living in European colonies. Thus studying the language, culture, physiology, and artifacts of European colonies was more or less equivalent to studying the flora and fauna of those places. It was for this reason, for instance, that [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] could write monographs on both ''The League of the Iroquois'' and ''The American Beaver and His Works''. This is also why the material culture of 'civilized' nations such as China have historically been displayed in fine arts museums alongside European art while artifacts from Africa or Native North American cultures were displayed in [[natural history museum]]s with dinosaur bones and nature dioramas. Curatorial practice has changed dramatically in recent years, and it would be wrong to see anthropology as merely an extension of colonial rule and European [[chauvinism]], since its relationship to [[imperialism]] was and is complex.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Drawing on the methods of the [[natural science]]s as well as developing new techniques involving not only structured interviews but unstructured "participant-observation"—and drawing on the new [[theory of evolution]] through [[natural selection]], they proposed the scientific study of a new object: "humankind", conceived of as a whole. Crucial to this study is the concept "culture", which anthropologists defined both as a universal capacity and propensity for social learning, thinking, and acting (which they see as a product of human evolution and something that distinguishes Homo sapiens—and perhaps all species of genus ''[[Hominoid|Homo]]''—from other species), and as a particular adaptation to local conditions that takes the form of highly variable beliefs and practices. Thus, "culture" not only transcends the opposition between nature and nurture; it transcends and absorbs the peculiarly European distinction between politics, religion, kinship, and the economy as autonomous domains. Anthropology thus transcends the divisions between the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities to explore the biological, linguistic, material, and symbolic dimensions of humankind in all forms.

==National anthropological traditions==
{{Main|History of anthropology by country}}

As academic disciplines began to differentiate over the course of the nineteenth century, anthropology grew increasingly distinct from the biological approach of natural history, on the one hand, and from purely historical or literary fields such as Classics, on the other. A common criticism was that many social sciences (such as economists, sociologists, and psychologists) in Western countries focused disproportionately on Western subjects, while anthropology focuseed disproportionately on the "other".&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, James and George E. Marcus (1986) Writing culture: the poetics and politics of ethnography. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
Museums such as the [[British Museum]] weren't the only site of anthropological studies: with the [[New Imperialism]] period, starting in the 1870s, [[zoo]]s became unattended "laboratories", especially the so-called "ethnological exhibitions" or "Negro villages". Thus, "savages" from the colonies were displayed, often nudes, in cages, in what has been called "[[human zoos]]". For example, in 1906, Congolese [[pygmy]] [[Ota Benga]] was put by anthropologist [[Madison Grant]] in a cage in the [[Bronx Zoo]], labelled "the missing link" between an orangutan and the "white race"—Grant, a renowned [[eugenicist]], was also the author of ''[[The Passing of the Great Race]]'' (1916). Such exhibitions were attempts to illustrate and prove in the same movement the validity of [[scientific racism]], which first formulation may be found in [[Arthur de Gobineau]]'s ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of Human Races]]'' (1853–55). In 1931, the [[Colonial Exhibition]] in Paris still displayed [[Kanaks]] from [[New Caledonia]] in the "indigenous village"; it received 24&amp;nbsp;million visitors in six months, thus demonstrating the popularity of such "human zoos".

Anthropology grew increasingly distinct from natural history and by the end of the nineteenth century the discipline began to crystallize into its modern form—by 1935, for example, it was possible for T.K. Penniman to write a history of the discipline entitled ''A Hundred Years of Anthropology''. At the time, the field was dominated by 'the comparative method'. It was assumed that all societies passed through a single evolutionary process from the most primitive to most advanced. Non-European societies were thus seen as evolutionary 'living fossils' that could be studied in order to understand the European past. Scholars wrote histories of prehistoric migrations which were sometimes valuable but often also fanciful. It was during this time that Europeans first accurately traced [[Polynesia]]n migrations across the [[Pacific Ocean]] for instance—although some of them believed it originated in [[Egypt]]. Finally, the concept of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] was actively discussed as a way to classify—and rank—human beings based on difference.

==== E.B. Tylor and James Frazer====
[[File:Edward Burnett Tylor.jpg|thumb|left|Sir E. B. Tylor (1832-1917), nineteenth-century British anthropologist]]
[[File:JamesGeorgeFrazer.jpg|thumb|right|Sir James George Frazer (1854-1941)]]

[[Edward Burnett Tylor]] (2 October 1832&amp;nbsp;– 2 January 1917) and [[James Frazer|James George Frazer]] (1 January 1854&amp;nbsp;– 7 May 1941) are generally considered the antecedents to modern [[social anthropology]] in Britain. Although Tylor undertook a field trip to [[Mexico]], both he and Frazer derived most of the material for their comparative studies through extensive reading, not [[fieldwork]], mainly the Classics (literature and history of Greece and Rome), the work of the early European folklorists, and reports from missionaries, travelers, and contemporaneous ethnologists.

Tylor advocated strongly for unilinealism and a form of "uniformity of mankind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaanet.org/gad/history/044stocking.pdf Stocking, George Jr. (1963) "Matthew Arnold, E. B. Tylor, and the Uses of Invention", ''American Anthropologist'', 65:783-799, 1963] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202133549/http://www.aaanet.org/gad/history/044stocking.pdf |date=2007-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tylor in particular laid the groundwork for theories of [[cultural diffusionism]], stating that there are three ways that different groups can have similar cultural forms or technologies: "independent invention, inheritance from ancestors in a distant region, transmission from one race {{sic}} to another".&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E. B. (1865) ''Researches into the early history of mankind the development of civilization.'' London: John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tylor formulated one of the early and influential anthropological conceptions of [[culture]] as "that complex whole, which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by [humans] as [members] of society".&lt;ref&gt;Tylor, E. B. (1871) ''Primitive culture: researches into the development of mythology, philosophy, religion, art, and custom''. 2 vols. London, John Murray.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Stocking notes, Tylor mainly concerned himself with describing and mapping the distribution of particular elements of culture, rather than with the larger function, and he generally seemed to assume a Victorian idea of progress rather than the idea of non-directional, multilineal cultural development proposed by later anthropologists.

Tylor also theorized about the origins of religious beliefs in human beings, proposing a theory of [[animism]] as the earliest stage, and noting that "religion" has many components, of which he believed the most important to be belief in supernatural beings (as opposed to moral systems, cosmology, etc.). Frazer, a Scottish scholar with a broad knowledge of Classics, also concerned himself with religion, myth, and magic. His comparative studies, most influentially in the numerous editions of ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', analyzed similarities in religious belief and symbolism globally. Neither Tylor nor Frazer, however, was particularly interested in [[fieldwork]], nor were they interested in examining how the cultural elements and institutions fit together. The Golden Bough was abridged drastically in subsequent editions after his first.

==== Bronislaw Malinowski and the British School ====
Toward the turn of the twentieth century, a number of anthropologists became dissatisfied with this categorization of cultural elements; historical reconstructions also came to seem increasingly speculative to them. Under the influence of several younger scholars, a new approach came to predominate among British anthropologists, concerned with analyzing how societies held together in the present ([[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] analysis, rather than [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] or historical analysis), and emphasizing long-term (one to several years) immersion fieldwork. [[Cambridge University]] financed a [[William Rivers#Torres Straits Expedition|multidisciplinary expedition]] to the [[Torres Strait Islands]] in 1898, organized by [[Alfred Cort Haddon]] and including a physician-anthropologist, [[William Rivers]], as well as a linguist, a botanist, and other specialists. The findings of the expedition set new standards for ethnographic description.

A decade and a half later, Polish anthropology student [[Bronisław Malinowski]] (1884–1942) was beginning what he expected to be a brief period of [[fieldwork]] in the old model, collecting lists of cultural items, when the outbreak of the First World War stranded him in [[New Guinea]]. As a subject of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] resident on a British colonial possession, he was effectively confined to New Guinea for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Malinowski, Bronisław (1967) ''A diary in the strict sense of the term''. New York, Harcourt, Brace &amp; World [1967]&lt;/ref&gt;

He made use of the time by undertaking far more intensive fieldwork than had been done by ''British'' anthropologists, and his classic ethnography, ''[[Argonauts of the Western Pacific]]'' (1922) advocated an approach to [[fieldwork]] that became standard in the field: getting "the native's point of view" through [[participant observation]]. Theoretically, he advocated a [[Structural functionalism|functionalist]] interpretation, which examined how social institutions functioned to satisfy individual needs.

British social anthropology had an expansive moment in the [[Interwar period]], with key contributions coming from the Polish-British [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Meyer Fortes]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Goody]] (1995) ''[http://www3.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521450489 The Expansive Moment: The Rise of Social Anthropology in Britain and Africa, 1918-1970] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106055917/http://www3.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521450489 |date=2007-11-06 }}'' review at {{jstor|646577}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. R. Radcliffe-Brown]] also published a seminal work in 1922. He had carried out his initial fieldwork in the [[Andaman Islands]] in the old style of historical reconstruction. However, after reading the work of French sociologists [[Émile Durkheim]] and [[Marcel Mauss]], Radcliffe-Brown published an account of his research (entitled simply ''The Andaman Islanders'') that paid close attention to the meaning and purpose of rituals and myths. Over time, he developed an approach known as [[structural functionalism]], which focused on how institutions in societies worked to balance out or create an equilibrium in the social system to keep it functioning harmoniously. (This contrasted with Malinowski's functionalism, and was quite different from the later French [[Structuralism#Structuralism in anthropology and sociology|structuralism]], which examined the conceptual structures in language and symbolism.)

Malinowski and Radcliffe-Brown's influence stemmed from the fact that they, like Boas, actively trained students and aggressively built up institutions that furthered their programmatic ambitions. This was particularly the case with Radcliffe-Brown, who spread his agenda for "Social Anthropology" by teaching at universities across the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]]. From the late 1930s until the postwar period appeared a string of monographs and edited volumes that cemented the paradigm of British Social Anthropology (BSA). Famous ethnographies include ''The Nuer,'' by [[Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard]], and ''The Dynamics of Clanship Among the Tallensi,'' by [[Meyer Fortes]]; well-known edited volumes include ''African Systems of Kinship and Marriage'' and ''African Political Systems.''

==== Post WW II trends ====
[[Max Gluckman]], together with many of his colleagues at the [[Rhodes-Livingstone Institute]] and students at [[Manchester University]], collectively known as the [[Manchester School (anthropology)|Manchester School]], took BSA in new directions through their introduction of explicitly Marxist-informed theory, their emphasis on conflicts and conflict resolution, and their attention to the ways in which individuals negotiate and make use of the social structural possibilities.

In Britain, anthropology had a great intellectual impact, it "contributed to the erosion of [[Christianity]], the growth of [[cultural relativism]], an awareness of the survival of the primitive in modern life, and the replacement of [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] modes of analysis with [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]], all of which are central to modern culture."&lt;ref name="Heyck1997"&gt;Heyck, Thomas William (1997) at The American Historical Review, Vol. 102, No. 5 (December, 1997), pp. 1486–1488 {{doi|10.2307/2171126}} {{jstor|2171126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the 1960s and 1970s, [[Edmund Leach]] and his students [[Mary Douglas]] and [[Nur Yalman]], among others, introduced French structuralism in the style of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]]; while British anthropology has continued to emphasize social organization and economics over purely symbolic or literary topics, differences among British, French, and American sociocultural anthropologies have diminished with increasing dialogue and borrowing of both theory and methods. Today, social anthropology in Britain engages internationally with many other social theories and has branched in many directions.

In countries of the British Commonwealth, social anthropology has often been institutionally separate from [[physical anthropology]] and [[primatology]], which may be connected with departments of biology or zoology; and from archaeology, which may be connected with departments of [[Classics]], [[Egyptology]], and the like. In other countries (and in some, particularly smaller, British and North American universities), anthropologists have also found themselves institutionally linked with scholars of [[folklore]], [[Museology|museum studies]], [[human geography]], [[sociology]], [[social relations]], [[ethnic studies]], [[cultural studies]], and [[social work]].

Anthropology has been used in Britain to provide an alternative explanation for the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010]] to the technical explanations rooted in economic and political theory. Dr. [[Gillian Tett]], a [[Cambridge University]] trained anthropologist who went on to become a senior editor at the [[Financial Times]] is one of the leaders in this use of anthropology.

===Canada===
Canadian anthropology began, as in other parts of the Colonial world, as ethnological data in the records of travellers and missionaries. In Canada, [[Jesuit]] [[Missionary|missionaries]] such as Fathers LeClercq, Le Jeune and Sagard, in the 17th century, provide the oldest ethnographic records of native tribes in what was then the Dominion of Canada. The academic discipline has drawn strongly on both the British Social Anthropology and the American Cultural Anthropology traditions, producing a hybrid "Socio-cultural" anthropology.

==== George Mercer Dawson ====
True anthropology began with a [[Government agency|Government department]]: the [[Geological Survey of Canada]], and [[George Mercer Dawson]] (director in 1895). Dawson's support for anthropology created impetus for the profession in Canada. This was expanded upon by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, who established a Division of Anthropology within the Geological Survey in 1910.

==== Edward Sapir ====
Anthropologists were recruited from England and the USA, setting the foundation for the unique Canadian style of anthropology. Scholars include the linguist and Boasian [[Edward Sapir]].

===France===
[[File:Emile Durkheim.jpg|thumb|[[Émile Durkheim]]]]
Anthropology in France has a less clear genealogy than the British and American traditions, in part because many French writers influential in anthropology have been trained or held faculty positions in sociology, philosophy, or other fields rather than in anthropology.

==== Marcel Mauss ====
Most commentators consider [[Marcel Mauss]] (1872–1950), nephew of the influential sociologist [[Émile Durkheim]], to be the founder of the French anthropological tradition. Mauss belonged to Durkheim's ''[[Année Sociologique]]'' group. While Durkheim and others examined the state of modern societies, Mauss and his collaborators (such as [[Henri Hubert]] and [[Robert Hertz]]) drew on ethnography and philology to analyze societies that were not as 'differentiated' as European nation states.

Two works by Mauss in particular proved to have enduring relevance: ''[[The Gift (book)|Essay on the Gift]],'' a seminal analysis of [[trade|exchange]] and [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]], and his Huxley lecture on the notion of the person, the first comparative study of notions of person and selfhood cross-culturally.&lt;ref&gt;Mauss, Marcel (1938) "A category of the human mind: the notion of person; the notion of self", in M. Carrithers, S. Collins, and S. Lukes, eds. ''The Category of the Person: anthropology, philosophy, history''. Pp. 1-25. Cambridge/New York: Cambridge University Press. Originally given as "Une categorie de l'Esprit Humain: La Notion de Personne, Celle de 'Moi'", for the Huxley Memorial Lecture and appeared in the ''Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute'', 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the interwar years, French interest in anthropology often dovetailed with wider cultural movements such as [[surrealism]] and [[primitivism (art movement)|primitivism]], which drew on ethnography for inspiration. [[Marcel Griaule]] and [[Michel Leiris]] are examples of people who combined anthropology with the French avant-garde. During this time most of what is known as ''ethnologie'' was restricted to museums, such as the [[Musée de l'Homme]] founded by [[Paul Rivet]], and anthropology had a close relationship with studies of [[folklore]].

==== Claude Lévi-Strauss ====
Above all, [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] helped institutionalize anthropology in France. Along with the enormous influence that his theory of [[structuralism]] exerted across multiple disciplines, Lévi-Strauss established ties with American and British anthropologists. At the same time, he established centers and laboratories within France to provide an institutional context within anthropology, while training influential students such as [[Maurice Godelier]] and [[Françoise Héritier]]. They proved influential in the world of French anthropology. Much of the distinct character of France's anthropology today is a result of the fact that most anthropology is carried out in nationally funded research laboratories ([[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]) rather than academic departments in universities

Other influential writers in the 1970s include [[Pierre Clastres]], who explains in his books on the [[Guayakis|Guayaki]] tribe in [[Paraguay]] that "primitive societies" actively oppose the institution of the [[state (polity)|state]]. These stateless societies are not less evolved than societies with states, but chose to conjure the institution of [[authority]] as a separate function from society. The [[Leadership|leader]] is only a spokesperson for the group when it has to deal with other groups ("international relations") but has no inside authority, and may be violently removed if he attempts to abuse this position.&lt;ref&gt;Bartholomew Dean "Critical Re-vision: Clastres' Chronicle and the optic of [[primitivism]]", 2002 In ''Best of Anthropology Today, 1974–2000'', ed. J. Benthall, with a preface by M. Sahlins. London: Routledge. [https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0415262550 Amazon.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important French social theorist since [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] and Lévi-Strauss is [[Pierre Bourdieu]], who trained formally in philosophy and sociology and eventually held the Chair of Sociology at the Collège de France. Like Mauss and others before him, he worked on topics both in sociology and anthropology. His fieldwork among the [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] of Algeria places him solidly in anthropology, while his analysis of the function and reproduction of fashion and cultural capital in European societies places him as solidly in sociology.

===United States===
From its beginnings in the early 19th century through the early 20th century, anthropology in the United States was influenced by the presence of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] societies. [[File:FranzBoas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Franz Boas]], one of the pioneers of modern anthropology, often called the "Father of American Anthropology"]]
[[Cultural anthropology]] in the United States was influenced greatly by the ready availability of Native American societies as ethnographic subjects. The field was pioneered by staff of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and the Smithsonian Institution's [[Bureau of American Ethnology]], men such as [[John Wesley Powell]] and [[Frank Hamilton Cushing]].

Late-eighteenth-century ethnology established the scientific foundation for the field, which began to mature in the United States during the presidency of [[Andrew Jackson]] (1829–1837). Jackson was responsible for implementing the Indian Removal Act, the coerced and forced removal of an estimated 100,000 American Indians during the 1830s to Indian Territory in present-day Oklahoma; for insuring that the franchise was extended to all white men, irrespective of financial means while denying virtually all black men the right to vote; and, for suppressing abolitionists' efforts to end slavery while vigorously defending that institution. Finally, he was responsible for appointing Chief Justice [[Roger B. Taney]] who would decide, in Scott v. Sandford (1857), that Negroes were "beings of an inferior order, and altogether unfit to associate with the white race&amp;nbsp;... and so far inferior that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect". As a result of this decision, black people, whether free or enslaved, could never become citizens of the United States.

It was in this context that the so-called American School of Anthropology thrived as the champion of polygenism or the doctrine of multiple origins—sparking a debate between those influenced by the Bible who believed in the unity of humanity and those who argued from a scientific standpoint for the plurality of origins and the antiquity of distinct types. Like the monogenists, these theories were not monolithic and often used words like races, species, hybrid, and mongrel interchangeably. A scientific consensus began to emerge during this period "that there exists a Genus Homo, embracing many primordial types of 'species'". [[Charles Caldwell (physician)|Charles Caldwell]], [[Samuel George Morton]], [[Samuel A. Cartwright]], [[George Gliddon]], [[Josiah C. Nott]], and [[Louis Agassiz]], and even South Carolina Governor [[James Henry Hammond]] were all influential proponents of this school. While some were disinterested scientists, others were passionate advocates who used science to promote slavery in a period of increasing sectional strife. All were complicit in establishing the putative science that justified slavery, informed the Dred Scott decision, underpinned miscegenation laws, and eventually fueled Jim Crow. Samuel G. Morton, for example, claimed to be just a scientist but he did not hesitate to provide evidence of Negro inferiority to John C. Calhoun, the prominent pro-slavery Secretary of State to help him negotiate the annexation of Texas as a slave state.

The high-water mark of polygenic theories was Josiah Nott and Gliddon's voluminous eight-hundred page tome titled ''Types of Mankind'', published in 1854. Reproducing the work of Louis Agassiz and Samuel Morton, the authors spread the virulent and explicitly racist views to a wider, more popular audience. The first printing sold out quickly and by the end of the century it had undergone nine editions. Although many Southerners felt that all the justification for slavery they needed was found in the Bible, others used the new science to defend slavery and the repression of American Indians. Abolitionists, however, felt they had to take this science on its own terms. And for the first time, African American intellectuals waded into the contentious debate. In the immediate wake of Types of Mankind and during the pitched political battles that led to Civil War, [[Frederick Douglass]] (1818–1895), the statesman and persuasive abolitionist, directly attacked the leading theorists of the American School of Anthropology. In an 1854 address, entitled "The Claims of the Negro Ethnologically Considered", Douglass argued that "by making the enslaved a character fit only for slavery, [slaveowners] excuse themselves for refusing to make the slave a freeman.... For let it be once granted that the human race are of multitudinous origin, naturally different in their moral, physical, and intellectual capacities&amp;nbsp;... a chance is left for slavery, as a necessary institution.... There is no doubt that Messrs. Nott, Glidden, Morton, Smith and Agassiz were duly consulted by our slavery propagating statesmen" (p.&amp;nbsp;287).

==== Lewis Henry Morgan in the United States====
[[Lewis Henry Morgan]] (1818–1881), a lawyer from [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]], became an advocate for and ethnological scholar of the [[Iroquois]]. His comparative analyses of religion, government, material culture, and especially kinship patterns proved to be influential contributions to the field of anthropology. Like other scholars of his day (such as [[Edward Tylor]]), Morgan argued that human societies could be classified into categories of cultural evolution on a scale of progression that ranged from ''savagery'', to ''barbarism'', to ''civilization''. He focused on understanding how cultures integrated and systematized, and how the various features of one culture indicate an evolutionary status in comparison with other cultures. Generally, Morgan used technology (such as bowmaking or pottery) as an indicator of position on this scale.

==== Franz Boas ====
[[Franz Boas]] established academic anthropology in the United States in opposition to this sort of evolutionary perspective. His approach was empirical, skeptical of overgeneralizations, and eschewed attempts to establish universal laws. For example, Boas studied immigrant children to demonstrate that biological race was not immutable, and that human conduct and behavior resulted from nurture, rather than nature.

Influenced by the German tradition, Boas argued that the world was full of distinct ''cultures,'' rather than societies whose evolution could be measured by how much or how little "civilization" they had. He believed that each culture has to be studied in its particularity, and argued that cross-cultural generalizations, like those made in the [[natural science]]s, were not possible.

In doing so, he fought discrimination against immigrants, blacks, and indigenous peoples of the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. (1968) ''Race, Culture, and Evolution: Essays in the history of anthropology''. London: The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many American anthropologists adopted his agenda for social reform, and theories of race continue to be popular subjects for anthropologists today. The so-called "Four Field Approach" has its origins in Boasian Anthropology, dividing the discipline in the four crucial and interrelated fields of sociocultural, biological, linguistic, and archaic anthropology (e.g. archaeology). Anthropology in the United States continues to be deeply influenced by the Boasian tradition, especially its emphasis on culture.
[[File:Ruth Benedict.jpg|thumb|[[Ruth Benedict]] in 1937]]

Boas used his positions at [[Columbia University]] and the [[American Museum of Natural History]] to train and develop multiple generations of students. His first generation of students included [[Alfred Kroeber]], [[Robert Lowie]], [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Ruth Benedict]], who each produced richly detailed studies of indigenous North American cultures. They provided a wealth of details used to attack the theory of a single evolutionary process. Kroeber and Sapir's focus on Native American languages helped establish [[linguistics]] as a truly general science and free it from its historical focus on [[Indo-European languages]].

The publication of [[Alfred Kroeber]]'s textbook, ''Anthropology,'' marked a turning point in American anthropology. After three decades of amassing material, Boasians felt a growing urge to generalize. This was most obvious in the 'Culture and Personality' studies carried out by younger Boasians such as [[Margaret Mead]] and [[Ruth Benedict]]. Influenced by psychoanalytic psychologists including [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Carl Jung]], these authors sought to understand the way that individual personalities were shaped by the wider cultural and social forces in which they grew up.

Though such works as ''[[Coming of Age in Samoa]]'' and ''[[The Chrysanthemum and the Sword]]'' remain popular with the American public, Mead and Benedict never had the impact on the discipline of anthropology that some expected. Boas had planned for Ruth Benedict to succeed him as chair of Columbia's anthropology department, but she was sidelined by [[Ralph Linton]], and Mead was limited to her offices at the [[American Museum of Natural History|AMNH]].

===Other countries===
Anthropology as it emerged amongst the Western colonial powers (mentioned above) has generally taken a different path than that in the countries of southern and central Europe ([[Italy]], [[Greece]], and the successors to the [[Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Ottoman empire]]s). In the former, the encounter with multiple, distinct cultures, often very different in organization and language from those of Europe, has led to a continuing emphasis on [[cross-cultural comparison]] and a receptiveness to certain kinds of cultural relativism.&lt;ref name="Spiro1987"&gt;On varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology, see Spiro, Melford E. (1987) "Some Reflections on Cultural Determinism and Relativism with Special Reference to Emotion and Reason", in ''Culture and Human Nature: theoretical papers of Melford E. Spiro''. Edited by B. Kilborne and L. L. Langness, pp. 32–58. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the successor states of continental Europe, on the other hand, anthropologists often joined with folklorists and linguists in building cultural perspectives on nationalism. Ethnologists in these countries tended to focus on differentiating among local ethnolinguistic groups, documenting local folk culture, and representing the prehistory of what has become a nation through various forms of public education (e.g., museums of several kinds).&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest. (1998) ''Language and solitude: Wittgenstein, Malinowski, and the Habsburg dilemma''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this scheme, Russia occupied a middle position. On the one hand, it had a large region (largely east of the Urals) of highly distinct, pre-industrial, often non-literate peoples, similar to the situation in the Americas. On the other hand, Russia also participated to some degree in the nationalist (cultural and political) movements of Central and Eastern Europe. After the Revolution of 1917, views expressed by anthropologists in the USSR, and later the Soviet Bloc countries, were highly shaped by the requirement to conform to Marxist theories of social evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Gellner, Ernest, ed. (1980) ''Soviet and Western anthropology''. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Greece, there was since the 19th century a science of the [[folklore]] called ''laographia'' (laography), in the form of "a science of the interior", although theoretically weak; but the connotation of the field deeply changed after World War II, when a wave of Anglo-American anthropologists introduced a science "of the outside".&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Zoïa, "L'anthropologie en Grèce", Terrain, Numéro 14—L'incroyable et ses preuves (mars 1990), [En ligne], mis en ligne le 7 octobre 2005, [http://terrain.revues.org/document3641.html Terrain.revues.org], Consulté le 15 juin 2007. {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Italy, the development of [[ethnology]] and related studies did not receive as much attention as other branches of learning&lt;ref&gt;Grottanelli, Vinigi ''Ethnology and/or Cultural Anthropology in Italy: Traditions and Developments (and Comments and Reply)''. Other authors: Giorgio Ausenda, Bernardo Bernardi, Ugo Bianchi, [[Y. Michal Bodemann]], Jack Goody, Allison Jablonko, David I. Kertzer, Vittorio Lanternari, Antonio Marazzi, Roy A.

''[[Current Anthropology]]'', Vol. 18, No. 4 (December, 1977), pp. 593–614 {{jstor|2741501}}&lt;/ref&gt;, but nonetheless included important researchers and thinkers like [[Ernesto De Martino]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bookrags.com/research/de-martino-ernesto-eorl-04/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Germany]] and [[Norway]] are the countries that showed the most division and conflict between scholars focusing on domestic socio-cultural issues and scholars focusing on "other" societies.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}.

The development of [[World Anthropologies|world anthropologies]] has followed different trajectories.

==20th-century developments==
In the mid-20th century, American anthropology began to study its own history more systematically. In 1967 [[Marvin Harris]] published his ''The Rise of Anthropological Theory'', presenting argumentative examinations of anthropology's historical developments, and [[George W. Stocking, Jr.]], established the historicist school, examining the historical contexts of anthropological movements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16553">The '''immortal DNA strand hypothesis''' was proposed in 1975 by [[John Cairns (biochemist)|John Cairns]] as a mechanism for [[adult stem cells]] to minimize [[mutations]] in their [[genomes]].&lt;ref name="Cairns"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/255197a0| pmid=1143315|title = Mutation selection and the natural history of cancer| journal=Nature| volume=255| issue=5505| pages=197–200|year = 1975|last1 = Cairns|first1 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis proposes that instead of segregating their [[DNA]] during [[mitosis]] in a random manner, adult stem cells divide their DNA asymmetrically, and retain a distinct template set of DNA strands (parental strands) in each division. By retaining the same set of template DNA strands, adult stem cells would pass mutations arising from errors in [[DNA replication]] on to non-stem cell daughters that soon terminally [[Cellular differentiation|differentiate]] (end mitotic divisions and become a functional cell). Passing on these replication errors would allow adult stem cells to reduce their rate of accumulation of mutations that could lead to serious [[genetic disorder]]s such as [[cancer]].

Although evidence for this mechanism exists, whether it is a mechanism acting in adult stem cells [[in vivo]] is still controversial.

==Methods==
Two main [[assay]]s are used to detect immortal DNA strand segregation: label-retention and label-release pulse/chase assays.

In the label-retention assay, the goal is to mark 'immortal' or parental DNA strands with a DNA label such as tritiated [[thymidine]] or [[bromodeoxyuridine]] (BrdU). These types of DNA labels will incorporate into the newly synthesized DNA of dividing cells during [[S phase]].  A pulse of DNA label is given to adult stem cells under conditions where they have not yet delineated an immortal DNA strand.  During these conditions, the adult stem cells are either dividing ''symmetrically'' (thus with each division a new 'immortal' strand is determined and in at least one of the stem cells the immortal DNA strand will be marked with DNA label), or the adult stem cells have ''not yet been determined'' (thus their precursors are dividing symmetrically, and once they differentiate into adult stem cells and choose an 'immortal' strand, the 'immortal strand' will already have been marked). Experimentally, adult stem cells are undergoing symmetric divisions during growth and after wound healing, and are not yet determined at neonatal stages. Once the immortal DNA strand is labelled and the adult stem cell has begun or resumed asymmetric divisions, the DNA label is chased out. In symmetric divisions (most [[mitotic]] cells), DNA is segregating randomly and the DNA label will be diluted out to levels below detection after five divisions.  If, however, cells are using an immortal DNA strand mechanism, then all the labeled DNA will continue to co-segregate with the adult stem cell, and after five (or more) divisions will still be detected within the adult stem cell. These cells are sometimes called label-retaining cells (LRCs).

In the label-release assay, the goal is to mark the newly synthesized DNA that is normally passed on to the daughter (non-stem) cell.  A pulse of DNA label is given to adult stem cells under conditions where they are dividing ''asymmetrically.'' Under conditions of [[homeostasis]], adult stem cells should be dividing asymmetrically so that the same number of adult stem cells is maintained in the tissue compartment.  After pulsing for long enough to label all the newly replicated DNA, the DNA label is chased out (each DNA replication now incorporates unlabeled nucleotides) and the adult stem cells are assayed for loss of the DNA label after two cell divisions. If cells are using a random segregation mechanism, then enough DNA label should remain in the cell to be detected. If, however, the adult stem cells are using an immortal DNA strand mechanism, they are obligated to retain the unlabeled 'immortal' DNA, and will release all the newly synthesized labeled DNA to their differentiating daughter cells in two divisions.

Some scientists have combined the two approaches,&lt;ref name="Potten"&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid = 12006622|year = 2002|last1 = Potten|first1 = C. S.|title = Intestinal stem cells protect their genome by selective segregation of template DNA strands|journal = Journal of Cell Science|volume = 115|issue = Pt 11|pages = 2381–8|last2 = Owen|first2 = G.|last3 = Booth|first3 = D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1242/dev.01609| pmid=15647322|title = Label-retaining epithelial cells in mouse mammary gland divide asymmetrically and retain their template DNA strands| journal=Development| volume=132| issue=4| pages=681–687|year = 2005|last1 = Smith|first1 = G. H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; by first using one DNA label to label the immortal strands, allowing to adult stem cells to begin dividing asymmetrically, and then using a different DNA label to label the newly synthesized DNA.  Thus, the adult stem cells will retain one DNA label and release the other within two divisions.

==Evidence==
Evidence for the immortal DNA strand hypothesis has been found in various systems.  One of the earliest studies by Karl Lark ''et al.'' demonstrated co-segregation of DNA in the cells of plant root tips.&lt;ref name="Lark"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1073/pnas.58.1.352|title = Nonrandom segregation of sister chromatids in Vicia faba and Triticum boeoticum| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume=58| pages=352–359|year = 1967|last1 = Lark|first1 = K. G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant root tips labeled with tritiated thymidine tended to segregate their labeled DNA to the same daughter cell.  Though not all the labeled DNA segregated to the same daughter, the amount of thymidine-labeled DNA seen in the daughter with less label corresponded to the amount that would have arisen from sister-chromatid exchange.&lt;ref name="Lark" /&gt; Later studies by Christopher Potten ''et al.'' (2002),&lt;ref name="Potten" /&gt; using pulse/chase experiments with tritiated thymidine, found long-term label-retaining cells in the small intestinal crypts of neonatal mice. These researchers hypothesized that long-term incorporation of tritiated thymidine occurred because neonatal mice have undeveloped small intestines, and that pulsing tritiated thymidine soon after the birth of the mice allowed the 'immortal' DNA of adult stem cells to be labeled during their formation.  These long-term cells were demonstrated to be actively cycling, as demonstrated by incorporation and release of BrdU.&lt;ref name="Potten" /&gt;

Since these cells were cycling but continued to contain the BrdU label in their DNA, the researchers reasoned that they must be segregating their DNA using an immortal DNA strand mechanism. Joshua Merok ''et al.'' from the lab of James Sherley engineered mammalian cells with an inducible [[p53]] gene that controls asymmetric divisions.&lt;ref name="Merok"&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/cgi/content/full/62/23/6791 | title=Cosegregation of Chromosomes Containing Immortal DNA Strands in Cells That Cycle with Asymmetric Stem Cell Kinetics| journal=Cancer Research| volume=62| issue=23| pages=6791–6795| date=December 2002| last1=Sherley| first1=James L.| last2=Tunstead| first2=James R.| last3=Lansita| first3=Janice A.| last4=Merok| first4=Joshua R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; BrdU pulse/chase experiments with these cells demonstrated that chromosomes segregated non-randomly only when the cells were induced to divide asymmetrically like adult stem cells.  These asymmetrically dividing cells provide an ''in vitro'' model for demonstration and investigation of immortal strand mechanisms.  

Scientists have strived to demonstrate that this immortal DNA strand mechanism exists ''in vivo'' in other types of adult stem cells.  In 1996 Nik Zeps published the first paper demonstrating label retaining cells were present in the mouse mammary gland&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zeps|first=N.|last2=Dawkins|first2=H. J.|last3=Papadimitriou|first3=J. M.|last4=Redmond|first4=S. L.|last5=Walters|first5=M. I.|date=December 1996|title=Detection of a population of long-lived cells in mammary epithelium of the mouse|journal=Cell and Tissue Research|volume=286|issue=3|pages=525–536|issn=0302-766X|pmid=8929355}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this was confirmed in 2005 by Gilbert Smith who also published evidence that a subset of mouse mammary epithelial cells could retain DNA label and release DNA label in a manner consistent with the immortal DNA strand mechanism.&lt;ref name="Smith" /&gt; Soon after, scientists from the laboratory of Derek van der Kooy showed that mice have neural stem cells that are BrdU-retaining and continue to be mitotically active.&lt;ref name="Kooy"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1083/jcb.200502073| pmid=16115957| pmc=2171352|title = Support for the immortal strand hypothesis: Neural stem cells partition DNA asymmetrically in vitro| journal=The Journal of Cell Biology| volume=170| issue=5| pages=721–732|year = 2005|last1 = Karpowicz|first1 = Phillip| last2=Morshead| first2=Cindi| last3=Kam| first3=Angela| last4=Jervis| first4=Eric| last5=Ramunas| first5=John| last6=Cheng| first6=Vincent| last7=Van Der Kooy| first7=Derek}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Asymmetric segregation of DNA was shown using real-time imaging of cells in culture. In 2006, scientists in the lab of Shahragim Tajbakhsh presented evidence that muscle [[satellite cells]], which are proposed to be [[adult stem cells]] of the [[skeletal muscle]] compartment, exhibited asymmetric segregation of BrdU-labelled DNA when put into culture.  They also had evidence that demonstrated BrdU release kinetics consistent with an immortal DNA strand mechanism were operating ''in vivo'', using juvenile mice and mice with muscle regeneration induced by freezing.&lt;ref name="Shinin"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/ncb1425| pmid=16799552|title = Asymmetric division and cosegregation of template DNA strands in adult muscle satellite cells| journal=Nature Cell Biology| volume=8| issue=7| pages=677–682|year = 2006|last1 = Shinin|first1 = Vasily| last2=Gayraud-Morel| first2=Barbara| last3=Gomès| first3=Danielle| last4=Tajbakhsh| first4=Shahragim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These experiments supporting the immortal strand hypothesis, however, are not conclusive. While the Lark experiments demonstrated co-segregation, the co-segregation may have been an artifact of radiation from the tritium.  Although Potten identified the cycling, label-retaining cells as adult stem cells, these cells are difficult to identify unequivocally as adult stem cells. While the engineered cells provide an elegant model for co-segregation of chromosomes, studies with these cells were done ''in vitro'' with engineered cells. Some features may not be present ''in vivo'' or may be absent ''in vitro''. In May 2007 evidence in support of the Immortal DNA Strand theory was discovered by Michael Conboy et al.,&lt;ref name="Conboy"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050102| pmid=17439301| pmc=1852584|title = High Incidence of Non-Random Template Strand Segregation and Asymmetric Fate Determination in Dividing Stem Cells and their Progeny| journal=PLOS Biology| volume=5| issue=5| pages=e102|year = 2007|last1 = Conboy|first1 = Michael J.| last2=Karasov| first2=Ariela O.| last3=Rando| first3=Thomas A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the muscle stem/satellite cell model during tissue regeneration, where there is tremendous cell division during a relatively brief period of time.  Using two BrdU analogs to label template and newly synthesized DNA strands, they saw that about half of the dividing cells in regenerating muscle sort the older "Immortal" DNA to one daughter cell and the younger DNA to the other.  In keeping with the stem cell hypothesis, the more undifferentiated daughter typically inherited the chromatids with the older DNA, while the more differentiated daughter inherited the younger DNA.

Experimental evidence against the immortal strand hypothesis is sparse.  In one study, researchers incorporated tritiated thymidine into dividing murine epidermal basal cells.&lt;ref name="Kuroki"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1111/j.1349-7006.1989.tb01690.x|title = Random Segregation of DNA Strands in Epidermal Basal Cells| journal=Japanese Journal of Cancer Research| volume=80| issue=7| pages=637–642|year = 1989|last1 = Kuroki|first1 = Toshio| last2=Murakami| first2=Yoshinori}}&lt;/ref&gt; They followed the release of tritiated thymidine after various chase periods, but the pattern of release was not consistent with the immortal strand hypothesis.  Although they found label-retaining cells, they were not within the putative stem cell compartment.  With increasing lengths of time for the chase periods, these label-retaining cells were located farther from the putative stem cell compartment, suggesting that the label-retaining cells had moved.  However, finding conclusive evidence against the immortal strand hypothesis has proven difficult.

After Cairns first proposed the immortal DNA strand mechanism, the theory has undergone several refinements.

In 2002, he proposed that in addition to using immortal DNA strand mechanisms to segregate DNA, when the immortal DNA strands of adult stem cells undergo damage, they will choose to die (apoptose) rather than use DNA repair mechanisms that are normally used in non-stem cells.&lt;ref name="Cairns2"&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.pnas.org/cgi/content/full/99/16/10567 | doi=10.1073/pnas.162369899| pmid=12149477| pmc=124976| title=Somatic stem cells and the kinetics of mutagenesis and carcinogenesis| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume=99| issue=16| pages=10567–10570| year=2002| last1=Cairns| first1=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
[[Emmanuel David Tannenbaum]] and James Sherley developed a quantitative model describing how repair of [[point mutation]]s might differ in adult stem cells.&lt;ref name="Tannenbaum"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1103/physreve.71.041914| pmid=15903708|title = Evolutionary dynamics of adult stem cells: Comparison of random and immortal-strand segregation mechanisms| journal=Physical Review E| volume=71| issue=4| pages=041914|year = 2005|last1 = Tannenbaum|first1 = Emmanuel| last2=Sherley| first2=James L.| last3=Shakhnovich| first3=Eugene I.| arxiv=q-bio/0411048}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found that in adult stem cells, repair was most efficient if they used an immortal DNA strand mechanism for segregating DNA, rather than a random segregation mechanism.  This method would be beneficial because it avoids wrongly fixing DNA mutations in both DNA strands and propagating the mutation.

==Mechanisms==
The complete proof of a concept generally requires a plausible mechanism that could mediate the effect.  Although controversial, there is a suggestion that this could be provided by the Dynein Motor.&lt;ref name="Klar1"&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/315/5808/100 | doi=10.1126/science.1129429| pmid=17204651| title=Left-Right Dynein Motor Implicated in Selective Chromatid Segregation in Mouse Cells| journal=Science| volume=315| issue=5808| pages=100–101| year=2007| last1=Armakolas| first1=A.| last2=Klar| first2=A.

However, this work has highly respected biologists among its detractors as exemplified by a further comment on a paper by the same authors from 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/313/5790/1045b | doi=10.1126/science.1127836| pmid=16931739| title=Comment on "Cell Type Regulates Selective Segregation of Mouse Chromosome 7 DNA Strands in Mitosis"| journal=Science| volume=313| issue=5790| pages=1045b| year=2006| last1=Haber| first1=J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19546">The''' Institute for Economics &amp; Peace''' ('''IEP'''), is a global [[think tank]] headquartered in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] with branches in [[New York City]], [[Mexico City]] and [[The Hague]]. The IEP is  chaired by technology entrepreneur  [[Steve Killelea]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uncnews.unc.edu/2015/10/01/founder-and-executive-chair-of-the-institute-for-economics-and-peace-steve-killelea-speaks-about-the-global-peace-index-oct-2/|title=Founder and executive chair of the Institute for Economics and Peace Steve Killelea speaks about the Global Peace Index, Oct. 2|last=VanGraafeil|first=Mc|date=2015-10-01|website=UNC News|access-date=2017-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; founder of Integrated Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ir.com/team/steve-killelea|title=Steve Killelea|last=IR.com|website=www.ir.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
IEP is dedicated to shifting the world's focus to peace as a positive, achievable, and tangible measure of human well-being and progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jubitz.org/peace|title=Peacebuilding|website=jubitz.org|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It achieves its goals by developing global and national peace indices, calculating the ''economic cost of violence'', analysing country level risk and understanding the conditions which underpin highly peaceful societies - ''Positive Peace''.

IEP produce frameworks to define peacefulness, providing metrics for measurement, uncovering the relationship between peace, business, and prosperity, and by promoting a better understanding of the cultural, economic, and political factors that drive peacefulness.

=== Partners ===
IEP works in partnership with a number of think tanks, NGOs and academic institutions including the [[Aspen Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Aspen Institute Business and Society Program| url = http://www.aspeninstitute.org/policy-work/business-society| accessdate =2010-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.csis.org/events/global-peace-index-2017-launch|title=The Global Peace Index 2017 Launch|website=csis.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Peace Institute]], [[Open Society Foundations]], and [[King's College London]]. It also collaborates with intergovernmental organizations such as the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/crisis-prevention-and-recovery/development-of-goal-and-purpose-indicators-for-undp.html|title=Development of Goal and Purpose Indicators for UNDP|website=undo.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNICEF]], [[NATO]], the [[World Bank Group]], and [[UN Peacebuilding Support Office]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/en/peacebuilding/pbso&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2015, IEP has been an active member of the [[United Nations Global Compact|UN Global Compact]] Expert Group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/participants/66591-Institute-for-Economics-and-Peace-|title=Institute for Economics and Peace  {{!}} UN Global Compact|website=www.unglobalcompact.org|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Responsible Business and Investment in High-Risk Areas.

IEP has a strategic partnership with [[Rotary International]] and [[One Young World]], which involves training of Global Peace Index Ambassadors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://my.rotary.org/en/news-media/rotary-peace-fellows-win-competition-spread-peace|title=Rotary Peace Fellows win competition to spread peace {{!}} My Rotary|website=my.rotary.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the program focuses on engaging young leaders in understanding IEP’s empirical peace research.

IEP is also a member of the [[Sustainable Development Goals|Sustainable Development Goal]] 16 Data Initiative, which is a consortium that compiles existing global data to assist in tracking progress towards achieving Goal 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prio.org/Events/Event/?x=8438|title=Measuring Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies: Launch of the SDG16 Data Initiative|last=(PRIO)|first=Peace Pesearch Institute Oslo|website=www.prio.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global Peace Index ==
The core asset of the IEP is the [[Global Peace Index]] (GPI), which is now considered the benchmark study in measuring peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-40118188|title=Global Peace Index 2017: World 0.28% more peaceful than last year|last=|first=|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ids.ac.uk/events/measuring-and-understanding-peace|title=Measuring and Understanding Peace|last=|first=|date=|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPI has been recognized by leading analysts and institutions, and has been incorporated into reports such as the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]]'s Year Book (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Appendix 2B.

The data for the GPI is collected and collated in collaboration with the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] (EIU),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Detailed information can be found from | url= http://www.eiu.com/site_info.asp?info_name=corporate_landing_united_nations&amp;rf=0| accessdate =2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the research and analysis arm of the [[Economist Group]], and the methodology is informed and reviewed each year by an international panel of peace and statistics experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Peaceful Nations|publisher= Alliance for Peacebuilding |url= http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/documents/GSPNPeacefulNationsReportFinal_001.pdf| accessdate =2010-04-13}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPI is released annually with presentations typically held in [[London]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Geneva]], [[Paris]], [[New York City]], [[Sydney]], [[Brussels]] and [[The Hague]].

The GPI is used by various international organizations, such as the [[United Nations|UN]] and [[World bank|World Bank]] as a source of data and information as well as being used by academics and universities around the world.

In addition, the GPI was the empirical basis for the Symposium of Peaceful Nations, a 3-day conference hosted in November 2009 to honor the most peaceful countries in each of nine regions of the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/documents/GSPNPeacefulNationsReportFinal_001.pdf|title=Symposium of Peaceful Nations|accessdate=2010-04-13}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; at which [[Helen Clark]], UNDP Administrator, delivered the keynote address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.undp.org/go/newsroom/2009/november/helen-clark-statement-at-the-global-symposium-of-peaceful-nations.en|title=Helen Clark: Statement at the Global Symposium of Peaceful Nations|accessdate=2010-04-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228165855/http://content.undp.org/go/newsroom/2009/november/helen-clark-statement-at-the-global-symposium-of-peaceful-nations.en|archivedate=2010-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute for Economics &amp; Peace, in 2016, marked 10 years of measuring and analysing global levels of peace. In celebration of this milestone, IEP along with the Diplomatic Courier Magazine hosted the Future of Peace Summit in Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/event/2016/06/future-of-peace-summit/|title=Future of Peace Summit|work=Alliance for Peacebuilding|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th annual GPI launched in June 2017 includes 163 countries in the world, and the interactive map on [http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/global-peace-index/ the website] explains the rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/global-peace-index-us-middle-east-relations-donald-trump-syria-politics-iran-a7766561.html|title=Last year there were 10 countries in the world entirely free from war.

The 2017 GPI recorded a small improvement in average global peace, with 93 countries recording higher levels of peace and 68 recording a deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australian_outlook/global-peace-17/|title=The Status of World Peace May Surprise You|work=Australian Institute of International Affairs|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Peace Indices==
IEP has also launched a series of National Peace Indices. The first one was the United States Peace Index ([[United States Peace Index|USPI]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/us-peace-index/|title=US Peace Index – Vision of Humanity|last=Humanity|first=Vision of|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2011. The USPI ranks each state in the US by peacefulness and, unlike the [[Global Peace Index|GPI]], uses only 5 indicators: incarceration rate, the number of police officers, the number of homicides, the availability of small arms, and the number of violent crimes. In 2011 Maine was ranked the most peaceful state, while Louisiana was the least peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#/page/our-uspi-findings&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/03/UK-Peace-Index-report-2013.pdf UK Peace Index] was conducted in 2013. The UK Peace Index provides a comprehensive measure of the levels of peacefulness within the United Kingdom from 2003 to 2012.

The [[Mexico Peace Index]] ([[Mexico Peace Index|MPI]]) is the latest in the series of National Peace Indices. There have been 4 editions of the MPI to date, the first published in 2013, and most recently 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/mexico-peace-index/|title=Mexico Peace Index – Vision of Humanity|last=Humanity|first=Vision of|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MPI uses five indicators to gauge the level of peace in the 32 Mexican states from 2003-2016. The indicators are: ''Homicide rates, violent crime, detention without a sentence, weapons crime'' and ''organised crime''.

An expert panel is engaged to provide independent advice and technical guidance in developing the methodology, these experts are from independent, non-partisan, civil society and academic organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/mexico-peace-index/|title=Mexico Peace Index – Vision of Humanity|last=Humanity|first=Vision of|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 MPI found that peacefulness deteriorated by 4.3% in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mexicoinstitute.wordpress.com/2017/04/05/institute-for-economics-and-peace-releases-2017-mexico-peace-index/|title=Institute for Economics and Peace releases 2017 Mexico Peace Index|last=mexicoinstitute|date=2017-04-05|website=Mexico Institute|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the homicide rate rose by 18.4% in the same year. Yucatán is the most peaceful state in Mexico, while Guerrero is the least peaceful state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/peace-index-registers-first-decline-in-5-years/|title=Mexico Peace Index registers first decline in 5 years|date=2017-04-05|work=Mexico News Daily|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data used to calculate the MPI comes from government bodies in Mexico, and IEP uses survey data collection by the national statistical office to adjust the figures for under reporting.

==Global Terrorism Index==
Another flagship report of the IEP is the [[Global Terrorism Index]] ([[Global Terrorism Index|GTI]]) which provides a comprehensive summary of the key global trends and patterns in terrorism. The report analyses data spanning the past 16 years and four editions having been released to date.

The GTI is based on data from the [[Global Terrorism Database|Global Terrorism Database (GTD)]]. It ranks 163 countries based on four indicators, those indicators are; ''number of terrorist incidents in a given year, number of fatalities from terrorist incidents in a given year, number of injuries caused by terrorist in a given year'' and ''measure of the total property damage from terrorist incidents in a given year.''

The 2016 GTI report found a ten per cent decrease in the number of deaths from terrorism in 2015 resulted in 3,389 fewer deaths than 2014, a global total of 29,376 deaths made 2015 the second deadliest year on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/world/global-terrorism-report/index.html|title=Terror attacks in developed world surge 650% in one year|last=CNN|first=Kara Fox and Dave Gilbert|website=CNN|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Economic Value of Peace ==
The [http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/02/The-Economic-Value-of-Peace-2016-WEB.pdf Economic Value of Peace report] estimates of the economic impact of violence and conflict on the global economy.

It provides an empirical basis to calculate the potential additional economic benefits from improvements in peace. It estimates the economic impact of violence for 163 countries and independent territories representing 99.5 per cent of the global economy and population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/how-much-does-violence-really-cost-our-global-economy/|title=How much does violence really cost our global economy?|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global economic impact of violence was $14.3 trillion [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]] in 2016, equivalent to 12.6% of global GDP, or $1,953 per person, this figure represented the first decline in the economic impact of violence since 2011, which is the year that corresponded with the start of the Syrian war and ISIL's territorial gains in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-peace-index-idUSKBN0OX0AU20150617|title=Cost of violence hits $14 trillion in increasingly divided world|date=2015-06-17|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global Peace Report==
On October 26, 2010, IEP and Peace and Media Tenor released “Measuring Peace in the Media”, the first study that takes a fact-based approach into understanding the accuracy of international television networks’ coverage of peace, violence and conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.visionofhumanity.org/info-center/measuring-peace-in-the-media/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107121303/http://www.visionofhumanity.org/info-center/measuring-peace-in-the-media/# |archive-date=2011-01-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results show broad inconsistencies across geographies and networks, with US broadcasters much more focused on violence and conflict than their European and Middle Eastern counterparts. Al Jazeera was found to be the network providing the most balanced coverage on Afghanistan. BBC World led the way when it came to breadth of coverage. It regularly reported on 67 countries across six continents which is nearly twice as many countries as the average level of coverage.

The study analysed 37 TV news and current affairs programmes from 23 networks in 15 countries* and then cross-referenced this with the Global Peace Index which measures the levels of peace and violence in 149 countries. BBC 2 Newsnight and ZDF Heute Journal (Germany) were found to be the programmes whose editorial policies aligned their coverage most closely with the rankings of the GPI.

Positive-peace stories make up just 1.6% of the total number of stories examined in the study. These are stories that report on active steps taken to rectify violent situations. Such a small percentage may be partly related to what is considered newsworthy and dramatic, such as high-impact, violent or controversial events. However, the stereotyping of nations which are low on the GPI makes it harder for audiences to gain empathy and therefore to support governments and make headway towards creating peace.

== Positive Peace ==
Positive Peace is an innovative and empirically based framework which has been developed by IEP to identify and understand the factors which are statistically associated with peaceful and resilient societies. Positive Peace is measured by IEP on the [http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/02/Positive-Peace-Report-2016.pdf Positive Peace Index (PPI)].

While the Global Peace Index measures 'Negative Peace' being the absence of violence or fear of violence, Positive Peace represents the capacity for a society to meet the needs of its citizens, reduce and deal with grievances without the use of violence.

The framework is based on the quantitatively identifiable common characteristics of the world's most peaceful societies.

The defining feature of IEP’s Positive Peace framework is the [[systems approach]] to peace. IEP research has demonstrated that high levels of peacefulness are associated with strength in not just one, but all eight factors of Positive Peace. All domains are highly interrelated and work together systemically in producing a peaceful society.

== Reception ==
The [http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&amp;context=think_tanks Global Go To Think Tank Index] listed the Institute for Economics and Peace as a "Think Tank to Watch", and as one of the top 20 most impactful Think Tanks worldwide with a Budget under $5 Million.

In 2013, Steve Killelea’s founding of IEP was recognized as one of the 50 most impactful philanthropic gifts in Australia’s history by a coalition including the Myer Family Company, [[Myer Foundation|The Myer Foundation]] and Sidney Myer Fund, Pro Bono Australia, [[Swinburne University]] and Philanthropy Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.probonoaustralia.com.au/news/2013/10/australia%E2%80%99s-top-50-philanthropic-gifts-all-time#sthash.HlK828IS.dpuf|title=Australia’s Top 50 Philanthropic Gifts of All Time|date=2013-10-14|publisher=ProBono Australia|accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4611">'''Knowledge acquisition''' is the process used to define the rules and ontologies required for a [[knowledge-based system]]. The phrase was first used in conjunction with [[expert systems]] to describe the initial tasks associated with developing an expert system, namely finding and interviewing [[knowledge domain|domain]] experts and capturing their knowledge via [[Rule-based system|rules]], [[Object-oriented programming|objects]], and [[Frame language|frame-based]] [[Ontologies (computer science)|ontologies]]. 

Expert systems were one of the first successful applications of [[artificial intelligence]] technology to real world business problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Stuart|last2=Norvig|first2=Peter|title=Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach|date=1995|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=0-13-103805-2|pages=22–23|url=http://stpk.cs.rtu.lv/sites/all/files/stpk/materiali/MI/Artificial%20Intelligence%20A%20Modern%20Approach.pdf|accessdate=14 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at [[Stanford university|Stanford]] and other AI laboratories worked with doctors and other highly skilled experts to develop systems that could automate complex tasks such as [[medical diagnosis]]. Until this point computers had mostly been used to automate highly data intensive tasks but not for complex reasoning. Technologies such as [[Inference engine|inference engines]] allowed developers for the first time to tackle more complex problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

As expert systems scaled up from demonstration prototypes to industrial strength applications it was soon realized that the acquisition of domain expert knowledge was one of if not the most critical task in the [[knowledge engineering]] process. This knowledge acquisition process became an intense area of research on its own. One of the earlier works&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

One approach to knowledge acquisition investigated was to use [[natural language parsing]] and generation to facilitate knowledge acquisition. Natural language parsing could be performed on manuals and other expert documents and an initial first pass at the rules and objects could be developed automatically. Text generation was also extremely useful in generating explanations for system behavior. This greatly facilitated the development and maintenance of expert systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Potter|first1=Steven|title=A Survey of Knowledge Acquisition from Natural Language|journal=Technology Maturity Assessment (TMA)|url=http://www.aiai.ed.ac.uk/project/akt/work/stephenp/TMA%20of%20KAfromNL.pdf|accessdate=9 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent approach to knowledge acquisition is a re-use based approach. Knowledge can be developed in [[Ontology_(information_science)|ontologies]] that conform to standards such as the [[Web_Ontology_Language|Web Ontology Language (OWL)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schreiber|first1=Guus|title=Knowledge acquisition and the web|journal=International Journal of Human-Computer Studies|date=25 September 2012|issue=71|pages=206–210|url=http://www.cs.vu.nl/~guus/papers/Schreiber13a.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2017|publisher=Elsevior}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way knowledge can be standardized and shared across a broad community of knowledge workers. One example domain where this approach has been successful is [[bioinformatics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goble|first1=Carole|title=State of the nation in data integration for bioinformatics|journal=Journal of Biomedical Informatics|date=2008|volume=41|issue=5|pages=687693|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1532046408000178|accessdate=5 March 2017|doi=10.1016/j.jbi.2008.01.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Light poetry''' or '''light verse''' is [[poetry]] that attempts to be humorous.  Light poems are usually brief, can be on a frivolous or serious subject, and often feature [[word play]] including [[pun]]s, adventurous rhyme, and heavy [[alliteration]]. Typically, light verse in English is formal verse, although a few [[free verse]] poets have excelled at light verse outside the formal verse tradition.

While light poetry is sometimes condemned as [[doggerel]] or thought of as poetry composed casually, humor often makes a serious point in a subtle or subversive way. Many of the most renowned "serious" poets, such as Horace, Swift, Pope, and Auden, also excelled at light verse.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12053">{{math|}}The '''Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC)''' is an alphanumerical [[classification scheme]] collaboratively produced by staff of, and based on the coverage of, the two major mathematical reviewing databases, [[Mathematical Reviews]] and [[Zentralblatt MATH]]. The MSC is used by many mathematics [[Academic journal|journals]], which ask authors of [[research papers]] and expository articles to list subject codes from the Mathematics Subject Classification in their papers. The current version is MSC2010.

== Structure ==

The MSC is a hierarchical scheme, with three levels of structure. A classification can be two, three or five digits long, depending on how many levels of the classification scheme are used.

The first level is represented by a two digit number, the second by a letter, and the third by another two digit number. For example:

* '''53''' is the classification for [[differential geometry]]
* '''53A''' is the classification for classical differential geometry
* '''53A45''' is the classification for [[Euclidean vector|vector]] and [[tensor]] analysis

=== First level ===
At the top level, 64 mathematical disciplines are labeled with a unique 2 digit number. As well as the typical areas of mathematical research, there are top level categories for "[[History]] and [[Biography]]", "[[Mathematics Education]]", and for the overlap with different sciences. [[Physics]] (i.e. mathematical physics) is particularly well represented in the classification scheme with a number of different categories including:
* [[Fluid mechanics]]
* [[Quantum mechanics]]
* [[Geophysics]]
* [[Optics]] and [[electromagnetic theory]]

All valid MSC classification codes must have at least the first level identifier.

=== Second level ===

The second level codes are a single letter from the Latin alphabet. These represent specific areas covered by the first level discipline. The second level codes vary from discipline to discipline.

For example, for differential geometry, the top-level code is '''53''', and the second-level codes are:
* '''A''' for classical differential geometry
* '''B''' for local differential geometry
* '''C''' for global differential geometry
* '''D''' for symplectic geometry and contact geometry

In addition, the special second level code "-" is used for specific kinds of materials. These codes are of the form:

* '''53-00''' General reference works (handbooks, dictionaries, bibliographies, etc.)
* '''53-01''' Instructional exposition (textbooks, tutorial papers, etc.)
* '''53-02''' Research exposition (monographs, survey articles)
* '''53-03''' Historical (must also be assigned at least one classification number from Section 01)
* '''53-04''' Explicit machine computation and programs (not the theory of computation or programming)
* '''53-06''' Proceedings, conferences, collections, etc.

The second and third level of these codes are always the same - only the first level changes. For example, it is not valid to use '''53-''' as a classification. Either '''53''' on its own or, better yet, a more specific code should be used.

=== Third level ===

Third level codes are the most specific, usually corresponding to a specific kind of mathematical object or a well-known problem or research area.

The third-level code '''99''' exists in every category and means ''none of the above, but in this section''

== Using the scheme ==

The AMS recommends that papers submitted to its journals for publication have one primary classification and one or more optional secondary classifications. A typical MSC subject class line on a research paper looks like

MSC Primary 03C90; Secondary 03-02;

=={{anchor|MOS|AMS Classification|MSC1990|MSC2000|MSC2010}}History==
{{expand section|date=January 2014}}
According to the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS) help page about MSC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/help/field_help.html#mscp]&lt;/ref&gt; the MSC has been revised a number of times since 1940. Based on a scheme to organize AMS's ''Mathematical Offprint Service'' (MOS scheme), the ''AMS Classification'' was established for the classification of reviews in ''Mathematical Reviews'' in the 1960s. It saw various ad-hoc changes. Despite its shortcomings, [[Zentralblatt für Mathematik]] started to use it as well in the 1970s. In the late 1980s, a jointly revised scheme with more formal rules was agreed upon by Mathematical Reviews and Zentralblatt für Mathematik under the new name Mathematics Subject Classification. It saw various revisions as ''MSC1990'', ''MSC2000'' and ''MSC2010''.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Wegner. ''Indexierung mathematischer Literatur Die Revision der Mathematics Subject Classification MSC''. Institute of Mathematics, TU Berlin. http://fidmath.de/fileadmin/download/graz_wegner.ppt&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Mathematical Reviews and zbMATH started collecting input from the mathematical community on the next revision of MSC, which is due to be released in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[https://msc2020.org Announcement of the plan to revise the Mathematics Subject Classification]&lt;/ref&gt; The original classification of older items has not been changed. This can sometimes make it difficult to search for older works dealing with particular topics. Changes at the first level involved the subjects with (present) codes 03, 08, 12-20, 28, 37, 51, 58, 74, 90, 91, 92.

== Relation to other classification schemes ==

For physics papers the [[Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme]] (PACS) is often used. Due to the large overlap between mathematics and physics research it is quite common to see both PACS and MSC codes on research papers, particularly for multidisciplinary journals and repositories such as the [[arXiv]].

The [[ACM Computing Classification System]] (CCS) is a similar hierarchical classification scheme for [[computer science]]. There is some overlap between the AMS and ACM classification schemes, in subjects related to both mathematics and computer science, however the two schemes differ in the details of their organization of those topics.

The classification scheme used on the arXiv is chosen to reflect the papers submitted. As arXiv is multidisciplinary its classification scheme does not fit entirely with the MSC, ACM or PACS classification schemes. It is common to see codes from one or more of these schemes on individual papers.

==First-level areas==
The top level subjects under the MSC are, grouped here by common area names that are not part of the MSC:

{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}
A '''millennium''' (plural '''millennia''' or '''millenniums''') is a period equal to [[1000 (number)|1000]] [[year]]s,&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/millennium millennium]", ''Oxford Dictionaries'' (Oxford University Press, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; also called kiloyears. It derives from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|mille}}'', thousand, and ''{{lang|la|annus}}'', year. It is often, but not always, related to a particular [[calendar|dating system]].

Sometimes, it is used specifically for periods of a thousand years that begin at the starting point (initial reference point) of the calendar in consideration (typically the year "1"), or in later years that are whole number multiples of a thousand years after it. The term can also refer to an interval of time beginning on any date. Frequently in the latter case (and sometimes also in the former) it may have religious or theological implications (see [[millenarianism]]).

==Counting years==
There are two methods of counting years: current years (the count begins at the epoch) and elapsed years (the count is of completed years since the epoch).

The original method of counting years was [[ordinal number|ordinal]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} whether ''1st year [[AD]]'' or [[regnal year|regnal]] ''10th year of [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]]''. This ordinal numbering is still used in the names of the millennia and centuries, for example the ''1st millennium'' or the ''10th century'', and sometimes in the names of decades, e.g., ''1st decade of the 11th century''.

The main issues arise from the ''content'' of the various year ranges. Similar issues affect the ''contents'' of centuries. Decades are not subject to ambiguity, as they are named according to their leading numbers: the decade called the 1990s by its naming does not include 2000.

Those following ordinal year names naturally choose
* 2001–2100 (inclusive) as the current century
* 2001–3000 (inclusive) as the current millennium
Those who are influenced by the leading digit equally naturally choose
* 2000–2099 (inclusive) as the current century
* 2000–2999 (inclusive) as the current millennium

==Debate over millennium celebrations==
There are two viewpoints about how millennia should be thought of in practice. One viewpoint relies on the formal operation of the calendar, while the other appeals to [[Popular culture|popular culture]]. [[Stephen Jay Gould]] argued that the choice is arbitrary, and since the question revolves around rules made by people, rather than a natural phenomenon that is subject to experimental measurement, the matter cannot be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay, ''Questioning the Millennium'' (New York: Harmony Books, 1997), part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ISO 8601]], employed in [[ISO 8601 usage|a number of contexts]], uses the [[Astronomical year numbering|astronomical calendar]], in which year counting starts at 0. Thus, when using this calendar, the millennium starts at x000 and ends at x999. There was a popular debate leading up to the [[Millennium celebrations|celebrations of the year 2000]] as to whether the beginning of that year should be understood (and celebrated) as the beginning of a new millennium. Historically, there has been debate around the turn of previous decades, centuries, and millennia.

The issue is tied to the convention of using [[ordinal number]]s to count millennia (as in "the third millennium"), as opposed to "the two thousands", which is unambiguous as it does not depend on which year counting starts. The first convention is common in English speaking countries, but the latter is favored in for example Sweden (''tvåtusentalet'', which translates literally as the ''two thousands period'').

===Viewpoint 1: X001–Y000===
Those holding that the arrival of the new millennium should be celebrated in the transition from 2000 to 2001 (i.e., December 31, 2000 to January 1, 2001), argued that because the Gregorian calendar has no year zero, the millennia should be counted from 1 AD. Thus the first period of one thousand complete years runs from the beginning of 1 AD to the end of 1000 AD, and the beginning of the second millennium took place at the beginning of 1001.

[[Arthur C. Clarke]] gave this [[analogy]] (from a statement received by [[Reuters]]): "If the scale on your grocer's weighing machine began at 1 instead of 0, would you be happy when he claimed he'd sold you 10 kg of tea?" This statement illustrates the common confusion about the calendar.

If one counts from the beginning of AD 1 to the ending of AD 1000, one would have counted 1000&amp;nbsp;years. The next 1000&amp;nbsp;years (millennium) would begin on the first day of 1001. So the calendar has not 'cheated' anyone out of a year. Clarke made reference to this viewpoint in his book ''[[3001: The Final Odyssey]]'' referring to the Millennium Celebrations on December 31, 2000. In other words, the argument is based on the fact that the last year of the first two thousand years in the Gregorian calendar was 2000, not 1999.

===Viewpoint 2: X000–X999===
The "year 2000" has also been a popular phrase referring to an often [[utopia]]n future, or a year when stories in such a future were set, adding to its cultural significance. There was also media and public interest in the [[Y2K bug]]. People liked to compared their [[Odometer|odometer]] as a reason to celebrate the new millennium which goes from 1999 to 2000. Thus, the populist argument was that the new millennium should begin when the zeroes "rolled over" to 2000, i.e., the day after December 31, 1999. People&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/newmill.htm "When Does the New Millennium Begin?"] January 1, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; felt that the change of the hundreds digit in the year number, and the zeros rolling over, created a sense that a new century had begun.

This is similar to the common demarcation of decades by their most significant digits, e.g., naming the period 1980 to 1989 as the 1980s or "the eighties". Similarly, it would be valid to celebrate the year 2000 as a cultural event in its own right, and name the period 2000 to 2999 would be "the 2000s". In other words, the time period between 1 and 999 (999 years only) would be called the "0s" and the period between 1000 and 1999 would be the "1000s".

===Popular approach===
The popular&lt;ref name=AP&gt;Associated Press, [http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/01/news/mn-7177 "Y2K It Wasn't, but It Was a Party"], ''Los Angeles Times'', January 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; approach was to treat the end of 1999 as the end of a millennium and to hold millennium celebrations at midnight between December 31, 1999 and January 1, 2000, as per viewpoint 2. The cultural and psychological significance of the events listed above combined to cause celebrations to be observed one year earlier than the formal Gregorian date.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt; This does not establish that insistence on the formal Gregorian date is "incorrect", though some view it as pedantic.

Some event organisers hedged their bets by calling their 1999 celebrations things like "Click" referring to the [[odometer]]-like rolling over of the nines to zeros. A second approach was to adopt two different views on the millennium problem and celebrate the new millennium twice.

[[Stephen Jay Gould]], in his essay ''Dousing Diminutive Dennis' Debate (or DDDD = 2000)'' (''[[Dinosaur in a Haystack]]''), discussed the "high" versus "pop" culture interpretation of the transition. Gould noted that the high culture, strict construction had been the dominant viewpoint at the 20th century's beginning, but that the pop culture viewpoint dominated at its end. Gould also included comments on adjustments to the calendar, such as those by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] (the eponymous "Diminutive Dennis") and the timing of celebrations over different transitional periods. Further of his essays on this topic are collected in ''Questioning the Millennium: A Rationalist's Guide to a Precisely Arbitrary Countdown''.

The photographer added in camera movement ('''motion control''') by mounting the camera on a computerized telescope mount tracking in a random direction off the normal equatorial axis.]]
'''Motion control''' is a sub-field of [[automation]], encompassing the systems or sub-systems involved in moving parts of machines in a controlled manner. The main components involved typically include a [[motion controller]], an energy amplifier, and one or more [[Prime mover (disambiguation)|prime movers]] or [[actuator]]s. Motion control may be [[Open-loop controller|open loop]] or [[Closed-loop controller|closed loop]]. In open loop systems, the controller sends a command through the amplifier to the prime mover or actuator, and does not know if the desired motion was actually achieved. Typical systems include [[stepper motor]] or fan control. For tighter control with more precision, a measuring device may be added to the system (usually near the end motion). When the measurement is converted to a signal that is sent back to the controller, and the controller compensates for any error, it becomes a Closed loop System.

Typically the position or velocity of machines are controlled using some type of device such as a [[hydraulic pump]], [[linear actuator]], or [[electric motor]], generally a [[servomechanism|servo]]. Motion control is an important part of [[robotics]] and [[CNC]] [[machine tools]], however in these instances it is more complex than when used with specialized machines, where the [[kinematics]] are usually simpler. The latter is often called [[General Motion Control]] (GMC). Motion control is widely used in the packaging, printing, textile, [[semiconductor device fabrication|semiconductor production]], and assembly industries.
Motion Control encompasses every technology related to the movement of objects. It covers every motion system from micro-sized systems such as silicon-type micro induction actuators to micro-siml systems such as a space platform. But, these days, the focus of motion control is the special control technology of motion systems with electric actuators such as dc/ac servo motors. Control of robotic manipulators is also included in the field of motion control because most of robotic manipulators are driven by electrical servo motors and the key objective is the control of motion.&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=548386&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The basic architecture of a motion control system contains:
*A motion controller to generate set points (the desired output or motion profile) and (in closed loop systems) close a position or velocity [[feedback]] loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://motioncontrolresource.com/info-center/category/terminology.html |title=Motion Control Resource Info Center |accessdate=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A drive or [[amplifier]] to transform the control signal from the motion controller into energy that is presented to the actuator. Newer "intelligent" drives can close the position and velocity loops internally, resulting in much more accurate control.
*A [[Prime mover (disambiguation)|prime mover]] or [[actuator]] such as a hydraulic pump, pneumatic cylinder, linear actuator, or electric motor for output motion.
*In closed loop systems, one or more feedback sensors such as absolute and [[incremental encoder]]s, [[resolver (electrical)|resolvers]] or [[Hall effect]] devices to return the position or velocity of the actuator to the motion controller in order to close the position or velocity control loops.
*Mechanical components to transform the motion of the actuator into the desired motion, including: [[gear]]s, shafting, [[ball screw]], [[belt (mechanical)|belts]], [[linkage (mechanical)|linkages]], and linear and rotational [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearings]].

The interface between the motion controller and drives it controls is very critical when coordinated motion is required, as it must provide tight [[synchronization]].  Historically the only open interface was an analog signal, until open interfaces were developed that satisfied the requirements of coordinated motion control, the first being [[SERCOS interface|SERCOS]] in 1991 which is now enhanced to [[SERCOS III]]. Later interfaces capable of motion control include [[Ethernet/IP]], [[Profinet| Profinet IRT]], [[Ethernet Powerlink]], and [[EtherCAT]].

Common control functions include:
*Velocity control.
*Position (point-to-point) control: There are several methods for computing a motion trajectory. These are often based on the velocity profiles of a move such as a triangular profile, trapezoidal profile, or an S-curve profile.
*Pressure or Force control.
*[[Impedance control]]: This type of control is suitable for environment interaction and object manipulation, such as in robotics.
*Electronic gearing (or cam profiling): The position of a slave axis is mathematically linked to the position of a master axis. A good example of this would be in a system where two rotating drums turn at a given ratio to each other. A more advanced case of electronic gearing is electronic camming. With electronic camming, a slave axis follows a profile that is a function of the master position. This profile need not be salted, but it must be an animated [[function (mathematics)|function]]

'''Numerical linear algebra''' is the study of [[algorithms]] for performing [[linear algebra]] computations, most notably [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] operations, on [[computer]]s. It is often a fundamental part of [[engineering]] and [[computational science]] problems, such as [[image processing|image]] and [[signal processing]], [[telecommunication]], [[computational finance]], [[materials science]] simulations, [[structural biology]], [[data mining]], [[bioinformatics]], [[fluid dynamics]], and many other areas.  Such software relies heavily on the development, analysis, and implementation of state-of-the-art algorithms for solving various numerical linear algebra problems, in large part because of the role of matrices in [[finite difference method|finite difference]] and [[finite element method]]s.

Common problems in numerical linear algebra include computing the following: [[LU decomposition]], [[QR decomposition]], [[singular value decomposition]], [[eigenvalue]]s.

'''Orientalism''' is a term used by art historians and literary and [[cultural studies]] scholars for the imitation or depiction of aspects in [[Eastern world|West Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian and East Asian cultures]]. These depictions are usually done by writers, designers, and artists from the West. In particular, '''Orientalist painting''', depicting more specifically "the [[Middle East]]",&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 6&lt;/ref&gt; was one of the many specialisms of 19th-century [[academic art]], and the literature of Western countries took a similar interest in Oriental themes.

Since the publication of [[Edward Said]]'s ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' in 1978, much academic discourse has begun to use the term "Orientalism" to refer to a general patronizing Western attitude towards Middle Eastern, Asian, and North African societies. In Said's analysis, the West [[Essentialism|essentializes]] these societies as static and undeveloped—thereby fabricating a view of Oriental culture that can be studied, depicted, and reproduced. Implicit in this fabrication, writes Said, is the idea that Western society is developed, rational, flexible, and superior.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood Mamdani, ''Good Muslim, Bad Muslim: America, the Cold War, and the Roots of Terrorism'', New York: Pantheon, 2004; {{ISBN|0-375-42285-4}}; p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
Orientalism refers to the [[Orient]], in reference and opposition to the [[Occident]]; the East and the West, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Latin ''Oriens'', ''Oxford English Dictionary''. p. 000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. "Orientalism," New York: Vintage Books, 1979. p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt; The word Orient entered the English language as the [[Middle French]] ''orient''. The root word ''oriēns'', from the Latin ''Oriēns'', has synonymous denotations: The eastern part of the world; the sky whence comes the sun; the east; the rising sun, etc.; yet the denotation changed as a term of geography. In the "[[Monk's Tale]]" (1375), [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] wrote: "That they conquered many regnes grete / In the orient, with many a fair citee." The term "orient" refers to countries east of the Mediterranean Sea and Southern Europe. ''In Place of Fear'' (1952), [[Aneurin Bevan]] used an expanded denotation of the Orient that comprehended [[East Asia]]: "the awakening of the Orient under the impact of Western ideas". Edward Said said that Orientalism "enables the political, economic, cultural and social domination of the West, not just during colonial times, but also in the present."&lt;ref&gt;Said, Edward. "Orientalism," New York: Vintage Books, 1979: 357&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
In art history, the term Orientalism refers to the works of the Western artists who specialized in Oriental subjects, produced from their travels in [[Western Asia]], during the 19th century. In that time, artists and scholars were described as Orientalists, especially in France, where the dismissive use of the term "Orientalist" was made popular by the art critic [[Jules-Antoine Castagnary]].&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 20&lt;/ref&gt; Despite such social disdain for a style of [[Representation (arts)|representational art]], the [[Société des Peintres Orientalistes Français|French Society of Orientalist Painters]] was founded in 1893, with [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] as the honorary president;&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 74&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in Britain, the term Orientalist identified "an artist".&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the French Orientalist Painters Society changed the consciousness of practitioners towards the end of the 19th century, since artists could now see themselves as part of a distinct art movement.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, R., ''Orientalist Aesthetics: Art, Colonialism, and French North Africa, 1880-1930,'' 2003, pp 57 -78&lt;/ref&gt; As an art movement, Orientalist painting is generally treated as one of the many branches of 19th-century [[academic art]]; however, many different styles of Orientalist art were in evidence. Art historians tend to identify two broad types of Orientalist artist: the realists who carefully painted what they observed and those who imagined Orientalist scenes without ever leaving the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Mercedes Volait, "Middle Eastern collections of Orientalist Painting at the Turn of the 21st century: Paradoxical reversal or persistent misunderstanding?; François Pouillon and Jean-Claude Vatin, ''After Orientalism: Critical perspectives on Western Agency and Eastern Reappropriations," ''Leiden Studies in Islam and Society,'' pp 251-271, 2014, Online: &lt;http://www.brill.com/products/book/after-orientalism&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; French painters such as [[Eugène Delacroix]] (1798–1863) and [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] (1824–1904) are widely regarded as the leading luminaries of the Orientalist movement.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia.com, https://www.encyclopedia.com/literature-and-arts/art-and-architecture/art-general/orientalism&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oriental studies===
In the 18th and 19th centuries, the term [[Oriental studies|Orientalist]] identified a scholar who specialized in the languages and literatures of the [[Eastern world]]. Among such scholars were British officials of the [[East India Company]], who said that the [[Arab culture]], the [[culture of India]], and the [[Islamic culture]]s should be studied as equal to the cultures of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Macfie |first = A. L.|year = 2002 |title = Orientalism |publisher = Longman| location = London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0FrJAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn = 0582423864|ref = none| p = Ch One}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among such scholars is the philologist [[William Jones (philologist)|William Jones]], whose studies of [[Indo-European languages]] established modern [[philology]]. British [[Company rule in India|imperial strategy in India]] favored Orientalism as a technique for developing good relations with the natives—until the 1820s, when the influence of "anglicists" such as [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]] and [[John Stuart Mill]] led to the promotion of Anglocentric education.&lt;ref&gt;Holloway (2006), pp. 1–2. "The Orientalism espoused by Warren Hastings, William Jones and the early East India Company sought to maintain British domination over the Indian subcontinent through patronage of Hindu and Muslim languages and institutions, rather than through their eclipse by English speech and aggressive European acculturation."&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, [[Hebraists|Hebraism]] and [[Jewish studies]] gained popularity among British and German scholars in the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08624.html|title=Hebraists, Christian|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The academic field of [[Oriental studies]], which comprehended the cultures of the [[Near East]] and the [[Far East]], became the fields of [[Asian studies]] and [[Middle Eastern studies]].

===Critical studies===
In the book ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978), the cultural critic Edward Said redefined the term Orientalism to describe a pervasive Western tradition — academic and artistic — of prejudiced outsider-interpretations of the Eastern world, which was shaped by the cultural attitudes of European [[imperialism]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 24&lt;/ref&gt; The thesis of ''Orientalism'' develops [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s theory of [[cultural hegemony]], and [[Michel Foucault]]'s theorisation of [[discourse]] (the [[knowledge]]-and-[[Power (social and political)|power]] relation) to criticise the scholarly tradition of Oriental studies. Said criticised contemporary scholars who perpetuated the tradition of outsider-interpretation of [[Arab]]o-Islamic cultures, especially [[Bernard Lewis]] and [[Fouad Ajami]].&lt;ref&gt;''Orientalism'' (1978) Preface, 2003 ed. p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xypolia|first=Ilia|title=Orientations and Orientalism: The Governor Sir Ronald Storrs|journal=Journal of IslamicJerusalem Studies|year=2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=24–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The analyses are of Orientalism in European literature, especially French literature, and do not analyse [[visual art]] and [[Orientalist painting]]. In that vein, the art historian [[Linda Nochlin]] applied Said's methods of critical analysis to art, "with uneven results".&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 6, 11 (quoted), 23–25&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[academy]], the book ''Orientalism'' (1978) became a foundational text of [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial cultural studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xypolia|first=Ilia|title=Orientations and Orientalism: The Governor Sir Ronald Storrs|journal=Journal of Islamic Jerusalem Studies|year=2011|volume=11|issue=1|pages=25–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in relation to the cultural institution of [[citizenship]], Orientalism has rendered the concept of ''citizenship'' as a problem of [[epistemology]], because citizenship originated as a social institution of the Western world; as such, the problem of defining citizenship reconfigures the idea of ''Europe'' in time of crises.&lt;ref&gt;Mura, Andrea, (2015) "[https://www.academia.edu/21512966/Dis-orienting_Austerity_The_Indebted_Citizen_as_the_New_Soul_of_Europe Disorienting Austerity: The Indebted Citizen as the New Soul of Europe]" In Engin Isin (ed.), ''Citizenship After Orientalism: Transforming Political Theory''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, Said said that Orientalism, as an "idea of representation is a theoretical one: The Orient is a stage on which the whole East is confined" in order to make the Eastern world "less fearsome to the West";&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Said, Edward. "Orientalism," New York: Vintage Books, 1979: 363&lt;/ref&gt; that the developing world, primarily the West, is the cause of [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Said|first1=Edward|title=Orientalism|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JncXpQQoZAo|date=April 16, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in ''Empire: A Very Short Introduction'' (2000), Stephen Howe agreed with Said that Western nations and their empires were created by the exploitation of underdeveloped countries, by the extraction of wealth and labour from one country to another country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Howe|first1=Stephen|title=Empire:A Very Short Introduction|publisher=Oxford University press|pages=73–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In European architecture and design==
{{Further|Orientalism in early modern France}}
The [[Moresque]] style of [[Renaissance]] [[ornament (art)|ornament]] is a European adaptation of the Islamic [[arabesque]] that began in the late 15th century and was to be used in some types of work, such as [[bookbinding]], until almost the present day. Early architectural use of motifs lifted from the Indian subcontinent is known as [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]]. One of the earliest examples is the façade of [[Guildhall, London]] (1788–1789). The style gained momentum in the west with the publication of views of India by [[William Hodges]], and [[William Daniell|William]] and [[Thomas Daniell]] from about 1795. Examples of "Hindoo" architecture are [[Sezincote House]] (c. 1805) in [[Gloucestershire]], built for a [[nabob]] returned from [[Bengal]], and the [[Royal Pavilion]] in [[Brighton]].

''[[Turquerie]]'', which began as early as the late 15th century, continued until at least the 18th century, and included both the use of "Turkish" styles in the decorative arts, the adoption of Turkish costume at times, and interest in art depicting the [[Ottoman Empire]] itself. Venice, the traditional trading partner of the Ottomans, was the earliest centre, with France becoming more prominent in the 18th century.

''[[Chinoiserie]]'' is the catch-all term for the fashion for Chinese themes in decoration in Western Europe, beginning in the late 17th century and peaking in waves, especially [[Rococo]] Chinoiserie, ''c.'' 1740–1770. From the [[Renaissance]] to the 18th century, Western designers attempted to imitate the technical sophistication of Chinese ceramics with only partial success. Early hints of Chinoiserie appeared in the 17th century in nations with active East India companies: England (the [[East India Company]]), Denmark (the [[Danish East India Company]]), the Netherlands (the [[Dutch East India Company]]) and France (the [[French East India Company]]). Tin-glazed pottery made at [[Delft]] and other Dutch towns adopted genuine [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]-era [[blue and white porcelain]] from the early 17th century. Early ceramic wares made at [[Meissen]] and other centers of true [[porcelain]] imitated Chinese shapes for dishes, vases and [[teaware]]s (see [[Chinese export porcelain]]).

Pleasure pavilions in "Chinese taste" appeared in the formal parterres of late Baroque and Rococo German palaces, and in tile panels at [[Aranjuez]] near [[Madrid]]. [[Thomas Chippendale]]'s mahogany tea tables and china cabinets, especially, were embellished with fretwork glazing and railings, ''c.'' 1753–70. Sober ''homages'' to early Xing scholars' furnishings were also naturalized, as the ''tang'' evolved into a mid-Georgian side table and squared slat-back armchairs that suited English gentlemen as well as Chinese scholars. Not every adaptation of Chinese design principles falls within mainstream "chinoiserie". Chinoiserie media included imitations of lacquer and painted tin (tôle) ware that imitated japanning, early painted wallpapers in sheets, and ceramic figurines and table ornaments. Small [[pagoda]]s appeared on chimneypieces and full-sized ones in gardens. [[Kew]] has a magnificent garden pagoda designed by [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]]. The [[Wilhelma]] (1846) in [[Stuttgart]] is an example of [[Moorish Revival architecture]]. [[Leighton House Museum|Leighton House]], built for the artist [[Frederic Leighton]], has a conventional facade but elaborate Arab-style interiors, including original Islamic tiles and other elements as well as Victorian Orientalizing work.

After 1860, ''[[Japonism]],'' sparked by the importing of [[ukiyo-e]], became an important influence in the western arts. In particular, many modern French artists such as [[Claude Monet]] and [[Edgar Degas]] were influenced by the Japanese style. [[Mary Cassatt]], an American artist who worked in France, used elements of combined patterns, flat planes and shifting perspective of Japanese prints in her own images.&lt;ref&gt;The subject of Ives&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings of [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]'s ''[[The Peacock Room]]'' demonstrated how he used aspects of Japanese tradition and are some of the finest works of the genre. California architects [[Greene and Greene]] were inspired by Japanese elements in their design of the [[Gamble House (Pasadena, California)|Gamble House]] and other buildings.

[[Egyptian Revival architecture]] became popular in the early and mid-19th century and continued as a minor style into the early 20th century. [[Moorish Revival architecture]] began in the early 19th century in the German states and was particularly popular for building synagogues. [[Indo-Saracenic Revival architecture]] was a genre that arose in the late 19th century in the [[British Raj]].

==Orientalist art==
===Pre-19th century===
[[File:Gentile Bellini Madonna and Child Enthroned late 15th century.jpg|thumb|A "Bellini type" [[Islamic]] [[prayer rug]], seen from the top, at the feet of the [[Virgin Mary]], in [[Gentile Bellini]]'s ''Madonna and Child Enthroned'', late 15th century]]
Depictions of Islamic "[[Moors]]" and "Turks" (imprecisely named [[Muslim]] groups of [[southern Europe]], [[North Africa]] and [[West Asia]]) can be found in Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque art. In Biblical scenes in [[Early Netherlandish painting]], secondary figures, especially Romans, were given exotic costumes that distantly reflected the clothes of the [[Near East]]. The [[Biblical Magi|Three Magi]] in [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity scenes]] were an especial focus for this. In general art with Biblical settings would not be considered as Orientalist except where contemporary or historicist Middle Eastern detail or settings is a feature of works, as with some paintings by [[Gentile Bellini]] and others, and a number of 19th century works. Renaissance [[Venice]] had a phase of particular interest in depictions of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in painting and [[old master print|prints]]. Gentile Bellini, who travelled to [[Constantinople]] and painted the Sultan, and [[Vittore Carpaccio]] were the leading painters. By then the depictions were more accurate, with men typically dressed all in white. The depiction of [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting]] sometimes draws from Orientalist interest, but more often just reflects the prestige these expensive objects had in the period.&lt;ref&gt;King and Sylvester, throughout&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Étienne Liotard]] (1702–1789) visited [[Istanbul]] and painted numerous [[pastel]]s of Turkish domestic scenes; he also continued to wear Turkish attire for much of the time when he was back in Europe. The ambitious Scottish 18th-century artist [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]] found a solution to the problem of using modern dress, considered unheroic and inelegant, in [[history painting]] by using Middle Eastern settings with Europeans wearing local costume, as travelers were advised to do. His huge ''James Dawkins and Robert Wood Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'' (1758, now Edinburgh) elevates tourism to the heroic, with the two travelers wearing what look very like [[toga]]s. Many travelers had themselves painted in exotic Eastern dress on their return, including [[Lord Byron]], as did many who had never left Europe, including [[Madame de Pompadour]].&lt;ref&gt;Christine Riding, ''Travellers and Sitters: The Orientalist Portrait'', in Tromans, 48–75&lt;/ref&gt; The growing French interest in exotic Oriental luxury and lack of liberty in the 18th century to some extent reflected a pointed analogy with France's own [[absolute monarchy]].&lt;ref name="McCabe2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ina Baghdiantz McCabe|title=Orientalism in Early Modern France: Eurasian Trade, Exoticism and the Ancien Regime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XnS6lVLapI4C&amp;pg=PA134|accessdate=31 August 2013|date=15 July 2008|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-374-0|pages=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byron's poetry was highly influential in introducing Europe to the heady cocktail of [[Romanticism]] in exotic Oriental settings which was to dominate 19th century Oriental art.

===French Orientalism===

[[File:Ferdinand-Victor-Eugène Delacroix, French - The Death of Sardanapalus - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|240px|''[[The Death of Sardanapalus]]'', [[Eugène Delacroix]], 1827]]
French Orientalist painting was transformed by [[Napoleon]]'s ultimately unsuccessful [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invasion of Egypt and Syria]] in 1798–1801, which stimulated great public interest in [[Egyptology]], and was also recorded in subsequent years by Napoleon's court painters, especially [[Antoine-Jean Gros]], although the Middle Eastern campaign was not one on which he accompanied the army. Two of his most successful paintings, ''[[Bonaparte Visiting the Plague Victims of Jaffa]]'' (1804) and ''[[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Battle of Abukir]]'' (1806) focus on the Emperor, as he was by then, but include many Egyptian figures, as does the less effective ''Napoleon at the Battle of the Pyramids'' (1810). [[Anne-Louis Girodet de Roussy-Trioson]]'s ''La Révolte du Caire'' (1810) was another large and prominent example. A well-illustrated ''Description de l'Égypte'' was published by the French Government in twenty volumes between 1809 and 1828, concentrating on [[antiquities]].&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eugène Delacroix]]'s first great success, ''[[The Massacre at Chios]]'' (1824) was painted before he visited Greece or the East, and followed his friend [[Théodore Géricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'' in showing a recent incident in distant parts that had aroused public opinion. [[Greece]] was still fighting for independence from the Ottomans, and was effectively as exotic as the more Near Eastern parts of the empire. Delacroix followed up with ''[[Greece on the Ruins of Missolonghi]]'' (1827), commemorating a siege of the previous year, and ''[[The Death of Sardanapalus]]'', inspired by [[Lord Byron]], which although set in antiquity has been credited with beginning the mixture of sex, violence, lassitude and exoticism which runs through much French Orientalist painting.&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, 294–296; Tromans, 128&lt;/ref&gt; In 1832, Delacroix finally visited what is now [[Algeria]], recently conquered by the French, and [[Morocco]], as part of a diplomatic mission to the [[Sultan of Morocco]]. He was greatly struck by what he saw, comparing the North African way of life to that of the Ancient Romans, and continued to paint subjects from his trip on his return to France. Like many later Orientalist painters, he was frustrated by the difficulty of sketching women, and many of his scenes featured [[Jews]] or warriors on horses. However, he was apparently able to get into the women's' quarters or [[harem]] of a house to sketch what became ''[[Women of Algiers]]''; few later harem scenes had this claim to authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Le Bain Turc, by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|240px|Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, ''[[The Turkish Bath]]'', 1862]]
When Ingres, the director of the French ''Académie de peinture'', painted a highly colored vision of a ''[[Turkish bath]]'', he made his eroticized Orient publicly acceptable by his diffuse generalizing of the female forms (who might all have been the same model). More open sensuality was seen as acceptable in the exotic Orient.&lt;ref name="Tromans, 135"&gt;Tromans, 135&lt;/ref&gt; This imagery persisted in art into the early 20th century, as evidenced in [[Henri Matisse]]'s orientalist semi-nudes from his Nice period, and his use of Oriental costumes and patterns. Ingres' pupil [[Théodore Chassériau]] (1819–1856) had already achieved success with his nude ''[[The Toilette of Esther]]'' (1841, [[Louvre]]) and equestrian portrait of ''Ali-Ben-Hamet, Caliph of Constantine and Chief of the Haractas, Followed by his Escort'' (1846) before he first visited the East, but in later decades the [[steamship]] made travel much easier and increasing numbers of artists traveled to the Middle East and beyond, painting a wide range of Oriental scenes.

In many of these works, they portrayed the Orient as exotic, colorful and sensual, not to say [[stereotype]]d. Such works typically concentrated on Arab, Jewish, and other Semitic cultures, as those were the ones visited by artists as France became more engaged in North Africa. French artists such as [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]] painted many works depicting Islamic culture, often including lounging [[odalisque]]s. They stressed both lassitude and visual spectacle. Other scenes, especially in [[genre painting]], have been seen as either closely comparable to their equivalents set in modern-day or historical Europe, or as also reflecting an Orientalist mind-set in the Saidian sense of the term. Gérôme was the precursor, and often the master, of a number of French painters in the later part of the century whose works were often frankly salacious, frequently featuring scenes in harems, public baths and slave auctions (the last two also available with classical decor), and responsible, with others, for "the equation of Orientalism with the nude in pornographic mode";&lt;ref&gt;Tromans. 136&lt;/ref&gt; (''Gallery, below'')

===British Orientalism===
[[File:William Holman Hunt 002.jpg|thumb|left|190px|[[William Holman Hunt]], ''A Street Scene in Cairo; The Lantern-Maker's Courtship'', 1854–61]]
Though British political interest in the territories of the unravelling Ottoman Empire was as intense as in France, it was mostly more discreetly exercised. The origins of British Orientalist 19th-century painting owe more to religion than military conquest or the search for plausible locations for naked women. The leading British [[genre painter]], [[David Wilkie (artist)|Sir David Wilkie]] was 55 when he travelled to [[Istanbul]] and [[Jerusalem]] in 1840, dying off [[Gibraltar]] during the return voyage. Though not noted as a religious painter, Wilkie made the trip with a [[Protestant]] agenda to reform religious painting, as he believed that: "a [[Martin Luther]] in painting is as much called for as in theology, to sweep away the abuses by which our divine pursuit is encumbered", by which he meant traditional Christian [[iconography]]. He hoped to find more authentic settings and decor for Biblical subjects at their original location, though his death prevented more than studies being made. Other artists including the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] [[William Holman Hunt]] and [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] had similar motivations,&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 14 (quoted), 162–165&lt;/ref&gt; giving an emphasis on realism in British Orientalist art from the start.&lt;ref&gt;Nochlin, 289, disputing Rosenthal assertion, and insisting that "there must be some attempt to clarify ''whose'' reality we are talking about".&lt;/ref&gt; The French artist [[James Tissot]] also used contemporary Middle Eastern landscape and decor for Biblical subjects, with little regard for historical costumes or other fittings.

William Holman Hunt produced a number of major paintings of Biblical subjects drawing on his Middle Eastern travels, improvising variants of contemporary Arab costume and furnishings to avoid specifically Islamic styles, and also some landscapes and genre subjects. The biblical subjects included ''[[The Scapegoat (painting)|The Scapegoat]]'' (1856), ''[[The Finding of the Saviour in the Temple]]'' (1860), and ''[[The Shadow of Death]]'' (1871). ''[[The Miracle of the Holy Fire (painting)|The Miracle of the Holy Fire]]'' (1899) was intended as a picturesque satire on the local Eastern Christians, of whom, like most English visitors, Hunt took a very dim view. His ''A Street Scene in Cairo; The Lantern-Maker's Courtship'' (1854–61) is a rare contemporary narrative scene, as the young man feels his fiancé's face, which he is not allowed to see, through her veil, as a Westerner in the background beats his way up the street with his stick.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 16–17 and see index&lt;/ref&gt; This a rare intrusion of a clearly contemporary figure into an Orientalist scene; mostly they claim the picturesqueness of the historical painting so popular at the time, without the trouble of researching authentic costumes and settings.

When Gérôme exhibited ''For Sale; Slaves at Cairo'' at the [[Royal Academy]] in London in 1871, it was "widely found offensive", perhaps partly because the British liked to think they had successfully suppressed the [[slave trade]] in Egypt, also for cruelty and "representing fleshiness for its own sake".&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; But Rana Kabbani believes that "French Orientalist painting, as exemplified by the works of Gérôme, may appear more sensual, gaudy, gory and sexually explicit than its British counterpart, but this is a difference of style not substance ... Similar strains of fascination and repulsion convulsed their artists"&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 43&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, nudity and violence are more evident in British paintings set in the ancient world, and "the iconography of the ''[[odalisque]]'' ... the Oriental [[sex slave]] whose image is offered up to the viewer as freely as she herself supposedly was to her master – is almost entirely French in origin",&lt;ref name="Tromans, 135"/&gt; though taken up with enthusiasm by Italian and other painters.

[[John Frederick Lewis]], who lived for several years in a traditional mansion in [[Cairo]], painted highly detailed works showing both realistic [[Genre painting|genre scenes]] of Middle Eastern life and more idealized scenes in upper class Egyptian interiors with no traces of Western cultural influence yet apparent. His careful and seemingly affectionate representation of Islamic architecture, furnishings, screens, and costumes set new standards of realism, which influenced other artists, including Gérôme in his later works. He "never painted a nude", and his wife modelled for several of his harem scenes,&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, quote 135; 134 on his wife; generally: 22–32, 80–85, 130–135, and see index&lt;/ref&gt; which, with the rare examples by the classicist painter [[Lord Leighton]], imagine "the harem as a place of almost English domesticity, ... [where]... women's fully clothed respectability suggests a moral healthiness to go with their natural good looks".&lt;ref name="Tromans, 135"/&gt;

Other artists concentrated on [[landscape painting]], often of desert scenes, including [[Richard Dadd]] and [[Edward Lear]]. [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]] (1796–1864) produced architectural and landscape views, many of [[antiquities]], and published very successful books of [[lithograph]]s from them.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 102–125, covers landscape&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian Orientalist art was largely concerned with the areas of [[Central Asia]] that Russia was conquering during the century, and also in historical painting with the [[Mongol]]s who had dominated Russia for much of the Middle Ages, who were rarely shown in a good light. [[Nationalist]] historical painting in [[Central Europe]] and the [[Balkans]] dwelt on Turkish oppression, with [[battle scene]]s and maidens about to be raped.

The Saidian analysis has not prevented a strong revival of interest in, and collecting of, 19th century Orientalist works since the 1970s, the latter was in large part led by Middle Eastern buyers.&lt;ref&gt;Tromans, 7, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors and composers are not commonly referred to as "Orientalist" in the way that artists are, and relatively few specialized in Oriental topics or styles, or are even best known for their works including them. But many major figures, from Mozart to Flaubert, have produced significant works with Oriental subjects or treatments. [[Lord Byron]] with his four long "Turkish tales" in poetry, is one of the most important writers to make exotic fantasy Oriental settings a significant theme in the literature of [[Romanticism]]. Verdi's opera ''Aida'' (1871) is set in Egypt as portrayed through the content and the visual spectacle. "Aida" depicts a militaristic Egypt's tyranny over Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Beard and Gloag 2005, 128&lt;/ref&gt;

Irish Orientalism had a particular character, drawing on various beliefs about early historical links between Ireland and the East, few of which are now regarded as historically correct. The mythical [[Milesians (Irish)|Milesians]] are one example of this. The Irish were also conscious of the views of other nations seeing them as comparably backward to the East, and Europe's "backyard Orient".&lt;ref&gt;Lennon, Joseph. "Irish Orientalism," New York: Syracuse University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===In music===
In music, Orientalism may be applied to styles occurring in different periods, such as the ''alla Turca'', used by multiple composers including [[Mozart]] and [[Beethoven]].&lt;ref name="Beard and Gloag 2005, 129"&gt;Beard and Gloag 2005, 129&lt;/ref&gt; The American musicologist [[Richard Taruskin]] has identified in 19th-century Russian music a strain of Orientalism: "the East as a sign or metaphor, as imaginary geography, as historical fiction, as the reduced and totalized other against which we construct our (not less reduced and totalized) sense of ourselves".&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Taruskin concedes Russian composers, unlike those in France and Germany, felt an "ambivalence" to the theme since "Russia was a contiguous empire in which Europeans, living side by side with 'orientals', identified (and intermarried) with them far more than in the case of other colonial powers".&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Taruskin characterizes Orientalism in Romantic Russian music as having melodies "full of close little ornaments and melismas",&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; chromatic accompanying lines, drone bass&lt;ref name="taruskin165"&gt;Taruskin (1997): p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;—characteristics which were used by [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]], [[Mily Balakirev|Balakirev]], [[Alexander Borodin|Borodin]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Sergei Lyapunov|Lyapunov]], and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninov]]. These musical characteristics evoke "not just the East, but the seductive East that emasculates, enslaves, renders passive. In a word, it signifies the promise of the experience of ''nega'', a prime attribute of the orient as imagined by the Russians. ... In opera and song, ''nega'' often simply denotes S-E-X a la russe, desired or achieved."&lt;ref name="taruskin165" /&gt;

Orientalism is also traceable in music that is considered to have effects of [[exoticism]], including the ''[[japonisme]]'' in [[Claude Debussy]]'s piano music all the way to the [[sitar]] being used in recordings by [[the Beatles]].&lt;ref name="Beard and Gloag 2005, 129"/&gt;

===In literature===
The Romantic movement in literature began in 1785 and ended around 1830. The term "Romantic" references the ideas and culture that writers of the time reflected in their work. During this time, the culture and objects of the East began to have a profound effect on Europe. Extensive traveling by artists and members of the European elite brought travelogues and sensational tales back to the West creating a great interest in all things "foreign". Romantic Orientalism incorporates African and Asian geographic locations, well-known colonial and "native" personalities, folklore, and philosophies to create a literary environment of colonial exploration from a distinctly European worldview. The current trend in analysis of this movement references a belief in this literature as a mode to justify European colonial endeavors with the expansion of territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romantic Orientalism: Overview|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/nael/romantic/topic_4/welcome.htm|website=The Norton Anthology of English Literature|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his novel ''[[Salammbô (novel)|Salammbô]]'', [[Gustave Flaubert]] used ancient [[Carthage]] in North Africa as a [[foil (literature)|foil]] to ancient [[Rome]]. He portrayed its culture as morally corrupting and suffused with dangerously alluring eroticism. This novel proved hugely influential on later portrayals of ancient [[Semitic cultures]].

===In film===
Said argues that the continuity of Orientalism into the present can be found in influential images, particularly through the [[Cinema of the United States]], as the West has now grown to include the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geographies of Postcolonialism|last = Sharp|first = Joanne|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] feature film, such as the ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' series, ''[[The Mummy (franchise)|The Mummy]]'' films, and Disney's ''[[Aladdin (franchise)|Aladdin]]'' film series demonstrate the imagined geographies of the East.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The films usually portray the lead heroic characters as being from the Western world, while the villains often come from the East.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The representation of the Orient has continued in film, although this representation does not necessarily have any truth to it.

The overly sexualized character of [[Princess Jasmine]] in ''Aladdin'' is simply a continuation of the paintings from the 19th century, where women were represented as erotic, sexualized male fantasies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geographies of postcolonialism|last = Sharp|first = Joanne|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Teahouse of the August Moon (film)|The Tea House of the August Moon]]'' (1956), as argued by Pedro Iacobelli, there are tropes of orientalism. He notes, that the film "tells us more about the Americans and the American's image of Okinawa rather than about the Okinawan people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}} &lt;/ref&gt;The film characterizes the Okinawans as "merry but backward" and "de-politicized", which ignored the real-life Okinawan political protests over forceful land acquisition by the American military at the time.

Kimiko Akita, in "Orientalism and the Binary of Fact and Fiction in Memoirs of a Geisha", argues that ''[[Memoirs of a Geisha (film)|Memoirs of a Geisha]]'' (2005) contains orientalist tropes and deep "cultural misrepresentations". She states that ''Memoirs of a Geish]'' "reinforces the idea of Japanese culture and geisha as exotic, backward, irrational, dirty, profane, promiscuous, bizarre, and enigmatic".

===In dance===
During the Romantic Period of the 19th century, [[ballet]] developed a preoccupation with the exotic. This exoticism ranged from ballets set in Scotland to those based on ethereal creatures. By the later part of the century, ballets were capturing the presumed essence of the mysterious East. These ballets often included sexual themes and tended to be based on assumptions of people rather than on concrete facts. Orientalism is apparent in numerous ballets.

The Orient motivated several major ballets, which have survived since the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. ''Le Corsaire'' premiered in 1856 at the Paris Opera, with choreography by [[Joseph Mazilier]].&lt;ref name="abt corsaire"&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Corsaire|url=http://www.abt.org/education/archive/ballets/corsairefl.html|website=ABT|publisher=Ballet Theatre Foundation, Inc.|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marius Petipa]] re-choreographed the ballet for the Maryinsky Ballet in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1899.&lt;ref name="abt corsaire" /&gt; Its complex storyline, loosely based on Lord Byron's poem,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Au|first1=Susan|title=Ballet and Modern Dance|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; takes place in Turkey and focuses on a love story between a pirate and a beautiful slave girl. Scenes include a bazaar where women are sold to men as slaves, and the Pasha's Palace, which features his harem of wives.&lt;ref name="abt corsaire" /&gt; In 1877, Marius Petipa choreographed ''La Bayadere'', the love story of an Indian temple dancer and Indian warrior. This ballet was based on Kalidasa's play ''Sakuntala''.&lt;ref name=Au&gt;{{cite book|last1=Au|first1=Susan|title=Ballet and Modern Dance|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''La Bayadere'' used vaguely Indian costuming, and incorporated Indian inspired hand gestures into classical ballet. In addition, it included a 'Hindu Dance,' motivated by Kathak, an Indian dance form.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Another ballet, ''Sheherazade'', choreographed by Michel Fokine in 1910 to music by Nicholas Rimsky-Korsakov, is a story involving a shah's wife and her illicit relations with a Golden Slave, originally played by Vaslav Nijinsky.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; The ballet's controversial fixation on sex includes an orgy in an oriental harem. When the shah discovers the actions of his numerous wives and their lovers, he orders the deaths of those involved.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; ''Sheherazade'' was loosely based on folktales of questionable authenticity.

Several lesser-known ballets of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century also reveal Orientalism. For instance, in Petipa's ''Pharaoh's Daughter'' (1862), an Englishman imagines himself, in an opium-induced dream, as an Egyptian boy who wins the love of the Pharaoh's daughter, Aspicia.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Aspicia's costume consisted of 'Egyptian' décor on a tutu.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Another ballet, Hippolyte Monplaisir's ''Brahma'', which premiered in 1868 in La Scala, Italy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jowitt|first1=Deborah|title=Time and the Dancing Image|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a story that involves romantic relations between a slave girl and Brahma, the Hindu god, when he visits earth.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; In addition, in 1909, Serge Diagilev included ''Cleopatra'' in Ballet's Russe's repertory. With its theme of sex, this revision of Fokine's ''Une Nuit d' Egypte'' combined the "exoticism and grandeur" that audiences of this time craved.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt;

As one of the pioneers of modern dance in America, [[Ruth St Denis]] also explored Orientalism in her dancing. Her dances were not authentic; she drew inspiration from photographs, books, and later from museums in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Au|first1=Susan|title=Ballet and modern Dance|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson, Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the exoticism of her dances catered to the interests of society women in America.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; She included ''Radha'' and ''The Cobras'' in her 'Indian' program in 1906. In addition, she found success in Europe with another Indian-themed ballet, ''The Nautch'' in 1908. In 1909, upon her return to America, St Denis created her first 'Egyptian' work, ''Egypta''.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt; Her preference for Orientalism continued, culminating with ''Ishtar of the Seven Gates'' in 1923, about a Babylonian goddess.&lt;ref name="Au" /&gt;

While Orientalism in dance climaxed in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it is still present in modern times. For instance, major ballet companies regularly perform ''Le Corsaire'', ''La Bayadere'', and ''Sheherazade''. Furthermore, Orientalism is also found within newer versions of ballets. In versions of ''The Nutcracker'', such as the 2010 [[American Ballet Theatre]] production, the Chinese dance uses an arm position with the arms bent at a ninety-degree angle and the index fingers pointed upwards, while the Arabian dance uses two dimensional bent arm movements. Inspired by ballets of the past, stereotypical 'Oriental' movements and arm positions have developed and remain.

The Theosophical Society had a major influence on [[Buddhist modernism]]{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and [[Hindu reform movements]].{{sfn|Sinari|2000}}{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} Between 1878 and 1882, the Society and the [[Arya Samaj]] were united as the [[Theosophical Society of the Arya Samaj]].{{sfn|Johnson|1994|p=107}} [[Helena Blavatsky]], along with [[Henry Steel Olcott|H. S. Olcott]] and [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], was instrumental in the Western transmission and revival of [[Theravada Buddhism]].{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=98}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1996|p=185-188}}{{sfn|Fields|1992|p=83-118}}

Another major influence was [[Vivekananda]],{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=189-193}}{{sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79-81}} who popularised his modernised interpretation{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}} of [[Advaita Vedanta]] during the later 19th and early 20th century in both India and the West,{{sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79-81}} emphasising ''anubhava'' ("personal experience") over scriptural authority.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=1}}

==Eastern views of the West==
{{confusing|section|reason=Are we talking about Eastern views of the West, or Western views of the East, or both? This section is confusing|date=May 2018}}
The term "re-orientalism" was used by Lisa Lau and Ana Cristina Mendes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/886477672|title=Re-orientalism and South Asian identity politics : the oriental other within|last=editor.|first=Lau, Lisa, editor.

"Re-Orientalism differs from Orientalism in its manner of and reasons for referencing the West: while challenging the metanarratives of Orientalism, re-Orientalism sets up alternative metanarratives of its own in order to articulate eastern identities, simultaneously deconstructing and reinforcing Orientalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mendes|first=Ana Cristina|last2=Lau|first2=Lisa|date=December 2014|title=India through re-Orientalist Lenses|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUri=%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1080%2F1369801X.2014.984619|journal=Interventions|language=en|volume=17|issue=5|pages=706–727|doi=10.1080/1369801x.2014.984619|issn=1369-801X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[Occidentalism]]" is often used to refer to negative views of the Western world found in Eastern societies and is founded on the sense of nationalism that spread in reaction to colonialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url =http://www.erudit.org/revue/jcha/2006/v17/n2/016587ar.pdf |title = Edward Said: Orientalism and Occidentalism|last = Lary|first = Diana|date = 2006|journal = Journal of the Canadian Historical Association / Revue de la Société historique du Canada|volume = 17| number = 2 |p = 3–15|doi = 10.7202/016587ar|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The action of "[[othering]]" cultures occurs when groups are labeled as different due to characteristics that distinguish them from the perceived norm.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Other|last = Mountz|first = Alison|date = |journal = |doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Said]], the author of the book ''Orientalism'', argued that western powers and influential individuals such as social scientists and artists othered "the Orient".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The evolution of ideologies is often initially embedded in the language, and continues to ripple through the fabric of society by taking over the culture, economy and political sphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Orientalism at Home: The Case of 'Canada's Toughest Neighbourhood'|last = Richardson|first = Chris|date = 2014|journal = Project Muse|volume = 27|pages = 75|doi = 10.3828/bjcs.2014.5|pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Said's criticism of Western Orientalism is based on what he describes as articularizing trends. These ideologies are present in Asian works by Indian, Chinese, and Japanese writers and artists, in their views of Western culture and tradition.

A particularly significant development is the manner in which Orientalism has taken shape in non-Western cinema, as for instance in Hindi cinema.

Said has been accused of Occidentalizing the west in his critique Orientalism, ''i.e.'' of being guilty of falsely characterizing the West in the same way that he accuses Western scholars of falsely characterizing the East.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Geographies of Postcolonialism|last = Sharp|first = Jo|publisher = Sage|year = 2008|isbn = 978-1-4129-0778-1|location = London|pages = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Said essentialized the west by creating a homogeneous image of the area. Currently, the west consists not only of Europe, but also the United States, which has become more influential and dominant over the years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23197">*The following [[outline (list)|outline]] is presented as an overview and topical guide to air pollution dispersion:

'''Air pollution dispersion''' &amp;ndash;  distribution of air pollution into the atmosphere. [[Air pollution]] is the introduction of particulates, biological molecules, or other harmful materials into Earth's atmosphere, causing disease, death to humans, damage to other living organisms such as food crops, or the natural or built environment. Air pollution may come from anthropogenic or natural sources. Dispersion refers to what happens to the pollution during and after its introduction; understanding this may help in identifying and controlling it.  Air pollution dispersion has become the focus of environmental conservationists and governmental environmental protection agencies (local, state, province and national) of many countries (which have adopted and used much of the terminology of this field in their laws and regulations) regarding [[air pollution control]].

==Air pollution emission plumes==
[[File:Gaussian Plume (SVG).svg|thumb|right|333px|Visualization of a buoyant Gaussian air pollutant dispersion plume]]

[[Air pollution emission plume]] &amp;ndash; flow of pollutant in the form of vapor or smoke released into the air. Plumes are of considerable importance in the atmospheric dispersion modelling of air pollution. There are three primary types of air pollution [[Air pollutants|emission]] [[Plume (hydrodynamics)|plumes]]:
* '''[[Buoyant]] plumes''' — Plumes which are lighter than air because they are at a higher [[temperature]] and lower [[density]] than the ambient air which surrounds them, or because they are at about the same temperature as the ambient air but have a lower [[molecular mass|molecular weight]] and hence lower density than the ambient air. For example, the emissions from the [[flue gas stacks]] of industrial [[furnace]]s are buoyant because they are considerably warmer and less dense than the ambient air. As another example, an emission plume of [[methane]] gas at ambient air temperatures is buoyant  because methane has a lower molecular weight than the ambient air.
* '''[[Density|Dense]] gas plumes''' — Plumes which are heavier than air because they have a higher density than the surrounding ambient air. A plume may have a higher density than air because it has a higher molecular weight than air (for example, a plume of [[carbon dioxide]]). A plume may also have a higher density than air if the plume is at a much lower temperature than the air. For example, a plume of [[evaporation|evaporated]] gaseous methane from an accidental release of [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) may be as cold as -161&amp;nbsp;°C.
* '''Passive or neutral plumes''' — Plumes which are neither lighter or heavier than air.

==Air pollution dispersion models==

There are five types of air pollution dispersion models, as well as some hybrids of the five types:&lt;ref&gt;[[List of atmospheric dispersion models]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Box model''' — The box model is the simplest of the model types.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apollo.lsc.vsc.edu/classes/met130/notes/chapter18/dispersion_intro.html Air Pollution Dispersion: Ventilation Factor] by Dr. Nolan Atkins, Lyndon State College&lt;/ref&gt; It assumes the [[airshed]] (i.e., a given volume of [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] air in a geographical region) is in the shape of a box. It also assumes that the air pollutants inside the box are homogeneously distributed and uses that assumption to estimate the average pollutant [[concentration]]s anywhere within the airshed. Although useful, this model is very limited in its ability to accurately predict dispersion of air pollutants over an airshed because the assumption of homogeneous pollutant distribution is much too simple.
*'''[[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|Gaussian model]]''' — The Gaussian model is perhaps the oldest (circa 1936) &lt;ref&gt;Bosanquet, C.H. and Pearson, J.L. (1936).''The spread of smoke and gases from chimney'', Trans. Faraday Soc., 32:1249.&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps the most commonly used model type. It assumes that the air pollutant  dispersion has a [[Normal distribution|Gaussian distribution]], meaning that the pollutant distribution has a normal probability distribution. Gaussian models are most often used for predicting the dispersion of continuous, buoyant air pollution plumes originating from  ground-level or elevated sources. Gaussian models may also be used for predicting the dispersion of non-continuous air pollution plumes (called ''puff models''). The primary algorithm used in Gaussian modeling is the ''Generalized Dispersion Equation For A Continuous Point-Source Plume''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|Atmospheric Dispersion Modeling]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beychok&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, Milton R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} (Chapter 8, page 124)&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates|Lagrangian]] model''' — a Lagrangian dispersion model mathematically follows pollution plume parcels (also called particles) as the parcels move in the atmosphere and they model the motion  of the parcels as a [[random walk]] process. The Lagrangian model then calculates the air pollution dispersion by computing the statistics of the trajectories of a large number of the pollution plume parcels. A Lagrangian model uses a moving [[frame of reference]]&lt;ref name=JRC&gt;[http://rem.jrc.ec.europa.eu/etex/37.htm Features of Dispersion Models] publication of the [[European Union]] Joint Research Centre (JRC)&lt;/ref&gt; as the parcels move from their initial location. It is said that an observer of a Lagrangian model follows along with the plume.
*'''[[Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates|Eulerian]] model''' — an Eulerian dispersion model is similar to a Lagrangian model in that it also tracks the movement of a large number of pollution plume parcels as they move from their initial location. The most important difference between the two models is that the Eulerian model uses a fixed three-dimensional [[Cartesian grid]]&lt;ref name=JRC/&gt; as a frame of reference rather than a moving frame of reference. It is said that an observer of an Eulerian model watches the plume go by.
*'''Dense gas model''' — Dense gas models are models that simulate the dispersion of dense gas pollution plumes (i.e., pollution plumes that are heavier than air). The three most commonly used {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} {{Dubious|date=December 2011}} dense gas models are:

==Air pollutant emission ==

[[File:AirPollutionSource.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Air pollution emission source]]

* Types of air pollutant emission sources &amp;ndash; named for their characteristics
** Sources, by shape &amp;ndash; there are four basic shapes which an emission source may have. They are:
*** Point source — single, identifiable source of air pollutant emissions (for example, the emissions from a [[combustion]] furnace flue gas stack). Point sources are also characterized as being either elevated or at ground-level. A point source has no [[geometric]] dimensions.
*** Line source — one-dimensional source of air pollutant emissions (for example, the emissions from the [[traffic|vehicular traffic]] on a roadway).
*** Area source — two-dimensional source of diffuse air pollutant emissions (for example, the emissions from a [[forest fire]], a [[landfill]] or the evaporated vapors from a large spill of volatile liquid).
*** Volume source — three-dimensional source of diffuse air pollutant emissions. Essentially, it is an area source with a third (height) dimension (for example, the fugitive gaseous emissions from [[piping]] [[flange]]s, [[valves]] and other equipment at various heights within industrial facilities such as [[oil refineries]] and [[petrochemical]] plants). Another example would be the emissions from an automobile paint shop with multiple roof vents or multiple open windows.
** Sources, by motion
*** [[Major stationary source|Stationary source]] &amp;ndash; [[flue gas]] stacks are examples of stationary sources
*** Mobile source &amp;ndash; [[bus]]es are examples of mobile sources
** Sources, by urbanization level &amp;ndash; whether the source is within a city or not is relevant in that urban areas constitute a so-called ''heat island'' and the heat rising from an urban area causes the atmosphere above an urban area to be more turbulent than the atmosphere above a rural area
*** Urban source &amp;ndash; emission is in an urban area
*** Rural source &amp;ndash; emission is in a rural area
** Sources, by elevation
*** Surface or ground-level source
*** Near surface source
*** Elevated source
** Sources, by duration
*** Puff or intermittent source &amp;ndash; short term sources (for example, many [[Accidental Release Source Terms|accidental emission releases]] are short term puffs)
*** Continuous source &amp;ndash; long term source (for example, most flue gas stack emissions are continuous)

==Characterization of atmospheric turbulence==

Effect of [[turbulence]] on dispersion &amp;ndash; turbulence increases the [[Entrainment (engineering)|entrainment]] and mixing of unpolluted air into the plume and thereby acts to reduce the concentration of pollutants in the plume (i.e., enhances the plume dispersion). It is therefore important to categorize the amount of atmospheric turbulence present at any given time. This type of disperson is scale dependent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walton|first=John|date=April 1973|title=Scale-Dependent Diffusion|url=|journal=Journal of Applied Meteorology|volume=|pages=548|doi=10.1175/1520-0450(1973)012&lt;0547:sdd&gt;2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such that, for flows where the cloud of pollutant is smaller than the largest eddies present, there will be mixing. There is no limit on the size on mixing motions in the atmosphere and therefore bigger clouds will experience larger and stronger mixing motions. And hence, this type of dispersion is scale dependent.

===The Pasquill atmospheric stability classes===

[[Pasquill atmospheric stability classes]] &amp;ndash; oldest and, for a great many years, the most commonly used method of categorizing the amount of atmospheric turbulence present was the method developed by [[Frank Pasquill|Pasquill]] in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;Pasquill, F. (1961). ''The estimation of the dispersion of windborne material'', The Meteorological Magazine, vol 90, No. 1063, pp 33-49.&lt;/ref&gt; 
He categorized the atmospheric turbulence into six '''stability classes''' named A, B, C, D, E and F with class A being the most unstable or most turbulent class, and class F  the most stable or least turbulent class. 
* Table 1 lists the six classes 
* Table 2 provides the meteorological conditions that define each class. The stability classes demonstrate a few key ideas. Solar radiation increases [[atmospheric instability]] through warming of the Earth's surface so that warm air is below cooler (and therefore denser) air promoting vertical mixing. Clear nights push conditions toward stable as the ground cools faster establishing more stable conditions and inversions. Wind increases vertical mixing, breaking down any type of stratification and pushing the stability class towards neutral (D).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pasquill|first=F.|date=February 1961|title=The estimation of the dispersion of windborne material|url=|journal=Meteorological Magazine|volume=90|pages=33–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advanced methods of categorizing atmospheric turbulence===

[[Advanced air pollution dispersion model]]s &amp;ndash; they do not categorize atmospheric turbulence by using the simple meteorological parameters commonly used in defining the six Pasquill classes as shown in Table 2 above. The more advanced models use some form of [[Monin-Obukhov length|Monin-Obukhov similarity theory.]] Some examples include:
* [[AERMOD]]&lt;ref name= AERMOD&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/scram001/7thconf/aermod/aermod_mfd.pdf AERMOD:Description of Model Formulation]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; US EPA's most advanced model, no longer uses the Pasquill stability classes to categorize atmospheric turbulence. Instead, it uses the surface [[roughness length]] and the [[Monin-Obukhov length]].
* [[ADMS 4]],&lt;ref name=ADMS&gt;[http://www.cerc.co.uk/environmental-software/ADMS-model.html ADMS 4] Description of the model by the developers, Cambridge Environmental Research Consultants.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; [[United Kingdom]]'s most advanced model, uses the Monin-Obukhov length, the [[boundary layer]] height and the windspeed to categorize the atmospheric turbulence.

==Miscellaneous other terminology==

::''(Work on this section is continuously in progress)''

*'''Building effects or downwash''': When an air pollution plume flows over nearby buildings or other structures, turbulent eddies are formed in the downwind side of the building. Those eddies cause a plume from a stack source located within about five times the height of a nearby building or structure to be forced down to the ground much sooner than it would if a building or structure were not present. The effect can greatly increase the resulting near-by ground-level pollutant concentrations downstream of the building or structure. If the pollutants in the plume are subject to depletion by contact with the ground ([[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]], for example), the concentration increase just downstream of the building or structure will decrease the concentrations further downstream.
*'''[[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|Deposition]]''' of the pollution plume components to the underlying surface can be defined as either dry or wet deposition:
**'''Dry deposition''' is the removal of gaseous or particulate material from the pollution plume by contact with the ground surface or vegetation (or even water surfaces) through transfer processes such as [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]] and gravitational  [[sedimentation]].  This may be calculated by means of a ''[[Deposition (Aerosol physics)|deposition velocity]]'', which is related to the resistance of the underlying surface to the transfer.
**'''Wet deposition''' is the removal of pollution plume components by the action of rain. The wet deposition of radionuclides in a pollution plume by a burst of rain often forms so called ''hot spots'' of radioactivity on the underlying surface.
*'''[[Inversion (meteorology)|Inversion layers]]''':&lt;ref  name=Beychok/&gt; Normally, the air near the [[Earth]]'s surface is warmer than the air above it because the atmosphere is heated from below as solar radiation warms the Earth's surface, which in turn then warms the layer of the atmosphere directly above it. Thus, the atmospheric temperature normally decreases with increasing altitude. However, under certain meteorological conditions, atmospheric layers may form in which the temperature increases with increasing altitude. Such layers are called inversion layers. When such a layer forms at the Earth's surface, it is called a '''surface inversion'''. When an inversion layer forms at some distance above the earth, it is called an '''inversion aloft''' (sometimes referred to as a ''[[capping inversion]]''). The air within an inversion aloft is very stable with very little vertical motion. Any rising parcel of air within the inversion soon expands, thereby [[Adiabatic process#Adiabatic heating and cooling|adiabatically cooling]] to a lower temperature than the surrounding air and the parcel stops rising. Any sinking parcel soon compresses adiabatically to a higher temperature than the surrounding air and the parcel stops sinking. Thus, any air pollution plume that enters an inversion aloft will undergo very little vertical mixing unless it has sufficient [[momentum]] to completely pass through the inversion aloft. That is one reason why an inversion aloft is sometimes called a capping inversion.
*'''Mixing height''':&lt;ref name=Beychok/&gt; When an inversion aloft is formed, the atmospheric layer between the Earth's surface and the bottom of the inversion aloft is known as the '''mixing layer''' and the distance between the Earth's surface and the bottom of inversion aloft is known as the '''mixing height'''. Any air pollution plume dispersing beneath an inversion aloft will be limited in vertical mixing to that which occurs beneath the bottom of the inversion aloft (sometimes called the ''lid''). Even if the pollution plume penetrates the inversion, it will not undergo any further significant vertical mixing. As for a pollution plume passing completely through an inversion layer aloft, that rarely occurs unless the pollution plume's source stack is very tall and the inversion lid is fairly low.

{{wikisource}}
The '''Pact of Umar''' (also known as the '''Covenant of Umar''', '''Treaty of Umar''' or '''Laws of Umar'''; {{lang-ar|شروط عمر}} or {{lang|ar|عهد عمر}} or {{lang|ar|عقد عمر}}), is an [[apocryphal]] [[treaty]] between the [[Muslims]] and the [[Christians]] of either [[Syria]], [[Mesopotamia]],{{sfn|Roggema|2009|p=361}} or [[Jerusalem]]{{sfn|Meri|2005|p=205}} that later gained a canonical status in [[Islamic jurisprudence]]. It specifies rights and restrictions for non-Muslims ([[dhimmis]]) living under Islamic rule. 

There are several versions of the pact, differing both in structure and stipulations.{{sfn|Abu-Munshar|2007|p=63}} While the pact is traditionally attributed to the second [[Rashidun]] [[Caliph]] [[Umar|Umar ibn Khattab]],{{sfn|Thomas|Roggema|2009|p=360}} other jurists and orientalists have doubted this attribution{{sfn|Abu-Munshar|2007|p=63}} with the treaty being attributed to 9th century [[Mujtahid]]s (Islamic scholars) or the [[Umayyad]] Caliph [[Umar II]]. This treaty should not be confused with [[Umar's Assurance| Umar's Assurance of safety to the people of Aelia]] (known as ''al-ʿUhda al-ʿUmariyya'', {{lang-ar|العهدة العمرية}}).

In general, the pact contains a list of rights and restrictions on non-Muslims ([[dhimmis]]). By abiding to them, non-Muslims are granted security of their persons, their families, and their possessions. Other rights and stipulations may also apply. According to [[Ibn Taymiyya]], one of the jurists who accepted the authenticity of the pact, the dhimmis have the right "to free themselves from the Covenant of 'Umar and claim equal status with the Muslims if they enlisted in the army of the state and fought alongside the Muslims in battle."&lt;ref name=Ipgrave&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Georgetown University Press| isbn = 1589017226| last = Ipgrave| first = Michael| title = Justice and Rights: Christian and Muslim Perspectives| year = 2009| page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and authenticity==
According to Abu-Munshar, the historical origin of the document may lie in an agreement made between the Muslim conquerors and the Christians of [[Al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] or [[Damascus]] which was later extended to [[Dhimmi]]s elsewhere.{{sfn|Roggema|2009|p=361}}  He further writes that, "The humiliating conditions enumerated in the so-called “Pact of Umar” are utterly foreign to the mentality, thoughts and practices of this caliph...The deficiencies [in the textual integrity] support the contention that Umar was not the originator of the document."&lt;ref&gt;Maher Abu-Munshar, ''Islamic Jerusalem And Its Christians: A History of Tolerance And Tensions'', pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some Western historians suggest that the document was based on [[Umar's Assurance]], a treaty concluded between [[Umar|Umar ibn Khattab]] and the [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Patriarch of Jerusalem]], [[Sophronius of Jerusalem|Sophronius]] following the [[Siege of Jerusalem (637)|capture of Jerusalem]] by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] (637),{{sfn|Meri|2005|p=205}} while others believe the document was either the work of 9th century [[Ijtihad|Mujtahids]] or was forged during the reign of the [[Umayyad]] Caliph [[Umar II]] (717-720),&lt;ref name=emon/&gt; with other clauses added later. Other scholars concluded that the document may have originated in immediate post-conquest milieu and was stylized by later historians.{{sfn|Roggema|2009|p=361}}

Western scholars' opinions varied about the Pact's authenticity. According to Anver M. Emon, "There is intense discussion in the secondary literature" about the Pact's authenticity, With scholars disagreeing on whether it might have originated during the reign of Umar b. al-Khattab or was "a later invention retroactively associated with Umar -- the caliph who famously led the initial imperial expansion -- to endow the contract of dhimma with greater normative weight?"&lt;ref name=emon&gt;{{cite book|last1=Emon|first1=Anver M.|title=Religious Pluralism and Islamic Law: Dhimmis and Others in the Empire of Law|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=71|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7MDyXu6bacC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=pact+of+umar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KnODVZXSK8u1-QHvp4H4Bg&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=pact%20of%20umar&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A.S. Tritton is one scholar who has "suggested that the Pact is a fabrication" because later Muslim conquerors did not apply its terms to their agreements with their non-Muslim subjects, which they would have if the pact had existed earlier. on the other hand Another scholar  Daniel C. Dennet  believes that the Pact was "no different from any other treaty negotiated in that period and that it is well within reason that the Pact we have today , as preserved in al-Tabari's chronicle is an authentic version of that early treaty."&lt;ref name=emon/&gt; Historian Abraham P. Bloch writes that, "Omar was a tolerant ruler, unlikely to impose humiliating conditions upon non-Muslims, or to infringe upon their religious and social freedoms.  His name has been erroneously associated…with the restrictive Covenant of Omar."&lt;ref&gt;Abraham P. Bloch, ''One a Day: An Anthology of Jewish Historical Anniversaries for Every Day of the Year'', p. 314. {{ISBN|0881251089}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Thomas Walker Arnold]], the pact "is in harmony" with Umar's "kindly consideration for his subjects of another faith,&lt;ref name="ArnoldPoI3"&gt;{{cite book

The book ''Classical Islam: a Sourcebook of Religious Literature'', quotes a version of the Pact from ''[[Kitab al-Umm]]'' of [[al-Shafi'i]] (d.204/820) that it says may be "a forerunner to the later document which gained something of a canonical status, making it applicable in many locations ..."&lt;ref name=CIS-138&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Calder|editor1-first=Norman|editor2-last=Mojaddedi,|editor2-first=Jawid|editor3-last=Rippin|editor3-first=Andrew|title=Classical Islam: A Sourcebook of Religious Literature|publisher=Routledge.|page=138|date=2003|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xgLslcH9U0IC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=pact+of+umar&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TIaDVb3ULOrLsAT1jJmICw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=pact%20of%20umar&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|epistemological break}}

A '''paradigm shift''', a concept identified by the American physicist and philosopher [[Thomas Kuhn]], is a fundamental change in the basic [[concept]]s and [[experiment]]al practices of a [[:Category:Scientific disciplines|scientific discipline]]. Kuhn contrasts paradigm shifts, which characterize a [[scientific revolution]], to the activity of [[normal science]], which he describes as scientific work done within a prevailing framework (or paradigm). In this context, the word "paradigm" is used in its original [[Greek language|Greek]] meaning, as "example".

The nature of scientific revolutions has been studied by [[Modern Philosophy|modern philosophy]] since [[Immanuel Kant]] used the phrase in the preface to the second edition of his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' (1787). Kant used the phrase "revolution of the way of thinking" ({{lang|de|Revolution der Denkart}}) to refer to [[Greek mathematics]] and [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]]. In the 20th century, new developments in the basic concepts of [[Foundations of mathematics#Foundational crisis|mathematics]], [[Theory of relativity|physics]], and [[Life#Biology|biology]] revitalized interest in the question among scholars.

Kuhn presented his notion of a paradigm shift in his influential book ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962). As one commentator summarizes:

{{quote|text=Kuhn acknowledges having used the term "paradigm" in two different meanings. In the first one, "paradigm" designates what the members of a certain scientific community have in common, that is to say, the whole of techniques, patents and values shared by the members of the community. In the second sense, the paradigm is a single element of a whole, say for instance Newton’s Principia, which, acting as a common model or an example... stands for the explicit rules and thus defines a coherent tradition of investigation. Thus the question is for Kuhn to investigate by means of the paradigm what makes possible the constitution of what he calls "normal science". That is to say, the science which can decide if a certain problem will be considered scientific or not. Normal science does not mean at all a science guided by a coherent system of rules, on the contrary, the rules can be derived from the paradigms, but the paradigms can guide the investigation also in the absence of rules. This is precisely the second meaning of the term "paradigm", which Kuhn considered the most new and profound, though it is in truth the oldest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maxvanmanen.com/files/2014/03/Agamben-What-is-a-paradigm1.pdf |author= Agamben, Giorgio |authorlink= Giorgio Agamben |title=What is a Paradigm? |accessdate=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Even though Kuhn restricted the use of the term to the natural sciences, the concept of a paradigm shift has also been used in numerous non-scientific contexts to describe a profound change in a fundamental model or perception of events.

== Kuhnian paradigm shifts ==
[[File:Duck-Rabbit illusion.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Kuhn used the [[Rabbit–duck illusion|duck-rabbit optical illusion]], made famous by [[Wittgenstein]], to demonstrate the way in which a paradigm shift could cause one to see the same information in an entirely different way.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;]]

An [[epistemology|epistemological]] paradigm shift  was called a "scientific revolution" by epistemologist and [[history of science|historian of science]] Thomas Kuhn in his book ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''.

A scientific revolution occurs, according to Kuhn, when scientists encounter anomalies that cannot be explained by the universally accepted paradigm within which scientific progress has thereto been made. The paradigm, in Kuhn's view, is not simply the current theory, but the entire [[World view|worldview]] in which it exists, and all of the implications which come with it. This is based on features of landscape of knowledge that scientists can identify around them.

There are anomalies for all paradigms, Kuhn maintained, that are brushed away as acceptable levels of error, or simply ignored and not dealt with (a principal argument Kuhn uses to reject [[Karl Popper]]'s model of [[falsifiability]] as the key force involved in scientific change). Rather, according to Kuhn, anomalies have various levels of significance to the practitioners of science at the time. To put it in the context of early 20th century physics, some scientists found the problems with calculating [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|Mercury's perihelion]] more troubling than the [[Michelson-Morley experiment]] results, and some the other way around. Kuhn's model of scientific change differs here, and in many places, from that of the [[logical positivists]] in that it puts an enhanced emphasis on the individual humans involved as scientists, rather than abstracting science into a purely logical or philosophical venture.

When enough significant anomalies have accrued against a current paradigm, the scientific discipline is thrown into a state of ''crisis,'' according to Kuhn. During this crisis, new ideas, perhaps ones previously discarded, are tried. Eventually a ''new'' paradigm is formed, which gains its own new followers, and an intellectual "battle" takes place between the followers of the new paradigm and the hold-outs of the old paradigm. Again, for early 20th century physics, the transition between the [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwellian]] [[Maxwell's equations|electromagnetic worldview]] and the [[Albert Einstein|Einsteinian]] [[theory of relativity|relativistic]] worldview was neither instantaneous nor calm, and instead involved a protracted set of "attacks," both with empirical data as well as rhetorical or philosophical arguments, by both sides, with the Einsteinian theory winning out in the long run. Again, the weighing of evidence and importance of new data was fit through the human sieve: some scientists found the simplicity of Einstein's equations to be most compelling, while some found them more complicated than the notion of Maxwell's aether which they banished. Some found [[Arthur Eddington]]'s photographs of light bending around the sun to be compelling, while some questioned their accuracy and meaning. Sometimes the convincing force is just time itself and the human toll it takes, Kuhn said, using a quote from [[Max Planck]]: "a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1970 ed.): p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a given discipline has changed from one paradigm to another, this is called, in Kuhn's terminology, a ''scientific revolution'' or a ''paradigm shift''. It is often this final conclusion, the result of the long process, that is meant when the term ''paradigm shift'' is used colloquially: simply the (often radical) change of worldview, without reference to the specificities of Kuhn's historical argument.

In a 2015 retrospective on Kuhn,&lt;ref&gt;''Paradigm Shift: How Expert Opinions Keep Changing on Life, the Universe and Everything'', Imprint Academic 2015, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; the philosopher [[Martin Cohen (philosopher)|Martin Cohen]] describes the notion of the paradigm shift as a kind of intellectual virus – spreading from hard science to social science and on to the arts and even everyday political rhetoric today. Cohen claims that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy idea of what it might mean and, in line with the American philosopher of science, [[Paul Feyerabend]], accuses Kuhn of retreating from the more radical implications of his theory, which are that scientific facts are never really more than opinions, whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive.

== Science and paradigm shift ==

A common misinterpretation of paradigms is the belief that the discovery of paradigm shifts and the dynamic nature of science (with its many opportunities for subjective judgments by scientists) are a case for [[relativism]]:&lt;ref&gt;Sankey, Howard (1997) "Kuhn's ontological relativism," in ''Issues and Images in the Philosophy of Science: Scientific and Philosophical Essays in Honour of Azarya Polikarov'', edited by Dimitri Ginev and Robert S. Cohen. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic, 1997. Boston studies in the philosophy of science, vol. 192, pp. 305–20. {{ISBN|0792344448}}&lt;/ref&gt; the view that all kinds of belief systems are equal.  Kuhn vehemently denies this interpretation&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Kuhn, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (3rd ed.): p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; and states that when a scientific paradigm is replaced by a new one, albeit through a complex social process, the new one is ''always better'', not just different.

These claims of relativism are, however, tied to another claim that Kuhn does at least somewhat endorse: that the language and theories of different paradigms cannot be translated into one another or rationally evaluated against one another—that they are ''incommensurable''. This gave rise to much talk of different peoples and cultures having radically different worldviews or conceptual schemes—so different that whether or not one was better, they could not be understood by one another. However, the [[philosopher]] [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] published a highly regarded essay in 1974, "''On the Very Idea of a Conceptual Scheme''" (''Proceedings and Addresses of the American Philosophical Association'', Vol. 47, (1973–1974), pp.&amp;nbsp;5–20) arguing that the notion that any languages or theories could be incommensurable with one another was itself incoherent. If this is correct, Kuhn's claims must be taken in a weaker sense than they often are.  Furthermore, the hold of the Kuhnian analysis on [[social science]] has long been tenuous with the wide application of multi-paradigmatic approaches in order to understand complex human behaviour (see for example John Hassard, ''Sociology and Organization Theory: Positivism, Paradigm and Postmodernity''. Cambridge University Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0521350344}}.)

Paradigm shifts tend to be most dramatic in sciences that appear to be stable and mature, as in physics at the end of the 19th century. At that time, physics seemed to be a discipline filling in the last few details of a largely worked-out system. 

In ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', Kuhn wrote, "Successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science." (p.&amp;nbsp;12) Kuhn's idea was itself revolutionary in its time, as it caused a major change in the way that academics talk about science. Thus, it could be argued that it caused or was itself part of a "paradigm shift" in the history and sociology of science. However, Kuhn would not recognise such a paradigm shift. In the social sciences, people can still use earlier ideas to discuss the history of science.

Philosophers and historians of science, including Kuhn himself, ultimately accepted a modified version of Kuhn's model, which synthesizes his original view with the gradualist model that preceded it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} {{See also|Science and Theosophy#New paradigm}}

== Examples of paradigm shifts ==

=== Natural sciences ===
Some of the "classical cases" of Kuhnian paradigm shifts in science are:

* 1543 – The transition in [[cosmology]] from a [[Geocentric model|Ptolemaic cosmology]] to a [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican]] one.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 154 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1543 – The acceptance of the work of [[Andreas Vesalius]], whose work ''[[De humani corporis fabrica]]'' corrected the numerous errors in the previously-held system created by [[Galen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=[Vesalius and De humani corporis fabrica: Galen's errors and the change of anatomy in the sixteenth century] | pmid=11625189 | journal=Hippokrates (Helsinki) | pages=98–112 | last1 = Joutsivuo | first1 = T| year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1687 – The transition in [[mechanics]] from [[Aristotelian mechanics]] to [[classical mechanics]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 148 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1783 – The acceptance of [[Lavoisier]]'s theory of chemical reactions and combustion in place of [[phlogiston theory]], known as the [[chemical revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Paradigm Shifts: Technology &amp; Culture&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;
* The transition in [[optics]] from [[geometrical optics]] to [[physical optics]] with [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]]'s wave theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1826 – The discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Trudeau|first1=Richard J|title=The non-Euclidean revolution|date=1987|publisher=Birkhäuser|location=Boston|isbn=978-0-8176-3311-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1859 – The revolution in [[evolution]] from goal-directed change to [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[natural selection]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 151 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1880 - The [[germ theory of disease]] began overtaking Galen's [[miasma theory]].
* 1905 – The development of [[quantum mechanics]], which replaced [[classical mechanics]] at microscopic scales.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, pp. 83–84, 151 and passim&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1887 to 1905 – The transition from the [[luminiferous aether]] present in [[space]] to [[electromagnetic radiation]] in [[spacetime]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, 1970, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;
* 1919 – The transition between the worldview of [[Newtonian gravity]] and the [[Albert Einstein|Einsteinian]] [[General Relativity]].

=== Social sciences ===
In Kuhn's view, the existence of a single reigning paradigm is characteristic of the natural sciences, while philosophy and much of social science were characterized by a "tradition of claims, counterclaims, and debates over fundamentals."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Kuhn | first= Thomas N. |authorlink= Thomas Kuhn |editor1-last= Lakatos |editor1-first= Imre |editor2-last= Musgrave |editor2-first= Alan |editor1-link= Imre Lakatos |editor2-link= Alan Musgrave |title= Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge |edition= second |origyear= 1970 |year= 1972 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-521-09623-2 |page= 6 |chapter= Logic of Discovery or Psychology of Research |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

* The movement known as the [[cognitive revolution]] moved away from [[Behaviorism|behaviourist]] approaches to [[Psychology|psychological]] study and the acceptance of [[cognition]] as central to studying human behaviour.
* The [[Keynesian revolution]] is typically viewed as a major shift in [[macroeconomics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Laidler]]. ''Fabricating the Keynesian Revolution''.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], [[Say's Law]] dominated economic thought prior to Keynes for over a century, and the shift to Keynesianism was difficult. Economists who contradicted the law, which implied that underemployment and underinvestment (coupled with oversaving) were virtually impossible, risked losing their careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Galbraith |first=John Kenneth |year=1975 |title=Money: Whence It Came, Where It Went |page=223 |location=Boston |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=978-0-395-19843-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wzdkAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA223 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his magnum opus, Keynes cited one of his predecessors, [[John A. Hobson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keynes |first=John Maynard |title=The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money |page=366 |quote=Mr. Hobson has flung himself with unflagging, but almost unavailing, ardour and courage against the ranks of orthodoxy. Though it is so completely forgotten to-day, the publication of this book marks, in a sense, an epoch in economic thought. }}&lt;/ref&gt; who was repeatedly denied positions at universities for his heretical theory.
* Later, the movement for [[monetarism]] over [[Keynesian]]ism marked a second divisive shift. Monetarists held that fiscal policy was not effective for stabilizing [[inflation]], that it was solely a monetary phenomenon, in contrast to the [[Keynesian]] view of the time was that both fiscal and monetary policy were important.  Keynesians later adopted much of the monetarists' view of the [[quantity theory of money]] and shifting [[Phillips curve]], theories they initially rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, Michael D., Schwartz, Anna J.

The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis ''Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* First proposed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] in 1879, the [[laryngeal theory]] in [[Indo-European linguistics]] postulated the existence of "laryngeal" consonants in the [[Proto-Indo-European language]] (PIE), a theory that was confirmed by the discovery of the [[Hittite language]] in the early 20th century. The theory has since been accepted by the vast majority of linguists, paving the way for the [[internal reconstruction]] of the syntax and grammatical rules of PIE and is considered one of the most significant developments in linguistics since the initial discovery of the [[Indo-European language family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indo European Linguistics: An Introduction|author=James Clackson|publisher=[[Cambridge University]]|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Applied sciences ===
More recently, paradigm shifts are also recognisable in applied sciences:
* In medicine, the transition from "clinical judgment" to [[evidence-based medicine]]
* In software engineering, the transition from the Rational Paradigm to the Empirical Paradigm &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ralph|first1=Paul|title=The two paradigms of software development research|journal=Science of Computer Programming|date=January 2018|volume=156|pages=68–89|doi=10.1016/j.scico.2018.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marketing ==
In the later part of the 1990s, 'paradigm shift' emerged as a [[buzzword]], popularized as [[marketing speak]] and appearing more frequently in print and publication.&lt;ref&gt;
Robert Fulford, Globe and Mail (June 5, 1999). http://www.robertfulford.com/Paradigm.html Retrieved on 2008-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book ''Mind The Gaffe'', author [[Larry Trask]] advises readers to refrain from using it, and to use caution when reading anything that contains the phrase.  It is referred to in several articles and books&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;[http://www.cnet.com/4520-11136_1-6275610-1.html Cnet.com's Top 10 Buzzwords]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Complete Idiot's Guide to A Smart Vocabulary"&gt;[http://www.mcfedries.com/vocabulary/intro.asp "The Complete Idiot's Guide to a Smart Vocabulary" pp. 142–43, author: Paul McFedries publisher: Alpha; 1st edition (May 7, 2001)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215012026/http://www.mcfedries.com/vocabulary/intro.asp |date=December 15, 2007 }} {{ISBN|978-0-02-863997-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; as abused and overused to the point of becoming meaningless.

== Other uses ==
The term "paradigm shift" has found uses in other contexts, representing the notion of a major change in a certain thought-pattern—a radical change in personal beliefs, complex systems or organizations, replacing the former way of thinking or organizing with a radically different way of thinking or organizing:
* M. L. Handa, a professor of sociology in education at O.I.S.E. [[University of Toronto]], Canada, developed the concept of a paradigm within the context of social sciences. He defines what he means by "paradigm" and introduces the idea of a "social paradigm". In addition, he identifies the basic component of any social paradigm. Like Kuhn, he addresses the issue of changing paradigms, the process popularly known as "paradigm shift". In this respect, he focuses on the social circumstances which precipitate such a shift. Relatedly, he addresses how that shift affects social institutions, including the institution of education.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}
* The concept has been developed for technology and economics in the identification of new techno-economic paradigms as changes in technological systems that have a major influence on the behaviour of the entire economy ([[Carlota Perez]]; earlier work only on technological paradigms by [[Giovanni Dosi]]). This concept is linked to [[Joseph Schumpeter]]'s idea of [[creative destruction]]. Examples include the move to mass production and the introduction of microelectronics.&lt;ref http://cje.oxfordjournals.org/content/33/4/779.full.pdf&gt;2009. "Technological revolutions and techno-economic paradigms", Cambridge Journal of Economics, Vol. 34, No.1, pp. 185–202&lt;/ref&gt;
* Two photographs of the Earth from space, "[[Earthrise]]" (1968) and "[[The Blue Marble]]" (1972), are thought to have helped to usher in the [[environmentalist]] movement which gained great prominence in the years immediately following distribution of those images.&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Christopher H. "Global Warming and the Problem of Policy Innovation: Lessons from the Early Environmental Movement". 2009. http://www.lclark.edu/org/envtl/objects/39-2_Schroeder.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Stewart Brand#NASA image of Earth]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hans Küng]] applies Thomas Kuhn's theory of paradigm change to the entire history of Christian thought and theology. He identifies six historical "macromodels": 1) the apocalyptic paradigm of primitive Christianity, 2) the Hellenistic paradigm of the patristic period, 3) the medieval Roman Catholic paradigm, 4) the Protestant (Reformation) paradigm, 5) the modern Enlightenment paradigm, and 6) the emerging ecumenical paradigm. He also discusses five analogies between natural science and theology in relation to paradigm shifts. Küng addresses paradigm change in his books, Paradigm Change in Theology&lt;ref&gt;Kung, Hans &amp; Tracy, David (ed). ''Paradigm Change in Theology''. New York: Crossroad, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Theology for the Third Millennium: An Ecumenical View''.&lt;ref&gt;Küng, Hans. ''Theology for the Third Millennium: An Ecumenical View''. New York: Anchor Books, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''PetroSkills''' is a competency based training provider for the Oil and Gas Industry that offers training in disciplines that range from [[upstream (petroleum industry)|upstream]], [[downstream (petroleum industry)|downstream]], to [[occupational safety and health]].  PetroSkills was founded in 1963 and is based out of Tulsa, Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Company Overview of PetroSkills LLC|url=http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=31072180|publisher=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 PetroSkills began the [[PetroSkills Alliance]] by partnering with BP and Shell to involve large oil and gas companies directly into the design of course material, instructor review, and competency analysis.

In 2008 PetroSkills expanded their number of courses through the acquisition of PetrEX International, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PetroSkills Snags New Drilling Training, Consulting Company|url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=65040|publisher=RigZone|date=2008-08-04|accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 PetroSkills was acquired by BV Investment Partners. Previous owners, Ford Brett and Dennis Wing retained a minority ownership position during the acquisition. BV partner Justin Harrison was quoted as saying, "We share management's view that long-term demand drivers for oil and gas resources, the increasing technological complexity of finding and extracting oil and gas, and a demographic shift in the industry's workforce composition will drive a growing and sustainable need for quality technical training and competency-based solutions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marino |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.themiddlemarket.com/news/bv-investment-partners-petroskills-211433-1.html |title=Mergers &amp; Acquisitions |publisher=Themiddlemarket.com |date=2010-09-29 |accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Also in 2010 PetroSkills partnered with the [[Southern Alberta Institute of Technology]] and began providing training to operations and maintenance technicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petrocomputing.wordpress.com/2010/03/31/petroskills-announces-new-om-jv/ |title=PetroSkills Announces New O&amp;M JV " PetroComputing |publisher=Petrocomputing.wordpress.com |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This partnership was a "response to the bigger crew change that will be occurring across operator ranks over the next decade. The demographic changes impacting the engineering ranks within E&amp;P represent a small percentage of the numbers that will be impacted in the operations and maintenance ranks.” With the introduction of PetroSkills O&amp;M, a specific focus was placed on both operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) technicians employed in upstream, midstream and downstream roles, PetroSkills O&amp;M offers companies training through both instructor-led training and e-learning content.

In 2011 PetroSkills opened its own 325,000 square foot Conference Center on January 14.  The center is located in Katy, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.katyconfidential.com/2011/08/petroskills/ |title=PetroSkills Conference Center |publisher=Katy Confidential |date=2011-08-11 |accessdate=2012-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011 PetroSkills launched PetroCore, a browser-based application offering technical professionals in the oil and gas industry anytime, online access to PetroSkills course materials and other technical knowledge resources.

In 2012 PetroSkills opened a training facility in Bahrain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alwasatnews.com/3496/news/read/647737/1.html |title=Minister of Energy Opens Regional Office for PetroSkills |publisher=Al Wasat News |date=2012-04-03 |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2012, PetroSkills announced that it acquired John M. Campbell &amp; Co., a training provider that's focus was heavily on the facilities side of the Oil and Gas industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/oil_gas/a/122508/PetroSkills_Acquires_Training_Consulting_Businesses |title=PetroSkills Acquires Training, Consulting Businesses |publisher=RigZone |date=2012-12-03 |accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''phenome''' is the set of all [[phenotype]]s expressed by a [[cell (biology)|cell]], [[biological tissue|tissue]], [[organ (anatomy)|organ]], [[organism]], or [[species]].

Just as the [[genome]] and [[proteome]] signify all of an organism's genes and proteins, the phenome represents the sum total of its phenotypic traits. Examples of human phenotypic traits are [[skin color]], [[eye color]], [[body height]], or specific [[Personality type|personality]] characteristics.{{Dubious|date=September 2016}} Although any phenotype of any organism has a basis in its genotype, phenotypic expression may be influenced by environmental influences, mutation, and genetic variation such as [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs), or a combination of these factors.

[[Phenomics]] is the study of the phenome and how it is determined, particularly when studied in relation to the set of all genes ([[genomics]]) or all proteins ([[proteomics]]).

== Origin and usage ==

The term was first used by Davis in 1949, "We here propose the name ''phenome'' for the sum total of extragenic, non-autoreproductive portions of the cell, whether cytoplasmic or nuclear.  The phenome would be the material basis of the phenotype, just as the genome is the material basis of the genotype."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Davis BD |title=The Isolation of Biochemically Deficient Mutants of Bacteria by Means of Penicillin |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=1–10 |date=January 1949 |pmid=16588845 |pmc=1062948 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.35.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although phenome has been in use for many years, the distinction between the use of phenome and phenotype is problematical. A proposed definition for both terms as the "physical totality of all traits of an organism or of one of its subsystems" was put forth by Mahner and Kary in 1997, who argue that although scientists tend to intuitively use these and related terms in a manner that does not impede research, the terms are not well defined and usage of the terms is not consistent.&lt;ref name="JTB1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Loeffler M, Bratke T, Paulus U, Li YQ, Potten CS |title=Clonality and life cycles of intestinal crypts explained by a state dependent stochastic model of epithelial stem cell organization |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology]] |volume=186 |issue=1 |pages=41–54 |date=May 1997 |pmid=9176636 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.1996.0340 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022-5193(96)90340-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some usages of the term suggest that the phenome of a given organism is best understood as a kind of matrix of data representing physical manifestation of phenotype. For example, discussions led by A.Varki among those who had used the term up to 2003 suggested the following definition: “The body of information describing an organism's phenotypes, under the influences of genetic and environmental factors”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Varki A, Altheide TK |title=Comparing the human and chimpanzee genomes: searching for needles in a haystack |journal=[[Genome Research]] |volume=15 |issue=12 |pages=1746–58 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16339373 |doi=10.1101/gr.3737405 |url=http://www.genome.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16339373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another team of researchers characterize "the human phenome &lt;nowiki&gt;[as]&lt;/nowiki&gt; a multidimensional search space with several neurobiological levels, spanning the proteome, cellular systems (e.g., signaling pathways), neural systems and cognitive and behavioural phenotypes."&lt;ref name="Neuroscience1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Siebner HR, Callicott JH, Sommer T, Mattay VS |title=From the genome to the phenome and back: linking genes with human brain function and structure using genetically informed neuroimaging |journal=[[Neuroscience (journal)|Neuroscience]] |volume=164 |issue=1 |pages=1–6 |date=November 2009 |pmid=19751805 |doi=10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.09.009 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306-4522(09)01484-5 |pmc=3013363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17393">[[File:Position angle.svg|thumb|250px|An illustration of how position angle is estimated through a telescope eyepiece; the primary star is at center.]]
'''Position angle''', usually abbreviated '''PA''', is the convention for measuring angles on the sky  in astronomy. The [[International Astronomical Union]] defines it as the angle measured relative to the [[Celestial pole|north celestial pole]] (NCP), turning positive into the direction of the [[right ascension]]. In the standard (non-flipped) images this is a counterclockwise measure relative to the axis into the direction of positive [[declination]].

In the case of  observed [[Visual binary|visual binary stars]], it is defined as the angular offset of the secondary star from the primary relative to the [[Celestial pole|north celestial pole]].

As the example illustrates, if one were observing a hypothetical binary star with a PA of 135 degrees, that means an imaginary line in the eyepiece drawn from the north celestial pole to the primary (P) would be offset from the secondary (S) such that the NCP-P-S angle would be 135 degrees.

When graphing visual binary orbits, the NCP line is traditionally drawn downward—that is, with north at bottom—and PA is measured counterclockwise.

Also the direction of the [[proper motion]] can for example be given by its position angle.

The definition of position angle is also applied to extended objects like galaxies, where it refers to the angle made by the major axis of the object with the NCP line.

==Nautics==
The concept of the position angle is inherited from nautical navigation on the oceans, where the optimum [[compass]] course is the course from a known position {{math|'''s'''}} to a target position {{math|'''t'''}} with minimum effort. Setting aside the influence of winds and ocean currents, the optimum course is the course of smallest distance between the two positions on the ocean surface. Computing the compass course is known as the ''inverse problem'' of [[Geodesics on an ellipsoid|geodesics]].

This article considers only the abstraction of minimizing the distance between {{math|'''s'''}} and {{math|'''t'''}} traveling on the surface of a sphere with some radius {{math|R}}. In which direction angle {{math|p}} relative to North should the ship steer to reach the target position?

===Global geocentric coordinate system===
[[File:PositionAngle.svg|thumb|400px|The position angle of the point '''t''' at the point '''s''' is the angle at which the green and the dashed great circles intersect at '''s'''. The unit directions {{math|u&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|u&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the rotation axis {{math|&amp;omega;}} are marked by arrows.]]
Detailed evaluation of the optimum direction is possible if the sea surface is approximated by a sphere surface. The standard computation places the ship at a geodetic [[latitude]] {{math|φ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}} and geodetic [[longitude]] {{math|λ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where {{math|φ}} is considered positive if north of the equator, and where {{math|λ}} is considered positive if east of [[Prime meridian|Greenwich]]. In the global coordinate system centered at the center of the sphere, the Cartesian components are

::&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf s}=R\left(\begin{array}{c} \cos\varphi_s \cos\lambda_s \\
\cos\varphi_s \sin\lambda_s \\
\sin\varphi_s
\end{array}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
and the target position is

::&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf t}=R\left(\begin{array}{c} \cos\varphi_t \cos\lambda_t \\
\cos\varphi_t \sin\lambda_t \\
\sin\varphi_t
\end{array}\right). &lt;/math&gt;
The North Pole is at
::&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf N}=R\left(\begin{array}{c} 0 \\
0 \\
1
\end{array}\right). &lt;/math&gt;
The [[Great-circle distance|minimum distance]] {{math|d}} is the distance along a great circle that runs through {{math|'''s'''}} and {{math|'''t'''}}. It is calculated in a plane that contains the sphere center and the [[great circle]],
::&lt;math&gt; d_{s,t}=R\theta_{s,t}&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|θ}} is the angular distance of two points viewed from the center of the sphere, measured in [[radian]]s. The cosine of the angle is calculated by the [[dot product]]  of the two vectors
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}\cdot \mathbf{t} = R^2\cos \theta_{s,t} = R^2(\sin\varphi_s\sin\varphi_t+\cos\varphi_s\cos\varphi_t\cos(\lambda_t-\lambda_s))&lt;/math&gt;
If the ship steers straight to the North Pole, the travel distance is
::&lt;math&gt;d_{s,N} = R\theta_{s,N} = R(\pi/2-\varphi_s)&lt;/math&gt;
If a ship starts at {{math|'''t'''}} and swims straight to the North Pole, the travel distance is
::&lt;math&gt;d_{t,N} = R\theta_{t,n} =R(\pi/2-\varphi_t)&lt;/math&gt;

===Brief Derivation===
The ''cosine formula'' of [[spherical trigonometry]] &lt;ref name=AS&gt;&lt;cite&gt; {{AS ref|4.3.149}}&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; yields for the 
angle {{math|p}} between the great circles through {{math|'''s'''}} that point to the North on one hand and to {{math|'''t'''}} on the other hand
::&lt;math&gt;\cos\theta_{t,N} = \cos\theta_{s,t}\cos\theta_{s,N}+\sin\theta_{s,t}\sin\theta_{s,N}\cos p.&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\sin\varphi_t = \cos\theta_{s,t}\sin\varphi_s +\sin\theta_{s,t}\cos\varphi_s\cos p.&lt;/math&gt;
The ''sine formula'' yields
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin p}{\sin \theta_{t,N}} = \frac{\sin(\lambda_t-\lambda_s)}{\sin\theta_{s,t}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Solving this for {{math|sin θ&lt;sub&gt;s,t&lt;/sub&gt;}} and insertion in the previous formula gives an expression for the tangent of the position angle,
::&lt;math&gt;\sin\varphi_t = \cos\theta_{s,t}\sin\varphi_s +\frac{\sin(\lambda_t-\lambda_s)}{\sin p}\cos\varphi_t\cos\varphi_s\cos p;&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\tan p = \frac{\sin(\lambda_t-\lambda_s)\cos\varphi_t\cos\varphi_s}{\sin\varphi_t-\cos\theta_{s,t}\sin\varphi_s}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Long Derivation===
Because the brief derivation gives an angle between 0 and {{math|π}} which does not reveal the sign (west or east of north ?), a more explicit derivation is desirable which yields separately the sine and the cosine of {{math|p}} such that use of the [[Atan2|correct branch of the inverse tangent]] allows to produce an angle in the full range {{math|-π≤p≤π}}.

The computation starts from a construction of the great circle between {{math|'''s'''}} and {{math|'''t'''}}. It lies in the plane that contains the sphere center, {{math|'''s'''}} and {{math|'''t'''}} and is constructed rotating {{math|'''s'''}} by the angle {{math|θ&lt;sub&gt;s,t&lt;/sub&gt;}} around an axis {{math|ω}}. The axis is perpendicular to the plane of the great circle and computed by the normalized vector [[cross product]] of the two positions:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\omega} = \frac{1}{R^2\sin \theta_{s,t}}\mathbf{s}\times \mathbf{t} 
= \frac{1}{\sin \theta_{s,t}}\left(\begin{array}{c}
\cos\varphi_s\sin\lambda_s\sin\varphi_t -\sin\varphi_s\cos\varphi_t\sin\lambda_t
\\
\sin\varphi_s\cos\lambda_t\cos\varphi_t -\cos\varphi_s\sin\varphi_t\cos\lambda_s
\\
\cos\varphi_s\cos\varphi_t\sin(\lambda_t-\lambda_s)
\end{array}\right).
&lt;/math&gt;
A right-handed tilted coordinate system with the center at the center of the sphere is given by the
following three axes: the
axis {{math|'''s'''}}, the axis
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}_\perp = \omega \times \frac{1}{R}\mathbf{s} =
\frac{1}{\sin\theta_{s,t}}
\left(\begin{array}{c}
\cos\varphi_t\cos\lambda_t(\sin^2\varphi_s+\cos^2\varphi_s\sin^2\lambda_s)-\cos\lambda_s(\sin\varphi_s\cos\varphi_s\sin\varphi_t+\cos^2\varphi_s\sin\lambda_s\cos\varphi_t\sin\lambda_t)\\
\cos\varphi_t\sin\lambda_t(\sin^2\varphi_s+\cos^2\varphi_s\cos^2\lambda_s)-\sin\lambda_s(\sin\varphi_s\cos\varphi_s\sin\varphi_t+\cos^2\varphi_s\cos\lambda_s\cos\varphi_t\cos\lambda_t)\\
\cos\varphi_s[\cos\varphi_s\sin\varphi_t-\sin\varphi_s\cos\varphi_t\cos(\lambda_t-\lambda_s)]
\end{array}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;
and the axis {{math|ω}}.
A position along the great circle is
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}(\theta) = \cos\theta \mathbf{s}+\sin\theta \mathbf{s}_\perp,\quad 0\le\theta\le 2\pi.&lt;/math&gt;
The compass direction is given by inserting the two vectors {{math|'''s'''}} and {{math|'''s'''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;perp;&lt;/sub&gt;}} and computing the gradient of the vector with respect to {{math|θ}} at {{math|θ{{=}}0}}.
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}\mathbf{s}_{\mid \theta=0}=\mathbf{s}_\perp.&lt;/math&gt;
The angle {{math|p}} is given by splitting this direction along two orthogonal directions in the plane tangential to the sphere at the point {{math|'''s'''}}. The two directions are given by the partial derivatives of {{math|'''s'''}} with respect to {{math|&amp;phi;}} and with respect to {{math|&amp;lambda;}}, normalized to unit length:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_N = \left(
\begin{array}{c}
-\sin\varphi_s\cos\lambda_s\\
-\sin\varphi_s\sin\lambda_s\\
\cos\varphi_s
\end{array}\right);&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_E = \left(\begin{array}{c}
-\sin\lambda_s\\
\cos\lambda_s\\
0
\end{array}
\right);&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_N\cdot \mathbf{s} = \mathbf{u}_E\cdot \mathbf{u}_N =0 &lt;/math&gt;
{{math|'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;}} points north and {{math|'''u'''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;}} points east at the position {{math|'''s'''}}.
The position angle {{math|p}} projects {{math|'''s'''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;perp;&lt;/sub&gt;}}
into these two directions,
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s}_\perp = \cos p \,\mathbf{u}_N+\sin p\, \mathbf{u}_E&lt;/math&gt;,
where the positive sign means the positive position angles are defined to be north over east. The values of the cosine and sine of {{math|p}} are computed by multiplying this equation on both sides with the two unit vectors,
::&lt;math&gt;\cos p = \mathbf{s}_\perp \cdot \mathbf{u}_N
=\frac{1}{\sin\theta_{s,t}}[\cos\varphi_s\sin\varphi_t - \sin\varphi_s\cos\varphi_t\cos(\lambda_t-\lambda_s)];
&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\sin p = \mathbf{s}_\perp \cdot \mathbf{u}_E
=\frac{1}{\sin\theta_{s,t}}[\cos\varphi_t\sin(\lambda_t-\lambda_s)].
&lt;/math&gt;
Instead of inserting the convoluted expression of {{math|'''s'''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;perp;&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the evaluation may employ that the [[Triple product#Scalar triple product|triple product]] is invariant under a circular shift
of the arguments:
::&lt;math&gt;\cos p = (\mathbf{\omega}\times \frac{1}{R}\mathbf{s})\cdot \mathbf{u}_N
= \omega\cdot(\frac{1}{R}\mathbf{s}\times \mathbf{u}_N).&lt;/math&gt;

If [[atan2]] is used to compute the value, one can reduce both expressions by division through {{math|cos &amp;phi;&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;}}
and multiplication by {{math|sin &amp;theta;&lt;sub&gt;s,t&lt;/sub&gt;}},
because these values are always positive and that operation does not change signs; then effectively
::&lt;math&gt;\tan p = \frac{\sin(\lambda_t-\lambda_s)}{\cos\varphi_s\tan\varphi_t -\sin\varphi_s\cos(\lambda_t-\lambda_s)}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Astronomy==
The [[parallactic angle]] of [[Spherical astronomy|astronomy]] is the position angle of the [[zenith]] (considered the target position) as seen from the star (considered the starting position), where the [[Celestial pole|North Celestial Pole]] (NCP) of the celestial sphere defines the reference direction.
The sign of the angle is basically kept, north over east in both cases,
but as astronomers look at stars from the inside of the celestial sphere, 
the definition uses the convention that the {{math|q}} is the angle in an image that turns the direction to the NCP [[clockwise|counterclockwise]] into the direction of the zenith.

===Brief Derivation===
The formulas are special cases of the formulas shown above. In the [[Celestial coordinate system|equatorial system]] of right ascension {{math|α}} and declination {{math|δ}} of a star
one considers the spherical triangle with an angle {{math|q}} at the position of the star,
with an angle {{math|h}}, the hour angle, at the NCP, and with an angle {{math|&amp;pi;-A}} at the
zenith, where {{math|A}} is the azimuth in the [[Celestial coordinate system#Converting coordinates|south-over-west convention]]. The side lengths of the spherical triangle are (i) {{math|&amp;pi;/2-&amp;phi;}} as the distance from the zenith to the NCP, where {{math|&amp;phi;}} is the observer's geographic latitude, (ii) {{math|&amp;pi;/2-&amp;delta;}} as the distance between the star and the NCP, and  (iii) {{math|z{{=}}&amp;pi;/2-a}}, the zenith distance, complement to the star elevation, as the distance between the zenith and the star.

The cosine formula (one of the three cosine formulas) is
::&lt;math&gt;\cos(\pi/2-\varphi) = \cos(\pi/2-\delta)\cos z + \sin(\pi/2-\delta)\sin z \cos q.&lt;/math&gt;
The sine formula is
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sin |q|}{\sin(\pi/2-\varphi)}=\frac{\sin |h|}{\sin z}=\frac{\sin(\pi-A)}{\sin(\pi/2-\delta)}.&lt;/math&gt;
The 4-parts formula is
::&lt;math&gt;\cos q = -\cos h \cos(\pi-A) + \sin |h| \sin(\pi-A) \cos (\pi/2-\varphi).&lt;/math&gt;
As in the brief derivation above, these formulas hide the sign of {{math|q}} and {{math|h}}, which
we indicated by placing the absolute values in arguments of the sines, which are sign-dependent.

===Long Derivation===
The explicit vector algebra to recover the correct sign is equivalent to the calculation of the 
long derivation for the compass course. In the global equatorial system the star is at
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{s} = \left(\begin{array}{c} \cos\delta \cos \alpha \\
\cos \delta\sin\alpha\\
\sin\delta\end{array}
\right).&lt;/math&gt;
In the same coordinate system the zenith is found by inserting {{math|a{{=}}&amp;pi;/2}}, {{math|cos a{{=}}0}}
into the [[Celestial coordinate system#Converting coordinates|transformation formulas]]
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{z} = \left(\begin{array}{c} \cos\varphi \cos l\\
\cos\varphi \sin l\\
\sin\varphi\end{array}
\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|&amp;phi;}} is the observer's geographic latitude, {{math|a}} the star's altitude,
{{math|z{{=}}&amp;pi;/2-a}} the zenith distance, and {{math|l}} the local sidereal time. The North Celestial Pole is at
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N} = \left(\begin{array}{c}0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{array}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
The normalized cross product is the rotation axis that turns the star into the direction of the zenith:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\omega}_z = \frac{1}{\sin z}\mathbf{s}\times \mathbf{z}
= \frac{1}{\sin z}\left(\begin{array}{c} \cos\delta\sin\alpha\sin\varphi -\sin\delta\cos\varphi\sin l\\
-\cos\delta\cos\alpha\sin\varphi +\sin\delta \cos\varphi\cos l\\
\cos\delta \cos\varphi \sin(\alpha-l) \end{array}
\right).&lt;/math&gt;
Finally {{math|&amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; X '''s'''}} is the third axis of the tilted coordinate system and the direction into which the star is moved on the great circle towards the zenith.

The plane tangential to the celestial sphere at the star is spanned by the unit vectors to the north,
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_\delta = \left(\begin{array}{c} -\sin\delta\cos\alpha\\
-\sin\delta\sin\alpha\\
\cos\delta \end{array}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
and to the east
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_\alpha = \left(\begin{array}{c} -\sin\alpha \\
\cos\alpha\\
0 \end{array}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
These are orthogonal:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}_\delta \cdot \mathbf{u}_\alpha=0;\quad
\mathbf{u}^2_\delta = \mathbf{u}^2_\alpha=1.
&lt;/math&gt;
The parallactic angle {{math|q}} is the angle of the initial section of the great circle
at '''s''', east of north,
::&lt;math&gt;\omega_z\times \mathbf{s} = \cos q\, \mathbf{u}_\delta + \sin q \, \mathbf{u}_\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\cos q = (\omega_z\times \mathbf{s})\cdot \mathbf{u}_\delta =
\frac{1}{\sin z}(\cos\delta\sin\varphi -\sin\delta \cos\varphi \cos h),&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\sin q = (\omega_z\times \mathbf{s})\cdot \mathbf{u}_\alpha =
\frac{1}{\sin z}\sin h \cos\varphi.&lt;/math&gt;
The values of {{math|sin z}} and of {{math|cos &amp;phi;}} are positive, so using [[atan2]] functions one may
divide both expressions through these without losing signs; eventually
::&lt;math&gt;\tan q = \frac{\sin h\cos\varphi}{\cos\delta \sin\varphi -\sin\delta \cos\varphi \cos h}=
\frac{\sin h}{\cos\delta \tan\varphi-\sin\delta \cos h}&lt;/math&gt;
yields the angle in the full range {{math|-&amp;pi; &amp;le; q &amp;le; &amp;pi;}}. The advantage of this expression is that it 
does not depend on the various offset conventions of {{math|A}}; the uncontroversial offset
of the hour angle {{math|h}}
takes care of this.

For a sidereal target, by definition a target where {{math|&amp;delta;}} and {{math|&amp;alpha;}} are not time-dependent,
the angle changes with a period of a [[Sidereal time|sidereal day]] {{math|T&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;}}.
Let dots denote time derivatives; then the hour angle changes as
::&lt;math&gt;\dot h =\frac{2\pi}{T_s}&lt;/math&gt;
and the time derivative of the {{math|tan q}} expression is 
::&lt;math&gt;\dot q \frac{1}{\cos^2 q}= \frac{\cos\varphi[\cos h \cos\delta \sin\varphi-\sin\delta\cos\varphi]}{(\cos\delta \sin\varphi-\sin\delta \cos\varphi \cos h)^2} \dot h;&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\dot q 
= \frac{\cos \varphi[\cos h \cos\delta \sin \varphi -\sin \delta \cos\varphi]}{\sin ^2z}\dot h
= \frac{\cos \varphi \cos a \cos A}{\sin^2 z}\dot h
=\frac{\cos\varphi \cos A}{\sin z}\dot h.
&lt;/math&gt;

The [[world population]] is currently growing by approximately 83 million people each year.&lt;ref name="esa.un.org"/&gt; Growth rates are slowing to various extents within different populations with result of the overall [[population growth]] rate decreasing from 1.55% per year in 1995 to 1.25% in 2005, 1.18% in 2015 and 1.10% in 2017. The median estimate for future growth sees the world population reaching 8.6 billion in 2030, 9.8 billion in 2050 and 11.2 billion by 2100&lt;ref name="esa.un.org"/&gt; assuming a continuing decrease in average [[fertility rate]] from 2.5 births per woman in 2010–2015 to 2.2 in 2045–2050 and to 2.0 in 2095–2100, according to the medium-variant projection.&lt;ref name="esa.un.org"/&gt; With [[longevity]] trending towards uniform and stable values worldwide, the main driver of future population growth is the evolution of the fertility rate.&lt;ref name="UN-WPP-2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Publications/Files/WPP2017_KeyFindings.pdf|title=World Population Prospects: The 2016 Revision – Key Findings and Advance Tables|date=July 2016|publisher=[[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]], Population Division|access-date=26 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}}

While most scenarios still predict continued growth into the 22nd century, there is a roughly 27% chance that the total population could stabilize or begin to fall before 2100.&lt;ref name=UN-WPP-2015 /&gt;{{rp|3}} Longer-term speculative scenarios over the next two centuries can predict anything between runaway growth to radical decline (36.4 billion or 2.3 billion people in 2300), with the median projection showing a slight decrease followed by a stabilization around 9 billion people.&lt;ref name=un-esa1 /&gt;{{rp|13}}

By 2070, the bulk of the world's population growth is predicted to take place in Africa: of the additional 2.4 billion people projected between 2015 and 2050, 1.3 billion will be added in Africa, 0.9 billion in Asia and only 0.2 billion in the rest of the world. Africa's share of global population is projected to grow from 16% in 2015 to 25% in 2050 and 39% by 2100, while the share of Asia will fall from 60% in 2015 to 54% in 2050 and 44% in 2100.&lt;ref name=UN-WPP-2015 /&gt;{{rp|3}} The strong growth of the African population will happen regardless of the rate of decrease of fertility, because of the exceptional proportion of young people already living today. For example, the UN projects that the population of [[Nigeria]] will surpass that of the [[United States]] by 2050.&lt;ref name=UN-WPP-2015 /&gt;{{rp|4}} The population of the more developed regions is slated to remain mostly unchanged, at 1.2 billion, as international migrations from high-growth regions compensate the fertility deficit of richer countries.&lt;ref name=UN-WPP-2015 /&gt;{{rp|11}}

== Growth regions ==
[[File:Fertility rate world map 2.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Map of countries by fertility rate (2018), according to [[CIA World Factbook]]
]]

From 2017 to 2050, nine countries are (''in most country population is very low but based on growth'') expected to account for half of the world's projected population increase: [[India]], [[Nigeria]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Pakistan]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Tanzania]], the [[United States]], [[Uganda]], and [[Indonesia]], listed according to the expected size of their contribution to that projected population growth.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/development/desa/en/news/population/world-population-prospects-2017.html&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2010 to 2015, the average world fertility was 2.5 children per woman,&lt;ref name="esa.un.org"/&gt; about half the level in 1950–1955 (5 children per woman). In the medium variant, global fertility is projected to decline further to 2.2 in 2045 to 2050 and to 2.0 in 2095-2100.&lt;ref name="esa.un.org"/&gt;

Global life expectancy at birth, which is estimated to have risen from 46 years in 1950–1955 to 65 years in 2000–2005, is expected to keep rising to reach 75 years in 2045–2050. In the more developed regions, the projected increase is from 75 years today to 82 years by mid-century. Among the least developed countries, where life expectancy today is just under 50 years, it is expected to be 66 years in 2045–2050. The population of 31 countries or areas, including Ukraine, Romania, Japan and most of the [[former Soviet Union|successor states of the Soviet Union]], is expected to be lower in 2050 than in 2005.

=== Projected migration to developed countries ===
According to the United Nations, during 2005–2050 the net number of international migrants to more developed regions is projected to be 98 million. Because deaths are projected to exceed births in the more developed regions by 73 million during 2005–2050, population growth in those regions will largely be due to international migration. In 2000–2005, net migration in 28 countries either prevented [[population decline]] or doubled at least the contribution of natural increase (births minus deaths) to population growth. These countries include Austria, Canada, Croatia, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Portugal, Qatar, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="un.org-pop918"&gt;https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2005/pop918.doc.html {{Dead link|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2050 (medium variant), [[India]] will have 1.73 billion people, [[China]] 1.46 billion, [[Nigeria]] 411 million, [[United States]] 398 million, [[Indonesia]] 327 million, [[Pakistan]] 309 million, [[Bangladesh]] 265.8 million, [[Brazil]] 232 million, [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] 195.3 million, [[Ethiopia]] 188.5 million, [[Mexico]] 164 million, [[Philippines]] 157.1 million, [[Egypt]] 142 million, [[Russia]] 133 million, [[Tanzania]] 129.4 million, [[Vietnam]] 112.8 million, [[Japan]] 107 million, [[Uganda]] 101 million, [[Turkey]] 96 million, [[Kenya]] 95.5 million, [[Iran]] 93.5 million, [[Sudan]] 81 million, [[Germany]] 78 million and the [[United Kingdom]] and France 75 million.

[[Walter Greiling]] projected in the 1950s that world population would reach a peak of about nine billion, in the 21st century, and then stop growing after a readjustment of the [[Third World]] and a sanitation of the [[tropics]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Greiling]]: Wie werden wir leben? (''"How are we going to live?"'') Econ publishers, Munich 1954&lt;/ref&gt; 

Estimates published in the 2000s tended to predict that the population of Earth will stop increasing around 2070;&lt;ref&gt;Ciro Pabón y Ciro Pabón, Manual de Urbanismo, Editorial Leyer, Bogotá, 2007, {{ISBN|978-958-711-296-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a 2004 long-term prospective report, the [[United Nations Population Division]] projected the world population to peak at 9.22 billion in 2075.  After reaching this maximum, it would decline slightly and then resume a slow increase, reaching a level of 8.97 billion by 2300, about the same as the projected 2050 figure.&lt;ref name=un-esa1&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]], Population Division |url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf |title=World Population to 2300 |year=2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} 

This prediction was revised in the 2010s, to the effect that no maximum will likely be reached in the 21st century.&lt;ref name=UN-WPP-2015 /&gt; 
The main reason for the revision was that the ongoing rapid population growth [[demographics of Africa|in Africa]] had been underestimated.
A 2014 paper by demographers from several universities and the United Nations Population Division forecast that the world's population will reach about 10.9 billion in 2100 and continue growing thereafter.&lt;ref name = Science&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1257469| pmid = 25301627| title = World population stabilization unlikely this century| journal = Science| volume = 346| issue = 6206| pages = 234–7| publisher  = AAAS| date = September 14, 2014| url  = http://www.sciencemag.org/content/early/2014/09/17/science.1257469| issn  =  1095-9203| last1 = Gerland | first1 = P.| last2 = Raftery | first2 = A.

The UN as of 2017 predicts a decline of global population growth rate from +1.0% in 2020 to +0.5% in 2050 and to +0.1% in 2100.&lt;ref name="esa.un.org"/&gt;

[[Jørgen Randers]], one of the authors of the seminal 1972 long-term simulations in ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'', offered an alternative scenario in a 2012 book, arguing that traditional projections insufficiently take into account the downward impact of global urbanization on fertility. Randers' "most likely scenario" predicts a peak in the world population in the early 2040s at about 8.1 billion people, followed by decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Randers |first=Jørgen |author-link=Jørgen Randers |year=2012 |title=2052: A Global Forecast for the Next Forty Years |publisher=Chelsea Green Publishing |location=Vermont |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These projected growth patterns depend on assumptions about vital rates. Total fertility is assumed to continue to decline, at varying paces depending on circumstances in individual countries, to a below-replacement level of 1.85 children per woman by mid century. Countries already at this level or below, and other countries when they reach it, will eventually return to replacement over a period of a century and stay at replacement going forward.  All countries are projected to have reached replacement fertility by 2175.

Some of the authors of the 2004 UN report say that life expectancy is assumed to rise slowly and continuously. The projections in the report assume this with no upper limit, though at a slowing pace depending on circumstances in individual countries. By 2100, the report assumed life expectancy to be from 66 to 97 years, and by 2300 from 87 to 106 years, depending on the country. Based on that assumption, they said that rising life expectancy will produce small but continuing population growth by the end of the projections, ranging from 0.03 to 0.07 percent annually. The hypothetical feasibility (and wide availability) of [[life extension]] by technological means would further exacerbate the overpopulation problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Newmark | first1 = PA | last2 = Sánchez Alvarado | first2 = A | year = 2002 | title = Not your father's planarian: a classic model enters the era of functional genomics | url = | journal = Nat Rev Genet | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 210–219 | doi = 10.1038/nrg759 | pmid = 11972158 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bavestrello | first1 = Giorgio | last2 = Sommer | first2 = Christian | last3 = Sarà | first3 = Michele | year = 1992 | title = Bi-directional conversion in Turritopsis nutricula (Hydrozoa) | url = | journal = Scientia Marina | volume = 56 | issue = 2–3| pages = 137–140 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martínez | first1 = DE | year = 1998 | title = Mortality patterns suggest lack of senescence in hydra | url = | journal = Exp Gerontol | volume = 33 | issue = 3| pages = 217–225 | pmid = 9615920 | doi=10.1016/S0531-5565(97)00113-7}} In an essay within the 2004 U.N. report, Tim Dyson said: "A rapid increase in life expectancy, which would raise the population pyramids, seems within reach, since it responds to an old and powerful demand for longevity."&lt;/ref&gt;

==After 2050==
Projections for after 2050 have usually assumed that fertility rates will have declined by then and the population will be stable or will decrease. However, a study in 2014 found that fertility rates in Africa have leveled off at around 4.6 instead of continuing to decline, and that consequently world population may be as high as 12 billion by 2100. Reasons for the continuing high birth rate include better [[survival rate|survival]] rates with respect to HIV, and contraception shortage.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Andy Coghlan|title=Global population may boom well beyond the year 2050|journal=New Scientist|date=27 Sep 2014|page=11|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329882.800-global-population-may-boom-well-beyond-the-year-2050.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Patrick Gerland, Adrian Raftery|title=World population stabilization unlikely this century|journal=Science|date=18 Sep 2014|doi=10.1126/science.1257469|display-authors=etal|pmid=25301627|pmc=4230924|volume=346|pages=234–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, on the other hand, concludes that education of women will lead to low fertility rates even in Africa.&lt;ref name=NS/&gt; [[Evolutionary biology]] also suggests the [[demographic transition]] may reverse itself; in addition, recent evidence suggests birth rates may be rising in the 21st century in the developed world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19923200 Can we be sure the world's population will stop rising?], BBC News, 13 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Retromer is a heteropentameric complex which in humans is composed of a less defined membrane-associated sorting nexin dimer ([[SNX1]], [[SNX2]], [[SNX5]], [[SNX6]]), and a [[vacuolar]] protein sorting (Vps) trimer containing [[VPS26A|Vps26]], [[VPS29|Vps29]], [[VPS35|Vps35]]. Although the SNX dimer is required for the recruitment of retromer to the [[endosomal]] membrane, the cargo binding function of this complex is contributed by the core trimer through the binding of Vps35 subunit to various cargo molecules&lt;ref name="pmid15078902"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seaman MN | title = Cargo-selective endosomal sorting for retrieval to the Golgi requires retromer | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 165 | issue = 1 | pages = 111–22 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15078902 | pmc = 2172078 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.200312034 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  including [[cation-dependent mannose-6-phosphate receptor|M6PR]]&lt;ref name="pmid15078903"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Arighi CN, Hartnell LM, Aguilar RC, Haft CR, Bonifacino JS | title = Role of the mammalian retromer in sorting of the cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 165 | issue = 1 | pages = 123–33 | date = April 2004 | pmid = 15078903 | pmc = 2172094 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.200312055 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GPR177|wntless]]&lt;ref name="pmid18160348"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Belenkaya TY, Wu Y, Tang X, Zhou B, Cheng L, Sharma YV, Yan D, Selva EM, Lin X | title = The retromer complex influences Wnt secretion by recycling wntless from endosomes to the trans-Golgi network | journal = Developmental Cell | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 120–31 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18160348 | doi = 10.1016/j.devcel.2007.12.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sortilin 1|sortilin]].&lt;ref name="pmid18559255"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Canuel M, Korkidakis A, Konnyu K, Morales CR | title = Sortilin mediates the lysosomal targeting of cathepsins D and H | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 373 | issue = 2 | pages = 292–7 | date = August 2008 | pmid = 18559255 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.06.021 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early study on sorting of acid hydrolases such as carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) in S. cerevisiae mutants has led to the identification of retromer in mediating the retrograde trafficking of the pro-CPY receptor ([[SORCS1|Vps10]]) from the endosomes to the TGN.&lt;ref name="pmid9700157"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seaman MN, McCaffery JM, Emr SD | title = A membrane coat complex essential for endosome-to-Golgi retrograde transport in yeast | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 142 | issue = 3 | pages = 665–81 | date = August 1998 | pmid = 9700157 | pmc = 2148169 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.142.3.665 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Retromer protein complex.png|thumb|400px|Retromer protein complex]]

== Structure ==

The retromer complex is highly [[Conservation (genetics)|conserved]]: [[homology (biology)|homologs]] have been found in ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'', [[mouse]] and [[human]].  The retromer complex consists of 5 proteins in yeast: Vps35p, Vps26p, Vps29p, Vps17p, Vps5p.  The mammalian retromer consists of  [[VPS26A|Vps26]], [[VPS29|Vps29]], [[VPS35|Vps35]], [[SNX1]] and [[SNX2]], and possibly [[SNX5]] and [[SNX6]].&lt;ref name="pmid17148574"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wassmer T, Attar N, Bujny MV, Oakley J, Traer CJ, Cullen PJ | title = A loss-of-function screen reveals SNX5 and SNX6 as potential components of the mammalian retromer | journal = Journal of Cell Science | volume = 120 | issue = Pt 1 | pages = 45–54 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17148574 | doi = 10.1242/jcs.03302 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is proposed to act in two subcomplexes: (1) Cargo recognition complex that consist of Vps35, Vps29 and Vps26 (Vps trimer), and (2) SNX-BAR dimers which consist of SNX1 or SNX2 and SNX5 or SNX6 that facilitates endosomal membrane remodulation and curvature resulting in the formation of tubules/[[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]]s which transports cargo molecules to the trans-golgi network (TGN).

== Function ==

The retromer complex has been shown to mediate retrieval of various transmembrane receptors, such as the [[Insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor|cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor]], the functional mammalian counterpart of [[Vps10]], and the [[Wnt signaling pathway|Wnt]] receptor [[GPR177|Wntless]].&lt;ref name="pmid18194646"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eaton S | title = Retromer retrieves wntless | journal = Developmental Cell | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–6 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 18194646 | doi = 10.1016/j.devcel.2007.12.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Retromer is required for the recycling of [[Kexin|Kex2p]] and DPAP-A which also cycle between the ''trans''-Golgi network and a pre-vacuolar (yeast endosome equivalent) compartment in yeast.  It is also required for the recycling of the cell surface receptor CED-1, which is necessary for phagocytosis of apoptotic cells.&lt;ref name="pmid20133524"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen D, Xiao H, Zhang K, Wang B, Gao Z, Jian Y, Qi X, Sun J, Miao L, Yang C | title = Retromer is required for apoptotic cell clearance by phagocytic receptor recycling | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5970 | pages = 1261–4 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20133524 | doi = 10.1126/science.1184840 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retromer plays a central role in the retrieval of several different cargo proteins from the endosome to the ''trans''-Golgi network.  However, it is clear that there are other complexes and proteins that act in this retrieval process.  So far it is not clear whether other components that have been identified in the retrieval pathway act with retromer in the same pathway or are involved in alternative pathways. Recent studies have implicated retromer sorting defects in [[Alzheimer's disease]]&lt;ref name="pmid26482054"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sadigh-Eteghad S, Askari-Nejad MS, Mahmoudi J, Majdi A | title = Cargo trafficking in Alzheimer’s disease: the possible role of retromer | journal = Neurological Sciences | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 17–22 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26482054 | doi = 10.1007/s10072-015-2399-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18480253"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Muhammad A, Flores I, Zhang H, Yu R, Staniszewski A, Planel E, Herman M, Ho L, Kreber R, Honig LS, Ganetzky B, Duff K, Arancio O, Small SA | title = Retromer deficiency observed in Alzheimer's disease causes hippocampal dysfunction, neurodegeneration, and Abeta accumulation | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 105 | issue = 20 | pages = 7327–32 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18480253 | pmc = 2386077 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0802545105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and late-onset [[Parkinson disease]] &lt;ref name=""&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zimprich A, Benet-Pagès A, Struhal W, Graf E, Eck SH, Offman MN, Haubenberger D, Spielberger S, Schulte EC, Lichtner P, Rossle SC, Klopp N, Wolf E, Seppi K, Pirker W, Presslauer S, Mollenhauer B, Katzenschlager R, Foki T, Hotzy C, Reinthaler E, Harutyunyan A, Kralovics R, Peters A, Zimprich F, Brücke T, Poewe W, Auff E, Trenkwalder C, Rost B, Ransmayr G, Winkelmann J, Meitinger T, Strom TM | title = A mutation in VPS35, encoding a subunit of the retromer complex, causes late-onset Parkinson disease | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 89 | issue = 1 | pages = 168–75 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21763483 | pmc = 3135812 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.06.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retromer also seems to play a role in [[Hepatitis C Virus]] replication.&lt;ref name="pmid26298293"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yin P, Hong Z, Yang X, Chung RT, Zhang L | title = A role for retromer in hepatitis C virus replication | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 869–81 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26298293 | doi = 10.1007/s00018-015-2027-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retromer-mediated retrograde trafficking==
The association of the Vps35-Vps29-Vps26 complex to the cytosolic domains of cargo molecules endosomal membranes initiates the activation of retrograde trafficking and cargo capture.&lt;ref name="pmid11038177"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nothwehr SF, Ha SA, Bruinsma P | title = Sorting of yeast membrane proteins into an endosome-to-Golgi pathway involves direct interaction of their cytosolic domains with Vps35p | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 151 | issue = 2 | pages = 297–310 | date = October 2000 | pmid = 11038177 | pmc = 2192648 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.151.2.297 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nucleation complex was formed through the interaction of VPS complex with [[guanosine triphosphate|GTP]]-activated [[RAB7A|Rab7]]&lt;ref name="pmid18981234"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rojas R, van Vlijmen T, Mardones GA, Prabhu Y, Rojas AL, Mohammed S, Heck AJ, Raposo G, van der Sluijs P, Bonifacino JS | title = Regulation of retromer recruitment to endosomes by sequential action of Rab5 and Rab7 | journal = The Journal of Cell Biology | volume = 183 | issue = 3 | pages = 513–26 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 18981234 | pmc = 2575791 | doi = 10.1083/jcb.200804048 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[clathrin]], [[clathrin adaptor proteins|clathrin-adaptor]]s and various binding proteins.&lt;ref name="pmid21463457"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McGough IJ, Cullen PJ | title = Recent advances in retromer biology | journal = Traffic | volume = 12 | issue = 8 | pages = 963–71 | date = August 2011 | pmid = 21463457 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0854.2011.01201.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SNX-BAR dimer enters the nucleation complex via direct binding or lateral movement on endosomal surface. The increased level of Retromer SNX-BARs causes a conformational switch to a curvature-inducing mode which initiates membrane tubule formation.&lt;ref name="pmid17512409"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shimada A, Niwa H, Tsujita K, Suetsugu S, Nitta K, Hanawa-Suetsugu K, Akasaka R, Nishino Y, Toyama M, Chen L, Liu ZJ, Wang BC, Yamamoto M, Terada T, Miyazawa A, Tanaka A, Sugano S, Shirouzu M, Nagayama K, Takenawa T, Yokoyama S | title = Curved EFC/F-BAR-domain dimers are joined end to end into a filament for membrane invagination in endocytosis | journal = Cell | volume = 129 | issue = 4 | pages = 761–72 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17512409 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.03.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19816406"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhatia VK, Madsen KL, Bolinger PY, Kunding A, Hedegård P, Gether U, Stamou D | title = Amphipathic motifs in BAR domains are essential for membrane curvature sensing | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 28 | issue = 21 | pages = 3303–14 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19816406 | pmc = 2776096 | doi = 10.1038/emboj.2009.261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the cargo carriers are matured, the carrier scission is then catalyzed by [[DNM2|dynamin-II]] or [[EHD1]],&lt;ref name="pmid18378669"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Walseng E, Bakke O, Roche PA | title = Major histocompatibility complex class II-peptide complexes internalize using a clathrin- and dynamin-independent endocytosis pathway | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 283 | issue = 21 | pages = 14717–27 | date = May 2008 | pmid = 18378669 | pmc = 2386912 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M801070200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; together with the mechanical forces generated by actin polymerization and motor activity.

The cargo carrier is transported to the [[Golgi apparatus#Structure|TGN]] by motor proteins such as [[dynein]]. Tethering of the cargo carrier to the recipient compartment will lead to the uncoating of the carrier which is driven by ATP-hydrolysis and Rab7-GTP hydrolysis. Once released from the carrier, the Vps35-Vps29-Vps26 complex and the SNX-BAR dimers get recycled back onto the endosomal membranes.

[[File:Klonglan waterfall 03.jpg|thumb|260px|right| This waterfall and fast flowing water in [[Khlong Lan National Park]] is also part of a river ecosystem]]

River [[ecosystem|ecosystems]] are flowing waters that drain the landscape, and include the [[Biotic component|biotic]] (living) interactions amongst plants, animals and micro-organisms, as well as [[abiotic]] (nonliving) physical and chemical interactions of its many parts.&lt;ref name=Ang&gt;Angelier, E.  2003.  Ecology of Streams and Rivers.  Science Publishers, Inc., Enfield. Pp. 215.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BiologyConcepts&amp;Connections&gt;”Biology Concepts &amp; Connections Sixth Edition”, Campbell, Neil A. (2009), page 2, 3 and G-9. Retrieved 2010-06-14.&lt;/ref&gt; River ecosystems are part of larger [[Drainage basin|watershed]] networks or catchments, where smaller [[headwater]] streams drain into mid-size streams, which progressively drain into larger river networks. 

River ecosystems are prime examples of lotic ecosystems. ''Lotic'' refers to flowing water, from the [[Latin]] ''lotus'', meaning washed. Lotic waters range from [[Spring (water)|spring]]s only a few centimeters wide to major [[river]]s kilometers in width.&lt;ref name=Allan&gt;Allan, J.D.  1995.  Stream Ecology: structure and function of running waters. Chapman and Hall, London.  Pp. 388.
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this article applies to lotic ecosystems in general, including related lotic systems such as [[stream]]s and [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]]. Lotic ecosystems can be contrasted with [[lentic ecosystems]], which involve relatively still terrestrial waters such as lakes, ponds, and [[Wetland|wetlands]]. Together, these two ecosystems form the more general study area of freshwater or [[aquatic ecology]].

The following unifying characteristics make the ecology of running waters unique among aquatic habitats.&lt;ref name=Gill&gt;Giller, S. and B. Malmqvist.  1998.  The Biology of Streams and Rivers. Oxford University Press, Oxford.  Pp. 296.&lt;/ref&gt;
::* Flow is unidirectional.
::* There is a state of continuous physical change.
::* There is a high degree of spatial and temporal heterogeneity at all scales ([[microhabitat]]s).
::* Variability between lotic systems is quite high.
::* The biota is specialized to live with flow conditions.

===Water flow===
Unidirectional water flow is the key factor in lotic systems influencing their ecology. Stream flow can be continuous or intermittent, though . Stream flow is the result of the summative inputs from groundwater, precipitation, and overland flow. Water flow can vary between systems, ranging from torrential rapids to slow backwaters that almost seem like lentic systems. The speed or velocity of the water flow of the water column can also vary within a system and is subject to chaotic turbulence, though water velocity tends to be highest in the middle part of the stream channel (known as the [[Thalweg|thalveg]]). This turbulence results in divergences of flow from the mean downslope flow vector as typified by eddy currents.  The mean flow rate vector is based on variability of friction with the bottom or sides of the channel, [[sinuosity]], obstructions, and the incline gradient.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt;  In addition, the amount of water input into the system from direct precipitation, [[snowmelt]], and/or groundwater can affect flow rate. The amount of water in a stream is measured as [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]] (volume per unit time). As water flows downstream, streams and rivers most often gain water volume, so at [[Baseflow|base flow]] (i.e., no storm input), smaller headwater streams have very low discharge, while larger rivers have much higher discharge. The "flow regime" of a river or stream includes the general patterns of discharge over annual or decadal time scales, and may capture seasonal changes in flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Canadian Science Publishing|url=http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f89-228#.W_yLUS3MxHQ|doi=10.1139/f89-228#.w_ylus3mxhq}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poff|first=N. LeRoy|last2=Allan|first2=J.

While water flow is strongly determined by slope, flowing waters can alter the general shape or direction of the stream bed, a characteristic also known as [[geomorphology]]. The profile of the river water column is made up of three primary actions: erosion, transport, and deposition. Rivers have been described as "the gutters down which run the ruins of continents".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://store.doverpublications.com/0486685888.html|title=Fluvial Processes in Geomorphology|website=store.doverpublications.com|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivers are continuously [[Erosion|eroding]], transporting, and [[Deposition (geology)|depositing]] substrate, sediment, and organic material. The continuous movement of water and entrained material creates a variety of habitats, including [[riffle]]s, [[Bacterial gliding|glides]], and [[Stream pool|pools]].&lt;ref name="Cush"&gt;Cushing, C.E. and J.D.

[[File:Overlander Falls.JPG|thumb|right|Rapids in [[Mount Robson Provincial Park]]]]

'''Light''' is important to lotic systems, because it provides the energy necessary to drive [[primary production]] via [[photosynthesis]], and can also provide refuge for prey species in shadows it casts.  The amount of light that a system receives can be related to a combination of internal and external stream variables.  The area surrounding a small stream, for example, might be shaded by surrounding forests or by valley walls.  Larger river systems tend to be wide so the influence of external variables is minimized, and the sun reaches the surface.  These rivers also tend to be more turbulent, however, and particles in the water increasingly attenuate light as depth increases.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt;  Seasonal and diurnal factors might also play a role in light availability because the angle of incidence, the angle at which light strikes water can lead to light lost from reflection.  Known as [[Beers law|Beer's Law]], the shallower the angle, the more light is reflected and the amount of solar radiation received declines logarithmically with depth.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; Additional influences on light availability include cloud cover, altitude, and geographic position.&lt;ref name=Brown1987&gt;Brown 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

===Temperature===
[[File:Castle Geyser, Yellowstone, 1874.jpg|thumb|right|[[Castle Geyser]], [[Yellowstone National Park]]]]

Most lotic species are [[poikilotherm]]s whose internal temperature varies with their environment, thus temperature is a key abiotic factor for them. Water can be heated or cooled through radiation at the surface and conduction to or from the air and surrounding substrate.  Shallow streams are typically well mixed and maintain a relatively uniform temperature within an area. In deeper, slower moving water systems, however, a strong difference between the bottom and surface temperatures may develop.  Spring fed systems have little variation as springs are typically from groundwater sources, which are often very close to ambient temperature.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;  Many systems show strong [[Diurnal temperature variation|diurnal]] fluctuations and seasonal variations are most extreme in arctic, desert and temperate systems.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;  The amount of shading, climate and elevation can also influence the temperature of lotic systems.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt;

===Chemistry===
[[File:Winter Forest Near Erzhausen II.jpg|thumb|right|A forest stream in the winter near [[Erzhausen]], [[Germany]]]]

Water chemistry in river ecosystems varies depending on which dissolved solutes and gases are present in the water column of the stream. Specifically river water can include, apart from the water itself, 
* dissolved inorganic matter and major ions (calcium, sodium, magnesium, potassium, bicarbonate, sulfide, chloride)
* dissolved inorganic nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, silica)
* suspended and dissolved organic matter
* gases (nitrogen, nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide, oxygen)
* trace metals and pollutants

==== Dissolved ions and nutrients ====
Dissolved stream solutes can be considered either ''reactive'' or ''conservative''. Reactive solutes are readily biologically assimilated by the [[Autotroph|autotrophic]] and [[heterotrophic]] biota of the stream; examples can include inorganic nitrogen species such as nitrate or ammonium, some forms of phosphorus (e.g., soluble reactive phosphorus), and silica. Other solutes can be considered conservative, which indicates that the solute is not taken up and used biologically; chloride is often considered a conservative solute. Conservative solutes are often used as hydrologic tracers for water movement and transport. Both reactive and conservative stream water chemistry is foremost determined by inputs from the geology of its [[drainage basin|watershed]], or catchment area. Stream water chemistry can also be influenced by precipitation,  and the addition of pollutants from human sources.&lt;ref name="Allan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cush" /&gt; Large differences in chemistry do not usually exist within small lotic systems due to a high rate of mixing.  In larger river systems, however, the concentrations of most nutrients, dissolved salts, and pH decrease as distance increases from the river’s source.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt;

==== Dissolved gases ====
In terms of dissolved gases, [[oxygen]] is likely the most important chemical constituent of lotic systems, as all aerobic organisms require it for survival.  It enters the water mostly via diffusion at the water-air interface.  Oxygen’s solubility in water decreases as water pH and temperature increases. Fast, turbulent streams expose more of the water’s surface area to the air and tend to have low temperatures and thus more oxygen than slow, backwaters.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt; Oxygen is a byproduct of photosynthesis, so systems with a high abundance of aquatic algae and plants may also have high concentrations of oxygen during the day.  These levels can decrease significantly during the night when primary producers switch to respiration.  Oxygen can be limiting if circulation between the surface and deeper layers is poor, if the activity of lotic animals is very high, or if there is a large amount of organic decay occurring.&lt;ref name="Cush" /&gt;

==== Suspended matter ====
Rivers can also transport suspended inorganic and organic matter. These materials can include sediment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dean|first=David J.|last2=Topping|first2=David J.|last3=Schmidt|first3=John C.|last4=Griffiths|first4=Ronald E.|last5=Sabol|first5=Thomas A.|date=January 2016|title=Sediment supply versus local hydraulic controls on sediment transport and storage in a river with large sediment loads|url=https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2015JF003436|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Earth Surface|language=en|volume=121|issue=1|pages=82–110|doi=10.1002/2015jf003436|issn=2169-9003}}&lt;/ref&gt; or terrestrially-derived organic matter that falls into the stream channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Webster|first=J.

===Substrate===
[[File:Gabas 007.jpg|thumb|right|Cascade in the [[Pyrénées]]]]

The inorganic [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]] of lotic systems is composed of the [[geologic]] material present in the catchment that is eroded, transported, sorted, and deposited by the current.  Inorganic substrates are classified by size on the [[Wentworth scale]], which ranges from boulders, to pebbles, to gravel, to sand, and to silt.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; Typically, substrate [[Particle size (grain size)|particle size]] decreases downstream with larger boulders and stones in more mountainous areas and sandy bottoms in lowland rivers.  This is because the higher gradients of mountain streams facilitate a faster flow, moving smaller substrate materials further downstream for deposition.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; Substrate can also be organic and may include fine particles, autumn shed leaves, [[large woody debris]] such as submerged tree logs, moss, and semi-aquatic plants.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; Substrate deposition is not necessarily a permanent event, as it can be subject to large modifications during flooding events.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt;

==Biotic factors==
The living components of an ecosystem are called the biotic components. Streams have numerous types of biotic organisms that live in them, including bacteria, primary producers, insects and other invertebrates, as well as fish and other vertebrates.

=== Biofilm ===
[[Biofilm]] is the combination of algae, diatoms, fungi, bacteria, plankton, and other small [[microorganism]]s that exist in a film along the [[streambed]] or [[benthos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battin|first=Tom J.|last2=Besemer|first2=Katharina|last3=Bengtsson|first3=Mia M.|last4=Romani|first4=Anna M.|last5=Packmann|first5=Aaron I.|date=April 2016|title=The ecology and biogeochemistry of stream biofilms|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro.2016.15|journal=Nature Reviews Microbiology|language=En|volume=14|issue=4|pages=251–263|doi=10.1038/nrmicro.2016.15|issn=1740-1526}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biofilm assemblages themselves are complex,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Besemer|first=Katharina|last2=Peter|first2=Hannes|last3=Logue|first3=Jürg B|last4=Langenheder|first4=Silke|last5=Lindström|first5=Eva S|last6=Tranvik|first6=Lars J|last7=Battin|first7=Tom J|date=August 2012|title=Unraveling assembly of stream biofilm communities|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3400417/|journal=The ISME Journal|volume=6|issue=8|pages=1459–1468|doi=10.1038/ismej.2011.205|issn=1751-7362|pmc=3400417|pmid=22237539}}&lt;/ref&gt; and add to the complexity of a streambed. 

===Bacteria===
[[Bacteria]] are present in large numbers in lotic waters.  Free-living forms are associated with decomposing organic material, [[biofilm]] on the surfaces of rocks and vegetation, in between particles that compose the substrate, and suspended in the [[water column]].  Other forms are also associated with the guts of lotic organisms as parasites or in [[commensal]] relationships.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;  Bacteria play a large role in energy recycling (see [[#Trophic relationships|below]]).&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt;

===Primary producers===
[[File:Periphyton.jpg|thumb|right|Periphyton]]
[[File:water hyacinth.jpg|thumb|right|Common water hyacinth in flower]]

Algae, consisting of [[phytoplankton]] and [[periphyton]], are the most significant sources of primary production in most streams and rivers.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; Phytoplankton float freely in the water column and thus are unable to maintain populations in fast flowing streams.  They can, however, develop sizeable populations in slow moving rivers and backwaters.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; Periphyton are typically filamentous and tufted algae that can attach themselves to objects to avoid being washed away by fast currents.  In places where flow rates are negligible or absent, periphyton may form a gelatinous, unanchored floating mat.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt;

Plants exhibit limited adaptations to fast flow and are most successful in reduced currents.  More primitive plants, such as [[moss]]es and [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s attach themselves to solid objects.  This typically occurs in colder headwaters where the mostly rocky substrate offers attachment sites.  Some plants are free floating at the water’s surface in dense mats like [[duckweed]] or [[water hyacinth]].  Others are rooted and may be classified as submerged or emergent.  Rooted plants usually occur in areas of slackened current where fine-grained soils are found.&lt;ref name=Brown1987/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; These rooted plants are flexible, with elongated leaves that offer minimal resistance to current.&lt;ref name=Ang/&gt;

Living in flowing water can be beneficial to plants and algae because the current is usually well aerated and it provides a continuous supply of nutrients.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; These organisms are limited by flow, light, water chemistry, substrate, and grazing pressure.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;  Algae and plants are important to lotic systems as sources of energy, for forming microhabitats that shelter other fauna from predators and the current, and as a food resource.&lt;ref name=Brown1987/&gt;
{{clear}}

===Insects and other invertebrates===
Up to 90% of [[invertebrate]]s in some lotic systems are [[insect]]s.  These species exhibit tremendous diversity and can be found occupying almost every available habitat, including the surfaces of stones, deep below the substratum in the [[hyporheic zone]], adrift in the current, and in the surface film. 

Insects have developed several strategies for living in the diverse flows of lotic systems.  Some avoid high current areas, inhabiting the substratum or the sheltered side of rocks. Others have flat bodies to reduce the drag forces they experience from living in running water.&lt;ref name="Poff_2006"&gt; {{cite journal

}} &lt;/ref&gt;. Some insects time their life events based on when floods and droughts occur. For example, some mayflies synchronize when they emerge as flying adults with when snowmelt flooding usually occurs in Colorado streams. Other insects do not have a flying stage and spend their entire life cycle in the river. 

Like most of the primary consumers, lotic invertebrates often rely heavily on the current to bring them food and oxygen.&lt;ref name="CumminsKlug"&gt; {{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invertebrates are important as both consumers and prey items in lotic systems.

The common orders of insects that are found in river ecosystems include [[Ephemeroptera]] (also known as a [[mayfly]]), [[Trichoptera]] (also known as a [[caddisfly]]), [[Plecoptera]] (also known as a [[stonefly]], [[Diptera]] (also known as a true [[fly]]), some types of [[Coleoptera]] (also known as a [[beetle]]), [[Odonata]] (the group that includes the [[dragonfly]] and the [[damselfly]]), and some types of [[Hemiptera]] (also known as true bugs).

Additional invertebrate [[taxa]] common to flowing waters include [[mollusk]]s such as [[snail]]s, [[limpet]]s, [[clam]]s, [[mussel]]s, as well as [[crustacean]]s like [[crayfish]], [[amphipoda]] and [[crab]]s.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt;

===Fish and other vertebrates===
[[File:Salvelinus fontinalis.jpg|thumb|right|The [[brook trout]] is native to small streams, creeks, lakes, and spring ponds.]]
[[File:New Zealand long fin eel.jpg|thumb|right|[[New Zealand longfin eel]]s can weigh over 50 kilograms.]]

Fish are probably the best-known inhabitants of lotic systems.  The ability of a fish species to live in flowing waters depends upon the speed at which it can swim and the duration that its speed can be maintained.  This ability can vary greatly between species and is tied to the habitat in which it can survive.  Continuous swimming expends a tremendous amount of energy and, therefore, fishes spend only short periods in full current.  Instead, individuals remain close to the bottom or the banks, behind obstacles, and sheltered from the current, swimming in the current only to feed or change locations.&lt;ref name=Ang /&gt; Some species have adapted to living only on the system bottom, never venturing into the open water flow.  These fishes are [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorso-ventrally]] flattened to reduce flow resistance and often have eyes on top of their heads to observe what is happening above them.  Some also have sensory barrels positioned under the head to assist in the testing of substratum.&lt;ref name=Brown1987/&gt;

Lotic systems typically connect to each other, forming a path to the ocean (spring → stream → river → ocean), and many fishes have life cycles that require stages in both fresh and salt water.  [[Salmon]], for example, are [[anadromous]] species that are born in freshwater but spend most of their adult life in the ocean, returning to fresh water only to spawn. [[Eel]]s are [[catadromous]] species that [[Eel life history|do the opposite]], living in freshwater as adults but migrating to the ocean to spawn.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

Other vertebrate taxa that inhabit lotic systems include [[amphibian]]s, such as [[salamander]]s, [[reptile]]s (e.g. snakes, turtles, crocodiles and alligators) various bird species, and mammals (e.g., [[otter]]s, [[beaver]]s, [[hippopotamus|hippos]], and [[river dolphin]]s).  With the exception of a few species, these vertebrates are not tied to water as fishes are, and spend part of their time in terrestrial habitats.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; Many fish species are important as consumers and as prey species to the larger vertebrates mentioned above.

==Trophic relationships==

===Energy inputs===
[[File:ElodeaCanadensis.jpg|thumb|right|[[Elodea canadensis|Pondweed]] is an autochthonous energy source]]
[[File:Stream at the Walhalla ravine.jpg|thumb|right|Leaf litter is an allochthonous energy source]]

Energy sources can be [[Indigenous (ecology)|autochthonous]] or [[allochthonous]].

* '''Autochthonous''' (from the latin "auto" = "self) energy sources are those derived from within the lotic system.  During [[photosynthesis]], for example, [[primary producer]]s form organic carbon compounds out of carbon dioxide and inorganic matter.  The energy they produce is important for the community because it may be transferred to higher [[trophic level]]s via consumption. Additionally, high rates of [[primary production]] can introduce [[dissolved organic matter]] (DOM) to the waters.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; Another form of autochthonous energy comes from the decomposition of dead organisms and feces that originate within the lotic system.  In this case, bacteria decompose the [[detritus]] or coarse [[particulate]] organic material (CPOM; &gt;1&amp;nbsp;mm pieces) into fine particulate organic  matter (FPOM; &lt;1&amp;nbsp;mm pieces) and then further into inorganic compounds that are required for photosynthesis.&lt;ref name="Allan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tank|first=Jennifer L.|last2=Rosi-Marshall|first2=Emma J.|last3=Griffiths|first3=Natalie A.|last4=Entrekin|first4=Sally A.|last5=Stephen|first5=Mia L.|date=March 2010|title=A review of allochthonous organic matter dynamics and metabolism in streams|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1899/08-170.1|journal=Journal of the North American Benthological Society|language=en|volume=29|issue=1|pages=118–146|doi=10.1899/08-170.1|issn=0887-3593}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is discussed in more detail below.
* '''Allochthonous''' energy sources are those derived from outside the lotic system, that is, from the terrestrial environment.  Leaves, twigs, fruits, etc. are typical forms of terrestrial CPOM that have entered the water by direct litter fall or lateral leaf blow.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;  In addition, terrestrial animal-derived materials, such as feces or carcasses that have been added to the system are examples of allochthonous CPOM.   The CPOM undergoes a specific process of degradation. Allan gives the example of a leaf fallen into a stream.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; First, the soluble chemicals are dissolved and [[Leaching (chemical science)|leached]] from the leaf upon its saturation with water. This adds to the DOM load in the system. Next [[microbe]]s such as [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] [[colonize]] the leaf, softening it as the [[mycelium]] of the fungus grows into it.  The composition of the microbial community is influenced by the species of tree from which the leaves are shed (Rubbo and Kiesecker 2004).  This combination of bacteria, fungi, and leaf are a food source for [[invertebrate|shredding invertebrate]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=U.S. EPA|title=Classifications of Macroinvertebrates|url=http://www.epa.gov/bioiweb1/html/invertclass.html|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which leave only FPOM after consumption.  These fine particles may be colonized by microbes again or serve as a food source for animals that consume FPOM.  Organic matter can also enter the lotic system already in the FPOM stage by wind, [[surface runoff]], [[River bank|bank]] [[erosion]], or [[groundwater]].  Similarly, DOM can be introduced through [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] drip from rain or from surface flows&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;.

===Invertebrates===
[[Invertebrate]]s can be organized into many [[Guild (ecology)|feeding guilds]] in lotic systems.  Some species are shredders, which use large and powerful mouth parts to feed on non-woody CPOM and their associated microorganisms.  Others are [[Filter feeder|suspension feeder]]s, which use their [[setae]], filtering aparati, nets, or even secretions to collect FPOM and microbes from the water.  These species may be passive collectors, utilizing the natural flow of the system, or they may generate their own current to draw water, and also, FPOM in Allan.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; Members of the gatherer-collector guild actively search for FPOM under rocks and in other places where the stream flow has slackened enough to allow deposition.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; Grazing invertebrates utilize scraping, rasping, and browsing adaptations to feed on [[periphyton]] and [[detritus]]. Finally, several families are predatory, capturing and consuming animal prey. Both the number of species and the abundance of individuals within each guild is largely dependent upon food availability. Thus, these values may vary across both seasons and systems.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt;

===Fish===
Fish can also be placed into [[Guild (ecology)|feeding guilds]]. Planktivores pick [[plankton]] out of the [[water column]].  [[Herbivore]]-[[detritivore]]s are [[Bottom feeder|bottom-feeding]] species that ingest both [[periphyton]] and [[detritus]] indiscriminately.  Surface and water column feeders capture surface prey (mainly terrestrial and emerging insects) and drift ([[benthic]] invertebrates floating downstream).  Benthic invertebrate feeders prey primarily on immature insects, but will also consume other benthic invertebrates.  [[Apex predator|Top predators]] consume fishes and/or large invertebrates.  [[Omnivore]]s ingest a wide range of prey.  These can be [[floral]], [[fauna]]l, and/or  detrital in nature.  Finally, [[parasite]]s live off of host species, typically other fishes.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; Fish are flexible in their feeding roles, capturing different prey with regard to seasonal availability and their own developmental stage.  Thus, they may occupy multiple feeding  guilds in their lifetime.  The number of species in each guild can vary greatly between systems, with temperate warm water streams having the most benthic invertebrate feeders, and tropical systems having large numbers of detritus feeders due to high rates of [[allochthonous]] input.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt;

===Local species richness===
Large rivers have comparatively more species than small streams.  Many relate this pattern to the greater area and volume of larger systems, as well as an increase in habitat diversity.  Some systems, however, show a poor fit between system size and [[species richness]].  In these cases, a combination of factors such as historical rates of [[speciation]] and [[extinction]], type of [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]], [[microhabitat]] availability, water chemistry, temperature, and disturbance such as flooding seem to be important.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

===Resource partitioning===
Although many alternate theories have been postulated for the ability of [[Guild (ecology)|guild-mates]] to coexist (see Morin 1999), [[resource partitioning]] has been well documented in lotic systems as a means of reducing competition.   The three main types of resource partitioning include habitat, dietary, and temporal segregation.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

[[Niche differentiation#Spatial partitioning|Habitat segregation]] was found to be the most common type of resource partitioning in natural systems (Schoener, 1974).  In lotic systems, microhabitats provide a level of physical complexity that can support a diverse array of organisms (Vincin and Hawknis, 1998).  The separation of species by substrate preferences has been well documented for invertebrates.  Ward (1992) was able to divide substrate dwellers into six broad assemblages, including those that live in: coarse substrate, gravel, sand, mud, woody debris, and those associated with plants, showing one layer of segregation.  On a smaller scale, further habitat partitioning can occur on or around a single substrate, such as a piece of gravel.  Some invertebrates prefer the high flow areas on the exposed top of the gravel, while others reside in the crevices between one piece of gravel and the next, while still others live on the bottom of this gravel piece.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

Dietary segregation is the second-most common type of resource partitioning.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; High degrees of [[Niche differentiation#Morphological differentiation|morphological specializations]] or behavioral differences allow organisms to use specific resources.  The size of nets built by some species of invertebrate [[Filter feeder|suspension feeder]]s, for example, can filter varying particle size of FPOM from the water (Edington et al. 1984).  Similarly, members in the grazing guild can specialize in the harvesting of algae or detritus depending upon the morphology of their scraping apparatus.  In addition, certain species seem to show a preference for specific algal species.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

[[Niche differentiation#Temporal partitioning|Temporal segregation]] is a less common form of resource partitioning, but it is nonetheless an observed phenomenon.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; Typically, it accounts for coexistence by relating it to differences in life history patterns and the timing of maximum growth among guild mates.  Tropical fishes in [[Borneo]], for example, have shifted to shorter life spans in response to the [[ecological niche]] reduction felt with increasing levels of species richness in their ecosystem (Watson and Balon 1984).

===Persistence and succession===
Over long time scales, there is a tendency for species composition in pristine systems to remain in a stable state.&lt;ref&gt;Hildrew, A.G. and P.S. Giller.  1994.  Patchiness, species interactions and disturbance in the stream [[benthos]]. In Aquatic Ecology: scale pattern and process.  (P.S. Giller, A.G. Hildrew, and D.G. Rafaelli eds.) Blackwell, Oxford.  Pp. 21–62.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been found for both invertebrate and fish species.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; On shorter time scales, however, flow variability and unusual precipitation patterns decrease habitat stability and can all lead to declines in persistence levels. The ability to maintain this persistence over long time scales is related to the ability of lotic systems to return to the original community configuration relatively quickly after a disturbance (Townsend et al. 1987). This is one example of temporal succession, a site-specific change in a community involving changes in species composition over time.  Another form of temporal succession might occur when a new habitat is opened up for [[colonization]]. In these cases, an entirely new community that is well adapted to the conditions found in this new area can establish itself.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

===River continuum concept===

The [[River continuum concept]] (RCC) was an attempt to construct a single framework to describe the function of temperate lotic ecosystems from the headwaters to larger rivers and relate key characteristics to changes in the biotic community  (Vannote et al. 1980).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vannote|first=R.L|date=1980|title=The River Continuum Concept|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences|volume=37|pages=|via=Canadian Science Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical basis for RCC is size and location along the gradient from a small stream eventually linked to a large river.  Stream order (see [[Stream#Characteristics of streams|characteristics of streams]]) is used as the physical measure of the position along the RCC.

According to the RCC, low ordered sites are small shaded streams where allochthonous inputs of CPOM are a necessary resource for consumers.  As the river widens at mid-ordered sites, energy inputs should change.  Ample sunlight should reach the bottom in these systems to support significant periphyton production.  Additionally, the biological processing of CPOM (Coarse Particulate Organic Matter - larger than 1&amp;nbsp;mm) inputs at upstream sites is expected to result in the transport of large amounts of FPOM (Fine Particulate Organic Matter - smaller than 1&amp;nbsp;mm) to these downstream ecosystems.  Plants should become more abundant at edges of the river with increasing river size, especially in lowland rivers where finer sediments have been deposited and facilitate rooting. The main channels likely have too much current and turbidity and a lack of substrate to support plants or periphyton.  Phytoplankton should produce the only autochthonous inputs here, but photosynthetic rates will be limited due to turbidity and mixing.  Thus, allochthonous inputs are expected to be the primary energy source for large rivers. This FPOM will come from both upstream sites via the decomposition process and through lateral inputs from floodplains.

Biota should change with this change in energy from the headwaters to the mouth of these systems.  Namely, shredders should prosper in low-ordered systems and grazers in mid-ordered sites.  Microbial decomposition should play the largest role in energy production for low-ordered sites and large rivers, while photosynthesis, in addition to degraded allochthonous inputs from upstream will be essential in mid-ordered systems.  As mid-ordered sites will theoretically receive the largest variety of energy inputs, they might be expected to host the most biological diversity (Vannote et al. 1980).&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt;

Just how well the RCC actually reflects patterns in natural systems is uncertain and its generality can be a handicap when applied to diverse and specific situations.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt; The most noted criticisms of the RCC are: 1. It focuses mostly on [[macroinvertebrates]], disregarding that plankton and fish diversity is highest in high orders; 2. It relies heavily on the fact that low ordered sites have high CPOM inputs, even though many streams lack [[riparian]] habitats; 3. It is based on pristine systems, which rarely exist today; and 4. It is centered around the functioning of temperate streams.  Despite its shortcomings, the RCC remains a useful idea for describing how the patterns of ecological functions in a lotic system can vary from the source to the mouth.&lt;ref name=Allan/&gt;

Disturbances such as congestion by dams or natural events such as shore flooding are not included in the RCC model.&lt;ref name="Junk J.W. 1989"&gt;Junk J.W., P.B. Bayley, R.E. Sparks: “The flood pulse concept in river flood plain systems”. Canadian Special Publications of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences. 106. 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Various researchers have since expanded the model to account for such irregularities.  For example, J.V. Ward and J.A. Stanford came up with the Serial Discontinuity Concept in 1983, which addresses the impact of [[Geomorphology|geomorphologic]] disorders such as congestion and integrated inflows.  The same authors presented the Hyporheic Corridor concept in 1993, in which the vertical (in depth) and lateral (from shore to shore) structural complexity of the river were connected.&lt;ref&gt;Ward J.V., J.A. Stanford: The Serial Discontinuity Concept of River Ecosystems.  T.D. Fontaine, S.M. Bartell: “Dynamics of Lotic Ecosystems”. Science Publications, Ann Arbor Mich  29-42. 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[flood pulse concept]], developed by W.J. Junk in 1989, further modified by P.B. Bayley in 1990 and K. Tockner in 2000, takes into account the large amount of nutrients and organic material that makes its way into a river from the sediment of surrounding flooded land.&lt;ref name="Junk J.W. 1989"/&gt;

==Human impacts==

===Pollution===
River pollution can include but is not limited to: increasing sediment export, excess nutrients from fertilizer or urban runoff,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fertilizer-runoff-overwhelms-streams/|title=Fertilizer Runoff Overwhelms Streams and Rivers--Creating Vast "Dead Zones"|last=Biello|first=David|work=Scientific American|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; sewage and septic inputs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2015/septic-tanks-arent-keeping-poo-out-of-rivers-and-lakes/|title=Septic tanks aren't keeping poo out of rivers and lakes|last=University|first=Michigan State|work=MSUToday|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; plastic pollution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.maritime-executive.com/editorials/growing-concern-over-plastic-pollution-in-rivers-and-lakes|title=Growing Concern over Plastic Pollution in Rivers and Lakes|work=The Maritime Executive|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; nano-particles, pharmaceuticals and personal care products,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolpin|first=Dana W.|last2=Furlong|first2=Edward T.|last3=Meyer|first3=Michael T.|last4=Thurman|first4=E.

Pollutant sources of lotic systems are hard to control because they can derive, often in small amounts, over a very wide area and enter the system at many locations along its length. While direct pollution of lotic systems has been greatly reduced in the United States under the government’s [[Clean Water Act]], contaminants from diffuse non-point sources remain a large problem.&lt;ref name=Cush/&gt; Agricultural fields often deliver large quantities of sediments, nutrients, and chemicals to nearby streams and rivers. Urban and residential areas can also add to this pollution when contaminants are accumulated on impervious surfaces such as roads and parking lots that then drain into the system.  Elevated nutrient concentrations, especially nitrogen and phosphorus which are key components of fertilizers, can increase periphyton growth, which can be particularly dangerous in slow-moving streams.&lt;ref name="Cush" /&gt; Another pollutant, [[acid rain]], forms from sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxide emitted from factories and power stations.  These substances readily dissolve in atmospheric moisture and enter lotic systems through precipitation. This can lower the pH of these sites, affecting all trophic levels from algae to vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Brown1987/&gt; Mean species richness and total species numbers within a system decrease with decreasing pH.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt;

===Flow modification===
[[File:River Calder Weir.JPG|thumb|right|A [[weir]] on the [[River Calder, West Yorkshire|River Calder]], [[West Yorkshire]]]]

Flow modification can occur as a result of [[Dam|dams]], water regulation and extraction, channel modification, and the destruction of the river floodplain and adjacent riparian zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.niwa.co.nz/our-science/freshwater/tools/kaitiaki_tools/impacts/in-stream-barriers/changes-in-flow|title=Altered water flow (hydrology)|date=2009-07-06|work=NIWA|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Dam]]s alter the flow, temperature, and sediment regime of lotic systems.&lt;ref name="Gill" /&gt; Additionally, many rivers are dammed at multiple locations, amplifying the impact. Dams can cause enhanced clarity and reduced variability in stream flow, which in turn cause an increase in [[periphyton]] abundance.  \Invertebrates immediately below a dam can show reductions in species richness due to an overall reduction in habitat heterogeneity.&lt;ref name="Cush" /&gt;  Also, thermal changes can affect insect development, with abnormally warm winter temperatures obscuring cues to break egg [[diapause]] and overly cool summer temperatures leaving too few acceptable days to complete growth.&lt;ref name="Allan" /&gt; Finally, dams fragment river systems, isolating previously continuous populations, and preventing the migrations of [[anadromous]] and [[catadromous]] species.&lt;ref name="Cush" /&gt;

===Invasive species===
[[Invasive species]] have been introduced to lotic systems through both purposeful events (e.g. stocking game and food species) as well as unintentional events (e.g. hitchhikers on boats or fishing waders).  These organisms can affect natives via competition for prey or habitat, predation, habitat alteration, hybridization, or the introduction of harmful diseases and parasites.&lt;ref name=Gill/&gt; Once established, these species can be difficult to control or eradicate, particularly because of the connectivity of lotic systems.   Invasive species can be especially harmful in areas that have [[endangered]] biota, such as mussels in the Southeast United States, or those that have localized [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species, like lotic systems west of the Rocky Mountains, where many species evolved in isolation.

'''Speed learning''' is a collection of methods of [[learning]] which attempt to attain higher rates of learning without unacceptable reduction of [[Understanding|comprehension]] or [[Storage (memory)|retention]]. It is closely related to [[speed reading]], but encompasses other methods of learning, such as [[observation]], [[listening]], [[conversation]], [[question]]ing, and [[Introspection|reflection]].

The general approach is to use procedures or a sequence of techniques that have been shown to provide a more efficient path to attaining the same goal. Some of the techniques have existed since ancient times (e.g. [[Mnemonic]]s) whilst others are a result of more recent scientific research (e.g. [[Forgetting curve|Forgetting Curves]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bremer|first1=Rod|title=The Manual: A Guide to the Ultimate Study Method|publisher=Fons Sapientiae Publishing|isbn=978-0993496424|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
[[Psychologist]]s and [[education]]al specialists have long sought methods for improving not just the quality of learning, the comprehension and retention of knowledge, but the rate at which knowledge can be acquired, especially in an age in which the amount of information people need to deal with is growing rapidly and threatening to overwhelm them.

The limited "channel capacity" of human individuals has also led to investigation of rapid knowledge acquisition and appropriate dissemination of it by organizations. This is an important part of the science of [[management]]. It generally involves dividing the knowledge-acquisition effort among multiple individuals, each of whom becomes a "subject matter expert" on some specialized area of the larger topic, then having them extract and abstract the more important findings and recommendations from that investigation into reports to and discussions with others in the organization. This filtering process necessarily involves some loss of detail, but if done well should enable the organization or its managers to make high-quality, error-avoiding decisions. On the other hand, the loss of detail as abstraction of information ascends a hierarchical organization can lead to distortion that results in bad decision-making.

'''''The Way Things Work''''' is a 1988 children's book by [[David Macaulay]] with technical text by [[Neil Ardley]]. It is an entertaining introduction to everyday [[machine]]s, describing machines as simple as [[lever]]s and [[gear]]s and as complicated as [[radio telescope]]s and [[automatic transmission]]s. Every page consists primarily of one or more large diagrams describing the operation of the relevant machine. These diagrams are informative but playful, in that most show the machines operated, used upon, or represented by [[woolly mammoth]]s, and are accompanied by anecdotes of the mammoths' (fictive) role in the operation. The book's concept was later developed into a short-lived animated [[The Way Things Work (TV series)|TV show]] (produced by [[Millimages]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millimages.com/site/tv/prod.php?lang=en&amp;tv_id=6 |title=Television - THE WAY THINGS WORK |date=18 November 2008 |publisher=millimages.com |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118015449/http://www.millimages.com/site/tv/prod.php?lang=en&amp;tv_id=6 |archivedate=18 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and distributed by [[Schlessinger Media]]), a [[Dorling Kindersley]] interactive CD-ROM, and a [[board game]]. A family "ride" involving [[animatronics]] and a [[3-D film]] based on the book was one of the original attractions at the [[San Francisco]] [[Metreon]], but closed in 2001.

==''The New Way Things Work''==
A newer version, ''The New Way Things Work'', (released on October 26, 1998,) contains additional text on the workings of computers and digital technology.  It also lacks two pages of the first edition; both of which demonstrated the working of a mechanical coin-operated parking meter.

==''The Way Things Work Now''==
A substantially revised edition, ''The Way Things Work Now'', has been published in October 2016 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and Dorling Kindersley.

'''Thermal resistance''' is a heat property and a measurement of a temperature difference by which an object or material resists a [[heat flow]]. Thermal resistance is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of [[Thermal conductivity#Conductance|thermal conductance]].

*'''(Absolute) thermal resistance''' ''R'' in K/W is a property of a particular component. For example, a characteristic of a [[heat sink]].
*'''Specific thermal resistance''' or '''thermal resistivity''' ''R''&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; in (K·m)/W  is a [[material constant]].
*'''Thermal insulance''' has the units (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;K)/W in [[SI units]] or ([[foot (length)|ft]]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·[[Fahrenheit|°F]]·[[Hour|hr]])/[[British thermal unit|Btu]] in [[imperial units]]. It is the thermal resistance of unit area of a material. In terms of insulation, it is measured by the [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]].

== Absolute thermal resistance ==
Absolute thermal resistance is the [[temperature]] difference across a structure when a unit of [[heat]] energy flows through it in unit [[time]].  It is the reciprocal of [[thermal conductivity|thermal conductance]]. The [[SI]] units of thermal resistance are [[kelvin]]s per [[watt]] or the equivalent [[degrees Celsius]] per watt (the two are the same since the intervals are equal: Δ1 K&amp;nbsp;= Δ1 °C).

The thermal resistance of materials is of great interest to electronic engineers because most electrical components generate heat and need to be cooled. Electronic components malfunction or fail if they overheat, and some parts routinely need measures taken in the design stage to prevent this.

== Analogies ==
{{main | analogical models |Onsager reciprocal relations}}

Electrical engineers are familiar with [[Ohm's law]] and so often use it as an analogy when doing calculations involving thermal resistance.
Mechanical and Structural engineers are more familiar with [[Hooke's law]] and so often use it as an analogy when doing calculations involving thermal resistance.

=== Explanation from an electronics point of view ===

==== Equivalent thermal circuits ====
[[File:Equivalient thermal circuit 2.png|thumb|The diagram shows an equivalent thermal circuit for a semiconductor device with a [[heat sink]]:&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; is the power dissipated by the device.&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;T_{\rm J}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[junction temperature]] in the device.&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;T_{\rm C}&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature at its case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;T_{\rm H}&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature where the heat sink is attached.&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;T_{\rm amb}&lt;/math&gt; is the ambient air temperature.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;R_{\theta \rm JC}&lt;/math&gt; is the device's absolute thermal resistance from junction to case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;R_{\theta \rm CH}&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute thermal resistance from the case to the heatsink.&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;R_{\theta \rm HA}&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute thermal resistance of the heat sink.]]
The heat flow can be modelled by analogy to an electrical circuit where heat flow is represented by current, temperatures are represented by voltages, heat sources are represented by constant current sources, absolute thermal resistances are represented by resistors and thermal capacitances by capacitors.

The diagram shows an equivalent thermal circuit for a semiconductor device with a [[heat sink]].

==== Example calculation ====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2015}}
Consider a component such as a silicon transistor that is bolted to the metal frame of a piece of equipment.  The transistor's manufacturer will specify parameters in the datasheet called the ''absolute thermal resistance from junction to case'' (symbol: &lt;math&gt;R_{\theta \rm JC}&lt;/math&gt;), and the maximum allowable temperature of the semiconductor junction (symbol: &lt;math&gt;T_{J\rm max}&lt;/math&gt;).  The specification for the design should include a maximum temperature at which the circuit should function correctly.  Finally, the designer should consider how the heat from the transistor will escape to the environment: this might be by convection into the air, with or without the aid of a [[heat sink]], or by conduction through the [[printed circuit board]].  For simplicity, let us assume that the designer decides to bolt the transistor to a metal surface (or [[heat sink]]) that is guaranteed to be less than &lt;math&gt;\Delta T_{\rm HS}&lt;/math&gt; above the ambient temperature. Note: T&lt;sub&gt;HS&lt;/sub&gt; appears to be undefined.

Given all this information, the designer can construct a model of the heat flow from the semiconductor junction, where the heat is generated, to the outside world.  In our example, the heat has to flow from the junction to the case of the transistor, then from the case to the metalwork.  We do not need to consider where the heat goes after that, because we are told that the metalwork will conduct heat fast enough to keep the temperature less than &lt;math&gt;\Delta T_{\rm HS}&lt;/math&gt; above ambient: this is all we need to know.

Suppose the engineer wishes to know how much power he can put into the transistor before it overheats.  The calculations are as follows.

:Total absolute thermal resistance from junction to ambient = &lt;math&gt;R_{\theta \rm JC}+R_{\theta \rm B}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_{\theta \rm B}&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute thermal resistance of the bond between the transistor's case and the metalwork.  This figure depends on the nature of the bond - for example, a thermal bonding pad or [[thermal grease|thermal transfer grease]] might be used to reduce the absolute thermal resistance.

:Maximum temperature drop from junction to ambient = &lt;math&gt;T_{J\rm max}-(T_{\rm amb}+\Delta T_{\rm HS})&lt;/math&gt;.

We use the general principle that the temperature drop &lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; across a given absolute thermal resistance &lt;math&gt;R_{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; with a given heat flow &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; through it is:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T = Q \times R_{\theta}\,&lt;/math&gt;.
Substituting our own symbols into this formula gives:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{J\rm max}-(T_{\rm amb}+\Delta T_{\rm HS})=Q_{\rm max} \times (R_{\theta \rm JC}+R_{\theta \rm B}+R_{\theta \rm HA})\,&lt;/math&gt;, 
and, rearranging,
:&lt;math&gt;
   Q_{\rm max} = 
   { 
     { T_{J\rm max}-(T_{\rm amb}+\Delta T_{\rm HS}) } \over { R_{\theta \rm JC}+R_{\theta \rm B}+R_{\theta \rm HA} }
   }
&lt;/math&gt;

The designer now knows &lt;math&gt;Q_{\rm max}&lt;/math&gt;, the maximum power that the transistor can be allowed to dissipate, so he can design the circuit to limit the temperature of the transistor to a safe level.

Let us substitute some sample numbers:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{J\rm max} = 125 \ ^{\circ}\mbox{C}&lt;/math&gt; (typical for a silicon transistor)
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\rm amb} = 21 \ ^{\circ}\mbox{C}&lt;/math&gt; (a typical specification for commercial equipment)
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\theta \rm JC} = 1.5 \ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{W} \,&lt;/math&gt; (for a typical [[TO-220]] package{{citation needed|date=January 2015}})
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\theta \rm B} = 0.1 \ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{W} \,&lt;/math&gt;  (a typical value for an [[elastomer]] heat-transfer pad for a TO-220 package{{citation needed|date=January 2015}})
:&lt;math&gt;R_{\theta \rm HA} = 4 \ ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{W} \,&lt;/math&gt;  (a typical value for a heatsink for a TO-220 package{{citation needed|date=January 2015}})
The result is then:
:&lt;math&gt;Q = {{125-(21)} \over {1.5+0.1+4}} = 18.6 \ \mathrm{W} &lt;/math&gt;

This means that the transistor can dissipate about 18 watts before it overheats.  A cautious designer would operate the transistor at a lower power level to increase its [[Reliability engineering|reliability]].

This method can be generalised to include any number of layers of heat-conducting materials, simply by adding together the absolute thermal resistances of the layers and the temperature drops across the layers.

===Derived from Fourier's Law for heat conduction===

From [[Heat conduction#Fourier's law|Fourier's Law]] for [[heat conduction]], the following equation can be derived, and is valid as long as all of the parameters (x and k) are constant throughout the sample.

: &lt;math&gt; R_{\theta} = \frac{x}{A \times k}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* &lt;math&gt;R_{\theta}&lt;/math&gt; is the absolute thermal resistance (across the length of the material) (K/W)
* ''x'' is the length of the material (measured on a path parallel to the heat flow) (m)
* ''k'' is the thermal conductivity of the material (W/(K·m))
* ''A'' is the cross-sectional area (perpendicular to the path of heat flow) (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)

=== Problems with electrical resistance analogy ===
A 2008 review paper written by Philips researcher Clemens J. M. Lasance notes that: "Although there is an analogy between heat flow by conduction (Fourier’s law) and the flow of an electric current (Ohm’s law), the corresponding physical properties of thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity conspire to make the behavior of heat flow quite unlike the flow of electricity in normal situations. [...] Unfortunately, although the electrical and thermal differential equations are analogous, it is erroneous to conclude that there is any practical analogy between electrical and thermal resistance. This is because a material that is considered an insulator in electrical terms is about 20 orders of magnitude less conductive than a material that is considered a conductor, while, in thermal terms, the difference between an "insulator" and a "conductor" is only about three orders of magnitude. The entire range of thermal conductivity is then equivalent to the difference in electrical conductivity of high-doped and low-doped silicon."&lt;ref name="Lasance"/&gt;

== Measurement standards ==
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}

The junction-to-air thermal resistance can vary greatly depending on the ambient conditions.&lt;ref name="TongLai2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ho-Ming Tong|author2=Yi-Shao Lai|author3=C.P. Wong|title=Advanced Flip Chip Packaging|year=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4419-5768-9|pages=460–461}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A more sophisticated way of expressing the same fact is saying that junction-to-ambient thermal resistance is not Boundary-Condition Independent (BCI).&lt;ref name="Lasance"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/01457630701673188| title = Ten Years of Boundary-Condition- Independent Compact Thermal Modeling of Electronic Parts: A Review| journal = Heat Transfer Engineering| volume = 29| issue = 2| pages = 149| year = 2008| last1 = Lasance | first1 = C.

A JEDEC standard for measuring the junction-to-board thermal resistance (relevant for [[surface-mount technology]]) has been published as JESD51-8.&lt;ref name="Shabany2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Younes Shabany|title=Heat Transfer: Thermal Management of Electronics|year=2011|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-1468-0|pages=111–113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A JEDEC standard for measuring the junction-to-case thermal resistance (JESD51-14) is relatively newcomer, having been published in late 2010; it concerns only packages having a single heat flow and an exposed cooling surface.&lt;ref name="LasancePoppe2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Clemens J.M.

==Resistance in Composite Wall==

===Parallel thermal resistance===
Similarly to electrical circuits, the total thermal resistance for steady state conditions can be calculated as follows.&lt;br&gt;
[[File:Parallel Thermal Resistance.jpg|thumb|Parallel Thermal Resistance in composite walls]]

The total thermal resistance

 &lt;math&gt; { {1\over R_{\rm tot}} =  {1\over R_B} + {1\over R_C} }&lt;/math&gt;          (1)

Simplifying the equation, we get

 &lt;math&gt; {R_{\rm tot}= {R_B R_C\over R_B+R_C} } &lt;/math&gt;          (2)
With terms for the thermal resistance for conduction, we get

 &lt;math&gt; {R_{t,\rm cond}= {L\over (k_b+k_c)A}}&lt;/math&gt;          (3)

===Resistance in series and parallel===
It is often suitable to assume one-dimensional conditions, although the heat flow is multidimensional. Now, two different circuits may be used for this case. For case (a) (shown in picture), we presume [[isothermal]] surfaces for those normal to the x- direction, whereas for case (b) we presume [[adiabatic]] surfaces parallel to the x- direction. We may obtain different results for the total resistance &lt;math&gt; {R_{tot} }&lt;/math&gt; and the actual corresponding values of the heat transfer are bracketed by &lt;math&gt; {q} &lt;/math&gt;.  When the multidimensional effects becomes more significant, these differences are increased with increasing &lt;math&gt; {| k_f - k_g |} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Incropera, Dewitt, Bergman, Lavine 2013"&gt;{{cite book |last=Incropera, Dewitt, Bergman, Lavine |first= Frank P., David P., Theodore L., Adrienne S.|date=2013 |title=Principles of Heat and Mass Transfer,|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons; 7th Edition, Interna edition|isbn=978-0470646151}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br&gt;
[[File:Equivalent thermal circuits for series-parallel composite wall.jpg|thumb|Equivalent thermal circuits for series-parallel composite wall]]

=== Radial Systems ===
Spherical and cylindrical systems may be treated as one-dimensional, due to the [[temperature gradient]]s in the radial direction. The standard method can be used for analyzing radial systems under steady state conditions, starting with the appropriate form of the heat equation, or the alternative method, starting with the appropriate form of [[Fourier's law]]. For a hollow cylinder in steady state conditions with no heat generation, the appropriate form of heat equation is &lt;ref name="Incropera, Dewitt, Bergman, Lavine 2013"/&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;{ {1\over r}{d\over dr} \left(kr{dT\over dr} \right)= 0  }&lt;/math&gt;          (4)

Where &lt;math&gt; {k } &lt;/math&gt; is treated as a variable. Considering the appropriate form of Fourier's law, the physical significance of treating &lt;math&gt; {k } &lt;/math&gt; as a variable becomes evident when the rate at which energy is conducted across a cylindrical surface, this is represented as

 &lt;math&gt;{ q_r = -kA {dT \over dr} = -k(2\pi rL){dT\over dr}}&lt;/math&gt;          (5)

Where &lt;math&gt; {A=2\pi rL} &lt;/math&gt; is the area that is normal to the direction of where the heat transfer occurs. Equation 1 implies that the quantity &lt;math&gt; {kr(dT/dr)} &lt;/math&gt; is not dependent of the radius &lt;math&gt; {r} &lt;/math&gt;, it follows from equation 5 that the heat transfer rate, &lt;math&gt; {q_r } &lt;/math&gt; is a constant in the radial direction.
[[File:Hollow cylinder with convective surface conditions.jpg|thumb|Hollow cylinder with convective surface conditions in thermal conduction]]

In order to determine the temperature distribution in the cylinder, equation 4 can be solved applying the appropriate [[boundary condition]]s. With the assumption that &lt;math&gt; {k } &lt;/math&gt; is constant

 &lt;math&gt; { T(r) = C_1\ln r + C_2} &lt;/math&gt;          (6)
Using the following boundary conditions, the constants &lt;math&gt; {C_1} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; {C_2} &lt;/math&gt; can be computed
 &lt;math&gt; {   T(r_1)=T_{s,1}}&lt;/math&gt;          and          &lt;math&gt; {T(r_2)=T_{s,2}    } &lt;/math&gt;

The general solution gives us

 &lt;math&gt; { T_{s,1} = C_1 \ln r_1 + C_2 }&lt;/math&gt;          and          &lt;math&gt; { T_{s,2} = C_1 \ln r_2 + C_2 } &lt;/math&gt;
Solving for &lt;math&gt; { C_1} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; { C_2} &lt;/math&gt; and substituting into the general solution, we obtain
 &lt;math&gt; {   T(r) = {T_{s,1}- T_{s,2}\over  {\ln(r_1/r_2) } } \ln \left( {r \over r_2} \right) + T_{s,2}} &lt;/math&gt;          (7)
The logarithmic distribution of the temperature is sketched in the inset of the thumbnail figure.
Assuming that the temperature distribution, equation 7, is used with Fourier’s law in equation 5, the heat transfer rate can be expressed in the following form

 &lt;math&gt; {Q_r = {2\pi Lk (T_{s,1}-T_{s,2}) \over \ln(r_2/r_1)} } &lt;/math&gt;
Finally, for radial conduction in a cylindrical wall, the thermal resistance is of the form
 &lt;math&gt; { R_{t,\mathrm{cond}}  = {\ln(r_2/r_1) \over 2\pi Lk}               }&lt;/math&gt;

== Activism ==

Steuer is known as a spokesperson and leader in the financial literacy movement. In 2016, Steuer’s son (age 11) was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Faced with a chronic illness that requires constant maintenance, Steuer realized his own son could be denied insurance coverage under the health care plan proposed by President Donald Trump. This led him to author the petition Fair Health Insurance For All, described as a petition to the U.S. Senate to seek a “solution” to health insurance costs. And that “any solution should simplify and seek to reduce costs while maintaining and increasing benefits.”

Steuer also authored The Insurance Bill of Rights, which is designed to empower consumers, and provides a Best Practices Roadmap for members of the insurance industry.

ZHdK is one of four universities affiliated to [[Zürcher Fachhochschule]].

ZHdK offers Bachelor’s and master's degree courses and further education programmes in [[art]], [[design]], [[music]], [[art education]], [[theatre]], [[film]], [[dance]], transdisciplinary studies as well as PhD programmes in collaboration with different international Art Uniuversities and with [[ETH Zurich]]. ZHdK holds an active role in research, especially in artistic research and design research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zürcher Hochschule der Künste|url=http://www.eenc.info/fr/organisation/zurich-university-of-the-arts/|work= eenc.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Affiliated to ZHdK are the [[Museum of Design, Zurich]], the Theater der Künste (Theatre of the Arts), the Mehrspur Music Club, and the Media and Information Centre (MIZ).

== History ==
Established on 1 August 2007, Zurich University of the Arts (ZHdK) resulted from the merger between the [[Hochschule für Gestaltung und Kunst Zürich]] (HGKZ), which had arisen from the [[Kunstgewerbeschule Zürich]] (founded in 1878), and the School of Music, Drama, and Dance (HMT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zurich University of the Arts Universities Handbook |url=http://www.universitieshandbook.com/directory/canton-zurich/zurich-university-of-the-arts |work= universitieshandbook.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130501144050/http://www.universitieshandbook.com/directory/canton-zurich/zurich-university-of-the-arts |archivedate=May 1, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding president of the new arts university was Professor Hans-Peter Schwarz. Since November 2009, Professor Thomas D. Meier has been president of ZHdK.

The Hochschule für Gestaltung und Kunst Zürich (HGKZ) arose from the [[Kunstgewerbeschule]] Zürich (founded in 1878). It was located in a building constructed by architects Adolf Steger and Karl Egender, which today also houses the [[Museum of Design, Zurich]].

The School of Music, Drama, and Dance (HMT) was the result of a merger in 1999 between Winterthur and Zurich conservatories of music, Zurich’s Jazz School, Zurich’s Theatre and Acting Academy, and the Swiss Professional Ballet School. ZHdK’s programme in Theatre Studies (affiliated to the Department of Performing Arts and Film) was originally established in 1937, in the context of the [[Schauspielhaus Zürich]] (the city’s principal theatre), and known as the  Bühnenstudio Zürich. It was renamed Schauspiel-Akademie Zürich in the early 1970s.

Following the 2007 school merger, ZHdK occupies 35 sites, spread across the cities of Zurich (Ausstellungsstrasse, Florhof, Mediacampus, Gessnerallee) and Winterthur. In the autumn of 2014, ZHdK will be relocating to its new campus: the Toni Areal (under construction) in the city’s thriving western district ([[Zurich West]]). With the exception of its Gessnerallee annex, ZHdK will be leaving all other sites to unite the arts under one roof. The [[Museum of Design, Zurich]] and the Bellerive Museum will remain at their current locations.

== Teaching and research ==
ZHdK offers taught Bachelor’s and master's degree courses, which have replaced the former diploma courses in the wake of the [[Bologna Process]]. Places on all degree courses are limited. The university also offers a foundation course in art and design and various further educating courses, leading either to a Certificate of Advanced Studies (CAS) or a Master of Advanced Studies (MAS).

With research becoming more firmly established at universities of applied sciences, ZHdK has significantly intensified its research activities. Its seven research institutes and two centres of excellence focus on artistic research in particular. Research is also undertaken in the fields of [[design]], [[art history]], art education, and [[musicology]]. And, ZhdK is also running several joint PhD programmes in cooperation with national and international universities.
