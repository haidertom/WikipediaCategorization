{"id": "224094", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=224094", "title": "Adbusters", "text": "Adbusters\n\nThe Adbusters Media Foundation is a Canadian-based not-for-profit, pro-environment organization founded in 1989 by Kalle Lasn and Bill Schmalz in Vancouver, British Columbia. Adbusters describes itself as \"a global network of artists, activists, writers, pranksters, students, educators and entrepreneurs who want to advance the new social activist movement of the information age.\"\n\nCharacterized by some as anti-capitalist or opposed to capitalism, it publishes the reader-supported, advertising-free \"Adbusters\", an activist magazine with an international circulation of 120,000 by the late 2000s devoted to challenging consumerism. Past and present contributors to the magazine include Jonathan Barnbrook, Morris Berman, Brendan Connell, Simon Critchley, David Graeber, Michael Hardt, Chris Hedges, Bill McKibben, Jim Munroe, David Orrell, Douglas Rushkoff, Matt Taibbi, Slavoj Žižek, and others.\n\nAdbusters has launched numerous international campaigns, including Buy Nothing Day, TV Turnoff Week and Occupy Wall Street, and is known for their \"subvertisements\" that spoof popular advertisements. In English, Adbusters has bi-monthly American, Canadian, Australian, UK and International editions of each issue. Adbusters's sister organizations include \"Résistance à l'Aggression Publicitaire\" and \"Casseurs de Pub\" in France, \"Adbusters Norge\" in Norway, \"Adbusters Sverige\" in Sweden and \"Culture Jammers\" in Japan.\n\nAdbusters was founded in 1989 by Kalle Lasn and Bill Schmalz, a duo of award-winning documentary filmmakers living in Vancouver. Since the early 1980s, Lasn had been making films that explored the spiritual and cultural lessons the West could learn from the Japanese experience with capitalism.\n\nIn 1988, the \"British Columbia Council of Forest Industries,\" the \"voice\" of the logging industry, was facing tremendous public pressure from a growing environmentalist movement. The logging industry fought back with a television ad campaign called \"Forests Forever.\" It was an early example of greenwashing: shots of happy children, workers and animals with a kindly, trustworthy sounding narrator who assured the public that the logging industry was protecting the forest.\n\nLasn and Shmalz, outraged by the use of the public airwaves to deliver what they felt was deceptive anti-environmentalist propaganda, responded by producing the \"Talking Rainforest\" anti-ad in which an old-growth tree explains to a sapling that \"a tree farm is not a forest.\" But the duo proved to be unable to buy airtime on the same stations that had aired the forest-industry ad. According to a former Adbusters employee, \"The CBC's reaction to the proposed television commercial created the real flash point for the Media Foundation. It seemed that Lasn and Schmaltz's commercial was too controversial to air on the CBC. An environmental message that challenged the large forestry companies was considered 'advocacy advertising' and was disallowed, even though the 'informational' messages that glorified clearcutting were OK.\"\n\nThe foundation was born out of their belief that citizens do not have the same access to the information flows as corporations. One of the foundation's key campaigns continues to be the Media Carta, a \"movement to enshrine The Right to Communicate in the constitutions of all free nations, and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\"\n\nThe foundation notes that concern over the flow of information goes beyond the desire to protect democratic transparency, freedom of speech or the public's access to the airwaves. Although it supports these causes, the foundation instead situates the battle of the mind at the center of its political agenda. Fighting to counter pro-consumerist advertising is done not as a means to an end, but as the end in itself. This shift in emphasis is a crucial element of mental environmentalism.\n\nThe subtitle of \"Adbusters\" magazine is \"The Journal of the Mental Environment.\"\n\nIn a 1996 interview, Kalle Lasn explained the foundation's goal:\nWhat we're trying to do is pioneer a new form of social activism using all the power of the mass media to sell ideas, rather than products. We're motivated by a kind of 'greenthink' that comes from the environmental movement and isn't mired in the old ideology of the left and right. Instead, we take the environmental ethic into the mental ethic, trying to clean up the toxic areas of our minds.\n\nYou can't recycle and be a good environmental citizen, then watch four hours of television and get consumption messages pumped at you.\n\nAdbusters describes itself as anti-advertising: it blames advertising for playing a central role in creating and maintaining consumer culture. This argument is based on the belief that the advertising industry goes to great effort and expense to associate desire and identity with commodities. Adbusters believes that advertising has unjustly \"colonized\" public, discursive and psychic spaces, by appearing in movies, sports and even schools, so as to permeate modern culture. Adbusters's stated goals include combating the negative effects of advertising and empowering its readers to regain control of culture, encouraging them to ask \"Are we consumers and citizens?\"\n\nSince \"Adbusters\" concludes that advertising conditions people to look to external sources, to define their own personal identities, the magazine advocates a \"natural and authentic self apart from the consumer society\". The magazine aims to provoke anti-consumerist feelings. By juxtaposing text and images, the magazine attempts to create a means of raising awareness and getting its message out to people that is both aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.\n\nActivism also takes many other forms such as corporate boycotts and ‘art as protest', often incorporating humor. This includes billboard modifications, google bombing, flash mobs and fake parking tickets for SUVs. A popular example of cultural jamming is the distortion of Tiger Woods' smile into the form of the Nike swoosh, calling viewers to question how they view Woods' persona as a product. Adbusters calls it \"trickle up\" activism, and encourages its readers to do these activities by honoring culture jamming work in the magazine. In the September/October 2001 \"Graphic Anarchy\" issue, Adbusters were culture jammed themselves in a manner of speaking: they hailed the work of Swiss graphic designer Ernst Bettler as \"one of the greatest design interventions on record\", unaware that Bettler's story was an elaborate hoax.\n\n\"Media Carta\" is a charter challenging the corporate control of the public airwaves and means of communication. The goal is to \"make the public airwaves truly public, and not just a corporate domain.\" Over 30,000 people have signed the document voicing their desire to reclaim the public space.\nOn 13 September 2004, Adbusters filed a lawsuit against six major Canadian television broadcasters (including CanWest Global, Bell Globemedia, CHUM Ltd., and the CBC) for refusing to air Adbusters videos in the television commercial spots that Adbusters attempted to purchase. Most broadcasters refused the commercials, fearing the ads would upset other advertisers as well as violate business principles by \"contaminating the purity of media environments designed exclusively for communicating commercial messages\". The lawsuit claims that Adbusters' freedom of expression was unjustly limited by the refusals. Adbusters believes the public deserves a right to be presented with viewpoints that differ from the standard. Under Section 3 of the Broadcasting Act, television is a public space allowing ordinary citizens to possess the same rights as advertising agencies and corporations to purchase 30 seconds of airtime from major broadcasters. There has been talk that if Adbusters wins in Canadian court, they will file similar lawsuits against major U.S. broadcasters that also refused the advertisements. CNN is the only network that has allowed several of the foundation's commercials to run.\n\nOn 3 April 2009, the British Columbia Court of Appeal unanimously overturned a BC Supreme Court ruling that had dismissed the case in February 2008. The court granted Adbusters the ability to sue the Canadian Broadcasting Company and CanWest Global, the corporations that originally refused to air the anti-car ad \"Autosaurus\". The ruling represents a victory for Adbusters, but it is the first step of their intended goal, essentially opening the door for future legal action against the media conglomerates. Kalle Lasn declared the ruling a success and said, \"After twenty years of legal struggle, the courts have finally given us permission to take on the media corporations and hold them up to public scrutiny.\"\n\nIn April 2009, the foundation transformed TV Turnoff Week into Digital Detox Week, encouraging citizens to spend seven days \"unplugged\" without any of electronic devices such as video-game systems and computers.\n\nThe \"One Flag\" competition encouraged readers to create a flag that symbolized \"global citizenship\", without using language or commonly known symbols.\n\nCulture jamming is the primary means through which Adbusters challenges consumerism. The magazine was described by Joseph Heath and Andrew Potter in their book \"The Rebel Sell\" as \"the flagship publication of the culture jamming movement.\" Culture jamming is heavily influenced by the Situationist International and the tactic of \"détournement\". The goal is to interrupt the normal consumerist experience in order to reveal the underlying ideology of an advertisement, media message, or consumer artifact. Adbusters believe large corporations control mainstream media and the flow of information, and culture jamming aims to challenge this as a form of protest. The term \"jam\" contains more than one meaning, including improvising, by re-situating an image or idea already in existence, and interrupting, by attempting to stop the workings of a machine.\n\nAs already noted, the foundation's approach to culture jamming has its roots in the activities of the situationists and in particular their concept of \"détournement\". This involves the \"turning around\" of received messages so that they communicate meanings at variance with their original intention. Situationists argue that consumerism creates \"a limitless artificiality\", blurring the lines of reality and detracting from the essence of human experience. In the \"culture jamming\" context, \"détournement\" means taking symbols, logos and slogans that are considered to be the vehicles upon which the \"dominant discourse\" of \"late capitalism\" is communicated and changing them – frequently in significant but minor ways – to subvert the \"monologue of the ruling order\" [Debord].\n\nThe foundation's activism links grassroots efforts with environmental and social concerns, hoping followers will \"reconstruct [their] self through nonconsumption strategies.\" The foundation is particularly well known for its culture jamming campaigns, and the magazine often features photographs of politically motivated billboard or advertisement vandalism sent in by readers. The campaigns attempt to remove people from the \"isolated reality of consumer comforts\".\n\nIn 2004, the foundation began selling vegan, indy shoes. The name and logo are \"open-source\"; in other words, unencumbered by private trademarks. Attached to each pair was a \"Rethink the Cool\" leaflet, inviting wearers to join a movement, and two spots – one for drawing their own logos and another on the toe for \"kicking corporate ass.\"\n\nThere are three versions of the Blackspot Sneaker. The V1 is designed to resemble the Nike-owned Converse Chuck Taylor All-Stars (Nike bought Converse in 2003). There is also a V1 in \"fiery red.\"\n\nThe V2 is designed by Canadian shoe designer John Fluevog. It is made from organic hemp and recycled car tires.\n\nAfter an extensive search for anti-sweatshop manufacturers around the world, Adbusters found a small union shop in Portugal. The sale of more than twenty-five thousand pairs through an alternative distribution network is an example of Western consumer activism marketing.\n\nAdbusters describes its goals vis-à-vis Blackspot as follows:\n\nHeath and Potter's \"The Rebel Sell\", which is critical of Adbusters, claimed that the blackspot shoe's existence proves that \"no rational person could possibly believe that there is any tension between 'mainstream' and 'alternative' culture.\"\n\nIn the June 2008 cover story of \"BusinessWeek Small Business Magazine\", the Blackspot campaign was among three profiled in a piece focusing on \"antipreneurs.\" Two advertising executives were asked to review the campaign for the article's \"Ask the Experts\" sidebar. Brian Martin of \"Brand Connections\" and Dave Weaver of TM Advertising both gave the campaign favorable reviews.\n\nMartin noted that Blackspot was effectively telling consumers, \"We know we are marketing to you, and you are as good as we are at this, and your opinion matters,\" while Weaver stated that \"This is not a call to sales of the shoe so much as it is a call to participate in the community of Adbusters by buying the shoe.\"\n\nIn mid-2011, Adbusters Foundation proposed a peaceful occupation of Wall Street to protest corporate influence on democracy, a growing disparity in wealth, and the absence of legal repercussions behind the recent global financial crisis. They sought to combine the symbolic location of the 2011 protests in Tahrir Square with the consensus decision making of the 2011 Spanish protests. Adbusters' senior editor Micah White said they had suggested the protest via their email list and it \"was spontaneously taken up by all the people of the world.\" Adbusters' website said that from their \"one simple demand—a presidential commission to separate money from politics\" they would \"start setting the agenda for a new America.\" They promoted the protest with a poster featuring a dancer atop Wall Street's iconic Charging Bull. On 13 July 2011 it was the staff at the magazine that created the #OCCUPYWALLSTREET hashtag on Twitter.\n\nWhile the movement was started by Adbusters, the group does not control the movement, and it has since grown worldwide.\n\nThe foundation has been criticized for having a style and form that are too similar to the media and commercial product that adbusters attack, that its high gloss design makes the magazine too expensive, and that a style over substance approach is used to mask sub-par content.\n\nHeath and Potter posit that the more alternative or subversive the foundation feels, the more appealing the Blackspot sneaker will become to the mainstream market. They believe consumers seek exclusivity and social distinction and have argued that the mainstream market seeks the very same brand of individuality that the foundation promotes; thus they see the foundation as promoting capitalist values.\n\nThe Blackspot Shoes campaign has stirred heated debate, as Adbusters admits to using the same marketing technique which it denounces other companies for using by originally purchasing much advertising space for the shoe.\n\nAdbusters launched a legal challenge in 1995. A second in 2004 was against CBC, CTV, CanWest and CHUM, for refusing to air anti-consumerism commercials, therefore infringing on the staff's freedom of speech. In one case, a CHUM representative is quoted as saying the ads \"were so blatantly against television and that is our entire core business. You know we can't be selling our airtime and then telling people to turn their TVs off.\"\n\nIn March 2004, \"Adbusters\" was accused of antisemitism after running an article titled \"Why won't anyone say they are Jewish?\" The article compiled a list of neoconservative supporters within the Bush Administration and marked the names of those it perceived as Jewish with a black dot. It questioned why, given Israel's role, the political implications of this Jewish neoconservative influence on U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East were not a subject of debate.\n\nIn October 2010, Shopper's Drug Mart pulled \"Adbusters\" off of its shelves after a photo montage comparing the Gaza Strip to the Warsaw ghetto was featured in an article critiquing Israel's embargo of Gaza. The Canadian Jewish Congress rallied to have the magazine blacklisted from bookstores, accusing \"Adbusters\" of trivializing the Holocaust and of antisemitism. In response \"Adbusters\" argued that the charge of antisemitism was being used to silence what it considered legitimate criticism of Israeli policies.\n\nSome critics claim that culture jamming does little to incite real difference. Others declare the movement an easy way for upper- and middle-class citizens to feel empowered by engaging in activism that bears no personal cost, such as the campaign \"Buy Nothing Day\". These critics feel a need for \"resistance against the causes of capitalist exploitation, not its symptoms\".\n\nIn 1999, Adbusters won the award for National Magazine of the Year in Canada.\n\n\n"}

Currently, the ACCJ has members that represent over 1,000 companies with offices located in Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka. Working closely with the governments of the United States and Japan, business organizations and others, the ACCJ actively promotes activities that help achieve its mission of further developing commerce between the United States and Japan.\n\nThe ACCJ was established in 1948 by representatives of 40 American companies. Originally, the ACCJ had six committees and nine board members.\n\nThe ACCJ claims to be Japan’s most influential foreign business organization, and serves as the primary forum for the foreign business community in Japan to identify and pursue shared interests and goals. There are more than sixty Chamber committees, subcommittees, task forces, and advisory councils that cover such diverse areas as: financial services, corporate social responsibility, marketing, independent business, healthcare services, e-business, transportation and logistics, legal services, the travel industry, and human resource management.\n\nThe ACCJ committees combined hold over 500 programs annually, and these events are exclusively attended by ACCJ members and their accompanied guests. The backbone of the annual agenda is hundreds of engagements with leading experts and shapers of policy and business trends in Japan. Speakers are drawn from the ranks of global business leaders, top U.S. and Japanese government officials, industry experts, scholars and pop culture icons. Former speakers Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe; JP Morgan Japan Director of Research, Jesper Koll; Rakuten Inc CEO, Hiroshi Mikitani; General Electric CEO, Jeffrey R. Immelt; U.S. Chamber of Commerce CEO, Tom J. Donohue; former Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger; U.S. Department of Energy Secretary, Steven Chu; Transportation Secretary, Ray LaHood; Homeland Security Secretary, Janet Napolitano; U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy, and many others have chosen the ACCJ as their forum for addressing Japan’s international business community.\n\nAs a key stakeholder in the commercial relationship between the United States and Japan, the ACCJ works to influence the discussions that frame policy in both countries. The ACCJ issues its official positions on policy issues in Viewpoint position papers, white papers, public comments and other reports. The ultimate goal of these policy positions and the advocacy carried out to communicate them and promote their implementation is to further the mission of the ACCJ to improve the business environment in Japan for Chamber members.\n\nLeadership positions within the ACCJ are held by elected officials who represent top-level Japanese businesspeople and expats in Japan from the U.S. and around the globe.\n\n"}
{"id": "20723531", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=20723531", "title": "Application for employment", "text": "Application for employment\n\nAn application for employment is a standard business document which is prepared with questions deemed relevant by an employer in order for the employer to determine the best candidate to be given the responsibility of fulfilling the work needs of the company. Most companies provide such forms to anyone upon request at which point it becomes the responsibility of the applicant to complete the form and returning it to the employer at will for consideration. The completed and returned document notifies the company of the applicants availability and desire to be employed and their qualifications and background so a determination can be made as to which candidate should be hired.\n\nFrom the employer's perspective, the application serves a number of purposes. These vary depending on the nature of the job and the preferences of the person responsible for hiring, as \"each organization should have an application form that reflects its own environment\". At a minimum, an application usually requires the applicant to provide information sufficient to demonstrate that he or she is legally permitted to be employed. The typical application also requires the applicant to provide information regarding relevant skills, education, and experience (previous employment or volunteer work). The application itself is a minor test of the applicant's literacy, penmanship, and communication skills - a careless job applicant might disqualify themselves with a poorly filled-out application.\n\nThe application may also require the applicant to disclose any criminal record, and to provide information sufficient to enable the employer to conduct an appropriate background check. For a business that employs workers on a part-time basis, the application may inquire as to the applicant's specific times and days of availability, and preferences in this regard. It is important to note, however, that an employer may be prohibited from asking applicants about characteristics that are not relevant to the job, such as their political view or sexual orientation.\n\nFor white collar jobs, particularly those requiring communication skills, the employer will typically require applicants to accompany the form with a cover letter and a résumé. However, even employers who accept a cover letter and résumé will frequently also require the applicant to complete a form application, as the other documents may neglect to mention details of importance to the employers. In some instances, an application is effectively used to dissuade \"walk-in\" applicants, serving as a barrier between the applicant and a job interview with the person with the authority to hire.\n\nFor many businesses, applications for employment can be filled out online, and do not have to be submitted in person. However, it is still recommended that applicants bring a printed copy of their application to an interview.\n\nApplication blanks are the second most common hiring instrument next to personal interviews. Companies will occasionally use two types of application blanks, short and long. They both help companies with initial screening and the longer form can be used for other purposes as well. The answers that applicants choose to submit are helpful to the company because they can become an interview question for that applicant at a future date.\n\nThe employment application is not a standardized form so every company may create its own as long as regulations set by the government are adhered. \n\nApplications usually ask the applicant at the minimum for their name, phone number, and address. In addition, applications also ask for previous employment information, educational background, emergency contacts, references, as well as any special skills the applicant might have.\n\nThe three categories application fields are very useful for discovering are; physical characteristics, experience, and environmental factors.\n\nIf the company has a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ) to ask regarding a physical condition, they may ask questions about it, for example:\n\nExperience requirements can be separated into two groups on an application, work experience and educational background. Educational background is important to companies because by evaluating applicants' performance in school tells them what their personality is like as well as their intelligence. Work experience is important to companies because it will inform the company if the applicant meets their requirements. Companies are usually interested when applicants were unemployed and when/why the applicant left their previous job.\n\nCompanies are interested in the applicant's social environment because it can inform them of their personality, interests, and qualities. If they are extremely active within an organization, that may demonstrate their ability to communicate well with others. Being in management may demonstrate their leadership ability as well as their determination and so on.\n\nCustoms vary internationally when it comes to the inclusion or non-inclusion of a photograph of the applicant. In the English-speaking countries, notably the United States, this is not customary, and books or websites giving recommendations about how to design an application typically advise against it unless explicitly requested by the employer. In other countries, for instance Germany, the inclusion of a photograph of the applicant is still common, and many employers would consider an application incomplete without it.\n\nIn France, the requires companies with more than 50 employees to request an anonymous application (\"\").\n\nThe job application is called \"Bewerbung\" in Germany and usually consists of three parts, such as the \"Anschreiben\", the \"Lebenslauf\" and the \"Zeugnisse\". \"Anschreiben\" is the German word for Cover Letter and aims at the same goal: convincing the employer to submit an invitation for a job interview. It is essential to work with the paper size DIN A4 and to stay with a length of one single page. The \"Anschreiben\" must be signed by hand and accompanied by a \"Lebenslauf\", the Curriculum Vitae, and \"Zeugnisse\" as copies of relevant reference documents. The \"Lebenslauf\" is of an anti-chronological structure and should give information on work experience, education and professional training as well as on applicant's skills. In Germany, the \"Lebenslauf\" – respectively the Curriculum Vitae – usually includes a photograph called \"Bewerbungsfoto\". Some employers, mainly governmental organisations, deliberately neglect the photograph to ensure a higher degree of objectivity in the course of assessment procedures. A length of two pages is to be aimed at when generating the \"Lebenslauf\". In general, there are two options of submitting a job application in Germany: a job application folder (\"Bewerbungsmappe\") or online (\"Onlinebewerbung\"). According to a study, the \"Onlinebewerbung\" was more favored in Germany than the \"Bewerbungsmappe\" by 2012. Presumably, this development will persist..\n\nThe CV is the most important part of the application and should not be longer than two to three pages. It is divided into three areas:\n\nin chronological order\n\nin anti-chronological order\n\nThe application letter (La Lettera di accompagnamento al curriculum) will be taken relatively short, polite and formal in Italian applications. Long versions and extensively explained motivations, as well as photos and copies of certificates shall be presented only at the interview.\n\nIn Spain, the application consists of two parts: the cover letter (\"Carta de Candidatura\") and the CV. No work or training certificates are attached. The cover letter should contain information on the motivation and drafted shortly. The CV should be structured in a tabular form. In Spain, multiple job interviews in the same company are common.\n\nJob applications are known to be used by hackers to get employees to open attachments or links or connect USB sticks with malware. As companies typically have more financial resources than private individuals they are often a target of cyberextortion − so called ransomware. Ransomware such as \"Petya\" and \"GoldenEye\" were found to make use of job applications. Cyberespionage and attacks on critical infrastructure-related companies may be other reasons for such attacks and other than ransomware attacks may leave employees in the dark about their computer or network infection. The best method for mitigating such risks would be to have the HR department use a separate computer for job applications that is entirely disconnected from the internal network, on which no confidential or valuable information is stored and to which no portable devices such as USB sticks that may get connected to other computers of the company are connected.\n\n\n"}

Regardless, a Bachelor of Commerce degree requires students to take the majority of their courses in business-related subjects, including the aside, among others.\n\nFor a comparison with other business degrees, see Business education#Undergraduate education.\n\nThe Honours Bachelor of Commerce (B.Com. (Hons) or B.Comm. (Hons) or H.B.Com. or H.B.Comm.) is further advanced. It may consist of a four-year program or of a one-year program taken subsequent to a three-year Bachelor's degree. The degree requires additional academic courses to be completed with higher academic performance standards and may also require a researched thesis component; the one-year program is often focused exclusively on a single subject-area.\n\nThe Honours Bachelor of Commerce degree often serves as an abridgement (or entry requirement) between the undergraduate program and postgraduate programs, including the Master of Commerce (M.Com. or M.Comm.) and the Master of Business Administration (MBA) degrees.\n\nThe curriculum generally lasts three years in Australia, New Zealand, India, Malta, South Africa, some parts of Canada and Hong Kong. The curriculum requires four years of study in the Republic of Ireland, the majority of Canada, Ghana, the Philippines and the Netherlands. In Nepal, the duration of the program can be three years.\n\nIn South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and some universities in India, the B.Com. (Hons) degree is considered an additional postgraduate qualification, whereas in Malta, an additional year of study is not considered a postgraduate qualification. In Pakistan, the B.Com. degree lasts two years, the B.Com. (Hons) degree lasts three years, and a four-year program leads to the BS (Hons) Commerce degree.\n\nThe Bachelor of Commerce degree was first offered at the University of Birmingham. The University's School of Commerce was founded by William Ashley, an Englishman from Oxford University, who was the first professor of Political Economy and Constitutional History in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Toronto. Ashley left Toronto in 1892, spent a few years at Harvard University, and then went back to England to the new University of Birmingham where he founded the School of Commerce. Ashley began the program which was the forerunner of many other B.Com. degree programs throughout the British Empire.\n\nEighteenth-century economists had divided the English economy into three sectors: agriculture, manufacturing, and commerce. Commerce included the transportation, marketing and financing of goods. The Birmingham program in Commerce included economic geography, economic history, general economics, modern languages, and accountancy.\n\nBachelor of Business & Information Technology (BBIT) http://www.ibitpu.edu.pk/\n"}
{"id": "10932276", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10932276", "title": "Borf", "text": "Borf\n\nBorf was a graffiti campaign seen in and around Washington, D.C. during 2004 and 2005, carried out by John Tsombikos while studying at the Corcoran College of Art and Design. This four letter word was ubiquitous around the Northwest quadrant of Washington, and ranged from simple tagging to complete sentences to two-color stencils to the massive defacement on an overhead exit sign from the Theodore Roosevelt Bridge to Constitution Avenue. Tsombikos was arrested on July 13, 2005 after tips led police to his latest tag.\n\nOne of the most visible tags was the \"BUSH HATES BORF\" message painted above other graffiti on the back wall of the Vision Lighting Building and visible from the Metro Red Line near the Takoma Metro station. This message was later replaced by a message saying \"OBAMA HATES BORF\" in early 2009. The graffiti was also reported to have appeared in New York City, San Francisco, Raleigh, North Carolina, Rome, Italy, and elsewhere.\n\nIn 2009, director Paris Bustillos created a documentary film about the campaign entitled \"Borf!\".\n\nThe campaign attracted widespread attention without first explaining its motivations. According to Tsombikos and subsequent Borf communiqués, both the nickname \"Borf\" and the Borf face belonged to Bobby Fisher, a close friend of Tsombikos' who had committed suicide. In a video shown on July 29, 2006, the Borf Brigade – the group claiming responsibility for the graffiti spree – asserted that capitalism and the culture of aesthetics created alienation and feelings of worthlessness that contributed to the 16-year-old's suicide. The group said that they used other peoples' property to commemorate and pay homage to their deceased friend. The graffiti usually had overtones of anti-authority sentiments and youth liberation.\n\nApproximately four months after his arrest, Tsombikos appeared before the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. His paint-stained coat, which resembled one that he wore in Libby Copeland's July 14 \"Washington Post\" article (published after his arrest), was declared evidence by the judge and handed over to the prosecution.\n\nOn December 12, 2005, Tsombikos agreed to plead guilty to one count of felony destruction of property. He also agreed to perform community service (cleaning up graffiti) and to pay $12,000 in restitution. Judge Leibovitz ordered him to stay out of the District except for court appearances and classes at the Corcoran College of Art and Design.\n\nOn February 9, 2006, Tsombikos was sentenced to 30 days in the D.C. jail, with an additional 17 months suspended, as well as the community service and restitution specified in his plea agreement. At his sentencing, the judge said, \"You profess to despise rich people. You profess to despise the faceless, nameless forms of government that oppress. That's what you've become. That's what you are. You're a rich kid who comes into Washington and defaces property because you feel like it. It's not fair. It's not right.\"\n\nAt a Dupont Circle event after Borf's arrest, young people distributed spray paint and anarchist pamphlets. The following was distributed as a \"communiqué\" at the event:\n\nOn July 29, 2006, a group of young people calling themselves the \"Borf Brigade\" held a march in the Shaw neighborhood of Washington, and projected a \"video communiqué\" on a wall in which a young woman wearing a Zapatista-style face mask read a statement labeling Tsombikos a \"minor Borfist\" and announced that he had been \"purged\" from the group. The video also said,\n\nIn April 2007, wheat-pasted posters announcing a \"BORF SHOW\" slated for the weekends of May 18–20 and May 25–27 began appearing around Washington. The location was \"The Bobby Fisher Memorial Building\" at 1644 North Capitol Street NW.\n\nThe show, entitled \"Consolation of Ruin\" and sponsored by philanthropist Chuck Burgundy, featured two floors of oil paintings, screen prints, etchings, installations, and video, all for sale in an effort to pay for Tsombikos' $12,000 restitution. One installation (a direct reference to Banksy's \"elephant in the room\" piece) was of a male figure hanging from a belt from the ceiling and painted to match the wallpaper designs on the wall, camouflaging the lifeless figure. A number of the original stencils used in the graffiti campaign were on display.\n\nAfter the Borf show, the Bobby Fisher Memorial Building served as a youth-oriented space for music and art until its closing in July 2008.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "57026507", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=57026507", "title": "Budtender", "text": "Budtender\n\nA budtender is a title of a staff member who works within a dispensary or store where medical or recreational cannabis is sold. Their job is to offer suggestions to customers, answer questions, handle products and showcase products being sold.\n\nBudtender, a term recognized by Merriam-Webster as of March 2018, is a portmanteau that combines the word bartender and bud. Like a bartender, budtenders serve customers within a licensed establishment while the word bud is referring to the dried flower tops of Cannabis used for consumption.\n\nThe first budtenders gained knowledge through Cannabis farmers, extraction technicians, edible chefs and other cannabis experts. In the early days of legalized medical cannabis no prior schooling was needed to work as a budtender. As of 2017, no license or certification is needed to be a budtender. Because Cannabis is still illegal on a national level, no national licensing standards have been implemented. Most budtenders are self taught cannabis connoisseurs while some are trained formally. Training institutions include: Green CulturED, The Cannabis Training Institute, and Cannabis Trainers each with their own curriculum. For Green Cultured the total cost of the certifications is $119.00, Cannabis Training Institute is $299.00 for the program. These institutions offer certifications in completed courses with subjects like Cannabis concentrates, Cannabis consumption, growing cannabis, cannabis laws and many more. Some courses are offered online while some are workshop that require physical attendance.\n\nBudtenders have to be qualified to work in a dispensary and must have a wide range of cannabis knowledge. In order to provide customers with a positive experience at a dispensary, budtenders need to demonstrate their knowledge of strains, cannabis products and medical use. They need to know the characteristics of each strain of cannabis they sell, based on their taste, smell and effects. If a customer were to ask about a specific strain that the dispensary does not have, a budtender should be able to recommend a similar strain with their broad understanding of cannabis in terms of the attributes of the customer’s original request. A budtender should also be able to adhere to the necessity for a medical marijuana user. Their ability to understand the medical circumstances of certain strains is critical and essential for the safety of the customer. Budtenders may stay aware of cannabis trends is by checking social media and industry blogs.\n\nSince budtenders work one-on-one with customers, it is essential that they provide a welcoming environment for them. A budtender's job is to provide and share their knowledge of cannabis with a customer, have the ability to teach those who have never tried cannabis before and to provide insight to new trends or strains. Budtenders also sometimes share stories in order to market to a customer and also to create a friendlier environment. These stories are meant to provide apprehension of what a customer might feel or do when they use a certain type of cannabis. However, budtenders are not recommended to push their products by telling fake stories and experiences in order to get a customer to buy something; this is considered bad customer service within the industry. Also, budtenders are commended when they have good hygiene when addressing or working with customers. Having clean hands and tidy attire are critical when a budtender works with a customer. Budtenders are also recommended to use tongs or gloves when pulling out a sample from a jar instead of reaching in with their bare hands. Finally, budtenders are also highly recommended to express a sense of passion for their product in order to spark interest from a customer.\n\nBecause the distribution and use of marijuana is illegal on a federal level, budtending salaries vary per state. However as of 2014, the general hourly income for a budtender is $11–12 per hour. One of the perks of being a budtender is that many dispensaries give discounts of their product to their employees. Budtenders will often get tips from their customers, and sometimes a yearly salary (with tips) can be from $31,000–$42,000.\n\nIn the United States, there are 9 states that have legalized recreational marijuana, and another 21 states that have made medical marijuana legal. Budtenders in these states are held to state legislation, and must comply with state law.\n\nOregon, one of the 9 recreational marijuana states, is regulated by the Oregon Liquor Control Commission (OLCC), and require all budtenders to be at least 21 years or older to obtain a license and or permit. Whether it be production or processing purposes, any budtender who actively handles marijuana, must have a permit to secure or sell marijuana items. Having these permits is necessary under Oregon law, however; permits are only valid for five years from the date issued by the OLCC. All permits under the commission grant an employee access to any licensed marijuana business in the state. Being a fairly regulated business, all budtenders are required by state law to have their worker permits readily available at any time while working, in case of immediate inspection by OLCC regulatory staff or enforcement officer. It is advised to keep the permit on one's self when working, for this immediate reason. If a budtender who possesses a legal permit were to be convicted by the state for misdemeanor or felony, they have 10 days to submit a written notification to the Commission. No permit is transferable; the permit to sell recreational marijuana belongs to the permittee. The only applicable license type that allows the sale of marijuana items to a consumer is the retail license. Every retailer must verify the age of every customer, for any and all purchases, and can only sell between the hours of 7am-10pm. A budtender cannot offer free samples to customers, give free marijuana items, or provide any form of discount if the sale is inline with the sale of other items. Retailers may only receive marijuana products from the OLCC licensed producers, processors, and wholesalers.\n"}

The US was the world's third-largest producer of cement, after China and India. The US cement industry includes 99 cement mills in 34 states, plus two plants in Puerto Rico. The industry directly employed 10,000 workers in 2015. Ten percent of the cement used in the United States in 2015 was imported.\n\nThe types and amounts of cement produced in 2015 were:\n\nCement production is predominantly portland cement, which is mostly used in concrete. Cement for concrete is an essential material for construction, and demand is a function of construction spending. Single-family residential construction is considered only moderately cement-intensive; multifamily residential somewhat more intensive. Nonresidential construction and government construction projects are considered the most cement-intensive.\n\nIn 2013, 70.8 percent of portland cement was sold as ready-mix concrete, such as is delivered in cement-mixer trucks. 11.5 percent was sold dry to contractors and construction materials stores; 11.3 percent was sold to manufacturers of concrete products; 4.6 percent was sold for oil and gas wells, and 1.8 percent was sold to government agencies and others.\n\nBecause cement is a bulk commodity, transportation can be a significant part of the cost. To minimize transportation costs, cement plants are ideally located close to the market, with access to efficient transportation such as ship or railroad. Most cement plants are located close to the limestone deposits.\n\nThirty-four states have cement manufacturing plants. In 2013, the five leading cement-producing states, in descending order, were: Texas, California, Missouri, Florida, and Alabama. Together, the five accounted for almost half of US cement production. The list of top five cement-consuming states is similar: Texas, California, Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania.\n\nIn 2015, about 10 percent of US cement consumption came from imports. The largest sources of US cement imports were Canada and Greece.\n\nIn 2013, the top producers of portland cement in the US were:\n\n\nIn 2013, the top 5 companies produced 54 percent of US portland cement; the top 10 companies produced 78 percent.\n\nPortland cement is a complex mixture, mostly calcium, with admixtures of aluminium, silica, and iron. The choice of source materials depends on local availability. The calcium is usually supplied by limestone, but sometimes shell or coral. Slightly clayey limestones are preferable, because they already contain the necessary aluminium. Cement cannot contain more than 5 percent magnesium, so the limestone must be low in magnesium.\n\nRaw materials used in US cement production, 2013 \nEnergy sources used in the US to manufacture cement in 2013 were:\n\nThe cement industry has both positive and negative effects on the environment.\n\nCement manufacture is a source of the following airborne contaminants: particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide.\n\nCement production releases carbon dioxide by sintering limestone or shells. It is also very energy-intensive, with the result that the cement industry is a large emitter of carbon dioxide.\n\nThe high temperatures of cement kilns, the ability of concrete to incorporate different materials, and the stable and nonreactive nature of the concrete end product, all make cement kilns a desirable method for the destruction of hazardous waste. \n\nHazardous wastes efficiently destroyed by cement kilns include chlorinated solvents (methylene chloride, trichloroethylene, trichloromethane, trichloroethane, carbon tetrachloride), Freon-113, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dioxin, waste oil, and used hydrocarbon solvents. Whatever undesirable materials are not destroyed are locked in the finished concrete, a stable material with low permeability. Hydrocarbon waste and used tires contribute to the kiln heat, and reduces fuel use. \n\nIn addition to destruction of hazardous waste, waste materials from other industries, such as slag and fly ash, are commonly incorporated into cement, eliminating the need to landfill the waste. The ability of cement to incorporate different materials allows contaminated soil to be added to the feed, eliminating the need to take the material to a hazardous waste landfill. The US EPA estimated that in 2014, 13.1 million tons of coal fly ash, which otherwise would have to be landfilled, was beneficially used in cement. In addition, the use of fly ash improves the strength and durability of concrete\n"}

Cortex is a 200-acre hub of technology and biological science research, development, and commercialization. It anchors St. Louis startup technology companies in the city.\n\nCortex states that once their master plan is completed, there will be $2.3 billion of construction and more than 4.5 million square feet of mixed-use development, including 13,000 jobs in technology.\n\nThe current initiative for Cortex is called Cortex 3.0, $170 million expansion of Cortex to be completed in fall 2018.\n\nIn 1998, William Henry Danforth, whom 3 years prior had retired as chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis, recognized that the region was not building upon its core strengths in medicine and plant sciences. He formed the Coalition for Plant and Life Sciences, now known as BioSTL.\n\nThis eventually led to the creation of the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center.\n\nComing off that successful project, William Henry Danforth and John Dubinsky, CEO of financial consulting firm Westmoreland Associates and the eventual chairman of the Cortex board, went to Cambridge to study Kendall Square, the most notable innovation district to see how the concept could be used in St. Louis.\n\nThe idea for Cortex came from the idea to create a district where companies could have a presence with access to talent, new technology, labs and intellectual property in order to innovate. The reason the Midtown neighborhood was selected for the location of Cortex is because the founding institutions are nearby and the Millenial Generation showed desire to live and work in the nearby urban areas.\n\nCortex as an organization was founded in 2002 by Washington University (WashU), BJC HealthCare (BJC), University of Missouri – St. Louis (UMSL), St. Louis University (SLU), and the Missouri Botanical Garden.\n\nCortex is a 501(c)3 tax-exempt organization.\n\nTo start the initial nonprofit to purchase land, members contributed $29 million USD as collateral for loans and purchasing of land. Washington University provided $15 million, BJC and SLU gave $5 million each, and UMSL gave $4 million USD.\n\nThe Cortex West Redevelopment Corporation was classified by the city under Missouri statute Chapter 353, as a master developer of the district. St. Louis Mayar Francis Slay gave Cortex the ability to redevelop the area broadly in the \"public interest\" with the tools of issuing tax abatements and using eminent domain if necessary, as has been documented as least two times.\n\nThe first hire by Cortex was CEO, Dennis Lower. Lower executed a plan called Cortex 2.0 and converted Cortex from a bioscience district to an open mixed-used district. Also part of Cortex 2.0 was a shift to startup technology companies.\n\nIn summer of 2014, Square, the payments company setup by St. Louis natives Jim McKelvey and Jack Dorsey opened offices at Cortex 4240.\n\nIn 2015, Ikea opened in Cortex.\n\nIn 2018, Microsoft opened its first midwest headquarters in Cortex building 4220.\n\nIn Fall 2018, once Venture Cafe Innovation Hall opens at the 4220 Building in Cortex, 23 City Blocks Hospitality Group's restaurant and cafe, The Chocolate Pig will open.\n\nIn June 2018, AON announced it was relocating 200 of its employees to the Cortex new 4220 building.\n\nThe Cortex Innovation Community is located in the Midtown neighborhood. It is over 200 acres of land and is situated nearby St. Louis’ Central West End and Forest Park neighborhoods. It is next to internationally known Washington University, its medical campus, St. Louis University, and Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Cortex is near cultural institutions including the Grand Center Arts District and the Missouri Botanical Garden. Cortex is next to Forest Park, which is home to the St. Louis Zoo, the St. Louis Art Museum, the St. Louis Science Center, the Missouri History Museum.\n\nOne of the primary companies building Cortex is Wexford. They have developed 3 properties and a total of 536,903 square feet.\n\n\nThe Center for Emerging Technologies (CET) is developing and establishing next-generation biomedical science and other advanced technology companies.\n\nBioGenerator discovers technologies and services with potential with an academic, research or entrepreneur to make a company.\n\nIn 2018, BioGenerator announced they will anchor the new Cortex biotech building.\n\nCambridge Innovation Center (CIC) provides services for startups and companies including innovations spaces and coworking.

Fluent in German, French and English, he began his career as an account executive at BDH Manchester (now TBWA) before moving to JWT in Paris and then Lowe Europe. Returning to London, he became the youngest board member at AMV BBDO.\n\nJones' career with Havas began in 1998, when he was appointed CEO of Euro RSCG Australia at age 32. After launching the network's first digital agency, he became president of global brands for Euro RSCG Worldwide and served as global brand director on Reckitt Benckiser. In 2004 he was promoted to CEO of Euro RSCG New York and in 2005 he succeeded Jim Heekin as CEO of Euro RSCG Worldwide and also taking on duties as directeur general of Havas. In 2006 Euro RSCG became the first agency to be named Global Agency of the Year by both Advertising Age and Campaign in the same year. In 2009, Jones added the title of CEO of Havas Worldwide, running all the creative, marketing and design companies throughout the Havas network of 300+ offices.\n\nFrom 2007–2010, Jones led the Euro RSCG team advising David Cameron and the UK Conservative Party.\n\nIn 2011, Jones expanded his position to encompass the entire Havas network, including Havas Media. and was named CEO of Havas.\n\nIn 2014 Jones left Havas and one year later he raised $350m and launched a new 'brandtech' group under the name \"You & Mr. Jones\". \n\nDavid Jones is creator of the \"Social Business Idea\"—a principle and practice that \"operates at the intersection of social responsibility and social media\" and \"aligns the goals of doing well and doing good.\" He cites the Dulux Let's Colour Project as an example.

Canada's 3,500 car dealers, which employ 140,000 people, told the federal and Ontario governments in mid-November they are at risk from the financial crisis; they are asking the national government to help out despite a record year of sales. Ottawa is considering providing financial aid to the Canadian subsidiaries of the Big Three, and possibly auto parts companies as well. The auto industry argued that loan guarantees and other help would try to save tens of thousands of Canadian jobs threatened by the sudden drop in North American car sales. Chrysler Canada has asked for $1 billion in aid, making it the only Canadian arm of the Big Three to make a specific dollar request.\n\nIndustry analyst Anthony Faria criticized the labor contracts that Canadian Auto Workers then-president Buzz Hargrove negotiated with the Big Three US automobile manufacturers in 2007, predicting that the subprime mortgage crisis and currency would hit Canadian auto production especially hard. Faria noted that UAW president Ron Gettelfinger agreed to have the UAW's \"all-in\" wage, benefit and pension costs drop from a high of $75.86 per hour in 2007 to an average of about $51 per hour starting in 2010. By comparison, the CAW's cost per hour was $77 in 2007 and will rise to over $80 per hour by the end of the new contract. Faria said that Gettelfinger went into negotiations \"with the right intention...Save jobs. The CAW strategy was to squeeze every dime out of them.\" Hargrove was said to have \"instilled backbone and an attitude that the union could always make the auto makers buckle at the bargaining table\".\n\nCurrent union president Ken Lewenza has argued that labor is not responsible for the bankruptcy crisis facing the Big Three automakers, saying that his members would not make concessions part of any taxpayer-funded bailout. \"We don't see this as us being the problem\", Lewenza said, adding he would \"absolutely not\" accept any further cuts after losing tens of thousands of jobs in recent years. \"We've suffered our share of pain.\" \nLawenza argued that the CAW agreed in 2007 to make concessions that will save the Big Three $900 million over three years.\n\nA spokesman for the Canadian Taxpayers Federation has criticized the CAW's \"no-concession\" stance, saying that it only serves to strengthen the opposition to a taxpayer-funded bailout for the struggling Detroit Three automakers. The CTF further pointed out that \"It is especially difficult to understand anyone asking for government help that refuses to do anything to help itself to begin with\", since they \"fail to realize they've existed at the substantial largesse of taxpayers for decades\". Kelly McParland, a columnist for the National Post, has suggested that \"if he won't give anything, he and his members are likely to lose everything.\" He also said that the problem facing the North American auto industry was borne equally by management and labor alike, criticizing labor for building up pay and benefits for themselves that was as unsustainable as it was enviable, while attacking management for its short-term strategy of selling gas-guzzling trucks and sales tactics (price cuts, rebates, free gas and cash-back schemes).\n\nThe CTF has opposed the proposed $3.5 CAD billion bailout for Canadian subsidiaries of the Big Three, saying that it was an unfair financial burden on the average Canadian, as well as another excuse for the Detroit automakers to postpone much needed change. The CTF noted that federal and provincial governments spent $782-million in the past five years on the Big Three, saying \"These have been a bottomless pit of requests for cash\". Lewenza disagreed, saying that the bailout should be seen by Canadians as a loan that will be paid back when the country's economy is prosperous again.\n\nOn December 20, the government of Canada and the province of Ontario offered $3.3 billion in loans to the auto industry. Under the plan GM will receive $3 billion and Chrysler will receive the rest. Ford only asked for a line of credit but will not be participating in the bailout.\n\nThe CAW negotiated a cost-cutting deal with General Motors Canada on March 8, 2009. The deal would extend the current contract for an additional year to September 2012, and preserves the current average assembly-worker base pay of about $34 an hour. It would eliminate a $1,700 annual \"special bonus,\" and reduce special paid absences or \"SPA days\" from two weeks to one week a year, while maintaining vacation entitlements which range up to six weeks a year for high-seniority workers. The deal also introduce payments by members toward their health benefits - $30 monthly per family for workers and $15 a month for pensioners. Lewenza said it also would trim by 35 per cent company contributions to union-provided programs such as child care and wellness programs. Lewenza called the package a \"major sacrifice.\" However, observers noted that the deal did not go far enough; DBRS analyst Kam Hon described it as \"not material.\" Automotive industry consultant Dennis DesRosiers said that General Motors had missed the chance to slash labour costs, pointing out that bankruptcy was a looming threat, Ottawa and Queen's Park demanded cuts to the labour bill as a condition of the bailout, and that the deficit to the pension fund would prevent the CAW from striking. He estimated the total hourly cost of a GM Canada worker, including benefits, is $75 to $78, and saying that \"they [GM] got six or seven\" when it should have been cut by $20. DesRosiers also said giving up cost-of-living increases is not significant when inflation is nearly non-existent and added that the 40-hour reduction in paid time off merely means \"five fewer spa days.\" University of Toronto professor Joe D'Cruz calculated that it would save $148 million a year, though GM is seeking $6 billion in Canadian government support.\n\nThe agreement is contingent on Canada being allocated 20% of GM's North American, and getting billions of dollars in federal and provincial taxpayer support, which Lewenza stressed will be loans. However, some suggested that this would not be the final time that automakers would request a bailout. \nDennis DesRosiers estimated that GM will go through its government loans in a couple of quarters, long before any recovery in the market. Furthermore, GM Canada president Arturo Elias had admitted to MP Frank Valeriote that GM had pledged all its assets worldwide to the U.S. government in order to secure the first tranche of a US$30-billion loan, leaving no assets to collateralize the $6 billion loan from the Canadian government. The Canadian Taxpayers' Federation noted that between 1982 and 2005, Ottawa handed out over $18.2 billion to corporations, of which only $7.1 billion was repayable, and only $1.3 billion was ever repaid.\nChrysler vice-chairman and president Thomas W. LaSorda (himself the son of a CAW official) and Ford's chief of manufacturing Joe Hinrichs said that the GM-CAW deal was insufficient, suggesting that they would break the CAW's negotiating pattern set by GM. LaSorda told the House of Commons of Canada finance committee that he would demand an hourly wage cut of $20, suggested that Chrysler may withdraw from Canada if it fails to achieve more substantial cost savings from the CAW.\n\nOn March 31, 2009, the Canadian federal and Ontario governments jointly rejected the restructuring plans submitted by GM and Chrysler. This came a day after US President Barack Obama had rejected the plans of their parent companies. Both federal Industry Minister Tony Clement and Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty suggested the CAW's initial deal was insufficient in cutting costs and the union had return to the bargaining table to make further concessions, in order to show that taxpayers' money is justified.\n\nOn May 14, 2018, the Canadian federal government announced it would fall short of breaking even from the bailouts of Chrysler Group LLC and General Motors Co. by $3.5 billion. On June 26, 2018, the remaining undisclosed loan amount was written off. The Fraser Institute estimates the total cost to taxpayers at $3.7 billion that was never repaid.\n\n"}

ECFS software does not work on the Apple Mac platform.\n\nECFS was conceived in November 2002 in Tarrant County, Texas. Initially, the purpose of the system was to enable law enforcement agencies to submit offense reports to the criminal district attorney's office for possible prosecution. In July 2003, the Criminal District Attorney's accepted the first electronic case filing via ECFS. Since that time, more than 100,000 cases have been filed in ECFS by the 47 Law Enforcement Agencies located in Tarrant County, Texas. ECFS was expanded in June 2004 to incorporate the Grand Jury function which is able to return Indictments to the Criminal District Courts on the same day that a True Bill is decided.\n\nIn January 2005, ECFS was extended to enable the Judges and their Court Staff to effectively manage the docket (case load) for each of the nine (9) Criminal District Courts. Since the implementation of ECFS, Tarrant County has been able to control the Jail population, despite a significant increase in the number of cases being filed. In August 2005, ECFS was extended to enable members of the Tarrant County Criminal Defense Lawyers Association to browse and view defendant, offense, and evidence via ECFS. Through this process, defense attorneys are no longer required to visit the Criminal District Attorney's Office to view and copy file.\n\nSince January 2006, the Criminal District Attorney's Office has been completely paperless and all Offense Reports are submitted via ECFS and made available to Law Enforcement Agencies, County and District Courts, and Defense Attorneys. In July 2006, ECFS was extended to allow criminal defendants to be masgistrated electronically. This process also allows the Office of Attorney appointments to be notified that the defendant has requested that defense counsel be appointed which triggers a business process that captures financial information, facilitates a determination of indigency, and when appropriate appoints defense counsel.\n\nIn 2005, the Tarrant County Criminal Defense Lawyer's Association, a non-profit charitable association, implemented its own software design to enable all attorney's, whether members of TCCDLA or not, to access the ECFS system. The software only works on PCs and will not work on Apple's Mac platform. The process enables an attorney to access his or her case files from any computer on the World Wide Web, and is secure and reliable. TCCDLA has continuously revised its software process to enable access 24-7, with little down time. TCCDLA also installed computers in the Tarrant County Justice Center that allow subscribers to access files while in the courthouse. Storm's Edge Technologies is the computer software company that exclusively provides support and design of the TCCDLA ECFS access system.\n\nCriminal District Attorney's Office:\n\n\nInformation technology:\n\n\nTarrant County Criminal Defense Lawyer's Association:\n\nStorm's Edge Technologies:\n\n"}

Europe's largest network association in the field of management development, it has over 890 member organizations from academia, business, public service and consultancy in 88 countries (as of September 2017). EFMD provides a forum for networking in management development.\n\nEFMD operates the EFMD Quality Improvement System (EQUIS), which is one of the leading international systems of quality assessment, improvement, and accreditation of higher education institutions in management and business administration. It is comparable to its American equivalent Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business and provides a forum for information, research, networking and debate on innovation and best practice in management development.\n\nThe foundation also runs the EPAS accreditation system for programmes as well as the EFMD Deans Across Frontiers development programme (EDAF) and the Business School Impact System (BSIS). \n\nWhile the EQUIS accreditation process, which is valid for an entire school (or faculty), is the main type of accreditation EFMD offers, there are a variety of other accreditations available. With EPAS it is possible for business schools to have certain degree programs accredited rather than the entire school. This variant somewhat resembles the AMBA (Association of MBAs) accreditation, as the London-based Association accredits the school's entire portfolio of MBA programs, but does not accredit the entire business school. EFMD also offers an accreditation for online courses (EOCCS) and for corporate learning (CLIP).\n\nIn business and management education, acquiring multiple accreditation by EQUIS, AACSB and AMBA is often considered the \"gold standard\" because a business school must go to through a rigorous certification process by each of the three accreditation bodies. Schools that acquire all three are often referred to as having a Triple accreditation or Triple Crown accreditation.\n\nEFMD is the European partner in the China Europe International Business School (CEIBS), a joint venture with Shanghai Jiaotong University established as the first international business school with autonomous status in 1994 under an agreement between the European Commission and the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. \nEFMD is also founding partner of the Global Foundation for Management Education (GFME), which is a joint venture with the US-based Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB International).

{"id": "33245805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=33245805", "title": "Feminine style of management", "text": "Feminine style of management\n\nThe feminine style of management is a management style generally characterized by more feminine quality soft skills and behaviors such as empathy, effective communication, and a generally more democratic or team-styled work environment. The style is a growing trend within businesses and is characterized by a form of transformational leadership style. The feminine style of management, although characterized by traits commonly labeled as feminine, it is not a style of management that is only used by females; it is also a style which has been found beneficial for particular types of businesses and organizations.\n\nBeginning with textile mills and the shoe-making industry of post-revolutionary America, the first real appearance of an explosion of women in a general workforce, whether at home or manufacturing, came at the turn of the century. By World War I, many women were poised to join the workforce as a high population of men served in the war. As men returned from the war and a falling economy led to the Great Depression, women suffered displacement. By World War II there was a similar growth of women in business that had been previously reserved for men. The combination of a better economy and a quickly changing standard of society norms, many women's roles and functions in business steadily increased following World II.\n\nIn the 1970s feminist authors denied or minimized the differences between men and women to establish that women had similar talents to men and should have equal labor opportunities. In Schutlz v. Wheaton Glass Co., a U.S. Court of Appeals ruled jobs held by men must be \"substantially equal\" but not \"identical\" to fall under the protection of the Equal Pay Act and that it is therefefore illegal for employers to change the job titles of women workers in order to pay them less than men.\n\nHowever, as the 1980s began, differences were more emphasized and noted as a means of progression due the management style differences that came of feminine values and ways of behaving, feeling, and thinking.\n\nIn 1991, women represented 45% of all managerial positions. Currently, although the feminine management style can be found being utilized throughout organizations internationally now, barriers to acceptance of this management style include stereotype and perceptions, mentoring and networking availability, workplace discrimination, family related issues, as well as funding availability. However, the rise in female leaders is a result of changing theories and practices of leadership.\n\nReasons a systematic theory of gender and organizations is necessary:\n\n\nIn addition to the reasons that it is necessary to examine feminine styles of management within theories of gendered organizations, Acker adds, is because gendering occurs in at least five different interacting processes.\n\n\nWithin the three main types of managerial styles, studies have examined differences in masculine and feminine styles. The first is the task management style, or how much a leader initiates, organizes, and/or defines work activities and processes. The second style,an interpersonal based style, which is a style where generally the leader builds morale, relationships, satisfaction, and commitment in the organization. Lastly, the third is the group decision making style, which is when the leader encourages a participative, democratic approach\n\nSome studies find differences between males' and females' task accomplishment styles and interpersonal styles. Males tended to be more task-oriented; females tended to be more relationship-oriented. These differences, however, have been observed only in men and women subjects of laboratory experiments, that is, people asked to speculate how they would behave if they were leaders. Management traditionally been male dominated and constructed in masculine terms. Present ideas involving femininity in management include transforming places of work into relation-oriented, flexible, and humane institutions.\n\nDifferences disappear in studies where actual managers are compared: most conclude that women do not behave differently from men in the same or similar kind of leadership position. Moreover, experienced women managers show no differences in leadership abilities from experienced male managers. These women, in fact, are likely to more closely resemble their male counterparts in drive, skills, temperament, and competitiveness, than the average woman in the population. Anne Cummings stated, \"\"The notion of what makes an effective leader is changing, and you will find both [traditionally defined] ‘masculine’ and ‘feminine’ components.\" In order for women to make an impact within an organization as an executive they need to be aware of their leadership styles and strengths.\n\nIn 1990, Alice Eagly and Johnson conducted a study on gender and leadership and found results they later emphasized with supporting meta-analysis data. Specifically, in 1992 and 1995, researchers Eagly and Johnson also conducted meta-analysis on the effectiveness and evaluation, respectively, of differing management styles. The results showed that the main difference in management styles in men and women were that women are more democratic, while men were found to generally be more autocratic, however, the studies show little evidence that would suggest males and females differ in their leadership effectiveness. This means that women tend to be more focused on encouraging participation and involving their workforce in business decisions while men are more focused on encouraging performance and driving towards tangible production.\n\nIn 2003, a meta-analysis was conducted by Eagly, Johannesen-Schmidt, and Van Engen that compared male and female managers on measures of transformational, transactional, and laissez-faire leadership styles; their findings emphasized the results of their previous study.The meta-analysis study showed that women were slightly more likely than men to exercise a transformational leadership style.\n\nThis is a style of management that is likely to be used by coaches, teachers, and other individuals focused on developing subordinates. The transformational leadership encourages participation and creative problem solving. Eagly proposes that the transformational style of management is likely more advantageous for women to employ however. Men were shown to be more likely to critique their employees and be less interactive, in contrast to the women who utilized a more \"hands-on\" approach.\n\nIn contrast, research in the past few decades shows that these results are only averages. Men and Women do not show a significant difference in these management styles, only slight differences. Some men proved to use more feminine styles, while some women proved to use more masculine styles. Eagly states that,\"the sex differences are small because the leader role itself carries a lot of weight in determining people's behavior.\"\"\n\nIn 2005, a year-long study conducted by Caliper, a Princeton, New Jersey-based management consulting firm, and Aurora, a London-based organization that advances women, identified a number of characteristics that distinguish women leaders from men when it comes to qualities of leadership: Women leaders are more assertive and persuasive, have a stronger need to get things done and are more willing to take risks than male leaders...Women leaders were also found to be more empathetic and flexible, as well as stronger in interpersonal skills than their male counterparts...enabling them to read situations accurately and take information in from all sides...These women leaders are able to bring others around to their point of view...because they genuinely understand and care about where others are coming from...so that the people they are leading feel more understood, supported and valued. These findings were summarized into four specific statements about women's leadership qualities: (1) Women leaders are more persuasive than their male counterparts, (2) When feeling the sting of rejection, women leaders learn from adversity and carry on with an \"I'll show you\" attitude, (3) Women leaders demonstrate an inclusive, team-building leadership style of problem solving and decision making, (4) Women leaders are more likely to ignore rules and take risks.\n\nBET's CEO, Debra Lee, explains that it is easy to generalize the differences in gender leadership styles as \"women do it this way, and men do it that way.\" Instead of simply generalizing, Debra Lee asserts that it is important to discuss these differences so that women don't feel uncomfortable managing differently from men. During this interview she further states that we should encourage young women to climb the corporate ladder. Lee explained that her hardest lesson was learning to follow her gut when others challenged it, but that lesson has truly paid off. She insists that we encourage young women to do the same.\n\nIt's vital for women to embrace these differences. During a 2006 speech given by Dr. Musimbi Kanyoro, the World YWCA Secretary General, she explained that the attitudes toward leadership are changing and what women offer is essential. She stated: \"Domination as a leadership style is becoming less and less popular. There is a new growing appreciation of...those traits that women use to keep families together and to organize volunteers to unite and make change in the shared life of communities. These newly admired leadership qualities of shared leadership; nurturance and doing good for others are today not only sought after but also indeed needed to make a difference in the world...A feminine way of leading includes helping the world to understand and be principled about values that really matter.\"\n\nThe feminine style of management embodying organizational progression, more and more female leaders are found within society today. In addition to the thousands of women who now receive graduate and doctoral degrees, many hold managerial positions within companies, and females hold 45% of all managerial posts.\n\nToday, many nonprofit organizations take a feminine style of leadership approach when handling employees. These particular organizations tend to encourage participation among group members, show flexibility, and maintain a non-hierarchical work environment.\n\nLeaders that take on this style tend to show genuine care and understanding towards their employees. The empathy they have for others enables their employees to feel as though they are recognized and valued within the organization. These leaders are also known for their communication skills and tendency to listen to multiple perspective before making decisions. Their desire to use team-building activities creates a sense of community within organizations, which in turn helps to meet overall goals. An example of a company using team-building, genuinely understand its employees needs, and embracing femininity is Mary Kay Cosmetics. This company strives to treat employees as individuals and help them reach their personal goals. When employees meet particular sales goals they are rewarded with things they desire, such as pink Cadillacs and diamonds. These actions show employees that they are valued and understood, which leads to a positive corporate culture.\n\nSung-Joo Kim, chairman and chief executive of luxury-goods company MCM Worldwide, is an example of a woman using the feminine style of management to help successfully run a company.Kim's sensitivity and openness towards employees gives her an advantage over other luxury-good corporations. Kim has to find a balance between her sensitivity and still maintaining order and a level of toughness. Kim grew up in a patriarchal Korean household and her experiences led her to strive to prove to others that femininity and power are not mutually exclusive and it is quite possible to be a nurturing woman and still run a successful business.\n\nAccording to Esther Wachs Book, \"A new breed of leader is emerging, and that breed is female.\" She contends that women, such as Meg Whitman of eBay and Marcy Carsey of Carsey-Werner, succeed because they embody seven uniquely female abilities: they can sell their visions; they are not afraid to reinvent the rules; they are focused on achievement; they show courage under fire; they turn challenges into opportunities; they are aware of customer preferences; and they maximize what Book calls \"high touch\" in an era of high tech.\n\n"}

With his brother, Sealy, he commissioned the development of the Fourdrinier machine, a papermaking machine that produced continuous rolls of paper. The machine is an industrialised version of the historical hand paper-making method, which could not satisfy the demands of developing modern society for large quantities of printing and writing materials. \n\nA patent was granted on 24 July 1806, for a machine that could make a long continuous web of paper. This had the dual advantage of considerably higher productivity plus production in roll form, for applications such as wallpaper printing. The range of cut paper sizes was also extended as it was not limited by the frame or deckle size of hand made paper.\n\nThe invention cost £60000, and caused the brothers to go bankrupt. Due to various laws, it was difficult to protect the patent on the machine, and the new system was widely adopted but with no benefit to the inventors. \n\nIn 1814, two machines were made in Peterhof, Russia, by order of the Russian emperor on the condition £700 would be paid to Fourdrinier every year for ten years — but, despite petitioning Tsar Nicholas, no money was ever paid. In 1839, a petition was brought before parliament, and in 1840, £7000 was paid to Fourdrinier and his family.\n\nFourdrinier died in 1854, at the age of 88.\n\n"}
{"id": "6537051", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6537051", "title": "History of the bushfood industry", "text": "History of the bushfood industry\n\nThe modern Australian native food industry, also called the bushfood industry, had its initial beginnings in the 1970s and early 1980s, when regional enthusiasts and researchers started to target local native species. In the mid 1970s Brian Powell recognized the commercial potential of quangdong fruit and began its cultivation in orchards. Following this, the CSIRO became involved in quangdong research.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Peter Hardwick began investigating subtropical native plants suitable for commercial cropping, selecting fruit species like riberry, Davidsonia, and later leaf-spices, like lemon myrtle, Aniseed myrtle, and Dorrigo Pepper. Hardwick started targeting strong flavoured species suitable for processing, which later became the main industry strategy. In the 1980s, Hardwick worked in the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, where he met essential oils researcher, Dr Ian Southwell. Southwell played a significant role in providing the essential oil profiles of many of the most popular native spices.\n\nIn 1983. the University of Sydney's Human Nutrition Unit, headed by Jennie Brand-Miller, undertook a nutritional analysis programme analyzing bushfood for Aboriginal health. Vic Cherikoff, a member of the Human Nutrition Unit team, started-up a wholesale distribution company marketing native Australian ingredients. Cherikoff played a vital role in linking-up the Aboriginal and regional bushfood research with the restaurant and food processing industry. Cherikoff also contributed to Jennifer Isaacs' book, \"Bush Food\" and authored \"The Bushfood Handbook\" and \"Uniquely Australian, A wildfood cookbook\" which publicly defined the emerging industry.\n\nIn the mid-1980s several Australian theme restaurants opened-up in Sydney. This included \"Rowntrees The Australian Restaurant\", run by Chef Jean-Paul Bruneteau and Jenny Dowling. In 1996, Bruneteau, Dowling and Cherikoff opened a second restaurant, \"Riberries – Taste Australia\". \"Edna’s Table\" restaurant also opened-up and was run by brother and sister team, Chef Raymond Kersh and Jennice Kersh. The \"Red Ochre Grill\" in Adelaide opened-up in the early 1990s, with Andrew Fielke as its chef. Fielke also co-founded a production company, \"Australian Native Produce Industries\" (ANPI).\n\nValue-added production emerged in the late 1980s with products marketed via mainstream retailers. Ian and Juleigh Robbins, established a line of processed sauces, jams and dried spice products through \"Robin's Foods Pty Ltd\". Boutique value-added production − such as jams, sauces and beverages – has become increasingly significant in the regional development of native foods.\n\nSmall-scale trial commercial production of native food plants started to occur in the late 1980s, especially in Northern New South Wales. In 1994 the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation and Greening Australia co-sponsored a conference on growing bushfoods near Lismore. The 2000 Olympic Games, in Sydney, were targeted by the developing industry as an event for promoting native foods.\n\nVarious regionally based industry associations were formed to represent growers in a national process. Government agencies have become increasingly involved with new native crop development. CSIRO researcher, Dr Stephen Sykes, developed a range of native \"Citrus\" hybrids which became available through ANPI.\n\nSince 2000 the industry has continued to consolidate, with a growing overseas market for produce and greater refinement in production methods to supply the demand. Some new products have been introduced, including Finger Lime, mintbush and \"Eucalyptus olida\". However, while the rate of introduction of new native food-plant species has slowed since the early period of the industries conception in the 1980s, the marketing of herb and spice blends, fruit mixtures and functional extracts has grown, potentially leading the industry into new and larger market segments.\n\nCrops initially associated mainly with bushfood, such as lemon myrtle, have since broadened to become associated with essential oils and cosmetics.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "40272", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40272", "title": "Industrial sociology", "text": "Industrial sociology\n\nIndustrial sociology, until recently a crucial research area within the field of sociology of work, examines\nOne branch of industrial sociology is labour process theory (LPT). In 1974, Harry Braverman wrote \"Labor and Monopoly Capital\", which provided a critical analysis of scientific management. This book analysed capitalist productive relations from a Marxist perspective. Following Marx, Braverman argued that work within capitalist organizations was exploitative and alienating, and therefore workers had to be coerced into servitude. For Braverman the pursuit of capitalist interests over time ultimately leads to deskilling and routinization of the worker. The Taylorist work design is the ultimate embodiment of this tendency.\n\nBraverman demonstrated several mechanisms of control in both the factory blue-collar and clerical white-collar labour force.\nHis key contribution is his \"deskilling\" thesis. Braverman argued that capitalist owners and managers were incessantly driven to deskill the labour force to lower production costs and ensure higher productivity. Deskilled labour is cheap and above all easy to control due to the workers' lack of direct engagement in the production process. In turn work becomes intellectually or emotionally unfulfilling; the lack of capitalist reliance on human skill reduces the need of employers to reward workers in anything but a minimal economic way.\n\nBraverman's contribution to the sociology of work and industry (i.e., industrial sociology) has been important and his theories of the labour process continue to inform teaching and research. Braverman's thesis has, however, been contested, by Andrew Freidman in his work \"Industry and Labour\" (1977). In it, Freidman suggests that whilst the direct control of labour is beneficial for the capitalist under certain circumstances, a degree of \"responsible autonomy\" can be granted to unionized or \"core\" workers, in order to harness their skill under controlled conditions. Also, Richard Edwards showed in 1979 that although hierarchy in organizations has remained constant, additional forms of control (such as technical control via email monitoring, call monitoring; bureaucratic control via procedures for leave, sickness etc.) has been added to gain the interests of the capitalist class versus the workers. Duncan Gallie has shown how important it is to approach the question of skill from a social class perspective. In his study, the majority of non-manual, intermediate and skilled manual workers believed that their work had come to demand a higher level of skill, but the majority of manual worker felt that the responsibility and skill needed in their work had either remained constant or declined. This means that Braverman's claims can't be applied to all social classes.\n\nThe notion the particular type of technology workers were exposed to shapes their experience was most forcefully argued in a classic study by Robert Blauner. He argued that some work is alienating more than other types because of the different technologies workers use. Alienation, to Blauner, has four dimensions: powerlessness, meaninglessness, isolation, and self-estrangement. Individuals are powerless when they can't control their own actions or conditions of work; work is meaningless when it gives employees little or no sense of value, interest or worth; work is isolating when workers cannot identify with their workplace; and work is self-estranging when, at the subjective level, the worker has no sense of involvement in the job.\n\nBlauner's claims however fail to recognize that the same technology can be experienced in a variety of ways. Studies have shown that cultural differences with regard to management–union relations, levels of hierarchical control, and reward and performance appraisal policies mean that the experience of the same kind of work can vary considerably between countries and firms. The individualization of work and the need for workers to have more flexible skills in order to respond to technological changes means that Blauner's characterization of work experience is no longer valid. Additionally, workers today may work in teams to alleviate workers' sense of alienation, since they are involved in the entire process, rather than just a small part of it. In conclusion, automative technologies and computerized work systems have typically enhanced workers' job satisfaction and skill deployment in the better-paid, secure public and private sector jobs. But, in more non-skilled manual work, they have just perpetuated job dissatisfaction, especially for the many women involved in this type of work.\n\n"}

That year, the company also introduced Quick Fields, an automated document processing module, and WebLink, which provided read-only, Web-based access to documents stored in Laserfiche.\n\nIn 2004, Laserfiche 7 marked the company’s first offering for Oracle users.\n\nIn early 2008, the company released Laserfiche 8, with a re-written workflow engine and integration with Microsoft SharePoint. In August 2008, the company launched Laserfiche Rio, an enterprise content management offering with unlimited servers, named user licensing and bundled functionality including content management, business process management and a thin-client interface called Web Access.\n\nIn 2009, Laserfiche opened an international office in Hong Kong, creating a separate company Laserfiche International.\n\nIn 2010, Laserfiche filed a lawsuit against SAP for trademark infringement over the disputed trademark phrase \"Run Smarter\". In 2011, Laserfiche announced that the litigation had been settled amicably and involved a license of the “Run Smarter” trademark.\n\nIn 2011, Laserfiche released Laserfiche Mobile for iPhone, an app that allows users to capture images with the phone's built-in camera, store them in the Laserfiche repository and include them in digital workflows. Later that year, Laserfiche was listed as a Champion in Info-Tech Research Group’s Enterprise Content Management (ECM) for Process Workers Vendor Landscape. According to Info-Tech, “Laserfiche is a stalwart that is exploiting the new capabilities of emerging technology.\n\nIn 2012, Laserfiche released Laserfiche Mobile for iPad, an app that extends governance, risk and compliance standards to the iPad.\n\nLaserfiche said it was profitable since 1994, growing at what Wacker describes as a managed pace.\n\nLaserfiche has two main product lines: Laserfiche Rio and Laserfiche Avante.\n\nLaserfiche Rio is designed to meet the needs of large organizations that have more than 100 users. It combines content management functionality with business process management (BPM), security and auditing, unlimited servers and a thin-client interface.

Regions with cities commonly ranked in the top 50 include the United States, Canada, Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Three examples of such surveys are Monocle's \"Most Liveable Cities Index\", the Economist Intelligence Unit's \"Global Liveability Ranking\", and \"Mercer Quality of Living Survey\". Numbeo has the largest statistics and survey data based on cities and countries. Livability rankings may be used by employers assigning hardship allowances as part of job relocation.\n\nThe Economist Intelligence Unit's (EIU) publishes an annual Global Liveability Ranking, which ranks 140 cities for their urban quality of life based on assessments of their stability, healthcare, culture and environment, education and infrastructure.\n\nMelbourne, Australia, had been ranked by the EIU as the world's most livable city for seven years in a row, from 2011 to 2017. Between 2004 and 2010, Vancouver, Canada, was ranked the EIU's most livable city, with Melbourne sharing first place in the inaugural 2002 report. Vancouver has ranked third since 2015, while Vienna, Austria, ranked second until 2018 when it ranked first.\n\nThe Syrian capital, Damascus, was ranked the least livable city of the 140 assessed in 2016.\n\nThe EIU also publishes a Worldwide Cost of Living Survey that compares the cost of living in a range of global cities.\n\nAmerican global human resources and related financial services consulting firm Mercer annually releases its Mercer Quality of Living Survey, comparing 221 cities based on 39 criteria. New York City is given a baseline score of 100 and other cities are rated in comparison. Important criteria are safety, education, hygiene, health care, culture, environment, recreation, political-economic stability, public transport and access to goods and services. The list is intended to help multinational companies decide where to open offices or plants, and how much to pay employees. For nine consecutive years (2009–2017), Mercer ranked Austria's capital Vienna first in its annual \"Quality of Living\" survey, a title the city still held in 2016.\nSince 2006, the lifestyle magazine \"Monocle\" has published an annual list of livable cities. The list in 2008 was named \"The Most Liveable Cities Index\" and presented 25 top locations for quality of life.\n\nImportant criteria in this survey are safety/crime, international connectivity, climate/sunshine, quality of architecture, public transport, tolerance, environmental issues and access to nature, urban design, business conditions, pro-active policy developments and medical care.\n\nThe 2018 Monocle Survey determined the world's most livable city was Munich, followed by Tokyo, Vienna and Zurich. A total of four German cities were on the list of the 25 most livable cities, 15 out of the 25 were European, 3 each from Japan and Australia, and one from North America (Vancouver).

{"id": "673350", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=673350", "title": "OLAP cube", "text": "OLAP cube\n\nIn database engineering in computing, OLAP cube is a term that typically refers to a multi-dimensional array of data.\n\n\"OLAP\" is an acronym for online analytical processing, which is a computer-based technique of analyzing data to look for insights. The term \"cube\" here refers to a multi-dimensional\ndataset, which is also sometimes called a hypercube if the number of dimensions is greater than 3.\n\nA cube can be considered a multi-dimensional generalization of a two- or three-dimensional spreadsheet. For example, a company might wish to summarize financial data by product, by time-period, and by city to compare actual and budget expenses. Product, time, city and scenario (actual and budget) are the data's dimensions.\n\n\"Cube\" is a shorthand for \"multidimensional dataset\", given that data can have an arbitrary number of \"dimensions\". The term hypercube is sometimes used, especially for data with more than three dimensions. A cube is not a \"cube\" in the strict mathematical sense, as all the sides are not necessarily equal. But this term is used widely.\n\n\"Slice\" is a term for a dimension which is held constant for all cells so that multi-dimensional information can be shown in a two-dimensional physical space of a spreadsheet or pivot table.\n\nEach cell of the cube holds a number that represents some \"measure\" of the business, such as sales, profits, expenses, budget and forecast.\n\nOLAP data is typically stored in a star schema or snowflake schema in a relational data warehouse or in a special-purpose data management system. Measures are derived from the records in the fact table and dimensions are derived from the dimension tables.\n\nThe elements of a dimension can be organized as a hierarchy, a set of parent-child relationships, typically where a parent member summarizes its children. Parent elements can further be aggregated as the children of another parent.\n\nFor example, May 2005's parent is Second Quarter 2005 which is in turn the child of Year 2005. Similarly cities are the children of regions; products roll into product groups and individual expense items into types of expenditure.\n\nConceiving data as a cube with hierarchical dimensions leads to conceptually straightforward operations to facilitate analysis. Aligning the data content with a familiar visualization enhances analyst learning and productivity. The user-initiated process of navigating by calling for page displays interactively, through the specification of slices via rotations and drill down/up is sometimes called \"slice and dice\". Common operations include slice and dice, drill down, roll up, and pivot.\n\"Slice\" is the act of picking a rectangular subset of a cube by choosing a single value for one of its dimensions, creating a new cube with one fewer dimension. The picture shows a slicing operation: The sales figures of all sales regions and all product categories of the company in the year 2005 and 2006 are \"sliced\" out of the data cube.\n\n\"Dice\": The dice operation produces a subcube by allowing the analyst to pick specific values of multiple dimensions. The picture shows a dicing operation: The new cube shows the sales figures of a limited number of product categories, the time and region dimensions cover the same range as before.\n\n\"Drill Down/Up\" allows the user to navigate among levels of data ranging from the most summarized (up) to the most detailed (down).\nThe picture shows a drill-down operation: The analyst moves from the summary category \"Outdoor-Schutzausrüstung\" to see the sales figures for the individual products.\n\"Roll-up\": A roll-up involves summarizing the data along a dimension. The summarization rule might be computing totals along a hierarchy or applying a set of formulas such as \"profit = sales - expenses\".\n\n\"Pivot\" allows an analyst to rotate the cube in space to see its various faces. For example, cities could be arranged vertically and products horizontally while viewing data for a particular quarter. Pivoting could replace products with time periods to see data across time for a single product.\n\nThe picture shows a pivoting operation: The whole cube is rotated, giving another perspective on the data.\n\nIn database theory, an OLAP cube is an abstract representation of a projection of an RDBMS relation. Given a relation of order \"N\", consider a projection that subtends \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\" as the key and \"W\" as the residual attribute. Characterizing this as a function,\n\nthe attributes \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\" correspond to the axes of the cube, while the \"W\" value corresponds to the data element that populates each cell of the cube.\n\nInsofar as two-dimensional output devices cannot readily characterize three dimensions, it is more practical to project \"slices\" of the data cube (we say \"project\" in the classic vector analytic sense of dimensional reduction, not in the SQL sense, although the two are conceptually similar),\n\nwhich may suppress a primary key, but still have some semantic significance, perhaps a slice of the triadic functional representation for a given \"Z\" value of interest.\n\nThe motivation behind OLAP displays harks back to the \"cross-tabbed report\" paradigm of 1980s DBMS. The resulting spreadsheet-style display, where values of \"X\" populate row $1; values of \"Y\" populate column $A; and values of \"g\" : ( \"X\", \"Y\" ) → \"W\" populate the individual cells \"southeast of\" $B2, so to speak, $B2 itself included.\n\n"}

The International Financial Reporting Standards defines operating cash flow as cash generated from operations less taxation and interest paid, investment income received and less dividends paid gives rise to operating cash flows. To calculate cash generated from operations, one must calculate cash generated from customers and cash paid to suppliers. The difference between the two reflects cash generated from operations.\n\nCash generated from \"operating\" customers\n\nCash paid to \"operating\" suppliers\n\n(1): \"operating\": Variations of Assets Suppliers and Clients accounts will be disclosed in the Financial Cash Flow\n\n(2): Cost of Sales = Stock Out for sales. It is Cash Neutral. Cost of Sales - Stock Variation = Stock out - (Stock out - Stock In)= Stock In = Purchase of goods: Cash Out\n\nInterest is an operating flow. Since it adjusts for liabilities, receivables, and depreciation, operating cash flow is a more accurate measure of how much cash a company has generated (or used) than traditional measures of profitability such as net income or EBIT. For example, a company with numerous fixed assets on its books (e.g. factories, machinery, etc.) would likely have decreased net income due to depreciation; however, as depreciation is a non-cash expense the operating cash flow would provide a more accurate picture of the company's current cash holdings than the artificially low net income.\n\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP metric that can be used to evaluate a company's profitability based on net working capital. The difference between EBITDA and OCF would then reflect how the entity finances its net working capital in the short term. OCF is not a measure of free cash flow and the effect of investment activities would need to be considered to arrive at the free cash flow of the entity.\n\n"}

Prior to that, history was passed down only through song and word. As can be seen with religion, books and spoken word, science (through journals and studies) organizing not only is history, but also supports the communication of history. Recording ideas in a written text, as opposed to verbally communicating with someone, and more specifically cataloging ideas and thoughts, is also an attempt to organize information.\n\nScience books are notable by their organization of a specific subject. Encyclopedias usually organize subjects into a single place, for faster indexing and seeking of meanings.\n\nThe following are the important characteristics of organization.\n\n\n\nOrganizing, in companies point of view, is the management function that usually follows after planning. And it involves the assignment of tasks, the grouping of tasks into departments and the assignment of authority with adequate responsibility and allocation of resources across the organization to achieve common goals.\n\nThe framework in which the organization defines how tasks are divided, resources are deployed, and departments are coordinated.\n\n\nWork specialization (also called division of labour or job specialization) is the degree to which organizational tasks are sub-divided into individual jobs. It may increase the efficiency of workers, but with too much specialization, employees may feel isolated and bored. Many organizations enlarge jobs or rotate assigned tasks to provide greater challenges.\n\nChain of command is the vertical lines of a command structure that is used for the purposes of overall responsibility and accountability in the achieving of stated goals and objectives through the use of orders one direction and reports of compliance in the other direction. Chain of command differs from horizontal lines in an organization which are basically the communication and coordinating lines of the organization.\nChain of command(also referred to as 'scalar principle') states that a clear , unbroken chain of command should link every employee with someone at a higher level, all the way to the top of the organisation.\n\n\nDelegation is the transfer of authority and/or responsibility to others, often lower in position. Delegation can improve flexibility to meet customers’ needs and adapt to competitive environments.\nPossible reasons for delegation:\n1. Efficiency - many people can complete a task faster than one/few\n2. Specialization - delegating simple tasks allows more important/complex tasks to be completed by the most qualified\n3. Training - delegating a task to a trainee so that they may learn from experience\n\nLine authority managers have the formal power to direct and control immediate subordinates. The superior issues orders and is responsible for the result and the subordinate obeys and is responsible only for executing the order according to instructions.\n\nFunctional authority is where managers have formal power over a specific subset of activities. For instance, the Production Manager may have the line authority to decide whether and when a new machine is needed but the Controller demands that a Capital Expenditure Proposal is submitted first, showing that the investment will have a yield of at least x%; or, a legal department may have functional authority to interfere in any activity that could have legal consequences. This authority would not be functional but it would rather be staff authority if such interference is \"advice\" rather than \"order\".\n\nStaff authority is granted to staff specialists in their areas of expertise. It is not a real authority in the sense that a staff manager does not order or instruct but simply advises, recommends, and counsels in the staff specialists' area of expertise and is responsible only for the quality of the advice (to be in line with the respective professional standards etc.) It is a communication relationship with management. It has an influence that derives indirectly from line authority at a higher level.\n\nCategories:\nFactors influencing larger span of management.\n\n\n\nDepartmentalization is the basis on which individuals are grouped into departments and departments into total organizations. Approach options include:\n\n\n"}

It was released worldwide on 17 November 2016. Frontier had previously worked in the amusement park construction and management genre with \"RollerCoaster Tycoon 3\" (to which \"Planet Coaster\" is a spiritual successor), \"Thrillville\", \"\", and \"Zoo Tycoon\".\n\nThere are three different modes in the game, namely Sandbox, Challenge, and Career. In the career mode, players assume the role of a theme park manager, and must complete tasks such as constructing unfinished roller coasters or hiring janitors. In Sandbox mode, players are tasked to construct their own theme park on an empty plot of land. The challenge mode is similar to the sandbox mode, but with added difficulty, as players need to take funds into account.\n\nOriginally called \"Coaster Park Tycoon\", the game was revealed on 29 January 2015 and was renamed during E3 2015. \"Planet Coaster\" is Frontier's second self-published franchise, following \"\". Frontier organized multiple alpha and beta testings before launching in November 2016. The game was supported with free post-release downloadable content upon launch. The title received positive reviews upon release, with critics praising the game's sandbox mode and creation tools. Criticisms were mainly directed to the game's career mode. It was a commercial success, with more than 400,000 copies sold in its first month of release.\n\n\"Planet Coaster\" is a construction and management simulation video game. Similar to its spiritual predecessor, the game allows players to build different theme park rides and roller-coasters. These player-created attractions can be shared through a mechanic called \"global village\". The game also comes with ten mascots.\n\nBefore starting the game, the player must create their own avatar. Afterwards, the player is able to choose between three game modes: sandbox, challenge, and career.\n\nSimilar to Frontier's previous game, \"RollerCoaster Tycoon 3\", the Sandbox Mode enables players to construct their own theme park on an empty plot of land. In Sandbox Mode, all features and rides of the game are unlocked and your funds are unlimited. This is the mode most players use to create items (parks, coasters, scenery, etc.) and then post them to Steam's Planet Coaster Workshop.\n\nIn the Challenge Mode, the player must construct an amusement park on an empty lot (similar to Sandbox Mode) but with limited funds and research depending on chosen difficulty—Easy, Medium, or Hard. As the player develops their park, the game presents the player with challenges that the player must accept or decline. Upon completion of a challenge, the player is given a reward such as a park rating boost or a sum of money.\n\nIn the Career Mode, the player must complete objectives such as constructing roller coasters, achieving park ratings or hiring janitors. Similar to Frontier's previous game, \"RollerCoaster Tycoon 3\", Career Mode allows players to progress by completing scenarios with objectives in different difficulties.\n\nFirst unveiled at EGX 2016, the game also features a dedicated mode called the \"crash mode\" which allows players to construct incomplete coasters and let them crash into the park's visitors.\n\nOn 26 April 2017, Frontier revealed the existence of several cheat codes that were previously undiscovered on their official forums. These included the ability to ride go-karts and the ability for security guards to plough through guests similarly to a bulldozer.\n\nBefore the development of \"Planet Coaster\", Frontier Developments had developed several other construction and management simulation video games, including 2004's commercial and critical success \"RollerCoaster Tycoon 3\", which sold over 10 million copies. \"Planet Coaster\" serves only as a spiritual successor to \"RollerCoaster Tycoon 3\" instead of a direct sequel, as the company considered the use of the brand \"Tycoon\" \"didn’t carry the cachet anymore\" due to the releases of mainly poorly-received \"Tycoon\" games in recent years. In a December 2016 interview with Cambridge News, David Walsh (the Chief Operating Officer of Frontier Developments) said that the success of \"\"\nenabled the company \"to bring Planet Coaster to the market, which is highly significant as it demonstrates we are not a single game company”. Frontier Developments spent £6 million on the game's development and an additional £1.5 million on marketing.\n\nThe game was announced on 29 January 2015 by Frontier Developments. Originally called \"Coaster Park Tycoon\", the game was renamed into \"Planet Coaster\" on 16 June 2015 during the PC Gaming Show at E3 2015. Frontier Developments aimed to turn the game into the company's second self-published franchise, along with the \"\" series. The game uses an advanced version of Cobra Engine, which is an in-house proprietary engine developed by Frontier previously used by games like \"Elite Dangerous\" and \"RollerCoaster Tycoon 3\". Features confirmed for the game include a hybrid spline/piece-by-piece coaster builder, modular structure building, a voxel terrain editor among others detailed through Q&A's and \"Dev Diaries.\" On the second live stream, the release date of the alpha was announced. Released on 22 March 2016, the alpha emphasized on modular building and paths. The alpha contained two themes: \"Planet Coaster\" and \"Pirate\". Although disabled by default, Coaster Building was included in the first alpha through a cheat code.\n\nOn 24 May 2016, Frontier released the second alpha build. This build included finances, terrain tools, improved path building, and the official release of a coaster builder. Also, on 25 August, Frontier discontinued further alpha purchases. On 24 September, Frontier announced at EGX 2016 that players who had pre-ordered the \"Thrillseeker Edition\" would be able to test the game that October. At Gamescom 2016, Frontier announced that the game would be released on 17 November 2016. The game was released with Denuvo's anti-tamper technology.\n\nTo record the audio for the game, sound designer Watson Wu took over the Holiday World & Splashin' Safari theme park in Santa Claus, Indiana to record the sounds of various attractions. Guests in the park and park staff speak their own fictional language, known as \"Planco\". According to James Stant, Frontier's senior audio designer, the language contains about 7,000 words. After the game's release, Frontier Developments released an official Planco dictionary.\n\n\"Planet Coaster\" features a dynamic soundtrack composed by Jim Guthrie and JJ Ipsen, released under the album titled \"You, Me & Gravity: The Music of Planet Coaster\". Additionally, players may upload their own sound files to use in their parks.\n\nOn 21 July 2017, Frontier launched paid DLC for the game featuring props inspired by \"Back to the Future\", \"Knight Rider\", and \"The Munsters\".\n\nIn August 2017, Frontier partnered with the Cedar Point amusement park to provide an in-game version of the park's upcoming Steel Vengeance roller coaster before the ride officially opened in 2018.\n\nOn 21 September 2018, Frontier announced the \"Thememaker's Toolkit\". This toolkit will enable players to export custom 3D models into Planet Coaster itself. This will be released on the 20th of November.\n\nThe game was met with praise upon release of the alpha. Andy Kelly of \"PC Gamer\" commented that Frontier was \"off to a tremendous start\", adding that creating buildings with the creation tools hinted at \"immense possibilities\". However, Mark Walton of \"Ars Technica\" noted several small flaws including the \"hard to navigate\" menus and the lack of custom built roller coasters. On 27 April 2016, about a month after the release of the alpha, Frontier announced that \"Planet Coaster\" had grossed nearly two million dollars.\n\nMatt Wales of \"Eurogamer\" recommended the game, concluding that the game is \"the finest simulator yet\". Meanwhile, Ben Reeves of \"Game Informer\" praised the game for its creative mode but criticized the game's career mode, referring it to as \"boring\" and \"tedious\". TJ Hafer of \"IGN\" compared the game's integration of Steam Workshop to \"Minecraft\" and \"Second Life\". Edmond Tran of \"GameSpot\" praised the game for its accessible creative tools and for its evocative tone. Jonathan Leack of Game Revolution claimed that the game \"resurrected the [theme park simulation] genre\". In a critical review of the game, Jody Macgregor of \"PC Gamer\" praised the game's challenge mode but criticized the game for not innovating enough from \"RollerCoaster Tycoon 3\". The original score (70/100) was retracted due to miscommunication between Frontier Developments and \"PC Gamer\" with the game version they received; its reevaluated score is 75/100. Patrick Hancock of Destructoid noted that the game suffers frame rate issues in larger parks. Furthermore, \"Edge\" noted that the game's \"fiddly\" camera makes some actions harder.\n\nUpon release, the game topped the Steam \"top sellers\" charts. The game sold over 400,000 copies in the first month of its release. Despite being released later in the year, \"Planet Coaster\" was featured on Steam's \"Top 100 Best Sellers of 2016\" chart as a \"silver tier\" title. In August 2017, the game has sold over one million copies. In July 2018, a leak in Valve’s API revealed that over 1.68 million Steam users owned Planet Coaster.\n\n"}
{"id": "40944126", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=40944126", "title": "Polymer solution casting", "text": "Polymer solution casting\n\nPolymer solution casting is a manufacturing process used to make flexible plastic components which are typically in the shape of a single or multi-lumen tube commonly utilized in the medical device industry. This manufacturing technology is unique in that the process does not require conventional extrusion or injection molding technologies, yet it readily incorporates components and features traditionally produced by these processes.\n\nThe polymer solution casting process utilizes a mandrel, or inner diameter mold, that is immersed in a tank of polymer solution or liquid plastic that has been specifically engineered for the process. Due to a combination of thermal and frictional properties, the polymer solution then forms a thin film around the mold. The mold is then extracted from the tank in a precisely controlled manner, followed by a curing or drying process. Once the first layer of thin film is appropriately solidified, secondary features can be added to the product such as braided or coiled wire, laser-cut hypotubes or engineered metal reinforcements to prevent kinking, or imaging targets specific to the intended medical application. Multiple casting steps can then be repeated to encapsulate the reinforcements, build up wall thickness, add additional lumens and optimize column strength. The part is then removed from the mold after it is cured or solidified. \nThe most notable attribute of this thin-film process technology is the ability to alternate the material properties (i.e. strength, durometer, color, lubricity) amongst the individual layers or even down the length of the part, resulting in a feature-rich single-piece construction. This process also allows other components to be incorporated into the structure of the part during the layering processes, such as injection molded components and extruded tubes made of high performance polymers such as PTFE, PEBAX, and polyimide.\n\nAnother notable advantage of polymer solution casting technology is that the total manufacturing cost for both prototyping and production volumes are frequently less than the conventional technologies. This cost benefit results from the use of inexpensive molds coupled with the scalability and adaptability of the manufacturing line. As a result, new products and processes are readily developed and implemented, facilitating cost-effective creation of very feature rich and complex catheters.\nSince the 1990s, Avalon Laboratories and Piper Plastics Corp. have aggressively pioneered polymer solution casting technology, focusing on complex medical devices. The history of these technologies dates back to many highly regarded names in the medical industry including Medtronic, BioMedicus, Bard, Terumo, Research Medical Inc., Shiley, Polaris Plastics, and Caplugs.\n\nPolymer solution casting technology can be deployed utilizing a host of different polymer materials depending on the application and design inputs, including those used in Class I, II and III medical devices.\nThe earliest and most commonly found materials were polyvinyl chlorides (PVC) due to their advantages in cost, physical properties and clarity. Over the past twenty years, there has been scrutiny of the long term health effects of the PVC base materials relating to the plasticizers and stabilizers which are needed to ensure adequate shelf life of sterilized product. More recently, newly engineered formulations have eliminated these biocompatibility concerns while extending the shelf life, and PVC has re-emerged as a preferred polymer for use in interventional and surgical applications.\n\nPolyurethane has emerged as another polymer that meets the medical device market's demands for thinner wall sections, longer lengths and extended blood exposure. The high strength and range of properties make these materials an excellent choice for soft elastomer applications. Among the first commercial polyurethane medical products were non-allergenic medical gloves, developed as a response to latex allergies. These advanced polymers offer a full range of physical properties, improved biocompatibility, and lubricous properties by way of custom formulations and coatings.\n\nAnother material choice for polymer solution casting is silicone urethane copolymers, which are among the most biocompatible synthetic materials. This class of medical grade material was developed for long-term implantable device applications and offers the physical characteristics of high elongation, low modulus of elasticity, excellent recovery, and resistance to chemicals, oil, and UV light.\n\nWhile there exists a number of materials to choose from while deploying polymer solution casting technology, the material science work continues in the areas of wall thickness, strength, lubricity, biocompatibility and clarity as well as interactions of the liquid polymers with extruded and injection molded components.\n\n\n"}

Process chemistry is distinguished from medicinal chemistry, which is the arm of pharmaceutical chemistry tasked with designing and synthesizing molecules on small scale in the early drug discovery phase.\n\nMedicinal chemists are largely concerned with synthesizing a large number of compounds as quickly as possible from easily tunable chemical building blocks (usually for SAR studies). In general, the repertoire of reactions utilized in discovery chemistry is somewhat narrow (for example, the Buchwald-Hartwig amination, Suzuki coupling and reductive amination are commonplace reactions). In contrast, process chemists are tasked with identifying a chemical process that is safe, cost and labor efficient, “green,” and reproducible, among other considerations. Oftentimes, in searching for the shortest, most efficient synthetic route, process chemists must devise creative synthetic solutions that eliminate costly functional group manipulations and oxidation/reduction steps.\n\nThis article focuses exclusively on the chemical and manufacturing processes associated with the production of small molecule drugs. Biological medical products (more commonly called “biologics”) represent a growing proportion of approved therapies, but the manufacturing processes of these products are beyond the scope of this article. Additionally, the many complex factors associated with chemical plant engineering (for example, heat transfer and reactor design) and drug formulation will be treated cursorily.\n\nCost efficiency is of paramount importance in process chemistry and, consequently, is a focus in the consideration of pilot plant synthetic routes. The drug substance that is manufactured, prior to formulation, is commonly referred to as the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and will be referred to as such herein. API production cost can be broken into two components: the “material cost” and the “conversion cost.” The ecological and environmental impact of a synthetic process should also be evaluated by an appropriate metric (e.g. the EcoScale).\n\nAn ideal process chemical route will score well in each of these metrics, but inevitably tradeoffs are to be expected. Most large pharmaceutical process chemistry and manufacturing divisions have devised weighted quantitative schemes to measure the overall attractiveness of a given synthetic route over another. As cost is a major driver, material cost and volume-time output are typically weighted heavily.\n\nThe material cost of a chemical process is the sum of the costs of all raw materials, intermediates, reagents, solvents and catalysts procured from external vendors. Material costs may influence the selection of one synthetic route over another or the decision to outsource production of an intermediate.\n\nThe conversion cost of a chemical process is a factor of that procedure's overall efficiency, both in materials and time, and its reproducibility. The efficiency of a chemical process can be quantified by its atom economy, yield, volume-time output, and environmental factor (E-factor), and its reproducibility can be evaluated by the Quality Service Level (QSL) and Process Excellence Index (PEI) metrics.\n\nThe atom economy of a reaction is defined as the number of atoms from the starting materials that are incorporated into the final product. Atom economy can be viewed as an indicator of the “efficiency” of a given synthetic route.\n\nformula_1\n\nFor example, the Claisen rearrangement and the Diels-Alder cycloaddition are examples of reaction that are 100 percent atom economical. On the other hand, a prototypical Wittig reaction has especially poor atom economy (merely 20 percent in the example shown).\n\nProcess synthetic routes should be designed such that atom economy is maximized for the entire synthetic scheme. Consequently, “costly” reagents such as protecting groups and high molecular weight leaving groups should be avoided where possible. An atom economy value in the range of 70 to 90 percent for an API synthesis is ideal, but it may be impractical or impossible to access certain complex targets within this range. Nevertheless, atom economy is a good metric to compare two routes to the same molecule.\n\nYield is defined as the amount of product obtained in a chemical reaction the yield of practical significance in process chemistry is the isolated yield—the yield of the isolated product after all purification steps. In a final API synthesis, isolated yields of 80 percent or above for each synthetic step are expected. The definition of an acceptable yield depends entirely on the importance of the product and the ways in which available technologies come together to allow their efficient application; yields approaching 100% are termed quantitative, and yields above 90% are broadly understood as excellent.\n\nThere are several strategies that are employed in the design of a process route to ensure adequate overall yield of the pharmaceutical product. The first is the concept of convergent synthesis. Assuming a very good to excellent yield in each synthetic step, the overall yield of a multistep reaction can be maximized by combining several key intermediates at a late stage that are prepared independently from each other.\n\nAnother strategy to maximize isolated yield (as well as time efficiency) is the concept of telescoping synthesis (also called one-pot synthesis). This approach describes the process of eliminating workup and purification steps from a reaction sequence, typically by simply adding reagents sequentially to a reactor. In this way, unnecessary losses from these steps can be avoided.\n\nFinally, to minimize overall cost, synthetic steps involving expensive reagents, solvents or catalysts should be designed into the process route as late stage as possible, to minimize the amount of reagent used.\n\nIn a pilot plant or manufacturing plant setting, yield can have a profound effect on the material cost of an API synthesis, so the careful planning of a robust route and the fine-tuning of reaction conditions are crucially important. After a synthetic route has been selected, process chemists will subject each step to exhaustive optimization in order to maximize overall yield. Low yields are typically indicative of unwanted side product formation, which can raise red flags in the regulatory process as well as pose challenges for reactor cleaning operations.\n\nThe volume-time output (VTO) of a chemical process represents the cost of occupancy of a chemical reactor for a particular process or API synthesis. For example, a high VTO indicates that a particular synthetic step is costly in terms of “reactor hours” used for a given output. Mathematically, the VTO for a particular process is calculated by the total volume of all reactors (m) that are occupied times the hours per batch divided by the output for that batch of API or intermediate (measured in kg).\n\nThe process chemistry group at Boehringer-Ingelheim, for example, targets a VTO of less than 1 for any given synthetic step or chemical process.\n\nAdditionally, the raw conversion cost of an API synthesis (in dollars per batch) can be calculated from the VTO, given the operating cost and usable capacity of a particular reactor. Oftentimes, for large-volume APIs, it is economical to build a dedicated production plant rather than to use space in general pilot plants or manufacturing plants.\n\nBoth of these measures, which capture the environmental impact of a synthetic reaction, intend to capture the significant and rising cost of waste disposal in the manufacturing process. The E-factor for an entire API process is computed by the ratio of the total mass of waste generated in the synthetic scheme to the mass of product isolated.\n\nformula_4\n\nA similar measure, the process mass intensity (PMI) calculates the ratio of the total mass of materials to the mass of the isolated product.\n\nformula_5\n\nFor both metrics, all materials used in all synthetic steps, including reaction and workup solvents, reagents and catalysts, are counted, even if solvents or catalysts are recycled in practice. Inconsistencies in E-factor or PMI computations may arise when choosing to consider the waste associated with the synthesis of outsourced intermediates or common reagents. Additionally, the environmental impact of the generated waste is ignored in this calculation; therefore, the environmental quotient (EQ) metric was devised, which multiplies the E-factor by an “unfriendliness quotient” associated with various waste streams. A reasonable target for the E-factor or PMI of a single synthetic step is any value between 10 and 40.\n\nThe final two \"conversion cost\" considerations involve the reproducibility of a given reaction or API synthesis route. The quality service level (QSL) is a measure of the reproducibility of the quality of the isolated intermediate or final API. While the details of computing this value are slightly nuanced and unimportant for the purposes of this article, in essence, the calculation involves the ratio of satisfactory quality batches to the total number of batches. A reasonable QSL target is 98 to 100 percent.\n\nLike the QSL, the process excellence index (PEI) is a measure of process reproducibility. Here, however, the robustness of the procedure is evaluated in terms of yield and cycle time of various operations. The PEI yield is defined as follows:\n\nformula_6\n\nIn practice, if a process is high-yielding and has a narrow distribution of yield outcomes, then the PEI should be very high. Processes that are not easily reproducible may have a higher aspiration level yield and a lower average yield, lowering the PEI yield.\n\nSimilarly, a PEI cycle time may be defined as follows:\n\nformula_7\n\nFor this expression, the terms are inverted to reflect the desirability of shorter cycle times (as opposed to higher yields). The reproducibility of cycle times for critical processes such as reaction, centrifugation or drying may be critical if these operations are rate-limiting in the manufacturing plant setting. For example, if an isolation step is particularly difficult or slow, it could become the bottleneck for an API synthesis, in which case the reproducibility and optimization of that operation become critical.\n\nFor an API manufacturing process, all PEI metrics (yield and cycle times) should be targeted at 98 to 100 percent.\n\nIn 2006, Van Aken, et al. developed a quantitative framework to evaluate the safety and ecological impact of a chemical process, as well as minor weighting of practical and economical considerations. Others have modified this EcoScale by adding, subtracting and adjusting the weighting of various metrics. Among other factors, the EcoScale takes into account the toxicity, flammability and explosive stability of reagents used, any nonstandard or potentially hazardous reaction conditions (for example, elevated pressure or inert atmosphere), and reaction temperature. Some EcoScale criteria are redundant with previously considered criteria (e.g. E-factor).\n\nMacrocyclization is a recurrent challenge for process chemists, and large pharmaceutical companies have necessarily developed creative strategies to overcome these inherent limitations. An interesting case study in this area involves the development of novel NS3 protease inhibitors to treat Hepatitis C patients by scientists at Boehringer-Ingelheim. The process chemistry team at BI was tasked with developing a cheaper and more efficient route to the active NS3 inhibitor BI 201302, a close analog of BILN 2061. Two significant shortcomings were immediately identified with the initial scale-up route to BILN 2061, depicted in the scheme below. The macrocyclization step posed four challenges inherent to the cross-metathesis reaction.\n\n\nAdditionally, the final double S2 sequence to install the quinoline heterocycle was identified as a secondary inefficiency in the synthetic route.\n\nAnalysis of the cross-methathesis reaction revealed that the conformation of the acyclic precursor had a profound impact on the formation of dimers and oligomers in the reaction mixture. By installing a Boc protecting group at the C-4 amide nitrogen, the Boehringer-Ingelheim chemists were able to shift the site of initiation from the vinylcyclopropane moiety to the nonenoic acid moiety, improving the rate of the intramolecular reaction and decreasing the risk of epimerization. Additionally, the catalyst employed was switched from the expensive 1st generation Hoveyda catalyst to the more reactive, less expensive Grela catalyst. These modifications allowed the process chemists to run the reaction at a standard reaction dilution of 0.1-0.2 M, given that the rates of competing dimerization and oligomerization reactions was so dramatically reduced.\n\nAdditionally, the process chemistry team envisioned a SAr strategy to install the quinoline heterocycle, instead of the S2 strategy that they had employed for the synthesis of BILN 2061. This modification prevented the need for inefficient double inversion by proceeding through retention of stereochemistry at the C-4 position of the hydroxyproline moiety.\n\nIt is interesting to examine this case study from a VTO perspective. For the unoptimized cross-metathesis reaction using the Grela catalyst at 0.01 M diene, the reaction yield was determined to be 82 percent after a reaction and workup time of 48 hours. A 6-cubic meter reactor filled to 80% capacity afforded 35 kg of desired product. For the unoptimized reaction:\n\nformula_8\n\nThis VTO value was considered prohibitively high and a steep investment in a dedicated plant would have been necessary even before launching Phase III trials with this API, given its large projected annual demand. But after reaction development and optimization, the process team was able to improve the reaction yield to 93 percent after just 1 hour (plus 12 hours for workup and reactor cleaning time) at a diene concentration of 0.2 M. With these modifications, a 6-cubic meter reactor filled to 80% capacity afforded 799 kg of desired product. For this optimized reaction:\n\nformula_9\n\nThus, after optimization, this synthetic step became less costly in terms of equipment and time and more practical to perform in a standard manufacturing facility, eliminating the need for a costly investment in a new dedicated plant.\n\nRecently, large pharmaceutical process chemists have relied heavily on the development of enzymatic reactions to produce important chiral building blocks for API synthesis. Many varied classes of naturally occurring enzymes have been co-opted and engineered for process pharmaceutical chemistry applications. The widest range of applications come from ketoreductases and transaminases, but there are isolated examples from hydrolases, aldolases, oxidative enzymes, esterases and dehalogenases, among others.\n\nOne of the most prominent uses of biocatalysis in process chemistry today is in the synthesis of Januvia®, a DPP-4 inhibitor developed by Merck for the management of type II diabetes. The traditional process synthetic route involved a late-stage enamine formation followed by rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation to afford the API sitagliptin. This process suffered from a number of limitations, including the need to run the reaction under a high-pressure hydrogen environment, the high cost of a transition-metal catalyst, the difficult process of carbon treatment to remove trace amounts of catalyst and insufficient stereoselectivity, requiring a subsequent recrystallization step before final salt formation.\n\nMerck’s process chemistry department contracted Codexis, a medium-sized biocatalysis firm, to develop a large-scale biocatalytic reductive amination for the final step of its sitagliptin synthesis. Codexis engineered a transaminase enzyme from the bacteria Arthrobacter through 11 rounds of directed evolution. The engineered transaminase contained 27 individual point mutations and displayed activity four orders of magnitude greater than the parent enzyme. Additionally, the enzyme was engineered to handle high substrate concentrations (100 g/L) and to tolerate the organic solvents, reagents and byproducts of the transamination reaction. This biocatalytic route successfully avoided the limitations of the chemocatalyzed hydrogenation route: the requirements to run the reaction under high pressure, to remove excess catalyst by carbon treatment and to recrystallize the product due to insufficient enantioselectivity were obviated by the use of a biocatalyst. Merck and Codexis were awarded the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Award in 2010 for the development of this biocatalytic route toward Januvia®.\n\nIn recent years, much progress has been made in the development and optimization of flow reactors for small-scale chemical synthesis (the Jamison Group at MIT and Ley Group at Cambridge University, among others, have pioneered efforts in this field). The pharmaceutical industry, however, has been slow to adopt this technology for large-scale synthetic operations. For certain reactions, however, continuous processing may possess distinct advantages over batch processing in terms of safety, quality and throughput.\n\nA case study of particular interest involves the development of a fully continuous process by the process chemistry group at Eli Lilly and Company for an asymmetric hydrogenation to access a key intermediate in the synthesis of LY500307, a potent ERβ agonist that is entering clinical trials for the treatment of patients with schizophrenia, in addition to a regimen of standard antipsychotic medications. In this key synthetic step, a chiral rhodium-catalyst is used for the enantioselective reduction of a tetrasubstituted olefin. After extensive optimization, it was found that in order to reduce the catalyst loading to a commercially practical level, the reaction required hydrogen pressure up to 70 atm. The pressure limit of a standard chemical reactor is about 10 atm, although high-pressure batch reactors may be acquired at significant capital cost for reactions up to 100 atm. Especially for an API in the early stages of chemical development, such an investment clearly bears a large risk.\n\nAn additional concern was that the hydrogenation product has an unfavorable eutectic point, so it was impossible to isolate the crude intermediate in more than 94 percent ee by batch process. Because of this limitation, the process chemistry route toward LY500307 necessarily involved a kinetically controlled crystallization step after the hydrogenation to upgrade the enantiopurity of this penultimate intermediate to >99 percent ee.\n\nThe process chemistry team at Eli Lilly successfully developed a fully continuous process to this penultimate intermediate, including reaction, workup and kinetically controlled crystallization modules (the engineering considerations implicit in these efforts are beyond the scope of this article). An advantage of flow reactors is that high-pressure tubing can be utilized for hydrogenation and other hyperbaric reactions. Because the head space of a batch reactor is eliminated, however, many of the safety concerns associated with running high-pressure reactions are obviated by the use of a continuous process reactor. Additionally, a two-stage mixed suspension-mixed product removal (MSMPR) module was designed for the scalable, continuous, kinetically controlled crystallization of the product, so it was possible to isolate in >99 percent ee, eliminating the need for an additional batch crystallization step.\n\nThis continuous process afforded 144 kg of the key intermediate in 86 percent yield, comparable with a 90 percent isolated yield using the batch process. This 73-liter pilot-scale flow reactor (occupying less than 0.5 m space) achieved the same weekly throughput as theoretical batch processing in a 400-liter reactor. Therefore, the continuous flow process demonstrates advantages in safety, efficiency (eliminates the need for batch crystallization) and throughput, compared with a theoretical batch process.\n\nInstitute of Process Research & Development, University of Leeds\n"}

United States\" but a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the evacuation.\n\nIn 1943, during the period of war and evacuation, an amendment to the California Fish and Game Code was adopted prohibiting issuance of a license to any \"alien Japanese.\" In 1945, the state code was again amended by striking the 1943 provision for fear that it might be \"declared unconstitutional\" because directed only \"against alien Japanese\"; the new amendment banned issuance of licenses to any \"person ineligible to citizenship,\" which classification included Japanese. Cal. Stats. 1945, ch. 181. Because of this state provision barring issuance of commercial fishing licenses to persons ineligible for citizenship under federal law, Takahashi, who met all other state requirements, was denied a license by the California Fish and Game Commission upon his return to California in 1945.\n\nTakahashi, an alien ineligible for citizenship, brought an action for mandamus in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California, to compel the Commission to issue him a commercial fishing license.\n\nThe Superior Court first ordered issuance of a commercial fishing license authorizing Takahashi to bring ashore \"catches of fish from the waters of the high seas beyond the State's territorial jurisdiction.\"\n\nAfter appeal to the State Supreme Court by the State Commission the Superior Court amended its judgment so as to order a commercial license authorizing Takahashi to bring in catches of fish taken from the three-mile ocean belt adjacent to the California coast as well as from the high seas. It held that lawful alien inhabitants of California, despite their ineligibility to citizenship, were entitled to engage in the vocation of commercial fishing on the high seas beyond the three-mile belt on the same terms as other lawful state inhabitants, and that the California code provision denying them this right violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\nA judgment granting the writ was reversed by the State Supreme Court, three judges dissenting.\n\nThe Court held that California had a proprietary interest in fish in the ocean waters within three miles of the shore, and that this interest justified the State in barring all aliens in general and aliens ineligible to citizenship in particular from catching fish within or without the three-mile coastal belt and bringing them to California for commercial purposes. 30 Cal. 2d 719, 185 P. 2d 805.\n\nThe state court held that this interest justified the state in barring all aliens in general, and aliens ineligible for citizenship in particular, from catching fish within or without the three-mile coastal belt and bringing them into the state for commercial purposes.\n\nThe Supreme Court granted certiorari. 333 U.S. 853, \"to review this question of importance in the fields of federal-state relationships and of constitutionally protected individual equality and liberty\".\n\nThe Court reversed. Justice Black was joined by six other justices.\n\nIt held that the California statute forbidding the issuance of commercial fishing licenses to aliens ineligible to citizenship was held to violate the constitutional right of such aliens to the equal protection of the laws. The contention that the statute might be supported as a conservation measure was rejected. The state could not, consistent with the United States Constitution, use federally created racial ineligibility for citizenship as a basis for barring petitioner from earning his living as a commercial fisherman in the ocean water off the state coast. The refusal to issue petitioner a commercial fishing license violated U.S. Const. amend. XIV, and there was no special public interest to support the state ban on petitioner's commercial fishing.\n\nA state prohibition of the issuance of commercial fishing licenses to persons ineligible to citizenship makes an unreasonable classification in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (distinguishing \"Terrace v. Thompson\", 263 US 197; \"Porterfield v. Webb\", 263 US 225; \"Webb v. O'Brien\", 263 US 313; and \"Frick v. Webb\", 263 US 326).\n\n1. A California statute barring issuance of commercial fishing licenses to persons \"ineligible to citizenship,\" which classification included resident alien Japanese and precluded such a one from earning his living as a commercial fisherman in the ocean waters off the coast of the State, held invalid under the Federal Constitution and laws. pp. 412–422.\n\n2. For purposes of decision by this Court, it may be assumed that the object of the statute was to conserve fish in the coastal waters of the State, or to protect citizens of the State engaged in commercial fishing from the competition of Japanese aliens, or both. P. 418.\n\n3. That the United States regulates immigration and naturalization in part on the basis of race and color classifications does not authorize adoption by a State of such classifications to prevent lawfully admitted aliens within its borders from earning a livelihood by means open to all other inhabitants. pp. 418–420.\n\n4. The Fourteenth Amendment and federal laws, 8 U. S. C. § 41, embody a general policy that all persons lawfully in this country shall abide \"in any state\" on an equality of legal privileges with all citizens under non-discriminatory laws. pp. 419–420.\n\n5. Whatever may be the interest of the State or its citizens in the fish in the 3-mile belt offshore, that interest does not justify the State in excluding any or all aliens who are lawful residents of the State from making a living by fishing in the ocean off its shores while permitting all other persons to do so. pp. 420–421.\n\n6. Assuming their continued validity, cases sustaining state laws barring land ownership by aliens ineligible to citizenship, which rested on grounds peculiar to real property, can not be extended to control the decision in this case. P. 422.\n\nJustice Murphy, joined by Rutledge, expressed agreement with these views, but thought that the statute should also be condemned as being the direct outgrowth of antagonism toward persons of Japanese ancestry and as having no relation whatever to any constitutionally cognizable interest of California.\n\nJustice Reed, joined by Jackson, dissented on the ground that a state has the power to exclude all aliens from enjoyment of its natural resources, including its fisheries, and that a classification excluding such aliens as are ineligible to citizenship is not unreasonable.\n\n"}

The concept of \"techsourcing\" has occurred across many industries for many years, however the phrase was coined by George Tosh, Principle Software Engineer for Salesforce in 2016. Techsourcing might include the use of robotics, or dedicated purpose-built machines to complete a task, but not always.\n\nA popular example of techsourcing is the ATM or “Automated Teller Machine”. The ATM performs many of the tasks that human bank tellers performed. It has allowed banks and other financial institutions to increase customer satisfaction through decreased wait times, but often at the cost of job opportunities for humans. Techsourcing usually occurs for jobs and roles that cannot be outsourced due to the specific nature of the job.\n\nIn 2015, and continuing into 2016, the push for a $15/hour minimum wage among many minimum wage earners has increased fears among economists that increasing the minimum wage will only lead to jobs being “techsourced”, automated, or eliminated entirely. It should be noted that minimum wage jobs are not the only jobs at risk for being techsourced. In Belgium two hospitals have employed robots as receptionists to offer directions and assist patients, jobs that previously would have been filled by humans.\n"}
{"id": "35762929", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=35762929", "title": "The Functions of the Executive", "text": "The Functions of the Executive\n\nThe Functions of the Executive is a book by Chester I. Barnard (1886–1961) that presents a \"theory of cooperation and organization\" and \"a study of the functions and of the methods of operation of executives in formal organizations.\" It was originally published in 1938; a Thirtieth Anniversary edition, published in 1968, is still in print.\n\nThe book is notable for its focus on how organizations actually operate, instead of previous approaches to organizations that emphasized \"prescriptive principles.\" It has been praised for being one of the first books to consider leadership from a social and psychological viewpoint. An article in \"Public Administration Review\" reported that an informal advisory panel voted it one of the most influential books in public administration published between 1940 and 1990. It was voted the second most influential management book of the 20th century in a poll of the Fellows of the Academy of Management, behind \"The Principles of Scientific Management\" by Frederick Winslow Taylor.\n\nBarnard attended Harvard University between 1906 and 1909 where he majored in economics; however, he did not obtain a degree. After rising through the ranks at AT&T Corporation, Barnard became president of New Jersey Bell between 1927 and 1948. At New Jersey Bell, Barnard enjoyed \"long hours of self-absorbed reflection and study.\"\n\nIn 1936, Barnard gave a lecture at Princeton University entitled \"Mind in Everyday Affairs.\" In the lecture, Barnard described the differences between \"logical\" and \"non-logical\" (i.e., \"intuitional\") mental processes. He encouraged the use of non-logical processes \"for many conditions and purposes.\"\n\nBarnard had many contacts with Harvard officials, for example in relation to fundraising activities. He and Lawrence Joseph Henderson were friends, and Henderson was a friend of Abbott Lawrence Lowell, who had been president of Harvard and founder of the Lowell Institute. Henderson suggested that Lowell invite Barnard to lecture at the Institute, and having read \"Mind in Everyday Affairs\" and another lecture by Barnard, Lowell did so. Barnard gave eight extemporaneous talks at the Lowell Institute in 1937 on the topic of \"functions of the executive,\" and on the invitation of Dumas Malone (the director of Harvard University Press who met Barnard through Arthur W. Page), he revised the material from the talks to create the book.\n\nBarnard's philosophy and thought processes in writing the book were characterized by humanism, empiricism, speculative philosophy (the interpretation of experience in a coherent framework), and analysis of the dichotomy of individualism and collectivism. As cited in the book, his intellectual influences included Arthur F. Bentley, Vilfredo Pareto, Lawrence Joseph Henderson, Talcott Parsons, W. H. R. Rivers, Frederic Bartlett, Elton Mayo, Fritz Roethlisberger, Mary Parker Follett, James Harbord, Alfred North Whitehead, and John R. Commons. His approach diverged from the \"mechanistic conceptions\" of Frederick Winslow Taylor and Henri Fayol.\n\nIn the 1968 edition, the Introduction by Kenneth R. Andrews evaluates the book and summarizes its place in the management literature. Andrews concludes that it is \"the most thought-provoking book on organization and management ever written by a practicing executive.\" He contrasts \"Functions of the Executive\" with the \"classical\" approaches to organizations found in books such as \"Principles of Management\" by Harold Koontz and Cyril J. O'Donnell.\n\nBarnard gives an overview of his arguments in his Preface:\nFormally this work is divided into four parts, but in a sense it consists of two short treatises. One is an exposition of a theory of cooperation and organization and constitutes the first half of the book. The second is a study of the functions and of the methods of operation of executives in formal organizations.\n\nPart I is \"Preliminary Considerations Concerning Cooperative Systems.\"\n\nIn Chapter I, \"Introduction\" (pages 3–7), Barnard notes that \"formal organization is that kind of cooperation among men that is conscious, deliberate, purposeful,\" and that \"successful cooperation in or by formal organizations is the abnormal, not the normal, condition.\" An individual may belong to many formal organizations, some of which may be short-lived.\n\nChapter II, \"The Individual and Organization\" (pages 8–15), states that individuals can be characterized in many ways (e.g., physical, social, psychological), but that for the purposes of discussion the book is concerned with the functional relationships among individuals in organizations. Barnard distinguishes between \"effective\" and \"efficient\" actions:\nWhen a specific desired end is attained we shall say that the action is \"effective.\" When the unsought consequences of the action are more important than the attainment of the desired end and are dissatisfactory, effective action, we shall say, is \"inefficient.\" When the unsought consequences are unimportant or trivial, the action is \"efficient.\"\n\nThe remaining chapters in Part I elaborate on the relationships among people in a \"cooperative system\":\n\nThe book's second part concerns \"The Theory and Structure of Formal Organizations.\"\n\nPages 65–81 contain Chapter VI, \"The Definition of Formal Organization.\" In the chapter, Barnard defines \"formal organization\" twice as \"a system of consciously coordinated activities or forces of two or more persons.\" The chapter outlines how Barnard developed the definition and explains that the concept of organization is abstract. It specifies that a formal organization is part of a \"cooperative system,\" a \"complex of physical, biological, personal, and social components which are in a specific systematic relationship by reason of the cooperation of two or more persons for at least one definite end.\"\n\nChapter VII, \"The Theory of Formal Organization\" on pages 82–95, sets forth the three elements necessary for organizations: \"(1) communication; (2) willingness to serve; and (3) common purpose.\" Barnard suggests both: (1) that an organization that cannot accomplish its purpose cannot survive, and (2) that an organization that accomplishes its purpose has no reason for existence. Therefore, organizations are constantly adopting new purposes.\n\nChapter VIII, \"The Structure of Complex Formal Organizations\" (pages 96–113), concerns the relationship of \"superior\" to \"subordinate\" organizations, the growth of organizations, and the relationship of small working \"unit organizations\" to \"executive organizations\" within complex formal organizations.\n\nIn Chapter IX, \"Informal Organizations and Their Relation to Formal Organizations\" (pages 114-123), Barnard states that formal organizations coexist with informal organizations (groups of people who interact with each other outside a formal organizational structure). Benefits of informal organizations include the promotion of communication, cohesiveness, and self-respect.\n\nPart III is titled \"The Elements of Formal Organizations\" and begins with Chapter X (pages 127-138) about \"The Bases and Kinds of Specializations.\"\n\n\"The Economy of Incentives\" is Chapter XI (pages 139-160). According to Barnard, \"in all sorts of organizations the affording of adequate incentives becomes the most definitely emphasized task in their existence\" Specific inducements range from \"material inducements\" to \"ideal benefactions\" (e.g., \"pride of workmanship\"), while \"general incentives\" include \"personal comfort in social relations.\" Barnard's conclusions on incentives were drawn \"almost entirely from observations… not from any reading.\"\n\nChapter XII, \"The Theory of Authority\" (pages 161-184) is notable for its summary of the conditions for authoritative communications, its explanation of \"zone of indifference,\" and its distinction between \"authority of position\" and \"authority of leadership.\"\nA person can and will accept a communication as authoritative only when four conditions simultaneously obtain: (a) he can and does understand the communication; (b) \"at the time of his decision\" he believes that it is not inconsistent with the purpose of the organization; (c) \"at the time of his decision\", he believes it to be compatible with his personal interest as a whole; and (d) he is able mentally and physically to comply with it.\n...there exists a \"zone of indifference\" in each individual within which orders are acceptable without conscious questioning of their authority… The zone of indifference will be wider or narrower depending upon the degree to which the inducements exceed the burdens and sacrifices which determine the individual's adhesion to the organization. It follows that the range of orders that will be accepted will be very limited among those who are barely induced to contribute to the system.\n\nIn Chapter XIII, \"The Environment of Decision\" (pages 185-199), Barnard contemplates how personal decision-making and organizational decision-making differ. He states \"The fine art of executive decision consists in not deciding questions that are not now pertinent, in not deciding prematurely, in not making decision that cannot be made effective, and in not making decisions that others should make.\"\n\nPart III concludes with Chapter XIV, \"The Theory of Opportunism\" (pages 200-211).\n\n\"The Functions of Organizations in Cooperative Systems\" constitutes the final part of the book. It begins with Chapter XV (\"The Executive Functions,\" pages 215-234) and Chapter XVI (\"The Executive Process,\" pages 235-257).\n\nChapter XVII on \"The Nature of Executive Responsibility\" (pages 258-284) discusses morality. Barnard observes that \"cooperation, not leadership, is the creative process; but leadership is the indispensable fulminator of its forces.\" In turn, morality is critical to leadership: \"organizations endure… in proportion to the breadth of the morality by which they are governed.\"\n\nThe \"Conclusion\" (Chapter XVIII, pages 285-296) highlights 16 major observations of the book and contemplates the relationship of science and art in management:\nI believe that the expansion of cooperation and the development of the individual are mutually dependent realities, and that a due proportion or balance between them is a necessary condition of human welfare. Because it is subjective with respect both to a society as a whole and to the individual, what this proportion is I believe science cannot say. It is a question for philosophy and religion.\n\nThe Appendix (pages 301-322) contains the text of Barnard's 1936 \"Mind in Everyday Affairs\" lecture.\n\nCriticisms of the book include:\n\n\"The Functions of the Executive\" was to be the only book that Barnard ever wrote; however, he also wrote articles for journals, and collections of such articles have been published in books (e.g., the 1948 book \"Organization and Management\"). By 2010, the book had received over 8,000 citations in Google Scholar. Among other works, the book influenced:\nOf course I built squarely on Barnard, and have always felt deeply indebted to him; science is a cumulative endeavor. My general debt is expressed in the acknowledgements [p. xivii of the Second Edition]: \"To Mr. Charles [sic] I. Barnard I owe a special debt: first, for his own book \"The Functions of the Executive\".…\" In the book itself there are fourteen references to Barnard…. the notions of the contribution-inducement equilibrium, authority, and zone of acceptance were all derived from Barnard…. What I would now regard as the principal novelties in \"Behavior\" are the development of the concept of organizational identification…, the description of the decision process in terms of the processing of decision premises, and the bounded rationality notions…. Most of the rest is highly \"Barnardian,\" and certainly even those \"novel\" ideas are in no way inconsistent with Barnard's view of organizations.\nBarnard's book also anticipated \"In Search of Excellence\" by Tom Peters and Robert H. Waterman, Jr., the concept of management by objectives that Peter Drucker popularized, the two-factor theory of Frederick Herzberg, and Maslow's hierarchy of needs.\n\nExamples of papers that have examined Barnard's \"zones of indifference\" concept include:\n\nAs of 1961, the book had sold over 35,000 copies. As of 1982, the book had gone through 29 printings, and the Thirtieth Anniversary edition is still in print. It has been translated into many languages, including Arabic, Chinese, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, and Turkish.\n\nIn 1988, the University of California, Berkeley held a series of seminars to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the book's publication; eight of the lectures became essays in a 1995 book edited by Oliver E. Williamson. One issue of the \"International Journal of Public Administration\" in 1994 contained papers in honor of Barnard, many of which concerned the book. Joseph T. Mahoney of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign wrote that \"The Functions of the Executive\" \"is the most high-powered intellectual contribution to organization or economic theory ever written by a practicing manager\" and that it appears to inspire students by conveying an \"aesthetic feeling of managing.\"\n\nAlthough an informal advisory panel voted \"Administrative Behavior\" by Herbert Simon the most influential 1940–1990 book in academic public administration, \"panel members had a tendency to associate Simon and Barnard,\" and one panel member wrote that Barnard's book was \"the truly seminal work.\" \"The Functions of the Executive\" appeared in at least four lists of \"best\" or \"most influential\" management and business books between 2001 and 2011.\n\n\n"}

The company commercialised a genetic test to determine whether a cow will produce milk without the A1 protein, and to market a2 Milk.\n\nInitially, A2 Corporation focused on dairy farm breeding programs to develop herds that would produce only a2 milk. However the launch of a2 milk was delayed by opposition from Fonterra, which had protected contracts under New Zealand law with about 98% of New Zealand dairy farms. Seeking leverage in the battle with Fonterra over access to farmers, and over patent rights, Paterson led the company into litigation against Fonterra, asking the New Zealand High Court to order Fonterra to put health warnings on its conventional milk concerning risks of type 1 diabetes, heart disease, autism and schizophrenia due to the presence of A1 beta-casein, and to force Fonterra to publicly disclose all the information it had about the links between A1 beta-casein and health risks. The litigation threatened New Zealand's economy and international reputation as at the time Fonterra was responsible for 20% of New Zealand's exports. The press over the litigation and public concern over the claims of A2 Corporation led the New Zealand Food Safety Authority and the Ministry of Health and the Food Standards Australia New Zealand to issue statements confirming the safety of conventional milk.\n\nA2 Corporation was able to obtain agreements with enough dairy farmers to launch A2 milk in New Zealand at the end of April 2003. In the middle of 2003, both founders of the company died. In July, Paterson was found dead in his hotel room during a business trip at the age of 50, and a month later Dr Corran McLachlan died of cancer at the age of 59. In New Zealand it is illegal to make health claims about a food product without providing scientific evidence and registering the food as a medicine, and in November 2003 the New Zealand Commerce Commission advised that A2 Corporation Ltd and its licensed A2 producers had agreed to amend the health claims in their promotional material following a warning from the commission. By end of 2003 the weakened A2 Corporation had withdrawn the litigation against Fonterra and negotiations had resumed.\n\nThe company, which had been in a tenuous financial situation since beginning trading in May, went into administration in October and was liquidated in November, owing farmers and processors tens of thousands of dollars. A $1.27 million federal government grant awarded to the company in August as part of the Regional Partnerships Program was also cancelled. A2 Corporation set up a new subsidiary and licensee, A2 Australia, to market and produce its product. A2 Australia established new contracts with the dairy farmers who had A2 herds, promising better payment terms—a week in advance instead of once per month, after shipment.\n\nIn December, A2 Corporation sold its interests in A2 Australia to Fraser & Neave, a food marketing giant in Asian markets, for about $1.1 million. A2 Corporation had lost about $1.3 million for 2004, the same as it has lost the year before; the sale allowed A2 Corporation to rely on Fraser & Neave to build the Australian and Asian businesses. A2 Corporation focused on recovering from the deaths of its founders organizationally and financially, relied on its New Zealand licensees to develop the New Zealand market, and turned its focus to developing overseas markets.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2006, A2 Corporation business continued to grow. Dairy Australia, the national association of the Australian dairy industry, and market competitors like Parmalat in response have consistently stated that there is no conclusive scientific evidence to suggest A1 proteins are dangerous and have warned that criticism of normal milk is damaging the entire dairy industry.\n\nIn 2006, A2 Corporation was on sound enough footing to buy back A2 Australia from Fraser & Neave. In 2006, it lost about $1 million, after having lost $9 million the year before, but revenues had approximately doubled. In that year it warned shareholders not to expect profit for another three years.\n\nCommercial development proceeded, and by 2010 some 40 million litres of a2 Milk were being produced by 12,000 A2-certified cows across Australia, with milk processed at four plants in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, and yoghurt made with a2 Milk went on the market in Australia in April 2010.\n\nIn February 2011 A2 Corporation announced it had a made a profit over a half-year for the first time; in the six months ending 31 December 2010, it made a net $894,000, or 17 cents/share.\n\nIn December 2012 A2 Corporation announced it would attempt to raise $20 million and list on the New Zealand Stock Exchange main board, and that it would use the funds to grow its Chinese infant formula and UK milk businesses. It listed in March 2013.\n\nIn 2015, a2 Milk whole milk powder and a2 Milk Ice Cream products were launched. For the 2014–2015 Financial year, The a2 Milk Company reported its Australian and New Zealand segment revenue grew by 40% vs pcp; and sales on a2 infant formula increased by 650%.\n\nIn December 2017 the company announced that in the summer of 2018 Geoffrey Babidge, who had been nearing retirement age, would step down and Jayne Hrdlicka would take over as CEO; at that time she was CEO of Jetstar Airways. She took over in July 2018. At that time the company was experiencing strong growth via sales in China and had ramped up spending to further increase Chinese sales and to expand the US market.\n\na2 claims that milk containing A1 proteins are harmful, but a 2009 European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) review of scientific literature found there was insufficient evidence to prove that bioactive peptides in A1 milk have a negative effect on health.\n\nA1 and A2 beta-casein are genetic variants of the beta-casein milk protein that differ by one amino acid. The A1 beta-casein type is the most common type found in cow's milk in Europe (excluding France), the USA, Australia and New Zealand. A genetic test, developed by the A2 Milk Company, determines whether a cow produces the A2 or A1 type protein in its milk. The test allows the a2 Milk Company to license milk producers once proven their cows produce only A2 beta-casein protein in their milk, to the exclusion of the A1 beta-casein protein type.\n\nA2 Corporation licensed patents filed in the 1990s by the New Zealand Dairy Board, and filed its own patents on genetic tests to determine what form of beta-casein cows produce in milk, and concerning potential adverse health consequences of A1 milk.\n\nBy 2012 A2 Corporation had developed a worldwide suite of intellectual property, including trademarks, trade secrets, and patents covering products, the genetic test and methods to develop A2 producing herds, as well as methods to check the protein content and fatty acid content of milk, dietary supplements with A2 beta-casein, and even therapeutic uses of A2.\n\nThe a2 Milk Company continues to develop a portfolio of intellectual property, including trademarks and patents. The a2 Milk Company also invests in targeted research and development associated with the benefits of the A2 protein. In September 2017, It was reported that A2 Milk got approval to keep selling its products in China.\n\nSales of a2 Milk in Australia and New Zealand boosted significantly following 2007, after the publication of a book, \"Devil in the Milk\" by Keith Woodford, about A1 beta-casein and its perceived dangers to health and prompted the New Zealand Food Safety Authority to propose again reviewing the science to address consumer concerns that A1 milk might be harmful. It asked the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) to undertake such a review. The EFSA report, released in 2009, found that \"a cause and effect relationship is not established between the dietary intake of BCM7 (beta-casomorphin-7), related peptides or their possible protein precursors and non-communicable diseases”.\n\nThe a2 Milk Company launched an infant formula in New Zealand and Australia in September 2013 and a2 Milk thickened cream was launched in January 2014.\n\nA2 Corporation changed its name to The a2 Milk Company Limited effective April 2014, and at that time had about 8% market share of the milk products market in Australia.\n\nIn 2014 Lion, a beverage and food company that operates in Australia and New Zealand and is owned by Kirin, relaunched their \"Pura\" milk product with a new label stating: \"Naturally contains A2 protein.\"\n\nThe a2 Milk Company announced in November 2014 that it had begun the application process for a dual listing on the Australian Securities Exchange in a bid to open its register to Australian investors and boost the liquidity of its shares. The company successfully listed on ASX 30 March 2015.\n\nIn August 2003, The a2 Milk Company exclusively licensed patent and trademark rights to US-based Ideasphere Incorporated (ISI) to market a2 Milk products in North America. ISI acquired Twinlab in September 2003, followed by another string of acquisitions in the dietary supplement market. In June 2005, ISI and A2 Corporation agreed to form a joint venture, a2 Milk Company LLC.\n\nIn April 2007 A2 Corporation announced a deal in which the joint venture would license rights to the Original Foods Company, whose branding the a2 Milk product would carry, and in which the product would be sold in several midwestern states through the Hy-Vee supermarket chain.\n\nIn A2 Corporation's 2009 Annual Report, the company announced that the joint venture had regained all rights to the US market through a settlement with the Original Foods Company, and that \"The US dairy milk market remains intensely competitive and continues to be a major challenge.\" In 2010 The a2 Milk Company bought out all but less than 1% of ISI's share in the joint venture.\n\nThe a2 Milk Company formed a joint venture with a major British milk supplier, Müller Wiseman Dairies, in November 2011 to process, market and sell its a2 Milk products in Britain and Ireland. In June 2014 The a2 Milk Company reported it had 20 dedicated farms supplying milk for processing in the UK. In its first year the milk recorded ₤1 million in sales through 1000 stores. On 1 January 2014, The a2 Milk Company exited its joint venture with Müller Wiseman Dairies by acquiring MWD's stake for a “nominal” amount.\n\nThe first consignments of The a2 Milk Company infant formula - a2 Platinum were sent to China in 2013. Exports to China have increased dramatically following the 2008 Chinese milk scandal.\n"}
{"id": "52631", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=52631", "title": "Tobacco industry", "text": "Tobacco industry\n\nThe tobacco industry comprises those persons and companies engaged in the growth, preparation for sale, shipment, advertisement, and distribution of tobacco and tobacco-related products. It is a global industry; tobacco can grow in any warm, moist environment, which means it can be farmed on all continents except Antarctica.\n\nTobacco, one of the most widely used addictive substances in the world, is a plant native to the Americas and historically one of the half-dozen most important crops grown by American farmers. More specifically, tobacco refers to any of various plants of the genus \"Nicotiana\" (especially \"N. tabacum\") native to tropical America and widely cultivated for their leaves, which are dried and processed chiefly for smoking in pipes, cigarettes, and cigars; it is also cut to form chewing tobacco or ground to make snuff or dipping tobacco, as well as other less common preparations. From 1617 to 1793 tobacco was the most valuable staple export from the English American mainland colonies and the United States. Until the 1960s, the United States not only grew but also manufactured and exported more tobacco than any other country.\n\nTobacco is an agricultural commodity product, similar in economic terms to agricultural foodstuffs: the price is in part determined by crop yields, which vary depending on local weather conditions. The price also varies by specific species or cultivar grown, the total quantity on the market ready for sale, the area where it is grown, the health of the plants, and other characteristics individual to product quality.\n\nSince 1964 conclusive medical evidence of the deadly effects of tobacco consumption has led to a sharp decline in official support for producers and manufacturers of tobacco, although it contributes to the agricultural, fiscal, manufacturing, and exporting sectors of the economy. Laws around the world now often have some restrictions on smoking, but almost 6 trillion cigarettes are still produced each year, representing over a 12% increase since the year 2000. China accounts for over 40% of current world production. Tobacco is often heavily taxed to gain revenues for governments and as an incentive for people not to smoke.\n\nFor a history of how tobacco has been grown and marketed, see tobacco, smoking and articles on similar topics.\n\nThe phrase \"tobacco industry\" generally refers to the companies involved in the manufacture of cigarettes, cigars, snuff, chewing tobacco and pipe tobacco. China National Tobacco Co. has become the largest tobacco company in the world by volume. Following extensive merger and acquisition activity in the 1990s and 2000s, four firms dominate international markets - in alphabetical order:\n\n\nAltria, formerly called the Philip Morris Cos. (Philip Morris Companies Inc.), still owns the Philip Morris tobacco business in the United States, but Philip Morris International has been fully independent since 2008. In most countries these companies either have long-established dominance, or have purchased the major domestic producer or producers (often a former state monopoly). Until 2014 the United States had one other substantial independent firm, Lorillard, which Reynolds American, Inc. acquired. India has its own major player, ITC Limited (25.4%-owned by British American Tobacco). A small number of state monopolies survive, as well as some small independent firms.\n\nTobacco advertising is becoming increasingly restricted by the governments of countries around the world citing health issues as a reason to restrict tobaccos appeal\n\nThe tobacco industry in the United States has suffered greatly since the mid-1990s, when it was successfully sued by several U.S. states. The suits claimed that tobacco causes cancer, that companies in the industry knew this, and that they deliberately understated the significance of their findings, contributing to the illness and death of many citizens in those states.\n\nThe industry was found to have decades of internal memos confirming in detail that tobacco (which contains nicotine) is both addictive and carcinogenic (cancer-causing). The industry had long denied that nicotine is addictive.\n\nThe suit resulted in a large cash settlement being paid by a group of tobacco companies to the states that sued. Further, since the suit was settled, other individuals have come forth, in class action lawsuits, claiming individual damages. New suits of this nature will probably continue for a long time.\n\nSince the settlement is a heavy tax on the profits of the tobacco industry in the US, regressive against smokers, and further settlements being made only add to the financial burden of these companies, it is debatable if the industry has a money-producing long term outlook.\n\nThe tobacco industry has historically been largely successful in this litigation process, with the majority of cases being won by the industry. During the first 42 years of tobacco litigation (between 1954 and 1996) the industry maintained a clean record in litigation thanks to tactics described in a R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company internal memo as \"the way we won these cases, to paraphrase Gen. Patton, is not by spending all of Reynolds' money, but by making the other son of a bitch spend all of his.\" Between 1995 and 2005 only 59% of cases were won by the tobacco industry either outright or on appeal in the US, but the continued success of the industry's efforts to win these cases is questionable. In Florida, the industry has lost 77 of the 116 \"Engle progeny\" cases that have gone to trial. The U.S. Supreme Court has\nalso denied the industry's major grounds for appeal of Engle cases.\n\nIn June 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act which has been called a \"sweeping anti-smoking\" bill. Among other restrictions, this Act banned the use of any constituent, additive, herb or spice that adds a \"characterizing flavor\" to the tobacco product or smoke (Section 907)(a)(1)(A). The aim of this ban is to prevent children and teenagers from becoming addicted to cigarettes at a young age with the US Department of Health and Human Services citing that \"studies have shown that 17 year old\nsmokers are three times as likely to use flavored cigarettes as are smokers over the age of 25\". This ban however does not apply to menthol cigarettes, which are exempt from the bill.\n\nLawsuits against the tobacco industry are primarily restricted to the United States due to differences in legal systems in other countries. Many businesses class ongoing lawsuits as a cost of doing business in the US and feel their revenue will be only marginally affected by the activities.\n\nLarge tobacco companies have entered the electronic cigarette market by either buying some of the small e-cigarette companies or by starting their own e-cigarette companies.\n\nOn May 11, 2004, the U.S. became the 108th country to sign the World Health Organization's Global Treaty on Tobacco Control. This treaty places broad restrictions on the sale, advertising, shipment, and taxation of tobacco products. The U.S. has not yet ratified this treaty in its senate and does not yet have a schedule for doing so.\n\nMost recently, there has been discussion within the tobacco control community of transforming the tobacco industry through the replacement of tobacco corporations by other types of business organizations that can be established to provide tobacco to the market while not attempting to increase market demand.\n\nOn February 20, 2007, the US Supreme Court ruled that the Altria Group (formerly Philip Morris) did not have to pay $79.5 million in punitive damages awarded to Mayola Williams in a 1999 Oregon court ruling, when she sued Phillip Morris for responsibility in the cancer death of her husband, Jesse Williams. The Supreme Court's decision overturns a ruling made by the Oregon Supreme Court that upheld the award.\n\nOn April 3, 2008, The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit threw out a $800 billion class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of a group or class of people who smoked light cigarettes. The plaintiffs' lawyers were confident that they would be able to win this suit due to the success of the Schwab case wherein tobacco companies were found guilty of fraud-like charges because they were selling the idea that light cigarettes were safer than regular cigarettes. The ruling by the three-judge panel will not allow the suit to be pursued as a class, but instead need proof for why individual smokers chose light cigarettes over regular cigarettes.\n\nThe United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization estimates the following production of unprocessed tobacco by country/region in 2000. (Figures are in thousands of tonnes.)\n\nThe tobacco industry has had a long relationship with the entertainment industry. In silent era movies, back-lit smoke was often used by filmmakers to create sense of mystery and sensuality in a scene. Later, cigarettes were deliberately placed in the hands of Hollywood stars as an early phase of product placement, until health regulating bodies tightened rules on tobacco advertisement and anti-smoking groups pressured actors and studio executives against such tactics. Big Tobacco has since been the subject focus of films such as the docudrama \"The Insider\" (1999) and \"Thank You For Smoking\" (2005).\n\nThese issues have also constituted a recurring storyline in the AMC series \"Mad Men\", from season 1 beginning with the pilot episode (\"Smoke Gets In Your Eyes\") through season 7's midseason finale, \"Waterloo\". In another television show, the Netflix original program \"Orange Is the New Black\" season 2, episode 2 (\"Looks Blue, Tastes Red\"), \"Black Cindy bring[s] some Naderism to Lichtfield (a women's federal penitentiary) when talking about Philip Morris: 'Nah they ain't so bad. The people can decide for themselves if they wanna smoke. The real evil is them companies killing us without our consent. Monsanto. Rio Tinto. Big Pharma. BP. Halliburton. I've been reading there's some dark shit goin' down. Not that those motherfuckers are ever gonna hire us! The real criminals? They don't bother with small timers.' \".\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "14542540", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=14542540", "title": "Unreported employment", "text": "Unreported employment\n\nUnreported employment; working under the table, off the books, cash-in-hand, illicit work or (in UK English) moonlighting, is illegal employment that is not reported to the government. The employer or the employee often does so for tax evasion or avoiding or violating other laws. The working contract is made without social security costs, and does typically not provide health insurance, paid parental leave, paid vacation or pension funds. It is a part of what has been called the underground economy, shadow economy, black market or the non-observed economy. \n\nPayments are generally in cash, and the employer often does not check the employee's background or credentials, as is sometimes required by law or otherwise expected by the industry's client base, such as a license or professional certification.\n\nWhile the hiring of the employee may or may not be legal in itself, it is often done when the employer or the employee intentionally fails to obey one or more laws.\n\nIn developed nations, unreported employment evades withholding tax and is part of the informal sector. It is hidden from the state for tax, social security, or labor law purposes but is legal in all other aspects.\n\nCommon types of employment sectors of unreported jobs include the following:\n\nReasons one may work or pay a worker cash-in-hand include:\n\nUnreported employment can have harmful effects on government, employers, and employees.\n\nUnreported employment directly affects the government's ability to fund resources (government spending). It causes a tax gap by the reducing tax revenue of a government.\n\nA 2005 University of California, Los Angeles study showed that the economy in California was particularly weak by more than two million workers being paid without paying taxes. Indeed, it's estimated that over US $214.6 billion went unreported to the IRS last year alone from this. \n\nThose who are employed under the table, including illegal immigrants, may be denied rights that legally employed workers have, such as minimum wage, various benefits (particularly unemployment benefits), and fair treatment.\n\nUnder-the-table employees who lose their jobs may not be entitled to collect unemployment benefits. They have limited causes of action against their employers for mistreatment, on-the-job work accidents or lack of payment. Employers have limited cause of actions against employees who commit crimes such as embezzlement, theft, or abuse of employer.\n\nIf practices are widespread, legitimate businesses may be undercut by and have difficultly competing with those who employ staff illegally.\n\nGovernment revenue agencies look for lifestyles out of line with the income reported. They have tools that aid in assessing unreported taxes, which can result in large fines or jail time for the employer.\n\nMany new entrepreneurs fail to report their first part-time hired employees. The complexity of employment regulations and large amount of paperwork can be daunting to a new entrepreneur, especially when someone is needed for only a few hours a week. That early underground early employment may be a vital step in the growth of a healthy open economy.\n\nDay laborers fill immediate gaps during labor shortages in some segments of the construction and landscape industries. Background checks, identification, required paperwork, and government filings for only a day's work can be prohibitive. That encourages unreported employment of short-term laborers.\n\nA large amount of work for only a day or two is unreported. Although nanny laws make allowances for the homeowner, businesses are typically required to fill out and file several hours worth of paperwork even for an hour's worth of work.\n\nThe amounts are too small for tax collecting agencies to pursue and the paper work too arduous to file and so legitimate micro-employment among businesses is rare. However, it is an important resource for many small businesses.\n\nIn professional fields like architecture, or marketing, unreported work is typically the first step to starting a legitimate business.\n\nAgain, paperwork, compliance, and knowledge of labor laws are prohibitive for the small amount of work that is performed. Although illegal, side business generate relatively little revenue and so are rarely the target of tax enforcers. Eventually, professional employees have enough work to be able to leave their employer and become independent. Then, paperwork is usually filed and self-employment taxes are reported. The business then becomes a legitimate and beneficial part of the economy.\n\nThose who are unlikely to find employment through the reported economy, including those with past criminal records or current warrants as well as illegal immigrants can be reasonably productive and self-sufficient. That keeps them from engaging in less-desirable activities like theft and drug use.\n\nSelf-employment in cottage industries is often unreported at first. A home cook for example, may sell a few pies to friends and co-workers without filing necessary sales taxes or self-employment taxes. Although that is usually illegal, it may lead to a legitimate and beneficial business and is often how small businesses are started.\n\nIn some countries, the tax system attempts to set minimum thresholds on the amounts liable. However, there is still the burden of compliance with the bookkeeping requirements to prove that one is exempt.\n\nShort-term youth employment is often unreported but can be very beneficial. A teenager hired to aid in constructing a shed or barn, for example, learns valuable skills and responsibility. Most youth would not be employed for short-term projects if employment had to be reported. Government revenue collectors typically ignore enforcement of such of beneficial, unreported employment. Youth-run lemonade stands that have been shut down by police for example have received an enormous amount of bad press and public outcry.\n\nIt has been argued that because illegal immigrants are unable or unlikely to take advantage of unemployment, welfare, and retirement benefits, they are less likely to be unemployed and are more likely to contribute to a productive society. That view also argues that in states that rely primarily on sales tax as revenue instead of income tax, illegal immigrants may contribute more in government revenues than the government benefits they receive thereby creating a net positive revenue stream for the governing body.\n\nOften, both the employer and employee agree on paying in cash. Frequently, the employer is running an unreported cash-based business. These methods make detection by authorities to be time-consuming and difficult. Most small-scale operations take place without any real enforcement effort. Lawn-mowing is a good example of a cash-based business that is frequently unreported.\n\nIn the United States, authorities have focused enforcement resources on large-scale operations like illegal immigrants who are employed by large companies. Discovery and enforcement of small-scaled unreported employment is typically through a secondary indiscretion like fraud, tax irregularities, and unrelated or partially-related civil/criminal violations of the employer or employee.\n\nAlthough the federal government may arrest, prosecute, and imprison an individual for engaging in commerce without the state's approval, the high cost of such enforcement is usually prohibitive except for the most egregious cases.\n\nAccording to a \"The New York Times\" report in February 2013, the Obama administration had demonstrated a new strategy to curb the employment of illegal immigrants by focusing on companies that hire them in the first place. By concentrating on the businesses employing the large numbers of illegal workers, the number of illegal immigrants working in the US would drop dramatically. The U.S. government would be doing so in a less confrontational manner than they had in recent years.\n\nIn 2009, American Apparel was convicted of having workers that partook in illicit work. About 1,800 of American Apparel's employees were illegal immigrants who were not authorized to work in the United States. No federal agents stormed into the company's factory demanding the employees to be deported, but rather sent a written notice that stated that American Apparel faced civil fines and would have to fire all workers who were unauthorized to be in the United States.\n\n"}

At the end of the trust period, the shares would ordinarily be re-transferred to the beneficiary(ies), although in practice many voting trusts contain provisions for them to re-vested on the voting trusts with identical terms.\n\nVoting trusts were made popular in Delaware corporate law, but they have since been adopted widely by other states in the United States.

{"id": "3140750", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3140750", "title": "William Bernbach", "text": "William Bernbach\n\nWilliam \"Bill\" Bernbach (August 13, 1911 – October 2, 1982) was an American advertising creative director. He was one of the three founders in 1949 of the international advertising agency Doyle Dane Bernbach (DDB). He directed many of the firm's breakthrough ad campaigns and had a lasting impact on the creative team structures now commonly used by ad agencies.\n\nBill Bernbach was born to a Jewish family in The Bronx, New York City to Rebecca and Jacob Bernbach. He attended New York City public schools and in 1932 earned a B.A degree from New York University. He had majored in English but also studied business administration, philosophy and music, playing the piano .\n\nIn 1933, Bernbach took a job running the Schenley Distillers mailroom. This was during the Depression and a family connection got him the job. He pro-actively wrote an ad for Schenley's American Cream Whiskey, which he got into the right hands and the ad ran. He was promoted to the advertising department.\n\nHe left Schenley in 1939 to ghostwrite for Grover Whalen, the head of the 1939 World's Fair and the following year he entered the advertising industry at the William Weintraub agency. He saw two years' active service in World War II and thereafter had a role at Coty, followed by a position at Grey Advertising. He commenced there as a Copywriter but was promoted to Creative Director by 1947.\n\nHowever, soon Bernbach became frustrated with the sameness he saw in all advertising. In a plea to agency management he penned a letter expressing that concern. One paragraph in particular revealed Bernbach's desire to change advertising creativity:\n\nIn 1949, with James Edwin Doyle, whom he had met at Grey, and Maxwell Dane, who was already running a tiny agency, Bernbach founded their eponymous ad agency in Manhattan. His philosophy towards creative advertising was that the creative execution (the way the message is conveyed) is just as important as the message content (what is being said). \n\nFrom its founding Bernbach played an integral role in the writing of advertising, distancing himself from the administrative and promotional aspects of the business which were left to Dane. He served as the creative engine behind the agency helping billings to increase from approximately US$1 million to more than US$40 million by the time he retired.\n\nDDB grew to become the 11th largest advertising agency in America by 1976, when Bernbach stepped aside as Chief Executive Officer to become chairman of the executive committee.\n\nHis most notable campaign was for Volkswagen, which included ads such as \"Think Small\" and \"Lemon\". Other notable campaigns created by Bernbach's team are:\n\nBernbach's campaign for Avis Rent-a-Car effectively pioneered \"underdog advertising\" and was an instant hit with the market. It debuted in 1962, when Avis was losing market share to close rival, Hertz and helped the company's financial position turn around from a loss to a profit in a single year. The campaign tagline remained unchanged for 50 years, and is one of advertising's most enduring campaigns. \n\nBernbach was noted for his devotion to creativity and offbeat themes, a legacy that has credited him as a major force behind the \"Creative Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s\". His work often was characterized by simplicity. He also is credited with being the first to combine copywriters and art directors into two-person teams. They commonly had been in separate departments, a model that still exists in advertising agencies today.\n\nBernbach won many awards and honors for his work within the advertising industry during his career. He was inducted into the Copywriters Hall of Fame in 1964, received the Man of the Year of Advertising Award in 1964 and 1965, and The Pulse Inc., Man of the Year Award in 1966. He was also named \"Top Advertising Agency Executive\" in 1969 and received the American Academy of Achievement Award in 1976 and was inducted into the American Advertising Federation Hall of Fame in the same year. He designed the Advertising Hall of Fame \"Golden Ladder\" trophy.\n\nThe AMC program, \"Mad Men\", which centers on the fictional ad agency of \"Sterling Cooper\" in the early 1960s, makes many references to Bernbach; Bernbach's innovative techniques challenge Sterling Cooper's more orthodox style, and DDB often is mentioned as a competitor in the second season.\n\nAt the Schenley Distillers mailroom in the 1930s, one of Bernbach's assistants was Evelyn Carbone, a college student at Hunter College, who addressed labels on outgoing mail.\n\nWhile Bernbach worked his way into the advertising department, Evelyn became a receptionist. They fell in love and were married in 1938 by a justice of the peace. Bernbach's family was against the marriage on religious grounds, but they lived happily and had two sons: John L. and Paul.\n\nAfter Bill's death, Evelyn and Bob Levenson, the DDB creative leader, published \"Bill Bernbach's Book: A History of Advertising that Changed the History of Advertising\".\n\n\n\n\n"}
