It is an example of pseudoscience or pseudoarchaeology that employs contrived calculations involving many free parameters to achieve an impressive-looking result.\n\nThe word \"archaeocryptography\" is derived from \"archaeology\", which is the study of human activity in the past, and \"cryptography\", which is the study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties.\n\nArchaeocryptologists try to find underlying correlations in respect that which is being studied or decoded. Some factors taken into consideration while deciphering an object, structure or megalithic monument can include the features such as faces, stairs, sides, and terraces. The geolocation or mathematical operations are performed on latitude and longitude coordinates as well as astronomical alignments, such as are found with archaeoastronomy. The incorporation of grids, the use of numerical ordering, mathematical constants, Biblical gematria, and any other re-occurring number that might stand out from the decoding process are determining factors.\n\nArchaeocryptologists then can use different mathematical formulas to find correlations within that which is being studied or between other monuments or structures that share any underlying factors. Popular examples are the Orion correlation theory between the Giza pyramid complex and the three middle stars of the constellation Orion, and also theories about the region of Cydonia on Mars.\n\nThe coining of the word \"archaeocryptography\" is often attributed to Carl P. Munck, who after retiring from the United States military in the late 1970s began studying cartographic material, among other topics, trying to search for better answers as to why certain megalithic monument exist. This led him to a formula he believes architects used to place and design various megalithic monuments. Munck's theory claims that calculations using selected numbers or dimensions found in megalithic monuments or Egyptian pyramids yield the latitude or longitude of the site. However, in Munck's findings, the prime meridian does not run through Greenwich, but through the Great Pyramid in Giza. His theory is known simply as \"The Code\" and asserts that an ancient Jewish numerological system known as gematria is used in the manipulation of numbers to other key locations, mathematical components and positions of sights in the geometry of their construction.\n\nThe theory later become popularized and among other practitioners and researchers in pseudo-scientific fields, such as Michael Lawrence Morton, Richard C. Hoagland, Bruce Cathie, and Hugh Harleston Jr. They adapted archaeocryptography to their own studies, developing different theories and books based on the topic.\n\nThe marginal, or even fictional, status of archaeocryptography was suggested in Zachary Mason's novel \"The Lost Books of the Odyssey\", which purports to be a collection of lost works which the author describes as being as old as the Odyssey and which he claims to have decoded from a manuscript he had uncovered. In the author's biography at the conclusion of the book he describes himself as \"the John Shade Professor of Archaeocryptography and Paleomathematics at Magdalen College, Oxford\". The \"lost books\" were actually written by Mason and, as reviewers have noted, Mason is a novelist and computer scientist who lives in California, John Shade is a fictional poet in Vladimir Nabokov's \"Pale Fire\", and no such professorship exists.\n\n"}

Creep premiered on March 8, 2014, at South by Southwest, and was released on video on demand on June 23, 2015, by The Orchard prior to an international release via Netflix on July 14, 2015.\n\nThe film follows Aaron (portrayed by Brice), a videographer who answers an ad, created by Josef (portrayed by Duplass). As they get closer together, he discovers that his client is not who he was expecting.\n\nAaron (Patrick Brice) is a videographer who decides to work for Josef (Mark Duplass) after answering his ad. All Aaron has to do is record Josef throughout the day. Aaron drives up to a secluded home up a steep driveway. After making him wait for quite a while, upon arrival, Josef insists on hugging Aaron, and insinuates there will be \"more of that to come.\" Josef explains that the home is his family vacation home, and that he beat cancer two years earlier but now has a large brain tumor. His wife, Angela, is pregnant, and Aaron will be recording a series of videos for Josef's unborn son, as he is dying and will never be able to see him grow up. Josef tells Aaron that he and his wife are calling the baby \"Buddy.\" Josef's first request for Aaron is to record him taking a bath with Buddy. He simulates holding a baby, then pretends to drown to scare Aaron. \n\nLater, Josef asks Aaron to go hiking with him. While getting a jacket, Aaron is startled by a wolf mask in the closet; Josef tells him that his father used to wear the mask, pretending to be a friendly wolf named Peachfuzz. While hiking, Josef claims to know of a secret place with \"healing waters\" and leads Aaron to a hidden waterfall. He writes \"J+A\" on a large stone with a rock, drawing a heart around the initials. Throughout their time together, Josef repeatedly scares Aaron, excusing his behavior by claiming he has a \"weird sense of humor.\"\n\nAt a restaurant after their hiking trip, Aaron becomes suspicious that Josef has never been to this restaurant, or even the area. Josef asks Aaron if he has ever been ashamed of anything. Aaron tells him that as a child, he would often pee himself to a point where he wore a monitor to alert him when it became wet. Josef then admits to Aaron that while Aaron was waiting for Josef's arrival, he took photos of him standing by the front door. Josef says it was only because he wanted to get to know Aaron before meeting him and apologizes profusely. \n\nAs Aaron gets ready to leave that night, Josef asks him to stay for a drink. Aaron is already suspicious of Josef's behavior and insist on leaving, but reluctantly agrees to join him. Josef asks Aaron to turn off the camera, claiming that what he was going to say was not appropriate for Buddy. Aaron shuts off the video but leaves the sound on. Josef tells him he lied about Peachfuzz, and he wore the wolf mask in order to rape his wife to confirm his suspicions about her animal pornography habit. An unsettled Aaron then attempts to leave, but is unable to find his keys. Josef tells Aaron that he should wait to leave till the morning, that it will be easier to find the keys and to sleep off the alcohol. Aaron agrees. He then drugs Josef's whiskey with Benadryl, and lays him to sleep. Josef begins to talk in his sleep, saying very disturbing things to Aaron and even begins to touch himself. Aaron attempts to search Josef for his keys when Josef's phone begins to ring. Aaron answers the phone to Josef's \"wife,\" who tells Aaron that she is really his sister, and that her brother has problems. She insist that he leaves the house, with or without his keys. The call drops, and Aaron returns to find Josef gone. Aaron searches the home until Josef scares him again and tells him that he doesn't want to die. Aaron tells Josef that he spoke to his sister, and that he wants to help Josef. Josef becomes angry and runs back into the home. Aaron attempts to leave, but finds Josef blocking the front door with the Peachfuzz mask on. Aaron asks Josef to please let him leave, in which Josef shakes his head 'no' and begins to growl and grope the door. Aaron charges at him, and the camera shuts off.\n\nWhen the video resumes, Aaron reveals that he escaped and made it home, but soon received a DVD in the mail from Josef. It depicts Josef dragging filled trash bags up a hill, and burying them. Aaron thinks it is meant as a threat but does not call the police.\n\nAaron admits that he has been having terrible nightmares about Josef wearing a wolf mask and Aaron wearing a baby mask, dancing in the waterfall they previously visited. Aaron then receives a large box with a knife and a stuffed wolf in it, as well as another DVD with a video of Josef apologizing and saying that he really cares about Aaron. Josef now repeatedly calls Aaron \"Buddy\" in the videos. Per Josef's instructions, Aaron rips open the stuffed wolf to find a locket with Josef's and Aaron's pictures in it. Upset, Aaron throws everything away. \n\nAaron decides to go to the police, which are no help due to the fact that he does not know anything about Josef, including his full name. That night, Aaron hears odd noises in his home which prompts him to investigate. As Aaron searches his home, Josef can be seen looking through the front door. Josef runs away as Aaron approaches. Aaron does not see Josef, and goes to the alleyway only to find his trash knocked over. Later that night as Aaron sleeps, Josef turns on the camera and films Aaron, even cutting off a piece of Aaron's hair. Aaron wakes up to find that the screen in his window ripped, and another DVD labeled \"My Last Video\" next to his bed. Josef, in the video, apologizes again, revealing that he found the locket in Aaron's trash, which hurt him greatly. He claims this led to the realization that he needs help, as he is sad and needs a friend. He asks Aaron to come to a public lake by his house to talk so they could finally have \"closure.\" His pleas move Aaron enough to compel him to go to the lake. Aaron leaves the camera rolling from his car and has 911 on speed dial just in case. Upon arrival Aaron does not find Josef, and sits on a bench overlooking the lake to wait for him. Josef is seen approaching Aaron from behind and stands there for a few moments, before putting on the Peachfuzz mask. He then sneaks closer to Aaron and reveals an axe in his hand. Still unbeknownst to Aaron, Josef stands behind Aaron with the axe over him, before he swings it into Aaron's skull, killing him instantly.\n\nJosef is then shown filming himself watching the murder tape, which he has already done several times before. He expresses admiration and even puzzlement at Aaron's naivety and kindness, and claims he loves him and considers him to be his favorite \"of them all.\" \n\nHe puts a DVD labeled \"Aaron <3\" in a cabinet full of videos and DVDs with different people's names on them, as he identifies himself as Bill over the phone while speaking to yet another person about hiring them to film him.\n\n\nDuplass said that the film's story \"was inspired by character-driven dramas that are, at their heart, two-handers: \"My Dinner with Andre\", \"Misery\", and \"Fatal Attraction\"\" as well as \"[his] myriad of strange Craigslist experiences over the years.\" Brice and Duplass originally began working on \"Creep\" under the working title \"Peachfuzz\", but chose to rename the film as the title's relevance came later in the movie's plot and they did not want viewers to \"spend the first half hour trying to figure out why the movie is called Peachfuzz and [not] pay attention to the very intricate details\". The two built the movie from a series of conversations they had with one another and decided to refine \"Creep\" while they were filming, which enabled them to film and screen portions of the film to see what would or wouldn't work on camera. As a result, the film had multiple alternate end scenarios and Duplass stated that there were \"10 to 12 permutations of each scene\".\n\nOf the creative process for his character, Josef, Duplass explained \"We were interested in the psychological profile of this very, very strange person. We were very interested in how you meet people and don‚Äôt quite understand what‚Äôs up, but you start to get signs. For us that was intense eye contact, lack of personal space, oversharing, maybe a little bit too much love here and there. But, for me, there‚Äôs something wrong with both of these guys. Deeply. This concept of, 'who is the creep in this scenario?'\"\n\n\"Creep\" received a world premiere at the South by Southwest Film Festival on March 8, 2014 and film rights were purchased by RADiUS-TWC shortly thereafter. Plans for an October 2014, video on demand release fell through, when RADiUS didn't release the film. In June 2015, The Orchard and Sony Pictures Home Entertainment (Orchard's parent company) acquired distribution rights to the film. The film was released on June 23, 2015, on video on demand, prior to a global release on Netflix on July 14, 2015.\n\n\"Creep\" was released on DVD on April 5, 2016 from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.\n\n\"Creep\" received positive reviews. The film has a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 24 reviews and with an average rating of 7.2/10, the critical consensus stating, \"A smart, oddball take on found-footage horror, \"Creep\" is clever and well-acted enough to keep viewers on the edges of their seats\". On Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 74 out of 100, based on 6 reviews. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" and \"Indiewire\" both gave the film positive reviews, and \"Indiewire\" noted that although the film had its flaws, they mostly worked in \"Creep's\" favor. \"Variety\" remarked that \"Creep\" \"could have been more effective if Duplass‚Äô performance were a shade more ambiguous, and the audience had a chance to at least fleetingly believe Josef might be telling the truth\" but that \"Despite the blatancy of his character‚Äôs ulterior motives, Duplass scores a considerable impact by making the most of the aforementioned plot twists.\" In contrast, \"Shock Till You Drop\" panned the movie overall, stating that \"\"Creep\" might work for those don't regularly digest horror films, but for the hardened fan, this is a film that spins its wheels all too often and feels like an exercise in self-indulgence.\"\n\nShortly after \"Creep's\" premiere at South by Southwest, Duplass announced that he intended to film a sequel and after the film distribution rights were purchased by RADiUS-TWC, he further announced that he was planning on creating a trilogy. In August 2014, Duplass further stated that he and Brice planned on filming the second \"Creep\" film at the end of the year, that the film's cast would be announced during that time, and that the trilogy would be completed in 2015. However, in February 2015, Duplass commented that neither he nor Brice had been able to start filming on \"Creep 2\" due to scheduling issues, as the careers of both men had greatly expanded since \"Creep\" release, but that the both of them were still actively developing the project. In May 2016, Duplass & Brice announced discussions had begun on the sequel. In August 2016, Duplass revealed that he had begun trying on costumes for the film.\n\nIn September 2016, it was announced production had begun on the film, with Duplass returning, and Desiree Akhavan joining the cast, with Brice returning as the director.\n\n\n"}

The system optimizes the use of video and television in the context of the environmental movement by incorporating the cybernetic ideas of Gregory Bateson and the semiotics of Charles Sanders Peirce. The intent of the system is to generate human behaviors that comply with the self-correcting mechanisms of the\nEarth. Earthscore has been studied and utilized by university students and academics worldwide since 1992.\n\nEarthscore was developed and created by The New School professor and artist Paul Ryan, and originally published by NASA in 1990.\n\nIn its most complete and succinct iteration, Earthscore is a notational system with five components. These components are:\n\nUsing the trikonic categories of firstness, secondness, and thirdness developed by American philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce, Earthscore splits knowledge into three modes of being: firstness (positive quality), secondness (actual fact), and thirdness (laws that will govern facts in the future), and defines these categories as \"a theory of everything\".\n\nFirstness is positive quality in the realm of spontaneity, freshness, possibility, and freedom. Earthscore defines firstness as being \"as is\", without regard for any other. Examples include: the taste of banana, warmth, redness, and feeling gloomy.\n\nSecondness is a two-sided consciousness of effort and resistance engendered by being up against brute facts. Earthscore defines secondness as the \"facticity\", or \"thisness\", of something, as it exists, here and now, without rhyme or reason. Examples include: pushing against an unlocked door and meeting silent, unseen resistance.\n\nThirdness mediates between secondness and firstness, between fact and possibility. \"Earthscore\" defines thirdness as the realm of habit and laws that will govern facts in the future, and posits that a knowledge of thirdness can allow predictions of how certain future events will turn out. It is an 'if...then' sort of knowledge. Thirdness consists in the reality that future facts of secondness will conform to general laws.\n\nThe relational circuit is a self-penetrating, tubular continuum with six unambiguous positions which attempts to supply a topological continuum to the trikonic categories. The circuit organizes differences in terms of firstness, secondness, and thirdness, and three \"in-between\" positions that connect them within the continuum. The relational circuit is to the Earthscore System what the staff and bars are to classical music notation, and is the basis of the third component, threeing.\n\nThreeing is a practice in which three people take turns playing three different roles; initiator, respondent and mediator, in an attempt to solve relational confusion. The roles correspond to the categories of firstness, secondness, and thirdness. Through role playing, the three individuals interact with each other spontaneously and recursively, following the relational circuit.\n\nThreeing is further broken down into ten different subsections:\n\n\nEarthscore utilizes the Firstness of Thirdness as a means of creativity, in an attempt to imagine an ecologically sustainable life before living it. By incorporating pure firstness as the realm of spontaneity, Earthscore uses the disciplines of Zen, yoga, and T'ai chi to cultivate the human capacity to be comfortable in pure firstness and yield new insights and visions.\n\nEarthscore approaches knowledge as a process of generating signs, and incorporates the semiotic system of Charles Sanders Peirce consistent with the trikonic categories: A sign (firstness) representing an object (secondness) for an interpretant (thirdness). Earthscore exfoliates the threefold division into a sixty-six-fold classification of signs that is inclusive of everything in nature, in order to systematize both interdisciplinary and multimedia representations of ecosystems.\n\n\n"}

The page ran for about a year until it was closed down after the arrest of its creator for blasphemy on . The case, which started as a Facebook flame, reached the Greek Parliament twice and created a strong local as well as international political impact.\n\nThe main satire of the page revolved around Elder Paisios (d. 1994), a monk from Holy Mountain, famous for his spiritual teachings.

High-ranking priests as well as believers have proposed that the Elder should be recognised as a Saint by the Orthodox Church. The page criticised, among others, the exploitation of Paisios by the press and by Orthodox websites that propagate the alleged prophecies and teachings of the charismatic Elder (according to his followers he had predicted the fall of the Soviet Union and the recent Greek crisis).\n\nThe \"Elder Pastitsios\" page satirised and criticised (with no reported profanity according to the media), various religious aspects in Greece such as infant baptism, religious education in schools and the lack of separation between church and state; these were presented through the eyes of the Pastafarian satirical pseudo-religion \"Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster\", which has been used to lampoon the teaching of creationism in schools.\n\nThe page created a hoax about a posthumous miracle by Elder Paisios which was submitted to various Orthodox, conservative and far-right blogs in July. The story was based on several existing accounts that were already circulating online and involved the miraculous recovery of a teenager who supposedly woke from a coma after his mother placed a talisman with dirt from Elder Paisios‚Äô grave under his pillow.\n\nThe story reached 93,800 Google search results and was reproduced both online and in print, and even became a cover story on the far-right newspaper \"Eleftheri Ora\". The 27-year-old page creator would later state that he did this to expose the gullibility of the faithful, and also to show the poor fact-checking done among the religious and conservative blogosphere.\n\nFour days before the page creator's arrest, MP Christos Pappas from the far-right Golden Dawn party had brought the page to the attention of the Minister of Justice by raising a question to the Greek Parliament on September 17. The police claimed they had already concluded their investigation two days before the question was raised in parliament due to thousands of complaints by Orthodox believers worldwide.\n\nOn 21 September, the 27-year-old man was arrested in Greece on charges of malicious blasphemy and offense of religion for the creation of a satirical Facebook page called \"Elder Pastitsios\". Blasphemy in Greece carries a fine of up to 3,000 ‚Ç¨, and up to 2 years imprisonment.\n\nThe news of the arrest created a worldwide interest in the case with the Twitter hashtag #FreeGeronPastitsios becoming a global trending topic and a relevant petition by the Humanist Union of Greece has received over 10,000 signatures so far on Change.org.\n\nIn a web television interview after his arrest, the page owner said that the evidence that led the e-crimes bureau of the Greek police to him were all provided by Facebook. Pan-Euro communications manager of Facebook, Iain Mackenzie wrote that Facebook disclosed basic subscriber information in response to a Greek court order without knowing what type of charges the user was subject to. According to article 19 of the Greek Constitution, limiting of confidentiality of communications is allowed only in cases of \"particularly serious crimes.\" The Greek criminal code translates \"particularly serious crimes\" as felonies while \"malicious blasphemy and offense of religion\" is considered a misdemeanor.\n\nFollowing the publication of the arrest, Greece's ruling coalition junior partner Democratic Left and the Greek Communist Party strongly denounced the arrest while leftist primary opposition party SYRIZA raised a second question to the parliament, this time concerning the legality of the arrest and the freedom of expression. The parliamentary spokesman of SYRIZA and MP Dimitrios Papadimoulis stated that he would appear as a defense witness in the trial of the arrestee and even the metropolitan bishop of Thessaloniki, Anthimos said on a radio show that he did \"not agree with the prosecution, better to leave him alone. No one can usurp the faith\". Supporters of the arrestee held a small protest in front of the Greek Parliament on September 28 and on the same night another one in the centre of Athens parodying an Orthodox litany.\n\nThe page creator mentioned that he plans on focusing his future activism on the repeal of Greece's blasphemy laws.\n\nOn January 16, 2014, the creator of the original \"Elder Pastitsios\" website was found guilty of \"repeatedly insulting religion\" and was sentenced to ten months in jail, suspended while the prosecutor had recommended a smaller sentence. In the 2017 retrial, however, the court acquitted Loizos.\n\nThe idea of creating fictional characters based on Paisios quickly became a brief internet meme featured in mainstream media and even in T-shirts, occasionally as a reaction to the arrest, and support to the page creator. Such characters include \"Elder Parisios\" with monk's head substituted by the Eiffel Tower, \"Elder Papisios\" from the Greek word for duck (, \"pap√≠\") and the face of Daffy Duck, and many others.\n\n"}

It was one of a series of installations Antenna Theater's director, Chris Hardman, describes as \"walkmanology\", in which audience members are guided through a set wearing headphone devices. For Euphorium, the audience members were given specially-designed helmets that included not only stereo speakers, but also a periscope-like device by which they would view a diorama created on a room's ceiling as they walked slowly through the performance. Infrared triggers would initiate various mp3-encoded audio segments as they passed. The result was alternately described as an immersive multimedia performance, and \"gothic theater\".\n\nHardman had founded a successful company, Antenna Audio, by applying the innovation to self-guided museum tours, beginning with Alcatraz Island. The production also made use of a 19th-century optical technique known as \"Pepper's Ghost\", and various puppetry techniques, which Hardman learned in the 1970s as a member of Bread and Puppet Theater at Coney Island.\n\nThe initial production ran from 2000 to 2001 in an old army building in the Presidio of San Francisco that also included a mock opium den. In 2002-2003 Antenna partnered with Soho Theatre Company for a run in the cave-like basement of The Roundhouse in Camden Town, London.\n\nCritical response was mixed, with some complaining that the show's technology and effects were unrefined. The production was also criticized as being confusing, and showing a misunderstanding of the meaning of Coleridge's poem.\n"}

{"id": "143366", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=143366", "title": "Fountain of Youth", "text": "Fountain of Youth\n\nThe Fountain of Youth is a spring that supposedly restores the youth of anyone who drinks or bathes in its waters. Tales of such a fountain have been recounted across the world for thousands of years, appearing in writings by Herodotus (5th century BC), the Alexander romance (3rd century AD), and the stories of Prester John (early Crusades, 11th/12th centuries AD). Stories of similar waters were also evidently prominent among the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean during the Age of Exploration (early 16th century), who spoke of the restorative powers of the water in the mythical land of Bimini.\n\nThe legend became particularly prominent in the 16th century, when it was attached to the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le√≥n, first Governor of Puerto Rico. According to an apocryphal combination of New World and Eurasian elements, Ponce de Le√≥n was searching for the Fountain of Youth when he traveled to what is now Florida in 1513. The legend says that Ponce de Le√≥n was told by Native Americans that the Fountain of Youth was in Bimini and it could restore youth to anyone.\n\nHerodotus mentions a fountain containing a special kind of water in the land of the Macrobians, which gives the Macrobians their exceptional longevity.\n\nA story of the \"Water of Life\" appears in the Eastern versions of the Alexander romance, which describes Alexander the Great and his servant crossing the Land of Darkness to find the restorative spring. The servant in that story is in turn derived from Middle Eastern legends of Al-Khidr, a sage who appears also in the Qur'an. Arabic and Aljamiado versions of the \"Alexander Romance\" were very popular in Spain during and after the period of Moorish rule, and would have been known to the explorers who journeyed to America. These earlier accounts inspired the popular medieval fantasy \"The Travels of Sir John Mandeville\", which also mentions the Fountain of Youth as located at the foot of a mountain outside Polombe (modern Kollam) in India. Due to the influence of these tales, the Fountain of Youth legend was popular in courtly Gothic art, appearing for example on the ivory Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264) and several ivory mirror-cases, and remained popular through the European Age of Exploration.\nEuropean iconography is fairly consistent, as the Cranach painting and mirror-case from 200 years earlier demonstrate: old people, often carried, enter at left, strip, and enter a pool that is as large as space allows. The people in the pool are youthful and naked, and after a while they leave it, and are shown fashionably dressed enjoying a courtly party, sometimes including a meal.\n\nThere are countless indirect sources for the tale as well. Eternal youth is a gift frequently sought in myth and legend, and stories of things such as the philosopher's stone, universal panaceas, and the elixir of life are common throughout Eurasia and elsewhere. An additional hint may have been taken from the account of the Pool of Bethesda in the Gospel of John, in which Jesus heals a man at the pool in Jerusalem.\n\nAccording to legend, the Spanish heard of Bimini from the Arawaks in Hispaniola, Cuba, and Puerto Rico. The Caribbean islanders described a mythical land of \"Beimeni\" or \"Beniny\" (whence Bimini), a land of wealth and prosperity, which became conflated with the fountain legend. By the time of Ponce de Leon, the land was thought to be located northwest towards the Bahamas (called \"la Vieja\" during the Ponce expedition). The natives were probably referring to the area occupied by the Maya. This land also became confused with the Boinca or Boyuca mentioned by Juan de Solis, although Solis's navigational data placed it in the Gulf of Honduras. It was this Boinca that originally held a legendary fountain of youth, rather than Bimini itself. Sequene, an Arawak chief from Cuba, purportedly was unable to resist the lure of Bimini and its restorative fountain. He gathered a troupe of adventurers and sailed north, never to return.\n\nFound within the salt water mangrove swamp that covers of the shoreline of North Bimini is \"The Healing Hole\", a pool that lies at the end of a network of winding underground tunnels. During outgoing tides, these channels pump cool, mineral-laden fresh water into the pool. Because this well was carved out of the limestone rock by ground water thousands of years ago it is especially high in calcium and magnesium. Magnesium, which has been shown to improve longevity and reproductive health, is present in large quantities in the sea water. While it is not known whether any legend about healing waters was widespread among the indigenous peoples of the Caribbean, the Italian-born chronicler Peter Martyr attached such a story drawn from ancient and medieval European sources to his account of the 1514 voyage of Juan Diaz de Solis in a letter to the pope in 1516, though he did not believe the stories and was dismayed that so many others did. \n\nIn the 16th century the story of the Fountain of Youth became attached to the biography of the conquistador Juan Ponce de Le√≥n. As attested by his royal charter, Ponce de Le√≥n was charged with discovering the land of \"Beniny\". Although the indigenous peoples were probably describing the land of the Maya in Yucat√°n, the nameand legends about Boinca's fountain of youthbecame associated with the Bahamas instead. However, Ponce de Le√≥n did not mention the fountain in any of his writings throughout the course of his expedition.\n\nThe connection was made in Gonzalo Fern√°ndez de Oviedo's \"Historia general y natural de las Indias\" of 1535, in which he wrote that Ponce de Le√≥n was looking for the waters of Bimini to regain youthfulness. Some researchers have suggested that Oviedo's account may have been politically inspired to generate favor in the courts. A similar account appears in Francisco L√≥pez de G√≥mara's \"Historia general de las Indias\" of 1551. In the \"Memoir\" of Hernando d'Escalante Fontaneda in 1575, the author places the restorative waters in Florida and mentions de Le√≥n looking for them there; his account influenced Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas' unreliable history of the Spanish in the New World. Fontaneda had spent seventeen years as an Indian captive after being shipwrecked in Florida as a boy. In his \"Memoir\" he tells of the curative waters of a lost river he calls \"Jordan\" and refers to de Le√≥n looking for it. However, Fontaneda makes it clear he is skeptical about these stories he includes, and says he doubts de Le√≥n was actually looking for the fabled stream when he came to Florida.\n\nHerrera makes that connection definite in the romanticized version of Fontaneda's story included in his \"Historia general de los hechos de los Castellanos en las islas y tierra firme del Mar Oceano\". Herrera states that local caciques paid regular visits to the fountain. A frail old man could become so completely restored that he could resume \"all manly exercises ‚Ä¶ take a new wife and beget more children.\" Herrera adds that the Spaniards had unsuccessfully searched every \"river, brook, lagoon or pool\" along the Florida coast for the legendary fountain.\n\nThe city of St. Augustine, Florida, is home to the Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park, a tribute to the spot where Ponce de Le√≥n was supposed to have landed according to promotional literature, although there is no historical or archaeological evidence to support the claim. There were several instances of the property being used as an attraction as early as the 1860s; the tourist attraction in its present form was created by Luella Day McConnell in 1904. Having abandoned her practice as a physician in Chicago and gone to the Yukon during the Klondike gold rush of the 1890s, she purchased the Park property in 1904 from Henry H. Williams, a British horticulturalist, with cash and diamonds, for which she became known in St. Augustine as \"Diamond Lil\". Around the year 1909 she began advertising the attraction, charging admission, and selling post cards and water from a well dug in 1875 for Williams by Philip Gomez and Philip Capo. McConnell later claimed to have \"discovered\" on the grounds a large cross made of coquina rock, asserting it was placed there by Ponce de Le√≥n himself. She continued to fabricate stories to amuse and appall the city's residents and tourists until her death in a car accident in 1927. \n\nWalter B. Fraser, a transplant from Georgia who managed McConnell's attraction, then bought the property and made it one of the state's most successful tourist attractions. The first archaeological digs at the Fountain of Youth were performed in 1934 by the Smithsonian Institution. These digs produced a large number of Christianized Timucua burials. These burials eventually pointed to the Park as the location of the first Christian mission in the United States. Called the Mission Nombre de Dios, this mission was begun by Franciscan friars in 1587. Succeeding decades have seen the unearthing of items which positively identify the Park as the location of Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s's 1565 settlement of St. Augustine, the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in North America. The park currently exhibits native and colonial artifacts to celebrate St. Augustine's Timucua and Spanish heritage.\n\n"}
{"id": "2392067", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2392067", "title": "Frame semantics (linguistics)", "text": "Frame semantics (linguistics)\n\nFrame semantics is a theory of linguistic meaning developed by Charles J. Fillmore that extends his earlier case grammar. It relates linguistic semantics to encyclopedic knowledge.\nThe basic idea is that one cannot understand the meaning of a single word without access to all the essential knowledge that relates to that word. For example, one would not be able to understand the word \"sell\" without knowing anything about the situation of commercial transfer, which also involves, among other things, a seller, a buyer, goods, money, the relation between the money and the goods, the relations between the seller and the goods and the money, the relation between the buyer and the goods and the money and so on.\n\nThus, a word activates, or evokes, a frame of semantic knowledge relating to the specific concept to which it refers (or highlights, in frame semantic terminology).\n\nA semantic frame is a collection of facts that specify \"characteristic features, attributes, and functions of a denotatum, and its characteristic interactions with things necessarily or typically associated with it.\" \nA semantic frame can also be defined as a coherent structure of related concepts that are related such that without knowledge of all of them, one does not have complete knowledge of any one; they are in that sense types of gestalt. Frames are based on recurring experiences. So the commercial transaction frame is based on recurring experiences of commercial transactions.\n\nWords not only highlight individual concepts, but also specify a certain perspective from which the frame is viewed. For example \"sell\" views the situation from the perspective of the seller and \"buy\" from the perspective of the buyer. This, according to Fillmore, explains the observed asymmetries in many lexical relations.\n\nWhile originally only being applied to lexemes, frame semantics has now been expanded to grammatical constructions and other larger and more complex linguistic units and has more or less been integrated into construction grammar as the main semantic principle. Semantic frames are also becoming used in information modeling, for example in Gellish, especially in the form of 'definition models' and 'knowledge models'.\n\nFrame semantics has much in common with the semantic principle of profiling from Ronald W. Langacker's Cognitive Grammar.\n\n\n"}

Kuipers had collected around 850 online jokes about 9/11, Osama Bin Laden, and the Afghanistan war by 2005. A notable early public attempt at 9/11 humor was done by Gilbert Gottfried just a few weeks after the attacks. During a comedy roast for Hugh Hefner at the Friars Club his 9/11 gag did not go over well with the crowd. One audience member at the club yelled out \"Too soon!\", which has since become a common response to jokes told in the immediate wake of tragedies. Gottfried then improvised and performed \"The Aristocrats\" routine, which released a great deal of tension and got rousing applause from the crowd.\n\nIn contrast to these early jokes about 9/11, late-night comedy shows and humorous publications did not appear for several weeks following the attacks. \"The Onion\", a satirical newspaper, cancelled the issue that had been scheduled to be released on September 11, 2001, and then returned to print with a special edition on September 26, 2001, which was devoted to the attacks. When the issue was released, the newspaper staff felt trepidation over making humor of such a tragic event. \"Everyone thought this would be our last issue in print,\" according to one staff writer. Despite this expectation, \"The Onion\" staff was quickly inundated with comments from readers, the vast majority of which were positive. However, they self-censored the article titled \"America Stronger Than Ever, Say Quadragon Officials.\"\n\nOne of the first 9/11 jokes made by a major American comedian in the UK was one told by Joan Rivers in London in 2002. The joke concerned the widows of fire fighters killed in the attacks, who Rivers said would be disappointed if their husbands had been found alive as they would be forced to return money they had received in compensation for their late spouses. The joke received condemnation from Harold Schaitberger, General President of the International Association of Fire Fighters.\n\n\"The Zero\" (2006) by Jess Walter is a post-911 satirical novel which features a New York City cop who shoots himself in the head and forgets it minutes later; his brain damage accounts for gaps in the story. The postmodern novel \"United States of Banana\" (2011) by Latin American author Giannina Braschi treats the entropic scenes of disaster on September 11 with black humor; the work describes New York City without the Twin Towers as a mouth unwilling to laugh because it is missing its two front teeth.\n\nIn 2016, comedian Billy Domineau uploaded a spec script to the Internet that he had written for \"Seinfeld\", which had aired its last episode in 1998, set in New York during the days after the attacks. He said later that it had started when he suggested \"a 9/11 episode of \"Seinfeld\"\" to a student as an example of \"an exercise in bad taste\" for a class. In his episode, the show's four main characters follow plotlines typical of them, all related to the attacks: Jerry becomes convinced that dust from the fallen towers is contaminating his food; Elaine, initially relieved that she won't have to break up with a boyfriend who worked at the Twin Towers, finds herself engaged to him when he unexpectedly survives; George basks in the glory after he is mistaken for a hero who rescued people, and Kramer attempts to recover the high-quality box cutter he loaned to Mohammed Atta. Popular minor characters, such as George's parents and Newman, also make appearances. \"[It] is indeed in bad taste, but it perfectly captures the self-obsessed way these characters would handle such a crisis,\" wrote \"The Guardian\".\n\nIn the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Back to the Pilot\", broadcast in November 2011, Brian and Stewie take a trip back in time during which Brian tips off his past self about 9/11 so that the old him can play hero and stop the terrorist attacks. This causes George W. Bush not to be re-elected, meaning a Second Civil War starts that leads to nuclear attacks on the Eastern Seaboard. A \"Time\" critic wrote of the episode, \"It sounds custom-made for a 'too soon' label, and it probably is. But avid \"Family Guy\" viewers live for \"too soon\" moments, no matter how sensitive the material.\" Other news organizations, including Aly Semigran of \"Entertainment Weekly\", also thought the show had gone too far with the reference. \"Deadline\" also commented that it \"squeaked past the Fox standards and practices department but is sure to raise as many eyebrows.\"\n\nHowever, perhaps reflecting how the acceptability to mainstream broadcasters of jokes referencing the 9/11 attacks has evolved only gradually, the DVD release of the earlier season five \"Family Guy\" episode \"Meet the Quagmires\", first broadcast in 2007, contained an extended scene which was removed from the episode as first broadcast. In the deleted scene, while traveling in time back to 1980s Quahog with Peter, Brian is confronted by the boyfriend of a woman he has been hitting on. In response to the boyfriend's challenge that he will fight Brian 'anywhere, any time', Brian invites the man to meet him \"On top of the World Trade Center, September 11th 2001 at 8am\", to which the boyfriend replies \"I will be there pal. You think I'll forget, but I won't!\". Additionally, the season seven episode \"Baby Not On Board\" features a scene in which the Griffin family visits Ground Zero, which Peter erroneously believes is \"where the first guy got AIDS.\" The season six episode \"Back to the Woods\" had Peter committing identity theft against a fictionalized James Woods, in retaliation of him doing the same and ruining his life. Peter appears on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" proving he is Woods, promoting a comedy film based on the attacks.\n\nTo improve the chance of an Oscar award, a 9/11 joke was cut from Jean Dujardin's 2012 comedy film \"The Players\". The deleted scene featured a man seducing a woman in a New York apartment while an aircraft crashes into the World Trade Center in the background.\n\nIn the days before the 15th anniversary of the attacks in 2016, Miracle Mattress of San Antonio, Texas, briefly ran a commercial promoting a sale themed around the occasion. In it the daughter of the store's owner, in conversation with two employees who stood behind her, explained how the store was recalling the Twin Towers' collapse by selling all its inventory at the price of twin-sized mattresses for the weekend with the slogan \"Twin Towers, Twin Price\". At the end of the ad, she inadvertently pushed the two employees into twin piles of mattresses behind her, one of which was topped with the American flag; both collapsed. After briefly expressing shock and horror, she turned to the camera and said \"We'll never forget\".\n\nThe company soon pulled the ad, but copies were saved and uploaded to the Internet, where it and Miracle became the subject of intense and vociferous criticism. \"Entertainment Weekly\" said it \"might be most offensive commercial ever\". Its Yelp! and Facebook pages filled with disparaging comments and calls for boycotts; the store itself also received death threat. Owner Mike Bonnano, whose daughter had, as the chain's head of marketing, conceived the commercials and starred in it, apologized profusely but eventually decided to close the San Antonio location \"indefinitely\" pending disciplinary measures and donations to the 9/11 Foundation. Miracle Mattress reopened a few days later.\n\nMemes have become a rather popular way of distributing jokes about 9/11. A lot of these memes play with or make fun of 9/11 conspiracy theories such as \"Bush did 9/11\" or \"jet fuel can't melt steel beams.\" There have also been viral Vine videos that joke about fictional characters or other famous people doing the attacks. In these vines, the creators have a clip of them, or something they throw, or perhaps an aircraft they fly, and then cut to footage of the planes hitting the Twin Towers (mostly Flight 175 hitting the South Tower). This makes fun of that character or real person, saying \"(blank) did 9/11.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "1411955", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1411955", "title": "Inalienable possession", "text": "Inalienable possession\n\nIn linguistics, inalienable possession (abbreviated ) is a type of possession in which a noun is obligatorily possessed by its possessor. Nouns or nominal affixes in an inalienable possession relationship cannot exist independently or be \"alienated\" from their possessor. For example, \"a hand\" implies \"(someone's) hand\", even if it is severed from the whole body. Likewise, \"a father\" implies \"(someone's) father\". Inalienable nouns include body parts (such as \"leg\", which is necessarily \"someone's leg\"), kinship terms (such as \"mother\"), and part-whole relations (such as \"top\"). Many languages reflect this distinction, but they vary on how they mark inalienable possession. Cross-linguistically, inalienability correlates with many morphological, syntactic, and semantic properties.\n\nIn general, the alienable‚Äìinalienable distinction is an example of a binary possessive class system, a language in which two kinds of possession are distinguished (alienable and inalienable). The alienability distinction is the most common kind of binary possessive class system, but it is not the only one. Some languages have more than two possessive classes. In Papua New Guinea, for example, An√™m has at least 20 classes and Amele has 32.\n\nStatistically, 15‚Äì20% of the world's languages have obligatory possession.\n\nThe following real-world relationships often fall under inalienable possession:\nOther things, such as most objects, may or may not be possessed. When such types of objects are possessed, the possession is alienable. Alienable possession is used generally for tangible items that one might cease to own at some point (such as \"my money\"), but inalienable possession generally refers to a perpetual relationship that cannot be readily severed (such as \"my mother\").\n\nAlthough the relationships listed above are likely to be instances of inalienable possession, what is ultimately classified as inalienable depends on conventions, specific to the language and the culture. It is impossible to say that a particular relationship is an example of inalienable possession without specifying the languages for which thar holds true. For example, \"neighbor\" may be an inalienable noun in one language but alienable in another. Thus, whether a certain type of relationship is described as alienable or inalienable can be arbitrary, and in that respect, alienability is similar to other types of noun classes such as grammatical gender.\n\nThe examples below illustrate that the same phrase, \"the table's legs\", is regarded as inalienable possession in Italian but alienable possession in French: (1b) is ungrammatical (as indicated by the asterisk). French cannot use the inalienable possession construction for a relationship that is alienable.\nBernd Heine argues that language change is responsible for the language-specific variability in categorization. That is because \"rather than being a semantically defined category, inalienability is more likely to constitute a morphosyntactic or morphophonological entity, one that owes its existence to the fact that certain nouns happened to be left out when a new pattern for marking attributive possession arose.\" Under his view, nouns that are \"ignored\" by a new marking pattern come to form a separate noun class.\n\nThe distinction between alienable and inalienable possession is often marked by various morphosyntactic properties such as morphological markers and word order. There is a strong typological pattern for inalienable possession to require fewer morphological markers than alienable possession constructions.\n\nInalienable possession constructions involve two nouns or nominals: the possessor and the possessee. Together, they form a unit, called a determiner phrase (DP). Within the DP, the possessor nominal may occur either before the possessee (prenominal) or after its possessee (postnominal), depending on the language. French, for example, can use a postnominal possessor (the possessor \"(of) Jean\" occurs after the possessee \"the arm\"):\n\nBy contrast, English generally uses a prenominal possessor (\"Johns brother\"). However, in some situations, it may also use a postnominal possessor, as in \"the brother of John\".\n\nThe South American language D√¢w uses a special possessive morpheme (bold in the examples below) to indicate alienable possession:\nThe possessive morpheme …õÃÉÃÄ…ü in examples (3) and (4) indicates an alienable relationship between the possessor and the possessee.\n\nThe possessive marker does not occur in inalienable possession constructions. Thus, the absence of …õÃÉÃÄ…ü, as in example (5), indicates that the relationship between the possessor and possessee is inalienable possession.\n\nIgbo, a West African language, deletes the possessor if the sentence's subject and the possessor of an inalienable noun both refer to the same entity. In (6a), both the referents are the same; however, it is ungrammatical to keep both of them in a sentence. Igbo employs the processes of identical possessor deletion, and the y√° (\"his\"), is dropped, as in the grammatical (6b).\n\nThe distinction between alienable and inalienable possession constructions may be marked by a difference in word order. Igbo uses another syntactic process when the subject and the possessor refer to different entities. In possessor switch, the possessor of the inalienable noun is placed as close as possible to the verb. In the following examples, the possessor y√° is not deleted because the two referents in the following sentence are different:\nIn the ungrammatical (8a), the verb \"w√†ra\" (\"to split\") follows the possessor m. Possessor switch requires the verb to be placed closer to the possessor. The grammatical (8b) does so by having \"w√†ra\" switch with the possessor:\n\nMaybrat, a language from New Guinea, varies the order of the genitive case and the noun between alienable and inalienable constructions:\n\nIn (9), the genitive Sely precedes the possessee me, marking inalienable possession.\n\nHowever, the genitive follows the possessee in alienable possession constructions, such as (10) whose genitive Petrus follows the possessee amah.\nAnother way that languages can distinguish between alienable and inalienable possession is to have one noun class that cannot appear without an explicit possessor. For example, Ojibwe, an Algonquian language, has a class of nouns that must have explicit possessors.\n\nIf explicit possessors are absent (as in (11b) and (12b)), the phrase is ungrammatical. In (11), the possessor ni is necessary for the inalienable noun nik (\"arm\"). In (12), the same phenomenon is found with the inalienable noun ookmis (\"grandmother\"), which requires the possessor morpheme n to be grammatical.\nHawaiian uses different prepositions to mark possession, depending on alienability: a (alienable \"of\") is used to indicate alienable possession, as in (13a) and (14a), and o (inalienable \"of\") indicates inalienable possession.\n\nHowever, the distinction between a (alienable \"of\") and o (inalienable \"of\") is used for other semantic distinctions that are less clearly attributable to common alienability relationships except metaphorically. Although \"lei\" is a tangible object, in Hawaiian it can be either alienable (15a) or inalienable (15b), depending on the context.\n\nSubtler cases of syntactic patterns sensitive to alienability are found in many languages. For example, French can use a definite article, rather than the possessive, for body parts.\nUsing the definite article with body parts, as in the example above, it creates ambiguity. The following sentence has both an alienable and an inalienable interpretation:\nThat type of ambiguity also occurs in English with body part constructions.\n\nSpanish also uses a definite article (las) to indicate inalienable possession for body parts.\nGerman uses a definite article (die) for inalienable body parts but a possessive (meine) for alienable possession.\nAlthough English has alienable and inalienable nouns (\"Mary's brother\" [inalienable] vs. \"Mary's squirrel\" [alienable]), there are few formal distinctions of that in the grammar. One subtle grammatical distinction is the postnominal genitive construction, which is normally used only for inalienable, relational nouns. For example, \"the brother of Mary\" [inalienable] is acceptable, but *\"the squirrel of Mary\" [alienable] would be awkward.\n\nSince the alienability distinction is rooted in semantics, in languages like English with few morphological or syntactic distinctions sensitive to alienability, ambiguities can occur. For example, the phrase \"she has her father's eyes\" has two different meanings:\nAnother example in semantic dependency is the difference between possible interpretations in a language that marks inalienable possession (such as French) with a language that does not mark it (such as English). Inalienable possession is semantically dependent and is defined in reference to another object to which it belongs. (20) is ambiguous and has two possible meanings. In the inalienable possessive interpretation, \"la main\" belongs to the subject, \"les enfants\". The second interpretation is that \"la main\" is an alienable object that does not belong to the subject. The English equivalent of the sentence (\"The children raised the hand\") had only the alienable possessive reading in which the hand does not belong to the children.\n\nSyntactically, Noam Chomsky proposed that some genitive or possessive cases originate as part of the determiner in the underlying structure. The inalienable possessives are derived from a different deep structure than that of alienable possession. For example, given the following interpretations of the phrase \"John's arm\":\nIn the inalienable reading, \"arm\" is a complement of the determiner phrase. That contrasts to the alienable reading in which \"John has an arm\" is part of the determiner. Charles J. Fillmore and Chomsky make a syntactic distinction between alienable and inalienable possession and suggest that the distinction is relevant to English.\n\nIn contrast, others have argued that although semantics plays a role in inalienable possession, it is not central to the syntactic class of case-derived possessives. For example, compare the difference between \"the book's contents\" and \"the book's jacket\". While a book cannot be divorced from its contents, it can be removed from its jacket. Still, both phrases have the same syntactic structure. Another example is \"Mary's mother\" and \"Mary's friend.\" The mother will always be Mary's mother, but an individual might not always be Mary's friend. Again, both have the same syntactic structure.\n\nThe distinction between alienable and inalienable possessions can be influenced by cognitive factors. Languages such as English that do not encode the alienability distinction in their grammar rely on the real-world relationship between the possessed noun and possessor noun. Nouns that are \"inherently relational\" and whose possession is associated with a single, dominant interpretation (\"mother\"), are of the inalienable type, and nouns whose possession is open to interpretation (\"car\") are of the alienable type.\n\nAlthough there are different methods of marking inalienability, inalienable possession constructions usually involve the following features:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(Heine 1997: 85-86 (1-6))\n\nAlienability can be expressed only in attributive possession constructions, not in predicative possession.\n\nAttributive possession is a type of possession in which the possessor and possessee form a phrase. That contrasts to predicative possession constructions in which the possessor and possessee are part of a clause and the verb affirms the possessive relationship. The examples in (21) express the same alienable relationship between possessor and possessee but illustrate the difference between attributive and predicative possession:\n\nIf a language has separate alienable and inalienable possession constructions, and if one of the constructions is overtly marked and the other is \"zero-marked\", the marked form tends to be alienable possession. Inalienable possession is indicated by the absence of the overt marker. An example is the data from D√¢w.\n\nOne typological study showed that in 78% of South American languages that distinguish between inalienable and alienable possession, inalienable possession was associated with fewer morphological markers than its alienable counterpart. By contrast, only one of the surveyed languages required more morphological features to mark inalienable possession than alienable possession. If a language makes a grammatical distinction between alienable and inalienable nouns, it is redundant to have an overt possessive marker to mark inalienability. Just by being inalienable, a noun must be possessed.\n\nIn inalienable possession constructions, the relationship between the possessor and possesee is stronger than in alienable possession constructions. Johanna Nichols characterizes that by the tendency of inalienable possession to be head-marked but alienable possession to be dependent-marked. In head-marking, the head of an inalienable possession construction (the possessed noun) is marked, but in dependent-marking, the dependent (the possessor noun) is marked.\n\nSince the possessor is crucially linked to an inalienable noun's meaning, inalienable nouns are assumed to take their possessors as a semantic argument. Possessors (to either alienable or inalienable nouns) can be expressed with different constructions. Possessors in the genitive case (such as \"the friend of Mary\") appear as complements to the possessed noun, as part of the phrase headed by the inalienable noun. That is an example of internal possession since the possessor of the noun is inside of the determiner phrase.\n\nInalienable possession can also be marked with external possession. Such are constructions have the possessor appearing outside the determiner phrase. For example, the possessor may appear as a dative complement of the verb.\n\nFrench exhibits both external possessor construction and internal possessor construction, as in (22):\nHowever, those types of possessors are problematic. There is a discrepancy between the possessor appearing syntactically in an inalienable possession construction and what its semantic relationship to the inalienable noun seems to be. Semantically, the possessor of an inalienable noun is intrinsic to its meaning and acts like a semantic argument. On the surface syntactic structure, however, the possessor appears in a position that marks it as an argument of the verb. Thus, there are different views on how those types of inalienable possession constructions should be represented in the syntactic structure. The binding hypothesis argues that the possessor is an argument of the verb. Conversely, the possessor-raising hypothesis argues that the possessor originates as an argument of the possessed noun and then moves to a position in which on the surface, it looks like it is an argument of the verb.\n\nThe binding hypothesis reconciles the fact that the possessor appears both as a syntactic and semantic argument of the verb but as a semantic argument of the possessed noun. It assumes that inalienable possession constructions are subject to the following syntactic constraints:\nIt is assumed that inalienable possession constructions are one form of anaphoric binding: obligatory control. Thus, the possessor DP originates in the specifier of the verb; the fact that the possessor seems to be a semantic argument of the noun arises from the binding relationship between the possessor and possessee DPs. The parallel between inalienable possession constructions and obligatory control can be seen in the examples below:\nThat hypothesis accounts for differences between French and English, and it may also eliminate the ambiguity created by definite determiners. According to this hypothesis, anaphoric binding in inalienable possession constructions relates to the theta-features that a language assigns to its determiners. Thay hypothesis predicts that inalienable possession constructions exist in languages that assign variable theta-features to its determiners and that inalienable possession constructions do not exist in languages that lack variable theta-feature assignment. Therefore, inalienable possession is predicted to exist in Romance languages and even Russian but not in languages like English or Hebrew. In the French sentence \"Il l√®ve les mains\", the determiner \"les\" is assigned theta-features. Thus, it is understood as inalienable possession. However, in the English translation, the determiner \"the\" does not have theta-features because English is considered does not assign theta-features to its determiners. Therefore, \"the\" does not necessarily signify inalienable possession and so ambiguity surfaces.\n\nThat hypothesis, however, does not account for verbs allowing reflexive anaphora (\"Jean se\" lave 'Jean washes himself'). To account for the grammaticality of such verbs, Gu√©ron proposes that in an inalienable construction the POSS DP (possessor DP) and BP DP (body part DP) constitute two links of a lexical chain, in addition to their anaphoric relation. The two links of a lexical chain must obey the same constraints as anaphora, which accounts for the locality restrictions on inalienable construals. Every chain is then associated with one theta-role. Inalienable possession surfaces as ungrammatical when the possessed DP and the possessor DP are assigned two different theta-roles by the verb. That explains why sentence (24b) is ungrammatical. The POSS DP is assigned an agent theta-role, anf the BP DP is assigned a theme theta-role.\nPossessor-raising is a syntactic hypothesis that attempts to explain the structures of inalienable DPs. Landau argues that the possessor is initially introduced in the specifier position of DP (Spec-DP), but it later raises to the specifier of the VP. The possessor DP gets its theta-role from the head D, and that gives rise to the meaning that the possessor is related to the possessee.\n\nLandau's analysis is made on the basis of several properties possessives in the data case in Romance languages.\n\nThe French data below illustrate how that is thought to work. The possessor \"lui\" originates in the specifier of DP as an argument of the noun \"figure\". That is equivalent to an underlying structure \"Gilles a lav√© lui la figure.\" The possessor raises to the specifier of VP, which is seen in the surface structure \"Gilles lui a lav√© la figure.\"\n\nAccording to Gu√©ron, a benefit of the hypothesis is that it is consistent with principles of syntactic movement such as locality of selection and c-command. If the position to which it needs to move is already filled, as with a transitive verb like \"see\", the possessor cannot raise, and the sentence is correctly predicted to be ungrammatical.\n\nHowever, some languages such as Russian do not have to raise the DP possessor and can leave it \"in situ\", making it unclear why the possessor would ever have to raise. Possessor-raising also violates a constraint on syntactic movement, the specificity constraint: an element cannot be moved out of a DP if that DP is specific. In (23), the DP \"lui\" is specific, yet possessor-raising predicts it can be moved out of the larger DP \"lui la figure\". Such movement is excluded by the specificity constraint.\n\nInalienable possession constructions often lack overt possessors. There is a debate as to how to account for the linguistically-universal difference in form. Iconicity explains the in terms of the relationship between the conceptual distance between the possessor and possessee, and economy explains it by the frequency of possession.\n\nHaiman describes iconic expression and conceptual distance and how both concepts are conceptually close if they share semantic properties, affect each other and cannot be separated from each other. Joseph Greenberg hypothesizes that the distance between the possessor and possessee in a sentence with alienable possession is greater than in a sentence with inalienable constructions. Because the possessor and the possessee have a close conceptual relationship, their relative positions with a sentence reflect thay and there is little distance between them. Increasing the distance between the two would, in turn, increase their conceptual independence.\n\nThat is demonstrated in Yagaria, a Papuan language. It marks alienable possession by a free form pronoun as in (27a). In contrast, inalienable possession constructions use an inalienable possessor prefixed on the possessee, as in (27b). That construction has less linguistic distance between the possessor and possessee than in the alienable construction:\nHowever, there are cases of linguistic distance not necessarily reflecting conceptual distance. In Mandarin Chinese, there are two ways to express the same type of possession, POSSESSOR + POSSESSEE and POSSESSOR + de + POSSESSEE; the latter has more linguistic distance between the possessor and possessee, but it reflects the same conceptual distance. Both possessive expressions, with and without the marker de, are found in the Mandarin phrase \"my friend\", seen in (28a) compared to (28b):\n\nIn contrast to the previous example, the omission of the marker \"de\" is ungrammatical, as in example (29b). The linguistic distance between the possessor and possessee is much smaller in (29b) than in (29a). It has been argued that the omission of \"de\" occurs only in kinship relationships, but phrasal constructions with a mandatory \"de\" encompasses other inalienable possession examples, such as body parts. That contradicts the notion that inalienable possession is marked by less linguistic distance between the possessor and possessee.\nNichols notes that frequently-possessed nouns, such as body parts and kinship terms, almost always occur with possessors, and alienable nouns occur with possessors less often.\n\nThe following shows the frequency of possession between alienable and unalienable nouns in German. The table below shows the number of times each noun occurred with or without a possessor in texts from the German Goethe-Corpus, the works by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.\nThe alienable nouns above are rarely possessed, but the inalienable kinship terms are frequently possessed. Consequently, inalienable nouns are expected to be possessed even if they lack a distinct possessive marker. Therefore, overt markings on inalienable nouns are redundant, and to employ economical syntactic construction, languages often zero-mark their inalienable nouns.\n\nThat could be explained by Zipf's Law in which the familiarity or the frequency of an occurrence motivates the linguistic simplification of the concept. A listener who hears an inalienable noun can predict that it will be possessed, thereby eliminating the need for an overt possessor.\n\nOld Rapa is the indigenous language of Rapa Iti, an island of French Polynesia located within its Bass Islands archipelago. Within the language structure of Rapa are two primary possessive particles, a and o. The usage of the two particles is dependent on the relation between the possessor and the object. When words of the language are categorized by possessive particles, there is a very close resemblance to the usage of the possessive particle and the object's alienability. However, this relation is better defined by William Wilson in his article \"Proto-Polynesian Possessive Marking\".\n\nBriefly, through his two theories, the Simple Control Theory and Initial Control Theory, Wilson can contrast and thus better define the usage of the possessive particles, a and o. The Simple Control Theory speculates that the determining factor directly correlated to the possessor‚Äôs control over the object; emphasizing a dominant vs. less-dominant relationship. Old Rapa adheres closer to the latter of Wilson's two theories, the Initial Control Theory, which speculates that \"the possessor's control over the initiation of the possessive relationship is the determining factor.\" Here, his Initial Control Theory can also be generally expanded to the whole Polynesian language family in terms of better describing the \"alienability\" of possession.\n\nIn the case of Old Rapa, the possession particle, o, is used to define a possession relationship that was not initiated on the basis of choice. The possession particle, a, is defines possession relationships that are initiated through the possessor's control. The following list and classifications are literal examples provided by Mary Walworth, in her dissertation of the Rapa language. Words that are marked with the o possessive markers are nouns that are:\nHowever, Wilson's theory does fall short in properly categorizing a few miscellaneous items such as articles of clothing and furniture that his theory would incorrectly predict to be marked with an a-possessive particle. The reverse would occur forobjects such as food and animals. The synthesis of Wilson's theory and other approach a better understanding of the Rapa language. Svenja V√∂lkel proposed the idea of looking further into the ritualistic beliefs of the community, namely their mana. That idea has been relatable to other languages in the Eastern Polynesian language family, and it states that objects that possess less mana than the possessor are indicated with the a-possessive particle, and the usage of the o-possessive marker is reserved for the possessor‚Äôs mana not being superior.\n\nThe same usage of the possessive particles, a and o, in possessive pronouns can be seen in the contracted portmanteau, the combination of the articles and possessive markers. The resultants are the t≈ç and tƒÅ prefixes in the following possessive pronouns, as can be seen in the table below:\nWuvulu language is a small language spoken in Wuvulu Island. Direct possession has a close relationship with inalienability in the Oceanic linguistics. Similarly, the inherent possession of the possessor is called the possessum.\n\nThe inalienable noun also has a possessor suffix and includes body parts, kin terms, locative part nouns, and derived nouns. According to Hafford's research, \"-u\" (my), \"-mu\" (your) and \"na-\"Ôºàhis/her/its) are three direct possession suffix in Wuvulu.\nDirect- possession suffix \"-u\"(my), \"-mu\" (your) and \"na-\"Ôºàhis/her/its) can be taken to attach the noun phrase of body part.\n\nKin terms in Wuvulu language take singular possessive suffixes.\n\nExample:\n\n îei wareamu (Your word) is derived from the verb ware (talk)\n\nThis kind of word can take the direct possessor suffix. \"-mu\" (your {singular])\n\nfa îua,  îei ware-a-mu\n\ntrue the talk-DER-2SG\n\nYour words are true.\n\nHere is a table displaying the predicative possessive pronouns in Tokelauan:\n\nHere is a table showing Tokelauan premodifying possessive pronouns:\n\n"}

{"id": "19337442", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19337442", "title": "Kathoey", "text": "Kathoey\n\nKathoey or katoey (; ) is a transgender woman or an effeminate gay male in Thailand. Transgender women in Thailand mostly use terms other than kathoey when referring to themselves, such as \"phuying\" (Thai: ‡∏ú‡∏π‡πâ‡∏´‡∏ç‡∏¥‡∏á \"women\"). A significant number of Thai people perceive kathoey as belonging to a third gender, including some trans women themselves.\n\nMost transgender women in Thai society refer to themselves as \"phuying\" (Thai: ‡∏ú‡∏π‡πâ‡∏´‡∏ç‡∏¥‡∏á \"women\"), with a minority referring to themselves as \"phuying praphet song\" (a \"second kind of woman\") and only very few referring to themselves as \"kathoey\". Related phrases include \"phet thi sam\" (, \"third gender\"), and \"sao praphet song\" or \"phu ying praphet song\" (‚Äîboth meaning \"second-type female\"). The word \"kathoey\" is of Khmer origin. It is most often rendered as \"ladyboy\" or \"lady boy\" in English conversation with Thais, an expression that has become popular across Southeast Asia.\n\nAlthough \"kathoey\" is often translated as \"transgender\" in the English usage, this term is not used frequently in Thailand. As well as trans individuals, the term can refer to gay men, and was originally used to refer to intersex individuals. Before the 1960s, the use of kathoey included anyone who deviated from the dominant and sexual norms. Because of this confusion in translation, the English translation of \"kathoey\" is usually \"ladyboy\" (or variants of the term).\n\nUse of the term \"kathoey\" suggests that the person self-identifies as a type of male, in contrast to \"sao praphet song\" (which, like \"trans woman\", suggests a \"female\" (\"sao\") gender identity), and in contrast to \"phet thi sam\" (which means \"third gender\"). The term \"phu ying praphet song\", which can be translated as \"second-type female\", is also used to refer to \"kathoey\". Australian scholar of sexual politics in Thailand Peter Jackson claims that the term \"kathoey\" was used in pre-modern times to refer to intersex people, and that the usage changed in the mid-20th century to cover cross-dressing males. Kathoey became an iconic symbol of modern Thai culture. The term can refer to males who exhibit varying degrees of femininity. Many dress as women and undergo \"feminising\" medical procedures such as breast implants, hormones, silicone injections, or Adam's apple reductions. Others may wear makeup and use feminine pronouns, but dress as men, and are closer to the Western category of effeminate gay man than transgender.\n\nThe term \"\"kathoey\" may be considered pejorative, especially in the form \"kathoey-saloey\"\". It has a meaning similar to the English language \"fairy\" or \"queen\". \"Kathoey\" can also be seen as a derogatory word for those who self-identify as gay.\n\nBunmi, a Thai Buddhist author, believes that the origins of homosexuality stems from \"lower level spirits\" (phi-sang-thewada), a factor that is influenced by one's past life. Buddhists view kathoeys as the marking of an individual who is born with a disability as a direct consequence for their past sins.\n\nIn 1965, Hopkins Hospital became the first institution to perform gender reassignment surgery (GRS). Now, popular cities such as Bangkok, Thailand, are performing two to three gender operations per week, more than 3,500 GRSs over the past thirty years. With the massive increase in GRSs, there has also been an increase in prerequisites, measures that must be taken in order to be eligible for the operation. Patients must be at least 18 years old and permission from parents if under 20 years old. One must provide evidence of diagnosis of gender dysphoria from a psychologist or psychiatrist. Before going through gender reassignment surgery, one must be on hormones/antiandrogens for at least one year. Patients must have a note from the psychiatrist or clinical psychologist. Two months prior to the surgery, patients are required to see a psychiatrist in Thailand to confirm eligibility for sex reassignment surgery.\n\nMany \"kathoey\" work in predominately female occupations, such as in shops, restaurants, and beauty salons, but also in factories (a reflection of Thailand's high proportion of female industrial workers). \"Kathoey\" also work in entertainment and tourist centers, in cabarets, and as sex workers. \"Kathoey\" sex workers have high rates of HIV.\n\n\"Kathoeys\" are more visible and more accepted in Thai culture than transgender people are in other countries in the world. Several popular Thai models, singers and movie stars are \"kathoey\"s, and Thai newspapers often print photographs of the winners of female and \"kathoey\" beauty contests side by side. The phenomenon is not restricted to urban areas; there are \"kathoey\"s in most villages, and \"kathoey\" beauty contests are commonly held as part of local fairs.\n\nUsing the notion of karma, some Thai believe that being a \"kathoey\" is the result of transgressions in past lives, concluding that \"kathoey\" deserve pity rather than blame.\n\nA common stereotype is that older, well-off \"kathoey\" provide financial support to young men with whom they are in a personal relationship.\n\n\"Kathoey\"s currently face many social and legal impediments. Families (and especially fathers) are typically disappointed if a child becomes a \"kathoey\", and \"kathoey\"s often have to face the prospect of coming out. However, \"kathoey\" generally have greater acceptance in Thailand than most other Asian countries. Legal recognition of \"kathoey\"s and transgender individuals is non-existent in Thailand: even if trans people have had genital reassignment surgery, they are not allowed to change their legal sex. Discrimination in employment also remains rampant. Problems can also arise in regards to access to amenities and gender allocation; for example, a \"kathoey\" and a transgender person who has undergone sexual reassignment surgery would still have to stay in an all-male prison.\n\nKathoeys began to gain prominence in the cinema of Thailand during the late 1980s. The depiction at first was negative by showing kathoeys suffering from bad karma, suicide, and abandoned by straight lovers. Independent and experimental films contributed to defying sexual norms in queer cinema in the 1990s. The 2000 film \"The Iron Ladies\", directed by Yongyoot Thongkongtoon, depicted a positive portrayal of an almost entirely kathoey volleyball team by displaying their confidence. The rising middle-class in Bangkok and vernacular queer culture made the mainstream portrayal of kathoeys more popular on television and in art-house cinema.\n\nFeminine beauty in Thailand allowed transgender individuals to have their own platform where they are able to challenge stereotypes and claim cultural recognition. Miss Tiffany's Universe is a beauty contest that is opened to all transgender women. Beginning in 1998, the pageant takes place every year in Pattaya, Thailand during May. With over 100 applicants, the pageant is considered to be one of the most popular transgender pageants in the world. Through beauty pageants, Thailand has been able to promote the country's cosmetic surgery industry, which has had a massive increase in medical tourism for sex reassignment surgery. According to the Miss Tiffany's Universe website, the live broadcast attracts record of 15 million viewers. The winner of the pageant receives a tiara, sash, car, grand price of 100,000 baht (US$3,000), equivalent to a yearly wage for a Thai factory worker. The assistant manager director, Alisa Phanthusak, stated that the pageant wants kathoeys to be visible and to treat them as normal. It is the biggest annual event in Pattaya.\n\nTransgender beauty contests are found in the countryside at village fairs or festivals. All-male revues are common in gay bars in Bangkok and as drag shows in the tourist resort of Pattaya.\n\nIn 1993, Thailand's teacher training colleges implemented a semi-formal ban on allowing homosexual (which included \"kathoey\") students enrolling in courses leading to qualification for positions in kindergartens and primary schools. In January 1997, the Rajabhat Institutes (the governing body of the colleges) announced it would formalize the ban, which would extend to all campuses at the start of the 1997 academic year. The ban was quietly rescinded later in the year, following the replacement of the Minister of Education.\n\nIn 1996, a volleyball team composed mostly of gays and \"kathoey\"s, known as \"The Iron Ladies\" (, \"satree lek\"), later portrayed in two Thai movies, won the Thai national championship. The Thai government, concerned with the country's image, barred two of the \"kathoey\"s from joining the national team and competing internationally.\n\nAmong the most famous \"kathoey\"s in Thailand is Nong Tum, a former champion Thai boxer who emerged into the public eye in 1998. She would present in a feminine manner and had commenced hormone therapy while still a popular boxer; she would enter the ring with long hair and makeup, occasionally kissing a defeated opponent. She announced her retirement from professional boxing in 1999¬†‚Äì undergoing genital reassignment surgery, while continuing to work as a coach, and taking up acting and modeling. She returned to boxing in 2006.\n\nIn 2004, the Chiang Mai Technology School allocated a separate restroom for \"kathoey\"s, with an intertwined male and female symbol on the door. The 15 \"kathoey\" students are required to wear male clothing at school but are allowed to sport feminine hairdos. The restroom features four stalls, but no urinals.\n\nFollowing the 2006 Thai coup d'√©tat, \"kathoey\"s are hoping for a new third sex to be added to passports and other official documents in a proposed new constitution. In 2007, legislative efforts have begun to allow \"kathoey\"s to change their legal sex if they have undergone genital reassignment surgery; this latter restriction was controversially discussed in the community.\n\nBell Nuntita, a contestant of \"Thailand's Got Talent\" TV shows, became a YouTube hit when she first performed singing as a girl and then switched to a masculine voice.\n\nIt is estimated that as many as six in every thousand individuals assigned as male at birth later present themselves as transwomen or phu-ying kham-phet.\n\nThai activists have mobilized for over two decades to secure sexual diversity rights. Beauty pageant winner Yollada Suanyot, known as Nok, founded the Trans Female Association of Thailand on the basis of changing sex-designation on identification cards for post-operative transsexual women. Nok promoted the term phuying kham-phet instead of kathoey but was controversial because of its connotation with gender identity disease. The goal of the Thai Transgender Alliance is to de-list gender dysphoria from international psychological diagnostic criteria and uses the term kathoey to advocate for transgender identity. A common protest sign during gender rights marches is \"Kathoey mai chai rok-jit\" meaning \"Kathoey are not mentally ill.\"\n\nActivism in Thailand is discouraged if it interferes with official policy. In January 2006, the Thai Network of People Living With HIV/AIDS had their offices raided after demonstrations against Thai-US foreign trade agreements. Under the Thai Constitution of 1997, the right to be free of discrimination based on health conditions helped to minimize the stigma against communities living with HIV/AIDS. In most cases, governments and their agencies fail to protect transgender people against these exclusions. There is a lack of HIV/AIDS services for specifically transgender people and feminizing hormones largely go without any medical monitoring.\n\nTransprejudice has produced discriminatory behaviors that have led to the exclusion of transgender people from economic and social activity. Worldwide, transgender people face discrimination amongst family members, religious settings, education, and the workplace. Accepted mainly in fashion-related jobs or show business, individuals who identify as transgender are discriminated in the job market and have limited job opportunities. Kathoeys have also experienced ridicule from coworkers and tend to have lower salaries. Long-term unemployment reduces the chances of contributing to welfare for the family and lowers self-esteem causing a higher likelihood of sex work in specialized \"ladyboy\" bars. \"Ladyboy\" bars also can provide a sense of community and reinforces a female sense of identity for kathoeys. Harassment from the police is evident especially for kathoeys who work on the streets. Kathoeys may be rejected in official contexts being rejected entry or services.\n\nBased on a study by AIDS Care participants that identified as a girl or kathoey at an early age were more likely to be exposed to transphobia or violence from men in the family. Kathoeys are more subjected to sexual attack from men than are homosexuals.\n\nAnjaree is one of Thailand's feminist-lesbian organization that was established in mid 1986 by women's right activists. The organization advocated wider public understanding of same-sex sexuality based on the transnational language of human rights. The first public campaign was launched in 1996 opposing gender/sex deviance.\n\nSocial spaces are often limited for kathoeys even if Thai society does not actively persecute them. Indigenous cultural traditions have given a social space for gender-diverse individuals of Thailand. In January 2015, Thailand announced it would recognize the third gender in its constitution in order to ensure all genders be treated equally under the law.\n\nIdentity cards are particularly important in Thailand. The vast majority of trans people in the country were unable to change their documents at all, and those who are able to were held to rather severe standards. IDs facilitate many daily activities such as interface with businesses, bureaucratic agencies (i.e., signing up for educational courses or medical care), law enforcement, etc. Impeded by these identity cards on a daily basis, transgender individuals are \"outed\" by society. The requirement facilitated by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) that does not offer transgender people the opportunity to change their personal documentation remains as a threat to privacy for the trans community in Thailand. There is no question that the country's rigid bureaucratic rules are still adjusting to incorporate transgender rights.\n\nTransgender individuals were automatically exempted from compulsory military service in Thailand. Kathoeys were deemed to suffer from \"mental illness\" or \"permanent mental disorder\". These mental disorders were required to appear on their military service documents, which are accessible to future employers. In 2006, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of Thailand overturned the use of discriminatory phraseology in Thailand's military service exemption documents. With Thai law banning citizens to change their gender on their identification documents, everyone under the male category must attend a \"lottery day\" where they are randomly selected to enlist in the army for two years. In March 2008, the military added a \"third category\" for transsexuals that dismissed them from service due to \"illness that cannot be cured within 30 days\".\n\nThe first all \"kathoey\" music group in Thailand was formed in 2006. It is named Venus Flytrap and was selected and promoted by Sony BMG Music Entertainment. The Lady Boys of Bangkok is a \"kathoey\" revue that has been performed in the UK since 1998 touring the country in both theatres and the famous \"Sabai Pavilion\" for nine months each year.\n\n\"Ladyboys\", also a popular term used in Thailand when referring to a transgender woman, was the title of a popular documentary in the United Kingdom, where it was aired on Channel 4 TV in 1992 and was directed by Jeremy Marre. Marre aimed to portray the life of two teenage kathoeys living in the rural part of Thailand, as they strived to land a job at a cabaret revue located in the popular city known as Pattaya.\n\nThe German-Swedish band Lindemann wrote the song \"Ladyboy\", on their first studio album \"Skills in Pills\", about a man's preference of kathoeys.\n\nIn the TV series \"I'm Alan Partridge\", the protagonist regularly mentions ladyboys, seemingly expressing a sexual interest in them.\n\nThai kathoey style and fashion has largely borrowed from Korean pop culture.\n\n\"Uncle Go Paknam\", created by Pratchaya Phanthathorn, is a popular gay and lesbian advice column that first appeared in 1975 in a magazine titled \"Plaek\", meaning \"strange.\" Through letters and responses it became an outlet to express the desires and necessities of the LGBT community in Thailand. The magazine achieved national popularity because of its bizarre and often queer content. It portrayed positive accounts of kathoeys and men called \"sharks\" to view transgender people as legitimate or even preferred sexual partners and started queer-accepting public discourse in Thailand. Under the pen name of Phan Thathron he wrote the column \"Girls to the Power of 2\" that included profiles of kathoeys in a glamorous or provocative pose. \"Girls to the Power of 2\" were the first accounts of kathoey lives based on interviews that allowed their voices to be published in the national mainstream press of Thailand. The heterosexual public became more inclined to read about new transgender communities that were previously given negative press in Thai newspapers. Go Paknam's philosophy was \"kathoeys are good (for men).\"\n\nA documentary entitled \"Inside Thailand's Third Gender\" examines the lives of ladyboys in Thailand and features interviews with various transgender women, the obstacles these individuals face with their family and lovers, but moreover on a larger societal aspect where they feel outcast by the religious Thai culture. Following contestants participating in one of the largest transgender beauty pageants, known as Miss Tiffany's Universe, the film not only illustrates the process and competitiveness that takes place during the beauty pageant, but also highlights the systems of oppression that take place to target the transgender community in Thailand.\n\n"}

He is best known for developing the theory underlying the literacy philosophy of whole language.\n\nAfter publishing an influential book on the subject, Goodman began to create a psycholinguistic and sociolinguistic model of reading inspired by the work of Noam Chomsky. Goodman decided that the process of reading was similar to the process of learning a language as conceptualized by Chomsky, and that literacy developed naturally as a consequence of experiences with print, just as language ability developed naturally as a consequence of experiences with language. Goodman concluded that attempts to teach rules (\"phonics\") to children for decoding words were inappropriate and not likely to succeed.\n\nAfter developing and researching the Whole Language model, Goodman presented his work to the American Educational Research Association (AERA) conference and published an article in the \"Journal of the Reading Specialist,\" in which he famously wrote that reading is a \"psycholinguistic guessing game.\" He retired from the University of Arizona in August 1998.\n\nGoodman's concept of written language development views it as parallel to oral language development. Goodman's theory was a basis for the whole language movement, which was further developed by Yetta Goodman, Regie Routman, Frank Smith and others. His concept of reading as an analogue to language development has been studied by brain researchers such as Sally Shaywitz, who rejected the theory on the grounds that reading does not develop naturally in the absence of instruction. Despite this, the theory continues to receive support from some scholars. Goodman's theory and strong convictions made him an icon of the whole language movement and a lightning rod for criticism from those who disgree with it. His book \"What's Whole in Whole Language\" sold over 250,000 copies in six languages.\n\nGoodman is a controversial figure in the education community. He has served in several important capacities, including as President of the International Reading Association, President of the National Conference on Research in Language and Literacy, and President of the Center for Expansion of Language and Thinking. He also worked extensively with the National Council of Teachers of English. He received a number of awards, including the James Squire award from NCTE for contributions to the profession and NCTE (2007). Goodman has published over 150 articles and book chapters as well as a number of books. In addition to \"What's Whole in Whole Language\", he also wrote \"Ken Goodman on Reading\" and \"Phonics Phacts\"; all were published by Heinemann. His latest book is \"Scientific Realism in Studies of Education\", which was published by Taylor and Francis in 2007.\n"}

{"id": "18077", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=18077", "title": "Lexicon", "text": "Lexicon\n\nA lexicon, word-hoard, wordbook, or word-stock is the vocabulary of a person, language, or branch of knowledge (such as nautical or medical). In linguistics, a lexicon is a language's inventory of lexemes. The word \"lexicon\" derives from the Greek (\"lexicon\"), neuter of (\"lexikos\") meaning \"of or for words.\"\n\nLinguistic theories generally regard human languages as consisting of two parts: a lexicon, essentially a catalogue of a language's words (its wordstock); and a grammar, a system of rules which allow for the combination of those words into meaningful sentences. The lexicon is also thought to include bound morphemes, which cannot stand alone as words (such as most affixes). In some analyses, compound words and certain classes of idiomatic expressions and other collocations are also considered to be part of the lexicon. Dictionaries represent attempts at listing, in alphabetical order, the lexicon of a given language; usually, however, bound morphemes are not included.\n\nItems in the lexicon are called lexemes, or lexical items, or word forms. Lexemes are not atomic elements but contain both phonological and morphological components. When describing the lexicon, a reductionist approach is used, trying to remain general while using a minimal description. To describe the size of a lexicon, lexemes are grouped into lemmas. A lemma is a group of lexemes generated by inflectional morphology. Lemmas are represented in dictionaries by headwords which list the citation forms and any irregular forms, since these must be learned to use the words correctly. Lexemes derived from a word by derivational morphology are considered new lemmas. The lexicon is also organized according to open and closed categories. Closed categories, such as determiners or pronouns, are rarely given new lexemes; their function is primarily syntactic. Open categories, such as nouns and verbs, have highly active generation mechanisms and their lexemes are more semantic in nature.\n\nA central role of the lexicon is the documenting of established \"lexical norms and conventions\". Lexicalization is the process in which new words, having gained widespread usage, enter the lexicon. Since lexicalization may modify lexemes phonologically and morphologically, it is possible that a single etymological source may be inserted into a single lexicon in two or more forms. These pairs, called a doublet, are often close semantically. Two examples are \"aptitude\" versus \"attitude\" and \"employ\" versus \"imply\".\n\nThe mechanisms, not mutually exclusive, are:\n\nNeologisms are new lexeme candidates which, if they gain wide usage over time, become part of a language's lexicon. Neologisms are often introduced by children who produce erroneous forms by mistake. Another common source is slang and activities such as advertising and branding.\n\nThere are two types of borrowings (neologisms based on external sources) that retain the sound of the source language material:\n\nThe following are examples of external lexical expansion using the source language lexical item as the basic material for the neologization, listed in decreasing order of phonetic resemblance to the original lexical item (in the source language):\n\nThe following are examples of simultaneous external and internal lexical expansion using target language lexical items as the basic material for the neologization but still resembling the sound of the lexical item in the source language:\n\nAnother mechanism involves generative devices that combine morphemes according to a language's rules. For example, the suffix \"-able\" is usually only added to transitive verbs, as in \"readable\" but not \"cryable\".\n\nA compound word is a lexeme composed of several established lexemes, whose semantics is not the sum of that of their constituents. They can be interpreted through analogy, common sense and, most commonly, context. Compound words can have simple or complex morphological structures. Usually only the head requires inflection for agreement. Compounding may result in lexemes of unwieldy proportion. This is compensated by mechanisms that reduce the length of words. A similar phenomenon has been recently shown to feature in social media also where hashtags compound to form longer-sized hashtags that are at times more popular than the individual constituent hashtags forming the compound. Compounding is the most common of word formation strategies cross-linguistically. \n\nComparative historical linguistics studies the evolutions languages and takes a diachronic view of the lexicon. The evolution of lexicons in different languages occurs through parallel mechanism. Over time historical forces work to shape the lexicon, making it simpler to acquire and often creating an illusion of great regularity in language.\n\nThe term \"lexicon\" is generally used in the context of single language. Therefore, multi-lingual speakers are generally thought to have multiple lexicons. Speakers of language variants (Brazilian Portuguese and European Portuguese, for example) may be considered to possess a single lexicon. Thus a \"cash dispenser\" (British English) as well as an automatic teller machine or ATM in American English would be understood by both American and British speakers, despite each group using different dialects.\n\nWhen linguists study a lexicon, they consider such things as what constitutes a word; the word/concept relationship; lexical access and lexical access failure; how a word's phonology, syntax, and meaning intersect; the morphology-word relationship; vocabulary structure within a given language; language use (pragmatics); language acquisition; the history and evolution of words (etymology); and the relationships between words, often studied within philosophy of language.\n\nVarious models of how lexicons are organized and how words are retrieved have been proposed in psycholinguistics, neurolinguistics and computational linguistics.\n\n\n"}

{"id": "47078194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=47078194", "title": "Meninism", "text": "Meninism\n\nMeninism is term used which has been used to describe various groups, including the men's rights movement, and male feminists. The term is sometimes used sincerely to challenge social issues facing men, and sometimes satirically or semi-satirically as a word-play on feminism. Members of these groups are known as meninists.\n\nThe term meninism was used in the early 2000s to describe male feminists who opposed sexism and supported women's right for equality in society, politics and at work. By the next decade, the term was used on social media to make jokes which mocked and criticised radical feminism. In 2013 the BBC reported that the hashtag #MeninistTwitter was being used on Twitter, first to share jokes about feminism, but later to share more serious difficulties facing modern men. In 2015, Nolan Feeney of \"Time\" reported that those who used meninist hashtags \"generally fall in two camps: people who use the term to call out ways they believe they‚Äôve been victimised by feminism, and people who make fun of the first group for not understanding what feminism means in the first place\". Antifeminism is also associated with terms like Meninism\n\nThe term has partially evolved into a movement promoting awareness of the issues which the movement perceives as affecting men, opposition to the perceived oppression men face in the 21st century, opposition to the way some perceive that men are victimised by modern-day feminism, and occasionally violence against men. Women also identify as meninists.\n\nAccording to Martin Daubney of \"The Telegraph\", some meninists have used the term to discuss serious issues affecting men, such as domestic violence against men; fathers' rights and divorce issues; and disproportionate male prison sentences, suicide rates, and rates of homelessness. According to Radhika Sanghani of \"The Telegraph\", the hashtag is most commonly used on Twitter to mock feminism, but has also been used as a way to draw attention to men's issues, similar to \"The Red Pill\" forum on Reddit. Sanghani says that the movement's reaction to feminism is based more on the label than feminism's views. Abigail James writing for \"Catholic Online\" said that while meninism raises legitimate issues which should be taken seriously, its heart is based on a misinterpretation of the meaning of feminism. Antifeminism is also associated with the Meninist movement.\n\nMintified, an India-based media website, started the #BlameOneNotAll hashtag to discourage generalisations of men. According to Victoria Richards of \"The Independent\", the campaign was part of the meninist movement. The campaign received backlash for shifting focus away from the victims of rape and implying that basic decency should be rewarded. In an opinion piece for \"The Economic Times\" Shephali Bhatt criticised the use of the movement and International Men's Day to sell deodorant, saying \"...for an initiative to become a social phenomena, it needs to be rooted in truth. And the truth is that [men are] a sufficiently privileged gender, comparatively.\"\n\nThe hashtags have also been used for T-shirts and similar, with self-portraits of people wearing the clothes widely shared on social media. Several outlets reported that the clothes and images were widely mocked, and often Photoshopped sarcastically.\n"}

Although the NFL Draft dates back to 1936, the first person to officially be given the \"Mr. Irrelevant\" title was Kelvin Kirk, pick number 487 of the 1976 draft. The current Mr. Irrelevant is Trey Quinn, former wide receiver for the SMU Mustangs football team, who was picked 256th by the Washington Redskins in the 2018 draft.\n\n\"Mr. Irrelevant\" and \"Irrelevant Week\" arose in 1976, when former Southern California and NFL receiver Paul Salata founded the event in Newport Beach, California. He continued to announce the final pick of the NFL draft until 2013; from 2014 his daughter took over in announcing the pick. During the summer after the draft, the new Mr. Irrelevant and his family are invited to spend a week in Newport Beach where they enjoy a golf tournament, a regatta, a roast giving advice to the new draftee, and a ceremony awarding him the Lowsman Trophy. The trophy mimics the Heisman, but depicts a player fumbling a football.\n\n\"Irrelevant Week\" gave so much publicity to \"Mr. Irrelevant\" that in 1979 the Los Angeles Rams, with the penultimate pick, intentionally passed to let the Pittsburgh Steelers, with the last pick, choose first. The Steelers also wanted the publicity and passed as well. The two teams continued to refuse to choose a player until NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle forced the teams to pick. The incident led to the \"Salata Rule\", which prohibits teams from passing to get the final pick.\n\nSince the NFL draft was cut to its current seven-round format in 1994, players presented with this dubious honor have more often succeeded in making the team that drafted them, with some making significant contributions on the field.\n\nOne \"Mr. Irrelevant\" (who actually predated the award by nearly a decade) went on to a productive professional career in another sport. Jimmy Walker was the final pick in 1967 despite never having played college football. His main sport, however, was basketball, in which he was a consensus All-American and the nation's leading scorer as a senior at Providence College. Walker was the first pick in the 1967 NBA Draft, and opted for a career in the NBA.\n\n\n"}

There are also obligations in other normative contexts, such as obligations of etiquette, social obligations, religious and possibly in terms of politics, where obligations are requirements which must be fulfilled. These are generally legal obligations, which can incur a penalty for non-fulfilment, although certain people are obliged to carry out certain actions for other reasons as well, whether as a tradition or for social reasons.\n\nObligations vary from person to person: for example, a person holding a political office will generally have far more obligations than an average adult citizen, who themselves will have more obligations than a child. Obligations are generally granted in return for an increase in an individual's rights or power. For example, obligations for health and safety in a workplace from employer to employee maybe to ensure the fire exit is not blocked or ensure that the plugs are put in firmly.\n\nThe word \"obligation\" can also designate a written obligation, or such things as bank notes, coins, checks, bonds, stamps, or securities.\n\nThe term obligate can also be used in a biological context, in reference to species which must occupy a certain niche or behave in a certain way in order to survive. In biology, the opposite of obligate is facultative, meaning that a species is able to behave in a certain way and may do so under certain circumstances, but that it can also survive without having to behave this way. For example, species of salamanders in the family Proteidae are obligate paedomorphs, whereas species belonging to the Ambystomatidae are facultative paedomorphs.\n\nIn the Catholic Church, Holy Days of Obligation or Holidays of Obligation, less commonly called Feasts of Precept, are the days on which, as canon 1247 of the Code of Canon Law states, the faithful are obliged to participate in the Mass.\n\n"}

The character made its first appearance in the last quarter of the 16th century, apparently as the invention of the actor with whom the role was to be long identified, Giovanni Pellesini. Contemporary illustrations suggest that his white blouse and trousers constituted \"a variant of the typical \"zanni\" suit\", and his Bergamasque dialect marked him as a member of the \"low\" rustic class. But if his costume and social station were without distinction, his dramatic role was certainly not: as a multifaceted \"first\" \"zanni\", his character was‚Äîand still is‚Äîrich in comic incongruities.\n\nMany Commedia historians make a connection between the Italian Pedrolino and the later Pierrot of the French Com√©die-Italienne, and, although a link between the two is possible, it remains unproven and seems unlikely, based on the scant evidence of early Italian scenario texts.\n\nPedrolino appears in forty-nine of the fifty scenarios of Flaminio Scala's \"Il teatro delle favole rappresentative\" (1611) and in three (undated) pieces of the \"Corsini\" collection of manuscripts; he also appears (as \"Pedrolin\") in a 1587 scripted comedy by Luigi Groto, \"La Alteria.\" All of these provide evidence of how he was conceived and played. He is obviously a type of what Robert Storey calls the \"social wit\", usually incarnated as \"the go-between, the willing servant, the wily slave\" who \"survives in serving others\". In the Scala scenarios, which offer the most revealing showcase of his character, he is invariably cast as the \"first\" \"zanni\", a type to be distinguished from the \"second\" \"zanni\" by his or her function in the plot. The Commedia critic and historian Constant Mic clarifies the distinctions when he notes that the first \"zanni\"\ninstigates confusion quite voluntarily, [but] the second creates disturbance through his blundering. The second \"zanni\" is a perfect dunce; but the first sometimes gives indication of a certain instruction. ... \"The first\" zanni \"incarnates the dynamic, comic element of the play, the second its static element\".\nSince his function is \"to keep the play moving\", Pedrolino seems to betray, in Storey's words, \"a Janus-faced aspect\": \"He may work cleverly in the interests of the Lovers in one play‚Äî\"Li Quattro finti spiritati\" [The Four Fake Spirits], for example‚Äîby disguising himself as a magician and making Pantalone believe that the 'madness' of Isabella and Oratio can be cured only by their coupling together; then, in \"Gli avvenimenti comici, pastorali e tragici\" [Comic, Pastoral, and Tragic Events], indulge his capricious sense of fun by compounding the young persons' misfortunes.\" So multiform is his character that his cleverness can often give way to credulity (as when he is tricked into believing that he was drunk when he learned of his wife's infidelity and so merely imagined the whole affair) and his calculation can sometimes be routed by grotesque sentimentality (as when he, Arlecchino, and Burratino share a bowl of macaroni, the three blubbering all the while). Despite such inconsistencies in character and behavior, he has (or at least had, for his Renaissance audiences) an \"instantly recognizable\" identity. \"The recognizability came,\" as Richard Andrews writes, \"from his costume; from his body language; and most of all from his style of speech, which for Italian audiences was based on a regional dialect as well as more personal idiosyncrasies.\" That recognizability also arose from his puckish love of mischief: \"He takes a child-like delight in practical jokes and pranks,\" as a modern-day practitioner of the Commedia writes, \"but otherwise his intrigues are on behalf of his master. ... At times, however, the best he can scheme for is to escape the punishment others have in store for him.\" Naively volatile, he can be moved to violence when angry, but, in obedience to the conventions of comedy, his pugnaciousness is usually deflected or foiled.\n\nPedrolino is most often presented as having an all-white wardrobe and wearing exaggeratedly over-sized and loose-fitting clothes, typically including a white jacket with large buttons and comically long sleeves, a large neck ruff, and a large, floppy hat. He is one of the few unmasked male characters that was not an Innamorati. Instead of a mask, Pedrolino is said to have been defined, according to some Commedia historians, by a white \"floured\" makeup, also known as \"infarinato\", which later inspired, in part, the makeup of the modern-day white-faced clown.\n\nPedrolino first appears among the records of the Commedia in 1576, when his interpreter Giovanni Pellesini (c. 1526-1616) turns up in Florence, apparently leading his own troupe called \"Pedrolino\". A member of some of the most illustrious companies of the 16th and 17th centuries‚Äîthe \"Confidenti\", \"Uniti\", \"Fideli\", \"Gelosi\", and \"Accessi\"‚ÄîPellesini was obviously \"a much sought-after and highly paid guest star\". His status is underscored by the fact that Pedrolino figures so prominently in Scala's scenarios, since, as K.M. Lea convincingly argues, Scala, in compiling them, drew upon the \"chief actors of his day ... without regard to the composition of a company at any particular period.\" Pedrolino‚Äîand Pellesini‚Äîwere, we must conclude, among the brightest luminaries of the early Commedia dell'Arte.\n\nPellesini had a lengthy run as Pedrolino and performed for a number of high-ranking spectators, including the Duke of Mantua at Fontainebleau while traveling with the \"Confidenti\". His last appearance as Pedrolino was in 1613 at the age of eighty-seven, performing with the \"Accessi\" company at the court theater of the Louvre, an engagement to which the poet Malherbe responded:\nHarlequin is certainly quite different from what he was, and so is Petrolin [i.e., Pedrolino]: the first is fifty-six and the second eighty-seven. These are no longer proper ages for the theater; gay spirits and sharp wits are needed there, and one hardly finds these in bodies as old as theirs.\n\nSince the names of the two types translate into the same diminutive (\"Little Pete\") and they enjoy (or suffer) the same dramatic and social status, as comic servants, in the Commedia, many authors have concluded that Pedrolino is either the \"Italian equivalent\" or the direct ancestor of the 17th-century French Pierrot. But there is no documentation from that century that establishes a clear connection between the two types. \"Dominique\" Biancolelli, Harlequin of the first Paris-based Italian troupe in which Pierrot appeared by name, contended that Pierrot was conceived as a Pulcinella, not a Pedrolino: \"The nature of the \"r√¥le\",\" he wrote, \nis that of a Neapolitan Pulcinella a little altered. In point of fact, the Neapolitan scenarii, in place of Arlecchino and Scapino, admit two Pulcinellas, the one an intriguing rogue and the other a stupid fool. The latter is Pierot's [sic] \"r√¥le\".\nA more direct source is the patois-spouting and lovelorn peasant Pierrot of Moli√®re's play \"Don Juan, or The Stone Guest\" (1665). Some eight years after its highly successful premiere, the Italians spoofed Moli√®re's comedy with an \"Addendum to \"The Stone Guest\"\", in which Pierrot first appeared by name among his fellow masks; he was played by one Giuseppe Giaratone, an actor who thereafter would be identified with the character for the next quarter-century. Like Moli√®re's, Giaratone's Pierrot would also prove to be lovelorn, subject to a malady that does not afflict Pedrolino. And, notwithstanding Giaratone's usually playing Pierrot as an Italianate \"zanni\", it is probably no accident that, in several of the plays left behind by his troupe, Pierrot is portrayed as a patois-spouting peasant in the French mold.\n\nPedrolino and Pierrot are clearly differentiated by their respective functions in the plots of their plays. Pedrolino, as a first \"zanni\", is, as Mic notes above, the \"dynamic\" element of the play; Pierrot, on the other hand, as a second \"zanni\", is static. The latter appears, as Storey writes, \"in comparative isolation from his fellow masks, with few exceptions, in all the plays of \"Le Th√©√¢tre Italien\", standing on the periphery of the action, commenting, advising, chiding, but rarely taking part in the movement around him.\" Pedrolino, by contrast, is not a character to be caught standing still.\n\n"}
{"id": "6880370", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6880370", "title": "Philosophy of language", "text": "Philosophy of language\n\nPhilosophy of language in the analytical tradition explored logic and accounts of the mind at the end of the nineteenth century, with English-speaking writers Frege and Russell being pivotal, followed by Wittgenstein (\"Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus\"), the Vienna Circle and the logical positivists, and Quine, while on the continent a foundation work was Ferdinand de Saussure's \"Cours de linguistique g√©n√©rale\", published posthumously in 1916. Philosophy of Language may investigate the relations between language, language users, and the world. The scope of Philosophy of Language may include inquiry into the origins of language, the nature of meaning, the usage and cognition of language. It overlaps to some extent with the study of Epistemology, Logic, Philosophy of Mind and other fields (including linguistics and psychology).\n\nIn a broader sense it may be said that the philosophy of language explores the relationship between language and reality. In particular, philosophy of language studies issues that cannot be addressed by other fields, like linguistics, or psychology. Major topics in the philosophy of language include the nature of meaning, intentionality, reference, the constitution of sentences, concepts, learning, and thought.\n\nThe topic that has received the most attention in the philosophy of language has been the \"nature\" of meaning, to explain what \"meaning\" is, and what we mean when we talk about meaning. Within this area, issues include: the nature of synonymy, the origins of meaning itself, our apprehension of meaning, and the nature of composition (the question of how meaningful units of language are composed of smaller meaningful parts, and how the meaning of the whole is derived from the meaning of its parts).\n\nSecondly, this field of study seeks to better understand what speakers and listeners do with language in communication, and how it is used socially. Specific interests include the topics of language learning, language creation, and speech acts.\n\nThirdly, the question of how language relates to the minds of both the speaker and the interpreter is investigated. Of specific interest is the grounds for successful translation of words and concepts into their equivalents in another language.\n\nFinally, philosophers of language investigate how language and meaning relate to truth and the reality being referred to. They tend to be less interested in which sentences are \"actually true\", and more in \"what kinds of meanings can be true or false\". A truth-oriented philosopher of language might wonder whether or not a meaningless sentence can be true or false, or whether or not sentences can express propositions about things that do not exist, rather than the way sentences are used.\n\nIt has long been known that there are different parts of speech. One part of the common sentence is the lexical word, which is composed of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. A major question in the field ‚Äì perhaps the single most important question for formalist and structuralist thinkers ‚Äì is, \"How does the meaning of a sentence emerge out of its parts?\"\n\nMany aspects of the problem of the composition of sentences are addressed in the field of linguistics of syntax. Philosophical semantics tends to focus on the principle of compositionality to explain the relationship between meaningful parts and whole sentences. The principle of compositionality asserts that a sentence can be understood on the basis of the meaning of the \"parts\" of the sentence (i.e., words, morphemes) along with an understanding of its \"structure\" (i.e., syntax, logic). Further, syntactic propositions are arranged into 'discourse' or 'narrative' structures, which also encode meanings through pragmatics like temporal relations and pronominals.\n\nIt is possible to use the concept of \"functions\" to describe more than just how lexical meanings work: they can also be used to describe the meaning of a sentence. Take, for a moment, the sentence \"The horse is red\". We may consider \"the horse\" to be the product of a \"propositional function\". A propositional function is an operation of language that takes an entity (in this case, the horse) as an input and outputs a \"semantic fact\" (i.e., the proposition that is represented by \"The horse is red\"). In other words, a propositional function is like an algorithm. The meaning of \"red\" in this case is whatever takes the entity \"the horse\" and turns it into the statement, \"The horse is red.\"\n\nLinguists have developed at least two general methods of understanding the relationship between the parts of a linguistic string and how it is put together: syntactic and semantic trees. Syntactic trees draw upon the words of a sentence with the \"grammar\" of the sentence in mind. Semantic trees, on the other hand, focus upon the role of the \"meaning\" of the words and how those meanings combine to provide insight onto the genesis of semantic facts.\n\nThere have been several distinctive explanations of what a linguistic \"meaning\" is. Each has been associated with its own body of literature.\n\n\nOther theories exist to discuss non-linguistic meaning (i.e., meaning as conveyed by body language, meanings as consequences, etc.).\n\nInvestigations into how language interacts with the world are called theories of reference. Gottlob Frege was an advocate of a mediated reference theory. Frege divided the semantic content of every expression, including sentences, into two components: sense and reference. The sense of a sentence is the thought that it expresses. Such a thought is abstract, universal and objective. The sense of any sub-sentential expression consists in its contribution to the thought that its embedding sentence expresses. Senses determine reference and are also the modes of presentation of the objects to which expressions refer. Referents are the objects in the world that words pick out. The senses of sentences are thoughts, while their referents are truth values (true or false). The referents of sentences embedded in propositional attitude ascriptions and other opaque contexts are their usual senses.\n\nBertrand Russell, in his later writings and for reasons related to his theory of acquaintance in epistemology, held that the only directly referential expressions are, what he called, \"logically proper names\". Logically proper names are such terms as \"I\", \"now\", \"here\" and other indexicals. He viewed proper names of the sort described above as \"abbreviated definite descriptions\". Hence \"Donald J. Trump\" may be an abbreviation for \"the current President of the United States and husband of Melania Trump.\" Definite descriptions are denoting phrases (see \"On Denoting\") which are analyzed by Russell into existentially quantified logical constructions. Such phrases denote in the sense that there is an object that satisfies the description. However, such objects are not to be considered meaningful on their own, but have meaning only in the proposition expressed by the sentences of which they are a part. Hence, they are not directly referential in the same way as logically proper names, for Russell.\n\nOn Frege's account, any referring expression has a sense as well as a referent. Such a \"mediated reference\" view has certain theoretical advantages over Mill's view. For example, co-referential names, such as \"Samuel Clemens\" and \"Mark Twain\", cause problems for a directly referential view because it is possible for someone to hear \"Mark Twain is Samuel Clemens\" and be surprised ‚Äì thus, their cognitive content seems different.\n\nDespite the differences between the views of Frege and Russell, they are generally lumped together as descriptivists about proper names. Such descriptivism was criticized in Saul Kripke's \"Naming and Necessity\".\n\nKripke put forth what has come to be known as \"the modal argument\" (or \"argument from rigidity\"). Consider the name \"Aristotle\" and the descriptions \"the greatest student of Plato\", \"the founder of logic\" and \"the teacher of Alexander\". Aristotle obviously satisfies all of the descriptions (and many of the others we commonly associate with him), but it is not necessarily true that if Aristotle existed then Aristotle was any one, or all, of these descriptions. Aristotle may well have existed without doing any single one of the things for which he is known to posterity. He may have existed and not have become known to posterity at all or he may have died in infancy. Suppose that Aristotle is associated by Mary with the description \"the last great philosopher of antiquity\" and (the actual) Aristotle died in infancy. Then Mary‚Äôs description would seem to refer to Plato. But this is deeply counterintuitive. Hence, names are \"rigid designators\", according to Kripke. That is, they refer to the same individual in every possible world in which that individual exists. In the same work, Kripke articulated several other arguments against \"Frege‚ÄìRussell\" descriptivism.\n\nIt is worth noting that the whole philosophical enterprise of studying reference has been critiqued by linguist Noam Chomsky in various works.\n\nSome of the major issues at the intersection of philosophy of language and philosophy of mind are also dealt with in modern psycholinguistics. Some important questions are \"How much of language is innate? Is language acquisition a special faculty in the mind? What is the connection between thought and language?\"\n\nThere are three general perspectives on the issue of language learning. The first is the behaviorist perspective, which dictates that not only is the solid bulk of language learned, but it is learned via conditioning. The second is the \"hypothesis testing perspective\", which understands the child's learning of syntactic rules and meanings to involve the postulation and testing of hypotheses, through the use of the general faculty of intelligence. The final candidate for explanation is the innatist perspective, which states that at least some of the syntactic settings are innate and hardwired, based on certain modules of the mind.\n\nThere are varying notions of the structure of the brain when it comes to language. Connectionist models emphasize the idea that a person's lexicon and their thoughts operate in a kind of distributed, associative network. Nativist models assert that there are specialized devices in the brain that are dedicated to language acquisition. Computation models emphasize the notion of a representational language of thought and the logic-like, computational processing that the mind performs over them. Emergentist models focus on the notion that natural faculties are a complex system that emerge from simpler biological parts. Reductionist models attempt to explain higher-level mental processes in terms of the basic low-level neurophysiological activity of the brain.\n\nAn important problem which touches both philosophy of language and philosophy of mind is to what extent language influences thought and vice versa. There have been a number of different perspectives on this issue, each offering a number of insights and suggestions.\n\nLinguists Sapir and Whorf suggested that language limited the extent to which members of a \"linguistic community\" can think about certain subjects (a hypothesis paralleled in George Orwell's novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\"). In other words, language was analytically prior to thought. Philosopher Michael Dummett is also a proponent of the \"language-first\" viewpoint.\n\nThe stark opposite to the Sapir‚ÄìWhorf position is the notion that thought (or, more broadly, mental content) has priority over language. The \"knowledge-first\" position can be found, for instance, in the work of Paul Grice. Further, this view is closely associated with Jerry Fodor and his language of thought hypothesis. According to his argument, spoken and written language derive their intentionality and meaning from an internal language encoded in the mind. The main argument in favor of such a view is that the structure of thoughts and the structure of language seem to share a compositional, systematic character. Another argument is that it is difficult to explain how signs and symbols on paper can represent anything meaningful unless some sort of meaning is infused into them by the contents of the mind. One of the main arguments against is that such levels of language can lead to an infinite regress. In any case, many philosophers of mind and language, such as Ruth Millikan, Fred Dretske and Fodor, have recently turned their attention to explaining the meanings of mental contents and states directly.\n\nAnother tradition of philosophers has attempted to show that language and thought are coextensive ‚Äì that there is no way of explaining one without the other. Donald Davidson, in his essay \"Thought and Talk\", argued that the notion of belief could only arise as a product of public linguistic interaction. Daniel Dennett holds a similar \"interpretationist\" view of propositional attitudes. To an extent, the theoretical underpinnings to cognitive semantics (including the notion of semantic framing) suggest the influence of language upon thought. However, the same tradition views meaning and grammar as a function of conceptualization, making it difficult to assess in any straightforward way.\n\nSome thinkers, like the ancient sophist Gorgias, have questioned whether or not language was capable of capturing thought at all.\nThere are studies that prove that languages shape how people understand causality. Some of them were performed by Lera Boroditsky. For example, English speakers tend to say things like \"John broke the vase\" even for accidents. However, Spanish or Japanese speakers would be more likely to say \"the vase broke itself.\" In studies conducted by Caitlin Fausey at Stanford University speakers of English, Spanish and Japanese watched videos of two people popping balloons, breaking eggs and spilling drinks either intentionally or accidentally. Later everyone was asked whether they could remember who did what. Spanish and Japanese speakers did not remember the agents of accidental events as well as did English speakers. \n\nRussian speakers, who make an extra distinction between light and dark blue in their language, are better able to visually discriminate shades of blue. The Piraha, a tribe in Brazil, whose language has only terms like few and many instead of numerals, are not able to keep track of exact quantities.\n\nIn one study German and Spanish speakers were asked to describe objects having opposite gender assignment in those two languages. The descriptions they gave differed in a way predicted by grammatical gender. For example, when asked to describe a \"key\"‚Äîa word that is masculine in German and feminine in Spanish‚Äîthe German speakers were more likely to use words like \"hard,\" \"heavy,\" \"jagged,\" \"metal,\" \"serrated,\" and \"useful,\" whereas Spanish speakers were more likely to say \"golden,\" \"intricate,\" \"little,\" \"lovely,\" \"shiny,\" and \"tiny.\" To describe a \"bridge,\" which is feminine in German and masculine in Spanish, the German speakers said \"beautiful,\" \"elegant,\" \"fragile,\" \"peaceful,\" \"pretty,\" and \"slender,\" and the Spanish speakers said \"big,\" \"dangerous,\" \"long,\" \"strong,\" \"sturdy,\" and \"towering.\" This was the case even though all testing was done in English, a language without grammatical gender.\n\nIn a series of studies conducted by Gary Lupyan, people were asked to look at a series of images of imaginary aliens. Whether each alien was friendly or hostile was determined by certain subtle features but participants were not told what these were. They had to guess whether each alien was friendly or hostile, and after each response they were told if they were correct or not, helping them learn the subtle cues that distinguished friend from foe. A quarter of the participants were told in advance that the friendly aliens were called \"leebish\" and the hostile ones \"grecious\", while another quarter were told the opposite. For the rest, the aliens remained nameless. It was found that participants who were given names for the aliens learned to categorize the aliens far more quickly, reaching 80 per cent accuracy in less than half the time taken by those not told the names. By the end of the test, those told the names could correctly categorize 88 per cent of aliens, compared to just 80 per cent for the rest. It was concluded that naming objects helps us categorize and memorize them.\n\nIn another series of experiments a group of people was asked to view furniture from an IKEA catalog. Half the time they were asked to label the object ‚Äì whether it was a chair or lamp, for example ‚Äì while the rest of the time they had to say whether or not they liked it. It was found that when asked to label items, people were later less likely to recall the specific details of products, such as whether a chair had arms or not. It was concluded that labeling objects helps our minds build a prototype of the typical object in the group at the expense of individual features.\n\nA common claim is that language is governed by social conventions. Questions inevitably arise on surrounding topics. One question is, \"What exactly is a convention, and how do we study it?\", and second, \"To what extent do conventions even matter in the study of language?\" David Kellogg Lewis proposed a worthy reply to the first question by expounding the view that a convention is a \"rationally self-perpetuating regularity in behavior\". However, this view seems to compete to some extent with the Gricean view of speaker's meaning, requiring either one (or both) to be weakened if both are to be taken as true.\n\nSome have questioned whether or not conventions are relevant to the study of meaning at all. Noam Chomsky proposed that the study of language could be done in terms of the I-Language, or internal language of persons. If this is so, then it undermines the pursuit of explanations in terms of conventions, and relegates such explanations to the domain of \"meta-semantics\". \"Metasemantics\" is a term used by philosopher of language Robert Stainton to describe all those fields that attempt to explain how semantic facts arise. One fruitful source of research involves investigation into the social conditions that give rise to, or are associated with, meanings and languages. \"Etymology\" (the study of the origins of words) and \"stylistics\" (philosophical argumentation over what makes \"good grammar\", relative to a particular language) are two other examples of fields that are taken to be meta-semantic.\n\nNot surprisingly, many separate (but related) fields have investigated the topic of linguistic convention within their own research paradigms. The presumptions that prop up each theoretical view are of interest to the philosopher of language. For instance, one of the major fields of sociology, symbolic interactionism, is based on the insight that human social organization is based almost entirely on the use of meanings. In consequence, any explanation of a social structure (like an institution) would need to account for the shared meanings which create and sustain the structure.\n\nRhetoric is the study of the particular words that people use to achieve the proper emotional and rational effect in the listener, be it to persuade, provoke, endear, or teach. Some relevant applications of the field include the examination of propaganda and didacticism, the examination of the purposes of swearing and pejoratives (especially how it influences the behavior of others, and defines relationships), or the effects of gendered language. It can also be used to study linguistic transparency (or speaking in an accessible manner), as well as performative utterances and the various tasks that language can perform (called \"speech acts\"). It also has applications to the study and interpretation of law, and helps give insight to the logical concept of the domain of discourse.\n\nLiterary theory is a discipline that some literary theorists claim overlaps with the philosophy of language. It emphasizes the methods that readers and critics use in understanding a text. This field, an outgrowth of the study of how to properly interpret messages, is unsurprisingly closely tied to the ancient discipline of hermeneutics.\n\nIn Continental philosophy, language is not studied as a separate discipline, as it is in analytic philosophy. Rather, it is an inextricable part of many other areas of thought, such as phenomenology, semiotics, hermeneutics, Heideggerean ontology, existentialism, structuralism, deconstruction and critical theory. The idea of language is often related to that of logic in its Greek sense as \"logos\", meaning discourse or dialectic. Language and concepts are also seen as having been formed by history and politics, or even by historical philosophy itself.\n\nThe field of hermeneutics, and the theory of interpretation in general, has played a significant role in 20th century Continental philosophy of language and ontology beginning with Martin Heidegger. Heidegger combines phenomenology with the hermeneutics of Wilhelm Dilthey. Heidegger believed language was one of the most important concepts for \"Dasein\". Heidegger believed that language today is worn out because of overuse of important words, and would be inadequate for in-depth study of Being (\"Sein\"). For example, \"Sein\" (\"being\"), the word itself, is saturated with multiple meanings. Thus, he invented new vocabulary and linguistic styles, based on Ancient Greek and Germanic etymological word relations, to disambiguate commonly used words. He avoided words like consciousness, ego, human, nature, etc. and instead talked holistically of Being-in-the-world, Dasein.\n\nWith such new concepts as \"Being-in-the-world\", Heidegger constructs his theory of language, centered on speech. He believed speech (talking, listening, silence) was the most essential and pure form of language. Heidegger claims writing is only a supplement to speech, because even a reader constructs or contributes one's own \"talk\" while reading. The most important feature of language is its \"projectivity\", the idea that language is prior to human speech. This means that when one is \"thrown\" into the world, his existence is characterized from the beginning by a certain pre-comprehension of the world. However, it is only after naming, or \"articulation of intelligibility\", can one have primary access to \"Dasein\" and \"Being-in-the-World\".\n\nHans-Georg Gadamer expanded on these ideas of Heidegger and proposed a complete hermeneutic ontology. In \"Truth and Method\", Gadamer describes language as \"the medium in which substantive understanding and agreement take place between two people.\" In addition, Gadamer claims that the world is linguistically constituted, and cannot exist apart from language. For example, monuments and statues cannot communicate without the aid of language. Gadamer also claims that every language constitutes a world-view, because the linguistic nature of the world frees each individual from an objective environment: \"... the fact that we have a world at all depends upon [language] and presents itself in it. The world as world exists for man as for no other creature in the world.\"\n\nPaul Ric≈ìur, on the other hand, proposed a hermeneutics which, reconnecting with the original Greek sense of the term, emphasized the discovery of hidden meanings in the equivocal terms (or \"symbols\") of ordinary language. Other philosophers who have worked in this tradition include Luigi Pareyson and Jacques Derrida.\n\nSemiotics is the study of the transmission, reception and meaning of signs and symbols in general. In this field, human language (both natural and artificial) is just one among many ways that humans (and other conscious beings) are able to communicate. It allows them to take advantage of and effectively manipulate the external world in order to create meaning for themselves and transmit this meaning to others. Every object, every person, every event, and every force communicates (or \"signifies\") continuously. The ringing of a telephone for example, \"is\" the telephone. The smoke that I see on the horizon is the sign that there is a fire. The smoke signifies. The things of the world, in this vision, seem to be \"labeled\" precisely for intelligent beings who only need to interpret them in the way that humans do. Everything has meaning. True communication, including the use of human language, however, requires someone (a \"sender\") who sends a \"message\", or \"text\", in some code to someone else (a \"receiver\"). Language is studied only insofar as it is one of these forms (the most sophisticated form) of communication. Some important figures in the history of semiotics, are Charles Sanders Peirce, Roland Barthes, and Roman Jakobson. In modern times, its best-known figures include Umberto Eco, A.J. Greimas, Louis Hjelmslev, and Tullio De Mauro. Investigations on signs in non-human communications are subject to biosemiotics, a field founded in the late 20th century by Thomas Sebeok and Thure von Uexk√ºll.\n\nOne issue that has troubled philosophers of language and logic is the problem of the vagueness of words. The specific instances of vagueness that most interest philosophers of language are those where the existence of \"borderline cases\" makes it seemingly impossible to say whether a predicate is true or false. Classic examples are \"is tall\" or \"is bald\", where it cannot be said that some borderline case (some given person) is tall or not-tall. In consequence, vagueness gives rise to the paradox of the heap. Many theorists have attempted to solve the paradox by way of \"n\"-valued logics, such as fuzzy logic, which have radically departed from classical two-valued logics.\n\nOne debate that has captured the interest of many philosophers is the debate over the meaning of \"universals\". One might ask, for example, \"When people say the word \"rocks\", what is it that the word represents?\" Two different answers have emerged to this question. Some have said that the expression stands for some real, abstract universal out in the world called \"rocks\". Others have said that the word stands for some collection of particular, individual rocks that we associate with merely a nomenclature. The former position has been called \"philosophical realism\", and the latter \"nominalism\".\n\nThe issue here can be explicated if we examine the proposition \"Socrates is a Man\".\n\nFrom the radical realist's perspective, the connection between S and M is a connection between two abstract entities. There is an entity, \"man\", and an entity, \"Socrates\". These two things connect in some way or overlap.\n\nFrom a nominalist's perspective, the connection between S and M is the connection between a particular entity (Socrates) and a vast collection of particular things (men). To say that Socrates is a man is to say that Socrates is a part of the class of \"men\". Another perspective is to consider \"man\" to be a \"property\" of the entity, \"Socrates\".\n\nThere is a third way, between nominalism and radical realism, usually called \"moderate realism\" and attributed to Aristotle and Thomas Aquinas. Moderate realists hold that \"man\" refers to a real essence or form that is really present and identical in Socrates and all other men, but \"man\" does not exist as a separate and distinct entity. This is a realist position, because \"Man\" is real, insofar as it really exists in all men; but it is a moderate realism, because \"Man\" is not an entity separate from the men it informs.\n\nMany philosophical discussions of language begin by clarifying terminology. One item which has undergone significant scrutiny is the idea of language itself. Those philosophers who have set themselves to the task ask two important questions: \"What is language in general?\" and \"What is a particular, individual language?\"\n\nSome semiotic outlooks have stressed that language is the mere manipulation and use of symbols in order to draw attention to signified content. If this were so, then humans would not be the sole possessors of language skills. On the other hand, many works by linguist Noam Chomsky have emphasized the role of syntax as a characteristic of any language.\n\nMore puzzling is the question of what it is that distinguishes one particular language from another. What is it that makes \"English\" English? What's the difference between Spanish and French? Chomsky has indicated that the search for what it means to be a language must begin with the study of the internal language of persons, or I-languages, which are based upon certain rules (or principles and parameters) which generate grammars. This view is supported in part by the conviction that there is no clear, general, and principled difference between one language and the next, and which may apply across the field of all languages. Other attempts, which he dubs \"E-languages,\" have tried to explain a language as usage within a specific speech community with a specific set of well-formed utterances in mind (markedly associated with linguists like Bloomfield).\n\nAnother of the questions that has divided philosophers of language is the extent to which formal logic can be used as an effective tool in the analysis and understanding of natural languages. While most philosophers, including Frege, Alfred Tarski and Rudolf Carnap, have been more or less skeptical about formalizing natural languages, many of them developed formal languages for use in the sciences or formalized \"parts\" of natural language for investigation. Some of the most prominent members of this tradition of formal semantics include Tarski, Carnap, Richard Montague and Donald Davidson.\n\nOn the other side of the divide, and especially prominent in the 1950s and 60s, were the so-called \"Ordinary language philosophers\". Philosophers such as P. F. Strawson, John Langshaw Austin and Gilbert Ryle stressed the importance of studying natural language without regard to the truth-conditions of sentences and the references of terms. They did not believe that the social and practical dimensions of linguistic meaning could be captured by any attempts at formalization using the tools of logic. Logic is one thing and language is something entirely different. What is important is not expressions themselves but what people use them to do in communication.\n\nHence, Austin developed a theory of speech acts, which described the kinds of things which can be done with a sentence (assertion, command, inquiry, exclamation) in different contexts of use on different occasions. Strawson argued that the truth-table semantics of the logical connectives (e.g., formula_1, formula_2 and formula_3) do not capture the meanings of their natural language counterparts (\"and\", \"or\" and \"if-then\"). While the \"ordinary language\" movement basically died out in the 1970s, its influence was crucial to the development of the fields of speech-act theory and the study of pragmatics. Many of its ideas have been absorbed by theorists such as Kent Bach, Robert Brandom, Paul Horwich and Stephen Neale. In recent work, the division between semantics and pragmatics has become a lively topic of discussion at the interface of philosophy and linguistics, for instance in work by Sperber and Wilson, Carston and Levinson.\n\nWhile keeping these traditions in mind, the question of whether or not there is any grounds for conflict between the formal and informal approaches is far from being decided. Some theorists, like Paul Grice, have been skeptical of any claims that there is a substantial conflict between logic and natural language.\n\nTranslation and interpretation are two other problems that philosophers of language have attempted to confront. In the 1950s, W.V. Quine argued for the indeterminacy of meaning and reference based on the principle of \"radical translation\". In \"Word and Object\", Quine asks readers to imagine a situation in which they are confronted with a previously undocumented, group of indigenous people where they must attempt to make sense of the utterances and gestures that its members make. This is the situation of radical translation.\n\nHe claimed that, in such a situation, it is impossible \"in principle\" to be absolutely certain of the meaning or reference that a speaker of the indigenous peoples language attaches to an utterance. For example, if a speaker sees a rabbit and says \"gavagai\", is she referring to the whole rabbit, to the rabbit's tail, or to a temporal part of the rabbit. All that can be done is to examine the utterance as a part of the overall linguistic behaviour of the individual, and then use these observations to interpret the meaning of all other utterances. From this basis, one can form a manual of translation. But, since reference is indeterminate, there will be many such manuals, no one of which is more correct than the others. For Quine, as for Wittgenstein and Austin, meaning is not something that is associated with a single word or sentence, but is rather something that, if it can be attributed at all, can only be attributed to a whole language. The resulting view is called \"semantic holism\".\n\nInspired by Quine's discussion, Donald Davidson extended the idea of radical translation to the interpretation of utterances and behavior within a single linguistic community. He dubbed this notion \"radical interpretation\". He suggested that the meaning that any individual ascribed to a sentence could only be determined by attributing meanings to many, perhaps all, of the individual's assertions, as well as their mental states and attitudes.\n\nLinguistic speculation in India is attested since the Vedic period (Iron Age), beginning with the deification of \"vƒÅk\" \"speech\" and the role of language (utterance, shabda) in ritual. Sanskrit grammatical tradition gives rise to linguistic philosophy beginning in the final centuries BC and early centuries AD, notably in the philosophical schools of Nyaya and Mimamsa.\n\nIn the West, inquiry into language stretches back to the 5th century BC with Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics. Both in India and in Greece, linguistic speculation predates the emergence of grammatical traditions of systematic description of language, which emerged around the 5th century BC in India (see YƒÅska), and around the 3rd century BC in Greece (see Rhianus).\n\nIn the dialogue \"Cratylus\", Plato considered the question of whether the names of things were determined by convention or by nature. He criticized conventionalism because it led to the bizarre consequence that anything can be conventionally denominated by any name. Hence, it cannot account for the correct or incorrect application of a name. He claimed that there was a natural correctness to names. To do this, he pointed out that compound words and phrases have a range of correctness. He also argued that primitive names had a natural correctness, because each phoneme represented basic ideas or sentiments. For example, for Plato the letter \"l\" and its sound represented the idea of softness. However, by the end of the \"Cronic\", he had admitted that some social conventions were also involved, and that there were faults in the idea that phonemes had individual meanings.\n\nAristotle interested himself with the issues of logic, categories, and meaning creation. He separated all things into categories of species and genus. He thought that the meaning of a predicate was established through an abstraction of the similarities between various individual things. This theory later came to be called \"nominalism\". However, since Aristotle took these similarities to be constituted by a real commonality of form, he is more often considered a proponent of \"moderate realism\".\n\nThe Stoic philosophers made important contributions to the analysis of grammar, distinguishing five parts of speech: nouns, verbs, appellatives (names or epithets), conjunctions and articles. They also developed a sophisticated doctrine of the \"lekt√≥n\" associated with each sign of a language, but distinct from both the sign itself and the thing to which it refers. This \"lekt√≥n\" was the meaning (or sense) of every term. The \"lekt√≥n\" of a sentence is what we would now call its proposition. Only propositions were considered \"truth-bearers\" or \"truth-vehicles\" (i.e., they could be called true or false) while sentences were simply their vehicles of expression. Different \"lekt√°\" could also express things besides propositions, such as commands, questions and exclamations.\n\nMedieval philosophers were greatly interested in the subtleties of language and its usage. For many scholastics, this interest was provoked by the necessity of translating Greek texts into Latin. There were several noteworthy philosophers of language in the medieval period. According to Peter J. King, (although this has been disputed), Peter Abelard anticipated the modern ideas of \"sense and reference\". Also, William of Ockham's \"Summa Logicae\" brought forward one of the first serious proposals for codifying a mental language.\n\nThe scholastics of the high medieval period, such as Ockham and John Duns Scotus, considered logic to be a \"scientia sermocinalis\" (science of language). The result of their studies was the elaboration of linguistic-philosophical notions whose complexity and subtlety has only recently come to be appreciated. Many of the most interesting problems of modern philosophy of language were anticipated by medieval thinkers. The phenomena of vagueness and ambiguity were analyzed intensely, and this led to an increasing interest in problems related to the use of \"syncategorematic\" words such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\", \"if\", and \"every\". The study of \"categorematic\" words (or \"terms\") and their properties was also developed greatly. One of the major developments of the scholastics in this area was the doctrine of the \"suppositio\". The suppositio of a term is the interpretation that is given of it in a specific context. It can be \"proper\" or \"improper\" (as when it is used in metaphor, metonyms and other figures of speech). A proper suppositio, in turn, can be either formal or material accordingly when it refers to its usual non-linguistic referent (as in \"Charles is a man\"), or to itself as a linguistic entity (as in \"\"Charles\" has seven letters\"). Such a classification scheme is the precursor of modern distinctions between use and mention, and between language and metalanguage.\n\nThere is a tradition called speculative grammar which existed from the 11th to the 13th century. Leading scholars included, among others, Martin of Dace and Thomas of Erfurth.\n\nLinguists of the Renaissance and Baroque periods such as Johannes Goropius Becanus, Athanasius Kircher and John Wilkins were infatuated with the idea of a philosophical language reversing the confusion of tongues, influenced by the gradual discovery of Chinese characters and Egyptian hieroglyphs (\"Hieroglyphica\"). This thought parallels the idea that there might be a universal language of music.\n\nEuropean scholarship began to absorb the Indian linguistic tradition only from the mid-18th century, pioneered by Jean Fran√ßois Pons and Henry Thomas Colebrooke (the \"editio princeps\" of VaradarƒÅja, a 17th-century Sanskrit grammarian, dating to 1849).\n\nIn the early 19th century, the Danish philosopher S√∏ren Kierkegaard insisted that language ought to play a larger role in Western philosophy. He argues that philosophy has not sufficiently focused on the role language plays in cognition and that future philosophy ought to proceed with a conscious focus on language:\n\nThe phrase \"linguistic turn\" was used to describe the noteworthy emphasis that contemporary philosophers put upon language.\n\nLanguage began to play a central role in Western philosophy in the early 20th century. One of the central figures involved in this development was the German philosopher Gottlob Frege, whose work on philosophical logic and the philosophy of language in the late 19th century influenced the work of 20-century analytic philosophers Bertrand Russell and Ludwig Wittgenstein. The philosophy of language became so pervasive that for a time, in analytic philosophy circles, philosophy as a whole was understood to be a matter of philosophy of language.\n\nIn Continental philosophy, the foundation work was Ferdinand de Saussure's \"Cours de linguistique g√©n√©rale\", published posthumously in 1916.\n\n\n"}

Beliefs and meanings held by individuals and groups are supported by, and embedded in, sociocultural institutions and processes.\n\nThe term was coined by Peter L. Berger, who says he draws his meaning of it from the ideas of Karl Marx, G. H. Mead, and Alfred Schutz. For Berger, the relation between plausibility structure and social \"world\" is dialectical, the one supporting the other which, in turn, can react back upon the first. Social arrangements may help, say, a certain religious world appear self-evident. This religious outlook may then help to shape the arrangements that contributed to its rise.\n\nBerger was particularly concerned with the loss of plausibility of the sacred in a modernist/postmodern world. Berger considered that history \"constructs and deconstructs plausibility structures\", and that the plurality of modern social worlds was \"an important cause of the diminishing plausibility of religious traditions.\"\n\nCritics have argued that Berger pays too much attention to discourse analysis and not enough to the institutional frameworks that continue to support religious belief.\n\nBerger may also underestimate the role of self-selected reference groups in maintaining one's plausibility structures, as well as the erosion of the modernist trend of secularization that took place with postmodernism.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "30431633", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=30431633", "title": "Political myth", "text": "Political myth\n\nA political myth is an ideological narrative that is believed by social groups.\n\nIn 1975, Henry Tudor defined it in the book \"Political Myth\". He said that myths are believed to be true even if they may be false, and they are devices with dramatic constructions used \"in order to come to grips with reality\". Political myths simply deal with political topics and always use a group of people as the hero or protagonist. In 2001, Christopher G. Flood described a working definition of a political myth as \"an ideologically marked narrative which purports to give a true account of a set of past, present, or predicted political events and which is accepted as valid in its essentials by a social group\".\n\nExamples cited as political myths include Manifest Destiny, The Clash of Civilizations, and national myths.\n\nIn 1946 Ernst Cassirer recounted political theory in his \"The Myth of the State\".\n\nIn 1973, T.L. Thorson wrote in the 4th edition of \"A History of Political Theory\": \"It is the mark of a modern mind to be able to explicitly create a 'myth' as a way of influencing others (as, for example, Plato does in \"The Republic\"). In it original sense myth is a literal description.\"\n\nAccording to Tudor, what recasts myth as political in nature is its subject matter, that being politics. In order for a political narrative to be recast as myth, the narrative of events must be cast in dramatic form and it must serve a practical argument.\n\nTudor defines \"dramatic form\", stating \"there is indeed a critical event by reference to which men can order their present experience but the events in question are thought of as taken place in the past.\" The function of political myth can be better understood when it is broken down into the following components: (1) myth provides the theoretical argument, which is incorporated into an (2) ideology that supports the myth by providing a practical argument.\n\nEvery myth has its protagonist/heroic figure that represents a particular community destined to create a morally coherent world which orients the community's activities towards this end. \nMythopoeic narratives in political discourse can range from origin stories (foundation myths) that recount the establishment of a community, to ascribing a political existence to a community based in the future (often a utopic vision), to restoring a political community that has ceased to exist. \n\nAlthough, both myth and ideology carry certain values and beliefs, ideology provides a practical argument rooted in rendering the community's past experiences as coherent, allowing them to make sense of their present circumstances and often, as a result, providing communities with objectives for future activities. A myth is considered a \"political myth\" when the narrative provides an ideologically marked account of the past, present, and future of the political community. By \"ideologically marked\", the narrative carries \"assumptions, values, and goals associated with a specific ideology‚Ä¶ that conveys an implicit invitation to assent to a particular ideological standpoint.\"\n\nIn short, political myths offer \"an account of the past and the future in the light of which the present can be understood.\" A political myth's success is dependent on the practical argument being accepted as true.\n\n\n"}

It draws in Lang's folklorist background for many tropes. \n\nA sequel was published in 1893, \"Prince Ricardo of Pantouflia: Being the Adventures of Prince Prigio's Son\". The two were issued in one 1895 volume as \"My Own Fairy Book: Namely, Certain Chronicles of Pantouflia, As Notably the Adventures of Prigio, Prince of That Country, and of His Son, Ricardo, with an Excerpt from the Annals of Scotland, As Touching Ker of Fairnilee, His Sojourn with the Queen of Faery\". All three books were published by J. W. Arrowsmith of Bristol. \"My Own Fairy Book\" appeared during the run of \"Coloured Fairy Books\" edited by Lang and published in London and New York by Longmans, Green, and Co. from 1890: \"The Blue Fairy Book\", \"The Red Fairy Book\", and so on. Longmans was also the US publisher of the Pantouflia books.\n\nThe two stories were also published together as \"The Chronicles of Pantouflia\" by Little, Brown and Company in 1942, with illustrations by Robert Lawson, and by David R. Godine in 1981. \n\nThe plot of \"Prince Prigio\" begins with the introduction of a queen who does not believe in fairies. After many childless years, she and the king finally had a boy, Prigio. When the queen refused to invite the fairies to the christening, none of the nobles would attend, and so the king and queen were alone when the fairies arrived and presented the child with gifts. Among the gifts were a never-empty purse (Fortunatus' purse), seven-league boots, a cap of darkness which would make him invisible, a wishing cap, a magic carpet, and also beauty, courage, and luck, but the last fairy decreed, \"My child, you shall be too clever!\"\n\nThis would have pleased the queen, but she did not believe it. She had all the items swept into a lumber room. \n\nThe prince grew up to be too clever. He would argue with everyone and knew better than everyone. He had two younger brothers, neither of whom was clever, and both of whom were liked; they fell in love with their cousins. The king particularly disliked Prigio, fearing he would claim the throne, and wanted to be rid of him. One day, a firedrake appeared in the country; the king was sorry that it would kill his second son as well as his first before the youngest son killed it, but he would sacrifice him to be rid of Prigio. Prigio, like his mother, refused to believe in its existence and reminded him that it was the youngest son who triumphed, so they should send him at once. \n\nAlphonse, his youngest brother, went and was eaten; Prigio, still not believing in firedrakes, thought he had gone off to travel. The king sent Enrico, the second, as well, and he also died. The king tried to send Prigio, who refused because he still disbelieved in the firedrake and also he was the last surviving heir. The king decided to take the rest of the court and abandon Prigio alone in the castle. When they did, Prigio found they also stole every piece of clothing except what he wore. He searched the castle and found the lumber room with the fairies' gifts. The seven-league boots bore him to an inn to eat, and he thought he dreamed it. No one paid any attention to him; he did not know that he was wearing an invisibility cap. He stole food, and when his cap was knocked off, paid from it from the purse -- which he found still full later. Whenever his cap came on or off, he appeared or vanished, but did not realize it. \n\nStill invisible, he went to a ball where everyone spoke badly of him except for one lady, who praised his aiding a poor student, and Prigio fell madly in love with her. At once, he believed in fairies and magic and realized everything that had happened to them. He used the things to make himself suitable for the ball and went and met the lady, the daughter of the English Ambassador, Lady Rosalind. When she spoke of the firedrake, he said he would kill it. He went back and found a magical spyglass, which he knew from Arabian Nights and spied out the dragon. He realized that even with his magical gifts, he had no chance, and his brothers had had none. He went to library to find a book by Cyrano de Bergerac about his trip to the moon. In it, he read of the Remora, which was as cold as the firedrake was hot; he resolved to find one and make the creatures fight. He found it using the spyglass, and went both creatures, taunting them in the other's name. The monsters met, fought, and killed each other. \n\nHe went back to the ambassador's house, and found that his father had issued a proclamation offering a reward for him, and another promising to make the Crown Prince, and marry to his niece, whoever brought the king the firedrake's horns and tail. He also found that his carpet had vanished, a servant having accidentally wished himself to the royal castle, with the firedrake's horns and tail.\n\nThen the carpet reappeared, with the servant, the king, and the queen, who refused to believe it. The king refused to be reconciled with Prigio. He tells how the servant claimed the reward, and when they disbelieved him, show them the carpet.\n\nDuring the night, the prince went back and cut off the firedrake's hooves. At court, the servant claimed that the proclamation had promised the reward to whoever brought the horns and tail, not the dragon-slayer. Prigio pointed out that if this was allowed, the king could not claim to say one thing and have meant another, which was a royal prerogative. The niece refused to choose between them. The king finally said that whoever brought its hooves would receive the reward. Prigio produced them at once. \n\nThe king insisted that he must marry his cousin, the promised niece, at once, or hang. Prigio prefers to hang, but suggested that if he recovered his brothers, the king could remit his sentence. The king agreed. Prigio went back to the castle where he had been abandoned, killed an old cat he found there, burned it, and restored it to life with the water from the Fountain of Lions -- being certain that the fairies would not have neglected it. Having thus tested it, he went to the firedrake's lair and restored his brothers; he then went to the remora's and restored the knights it had frozen. \n\nThe king was pleased to see his sons but would not restore Prigio to the Crown Princeship. Prigio pointed out he had the water and the firedrake's head, and the king agreed.\n\nAfter a triple wedding, Rosalind suggested to Prigio that he could use the wishing cap and make himself no cleverer than anyone else. Prigio agreed but thought better of it: he wished himself to no more clever than anyone else.\n\n"}

The Department of Oriental Languages and Literature was formed in response to this growing need. In 1937, an undergraduate program also began to take shape, beginning with courses in Chinese art and Far Eastern politics. World War II hindered the development of the Asian language curriculum until 1956 when Frederick W.

Marius Jansen was appointed as the head of the Japanese program. During this time, an experimental Korean program was offered, which included studies in language, history, and politics. However, this program proved unsuccessful, and another Korean program would not be instituted until 1993. In 1969, the Department of Oriental Studies received independent status and was renamed the East Asian Studies Department (the other component forming the Department of Near Eastern Studies).\n\nThe East Asian Studies Department cooperates with the Department of Art and Archaeology to offer a doctoral program in Chinese or Japanese art and archaeology.\n\nThe Korean program officially began offering courses in 1993.

{"id": "21244047", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21244047", "title": "Realism (arts)", "text": "Realism (arts)\n\nRealism, sometimes called naturalism, in the arts is generally the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding artistic conventions, or implausible, exotic, and supernatural elements. Realism has been prevalent in the arts at many periods, and can be in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization.\n\nIn the visual arts, illusionistic realism is the accurate depiction of lifeforms, perspective, and the details of light and colour. But realist or naturalist works of art may, as well or instead of illusionist realism, be \"realist\" in their subject-matter, and emphasize the mundane, ugly or sordid. This is typical of the 19th-century Realist movement that began in France in the 1850s, after the 1848 Revolution, and also social realism, regionalism, or kitchen sink realism. The Realist painters rejected Romanticism, which had come to dominate French literature and art, with roots in the late 18th century.\n\nThere have been various movements invoking realism in the other arts, such as the opera style of verismo, literary realism, theatrical realism, and Italian neorealist cinema. \n\nRealism is the precise, detailed and accurate representation in art of the visual appearance of scenes and objects i.e., it is drawn in photographic precision. Realism in this sense is also called naturalism, mimesis or illusionism. Realistic art was created in many periods, and it is in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization. It becomes especially marked in European painting in the Early Netherlandish painting of Robert Campin, Jan van Eyck and other artists in the 15th century. However such \"realism\" is often used to depict, for example, angels with wings, which were not things the artists had ever seen in real life. Equally, 19th-century Realism art movement painters such as Gustave Courbet are by no means especially noted for precise and careful depiction of visual appearances; in Courbet's time that was more often a characteristic of academic painting, which very often depicted with great skill and care scenes that were contrived and artificial, or imagined historical scenes. It is the choice and treatment of subject matter that defines Realism as a movement in painting, rather than the careful attention to visual appearances. Other terms such as naturalism, naturalistic and \"veristic\" do not escape the same ambiguity, though the distinction between \"realistic\" (usually related to visual appearance) and \"realist\" is often useful, as is the term \"illusionistic\" for the accurate rendering of visual appearances.\n\nThe development of increasingly accurate representation of the visual appearances of things has a long history in art. It includes elements such as the accurate depiction of the anatomy of humans and animals, of perspective and effects of distance, and of detailed effects of light and colour. The Art of the Upper Paleolithic in Europe achieved remarkably lifelike depictions of animals, and Ancient Egyptian art developed conventions involving both stylization and idealization that nevertheless allowed very effective depictions to be produced very widely and consistently. Ancient Greek art is commonly recognised as having made great progress in the representation of anatomy, and has remained an influential model ever since. No original works on panels or walls by the great Greek painters survive, but from literary accounts, and the surviving corpus of derivative works (mostly Graeco-Roman works in mosaic) it is clear that illusionism was highly valued in painting. Pliny the Elder's famous story of birds pecking at grapes painted by Zeuxis in the 5th century BC may well be a legend, but indicates the aspiration of Greek painting. As well as accuracy in shape, light and colour, Roman paintings show an unscientific but effective knowledge of representing distant objects smaller than closer ones, and representing regular geometric forms such as the roof and walls of a room with perspective. This progress in illusionistic effects in no way meant a rejection of idealism; statues of Greek gods and heroes attempt to represent with accuracy idealized and beautiful forms, though other works, such as heads of the famously ugly Socrates, were allowed to fall below these ideal standards of beauty. Roman portraiture, when not under too much Greek influence, shows a greater commitment to a truthful depiction of its subjects.\nThe art of Late Antiquity famously rejected illusionism for expressive force, a change already well underway by the time Christianity began to affect the art of the elite. In the West classical standards of illusionism did not begin to be reached again until the Late medieval and Early Renaissance periods, and were helped, first in the Netherlands in the early 15th century, and around the 1470s in Italy, by the development of new techniques of oil painting which allowed very subtle and precise effects of light to be painted using very small brushes and several layers of paint and glaze. Scientific methods of representing perspective were developed in Italy in the early 15th century and gradually spread across Europe, and accuracy in anatomy rediscovered under the influence of classical art. As in classical times, idealism remained the norm.\n\nThe accurate depiction of landscape in painting had also been developing in Early Netherlandish/Early Northern Renaissance and Italian Renaissance painting, and was then brought to a very high level in 17th-century Dutch Golden Age painting, with very subtle techniques for depicting a range of weather conditions and degrees of natural light. After being another development of Early Netherlandish painting, by 1600 European portraiture could give a very good likeness in both painting and sculpture, though the subjects were often idealized by smoothing features or giving them an artificial pose. Still life paintings, and still life elements in other works, played a considerable role in developing illusionistic painting, though in the Netherlandish tradition of flower painting they long lacked \"realism\", in that flowers from all seasons were typically used, either from the habit of assembling compositions from individual drawings, or as a deliberate convention; the large displays of bouquets in vases, though close to modern displays of cut flowers that they have influenced, were entirely atypical of 17th-century habits, where flowers were displayed one at a time. Intriguingly, having led the development of illusionic painting, still life was to be equally significant in its abandonment in Cubism.\n\nThe depiction of ordinary, everyday subjects in art also has a long history, though it was often squeezed into the edges of compositions, or shown at a smaller scale. This was partly because art was expensive, and usually commissioned for specific religious, political or personal reasons, that allowed only a relatively small amount of space or effort to be devoted to such scenes. Drolleries in the margins of medieval illuminated manuscripts sometimes contain small scenes of everyday life, and the development of perspective created large background areas in many scenes set outdoors that could be made more interesting by including small figures going about their everyday lives. Medieval and Early Renaissance art by convention usually showed non-sacred figures in contemporary dress, so no adjustment was needed for this even in religious or historical scenes set in ancient times.\n\nEarly Netherlandish painting brought the painting of portraits as low down the social scale as the prosperous merchants of Flanders, and in some of these, notably the \"Arnolfini Portrait\" by Jan van Eyck (1434), and more often in religious scenes such as the Merode Altarpiece, by Robert Campin and his workshop (circa 1427), include very detailed depictions of middle-class interiors full of lovingly depicted objects. However these objects are at least largely there because they carry layers of complex significance and symbolism that undercut any commitment to realism for its own sake. Cycles of the Labours of the Months in late medieval art, of which many examples survive from books of hours, concentrate on peasants labouring on different tasks through the seasons, often in a rich landscape background, and were significant both in developing landscape art and the depiction of everyday working-class people.\nIn the 16th century there was a fashion for the depiction in large paintings of scenes of people working, especially in food markets and kitchens: in many the food is given as much prominence as the workers. Artists included Pieter Aertsen and his nephew Joachim Beuckelaer in the Netherlands, working in an essentially Mannerist style, and in Italy the young Annibale Carracci in the 1580s, using a very down to earth unpolished style, with Bartolomeo Passerotti somewhere between the two. Pieter Bruegel the Elder pioneered large panoramic scenes of peasant life. Such scenes acted as a prelude for the popularity of scenes of work in genre painting in the 17th century, which appeared all over Europe, with Dutch Golden Age painting sprouting several different subgenres of such scenes, the Bamboccianti (though mostly from the Low Countries) in Italy, and in Spain the genre of bodegones, and the introduction of unidealized peasants into history paintings by Jusepe de Ribera and Vel√°zquez. The Le Nain brothers in France and many Flemish artists including Adriaen Brouwer and David Teniers the Elder and Younger painted peasants, but rarely townsfolk. In the 18th century small paintings of working people working remained popular, mostly drawing on the Dutch tradition, and especially featuring women.\n\nMuch art depicting ordinary people, especially in the form of prints, was comic and moralistic, but the mere poverty of the subjects seems relatively rarely have been part of the moral message. From the mid-19th century onwards this changed, and the difficulties of life for the poor were emphasized. Despite this trend coinciding with large-scale migration from the countryside to cities in most of Europe, painters still tended to paint poor rural people, largely leaving illustrators such as Gustave Dor√© to show the horrors of city slums. Crowded city street scenes were popular with the Impressionists and related painters, especially ones showing Paris.\n\nMedieval manuscript illuminators were often asked to illustrate technology, but after the Renaissance such images continued in book illustration and prints, but with the exception of marine painting largely disappeared in fine art until the early Industrial Revolution, scenes from which were painted by a few painters such as Joseph Wright of Derby and Philip James de Loutherbourg. Such subjects probably failed to sell very well, and there is a noticeable absence of industry, other than a few railway scenes, in painting until the later 19th century, when works began to be commissioned, typically by industrialists or for institutions in industrial cities, often on a large scale, and sometimes given a quasi-heroic treatment.\n\nAmerican realism, a movement of the early 20th century, is one of many modern movements to use realism in this sense.\n\nThe Realist movement began in the mid-19th century as a reaction to Romanticism and History painting. In favor of depictions of 'real' life, the Realist painters used common laborers, and ordinary people in ordinary surroundings engaged in real activities as subjects for their works. Its chief exponents were Gustave Courbet, Jean-Fran√ßois Millet, Honor√© Daumier, and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. According to Ross Finocchio, formerly of the Department of European Paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Realists used unprettified detail depicting the existence of ordinary contemporary life, coinciding in the contemporaneous naturalist literature of √âmile Zola, Honor√© de Balzac, and Gustave Flaubert.\n\nThe French Realist movement had equivalents in all other Western countries, developing somewhat later. In particular the Peredvizhniki or \"Wanderers\" group in Russia who formed in the 1860s and organized exhibitions from 1871 included many realists such as Ilya Repin, Vasily Perov, and Ivan Shishkin, and had a great influence on Russian art. In Britain artists such as Hubert von Herkomer and Luke Fildes had great success with realist paintings dealing with social issues.\n\nRealism or naturalism as a style meaning the honest, unidealizing depiction of the subject, can be used in depicting any type of subject, without any commitment to treating the typical or everyday. Despite the general idealism of classical art, this too had classical precedents, which came in useful when defending such treatments in the Renaissance and Baroque. Demetrius of Alopece was a 4th-century BCE sculptor whose work (all now lost) was said to prefer realism over ideal beauty, and during the Ancient Roman Republic even politicians preferred a truthful depiction in portraits, though the early emperors favoured Greek idealism. Goya's portraits of the Spanish royal family represent a sort of peak in the honest and downright unflattering portrayal of important persons.\nA recurring trend in Christian art was \"realism\" that emphasized the humanity of religious figures, above all Christ and his physical sufferings in his Passion. Following trends in devotional literature, this developed in the Late Middle Ages, where some painted wooden sculptures in particular strayed into the grotesque in portraying Christ covered in wounds and blood, with the intention of stimulating the viewer to meditate on the suffering that Christ had undergone on his behalf. These were especially found in Germany and Central Europe. After abating in the Renaissance, similar works re-appeared in the Baroque, especially in Spanish sculpture.\n\nRenaissance theorists opened a debate, which was to last several centuries, as to the correct balance between drawing art from the observation of nature and from idealized forms, typically those found in classical models, or the work of other artists generally. All admitted the importance of the natural, but many believed it should be idealized to various degrees to include only the beautiful. Leonardo da Vinci was one who championed the pure study of nature, and wished to depict the whole range of individual varieties of forms in the human figure and other things. Leon Battista Alberti was an early idealizer, stressing the typical, with others such as Michelangelo supporting selection of the most beautiful ‚Äì he refused to make portraits for that reason.\nIn the 17th century the debate continued, in Italy usually centred on the contrast between the relative \"classical-idealism\" of the Carracci and the \"naturalist\" style of the Caravaggisti, or followers of Caravaggio, who painted religious scenes as though set in the back streets of contemporary Italian cities, and used \"naturalist\" as a self-description. Bellori, writing some decades after Caravaggio's early death, and no supporter of his style, refers to \"Those who glory in the name of naturalists\" (\"naturalisti\").\n\nIn the 19th century \"Naturalism\" or the \"Naturalist school\" was somewhat artificially erected as a term representing a breakaway sub-movement of Realism, that attempted (not wholly successfully) to distinguish itself from its parent by its avoidance of politics and social issues, and liked to proclaim a quasi-scientific basis, playing on the sense of \"naturalist\" as a student of Natural history, as the biological sciences were then generally known. The originator of the term was the French art critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary, who in 1863 announced that: \"The naturalist school declares that art is the expression of life under all phases and on all levels, and that its sole aim is to reproduce nature by carrying it to its maximum power and intensity: it is truth balanced with science\". √âmile Zola adopted the term with a similar scientific emphasis for his aims in the novel. Much Naturalist painting covered a similar range of subject matter as that of Impressionism, but using tighter, more traditional brushwork styles, and in landscapes often with more gloomy weather.\n\nThe term \"continued to be used indiscriminately for various kinds of realism\" for several decades, often as a catch-all term for art that was outside Impressionism and later movements of Modernism and also was not Academic art. The later periods of the French Barbizon School and the D√ºsseldorf school of painting, with its students from many countries, and in 20th-century American Regionalism are movements which are often also described as \"Naturalist\", although the term is rarely used of British painting. Some recent art historians have deepened the confusion by claiming either Courbet or the Impressionists for the label.\n\nBroadly defined as \"the faithful representation of reality\", Realism as a literary movement was based on \"objective reality.\" It focused on showing everyday activities and life, primarily among the middle or lower class society, without romantic idealization or dramatization. It may be regarded as the general attempt to depict subjects as they are considered to exist in third person objective reality, without embellishment or interpretation and \"in accordance with secular, empirical rules.\" As such, the approach inherently implies a belief that such reality is ontologically independent of human kind's conceptual schemes, linguistic practices and beliefs, and thus can be known (or knowable) to the artist, who can in turn represent this 'reality' faithfully. As Ian Watt states, modern realism \"begins from the position that truth can be discovered by the individual through the senses\" and as such \"it has its origins in Descartes and Locke, and received its first full formulation by Thomas Reid in the middle of the eighteenth century.\"\n\nWhile the preceding Romantic era was also a reaction against the values of the Industrial Revolution, realism was in its turn a reaction to romanticism, and for this reason it is also commonly derogatorily referred as \"traditional\" \"bourgeois realism\". Some writers of Victorian literature produced works of realism. The rigidities, conventions, and other limitations of \"bourgeois realism,\" prompted in their turn the revolt later labeled as modernism; starting around 1900, the driving motive of modernist literature was the criticism of the 19th-century bourgeois social order and world view, which was countered with an antirationalist, antirealist and antibourgeois program.\n\nTheatrical realism is said to have first emerged in European drama in the 19th century as an offshoot of the Industrial Revolution and the age of science. Some also specifically cited the invention of photography as the basis of the realist theater while others view that the association between realism and drama is far older as demonstrated by the principles of dramatic forms such as the presentation of the physical world that closely matches reality.\n\nThe achievement of realism in the theatre was to direct attention to the social and psychological problems of ordinary life. In its dramas, people emerge as victims of forces larger than themselves, as individuals confronted with a rapidly accelerating world. These pioneering playwrights were unafraid to present their characters as ordinary, impotent, and unable to arrive at answers to their predicaments. This type of art represents what we see with our human eyes. Anton Chekov, for instance, used camera works to reproduce an uninflected slice of life, exposing the rhetorical and suasive character of realistic theatricality. Scholars such as Thomas Postlewait noted that throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, there were numerous joinings of melodramatic and realistic forms and functions, which could be demonstrated in the way melodramatic elements existed in realistic forms and vice versa.\n\nIn the United States, realism in drama preceded fictional realism by about two decades as theater historians identified the first impetus toward realism during the late 1870s and early 1880s. Its development is also attributed to William Dean Howells and Henry James who served as the spokesmen for realism as well as articulator of its aesthetic principles.\n\nThe realistic approach to theater collapsed into nihilism and the absurd after World War II. \n\nItalian Neorealism was a cinematic movement incorporating elements of realism that developed in post-WWII Italy. Notable Neorealists included Vittorio De Sica, Luchino Visconti, and Roberto Rossellini. Realist films generally focus on social issues. There are two types of realism in film: seamless realism and aesthetic realism. Seamless realism tries to use narrative structures and film techniques to create a \"reality effect\" to maintain its authenticity. Aesthetic realism, which was first called for by French filmmakers in the 1930s and promoted by Andre Bazin in the 1950s, acknowledges that a \"film cannot be fixed to mean what it shows\", as there are multiple realisms; as such, these filmmakers use location shooting, natural light and non-professional actors to ensure the viewer can make up her/his own choice based on the film, rather than being manipulated into a \"preferred reading\". Siegfried Kracauer is also notable for arguing that realism is the most important function of cinema.\n\nAesthetic realist filmmakers use long shots, deep focus and eye-level 90 degree shots to reduce manipulation of what the viewer sees. Italian neorealism filmmakers from after WWII took the existing realist film approaches from France and Italy that emerged in the 1960s and used the to create a politically-oriented cinema. French filmmakers made some politically-oriented realist films in the 1960s, such as the cin√©ma v√©rit√© and documentary films of Jean Rouch. In the 1950s and 1960s, British, French and German new waves of filmmaking produced \"slice-of-life\" films (e.g., kitchen sink dramas in the UK).\n\nVerismo was a post-Romantic operatic tradition associated with Italian composers such as Pietro Mascagni, Ruggero Leoncavallo, Umberto Giordano, Francesco Cilea and Giacomo Puccini. They sought to bring the naturalism of influential late 19th-century writers such as √âmile Zola, Gustave Flaubert, and Henrik Ibsen into opera. This new style presented true-to-life drama that featured gritty and flawed lower-class protagonists while some described it as a heightened portrayal of a realistic event. Although an account considered Giuseppe Verdi's \"Luisa Miller\" and \"La Traviata\" as the first stirrings of the verismo, some claimed that it began in 1890 with the first performance of Mascagni's \"Cavalleria rusticana\", peaked in the early 1900s. It was followed by Leoncavallo's Pagliacci, which dealt with the themes of infidelity, revenge, and violence.\n\nVerismo also reached Britain where pioneers included the Victorian-era theatrical partnership of the dramatist W. S. Gilbert and the composer Arthur Sullivan (1842‚Äì1900). Specifically, their play \"Iolanthe\" is considered a realistic representation of the nobility although it included fantastical elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n"}
{"id": "993216", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=993216", "title": "Revenge tragedy", "text": "Revenge tragedy\n\nRevenge tragedy (sometimes referred to as revenge drama, revenge play, or tragedy of blood) is a theoretical genre in which the principal theme is revenge and revenge's fatal consequences. Formally established by American educator Ashley H. Thorndike in his 1902 article \"The Relations of Hamlet to Contemporary Revenge Plays,\" a revenge tragedy documents the progress of the protagonist's revenge plot and often leads to the demise of both the murderers and the avenger himself.\n\nThe genre first appeared in Early modern Britain with the publication of Thomas Kyd's \"The Spanish Tragedy\" during the latter half of the 16th century\".\" Earlier works, such as Jasper Heywood's translations of Seneca (1560's) and Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville's play \"Gorbuduc\" (1561), are also considered revenge tragedies. Other well-known revenge tragedies include William Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" (c.1599-1602), \"Titus Andronicus\" (c.1588-1593), and Thomas Middleton's \"The Revenger's Tragedy\" (c.1606).\n\nThe genre of revenge tragedy is a modern invention, developed as a means of explaining early modern tragedies that maintain a theme or motif of revenge in varying degrees. Classification of the revenge tragedy is at times contentious, as with other early modern theatrical genres. Lawrence Danson suggested that Shakespeare and his contemporaries had a \"healthy ability to live comfortably with the unruliness of a theatre where the genre was not static but moving and mixing, always producing new possibilities.\" On the contrary, Shakespeare's 1623 First Folio's famously depicts the printer-imposed (William Jaggard and Edward Blount) three genres of comedy, history, and tragedy, leading readers to falsely believe that plays are easily categorized and contained. While these three genres have remained staples in discussions of genre, other genres are often either invoked or created to accommodate the generic slipperiness of early modern drama. These include not only revenge tragedy, but also city comedy, romance, pastoral, and problem play, among others.\n\nIt is common to consider any tragedy containing an element of revenge a revenge tragedy. Lily Campbell argues that revenge is the great thematic uniter of all early modern tragedy, and \"all Elizabethan tragedy must appear as fundamentally a tragedy of revenge if the extent of the idea of revenge be but grasped.\" Fredson Bowers's work (1959) on the genre not only widened and complicated what revenge tragedy is, but also increased its function as a productive lens in the work of dramatic interpretation. For example, \"Titus Andronicus\" was originally marketed in the First Folio as \"The Lamentable Tragedy of Titus Andronicus.\" \"Hamlet\" was similarly titled in the First Folio as \"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark\" and \"The Tragical History of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark\" in the Second Quarto edition (1604). It's not unusual to find present-day editors classifying these plays as tragedies; however, it is becoming increasingly common to also read and interpret early modern drama with other genres in mind, such as revenge tragedy.\n\nWhile these conventions don't apply to all plays that can be considered revenge tragedies, the events listed are common within the genre:\n\nLucius Seneca was a prominent playwright of the first century, famous for helping shape the genre of revenge tragedy with his ten plays: \"Hercules Furens, Troades, Phoenissae, Medea, Phaedra, Oedipus, Agamemnon, Thyestes, Hercules Oetaeus, and Octavia.\" The importance of his plays lies in the difficulty of the period. While the Elizabethan tragedy was considered more acceptable, revenge tragedy sought to unleash the carnal side of human nature on stage in a much more grotesque way. It was a transitional time in the literary world that would eventually lead to grueling pieces like these. Infamous scenes like the cannibalistic feast in \"Thyestes\" introduce the audience to another dimension of the human experience, challenging them to reflect on extreme emotions and dig deeper into the conventions of the genre.\n\nSeneca‚Äôs \"Thyestes\", a tale of revenge and horror with prominent cannibalism, can be identified as one of the first \"revenge pieces.\" In the power struggle between two brothers, Atreus and Thyestes, there is a clear theme of revenge. The underlying plot is Thyestes's affair with Atreus' wife. He stole his treasured golden fleece, and sneakily took the throne of Mycenae from him. After a long period of exile, Thyestes is allowed to return to Mycenae. However, the conflict escalates when Atreus executes his revenge by tricking Thyestes into eating his children. Although overtly grotesque, this piece of literature follows the conventions of the revenge tragedy genre. Ultimately, everyone ends up dead and revenge has been taken to a level that was not anticipated in the beginning.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare was an English poet and playwright from the 16th century. Through plays like \"Hamlet\" and \"Titus Andronicus\", Shakespeare portrayed the basic characteristics of a revenge tragedy. He presented elements that are quite similar to those from Seneca's tragedies, establishing tragedy as a more well-known genre.\n\n\"Titus Andronicus\" depicts the madness of Titus, who wanted to take revenge on Tamora and her sons for what they did to Lavinia and Bassianus. This leads him to kill everybody that he faced in his search to satisfy himself and avenge them. The main plot focuses on Titus's revenge against Tamora and her sons, but also there are other people to whom he seeks vengeance. This is an element that can define a revenge tragedy. The appearance of cannibalism in the last scene at the banquet and grotesque elements during the play relate \"Titus Andronicus\" to Seneca's earlier revenge tragedies.\n"}

It was later adapted into a computer-animated film of the same name by John A. Davis, produced by Legendary Pictures and DNA Productions for Warner Bros. Pictures.\n\nLucas is a boy who is perceived as \"strange\" by his peers due to his funny glasses and propeller beanie (hat). Sid, the neighborhood bully, continuously bullies Lucas by spraying him with a water hose and stealing his hat. In an attempt to cope with Sid's actions, Lucas projects his anger onto a local colony of ants by spraying them with water, just as Sid has done to him.\n\nThe ants have enough and tackle and shove Lucas into the queen's chamber, and the queen confronts him about all of the trouble he has caused the colony. When Lucas is too shocked to even respond to her, the queen takes it as an insult, and orders an ant wizard to shrink the boy down to the size of an ant and take him to trial, where the judge declares him guilty. His punishment is to work hard like an ant, working in the field, gathering food, defending the colony from wasps and spiders, and taking care of the queen, the worst part of his punishment.\n\nAfter a while, the queen tells Lucas that he has one last test to be set free: he must go home and bring her a Red Sweet Rock (jelly bean).

In November 1992, under pressure from his wife, Whitacre confesses to an FBI agent that he, along with other ADM executives, routinely met with competitors to fix the price of lysine, a food additive. Afterwards, Whitacre assists in gathering evidence against the other conspirators by secretly taping their activities during overseas business meetings. Over the course of three years, the FBI collects hundreds of hours of video and audio tapes documenting the largest case of price-fixing in history.\n\nWhitacre is revealed to have defrauded $9 million from ADM at the same time he was aiding the FBI. After federal agents stage raid on ADM, the company hits back with damning evidence against the government's star witness. Whitacre becomes delusional and engages in pathological lying to save himself, leading the FBI to learn that he suffers from bipolar disorder.

It depicts South African President Jacob Zuma in a pose reminiscent of Lenin, with his genitals exposed. The painting triggered a defamation lawsuit by Zuma's party, the African National Congress (ANC), and was vandalised on 22 May 2012.\n\nPrior to its being vandalised, \"The Spear\" was shown at the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg, South Africa. The painting featured as one of the pieces of artist Brett Murray's \"Hail to the Thief II\" exhibition, which commenced on 10 May 2012. Inspiration is understood to have been drawn from the Viktor Semyonovich Ivanov's poster \"Lenin Lived, Lenin is Alive, Lenin Will Live\". The exhibition features various pieces that are critical of South Africa's ruling party, the ANC, showcasing sculptures and images that suggest corruption and bad governance. Murray's works in the exhibition also include modifying ANC liberation struggle posters and flyers from the Apartheid era, some displaying the text \"Amandla, we demand Chivas, BMWs and bribes\".\n\nZuma has often been the centre of scandal and ridicule, due to his polygamous lifestyle with many wives and girlfriends, and a comment he made during his 2006 rape trial that showering after sex would minimise the risk of contracting HIV. His lifestyle has made him the target of well-known cartoonist Zapiro, who frequently depicts Zuma with a shower on his head, ridiculing the statements he made during his trial. Zapiro was also sued for defamation by the ANC, with a hearing expected in October 2012. These public perceptions of Zuma provided part of the basis for Brett Murray's painting.\n\nZapiro added fuel to the fire by doing his own version of the painting, replacing the genitals with a showerhead. Another appeared two days later, ridiculing Zuma.\n\nOwner and director of the Goodman Gallery, Liza Essers, said that she received a telephone call on Sunday, 13 May 2012 from special advisor to the minister of arts and culture Mduduzi Mbata seeking to clarify her thoughts on the exhibition, after it had been reviewed in the newspaper \"City Press\", along with a photograph of \"The Spear\". During the brief conversation she invited him to visit the gallery the following Tuesday, but he never kept the appointment. \n\nThe ANC issued a press release on 17 May 2012 expressing outrage about the painting and their intention to apply to the High Court to have it removed, this being reiterated by attorneys representing the ANC and Jacob Zuma in an email sent to Essers the same day. The painting drew strong condemnation from ANC rulers and various religious groups, who found the painting 'obscene' and 'vulgar'. A leader of the Nazareth Baptist Church called for the artist to be stoned to death. The ANC also demanded that the image be taken down from the \"City Press\"' website. ANC spokesperson Jackson Mthembu said of the painting, \"The African National Congress is extremely disturbed and outraged by the distasteful and indecent manner in which Brett Murray and the Goodman Gallery in Johannesburg is displaying the person of comrade President Jacob Zuma\". Zuma responded to the artwork by saying that it painted him as \"a philanderer and a womaniser\". \n\nIn response to the impending legal action, gallery spokesperson Lara Koseff said its lawyers had responded that it would stay until the show was over, citing censorship concerns as central to the decision to allow the exhibition to continue. The ANC Women's League has also demanded that the exhibition be halted, and all instances of the image be removed from the internet. Brett Murray said that his painting had not been intended maliciously, but as \"an attempt at humorous satire of political power and patriarchy within the context of other artworks in the exhibition and within the broader context of South African discourse\".\n\nIn the first day of legal proceedings, the representative for the ANC, Gcina Malindi, began sobbing and was unable to proceed, causing the process to be adjorned and postponed and the television coverage of the event was suppressed. Later, the ANC sought to drop proceedings.\n\nThe ANC's public condemnation of the painting brought widespread local and international attention to the painting, where otherwise it may have remained a relatively obscure piece of work. For this reason, the action and subsequent fall-out has been characterised as an example of the Streisand effect. Subsequently, \"The Spear\" has been featured in editorials and news features in all forms of traditional and digital media.\n\nFormer ANC leader Oliver Tambo‚Äôs daughter Tselane Tambo was of the opinion that Zuma deserved Murray‚Äôs portrayal of him. She wrote on a social networking site, ‚ÄúDo the poor enjoy poverty? Do the unemployed enjoy hopelessness? Do those who can‚Äôt get housing enjoy homelessness? He must get over it. No one is having a good time. He should inspire the reverence he craves. This portrait is what he inspired. Shame neh!‚Äù. \n\nThe media boycott of \"City Press\" by the ANC and various public figures led to the newspaper eventually removing the painting from its website on 28 May 2012. The paper's editor-in-chief Ferial Haffajee cited several reasons for this decision, including violent threats made to her team by those supporting the boycott.\n\nAfter \"City Press\" repeatedly refused to remove an image of the painting off their website, the ANC called upon its members and sympathisers to boycott placing advertising in, and buying of, the weekly paper. A statement released by the ANC said: \"Their refusal to remove this portrait from their website and their controlled social media is a clear indication that this newspaper does not belong to our shared democratic dispensation and values.\" Responding to the boycott, \"City Press\" editor-in-chief Ferial Haffajee described Nzimande's call for a boycott of the paper as \"deeply disturbing\".\n\nThe ANC was criticised by the South African National Editors' Forum (SANEF), which said \"While we recognise the right of the ANC to advise members on how to exercise their consumer decisions, the call for a boycott of a newspaper is tantamount to intimidation and abuse of power ... This kind of behaviour is unbecoming of a party that functions in an open democratic stage and especially one which leads the national government.\" The boycott of City Press was further condemned by the International Press Institute (IPI), and by 28 May, ten days after the newspaper printed the painting for the first time, opinions in the ANC had divided with several senior members opposing the boycott.\n\nOn the morning of 22 May 2012, two men entered the gallery during visiting hours, and defaced the painting - first by painting a red cross over the depiction of Zuma's face and genitals, and then by smearing black paint over the canvas. The two men ‚Äî Barend la Grange and Lowie Mabokela ‚Äî were arrested by security officials. This defacement took place whilst court proceedings brought on by the ANC around the right to censor the image were underway.\n\nThe way in which the two men were arrested also drew criticism: Barend la Grange was arrested without any apparent violence, while Lowie Mabokela was head-butted and thrown to the ground.\n\nOn 22 May 2012, the Film and Publication Board (FPB) of South Africa announced that a team of five classifiers had been sent to assess \"The Spear\", following specific complaints to the FPB, which is the statutory body responsible for classifying, and applying age ratings and content advisories to, works published or distributed in South Africa, including films, computer games, images of all kinds, and printed publications; however, \"Only pornographic publications need to be passed by the FPB before they are released on the market\" while others are considered based on \"complaints received from the public regarding specific publications\", and the FPB's jurisdiction specifically excludes newspapers and the broadcast media, which are regulated by separate entities. For this reason, the FPB proceedings could only consider the painting itself, its display by the gallery, and its publication or possible publication on websites or in other venues subject to FPB jurisdiction; and could not address the publication of images of it by newspapers or broadcasters. During the classification proceedings, there were allegations that the FPB was acting outside its statutory remit, and that specific members had made statements or asked questions implying that it was entitled to censor political opinions and restrict freedom of the press.\n\nOn 1 June 2012, the FPB announced that the classifiers assigned to 'The Spear' had rejected a complainant's call for the painting to be rated X18 (placing it within the category of legal pornographic works that must \"be passed by the FPB before they are released on the market\", and that may be distributed only by licensed distributors, who are required to obtain proof of age), but had decided on a 16N rating for the original, undefaced and uncensored, painting, meaning that measures should be put in place to prevent access to it and to images of it by those under the age of sixteen, and to advise \"sensitive adult viewers\" over sixteen that it contains nudity (but not explicit sexual content, which would have been designated by an S in the rating). In its press statement announcing the classification, the FPB referred at length to its statutory authority and responsibilities, in particular its role in \"promoting the safety of children\"; and explicitly denied that it had been influenced by political figures or had acted beyond its jurisdiction, saying that \"We believe that reports to the contrary have been specifically designed to defame the Film and Publication Board, question its integrity, competence, credibility as well as formulate as a reality the false notion that the state seeks to silence and censor the media by all means possible and with total disregard for accepted procedures and principles\". In reply to questions, FPB chief operations officer Mmapula Fisha said that \"The Spear\" differed from other works of art containing nudity, and merited the 16N classification, because \"The artwork has forced society to revisit its painful history\". After the classification was announced, the Goodman Gallery was reported to be seeking legal advice, but to have said they \"felt it would have a significant impact on freedom of artistic expression\", a criticism also made by commentators not involved in the case, while others expressed concern about political censorship. The full report of the classification committee responsible for assessing \"The Spear\" was subsequently made available online. The classification was open to appeal.\n\nOn 10 July 2012, the Goodman Gallery announced that it would be appealing the classification decision, and the following day the FPB confirmed that an appeal had been lodged. On 13 September 2012, the Goodman Gallery made written submissions to the Film and Publication Appeal Tribunal, and its written arguments were also made available to the press. The tribunal heard oral argument and evidence on 17 September 2012.\n\nOn 10 October 2012, the FPB announced that the Film and Publication Appeal Tribunal had upheld the Goodman Gallery's appeal, setting aside the classification and thereby removing all restrictions on publication of and access to the painting. The tribunal's full ruling was published on the same day. The Appeal Tribunal approved the original Classification Committee's determination that \"The Spear\" should not be classed as pornography, but found against the committee, its procedure, and its classification on several grounds, including that the decision had been based on flawed arguments and interpretation of the relevant law; that the committee had relied on conclusions for which no evidence had been presented either during the original classification process or to the Appeal Tribunal; that the FPB should not have considered a complaint against the publication of \"The Spear\" in newspapers or on their websites, because the FPB has no jurisdiction over such publications, and should instead have passed complaints against them on to the appropriate regulator; that the committee had wrongly taken upon itself \"responsibility for balancing conflicting rights\" that properly belonged to the courts, and was beyond the \"much narrower mandate [of] the Classification Committee\"; that the FPB had wrongly, and in violation both of the rights of their publishers and of legal principles of procedural fairness, \"appeared to extend its ruling to all websites that contained electronic replications of the painting and to all other publications of the painting\", rather than restricting its decision to the specific named respondents who had been accorded an opportunity to make representations during the classification process; that due weight had not been given to the painting's status as a work of agreed artistic merit enjoying greater statutory protection from both publication and age restrictions; that the committee had wrongly deemed nudity \"per se\" to be grounds for considering a work of art \"potentially disturbing, harmful, or inappropriate to children\"; and that the committee had used the system of \"restrictive age classifications\" designed solely to \"protect children\" (and not adults) from potentially \"disturbing, harmful, or age-inappropriate material\" and \"from premature exposure to adult experiences\" in a way that \"was not legally permissible\" for \"the purposes of protecting sensitive viewers or assuaging the sense of indignity felt by some segments of the community\" by effectively restricting adults' access to a published work that was neither illegal nor pornographic.\n\n\"The Spear\" portrait has invited comparison to other satirical pieces, including fellow South African artist Ayanda Mabulu's work, \"\" (Zulu: \"Better poor than a rich puppet\"), which depicts various regional and international political figures - including Jacob Zuma - in the nude. The painting received additional attention following the media focus on controversial satirical artworks.\n\n"}
{"id": "2545650", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2545650", "title": "Time travel in fiction", "text": "Time travel in fiction\n\nTime travel is a common theme in fiction and has been depicted in a variety of media, such as literature, television, film, and advertisements.\n\nThe concept of time travel by mechanical means was popularized in H. G. Wells' 1895 story, \"The Time Machine\". In general, time travel stories focus on the consequences of traveling into the past or the future. The central premise for these stories oftentimes involves changing history, either intentionally or by accident, and the ways by which altering the past changes the future and creates an altered present or future for the time traveler when they return home. Some stories focus solely on the paradoxes and alternate timelines that come with time travel, rather than time traveling itself. They often provide some sort of social commentary, as time travel provides a \"necessary distancing effect\" that allows science fiction to address contemporary issues in metaphorical ways.\n\nTime travel in modern fiction is sometimes achieved by space and time warps, stemming from the scientific theory of general relativity. Stories from antiquity often featured time travel into the future through a time slip brought on by traveling or sleeping, or in other cases, time travel into the past through supernatural means, for example brought on by angels or spirits.\n\nThe idea of changing the past is logically contradictory, and results in a grandfather paradox. Paul J. Nahin, who has written extensively on the topic of time travel in fiction, states that \"[e]ven though the consensus today is that the past cannot be changed, science fiction writers have used the idea of changing the past for good story effect\". Time travel to the past and precognition without the ability to change events may result in causal loops.\n\nThe possibility of characters inadvertently or intentionally changing the past also gave rise to the idea of \"time police\", people tasked with preventing such changes from occurring by themselves engaging in time travel to rectify such changes.\n\nAn alternative future or alternate future is a possible future that never comes to pass, typically when someone travels back into the past and alters it so that the events of the alternative future cannot occur, or when a communication from the future to the past effected a change that alters the future. Alternative histories may exist \"side by side\", with the time traveller actually arriving at different dimensions as he changes time.\n\nThe butterfly effect is the notion that small events can have large, widespread consequences. The term describes events observed in chaos theory where a very small change in initial conditions results in vastly different outcomes. The term was coined by mathematician Edward Lorenz years after the phenomenon was first described.\n\nThe butterfly effect has found its way into popular imagination. For example, in Ray Bradbury's 1952 short story \"A Sound of Thunder\", the killing of a single insect millions of years in the past drastically changes the world, and in the 2004 film \"The Butterfly Effect\", the protagonist's small changes to their past results in extreme changes.\n\nIn literature, communication from the future as a plot device is encountered in various science fiction and fantasy stories. Forrest J. Ackerman noted in his 1973 anthology of the best fiction of the year that \"[t]he theme of getting hold of tomorrow's newspaper is a recurrent one\". An early example of this device can be found in the H.G. Wells 1932 short story \"The Queer Story of Brownlow's Newspaper\", which tells the tale of a man who receives such a paper from 40 years in the future. The 1944 film \"It Happened Tomorrow\" also employs this device, with the protagonist receiving the next day's newspaper from an elderly colleague (who is possibly a ghost). Ackerman's anthology also highlights a short story by Robert Silverberg, \"What We Learned From This Morning's Newspaper\". In that story, a block of homeowners wake to discover that on November 22, they have received the \"New York Times\" for the coming December 1. As characters learn of future events affecting them through a newspaper delivered a week early, the ultimate effect is that this \"so upsets the future that spacetime is destroyed\". The television series \"Early Edition\", inspired by the film \"It Happened Tomorrow\", also revolved around a character who daily received the next day's newspaper, and sought to change some event therein forecast to happen.\n\nA newspaper from the future can be a fictional edition of a real newspaper, or an entirely fictional newspaper. John Buchan's novel \"The Gap in the Curtain\", is similarly premised on a group of people being enabled to see, for a moment, an item in \"Times\" newspaper from one year in the future. During the Swedish general election of 2006, the Swedish liberal party used election posters which looked like news items, called \"Framtidens nyheter\" (\"News of the future\"), featuring things that Sweden in the future had become what the party wanted.\n\nA communication from the future raises questions about the ability of humans to control their destiny. If the recipient is allowed to presume that the future is malleable, and if the future forecast affects them in some way, then this device serves as a convenient explanation of their motivations. In \"It Happened Tomorrow\", the events that are described in the newspaper do come to pass, and the protagonist's efforts to avoid those events set up circumstances which instead cause them to come about. By contrast, in \"Early Edition\", the protagonist is able to successfully prevent catastrophes predicted in the newspaper, although if the protagonist does nothing, these catastrophes do come about.\n\nWhere such a device is used, the source of the future news may not be explained, leaving it open to the reader or watcher to imagine that it might be technology, magic, an act of a god etc. In the H.G. Wells story, the author writes of the newspaper that \"apparently it had been delivered not by the postman, but by some other hand\". As in \"It Happened Tomorrow\" and \"Early Edition\", no explanation is offered for the source of the future news. Ackerman suggests that \"[t]he longer that authors mush on with the tale of... the next-week's-newspaper-now, the more difficult it becomes to pull a new rarebit out of the hat\".\n\nPrecognition has been explored as a form of time travel in fiction. Author J. B. Priestley wrote of it both in fiction and non-fiction, analysing testimonials of precognition and other \"temporal anomalies\" in his book \"Man and Time\". His books include time travel to the future through dreaming, which upon waking up results in memories from the future. Such memories, he writes, may also lead to the feeling of \"d√©j√† vu\", that the present events have already been experienced, and are now being re-experienced. Infallible precognition, which describes the future as it truly is, leads to causal loops, a form of which is explored in Newcomb's paradox. The film \"12 Monkeys\" heavily deals with themes of predestination and the Cassandra complex, where the protagonist who travels back in time explains that he can't change the past.\n\nA \"time loop\" or \"temporal loop\" is a plot device in which periods of time are repeated and re-experienced by the characters, and there is often some hope of breaking out of the cycle of repetition. Time loops are sometimes referred to as causal loops, but these two concepts are distinct. Although similar, causal loops are unchanging and self-originating, whereas time loops are constantly resetting. In a time loop when a certain condition is met, such as a death of a character or a clock reaching a certain time, the loop starts again, with one or more characters retaining the memories from the previous loop. Stories with time loops commonly center on the character learning from each successive loop through time.\n\nMany time travel works explore the topic of disrupting causality leading to time paradoxes. One of the most commonly referred to in time travel literature is known as the grandfather paradox. Many works of fiction explore what would happen if a time traveller went back in time and changed the past, for example if they killed their own grandparents.\n\nA time slip is a plot device used in fantasy and science fiction in which a person, or group of people, seem to travel through time by unknown means for a period of time. The idea of a time slip has been utilized by a number of science fiction and fantasy writers popularized at the end of the 19th century by Mark Twain's \"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\", having considerable influence on later writers. This is one of the main plot devices of time travel stories, the other being a time machine. The difference is that in time slip stories, the protagonist typically has no control and no understanding of the process (which is often never explained at all) and is either left marooned in a past time and must make the best of it, or is eventually returned by a process as unpredictable and uncontrolled. The plot device is also popular in children's literature.\n\nTime slips featuring a child and a realistic depiction of an earlier period enjoyed a vogue in the UK in the mid-20th century. Successful examples include Alison Uttley's \"A Traveller in Time\" (1939) going back to the time of Mary, Queen of Scots; Philippa Pearce's \"Tom's Midnight Garden\" (1958) returning to the 1880s and 1890s; Barbara Sleigh's \"Jessamy\" (1967) and Penelope Farmer's \"Charlotte Sometimes\", both slipping back to the period of the First World War; Ruth Park's \"Playing Beatie Bow\" (1980), where the slip in Sydney, Australia, is to the squalor of 1873; and Helen Cresswell's \"Moondial\", where three times periods are involved (1988, also televised).\n\nA \"distinct subgenre\" of stories explore the possibility that time travel might be used as a means of tourism, with travelers curious to visit periods or events such as the Victorian Era, Crucifixion of Christ, or some point where dinosaurs could be watched (or hunted by big game hunters), or to meet historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln or Ludwig van Beethoven. This theme can be addressed from two directions. An early example of present-day tourists travelling back to the past is Ray Bradburys \"A Sound of Thunder\" (1952), in which the protagonists are big game hunters who travel to the distant past to hunt dinosaurs. An early example of the other type, in which tourists from the future visit the present, is Catherine L. Moore and Henry Kuttners \"Vintage Season\" (1946), a story which was selected for inclusion in Volume Two of \"The Science Fiction Hall of Fame\" collection.\n\nInstances of immortality are prevalent in time travel fiction. Oxford defines immortality as \"the ability to live forever; eternal life.\" A distinct sub-thematic characteristic is warnings of said time-traveling immortals to other characters about the dangers of time travel. Some examples are 4th dimensional beings from \"Rick and Morty\", Professor Paradox from \"Ben 10\", and the Doctor from \"Doctor Who\".\n\n\"The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction\" describes a time war as a fictional war that is \"fought across time, usually with each side knowingly using time travel ... in an attempt to establish the ascendancy of one or another version of history\". Time wars are also known as \"change wars\" and \"temporal wars\".\n\nP. Nahin compiles a variety of examples of fictional works that raise issues framed as arising in a time war:\n\nIn Western fiction, one common use of time travel technology is to travel back in time and attempt to kill Adolf Hitler in an attempt to avoid World War II and the Holocaust.\n\nFiction that applies the Novikov self-consistency principle that the past can't be changed results in plots where attempts to assassinate Hitler or avert the war are destined to fail, or where they actually result in the rise of Hitler as history records it. Fiction that does allow the past to be changed often explores the unintended consequences of time travel or the butterfly effect, which result in Germany and Japan winning World War II. This outcome is also explored in parallel world fiction such as \"The Man in the High Castle\".\n\n\n"}
{"id": "19947780", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=19947780", "title": "Wiesbaden manifesto", "text": "Wiesbaden manifesto\n\nThe Wiesbaden manifesto is a document written and signed by members of the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives (MFAA) organization rejecting the plundering and removal of cultural items as spoils of war. The Allies created special commissions, such as the MFAA, to help protect famous European monuments from destruction, and after the war, to travel to territories previously occupied by the Germans to find Nazi art repositories. The allies found these plundered artworks in over 1,050 repositories in Germany and Austria at the end of World War II. The book \"The Safekeepers: Memoir of the Arts at the End of World War II\" by former Capt. Walter I. Farmer of the United States Army Corps of Engineers during World War II, chronicles the recovery of and restitution of discovered hidden loot of the Nazi plunder, that were stolen from museums, private collections and libraries and individual Jewish emigrants and death camp prisoners.\n\nIn summer 1945, Capt. Walter Farmer became the collecting point's first director. The first shipment of artworks arriving at Wiesbaden included cases of antiquities, Egyptian art, Islamic artifacts, and paintings from the Kaiser Friedrich Museum. The collecting point also received materials from the Reichsbank and Nazi looted Polish liturgical collections. At its height, Wiesbaden stored, identified, and restituted approximately 700,000 individual objects, including paintings and sculptures. The collecting point not only cataloged and restitutued items, but also kept them away from the Soviet Army and wartime reparations.\n\nWhen his superiors ordered that he send to the U.S. 202 German-owned paintings in his custody, Capt. Farmer and 35 others who were in charge of the Wiesbaden collection point gathered to draw up what has become known as the Wiesbaden Manifesto on November 7, 1945, declaring \"We wish to state that, from our own knowledge, no historical grievance will rankle so long or be the cause of so much justified bitterness as the removal for any reason of a part of the heritage of any nation even if that heritage may be interpreted as a prize of war.\" Among the co-signers was Lieutenant Charles Percy Parkhurst of the U.S. Navy.\n\nAfter three years of debate, U.S. President Harry S. Truman ordered that the paintings be returned to Germany in 1948.\n"}
{"id": "10284249", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10284249", "title": "Wild law", "text": "Wild law\n\nThe term ‚Äòwild law‚Äô was first coined by Cormac Cullinan, to refer to human laws that are consistent with Earth jurisprudence. A wild law is a law made by people to regulate human behaviour that privileges maintaining the integrity and functioning of the whole Earth community in the long term, over the interests of any species (including humans) at a particular time.\n\nWild laws are designed to regulate human participation within this wider community. They seek to balance the rights and responsibilities of humans against those of other members of the community of beings within the natural environment that constitutes Earth (e.g. plants, animals, rivers, and ecosystems) in order to safe-guard the rights of all the members of the Earth community.\n\nWild laws may be distinguished from laws based on the understanding that Earth is a conglomeration of objects which human beings are entitled to exploit for their exclusive benefit (e.g. most property laws). The development of wild laws is motivated partially by the belief that it is desirable, and essential to the survival of many species (probably including humans), for us to change our relationship with the natural world from one of exploitation to a more ‚Äòdemocratic‚Äô participation in a community of other beings. This requires laws that firstly, recognise that other members of the Earth community have rights, and secondly, restrain humans from unjustifiably infringing those rights (as is done within the human community).\n\nAs a field, wild law cannot easily be categorised within traditional legal categories (e.g. substantive, procedural, private or public law). It is perhaps better understood as an approach to human governance, rather than as a branch of law or a collection of laws.\n\nA conference based on the concept of wild law was held in November 2005 at the University of Brighton, UK. The conference was chaired by former Environment Minister Michael Meacher MP and speakers included Jacqueline McGlade, head of the European Environment Agency and Lynda Warren of the Environment Agency.\n\nIn November 2006, a conference based on the book \"Wild Law\" by Cormac Cullinan was held at the University of Brighton, UK, and organised jointly by UKELA and ELF. 'A Walk on the Wild Side: Changing Environmental Law' and was chaired by John Elkington (of SustainAbility and the ELF Advisory Council) with guest speakers, Cormac Cullinan, Norman Baker MP (former Liberal Democrat Environment Spokesman), Satish Kumar (Resurgence) and Begonia Filgueira (Gaia Law Ltd).\n\n\"A ‚ÄòWild Law‚Äô Response to Climate Change\" workshop was held in September 2007 to develop a practical approach for applying Wild Law principles which are already helping shift legal processes in the US and South Africa. Organised by UKELA, with support from ELF and the Gaia Foundation, London and sponsored by The Body Shop. Held at a conference centre in Derbyshire in the UK, with internationally renowned speakers Cormac Cullinan, author of \"Wild Law\", Professor Brian Goodwin, visiting scholar and teacher on MSc in Holistic Science, at the Schumacher College, International Centre for Ecological Studies, Devon, Andrew Kimbrell, executive director of The Center for Food Safety in USA and founder of the International Center for Technology Assessment, Peter Roderick, director of the Climate Justice Programme and was Friends of the Earth's lawyer in London from 1996.\n\nThe \"‚ÄôWild Law‚Äô - Ideas into Action\" residential workshop is to be held in September 2008, to launch the first phase of international research by the UKELA and the Gaia Foundation to identify Wild Law in practice and provide a Wild Law toolkit for decision makers and practitioners. Held at a conference centre in Derbyshire, UK, workshop leaders include: Mellese Damtie, Ethiopian lawyer and biologist, former Dean of the Legal Department at Ethiopia's Civil Service College, Andrew Kimbrell, public interest attorney, activist and author, executive director of the Centre for Food Safety in USA and founder of the International Centre for Technology Assessment; and Professor Lynda Warren, emeritus professor at Aberystwyth University, environmental consultant and the research supervisor.

However, he has also produced art in painting, photography and theater. He was included in the 2002 Whitney Biennial and is a Guggenheim Fellow and a recipient of the Creative Capital Visual Arts Award. Selected now for the second time, Pope.L will be included in the upcoming Whitney Biennial of 2017.\n\nPope.L attended Pratt Institute from 1973 to 1975 and participated in the Whitney Museum of American Art Independent Study Program from 1977 to 1978. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Montclair State University, Montclair, New Jersey, in 1978. He received a Master of Fine Arts degree in visual arts from the Mason Gross School of the Arts at Rutgers University, New Brunswick, New Jersey in 1981.\n\nFrom 1990 to 2010, Pope.L was a lecturer of Theater and Rhetoric at Bates College in Lewiston, Maine. As a faculty member he directed a production of Lorraine Hansberry's \"A Raisin In the Sun\", in which he used both African-American and Caucasian actors as members of the same family.\n\nFor \"ATM Piece\", performed in 1997, he attached himself with an eight-foot length of Italian sausage to the door of a Chase Bank in midtown Manhattan wearing nothing but a skirt made out of dollar bills.\n\n\"eRacism\", a project that Pope.L began during the late 1970s, included over 40 endurance-based performances consisting of ‚Äúcrawls‚Äù, varying in length and duration. In one example titled \"Tompkins Square Crawl\" (1991) Pope.L dressed in a business suit and crawled through the gutter in Tompkins Square Park, New York, pushing a potted flower with one hand. Another example titled \"The Great White Way\" involved a crawl which stretched over 22 miles and took five years to complete. For this performance he donned a Superman outfit and strapped a skateboard to his back. The crawl stretched the entire 22 miles of Broadway, in New York City. Documentation of this performance was included in the 2002 Whitney Biennial.\n\nIn 2001 the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) advisory renew panel granted Pope.L $42,000 in financing for a traveling retrospective called \"William Pope.L: eRacism\". Shortly after announcing the award, the acting chairman, Robert S. Martin, rescinded funding for the grant. Joel Wachs, then president of the Andy Warhol Foundation for Visual Arts, stated in the December 21 issue of \"The New York Times\": \"It is important, particularly in light of what I would consider an attack on freedom of expression, to stand firm. We want this exhibition to occur; we want other funders to step forward; we don't want the N.E.A.'s decision to be something that has the effect of stopping what I think is going to be an important exhibition of art.\" \nThe Warhol Foundation, in partnership with the Rockefeller Foundation and the LEF Foundation provided $50,000 in funding for the traveling retrospective to tour the United States. \"eRacism\" exhibited at the Institute of Contemporary Art at Maine College of Art; Diverse Works Art space, Houston, 2003; Portland Institute for Contemporary Art (PICA), Oregon, 2003; and Artists Space, New York, 2003 .\n\nThe catalog \"William Pope.L: Friendliest Black Artist in America\" was produced by curator Mark Bessire in conjunction with the retrospective exhibition.\n\nIn 2002 Pope.L received a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award. In 2004 he received a Guggenheim Fellowship. In 2005 \"The Black Factory\", an art installation on wheels, traveled from Maine to Missouri as part of The Interventionists show organized by the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (Mass MOCA). \"Typically the Factory arrives at a city or town and sets up its interactive workshop on the street. People bring objects that represent blackness to them. The Factory‚Äôs workers use these objects in tightly rehearsed but loosely performed skits to stimulate a conversation ‚Äî a flow of ideas, images and experiences. Most objects are photographed and made part of the Factory‚Äôs virtual library, some are housed in the Factory‚Äôs archive for later use, and some are pulverized in the Factory‚Äôs workshop to make new products available in the Factory‚Äôs gift shop.\"\n\nIn 2006 he was selected as one of the United States Artists fellows, for which he was awarded a $50,000 unrestricted grant.\n\nHe was featured alongside other performing artists: Sean Penn, Willem Dafoe, Brad Pitt, Steve Buscemi, and Juliette Binoche in Robert Wilson's LAB HD portraits. In 2008, Pope.L's piece \"One Substance, Eight Supports, One Situation\" was selected to participate in The Renaissance Society's group exhibition, \"Black Is, Black Ain't\".\n\nIn 2010 Pope.L was appointed faculty at the University of Chicago.\n\nIn 2015 MOCA, Los Angeles presented \"Trinket\", the largest solo museum presentation of Pope.L's work to date. The centerpiece of the show is \"Trinket\", a monumental, custom-made American flag (approximately 54 x 16 feet) hanging on a pole in the middle of the Geffen. During the museum's public hours the flag will be continuously blown by four large-scale industrial fans ‚Äî the type used on Hollywood film sets to create wind or rain effects ‚Äî and will be illuminated from below by a bank of custom theatrical lights. Over time the flag will appear to fray at its ends due to the constant whipping of the forced air, a potent metaphor for the rigors and complexities of democratic engagement and participation. \"Trinket\" was originally produced in 2008 at Grand Arts, in Kansas City, Mo., as the centerpiece of Pope.L's exhibition Animal Nationalism. \n\nIn 2015 Pope.L produced \"The Beautiful\", a new choreographed crawl performance staged for the first time at Art Basel in Miami Beach. For \"The Beautiful\", four men, dressed as Superman with skateboards strapped to their backs, roll onward in the dark. The rumbling of their wheels grows louder through speakers as they approach the crowd, and blends with the low churning of electric guitars. The ‚ÄòSuper-Gents‚Äô reach a wooden stage and crab-walk their way up, barely fitting onto the small surface. Holding each other, they finally break into a heart-rending, soulful version of the patriotic song America The Beautiful.\n\nPope.L's art focuses on issues of consumption, social class, and masculinity as they relate to race. He is quoted as saying of his own work: ‚ÄúI am a fisherman of social absurdity, if you will‚Ä¶ My focus is to politicize disenfranchisement, to make it neut, to reinvent what‚Äôs beneath us, to remind us where we all come from.‚Äù\n\nIn his Foundation for Contemporary Arts Fellowship bio, he writes: \"Like the African shaman who chews his pepper seeds and spits seven times into the air, I believe art re-ritualizes the everyday to reveal something fresh about our lives. This revelation is a vitality and it is a power to change the world.\".\n\n\n"}
