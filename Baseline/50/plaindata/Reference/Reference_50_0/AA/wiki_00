Published on 1 November 2012 (9 September 2013 in the US), it is a trivia book containing 1,227 facts collected during the making of the series, which had been ten years in the making at the time of publication.\n\nLloyd said in an interview with \"The Daily Telegraph\": \"This book is like a set of haiku. I think it's the best thing we've ever done. It has purity and simplicity.\"\n\nThe book contains lists of facts, normally four per page. All the sources for the facts are listed online on the QI website. Other than Lloyd, Mitchinson and Harkin, credit for authorship is also given to \"QI\" researchers (also known as \"Elves\") Anne Miller, Andy Murray and Alex Bell.\n\nThe reason for the number of facts being 1,227, according to Lloyd and Mitchinson, was that they had originally planned to have 1,000 facts and when they wrote down the list containing all the facts that would go in the book, they discovered that they had gone past the number, to 1,227.\n\n"}

The report takes in matters such as the area FDI (Fire Danger Index), the blocks ground slope, vegetation type and density to determine the intensity of fire attack, split into 6 levels. The six levels relate to the intensity of Radiant Heat exposure, with the levels being BAL-LOW (no threat or construction changes needed), BAL-12.5 (Radiant Heat levels would calculate 12.5 kW/m²), BAL-19 (19 kW/m²), BAL-29 (29 kW/m²), BAL-40 (40 kW/m²) and BAL-FZ (Flame Zone, which can be as high as 100 kW/m²).\nAS3959:2009 therefore instructs what changes and test methods are required for construction to comply to the BAL Assessed levels.\nAS3959:2009 from 1 May 2010 has been adopted as part of the BCA (Building Code Of Australia).\n\nCopies of Australian Standards such as AS3959 are available from SAI Global, or see organisations such as the Victorian Building Authority, Victorian Country Fire Authority or the NSW Rural Fire Service for further information and guidelines on this subject.\n\n"}

She travelled extensively in Europe and the United States and in 1893 found fame with her debut novel, \"Ships That Pass in the Night\", a love story set in a tuberculosis sanatorium.

{"id": "6328", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=6328", "title": "Cognate", "text": "Cognate\n\nIn linguistics, cognates are words that have a common etymological origin. A cognate etymon need not be inherited directly from a proto-language; the etymon can be borrowed from some other language, in which evolution produces cognate forms. For example, the English word \"dish\" and the German word \"Tisch\" (\"table\") are cognates because they both come from Latin \"discus\", which relates to their flat surfaces. Cognates may have evolved similar, different or even opposite meanings, but in most cases there are some similar letters in the word. Some words sound similar, but don't come from the same root; these are called false cognates.\n\nIn etymology, the \"cognate\" category excludes doublets and loanwords. The word \"cognate\" derives from the Latin noun \"cognatus\", which means \"blood relative\".\n\nCognates do not need to have the same meaning, which may have changed as the languages developed separately. For example English \"starve\" and Dutch \"sterven\" or German \"sterben\" (\"to die\") all derive from the same Proto-Germanic root, \"*sterbaną\" (\"die\"). \"Discus\" is from Greek \"δίσκος\" (from the verb \"δικεῖν\" \"to throw\"). A later and separate English reflex of \"discus\", probably through medieval Latin \"desca\", is \"desk\" (see OED s.v. \"desk\").\n\nCognates also do not need to have similar forms: English \"father\", French \"père\", and Armenian հայր (\"hayr\") all descend directly from Proto-Indo-European \"*ph₂tḗr\".\n\nExamples of cognates in Indo-European languages are the words \"night\" (English), \"nuit\" (French), \"noche\" (Spanish), \"Nacht\" (German), \"nacht\" (Dutch), \"nag\" (Afrikaans), \"nicht\" (Scots), \"natt\" (Swedish, Norwegian), \"nat\" (Danish), \"nátt\" (Faroese), \"nótt\" (Icelandic), \"noc\" (Czech, Slovak, Polish), ночь, \"noch\" (Russian), ноќ, \"noć\" (Macedonian), нощ, \"nosht\" (Bulgarian), \"ніч\", \"nich\" (Ukrainian), \"ноч\", \"noch\"/\"noč\" (Belarusian), \"noč\" (Slovene), \"noć\" (Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian), νύξ, \"nyx\" (Ancient Greek, \"νύχτα\"/\"nychta\" in Modern Greek), \"nox/nocte\" (Latin), \"nakt-\" (Sanskrit), \"natë\" (Albanian), \"nos\" (Welsh), \"nueche\" (Asturian), \"noite\" (Portuguese and Galician), \"notte\" (Italian), \"nit\" (Catalan), \"nuèch/nuèit\" (Occitan), \"noapte\" (Romanian), \"nakts\" (Latvian), \"naktis\" (Lithuanian) and \"Naach\" (Colognian), all meaning \"night\" and being derived from the Proto-Indo-European \"night\".\n\nAnother Indo-European example is \"star\" (English), \"str-\" (Sanskrit), \"tara\" (Hindustani and Bengali), \"tora\" (Assamese), \"astre\"/\"étoile\" (French), \"ἀστήρ (astēr)\" (Greek or \"ἀστέρι\"/\"ἄστρο\", \"asteri\"/\"astro\" in Modern Greek), \"astro/stella\" (Italian), \"aster\" (Latin) \"stea\" (Romanian and Venetian), \"stairno\" (Gothic), \"astgh\" (Armenian), \"Stern\" (German), \"ster\" (Dutch and Afrikaans), \"Schtähn\" (Colognian), \"starn\" (Scots), \"stjerne\" (Norwegian and Danish), \"stjarna\" (Icelandic), \"stjärna\" (Swedish), \"stjørna\" (Faroese), \"setāre\" (Persian), \"stoorei\" (Pashto), \"seren\" (Welsh), \"steren\" (Cornish), \"estel\" (Catalan), \"estela\" (Occitan) \"estrella\" and \"astro\" Spanish, \"estrella\" Asturian and Leonese, \"estrela\" and \"astro\" (Portuguese and Galician) and \"estêre\" or \"stêrk\" (Kurdish), from the Proto-Indo-European \"star\".\n\nThe Arabic \"salām\", the Hebrew \"shalom\", the Assyrian Neo-Aramaic \"shlama\" and the Amharic \"selam\" (\"peace\") are also cognates, derived from the Proto-Semitic *šalām- \"peace\".\n\nCognates may often be less easily recognised than the above examples, and authorities sometimes differ in their interpretations of the evidence. The English word \"milk\" is clearly a cognate of German \"Milch\", Dutch \"melk\", Russian \"молоко (moloko)\" and Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian, Slovenian \"mleko\", also Montenegrin \"mlijeko\". On the other hand, French \"lait\", Catalan \"llet\", Italian \"latte\", Romanian \"lapte\", Spanish \"leche\" and \"leite\" (Portuguese and Galician) (all meaning \"milk\") are less-obvious cognates of Ancient Greek \"\" \"gálaktos\" (genitive singular of \"gála\", \"milk\"), a relationship that is more evidently seen through the intermediate Latin \"lac\" \"milk\" as well as the English word \"lactic\" and other terms borrowed from Latin. All of them come from Proto-Indo-European \"milk\".\n\nSome cognates are semantic opposites. For instance, while the Hebrew word \"chutzpah\" means \"impudence,\" its Classical Arabic cognate \"ḥaṣāfah\" means \"sound judgment.\"\n\nCognates within a single language, or \"doublets\", may have meanings that are slightly or even totally different. For example, English \"ward\" and \"guard\" (<PIE \"*wer-\", \"to perceive, watch out for\") are cognates, as are \"shirt\" (garment on top) and \"skirt\" (garment on bottom) (<PIE \"*sker-\", \"to cut\"). In some cases, including this one, one cognate (\"skirt\") has an ultimate source in another language related to English, but the other one (\"shirt\") is native. That happened with many loanwords, such as \"skirt\" in this example, which was borrowed from Old Norse during the Danelaw.\n\nSometimes both doublets come from other languages, often the same one but at different times. For example, the word \"chief\" (meaning the leader of any group) comes from the Middle French \"chef\" (\"head\"), and its modern pronunciation preserves the Middle French consonant sound; the word \"chef\" (the leader of the cooks) was borrowed from the same source centuries later, but by then, the consonant had changed to a \"sh\" sound in French. Such word sets can also be called etymological twins, and they may come in groups of higher numbers, as with, for example, the words \"wain\" (native), \"waggon/wagon\" (Dutch), and \"vehicle\" (Latin) in English.\n\nA word may also enter another language, develop a new form or meaning there, and be re-borrowed into the original language; that is called reborrowing. For example, the Greek word \"κίνημα\" (\"kinima\", \"movement\") became French \"cinéma\" (compare American English \"movie\") and then later returned to Greece as \"σινεμά\" (\"sinema\", \"the art of film\", \"movie theater\"). In Greek, \"κίνημα\" (\"kinima\", \"movement\") and \"σινεμά\" (\"sinema\", \"filmmaking, cinema\") are now doublets.\n\nA less obvious English-language doublet pair is \"grammar\" and \"glamour\".\n\nFalse cognates are words that people commonly believe are related (have a common origin), but that linguistic examination reveals are unrelated. For example, on the basis of superficial similarities, the Latin verb \"habēre\" and German \"haben\", both meaning 'to have', appear to be cognates. However, because the words evolved from different roots, in this case, different Proto-Indo-European (PIE) roots, they cannot be cognate (see for example Grimm's law). German \"haben\", like English \"have\", comes from PIE \"*kh₂pyé-\" 'to grasp', and its real cognate in Latin is \"capere\", 'to seize, grasp, capture'. Latin \"habēre\", on the other hand, is from PIE \"*gʰabʰ\", 'to give, to receive', and hence cognate with English \"give\" and German \"geben\".\n\nLikewise, English \"much\" and Spanish \"mucho\" look similar and have a similar meaning but are not cognates, as they evolved from different roots: \"much\" from Proto-Germanic \"*mikilaz\" < PIE \"*meǵ-\" and \"mucho\" from Latin \"multum\" < PIE \"*mel-\".\n\n\n\n"}

It is closely related to evolutionary biology and phylogeny (the evolution of species). \n\nThe science began in the classical era, continuing in Early Modern times with work by Pierre Belon who noted the similarities of the skeletons of birds and humans.\n\nComparative anatomy has provided evidence of common descent, and has assisted in the classification of animals.\n\nThe first specifically anatomical investigation separate from a surgical or medical procedure is associated by early commentators with Alcmaeon of Croton. Pierre Belon, a French naturalist born in 1517, conducted research and held discussions on dolphin embryos as well as the comparisons between the skeletons of birds to the skeletons of humans. His research led to modern comparative anatomy.\n\nAround the same time, Andreas Vesalius was also making some strides of his own. A young anatomist of Flemish descent made famous by a penchant for amazing charts, he was systematically investigating and correcting the anatomical knowledge of the Greek physician Galen. He noticed that many of Galen's observations were not even based on actual humans. Instead, they were based on animals such as oxen. Up until that point, Galen and his teachings had been the authority on human anatomy. The irony is that Galen himself had emphasized the fact that one should make one's own observations instead of using those of another, but this advice was lost during the numerous translations of his work. As Vesalius began to uncover these mistakes, other physicians of the time began to trust their own observations more than those of Galen. An interesting observation made by some of these physicians was the presence of homologous structures in a wide variety of animals which included humans. These observations were later used by Darwin as he formed his theory of Natural Selection.\n\nEdward Tyson is regarded as the founder of modern comparative anatomy. He is credited with determining that whales and dolphins are, in fact, mammals. Also, he concluded that chimpanzees are more similar to humans than to monkeys because of their arms. Marco Aurelio Severino also compared various animals, including birds, in his \"Zootomia democritaea\", one of the first works of comparative anatomy. In the 18th and 19th century, great anatomists like George Cuvier, Richard Owen and Thomas Henry Huxley revolutionized our understanding of the basic build and systematics of vertebrates, laying the foundation for Charles Darwin's work on evolution. An example of a 20th-century comparative anatomist is Victor Negus, who worked on the structure and evolution of the larynx. Until the advent of genetic techniques like DNA sequencing, comparative anatomy together with embryology were the primary tools for understanding phylogeny, as exemplified by the work of Alfred Romer.\n\nTwo major concepts of comparative anatomy are:\n\nComparative anatomy has long served as evidence for evolution, now joined in that role by comparative genomics; it indicates that organisms share a common ancestor.\n\nIt also assists scientists in classifying organisms based on similar characteristics of their anatomical structures. A common example of comparative anatomy is the similar bone structures in forelimbs of cats, whales, bats, and humans. All of these appendages consist of the same basic parts; yet, they serve completely different functions. The skeletal parts which form a structure used for swimming, such as a fin, would not be ideal to form a wing, which is better-suited for flight. One explanation for the forelimbs' similar composition is descent with modification. Through random mutations and natural selection, each organism's anatomical structures gradually adapted to suit their respective habitats. The rules for development of \"special\" characteristics which differ significantly from general homology were listed by Karl Ernst von Baer as the laws now named after him.\n\n\n"}
{"id": "7378", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7378", "title": "Comparative law", "text": "Comparative law\n\nComparative law is the study of differences and similarities between the law (legal systems) of different countries. More specifically, it involves the study of the different legal \"systems\" (or \"families\") in existence in the world, including the common law, the civil law, socialist law, Canon law, Jewish Law, Islamic law, Hindu law, and Chinese law. It includes the description and analysis of foreign legal systems, even where no explicit comparison is undertaken. The importance of comparative law has increased enormously in the present age of internationalism, economic globalization, and democratization.\n\nThe origins of modern Comparative Law can be traced back to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1667 in his Latin-language book Nova Methodus Discendae Docendaeque Iurisprudentiae (New Methods of Studying and Teaching Jurisprudence). Chapter 7 (Presentation of Law as the Project for all Nations, Lands and Times) introduces the idea of classifying Legal Systems into several families. Notably, a few years earlier, Leibnitz introduced an idea of Language families.\n\nAlthough every Legal System is unique, Comparative Law through studies of their similarities and differences allows for classification of Legal Systems, wherein Law Families is the basic level of the classification. The main differences between Law Families are found in the source(s) of Law, the role of court precedents, the origin and development of the Legal System. Montesquieu is generally regarded as an early founding figure of comparative law. His comparative approach is obvious in the following excerpt from Chapter III of Book I of his masterpiece, \"De l'esprit des lois\" (1748; first translated by Thomas Nugent, 1750):\n\nAlso, in Chapter XI (entitled 'How to compare two different Systems of Laws') of Book XXIX, discussing the French and English systems for punishment of false witnesses, he advises that \"to determine which of those systems is most agreeable to reason, we must take them each as a whole and compare them in their entirety.\" Yet another place where Montesquieu's comparative approach is evident is the following, from Chapter XIII of Book XXIX:\n\nThe modern founding figure of comparative and anthropological jurisprudence was Sir Henry Maine, a British jurist and legal historian. In his 1861 work \"Ancient Law: Its Connection with the Early History of Society, and Its Relation to Modern Ideas\", he set out his views on the development of legal institutions in primitive societies and engaged in a comparative discussion of Eastern and Western legal traditions. This work placed comparative law in its historical context and was widely read and influential.\n\nThe first university course on the subject was established at the University of Oxford in 1869, with Maine taking up the position of professor.\n\nComparative law in the US was brought by a legal scholar fleeing persecution in Germany, Rudolf Schlesinger. Schlesinger eventually became professor of comparative law at Cornell Law School helping to spread the discipline throughout the US.\n\nComparative law is an academic discipline that involves the study of legal systems, including their constitutive elements and how they differ, and how their elements combine into a system.\n\nSeveral disciplines have developed as separate branches of comparative law, including comparative constitutional law, comparative administrative law, comparative civil law (in the sense of the law of torts, delicts, contracts and obligations), comparative commercial law (in the sense of business organisations and trade), and comparative criminal law. Studies of these specific areas may be viewed as micro- or macro-comparative legal analysis, i.e. detailed comparisons of two countries, or broad-ranging studies of several countries. Comparative civil law studies, for instance, show how the law of private relations is organised, interpreted and used in different systems or countries. The purposes of comparative law are:\n\nComparative law is different from the fields of general jurisprudence (legal theory), international law, including both public international law and private international law (also known as conflict of laws).\n\nDespite the differences between comparative law and these other legal fields, comparative law helps inform all of these areas of normativity. For example, comparative law can help international legal institutions, such as those of the United Nations System, in analyzing the laws of different countries regarding their treaty obligations. Comparative law would be applicable to private international law when developing an approach to interpretation in a conflicts analysis. Comparative law may contribute to legal theory by creating categories and concepts of general application. Comparative law may also provide insights into the question of legal transplants, i.e. the transplanting of law and legal institutions from one system to another. The notion of legal transplants was coined by Alan Watson, one of the world's renowned legal scholars specializing in comparative law.\n\nAlso, the usefulness of comparative law for sociology of law and law and economics (and vice versa) is very large. The comparative study of the various legal systems may show how different legal regulations for the same problem function in practice. Conversely, sociology of law and law & economics may help comparative law answer questions, such as: \n\nArminjon, Nolde, and Wolff believed that, for purposes of classifying the (then) contemporary legal systems of the world, it was required that those systems \"per se\" get studied, irrespective of external factors, such as geographical ones. They proposed the classification of legal system into seven groups, or so-called 'families', in particular the\n\n\nRené David proposed the classification of legal systems, according to the different ideology inspiring each one, into five groups or families:\nEspecially with respect to the aggregating by David of the Romano-Germanic and Anglo-Saxon Laws into a single family, David argued that the antithesis between the Anglo-Saxon Laws and Romano-German Laws, is of a technical rather than of an ideological nature. Of a different kind is, for instance, the antithesis between (say) the Italian and the American Law, and of a different kind that between the Soviet, Muslim, Hindu, or Chinese Law. According to David, the Romano-Germanic legal systems included those countries where legal science was formulated according to Roman Law, whereas common law countries are those where law was created from the judges. The characteristics that he believed uniquely differentiate the Western legal family from the other four are\n\nKonrad Zweigert and Hein Kötz propose a different, multidimensional methodology for categorizing laws, i.e. for ordering families of laws. They maintain that, to determine such families, five criteria should be taken into account, in particular: the historical background, the characteristic way of thought, the different institutions, the recognized sources of law, and the dominant ideology. Using the aforementioned criteria, they classify the legal systems of the world into six families:\n\nUp to the second German edition of their introduction to comparative law, Zweigert and Kötz also used to mention Soviet or socialist law as another family of laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}

{"id": "1338683", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1338683", "title": "Corecursion", "text": "Corecursion\n\nIn computer science, corecursion is a type of operation that is dual to recursion. Whereas recursion works analytically, starting on data further from a base case and breaking it down into smaller data and repeating until one reaches a base case, corecursion works synthetically, starting from a base case and building it up, iteratively producing data further removed from a base case. Put simply, corecursive algorithms use the data that they themselves produce, bit by bit, as they become available, and needed, to produce further bits of data. A similar but distinct concept is \"generative recursion\" which may lack a definite \"direction\" inherent in corecursion and recursion.\n\nWhere recursion allows programs to operate on arbitrarily complex data, so long as they can be reduced to simple data (base cases), corecursion allows programs to produce arbitrarily complex and potentially infinite data structures, such as streams, so long as it can be produced from simple data (base cases) in a sequence of \"finite\" steps. Where recursion may not terminate, never reaching a base state, corecursion starts from a base state, and thus produces subsequent steps deterministically, though it may proceed indefinitely (and thus not terminate under strict evaluation), or it may consume more than it produces and thus become non-\"productive\". Many functions that are traditionally analyzed as recursive can alternatively, and arguably more naturally, be interpreted as corecursive functions that are terminated at a given stage, for example recurrence relations such as the factorial.\n\nCorecursion can produce both finite and infinite data structures as results, and may employ self-referential data structures. Corecursion is often used in conjunction with lazy evaluation, to produce only a finite subset of a potentially infinite structure (rather than trying to produce an entire infinite structure at once). Corecursion is a particularly important concept in functional programming, where corecursion and codata allow total languages to work with infinite data structures.\n\nCorecursion can be understood by contrast with recursion, which is more familiar. While corecursion is primarily of interest in functional programming, it can be illustrated using imperative programming, which is done below using the generator facility in Python. In these examples local variables are used, and assigned values imperatively (destructively), though these are not necessary in corecursion in pure functional programming. In pure functional programming, rather than assigning to local variables, these computed values form an invariable sequence, and prior values are accessed by self-reference (later values in the sequence reference earlier values in the sequence to be computed). The assignments simply express this in the imperative paradigm and explicitly specify where the computations happen, which serves to clarify the exposition.\n\nA classic example of recursion is computing the factorial, which is defined recursively by \"0! := 1\" and \"n! := n × (n - 1)!\".\n\nTo \"recursively\" compute its result on a given input, a recursive function calls (a copy of) \"itself\" with a different (\"smaller\" in some way) input and uses the result of this call to construct its result. The recursive call does the same, unless the \"base case\" has been reached. Thus a call stack develops in the process. For example, to compute \"fac(3)\", this recursively calls in turn \"fac(2)\", \"fac(1)\", \"fac(0)\" (\"winding up\" the stack), at which point recursion terminates with \"fac(0) = 1\", and then the stack unwinds in reverse order and the results are calculated on the way back along the call stack to the initial call frame \"fac(3)\" that uses the result of \"fac(2) = 2\" to calculate the final result as \"3 × 2 = 3 × fac(2) =: fac(3)\" and finally return \"fac(3) = 6\". In this example a function returns a single value.\n\nThis stack unwinding can be explicated, defining the factorial \"corecursively\", as an iterator, where one \"starts\" with the case of formula_1, then from this starting value constructs factorial values for increasing numbers \"1, 2, 3...\" as in the above recursive definition with \"time arrow\" reversed, as it were, by reading it \"backwards\" as The corecursive algorithm thus defined produces a \"stream\" of \"all\" factorials. This may be concretely implemented as a generator. Symbolically, noting that computing next factorial value requires keeping track of both \"n\" and \"f\" (a previous factorial value), this can be represented as:\nor in Haskell, \n\nmeaning, \"starting from formula_3, on each step the next values are calculated as formula_4\". This is mathematically equivalent and almost identical to the recursive definition, but the formula_5 emphasizes that the factorial values are being built \"up\", going forwards from the starting case, rather than being computed after first going backwards, \"down\" to the base case, with a formula_6 decrement. Note also that the direct output of the corecursive function does not simply contain the factorial formula_7 values, but also includes for each value the auxiliary data of its index \"n\" in the sequence, so that any one specific result can be selected among them all, as and when needed.\n\nNote the connection with denotational semantics, where the denotations of recursive programs is built up corecursively in this way.\n\nIn Python, a recursive factorial function can be defined as:\n\nThis could then be called for example as codice_1 to compute \"5!\".\n\nA corresponding corecursive generator can be defined as:\n\nThis generates an infinite stream of factorials in order; a finite portion of it can be produced by:\n\nThis could then be called to produce the factorials up to \"5!\" via:\n\nIf we're only interested in a certain factorial, just the last value can be taken, or we can fuse the production and the access into one function,\n\nAs can be readily seen here, this is practically equivalent (just by substituting codice_2 for the only codice_3 there) to the accumulator argument technique for tail recursion, unwound into an explicit loop. Thus it can be said that the concept of corecursion is an explication of the embodiment of iterative computation processes by recursive definitions, where applicable.\n\nIn the same way, the Fibonacci sequence can be represented as:\nNote that because the Fibonacci sequence is a recurrence relation of order 2, the corecursive relation must track two successive terms, with the formula_9 corresponding to shift forward by one step, and the formula_10 corresponding to computing the next term. This can then be implemented as follows (using parallel assignment):\n\nIn Haskell, \n\nTree traversal via a depth-first approach is a classic example of recursion. Dually, breadth-first traversal can very naturally be implemented via corecursion.\n\nWithout using recursion or corecursion specifically, one may traverse a tree by starting at the root node, placing its child nodes in a data structure, then iterating by removing node after node from the data structure while placing each removed node's children back into that data structure. If the data structure is a stack (LIFO), this yields depth-first traversal, and if the data structure is a queue (FIFO), this yields breadth-first traversal.\n\nUsing recursion, a (post-order) depth-first traversal can be implemented by starting at the root node and recursively traversing each child subtree in turn (the subtree based at each child node) – the second child subtree does not start processing until the first child subtree is finished. Once a leaf node is reached or the children of a branch node have been exhausted, the node itself is visited (e.g., the value of the node itself is outputted). In this case, the call stack (of the recursive functions) acts as the stack that is iterated over.\n\nUsing corecursion, a breadth-first traversal can be implemented by starting at the root node, outputting its value, then breadth-first traversing the subtrees – i.e., passing on the \"whole list\" of subtrees to the next step (not a single subtree, as in the recursive approach) – at the next step outputting the value of all of their root nodes, then passing on their child subtrees, etc. In this case the generator function, indeed the output sequence itself, acts as the queue. As in the factorial example (above), where the auxiliary information of the index (which step one was at, \"n\") was pushed forward, in addition to the actual output of \"n\"!, in this case the auxiliary information of the remaining subtrees is pushed forward, in addition to the actual output. Symbolically:\nmeaning that at each step, one outputs the list of values of root nodes, then proceeds to the child subtrees. Generating just the node values from this sequence simply requires discarding the auxiliary child tree data, then flattening the list of lists (values are initially grouped by level (depth); flattening (ungrouping) yields a flat linear list). In Haskell, \nThese can be compared as follows. The recursive traversal handles a \"leaf node\" (at the \"bottom\") as the base case (when there are no children, just output the value), and \"analyzes\" a tree into subtrees, traversing each in turn, eventually resulting in just leaf nodes – actual leaf nodes, and branch nodes whose children have already been dealt with (cut off \"below\"). By contrast, the corecursive traversal handles a \"root node\" (at the \"top\") as the base case (given a node, first output the value), treats a tree as being \"synthesized\" of a root node and its children, then produces as auxiliary output a list of subtrees at each step, which are then the input for the next step – the child nodes of the original root are the root nodes at the next step, as their parents have already been dealt with (cut off \"above\"). Note also that in the recursive traversal there is a distinction between leaf nodes and branch nodes, while in the corecursive traversal there is no distinction, as each node is treated as the root node of the subtree it defines.\n\nNotably, given an infinite tree, the corecursive breadth-first traversal will traverse all nodes, just as for a finite tree, while the recursive depth-first traversal will go down one branch and not traverse all nodes, and indeed if traversing post-order, as in this example (or in-order), it will visit no nodes at all, because it never reaches a leaf. This shows the usefulness of corecursion rather than recursion for dealing with infinite data structures.\n\nIn Python, this can be implemented as follows.\nThe usual post-order depth-first traversal can be defined as:\n\nThis can then be called by codice_4 to print the values of the nodes of the tree in post-order depth-first order.\n\nThe breadth-first corecursive generator can be defined as:\n\nThis can then be called to print the values of the nodes of the tree in breadth-first order:\n\nInitial data types can be defined as being the least fixpoint (up to isomorphism) of some type equation; the isomorphism is then given by an initial algebra. Dually, final (or terminal) data types can be defined as being the greatest fixpoint of a type equation; the isomorphism is then given by a final coalgebra.\n\nIf the domain of discourse is the category of sets and total functions, then final data types may contain infinite, non-wellfounded values, whereas initial types do not. On the other hand, if the domain of discourse is the category of complete partial orders and continuous functions, which corresponds roughly to the Haskell programming language, then final types coincide with initial types, and the corresponding final coalgebra and initial algebra form an isomorphism.\n\nCorecursion is then a technique for recursively defining functions whose range (codomain) is a final data type, dual to the way that ordinary recursion recursively defines functions whose domain is an initial data type.\n\nThe discussion below provides several examples in Haskell that distinguish corecursion. Roughly speaking, if one were to port these definitions to the category of sets, they would still be corecursive. This informal usage is consistent with existing textbooks about Haskell. Also note that the examples used in this article predate the attempts to define corecursion and explain what it is.\n\nThe rule for \"primitive corecursion\" on codata is the dual to that for primitive recursion on data. Instead of descending on the argument by pattern-matching on its constructors (that \"were called up before\", somewhere, so we receive a ready-made datum and get at its constituent sub-parts, i.e. \"fields\"), we ascend on the result by filling-in its \"destructors\" (or \"observers\", that \"will be called afterwards\", somewhere - so we're actually calling a constructor, creating another bit of the result to be observed later on). Thus corecursion \"creates\" (potentially infinite) codata, whereas ordinary recursion \"analyses\" (necessarily finite) data. Ordinary recursion might not be applicable to the codata because it might not terminate. Conversely, corecursion is not strictly necessary if the result type is data, because data must be finite.\n\nIn \"Programming with streams in Coq: a case study: the Sieve of Eratosthenes\" we find\n\nwhere primes \"are obtained by applying the primes operation to the stream (Enu 2)\". Following the above notation, the sequence of primes (with a throwaway 0 prefixed to it) and numbers streams being progressively sieved, can be represented as \nor in Haskell, \n\nThe authors discuss how the definition of codice_5 is not guaranteed always to be \"productive\", and could become stuck e.g. if called with codice_6 as the initial stream.\n\nHere is another example in Haskell. The following definition produces the list of Fibonacci numbers in linear time:\nThis infinite list depends on lazy evaluation; elements are computed on an as-needed basis, and only finite prefixes are ever explicitly represented in memory. This feature allows algorithms on parts of codata to terminate; such techniques are an important part of Haskell programming.\n\nThis can be done in Python as well:\nThe definition of codice_7 can be inlined, leading to this:\n\nThis example employs a self-referential \"data structure\". Ordinary recursion makes use of self-referential \"functions\", but does not accommodate self-referential data. However, this is not essential to the Fibonacci example. It can be rewritten as follows:\n\nThis employs only self-referential \"function\" to construct the result. If it were used with strict list constructor it would be an example of runaway recursion, but with non-strict list constructor this guarded recursion gradually produces an indefinitely defined list.\n\nCorecursion need not produce an infinite object; a corecursive queue is a particularly good example of this phenomenon. The following definition produces a breadth-first traversal of a binary tree in linear time:\n\nThis definition takes an initial tree and produces a list of subtrees. This list serves dual purpose as both the queue and the result ( produces its output notches after its input back-pointer, , along the ). It is finite if and only if the initial tree is finite. The length of the queue must be explicitly tracked in order to ensure termination; this can safely be elided if this definition is applied only to infinite trees. \n\nAnother particularly good example gives a solution to the problem of breadth-first labeling. The function codice_8 visits every node in a binary tree in a breadth first fashion, and replaces each label with an integer, each subsequent integer is bigger than the last by one. This solution employs a self-referential data structure, and the binary tree can be finite or infinite.\n\nAn apomorphism (such as an anamorphism, such as unfold) is a form of corecursion in the same way that a paramorphism (such as a catamorphism, such as fold) is a form of recursion.\n\nThe Coq proof assistant supports corecursion and coinduction using the CoFixpoint command.\n\nCorecursion, referred to as \"circular programming,\" dates at least to , who credits John Hughes and Philip Wadler; more general forms were developed in . The original motivations included producing more efficient algorithms (allowing 1 pass over data in some cases, instead of requiring multiple passes) and implementing classical data structures, such as doubly linked lists and queues, in functional languages.\n\n\n"}

This goal is also pursued by Mario Wandruszka.\n\nTypological questions have mainly been dealt with by the \"Eurolinguistischer Arbeitskreis Mannheim (ELAMA; led by Per Sture Ureland)\" and the \"EUROTYP\" projects. Important sources of linguistic data for Eurolinguistic studies are the \"Atlas Linguarum Europae\" (for vocabulary studies) and the \"World Atlas of Linguistic Structures\" (Haspelmath et al. 2005, for grammar studies).\n\nThe internet platform \"EuroLinguistiX (ELiX)\" (edited by Joachim Grzega) offers a bibliography of Eurolinguistic publications as well as a wiki, a discussion forum, an academic internet journal in order to address also aspects of \"linguistic and cultural history\", \"sociology of languages\", \"language politics\" and \"intercultural communication\". In 2006, Joachim Grzega published a basic reader on common features of European languages.\n\nAlso joint with the \"ELAMA\", the \"EuroLSJ project\" by Erhard Steller tries to collect essential results of Eurolinguistics and make them usable for everyday life in Europe by transforming them into a representative standard language (\"LSJ European / Europé LSJ\") which wants to serve as an optimized \"acquisition and memory helper\" (Giuseppe G. Castorina) for a quicker and easier access to all languages of Europe.\n\nWriting was introduced by the Greeks and from there also brought to the Romans (6th century BC). There are five alphabets in regular use in the areas generally considered Europe. The Latin alphabet was developed into several scripts. In the early years of Europe, the Carolingian minuscules were the most important variety of the Latin script. From this two branches developed, the Gothic/Fracture/German tradition, which Germans used well into the 20th century, and the Italian/Italic/Antiqua/Latin tradition, still used. For some nations the integration into Europe meant giving up older scripts, e.g. the Germanic gave up the runes (Futhark) (3rd to 17th centuries), the Irish the Ogham script (4th to 7th centuries). The Cyrillic script is the second most widespread alphabet in Europe, and was developed in the 9th century under the influence of the Greek, Latin and Glagolitic alphabets. Both the Latin and Cyrillic alphabets are used for multiple languages in multiple states, both inside and outside Europe. As well as these two, there are three alphabets used primarily for a single language, although they are occasionally applied to minority languages in the states from which they originate. The oldest of these alphabets is the Greek alphabet, which could be considered the progenitor of all the surviving alphabets of Europe, with the earliest recorded inscriptions appearing in the 9th century BC. The other two are both found in the Caucasus, both originating in the 5th century. The Georgian alphabet is used primarily to write Georgian, though it is also used to write the other Kartvelian languages, Svan, Mingrelian and Laz, all of which are found largely within the borders of Georgia. The Armenian alphabet is used to write the Armenian language, which has two dialects, and has been used to write Turkish in the past.\n\nThe sound systems of languages may differ considerably between languages. European languages can thus rather be characterized negatively, e.g. by the absence of click sounds. One could also think of specific prosodic features, such as tonal accents. But there are also tonal languages in Europe: Serbian and Croatian (e.g. \"lètī\" ‘he flies, is flying’ with long rising accent vs. \"lêta\" ‘years’ with long falling accent) and Slovene (e.g. \"sûda\" ‘of the vessel’ with long falling accent vs. \"súda\" ‘of the court’ with long rising accent). In Slovene, the use of the musical accent is declining though (cf. Rehder 1998: 234) --but there are hardly any contexts where intelligibility is endangered. In Sweden Swedish (but not in Finland Swedish) there also is a pitch accent in some words, which can be meaningful, e.g. \"´anden\" ‘the duck’ vs. \"ˇanden\" ‘the ghost, spirit’.\n\nAs a general introductory remark we can distinguish between three structural types of languages: \nEuropean languages are seldom pure representatives of one type. For (a) Modern English is a good example (and in many way the code oral of French verbs); for (c) Old English and Modern High German are good examples (and in many ways the code écrit of French verb forms); classical representatives of type (b) are Finnish and Hungarian. If a language is not isolating, this does not necessarily mean that it has no word-order rules. Latin, Basque, Finnish and the Slavic languages have a relatively free word order, whereas many languages show more restricted rules. German and Dutch, e.g., show verb-second word-order in main clauses and verb-final order in subordinate clauses. English has subject-verb word-order, which is also preferred by the Romanic languages. Irish and Scottish Gaelic have a basic verb-initial word order.\n\nWe can also distinguish between analytic constructions (with free grammatical morphemes, i.e. grammatical elements as separate words) and synthetic constructions (with bound grammatical morphemes, i.e. grammatical elements attached to or included in a word), e.g. \"the house of the man\" vs. \"the man's house\".\n\nApart from the points already mentioned, the categories of aspect (not always easy to separate from the tense system) and gender are noteworthy. Under the category of aspect linguists basically understand the distinction between perfective actions (activity finished, has led to a result; single event) and imperfective actions (activity not yet finished, w/out information on termination; long duration, repetitive). The Slavic languages have a fine and rigid aspect system; in English there’s the distinction between progressive and non-progressive (simple) and a distinction between present perfect and past; in the Romanic languages the imperfect serves to denote background actions.\n\nThe most current gender systems in Europe are twofold (masculine vs. feminine, e.g. in the Romanic languages, or uter vs. neuter, e.g. in Swedish and Danish); but there are also languages that are threefold (e.g. Slavic, German) or lack grammatical gender at all (e.g. English, Hungarian, Finnish). The problem of gender also concerns the system of personal pronouns. We normally distinguish between three persons singular and three persons plural, but there are also some languages that have specific words for the dual (e.g. Slovene). In the 3rd person singular we often have a distinction according to grammatical gender; in English, though, the choice is determined by natural gender; in Hungarian and Finnish we have no differentiation at all, in the Scandinavian languages on the other hand we have a differentiation that incorporate both grammatical and natural gender. In some languages the grammatical gender is also relevant in the 3rd pl. (e.g. the Romance languages).\n\nWhereas traditionally we group languages according to historical language families (e.g. Indo-European languages, Uralic languages), a more modern way is to look at grammatical features from a synchronic point of view. A certain number of common structural features would then characterize a sprachbund. For Europe, the most prominent sprachbund that we can determine is referred to as SAE (= Standard Average European) or Charlemagne sprachbund. Haspelmath (2001) illustrates that German, Dutch, French, Occitan and Northern Italian are the most central members of this sprachbund. Important features are (cf., e.g., Haspelmath 2001, Heine/Kuteva 2006): \n\nLatin, French and English not only served or still serve as \"linguae francae\" (cf. below), but also influenced the vernacular/national languages due to their high prestige. Due to this prestige, there are not only “necessity loans”, but also “luxury loans” and pseudo-loans. Many loans from these three languages (esp. Neo-Latin with its Greek elements) can be considered internationalisms, although occasionally the meanings vary from one language to another, which might even lead to misunderstandings. Examples: \n\nThree minor source languages for European borrowings are Arabic (esp. in mathematics and science, foreign plants and fruits), Italian (esp. in arts, esp. from the 15th to the 17th centuries), German (esp. in arts, education, mining, trading from the 12th to the 20th centuries with alternating importance).\n\nAs far as the structuring or “wording” of the world is concerned changes occur relatively fast due to progresses in knowledge, sociopolitical changes etc. Lexical items that seem more conservative are proverbs and metaphorical idioms. Many European proverbs and idioms go back to Antiquity and the Bible, some originate in national stories and were spread over other languages via Latin. A typical European proverb to express that there is no profit without working can be paraphrased as “Roasted pigeons/larks/sparrows/geese/chickens/birds don’t fly into one’s mouth”, e.g. Cz. \"Pečeni ptáci nelítají do huby (birds!)\" = Dan. \"Stegte duer flyve ingen i munden (pigeon!)\" = ndl. \"De gebraden duiven vliegen je niet in de mond (pigeons!)\" = E. \"He thinks that larks will fall into his mouth roasted\" = Finn. \"Ei paistetut varpuset suuhun lennä (sparrows!)\" = Fr. \"Les alouettes ne vous tombent pas toutes rôties dans le bec (larks!)\" = G. \"Gebratene Tauben fliegen einem nicht ins Maul (pigeon!)\" = Hungar. \"Senkinek nem repül a szájába a sült galamb (pigeon!)\" = Lith. \"Keptas karvelis neatlėks pats i burną (pigeon!)\" = Latv. \"Cepts zvirbulis no jumta mutē nekrīt (sparrow!)\" = (Nynorsk) Norw. \"Det kjem ikkje steikte fuglar fljugande i munnen (bird!)\" = Pol. \"Pieczone gołąbki nie przydą same do gąbki (pigeons!)\" = Slovak \"Nech nik nečaká, že mu pečené holuby budú padať do úst (pigeons!)\" = Slovene \"Pečeni golobje ne lete nobenemu v usta [pigeons!] = Swed. Stekta sparvar flyger inte in i munnen (sparrows!)\".\n\nIn Geert Hofstede’s terms Europe can, to a large extent, be considered an individualistic civilization (i.e. a rather direct and analytic style is preferred, important points are mentioned before an explanation or illustration in an argument, decisions are based on compromise or the majority’s vote); in contrast, the Sinic (Chinese), Japanese, Arabic and Hindu (Indian) civilizations are collectivistic (i.e. a rather indirect and synthetic style is used, explanations and illustrations are mentioned before the essential point of an argument, decisions are reached through consent). We can further make Edward Hall’s distinction between “low context” communication (i.e. direct style, person-oriented, self-projection, loquacity) and “high context” communication (i.e. indirect style, status-oriented, reservation, silence). Most European nations use “low context” communication.\n\nWhat are some specific features of European communication strategies? \n\nEurope’s history is characterized by three linguae francae:\n\nLinguae francae that were less widespread, but still played a comparatively important role in European history are:\n\nThe first type of dictionaries are glossaries, i.e. more or less structured lists of lexical pairs (in alphabetical order or according to conceptual fields). The Latin-German (Latin-Bavarian) Abrogans is among the first. A new wave of lexicography can be seen from the late 15th century onwards (after the introduction of the printing press, with the growing interest for standardizing languages).\n\nIn the Middle Ages the two most important definitory elements of Europe were \"Christianitas\" and \"Latinitas\". Thus language—at least the supranational language—played an elementary role. This changed with the spread of the national languages in official contexts and the rise of a national feeling. Among other things, this led to projects of standardizing national language and gave birth to a number of language academies (e.g. 1582 Accademia della Crusca in Florence, 1617 Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft, 1635 Académie française, 1713 Real Academia de la Lengua in Madrid). “Language” was then (and still is today) more connected with “nation” than with “civilization” (particularly in France). “Language” was also used to create a feeling of “religious/ethnic identity” (e.g. different Bible translations by Catholics and Protestants of the same language).\n\nAmong the first standardization discussions and processes are the ones for Italian (“questione della lingua”: Modern Tuscan/Florentine vs. Old Tuscan/Florentine vs. Venetian > Modern Florentine + archaic Tuscan + Upper Italian), French (standard is based on Parisian), English (standard is based on the London dialect) and (High) German (based on: chancellery of Meißen/Saxony + Middle German + chancellery of Prague/Bohemia [“Common German”]). But also a number of other nations began to look for and develop a standard variety in the 16th century.\n\nDespite the importance of English as an international lingua franca also in Europe, Europe can be associated with its linguistic diversity, which also includes the special protection of minority languages, e.g. by the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages founded in the 1990s. This underlines that the popular view of “one nation = one language” (cf. Wirrer 2003) is mostly false.\n\nA minority language can be defined as a language used by a group that defines itself as an ethnic minority group, whereby the language of this group is typologically different and not a dialect of the standard language. For several years now, Jan Wirrer has been working on the status of minority languages in Europe (cf., e.g., Wirrer 2000 and 2003). In Europe—e.g. thanks to the European Charter of Regional and Minority Language—some languages are in quite a strong position, in the sense that they are given special status, such as Basque, Irish, Welsh/Cymraeg, Catalan, Rhaeto-Romance/Romansh and Romani, native language of the Roma/Gypsies in southern Europe), whereas others are in a rather weak position (e.g. Frisian, Scottish Gaelic, Turkish, Saami/Lappish, Sorbian/Wendish and Yiddish, the once common language of Ashkenazi Jews in Eastern Europe). Especially allochthonous minority languages are not given official status in the EU.\n\nSome minor languages don’t even have a standard yet, i.e. they have not even reached the level of an ausbausprache yet, which could be changed, e.g., if these languages were given official status. (cf. also next section).\n\nFrance is the origin of two laws, or decrees, concerning language: the Ordonnance de Villers-Cotterêts (1239), which says that every document in France should be written in French (i.e. not in Latin nor Occitan) and the French Loi Toubon, which aims at eliminating Anglicisms from official documents. But a characteristic feature of Europe is linguistic diversity and tolerance, which is not only shown by the European Charta of Regional and Minority Languages. An illustrative proof of the promotion of linguistic diversity in the Middle Ages is the translation school in Toledo, Spain, founded in the 12th century (in medieval Toledo the Christian, the Jewish and the Arab civilizations lived together remarkably peacefully).\n\nThis tolerant linguistic attitude is also the reason why the EU’s general rule is that every official national language is also an official EU language. However, Letzebuergish/Luxemburgish is not an official EU language, because there are also other (stronger) official languages with “EU status” in that country. Several concepts for an EU language policy are being debated: \n\n\n"}

{"id": "216965", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=216965", "title": "Flinders Petrie", "text": "Flinders Petrie\n\nSir William Matthew Flinders Petrie, FRS, FBA (3 June 1853 – 28 July 1942), commonly known as Flinders Petrie, was an English Egyptologist and a pioneer of systematic methodology in archaeology and preservation of artifacts. He held the first chair of Egyptology in the United Kingdom, and excavated many of the most important archaeological sites in Egypt in conjunction with his wife, Hilda Petrie. Some consider his most famous discovery to be that of the Merneptah Stele, an opinion with which Petrie himself concurred.\n\nPetrie developed the system of dating layers based on pottery and ceramic findings.\n\nPetrie was born on 3 June 1853 in Maryon Road, Charlton, Kent, England, the son of William Petrie (1821–1908) and Anne (née Flinders) (1812–1892). Anne was the daughter of Captain Matthew Flinders, who led the first circumnavigation of Australia. William Petrie was an electrical engineer who developed carbon arc lighting and later developed chemical processes for Johnson, Matthey & Co.\n\nPetrie was raised in a Christian household (his father being a member of the Plymouth Brethren), and was educated at home. He had no formal education. His father taught his son how to survey accurately, laying the foundation for his archaeological career. At the age of eight, he was tutored in French, Latin, and Greek, until he had a collapse and was taught at home. He also ventured his first archaeological opinion aged eight, when friends visiting the Petrie family were describing the unearthing of the Brading Roman Villa in the Isle of Wight. The boy was horrified to hear the rough shovelling out of the contents, and protested that the earth should be pared away, inch by inch, to see all that was in it and how it lay. \"All that I have done since,\" he wrote when he was in his late seventies, \"was there to begin with, so true it is that we can only develop what is born in the mind. I was already in archaeology by nature.\"\n\nThe chair of Edwards Professor of Egyptian Archaeology and Philology at University College London was set up and funded in 1892 following a bequest from Amelia Edwards, who died suddenly in that year. Petrie's supporter since 1880, Edwards had instructed that he should be its first incumbent. He continued to excavate in Egypt after taking up the professorship, training many of the best archaeologists of the day.\n\nIn 1913 Petrie sold his large collection of Egyptian antiquities to University College, London, where it is now housed in the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology. One of his trainees, Howard Carter, went on to discover the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922.\n\nIn his teenage years, Petrie surveyed British prehistoric monuments (commencing with the late Romano-British 'British Camp' that lay within yards of his family home in Charlton) in attempts to understand their geometry (at 19 producing the most accurate survey of Stonehenge). His father had corresponded with Piazzi Smyth about his theories of the Great Pyramid and Petrie travelled to Egypt in early 1880 to make an accurate survey of Giza, making him the first to properly investigate how they were constructed (many theories had been advanced on this, and Petrie read them all, but none were based on first hand observation or logic).\n\nPetrie's published reports of this triangulation survey, and his analysis of the architecture of Giza therein, was exemplary in its methodology and accuracy, disproved Smyth's theories and still provides much of the basic data regarding the pyramid plateau to this day. On that visit, he was appalled by the rate of destruction of monuments (some listed in guidebooks had been worn away completely since then) and mummies. He described Egypt as \"a house on fire, so rapid was the destruction\" and felt his duty to be that of a \"salvage man, to get all I could, as quickly as possible and then, when I was 60, I would sit and write it all.\"\n\nReturning to England at the end of 1880, Petrie wrote a number of articles and then met Amelia Edwards, journalist and patron of the Egypt Exploration Fund (now the Egypt Exploration Society), who became his strong supporter and later appointed him as Professor at her Egyptology chair at University College London. Impressed by his scientific approach, they offered him work as the successor to Édouard Naville. Petrie accepted the position and was given the sum of £250 per month to cover the excavation's expenses. In November 1884, Petrie arrived in Egypt to begin his excavations.\n\nHe first went to a New Kingdom site at Tanis, with 170 workmen. He cut out the middle man role of foreman on this and all subsequent excavations, taking complete overall control himself and removing pressure on the workmen from the foreman to discover finds quickly but sloppily. Though he was regarded as an amateur and dilettante by more established Egyptologists, this made him popular with his workers, who found several small but significant finds that would have been lost under the old system.\nIn 1886, while working for the Egypt Exploration Fund, Petrie excavated at Tell Nebesheh in the Eastern Nile Delta. This site is located 8 miles southeast of Tanis and, among the remains of an ancient temple there, Petrie found a royal sphinx, now located at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.\n\nBy the end of the Tanis dig, he ran out of funding but, reluctant to leave the country in case it was renewed, he spent 1887 cruising the Nile taking photographs as a less subjective record than sketches. During this time, he also climbed rope ladders at Sehel Island near Aswan to draw and photograph thousands of early Egyptian inscriptions on a cliff face, recording embassies to Nubia, famines and wars. By the time he reached Aswan, a telegram had reached there to confirm the renewal of his funding. He then went straight to the burial site at Fayum, particularly interested in post-30 BC burials, which had not previously been fully studied. He found intact tombs and 60 of the famous portraits, and discovered from inscriptions on the mummies that they were kept with their living families for generations before burial. Under Auguste Mariette's arrangements, he sent 50% of these portraits to the Egyptian department of antiquities.\n\nHowever, when he later found that Gaston Maspero placed little value on them and left them open to the elements in a yard behind the museum to deteriorate, he angrily demanded that they all be returned, forcing Maspero to pick the 12 best examples for the museum to keep and return 48 to Petrie, who sent them to London for a special showing at the British Museum. Resuming work, he discovered the village of the Pharaonic tomb-workers.\n\nIn 1890, Petrie made the first of his many forays into Palestine, leading to much important archaeological work. His six-week excavation of Tell el-Hesi (which was mistakenly identified as Lachish) that year represents the first scientific excavation of an archaeological site in the Holy Land. Petrie surveyed a group of tombs in the Wadi al-Rababah (the biblical Hinnom) of Jerusalem, largely dating to the Iron Age and early Roman periods. Here, in these ancient monuments, Petrie discovered two different metrical systems.\n\nFrom 1891, he worked on the temple of Aten at Tell-el-Amarna, discovering a New Kingdom painted pavement of garden and animals and hunting scenes. This became a tourist attraction but, as there was no direct access to the site, tourists wrecked neighbouring fields on their way to it. This made local farmers deface the paintings, and it is only thanks to Petrie's copies that their original appearance is known.\n\nIn early 1896, Petrie and his archaeological team were conducting excavations on a temple in Petrie's area of concession at Luxor. This temple complex was located just north of the original funerary temple of Amenhotep III which had been built on a flood plain. They were initially surprised that this building which they were excavating:\n\nDuring the field season of 1895/6, at the Ramesseum, Petrie and the young German Egyptologist Wilhelm Spiegelberg became friends. Spiegelberg was in charge of the edition of many texts discovered by his British colleague, and Petrie offered important collections of artefacts to the University of Strasbourg. In 1897, the Kaiser-Wilhelms-Universität Straßburg gratefully conferred to Petrie the title of doctor honoris causa, and in June 1902 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS).\n\nIn 1923, Petrie was knighted for services to British archaeology and Egyptology. The focus of his work shifted permanently to Palestine in 1926 (although he did become interested in early Egypt, in 1928 digging a cemetery at Luxor that proved so huge that he devised an entirely new excavation system, including comparison charts for finds, which is still used today). He began excavating several important sites in the south-west of Palestine, including Tell el-Jemmeh and Tell el-Ajjul.\n\nIn 1933, on retiring from his professorship, he moved permanently to Jerusalem, where he lived with Lady Petrie at the British School of Archaeology, then temporarily headquartered at the American School of Oriental Research (today the W. F. Albright Institute of Archaeological Research).\n\nPetrie died in Jerusalem on 28 July 1942. His body was interred in the Protestant Cemetery on Mount Zion, but he donated his head (and thus his brain) to the Royal College of Surgeons of London. World War II was then at its height, and the head was delayed in transit. After being stored in a jar in the college basement, its label fell off and no one knew who the head belonged to. However, it was eventually identified, and is now stored, but not displayed, at the Royal College of Surgeons.\n\nPetrie married Hilda Urlin (1871–1957) in London on 26 November 1896. The couple had two children, John (1907–1972) and Ann (1909–1989). The family originally lived in Hampstead, where an English Heritage blue plaque has been placed on the building they lived in, 5 Cannon Place. John Flinders Petrie became a noted mathematician, who gave his name to the Petrie polygon.\n\nPetrie's painstaking recording and study of artifacts set new standards in archaeology. He wrote: \"I believe the true line of research lies in the noting and comparison of the smallest details.\" By linking styles of pottery with periods, he was the first to use seriation in Egyptology, a new method for establishing the chronology of a site. Flinders Petrie was also responsible for mentoring and training a whole generation of Egyptologists, including Howard Carter. After his death, his wife, Hilda Petrie created a student travel scholarship to Egypt on the Centennial of Petrie's birth in 1953.\n\nMany thousands of artefacts recovered during excavations led by Petrie can be found in museums worldwide.\n\nPetrie remains a controversial figure for his pro-eugenics views and opinions on other social topics, which spilled over into his disputes with the British Museum's Egyptology expert, E. A. Wallis Budge. Budge's contention that the religion of the Egyptians was essentially identical to the religions of the people of northeastern and central Africa was regarded by his colleagues as impossible, since all but a few followed Petrie in his contention that the culture of Ancient Egypt was derived from an invading Caucasoid \"Dynastic Race\" which had conquered Egypt in late prehistory and introduced the Pharaonic culture. Petrie was a dedicated follower of eugenics, believing that there was no such thing as cultural or social innovation in human society, but rather that all social change is the result of biological change, such as migration and foreign conquest resulting in interbreeding. Petrie claimed that his \"Dynastic Race\", in which he never ceased to believe, was a \"fine\" Caucasoid race that entered Egypt from the south in late predynastic times, conquered the \"inferior\" and \"exhausted\" \"mulatto\" race then inhabiting Egypt, and slowly introduced the finer Dynastic civilisation as they interbred with the inferior indigenous people. Petrie, who was also affiliated with a variety of far right-wing groups and anti-democratic thought in England and was a dedicated believer in the superiority of the Northern peoples over the Latinate and Southern peoples, derided Budge's belief that the ancient Egyptians were an African people with roots in eastern Africa as impossible and \"unscientific\", as did his followers.\n\nHis involvement in Palestinian archaeology was examined in the exhibition \"A Future for the Past: Petrie's Palestinian Collection\".\n\nThe Petrie Medal was created in celebration of Petrie's seventieth birthday, when funds were raised to commission and produce 20 medals to be awarded \"once in every three years for distinguished work in Archaeology, preferably to a British subject\". The first medal was awarded to Petrie himself (1925), and the first few recipients included Sir Aurel Stein (1928), Sir Arthur Evans (1931), Abbé Henri Breuil (1934), Prof J.D. Beazley (1937), Sir Mortimer Wheeler (1950), Prof J.B. Wace (1953), Sir Leonard Woolley (1957).\n\nA number of Petrie's discoveries were presented to the Royal Archaeological Society and described in the society's \"Archaeological Journal\" by his good friend and fellow archaeologist Flaxman Charles John Spurrell. Petrie published a total of 97 books.\n\n\n\n"}

Lewis Carroll wrote \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\" for Henry Liddell's daughter Alice.\n\nLiddell received his education at Charterhouse and Christ Church, Oxford. He gained a double first degree in 1833, then became a college tutor, and was ordained in 1838.\n\nLiddell was Headmaster of Westminster School from 1846 to 1855. Meanwhile, his life work, the great lexicon (based on the German work of Franz Passow), which he and Robert Scott began as early as 1834, had made good progress, and the first edition of \"Liddell and Scott's Lexicon\" appeared in 1843. It immediately became the standard Greek–English dictionary, with the 8th edition published in 1897.\n\nAs Headmaster of Westminster Liddell enjoyed a period of great success, followed by trouble due to the outbreak of fever and cholera in the school. In 1855 he accepted the deanery of Christ Church, Oxford. In the same year he brought out his \"History of Ancient Rome\" and took a very active part in the first Oxford University Commission. His tall figure, fine presence and aristocratic mien were for many years associated with all that was characteristic of Oxford life. Coming just at the transition period when the \"old Christ Church,\" which Pusey strove so hard to preserve, was inevitably becoming broader and more liberal, it was chiefly due to Liddell that necessary changes were effected with the minimum of friction. \n\nIn 1859 Liddell welcomed the then Prince of Wales when he matriculated at Christ Church, being the first holder of that title who had matriculated since Henry V. While Liddell was Dean of Christ Church, he arranged for the building of a new choir school and classrooms for the staff and pupils of Christ Church Cathedral School on its present site. Before then the school was housed within Christ Church itself.\n\nIn July 1846, Liddell married Lorina Reeve (1826-1910), with whom he had nine children including Alice Liddell (1852-1934) of Lewis Carroll fame.\n\nIn conjunction with Sir Henry Acland, Liddell did much to encourage the study of art at Oxford, and his taste and judgment gained him the admiration and friendship of Ruskin. In 1891, owing to advancing years, he resigned the deanery. The last years of his life were spent at Ascot, where he died on 18 January 1898. Two roads in Ascot, Liddell Way and Carroll Crescent honour the relationship between Henry Liddell and Lewis Carroll.\n\nLiddell was an Oxford \"character\" in later years. He figures in contemporary undergraduate doggerel:\n\nThe Victorian journalist, George W. E. Russell (1853–1919), conveys something of Liddell's image:\n\nHis father was Henry Liddell, Rector of Easington (1787–1872), the younger son of Sir Henry Liddell, 5th Baronet (1749–1791) and the former Elizabeth Steele. His father's elder brother, Sir Thomas Liddell, 6th Baronet (1775–1855), was raised to the Peerage as Baron Ravensworth in 1821.\n\nHis mother was the former Charlotte Lyon (1785–1871), a daughter of Thomas Lyon (1741–1796) (who was the youngest son of the 8th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne) and the former Mary Wren (died 1811).\n\nOn 2 July 1846, Henry married Lorina Reeve (3 March 1826 – 25 June 1910).

They are special cases of more general recursive fixpoint queries, which compute transitive closures.\n\nIn standard hierarchical queries are implemented by way of recursive \"common table expressions\" (CTEs). Unlike Oracle's earlier connect-by clause, recursive CTEs were designed with fixpoint semantics from the beginning. Recursive CTEs from the standard were relatively close to the existing implementation in IBM DB2 version 2. Recursive CTEs are also supported by Microsoft SQL Server (since SQL Server 2008 R2), Firebird 2.1, PostgreSQL 8.4+, SQLite 3.8.3+, IBM Informix version 11.50+, CUBRID and MySQL 8.0.1+. Tableau and TIBCO Spotfire do not support CTEs, while Oracle 11g Release 2's implementation lacks fixpoint semantics.\n\nWithout common table expressions or connected-by clauses it is possible to achieve hierarchical queries with user-defined recursive functions.\n\nA common table expression, or CTE, (in SQL) is a temporary named result set, derived from a simple query and defined within the execution scope of a codice_1, codice_2, codice_3, or codice_4 statement.\n\nCTEs can be thought of as alternatives to derived tables (subquery), views, and inline user-defined functions.\n\nCommon table expressions are supported by Teradata, DB2, Firebird, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle (with recursion since 11g release 2), PostgreSQL (since 8.4), MariaDB (since 10.2), MySQL (since 8.0), SQLite (since 3.8.3), HyperSQL and H2 (experimental). Oracle calls CTEs \"subquery factoring\".\n\nThe syntax for a recursive CTE is as follows:\n\nwhere codice_5‘s syntax is:\n\nRecursive CTEs (or \"recursive subquery factoring\" in Oracle jargon) can be used to traverse relations (as graphs or trees) although the syntax is much more involved because there are no automatic pseudo-columns created (like codice_6 above); if these are desired, they have to be created in the code. See MSDN documentation or IBM documentation for tutorial examples.\n\nThe codice_7 keyword is not usually needed after WITH in systems other than PostgreSQL.\n\nIn SQL:1999 a recursive (CTE) query may appear anywhere a query is allowed. It's possible, for example, to name the result using codice_8 [codice_7] codice_10. Using a CTE inside an codice_11, one can populate a table with data generated from a recursive query; random data generation is possible using this technique without using any procedural statements.\n\nSome Databases, like PostgreSQL, support a shorter CREATE RECURSIVE VIEW format which is internally translated into WITH RECURSIVE coding.\n\nAn example of a recursive query computing the factorial of numbers from 0 to 9 is the following:\n\nAn alternative syntax is the non-standard codice_12 construct; it was introduced by Oracle in the 1980s. Prior to Oracle 10g, the construct was only useful for traversing acyclic graphs because it returned an error on detecting any cycles; in version 10g Oracle introduced the NOCYCLE feature (and keyword), making the traversal work in the presence of cycles as well.\n\ncodice_12 is supported by EnterpriseDB, Oracle database, CUBRID, IBM Informix and DB2 although only if it is enabled as a compatibility mode. The syntax is as follows:\n\n\nThe output from the above query would look like:\n\n\nThe following example returns the last name of each employee in department 10, each manager above that employee in the hierarchy, the number of levels between manager and employee, and the path between the two:\n\n\n\nAcademic textbooks.

He was generally known as Horace, to distinguish him from his Uncle Horatio, after whom he was named.\n\nMoule was born on 30 May 1832 at Fordington, Dorset, where his father was vicar. In 1851 he entered Trinity College, Oxford, but left without a degree; in 1854 he entered Queens' College, Cambridge, but did not get a B.A. until 1867 and an M.A. in 1873. He did, however, win the Hulsean Prize in 1858.\n\nHe spent a brief spell as an assistant master at Marlborough College, and then became a government inspector of workhouses.\n\nMoule appears to have suffered from depression and alcoholism, and his life and death were shaped by these character traits; one of his pupils recorded in his diary that Horace was 'a dipsomaniac-and that he was suffering from D.T'.\n\nOn 21 September 1873, when deeply depressed and affected by alcohol, he ended a three-hour conversation at Queens' with his brother Charles and went to bed. Minutes later Charles, writing in an adjoining room, heard what he described as a \"trickling\" sound and went to investigate.

{"id": "80818", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=80818", "title": "IANAL", "text": "IANAL\n\nIANAL is a Usenet and chat abbreviation (initialism) for the expansion \"I am not a lawyer\". The expansion may be used by non-lawyers who are seeking to avoid accusations of unauthorized practice of law and are not making any recommendation to the particular addressee of their remarks.\n\nA related abbreviation, TINLA, stands for \"This is not legal advice.\" One or both of these expansions often precede opinions about law. The use of these expansions serves as a warning for the reader not to take the opinion as professional legal advice. Many jurisdictions have legal restrictions on actually giving or even appearing to give legal advice, or otherwise practicing as a lawyer without legal qualifications and official registration. Rendition of legal advice by a person who is not licensed to do so can be the basis for a charge of unauthorized practice of law.\n\nThe term appears to be inspired by a 1980s commercial for Vicks Formula 44 cough syrup, in which two spokesmen successively pitched the over-the-counter medication with the line: \"I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV.\" The spokesmen were soap opera actors Chris Robinson (who played Dr. Rick Webber on \"General Hospital\") and Peter Bergman (who played Dr. Cliff Warner on \"All My Children\"). The transfer from \"doctor\" to \"lawyer\" is an example of a snowclone. The term IANAL is reported to have been common on Usenet by the late 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nA variant of IANAL is IANYL (\"I am not \"your\" lawyer\"). The term may be used by a lawyer posting comments on a message board to indicate that the commentator is, in fact, a lawyer, but to emphasize that the commentator does not represent the reader, and to indicate that the comments are not protected by attorney–client privilege and that the commenter disclaims any malpractice or other tort liability should the suggestion be followed with undesirable results. IAAL (\"I am a lawyer\") is sometimes used as well, usually with an explicit disclaimer such as \"IAAL, but I'm not your lawyer\".\n\nThe case law standard for determining what comments cross the line is generally \"the application of law to facts specific to an individual seeking legal advice\". Attorneys may use a disclaimer to reduce confusion, and \"I am not your lawyer\" is part of a typical disclaimer. There are \"weighty obligations\" that go along with the creation of a lawyer–client relationship, particularly if an \"online exchange includes legal advice relating to the client's specific facts\". Courts have held that (in the case of 900 numbers) boilerplate disclaimers without clear actions to indicate assent may not avoid the creation of a lawyer–client relationship.\n\nVariations of IANAL can be applied to different fields, such as IANAMD for \"I am not a Medical Doctor\" or IANAP for \"I am not a physicist\" These expansions serve the same general purpose as IANALto discourage the use of the information as professional advice.\n\n\n"}

It is designed to cover every economic sector and virtually every activity of the humankind where technical standards may be used.\n\nDeveloped and maintained by the International Organization for Standardization, the ICS is intended to be a continuous work in progress and is updated when necessary. The latest edition of the ICS can be downloaded free of charge from the ISO web site.\n\nAnyone may submit a proposal for modifications or additions to the ICS.\n\nThe ICS serves as a structure for catalogues and databases of technical standards and other normative documents, and as a basis for standing-order systems for international, regional and national standards.\n\nThe ICS uses an hierarchical classification, which consists of three nested levels called \"fields\" (Level 1), \"groups\" (Level 2) and \"sub-groups\" (Level 3). Each \"field\" is subdivided into \"groups\", which are further divided into \"sub-groups\".\n\nAll classification levels are designated by a classification code (called \"notation\") and a title. The notation is a set of Arabic numerals.\n\nTop-level items, which have no parent levels, use a two-digit notation, for example:\n\nThe notations for \"groups\" and \"sub-groups\" include the parent-level notations. The example below shows a notation for Sub-Group 20 (Level 3), which belongs to Group 040 (Level 2) in Field 43 (Level 1). \n\nA \"field\" is the first level in the International Classification for Standards. It may represent one or a combination of the following:\n\nAt present the classification includes 40 \"fields\".\n\nThe ICS second level, the \"group\", is a subdivision of the \"field\".\n\n\"Sub-groups\" are used in the ICS to subdivide \"groups\" into subjects that certain to a particular aspect of the subject covered by a given \"group\". Regardless of the subject, virtually all \"groups\" include a \"sub-group\" No. 01 that covers the complete subject of the respective \"group\". In addition, most of the \"groups\" contain a \"sub-group\" No. 99 for standards on subjects which do not correspond either to the subjects of the general \"sub-groups\" or to the subjects of the specific \"sub-groups\" of the respective \"groups\".\n\nLevel 4 subdivisions are not part of the official ICS document. The ICS rules however allow users of the classification system to subdivide the official ICS \"sub-groups\" into so-called \"units\", making them a Level 4 component of the International Classification for Standards. This is accomplished by adding a two-digit number to the notation of the \"sub-group\" being subdivided. However, instead of a period, new notations use a hyphen as a separator.

The sign must be displayed on the rear of the vehicle. The sign may either be placed separately from the registration plate, or be incorporated into the vehicle registration plate.\n\nThe allocation of codes is maintained by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe as the \"Distinguishing Signs Used on Vehicles in International Traffic\" (sometimes abbreviated to DSIT), authorised by the UN's Geneva Convention on Road Traffic of 1949 and the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968. Many vehicle codes created since the adoption of ISO 3166 coincide with ISO two- or three-letter codes.\n\nThe 2004 South-East Asian \"Agreement ... for the Facilitation of Cross-Border Transport of Goods and People\" uses a mixture of ISO and DSIT codes: Myanmar uses MYA, China CHN, and Cambodia KH (ISO codes), Thailand uses T (DSIT code), Laos LAO, and Vietnam VN (coincident ISO and DSIT codes).\n\nThe Vienna Convention on Road Traffic was concluded in Vienna on 8 November 1968. Since its entry into force on 21 May 1977, in signatory countries it replaces previous road traffic conventions, notably the 1949 Geneva Convention on Road Traffic, in accordance with its Article 48. One of the main benefits of the convention for motorists is the obligation on signatory countries to recognize the legality of vehicles from other signatory countries. When driving in other signatory countries, the distinguishing sign of the country of registration must be displayed on the rear of the vehicle. The sign may either be placed separately from the registration plate as a white oval plate or sticker, or be incorporated in the vehicle registration plate. When the distinguishing sign is incorporated in the registration plate, it must also appear on the front registration plate of the vehicle.\nThe requirement to display a separate distinguishing sign is not necessary within the European Economic Area, for vehicles with license plates in the common EU format which satisfy the requirements of the Vienna Convention, and so are also valid in non-EU countries signatory to the convention. Separate signs are also not needed for Canada, Mexico and the United States, where the province, state or district of registration is usually embossed or surface-printed on the vehicle registration plate.\n\n\n\nThere are unofficial codes in common use, such as \"CYM\" for Wales, \"BZH\" for Brittany, \"VL\" for Flanders, \"V\" for Vojvodina/Vajdaság, \"TS\" for Transylvania,\"PR\" for Puerto Rico, \"SIC\" for Székely Land (from Latin \"Terra Siculorum\") and \"CD\" for \"Corps Diplomatique\".\n\nIn addition, in some areas, vehicle-style stickers have been used to denote and promote other entities, such as towns, islands, businesses, and even associations. These irregular stickers almost always bear an explanation of the code in small print near the edge of the sticker, as the codes used are so unknown.\n\nA separate system is used for vehicles belonging to the diplomats of foreign countries with license plate from the host country. That system is host country-specific and varies largely from country to country. For example TR on a diplomatic car in the USA indicates Italian, not Turkish. Such markings in Norway are indicated with numbers only, again different from international standards (e.g. 90 means Slovakian.\n\n\n"}

Despite the name, the series covers important sources for the history of many countries besides Germany, since the Society for the Publication of Sources on Germanic Affairs of the Middle Ages has included documents from many other areas subjected to the influence of Germanic tribes or rulers (Britain, Czech lands, Poland, Austria, France, Low Countries, Italy, Spain, etc.). The editor from 1826 until 1874 was Georg Heinrich Pertz (1795–1876); in 1875 he was succeeded by Georg Waitz (1813-1886) .\n\nThe MGH was founded in Hanover as a private text publication society by the Prussian reformer Heinrich Friedrich Karl Freiherr vom Stein in 1819. The first volume appeared in 1826. The editor from 1826 until 1874 was Georg Heinrich Pertz, who was succeeded by Georg Waitz. Many eminent medievalists from Germany and, eventually, other countries, joined in the project of searching out and comparing manuscripts and producing scholarly editions. The motto chosen, \"Sanctus amor patriae dat animum\" (\"Holy love for the fatherland gives the spirit\") is explained as linking Romantic nationalism with professional scholarship. In 1875, the MGH was established as a more formal institution with headquarters in Berlin. \n\nIn 1935, the organization was taken over by the state and renamed the \"Reichsinstitut für ältere deutsche Geschichtskunde\" (National Institute for Older German History). This was abolished in 1945, at the end of World War II. \n\nHowever, the institute was subsequently revived under its original name with the support of German institutions and the Austrian Academy of Sciences. The Monumenta Germaniae Historica Institute has been located in Munich since 1949 and possesses a large specialized library on the medieval history of Germany and Europe, including Church history, along with 130,000 monographs and approximately 150,000 dependent writings. It moved into its current premises in the building of the Bavarian State Library in 1967.\n\nThe project, a major effort of historical scholarship, continues in the 21st century. In 2004 the MGH, with the support of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, made all of its publications in print for more than five years available online, in photo-digital reproduction, via a link on the MGH homepage.\n\nThe series falls into five main divisions, \"Antiquitates\", \"Diplomata\", \"Epistolae\", \"Leges\" and \"Scriptores\", with an additional smaller division of \"Necrologia\". Many subsidiary series have also been established, including a series of more compact volumes for school use (\"Scriptores in usum scholarum\") and special studies (\"MGH Schriften\").\n\n\n\n"}

Regarded as a seminal work on anatomy, this volume led to Tyson being known as the father of comparative anatomy. The book characterizes in detail the anatomy of a creature described as a \"pygmy\" (later known as a chimpanzee) and contains Tyson's views on the phylogeny of the pygmy and its relationship to humans, apes, and monkeys.\n\nThe use of the phrase \"orang-outang\" does not refer to members of the orangutan genus \"Pongo\", but rather uses the phrase to refer to the habitat of the subject; that is, a \"person of the forest\" (\"orangutan\" translates from Malay as \"person of the forest/jungle\".) Due to the absence of previous literature concerning chimpanzees, it is not clear whether or not the titular subject was a bonobo, \"Pan paniscus\", or a common chimpanzee, \"Pan troglodytes\", as there was not great prior distinction between the two. Following his summary of the anatomy of the subject, Tyson attaches fours essays concerning the ancients' knowledge of pygmies, cynocephali, satyrs, and sphinges.\n\nThe book was originally published in 1699 and was republished in 1894 with an introduction which contains a biography of Edward Tyson by Bertram C. A. Windle. Large portions of the book are block quotations in Latin of works from antiquity regarding the anatomy and socialization of the pygmy, much of which Tyson regarded as inaccurate myths and hearsay.\n\nThe letter of dedication is addressed to John Sommers, a Lord High Chancellor of England and President of the Royal Society. The letter thanks him for his dedication to the advancement of knowledge, specifically \"experimental natural philosophy\".\n\nThe preface consists of Tyson giving his reasons for conducting the study, \"to find out the truth, than to enlarge in the mythology; to inform the judgement, than to please the fancy\". He also laments his inability to compare his findings directly to apes and monkeys, instead having to rely on the works of others, such as Aristotle, Pliny, Galen, and Vesalius. Lastly he apologizes in advance for any mistakes on his part within the book.\n\nThe book itself is roughly divided into three parts containing Tyson's findings from his dissection of the pygmy and his comparison to previous findings, many of which are in Latin or Greek.\n\nTyson summarizes his observations on the external and internal anatomy of the pygmy, making note of their similarity or differences to humans. Most often he finds that the pygmy is different and \"inferior\" to humans, which is typical of the anthropocentrism of the time. Much of the text where he addresses previous findings are in Latin or Greek, although he does give explanations for why these authors' drew the conclusions they did, and why they are different or similar from his, in English.\n\nThis section is further subdivided into five sections, with much of the text being in Latin or Greek.\nThis section is not divided, but addresses the musculature of the pygmy from head to feet.\n\nHere Tyson gives the reader two lists, the first how the pygmy is more like a man than an ape, and the second how the pygmy is more like an ape than a man.\n\nA list of features Tyson found present in the pygmy which are more similar to a human than to an ape or a monkey; the terms use modern, common, anatomical terms which may differ from what is found in the book, but have been changed to ease the readers' understanding.\n\n\nA list of features Tyson found were more similar between the pygmy and the ape and monkey, and less similar to a human.\n\n"}

Typically, they are mailed, faxed, or e-mailed to assignment editors and journalists at newspapers, magazines, radio stations, online media, television stations or television networks.\n\nTechnically, anything deliberately sent to a reporter or media source is considered a press release: it is information released by the act of being sent to the media. However, public relations professionals often follow a standard format that they believe is efficient and increases their odds of getting the publicity they desire. The format is supposed to help journalists separate press releases from other PR communication methods, such as pitch letters or media advisories. Generally, a PR body consists of 4 to 5 paragraphs with word limit ranging from 400 to 500. However, press releases can be anywhere from 300 to 800 words\n\nAs the internet has gained prevalence, the way journalists like to be approached has also changed. A format suggested by Kristen Nicole, a former Mashable writer who is now the Senior Managing Editor of SiliconANGLE.com. is sending one sentence as to why this story works for my publication, and 5 bullet points for context. Kristen also recommends pitching writers directly over pitching editors saying: \n\n\"I’d recommend pitching the writer first, with an angle specific to their beat. If a case needs to be made to the editor, it can fare better coming from the writer, who’s already had an opportunity to work out an angle with the PR rep. As an editor, I’m more likely to prioritize emails coming from those I have personal relationships with. These have been built over the years from the days when I was the writer presenting to my editors. Starting a new relationship with me as an editor, the most successful pitches have been those offering high profile interviews (editors that still write columns will want to take these for themselves before passing them off to junior writers) or highly specific content, like an original guest contribution.\"\nSome of these common structural elements include:\n\n\nAs the Internet has assumed growing prominence in the news cycle, press release writing styles have necessarily evolved. Editors of online newsletters, for instance, often lack the staff to convert traditional press release prose into more readable, print-ready copy.\n\nIn the traditional distribution model, the business, political campaign, or other entity releasing information to the media hires a publicity agency to write and distribute written information to the newswires. The newswire then disseminates the information as it is received or as investigated by a journalist.\n\nAn alternative is the \"self-published press release\". In this approach, press releases are either sent directly to local newspapers or to free and paid distribution services. The distribution service then provides the content, as-is, to their media outlets for publication which is usually online.\n\nSome public relations firms send out video news releases (VNRs) which are pre-taped video programs that can be aired intact by TV stations. Often, the VNRs are aired without the stations' identifying or attributing them as such.\n\nTV news viewers can often detect the use of VNRs within television newscasts; for example, many movie-star \"interviews\" are actually VNRs, taped on a set which is located at the movie studio and decorated with the movie's logo. Another frequent example of VNRs masquerading as news footage is videotapes of particular medical \"breakthroughs,\" that are really produced and distributed by pharmaceutical companies for the purpose of selling new medicines.\n\nVideo news releases can be in the form of full blown productions costing tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands. They can also be in the TV news format, or even produced for the web.\n\nRecently, many broadcast news outlets have discouraged the use of VNRs. Many stations, citing an already poor public perception, want to increase their credibility. Public relations companies are having a tougher time getting their pre-edited video aired.\n\nVNRs can be turned into podcasts then posted onto newswires. Further to this, a story can be kept running longer by engaging \"community websites\", which are monitored and commented on by many journalists and features writers.\n\nSometimes a press release is distributed early and embargoed – that is, news organizations are requested not to report the story until a specified time. For instance, news organizations usually receive a copy of presidential speeches several hours in advance. Product or media reviewers are commonly given a sample or preview of a product ahead of its release date.\n\nUnless the journalist has voluntarily agreed to honor the embargo in advance, usually via a legally binding non-disclosure agreement, the journalist is under no obligation to it. However, even in the absence of any obligation, news organizations generally do not break the embargo for sources that they wish to cultivate. If they do, then the agency or client that sent the release may blacklist them.\n\nPress release material can be beneficial towards media corporations because releases help decrease costs and improve the amount of material a firm can output in a certain amount of time. Due to the material being pre-packaged, this saves journalists time, not only in writing a story, but also the time and money it would have taken to capture the news firsthand. \n\nAlthough the utilization of press release material can save a company time and money, it makes the distributed media boring and similar to the output of other firms. In the digital age, consumers want to get their information instantly and this puts pressure on media companies to output as much material as possible. This often causes them to heavily rely on the use of press releases in order to create their stories.\n\nPress releases are crucial from the point of view of public companies.\n\n"}

A journal's SJR is a numeric value indicating the average number of weighted citations received during a selected year per document published in that journal during the previous three years. Higher SJR values are meant to indicate greater journal prestige. \n\nThe SJR indicator is a variant of the eigenvector centrality measure used in network theory. Such measures establish the importance of a node in a network based on the principle that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of the node. The SJR indicator has been developed to be used in extremely large and heterogeneous journal citation networks. It is a size-independent indicator and its values order journals by their \"average prestige per article\" and can be used for journal comparisons in science evaluation processes. The SJR indicator is a free journal metric inspired by, and using an algorithm similar to, PageRank.\n\nThe \"SJR indicator\" provides an alternative to the impact factor (IF) or average citations per document in a 2-year period, abbreviated as \"Cites per Doc. (2y)\".\n\nIf scientific impact is considered related to the number of endorsements, in the form of citations, a journal receives, then prestige can be understood as a combination of the number of endorsements and the prestige or importance of the journals issuing them. The \"SJR indicator\" assigns different values to citations depending on the importance of the journals where they come from. This way, citations coming from highly important journals will be more valuable and hence will provide more prestige to the journals receiving them. The calculation of the \"SJR indicator\" is very similar to the \"Eigenfactor score\", with the former being based on the Scopus database and the latter on the Web of Science database.\n\nThe SJR indicator computation is carried out using an iterative algorithm that distributes prestige values among the journals until a steady-state solution is reached. The SJR algorithm begins by setting an identical amount of prestige to each journal, then using an iterative procedure, this prestige is redistributed in a process where journals transfer their achieved prestige to each other through citations. The process ends up when the difference between journal prestige values in consecutive iterations do not reach a minimum threshold value any more. The process is developed in two phases, (a) the computation of \"Prestige SJR\" (\"PSJR\") for each journal: a size-dependent measure that reflects the whole journal prestige, and (b) the normalization of this measure to achieve a size-independent measure of prestige, the \"SJR indicator\".\n\n\n"}

Self-referential humor expressed discreetly and surrealistically is a form of bathos. In general, self-referential humor often uses hypocrisy, oxymoron, or paradox to create a contradictory or otherwise absurd situation that is humorous to the audience. \n\nSelf-referential humor is sometimes combined with breaking the fourth wall to explicitly make the reference directly to the audience, or make self-reference to an element of the medium that the characters should not be aware of.\n\nOld Comedy of Classical Athens is held to be the first—in the extant sources—form of self-referential comedy. Aristophanes, whose plays form the only remaining fragments of Old Comedy, used fantastical plots, grotesque and inhuman masks and status reversals of characters to slander prominent politicians and court his audience's approval.\n\nRAS syndrome refers to the redundant use of one or more of the words that make up an acronym or initialism with the abbreviation itself, thus in effect repeating one or more words.

It also reflects an excessive use of TLAs (Three Letter Acronyms).\n\nMeta has come to be used, particularly in art, to refer to something that is self-referential.

{"id": "673805", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=673805", "title": "Shield laws in the United States", "text": "Shield laws in the United States\n\nA shield law is legislation designed to protect reporters' privilege. This privilege involves the right of news reporters to refuse to testify as to information and/or sources of information obtained during the news gathering and dissemination process. Currently the U.S. federal government has not enacted any national shield laws, but most of the 50 states do have shield laws or other protections for reporters in place.\n\nA shield law is law that gives reporters protection against being forced to disclose confidential information or sources in state court. There is no federal shield law and state shield laws vary in scope. In general, however, a shield law aims to provide the classic protection of, \"a reporter cannot be forced to reveal his or her source\" law. Thus, a shield law provides a privilege to a reporter pursuant to which the reporter cannot be forced by subpoena or other court order to testify about information contained in a news story and/or the source of that information. Several shield laws additionally provide protection for the reporter even if the source or information is revealed during the dissemination of the news story, that is whether or not the source or information is confidential. Shield laws do not ensure absolute protection. Depending on the jurisdiction, the privilege may be total or qualified, and it may also apply to other persons involved in the news-gathering and dissemination process as well, such as an editor or a publisher.\n\nThe issue of whether or not journalists can be subpoenaed and forced to reveal confidential information arose in 1972 with the United States Supreme Court case \"Branzburg v. Hayes\". Paul Branzburg was a reporter for \"The Courier-Journal\" in Louisville, Kentucky and wrote an article about the drug hashish. In creating the article, he came in contact with two local citizens who had created and used the drug. Because their activity was illegal, Branzburg promised the two individuals that he would not reveal their identities. After the article was published, Branzburg was subpoenaed by a local grand jury and ordered to reveal the identity of his sources. Branzburg refused and cited the provisions for freedom of the press from the First Amendment of the Constitution, in his defense.\n\nThe case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court, where the court decided in a five to four decision that the press did not have a Constitutional right of protection from revealing confidential information in court. The court acknowledged, however, that the government must \"convincingly show a substantial relation between the information sought and a subject of overriding and compelling state interest.\" While this ruling did not set a precedent for journalistic rights in court, it did define a more stringent set of requirements for when a journalist could be subpoenaed in court.\n\nThis ruling was limited in nature, did not set a clear federal precedent regarding journalistic privileges from revealing confidential information, and thus has been interpreted and cited differently by courts over the years. The Third Circuit Court of Appeals, for instance, has gleaned a qualified First Amendment privilege from the \"Branzburg\" decision. In \"Riley v. City of Chester\", the Court held that a reporter's right to protect his sources from disclosure could be overcome by a party who, by a preponderance of the evidence, demonstrated that he has made an effort to obtain the information elsewhere, that the only access to the information sought is through the journalist and his or her source, and that the information sought is crucial to the case. 612 F.2d 708 (3rd Cir. 1979).\n\nStates differ on their approach to protecting reporter's privilege. , 49 states and the District of Columbia offer some form of protections Forty states (plus D.C.) have passed shield laws. These laws vary from state to state. Some protections apply to civil but not to criminal proceedings. Other laws protect journalists from revealing confidential sources, but not other information. Many states have also established court precedents which provide protection to journalists, usually based on constitutional arguments. Only Wyoming lacks both legislation and judicial precedent to protect reporter's privilege.\n\nProponents of shield laws argue that they ensure that news gatherers may do their jobs to their fullest ability and that they help avoid a dichotomy between state laws and journalistic ethics, but the differences between states' laws has raised questions regarding which laws apply where in regard to national reporting. Proponents argue that a federal shield law should exist to eliminate contradictions between state laws.\n\nOpponents argue that shield laws afford extra privileges to journalists and that no citizen should be able to ignore a court ordered subpoena. Opponents also cite problems with defining who is considered a journalist or news gatherer and who is not, and note that if journalists get special protection from the government, then they are getting special journalistic benefits from the government instead of acting in complete independence. Some opponents also argue that journalists are often forced to testify by federal courts only in cases where a federal shield law likely would not protect them anyway. Finally, the federal government may not have constitutional right to enforce a shield law on state courts.\n\nMany journalists, however, are subpoenaed to testify in criminal and civil cases for coverage of a variety of matters that do not involve questions of national security. In recent years, there have been bills for federal shield laws in the United States Congress; however, none of these bills have passed the Senate. A primary objection to recent efforts to pass a federal shield law has been concern about leaks of classified information, particularly given the modern potential of such leaks to be published globally on the Internet by non-traditional recipients, such as WikiLeaks, who might claim to be \"journalists\" under an unqualified shield law.\n\nSometimes, the press is not even immune from its sources, such as when the source wishes to remain anonymous and the journalist wishes to disclose it. Such was the case in \"Cohen v. Cowles Media Co.\" (1991). The Supreme Court upheld that a source may have a right to confidentiality if an agreement was made with the reporter. Unfortunately, the bigger issue of source disclosure gets even more confusing, since the \"Cohen\" and \"Branzburg\" decisions could allow for the possibility of a journalist being subpoenaed by a court to disclose the name of a source, and being sued by a source under promissory estoppel laws for that disclosure. The current laws of the land, and the gray areas of forecasting potential consequences of publishing a story with confidential sources places the press in a very precarious situation. The current shield laws in some states give the press somewhat of an upper hand. However, since federal law does not recognize reportorial privilege in most cases, it is understandable how the press might feel muzzled.\n\nThe shield law privilege may also be waived by a reporter, as the New Jersey Supreme Court recently found in the case of \"In re Michael G. Venezia\". In that case, a New Jersey newspaper published an article containing defamatory statements about the plaintiff. The article attributed the statements to a source who was identified by name in the article; the source later denied making the defamatory statements. The plaintiff filed a defamation lawsuit against the newspaper, the reporter and the alleged source of the defamatory statements. When the plaintiff sought to question the newspaper reporter about the article, the reporter and his newspaper refused, claiming protection under New Jersey's shield law. It was discovered, however, that the reporter had already given a statement under oath concerning the article—and, most important, the alleged source of the statement and exactly what that source said—to a local county prosecutor's office. The reporter also talked about his source and what the source said with a local municipal attorney. The \"Venezia\" court unanimously held that, while New Jersey has arguably the most protective shield law in the United States, a reporter waives the privilege when he talks about his sources and information outside of the newsgathering process, as did the reporter in \"Venezia.\" The \"Venezia\" court stated: \"The privilege holder is not permitted to step from behind the shield as he pleases, sallying forth one moment to make a disclosure to one person and then to seek the shield's protection from having to repeat the same disclosure to another person. A reporter cannot play peek-a-boo with the privilege.\" Thus, the \"Venezia\" court ordered that the reporter must submit to the plaintiff's deposition request. \"Venezia\" is highly significant because it marks the first time that a reporter has ever been found to have waived the privilege under New Jersey's current shield law, and because it explores the issue of what is or is not a \"newsgathering activity,\" and, thus, what activities are subject to protection under the law.\n\nCurrently, courts are struggling to define the standards for when shield laws should apply to non-traditional media outlets, particularly in the context of blogs and Internet publishing. In \"Obsidian Finance Group, LLC v. Cox\", the United States District Court for the District of Oregon found that to qualify as a reporter, a standard of professionalism must be met, including but not limited to being associated with a traditional news print or television media outlet or obtaining a journalism degree. A subsequent opinion in the same case clarified that these were examples and not requirements; bloggers could qualify, and the denial of media status in the Cox case appears to have been largely motivated by the defendant reportedly offering to remove accusations for a substantial fee. Conversely, in \"The Mortgage Specialists, Inc. v. Implode-Explode Heavy Industries, Inc.\" the New Hampshire Supreme Court adopted a much broader definition of media that applies to blogs and website curators, reiterating that \"freedom of the press is a fundamental personal right which is not confined to newspapers and periodicals.\"\n\nIn July 2013 the White House was pushing for a federal media shield law named the Free Flow of Information Act authored by U.S. Senators Charles Schumer and Lindsey Graham. Under the bill, the scope of protection for reporters would vary according to whether it was a civil case, an ordinary criminal case or a national security case. The greatest protection would be given to civil cases, in which litigants seeking to force reporters to testify or trying to obtain their calling information would be required to show why their need for the information outweighed the public's interest in unfettered news gathering. Ordinary criminal cases would work in a similar fashion, except the burden would be on the reporter seeking to quash the subpoena to show by a \"clear and convincing\" standard that the public interest in the free flow of information should prevail over the needs of law enforcement. Cases involving the disclosure of classified information would be more heavily tilted toward the government. Judges could not quash a subpoena through a balancing test if prosecutors presented facts showing that the information sought might help prevent a terrorist attack or other acts likely to harm national security. The legislation would create a presumption that when the government is seeking calling records from a telephone carrier, the news organization would be notified ahead of time, allowing it to fight the subpoena in court. But the bill would also allow the government to seek a 45- to 90-day delay in notification if a court determines that such notice would threaten the integrity of the investigation. The legislation would also include an exception where journalists could be subpoenaed if it means national security is at risk. \"Now, it's important to remember: virtually the only time the government subpoenas reporters, it involves leak investigations into stories by national security reporters. So it's hard to see how this bill will significantly help improve press freedom,\" wrote Trevor Timm, an activist with the Electronic Frontier Foundation and a board member of the Freedom of the Press Foundation. \"Worse, there's a strong argument that passing the bill [...] will weaken rights reporters already have and make it easier for the government to get sources from reporters.\"\n\nIn recent years, a larger effort by journalists to press for federal shield laws formed following the Plame affair/CIA leak scandal, in which reporters who released the name of Valerie Plame were asked who their sources were. One of the reporters, Judith Miller of \"The New York Times\", was jailed for 85 days in 2005 for refusing to disclose her source in the government probe.\n\nThere is a question about whether journalists should be exempt from national security laws, or not.\n\n\n"}

He edited the Brotherhood's literary magazine \"The Germ\" which published four issues in 1850 and wrote the poetry reviews for it.\n\nIt was William Michael Rossetti who recorded the aims of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood at their founding meeting in September 1848:\n\n\nAlthough Rossetti worked full-time as a civil servant, he maintained a prolific output of criticism and biography across a range of interests from Algernon Swinburne to James McNeill Whistler. He edited the diaries of his maternal uncle John William Polidori (author of \"The Vampyre\" and physician to Lord Byron), a comprehensive biography of D. G. Rossetti, and edited the collected works of D. G. Rossetti and Christina Rossetti.\n\nRossetti edited the first British edition of the poetry of Walt Whitman, which was published in 1868; however, this edition was bowdlerized.\nAnne Gilchrist, who became one of the first to write about Whitman, first read his poetry from Rossetti's edition, and Rossetti helped initiate their correspondence.\n\nIn 1874 he married Lucy Madox Brown, daughter of the painter Ford Madox Brown. They honeymooned in France and Italy. Their first child, Olivia Frances Madox, was born in September 1875, and her birth was celebrated in an ode of Swinburne's. A son, Gabriel Arthur, was born in February 1877, followed by another daughter, Helen Maria, in November 1879, and twins, Mary Elizabeth and Michael Ford, in April 1881. Their son Michael died in infancy. Rossetti and his wife did not have the children baptized, nor were they raised in a Christian household. The children were schooled at home by their mother and governesses. In 1897, Olivia married an Italian anarchist refugee, Antonio Agresti. They later moved to Italy, where Olivia became a translator and writer. After she was widowed in 1926, she became an associate of Ezra Pound, and the two corresponded frequently.\n\nGabriel Arthur, known as Arthur to the family, became a scientist, married Dora Lewis, and had several children. Helen became a painter of miniatures, and in 1903 married Gastone Angeli. He was in fragile health and died only a few months later. Helen gave birth to his posthumous daughter, Imogen Lucy, in 1904.\n\nWilliam Michael Rossetti was a major contributor to the 1911 edition of the \"Encyclopædia Britannica\"; his contributions on artistic subjects were criticised by many reviewers at the time and since, as showing little evidence of having absorbed the mounting body of work by academic art historians, mostly writing in German. Below is a quotation from his article on Fra Angelico demonstrating his literary and art-historical style.\n\nThe \"pietistic\" quality of Fra Angelico's work is in fact its predominant characteristic. The faces of his figures have an air of rapt suavity, devotional fervency and beaming esoteric consciousness, which is intensely attractive to some minds ... the faces becoming sleek and prim, with a smirk of sexless religiosity which hardly eludes the artificial or even the hypocritical; because of this, there are some who are not moved by his work. Even so, Fra Angelico is a notable artist within his sphere... . \n\n\n\n"}
